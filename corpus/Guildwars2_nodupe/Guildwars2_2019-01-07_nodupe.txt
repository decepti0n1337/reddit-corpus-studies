Which gathering tools should I be using?
---
---
---
Events are usually where it's at. For both people and more experience. They are those orange things that pop up on the minimap. 
---
Creepy looking characters.
---
Not sure which one is mini though...
---
Elementalist - played a few classes so far and I realised that elementalist is the only class that does wide range aoe burst damage. I'm not referring to cleave, I'm referring to being able to deal huge damage to enemies that are spread out in a wide area. The drawback is their squishiness.
---
That is probably why they rushed it, lel. See y'all at tuesday. 
---
You want good stuff but it has to be cheap? Yeah OK...
---

---
Can you replay the first story chapter on the same character to get all the collections for Raise the Banners: Amnoon Arbitrator, or can you only do one per character?
---
of.
---
I'll bite here, what's the attack?
---
&gt;But whatever, you aren't taken seriously for a reason.
---
This?, lmao.
---
I just checked my old twitch and I have a VOD from when I made my first legendary in 2013, has the old LA and everything in it. My gear was so hideous back then but we had no wardrobe system so it was extremely impractical and unintuitive to work with the transmutation crystals. The trading post also looked SOOO much different.

Good times.

If you want a workaround while doing another achievement, look into doing this: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Class_I_Rift_Stabilizer
---
It’s a fun little gizmo to use here and then and gets you to the platform too
---
Are you f2p or do you have expansions? Do you have any level boosts available? If so, you could consider using one. It isn't recommended for a first character, but it is possible to just learn everything at 80. 
---
I am going to be pretty brutally honest next. Gw2 is very tailored to a single player experience. There are group play options like fractals and raids and pvp, but the majority of the game's content is balanced for the individual player. For example, loot and experienced are earned from just hitting a mob, you don't have to hit it first or last or do the majority of the damage. Gathering nodes are all individual based and no one can steal your nodes. Events are tailored and scaled so that basically everyone gets to get full credit from them. The game mostly doesn't force you to group up with anyone. It's kind of like a single player game that other player are also in. This may not be your kind of game. I for one love it as I have to rely on random other people as little as possible, and only really when I specifically am doing content that I am looking for that kind of gameplay on. It is also possible to exclusively play group content at Max level, but a hardcore raider with likely run out of content, and a hardcore pvper will probably feel like their content is neglected. 
---
Now advice for you. It may be that the character that you are playing isn't for you, or maybe you should change up your build. If you are playing a greatsword warrior, try out sword/sword condition damage warrior or something else radically different. You also may be focussing on the wrong content. A lot of people find the hearts to be pretty boring, so finding event chains may be better. Also, keep in mind that experience is scaled to your level, so you can level in lower level zones and will only get a slight penalty. You could also try spvp. You can get tomes of knowledge that give you 1 character level per. You get them pretty often. Your character is set to level 80 in spvp so won't be at a disadvantage in level or gear (normalized), though if you don't have expansions the elite specs are very strong.
---
&gt; - "Eye Of The Storm!": In addition to its previous effects, this skill now also grants Shocking Aura), so that it gains the same aura-providing utility like its counterparts.
---
Absolutely no way. There's a reason why it doesn't give a shocking aura. That would be sooo damn stupid in PvP, especially since that shout already has a trait activation and Tempest are already in a good spot (2nd best support after Firebrand).
---
&gt; After reporting it, what else to do? Pray?
---
Play!
---
YES! For things like silverwaste shovels :p 
---
Bahaha I love that answer x)
---
How do you know they didnt receive temporary bans?
---
In addition to what everyone else is saying, make alts and leveling them up is much easier in gw2 compared to other MMOs. I had the same concerns as well but then just made other classes . 
---
i think for this to work it would have to be made as in, homer norn, marge, lisa and bart humans, and maggie asura. 
---
and you'd have to disregard skin tone.
---
3-4 minutes? Who is the jerk fighting at range  and making it run around?!
---
I'm not OP, but they don't get karma for text-only posts, which this is, so maybe take your negativity elsewhere.
---
because even the most high profile ones didn't receive bans, they got temporary dishonour, the pve players got permanent dishonour but they don't care because they are pve players. it's pretty self explanatory if they are doing it constantly, if they got temp bans one would assume that would lead to a perma ban if they continued to do it, yet that doesn't happen.
---
Firebrand is also a solid tank option for PvE raids and that should be noted in the above, especially after the chrono nerfs
---
You can use mounts nearly everywhere. Even if you can enter your home instance from anywhere it would not be as relevant or impactful.
---
I don't think that's a mini
---
I have one 80 in each profession, all leveled naturally. 
---
I just constantly change around my build, swap weapons around to try them all out, since early maps aren't at all punishing.  
---
Map completion gives a good chunk of experience (made super easy by mounts), I do events as I get near, keep pushing for higher level maps, and by then I usually have my next story point. I keep Strawberry Ghosts on hand (not limited by F2P account) and whatever cheap utility makes sense for a +25% exp from kills. You can get exp boosters from some storyline, so keep an eye out for those. 
---
If you need extra motivation, you get a Black Lion Chest Key once a week at level 10, and anytime when you hit levels 40 &amp; 60 (then 2 more at 80 on LWS2-Tangled Paths, and HoT-Roots of Terror).
---
I know you're getting some hate but I agree. HoT fucking sucked and killed the game for me.HoT always felt rushed not just the story but the gameplay as well always feels like you are being swept away by the current. I much prefer the laid back approach of the PoF maps. Always felt the PoF story made more sense and was more complete as well, but you know how opinions are.
---
Nah, it's not you, it's the Springer.
---
Mounts break core Tyria maps really, really badly.  It's unfortunately exceedingpyneasy to accidentally land outside the map going for a vista or something.
---
Outfits don't count to fashion wars.
---
The worst part of the treasure hunting kit isn't even the reward but the implementation.  If you loot a chest, it deletes your kit. 
---
However, **the worst feature of the treasure hunting kits** is the fact each player is limited to only one chest at a time, instead of enabling them to search for chests all over the map.
---
Had they done it like Silverwastes shovels, it would have been extremely fun feature, we may have even seen trains. But they didn't.
---
I usually complete it in 1-2 minutes. There is way too many skips and shortcuts not even taking in account mounts.
---
New player here, just committed a sin and boosted to 80 (Warrior).
---
1. What's the easiest way to get a mount?
---
2. Am I forced to completing these class-specific stories (10-80) before unlocking elite specializations? I'm keen to get into the end-game content (dungeons, raids, pvp) but running around the map to sit through cut-scenes and mob killing is getting suuuper grindy
---
Is the example supposed to be a meaningful choice? You take soul reaping since more time spent in shroud = higher dps. Am i missing something? 
---
I largely agree with the OP.  For me personally, I feel the Path of Fire expansion breathed new life into the game.  Prior to the release of Path of Fire, I had largely quit GW2 because I didn’t like the direction the game was heading in at the time.  My experience with Heart of Thorns was largely a negative one.  
---
I didn’t like the Heart of Thorns storyline nor did I like the storyline being gated behind mastery grinding.  Outside of the glider and elite specialisation, there weren’t any rewards I was interested in grinding for.  Lastly, there were large amount of bugs in HoT that weren’t fixed until a year or two after HoT was released.  
---
Path of Fire honestly took me by surprise.  The expansion was set in Elona, which was surprising as it had been speculated for years that “Elona content” was never going to happen.  The expansion featured mounts, which was also speculated as something that would never happen.  What was also surprising was the fact that the expansion did not feature an Elder Dragon as the main villain (which was a refreshing change of pace).  
---
In term of what I thought about Path of Fire after I played it, I thought the expansion was very good. The storyline was good, with Balthazar and Joko stealing every scene they were in.  From a gameplay perspective, I thought the developers did a great job with implementing mounts in GW2, particularly the physics and the masteries.  I also thought the developers did a good job with end game content such as the griffin quest and the legendary bounties.  
---
If you can't see how that's an attack we're done here
---
I feel like this has been posted before.
---
You could give world bosses a try. The are timers out there with WPs. They are typically well attended and fun for the first 20 or 30 runs.
---
Easy fix: log onto another char. Put one of those revive orbs that you never have a good use for into your shared slots, change back, revive 
---
Nice try, Jessica. 
---
[Woof!](https://imgur.com/a/qtjmViQ)
---
No one asked :D
---
1. There's only one way - do first instance of PoF story (H menu).  
---
2. You don't need to do any story at all. However, first instance of each expac is required for unlocking their masteries and first part of every episode after (including) living season 3 is required for unlocking their map.
---
&gt; Surely they have to realise you cant force people to do things and getting angry at stuff you cannot control is not productive?   
---
They probably do realise. But it's really annoying when simple events end up failing because some people are too lazy to use a waypoint. So even tho there's no point in getting frustrated and lashing out, i do understand why people do so.
---
I think the just cycle the different tools. It might be better to wait until ones with the glyphs you are interested in shows up.
---
I am amazed you're going through this much trouble.
---
Thank you.
---
[this might be my thread](https://i.imgur.com/0DdKxVu.png)
---
It's best to just load up a relaxing playlist and kick back.  If people want to get stressed out and frustrated then there's nothing you'll be able to do to convince them otherwise.  Just let them get it out of their system and if they're particularly egregious block them. 
---
&gt; I'm 100% biased but I think Mesmer is the most versatile class. 
---
I don't think that's biased tbh, they can basically do everything. It's the "unique" class of GW2 if you will. 
---
Mike Z was the lead iirc from various interviews.  He became Game Director after POF's release.  He was (and still is) Design Lead and Lead Content Designer so ultimately he was the 'go to guy' from what I understand.

---
Is there an easy way of doing this puzzle? I plan on completing it this week, but just the thought of it terrifies me
---
Everything about your post confuses me. What "grind"? Did you grind mobs or something? Or camp the same event chain? Why all night and all day? Are you implying that it took forever?
---
The last 15 levels usually go by like the wind. Between story XP, the monster event hub that is Orr and several dungeons opening up in the end, you turn 80 faster than you can actually do all the lvl70-80 content.
---
How it usually goes for me (I often play at peak hours): first 30 seconds the boss HP drops to 50%, breakbar takes until the last second to break if it even does break (sign that people have finally captured the camp below and taken the ship), rest 50% of HP takes a solid 3-4 minutes because of 111111 and dead bodies. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Tbh, I only want shocking aura on Eye implemented to get revenge on spin-to-win Thieves.
---
[Best I could do.](https://imgur.com/GqtXByw)
---
I don't think that's entirely true with the current state of core Ele traits.
---
Fire provides additional condi cleanse, Fury and 25 stacks of Might, Arcane provides powerful resurrection potential plus additional healing, while earth provides protection and some stability. It depends on what content you play. 
---
Water is mandatory though 
---
It is not there but I am able to start the story via the hero tab. My question is, though, do I need to start the story now or can I wait till later. In other worfs, if I dont start playing now, will it lock again later?
---
Think you got as close as anyone can in GW2.  Good job!
---
You are the one of the rarer new players that enjoyed the level grind. I for one am part of the crowd that level/mob grind was a norm back in 2012 but the MMO players these days give up half way into leveling, some (excuse my language) pathetically stop at level 15.
---
Druid is usually played for end game as [might](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Might) and [regen](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Regeneration) generators
---
Whereas, soulbeast, it's easier to play as double shortbow condition DPS.
---
In either case, welcome to the end game content. Now, you have unlocked dungeon speed runs, fractals, raids, and newer living story episodes/collections.
---
Does logging out of a dead character and going back actually keep you dead? 
---
The final fight of PoF actually is one of the harder fights I've done solo as well. HoT final fight for me was a cakewalk 
---
HoT is at least twice harder than PoF in terms of traversing the maps, fighting around ads. However, we can use mounts in HoT to avoid unnecessary fights which is a lifesaver.. back then, we only had the option to walk and glide - imagine that.
---
&gt; You are grossly oversimplifying now. 
---
Congratulations, you understand irony.
---
&gt; Those are amusing weapon stats though. I play Guardian, Thief, Warrior, and a tiny bit of Necro. Every other class has all or all but one according to you. 
---
Not sure how what you play is really relevant unless you mean to insinuate that as a reason for being so off-base. Hopefully not because the combined 60% weapon usage of those classes is still 3x your initial exaggeration. Pretty large margin of error there.
---
And I'll clarify again that none of this is _according to me_. It's simply stated statistics, presented clearly and without bias, that anyone can go and figure up themselves. But you're right, it is definitely amusing to see how fast people are willing to throw out wildly inaccurate numbers without any real thought behind it.
---
&gt; Necro blood magic is a perfect example . . . Both trait lines go unused in pve because all that matters is that 10% damage mod. Take that away and adjust base damage accordingly and you have a genuine choice that affects gameplay without viability.
---
Have you not raided or ran fracs anytime in the last few months? Are you really trying to tell me you've never seen a support scourge in PvE? 
---
Disregarding that, surely you aren't thinking that the removal of a single damage multiplier would allow for vast differentiation in meta builds? It would just be recalculated and a new build would form with the next best damage option.
---
You seem to have this false notion that traits are the underlying cause of the DPS meta and that if you remove those pesky DPS traits that the meta will magically branch out to offer all these different options that we haven't seen before. The metagame of GW2 is not "bring as much support as you can" or "have the most build diverse party possible", the meta is "kill the thing before the thing can kill you, in the most efficient way possible". That means streamlining boon generation to as few classes as possible, streamlining sustain the same way, using the smallest amount possible of all the extra stuff so we can cram in as much DPS as possible. That is not an issue with traits.  That is an issue with player mentality and fundamental game mechanics. Turns out GW2 favors high DPS builds fundamentally, so the meta builds reflect that. 
---
&gt;"Everyone is the same" is not a viable argument, I urge you to think of a real one.
---
I really shouldn't even address this because it's obviously a childish jab with no real grounds, but if you really want to claim something as outlandish as an argument not being "real", _I urge you_ to at least throw some catchphrase fallacies or argumentative syntax in so we can at least laugh about it like a bad example from freshman Rhetoric and Comp.
---
Fun fact: During weekend previews we could be dismounted by force around these areas.
---
mmm, 64 slices of krytan cheese
---
Just as an FYI, if you log in every day for 28 days, you will end up with 16 Tomes (levels).  If you do that 2x you are at 32 levels which is nearly halfway to 80!  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I would also recommend Edge of the Mists trains if you can find any that are going.  That gave a lot of levels for me on several characters.  
---
That's a fair point.  Luckily it hasn't really been much of an issue that I've seen in open world since the HoT rework when Gerent was gutted.
---
But man did it piss me off back with core - before mega servers - doing Balth temple and 4-6 people were laying there dead from 90% through the rest of the fight.  Or worse when you wiped and if they had run back the priest may have still been in combat.  I got so salty back then.
---
With power creep/open world design now, it doesn't really matter for the most part.
---
Blindfolds imply that they're looking. 
---
I felt the same way for literally YEARS.  It took HOT for me to like some of the professions because I really didn't like ANY of them in vanilla.  I enjoyed Daredevil, Dragon Hunter, and Herald in HOT though.  I learned to love Druid when I got into raiding and started using it more.
---
None of the POF specs really grabbed me.  I was (and still am) disappointed with Deadeye.  Mirage and Firebrand are just OK IMO.  The rest of them I'm kinda just like "meh".
---
Since your original question got answered, some additional info on PVP :
---
PoF brings some PVP oriented /very viable PVP elite specializations with scourge (necro), spellbreaker (warrior), mirage (mesmer), soulbeast (ranger) and Firebrand (guardian)
---
If you haven't heard of it yet, elite specialization are new traitlines you can unlock after purchasing one of the expansions, which change the playstyle of a class way more than the "classic" traitlines. They even grant you the ability to weild a new weapontype (only if you use the specialization) 
---
That sounds strangely ffun...
---
Good luck with the Shining Blade!  Sorry to hear you petered out on Dusk.  I never tried crafting a gen 1 pre, but I had a blast with the journeys for Nevermore and wish they had kept doing those sorts of things for the latest legendaries.
---
It is all according to you.
---
You can be as condescending as you like, but every number you pulled out is according to you. The only class that has any semblance of choice on what weapon to use is Ranger, currently. And the only thing they "get to choose" is mainhand on one of their weapon swaps, because there's a whole 3 viable options.
---
You have a preconceived notion and you think I'm an idiot for thinking we can have something better. There's no point in talking to you, apparently.
---
Hi, refugee of Maple Story 2, hoping to find a better MMO. Before trying GW2, I'm hoping to get answers to the following questions:
---
1. How much money does it require to lift the restrictions free players have?
---
2. Since the game has been out for so long (6 years I believe), is it still welcoming to new players or have I missed so much content that I'd feel lost and out of place?
---
3. I live on the east side of the US, what's the best and most populated server/world/place-thingie for me to join?
---
4. Any GW2 memes/sayings I should know and pick up on?
---
Thank you for reading my inquiries, have a great day. :)
---
yeah my favorite thing to do when replaying the pof main story is talk to Qais and canyon jump past the signs, through the casino, over the guests, straight into Zalamburs office
---
but mace isn't meta anywhere; and all underwater weapons see some use =P
---
There are so many details like this in GW2 that so many of us ignore or miss.  5k hours and I never knew about these specific NPC's.  You're basically taking the time to "smell the roses" so to speak, and that's wonderful!
---
I really fucking love the mini quests for the T1 legendaries i think theyre super fun, but once it gets to the "bring me 1 million of everything" and spend 1000g, i get so tired of it
---
If you have anymore questions, try the weekly question thread that's stickied. Comments usually get replies within the hour and people never judge, so the "stupidest" questions are still answered with a proper and appropriate answer. 
---
Which is why they stopped doing that when the realized the problem with it, and made Living World Season 2 and onward instanced, repeatable content.
---
I don't know who downvoted you because you're the only person that is correct. It seems a lot of people don't remember the infamous Arah Thief tanks or don't realize the power of Magi Thief or Harrier Deadeye. Not even mentioning the multiple dps builds we have for bosses, dungeons, and fractals to absolutely carry teams when it comes to CC.
---
I didn't know that!  I wonder if they removed that so the dismount zone didn't interfere with the casino coin event?
---
You're missing a lot, but whatever.
---
You're highlighting the problem perfectly though.
---
Watch out for that first episode; it's a doozy.
---
Now do Lord Moldy Butt!
---
I’m sorry to hear about that, 13 hours shifts seems awfully long. 
---
I don’t really have a main My thief is both DD and DE my necro is both scourge and reaper and I play soulbeast and mirage all of them almost equal time I think except for mirage he’s the newest fella to my gang.
---
Have fun crafting the incinerator it really looks cool and dagger is pretty useful for most classes that use it so I’m pretty sure it’ll come handy 
---
Which of the natural metallic and leather are your favorites?
---
&gt; How much does it cost?
---
The cost of the expansions. 
---
Don't think of GW2 as a Free to Play game. Think of GW2 as a Buy to Play game with a hilariously generous free trial. Play free for a few days, and if you like it, but the expansions. You only need one, but I would get both. 
---
You can usually find if on sale for 40 or 50% off somewhere which actually comes to the same price as buying just one expansion at full cost. 
---
Check dlgamer, a licensed reseller. They almost always have a sale on.
---
&gt; Welcoming 
---
I'd actually say that the community is more welcoming to new players than existing ones. Seriously.
---
&gt; Server
---
Doesn't matter. Server is an almost deprecated and only means anything for one PvP game mode. Just pick one that says America.
---
&gt; Memes and shit
---
Not really to be honest. Nothing you would understand as a new player just starting the story anyway.
---
Price was incredibly vile. Fries was disreputable. Satisfied?
---
Thank you for the help!
---
1. You have to buy either one of the expansions, purchasing the core game isn't possible anymore.
---
2. It's very forgiving in that regard. Max level has always been 80, the strongest tier of armor/weapons in the game are still the same, low level areas are still populated because high level players get scaled down etc.
---
3. Servers only matter for World vs World (huge PvP maps where servers fight against other servers about keeps, towers etc.)
---
Everything else runs on a so called Megaserver system.
---
4. Uh, besides the usual MMORPG lingo? Praise Joko! Ok, just kidding. You have your typical abbreviations like dps, cc, aggro and so on. There is WP which stands for Waypoint (once explored you can teleport to a waypoint for a small fee), HP which means hero point (points which you get for leveling up and doing stuff in the world, with them you can train defensive skills and passive traitlines) and comm/mentor. Commander and Mentors are shown on your map with special icons and typically show that there is something interesting happening OR (which applies more to Mentors) are willing to help and explain stuff to new players. Commander tags look like colorful triangels or little cat-heads and Mentors are little apple symbols.
---
Hope that helps :) 
---
Thx for the info!
---
Np. check out dlgamer.com also. They are authorised retailer.
---
Thank you for answering my questions.
---
No, she absolutely did. Telling someone that you "don't have to pretend to like them" because you're no longer communicating with them via the official AMA is a clear sign of utter contempt.
---
In the beta testing you were. I’m not sure why the removed it but kept the sign. 
---
In PvP everything unlocks automatically from level 1 (you get scaled up to level 80). Dungeons can be done without elite specs since they were designed before these specialisations where in the game. As for the other stuff, look for HP runs in the Verdant Brink lfg (first map of HoT) or in Crystal Oasis (first map of PoF) although PoF can be soloed easily. Also, each HP in the expansion maps gives you 10 points, not only 1.
---
There's no reason. I saw every word she wrote. She took a legitimate question, got bent completely out of shape in an unbelievably disproportionate fashion over it, then turned it into an identity politics issue - specifically, a hissy fit about her being female.
---
I love it 
---
I don't know the answer tbh, but wouldn't that be weird? When the counsil asks us to pick one, our character says "last time when I was here I picked Joko, so I go with them again?"!!! 
---
I will say, you *can* still get keys for the base game that can lift f2p restrictions without adding expansion content. However, you can't purchase those directly: they come mostly from bundles and promotions. The other responses are correct that the most practical way is to buy an expansion.
---
I don't usually share this because a couple of the screenshots are not mine, but I whipped this together for a friend coming from Maplestory 2

Thanks so much!  Very helpful!
---
Would be neat, when GW2 was released its underwater gameplay was revolutionary in the genre, but nowadays it’s become more of a fun fact than an integral part of  gameplay.
---
An expansion set mostly underwater would be a huge welcome and change of pace for me
---
Thanks so much!  
---
Yeah pretty much. Even thinking about an expansion that takes place primarily with this game's underwater combat makes me cringe, much less fully with it.
---
I love well done underwater games, guild wars 2 isnt one of them.
---
Btw, do you think the 32 bit client is more stable than the 64?
---
Point in case.
---
play ranger or guardian
---
Was a reaper?
---
I guess, yeah, when one person thinks it's okay to treat another person the way Price treated Deroir, I get pretty outraged. If that somehow offends you, then I guess you have the right to be offended.
---
OUT AM I?
---
that's not what i thought when i saw Aquaman. the only thing i was concerned with is that we finally know what Steve looks like. (not gonna say what due to spoilers. anyone who saw the movie knows what im talking about ;) )
---
That's just wrong. In PvE, mace is meta on Renegade dps and even mace/mace (perfect for Twice told) is meta on power warrior for CC. 
---
A legendary dagger doesnt replace an exotic scepter. They are two different things; one is the most versatile dagger, but if you need a scepter in that slot, the dagger wont help you at all.
---
Thanks! 
---
It is. Really add more depths to the game in my opinion.
---
ok, but your thread is witchhunting and it's against the reddit ToS. I gave you a reason that the player could be legit. It doesn't matter if it's true or not, you're witchhunting
---
On the topic of getting exotic gear, note that you don’t necessarily have to craft / buy crafted lv80 exotics! There are cheaper options on the Trading Post, particularly monster drop variants. If you click on an armor section (e.g. Chest) and click the gear next to the search bar, you can narrow down what kind of equipment you’re looking for. E.g Power, Precision, Ferocity, Exotics. So for example, instead of buying a crafted lv80 heavy armor zerks chestpiece for 8g, you could buy the lv80 monster drop variant for 2g, or the lv78 variant for 36 silver.
---
The spectrums are actually a nice way of thinking about it. I definately need to fiddle around with my classes more and the spectrum mentality can lead me down interesting paths.

The only one of those seven weapons that is currently not included somewhere in the meta is Staff (recently phased out after nerfs than made it too tedious to be worth playing). 
---
I could demonstrate to you how I "pulled" the rest of the numbers but I'm sure you can understand after one example. It's not _according to me_, it's according to the current meta. Anyone else on the subreddit could have pulled the same exact numbers as me. 
---
And if you really think giving the option for every weapon to be viable for every sub-build for the class then you're entirely undermining Anet's intention of having different weapons provide different skillsets in the first place. They tune the weapons to be viable for different builds for a reason.
---
I don't think you're an idiot, I just think your version of "something better" does not fit with the current picture that is Guild Wars 2. It's more like how you envision your perfect game.
---
The Griffin questline and leg bounties aren't endgame thought. 
---
Yeah sure.. I had been planning on doing a cleaner more generic version at some point anyway, so in the meantime people can do whatever with this one.
---
You'll just have to wait until it rotates back into the gem store sometime in the future.
---
Stickin' it to the Man! BOOYAH!
---
My "perfect game" wouldn't be anything like GW2. The fact that GW2 moved backwards from what GW1 achieved is a joke in the face of good games everywhere.
---
WvW and Fractals and PvP are super easy ways to get them.
---
New players during bandit executioner event in queensdale
---
No. I remember when Super Mario Bros came out on NES and everyone pretty much decided that water levels sucked. 
---
I wouldn’t mind one but,I’m not really a fan of how GW2 handles underwater in such a fantastic way.
---
Haha that’s great. Wow nice. I’m excited to get it. 
---
How many funerary incenses do you have left?
---
I actually am going for the Gift of Maguuma so none needed this time. I had to get those for iPod and I hated having to wait for bounty trains. 
---
I start by determining what my next character is going to be.  I then craft a set of armor and weapons - ascended if I have the materials, with exotic for filler.  I then buy a full set of ascended trinkets and breather - their LWS3 map completion starts replenishing the currency spent on gear.  I buy their bags and toss everything into a bank tab for easy pickup.  I then go to character creation and hope to heck the name I have picked out is free.  After that, one of the following:
---
* 20 Scroll (gained from a character's first birthday) + 58 - 59 tomes of knowledge.
---
* 78 - 79 tomes of knowledge if I don't have any scrolls.
---
* Mad King's Labyrinth until my brain melts (with boosters I can grind out around 10 levels an hour), though this is seasonal.
---
Lately I stop at level 49 and clean bags out of my bank, then take the character to 80 after loot is sorted.  I move my inventory window so the Tome stack is under the OK button and flail on the left mouse button until the stack is gone.
---
If I have the resources I take the character into WvW and buy at least 180 testimonies of heroics - this is a huge chunk of map completion and greatly cuts down the number of HoT or PoF HPs needed to unlock an elite spec down to a number that can be done solo.
---
Full setup and fashion wars takes a couple of hours.  After which all XP gained from map completion goes to spirit shards.
---
In all honesty Lab is probably the best tomeless method.  Though it's only available a few weeks a year, scaling works incredibly well - you can bring a very low level character in, grind it all the way up to 80, and be earning relatively valuable loot at the same time.
---
I have also no idea.
---
Why does this get removed when a meme post with even less effort has over 1k upvotes.
---

---
&gt;Did anyone else watch Aquaman...
---
Hell no
---
&gt;...and get really excited for an entirely underwater GW2 expansion?
---
HELL no!!
---
Sometimes i just want to watch the fight while dead. Pls dont hate all dead players. :(
---
Oh I see. I’m just gonna play WvW for the trade contracts. And just do the daily hearts for the essences. 
---
Excited for us both to get it! HMU when you do - I’d love to see it. 
---
Haha I’m tempted to get the cryomancer glider skin to go with it. I like to imagine my FB sucking the heat from the world and using it to give off righteous flames. 
---
"I pretend to have the reading comprehension of a toddler because I don't like what you are saying."
---
Perhaps reading reddit comments doesn't fuel your narcissism too well. You may *think* that the game needs to be designed to cater to your own interests, but they didn't make GW2 just for you.
---
I'm one of the oddballs that hasn't picked up another game since I started playing Guild Wars 2 three years ago
---
There's just so much to do!
---
Nope, they made it for a large group of people. Build diversity and many different ways to play benefits the idea of having lots of people playing the same game and enjoying it. Sorry that that's lost on you.
---
You know.... I KNEW someone was going to correct me on that. 79 and a free shard.
---
Or geocities. 
---
That is fantastic and I love it &lt;3

2. Damage - Gs2/sword3

Spellbreaker with this setup seems appropriate for you.
---
I'd love to explore the Unending Ocean one day whether as a true underwater experience or, if that's not feasible, as an area affected by magic where we actually can walk on seafloor or where the water may part to reveal dry ground like the Red Sea did during the Exodus.
---
Witnessing the mighty Tethyos Houses of the largos, the abandoned krait settlements with their enigmatic obelisks, the fallen southern quaggan kingdom showing the glory that once was, or exploring destroyed karka hives overcome by Bubbles's corruption and maybe coming face to face with a terrifying [leviathan](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Leviathan) or [kraken](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kraken) would be interesting indeed, and I can only imagine what wonders the great artists at ArenaNet could conjure for these locations given the beauty and terror we've witnessed in core game and the expansions so far. :)
---
Not if youre light like a bunny :)
---
No, underwater combat sucks.
---
The first precursor is always the biggest part, just because it's so horribly expensive in the ascended mats department. Once you're done with the second collection, the rest of the way is just smooth sailing and fun collections.
---
&gt; Had they done it like Silverwastes shovels, it would have been extremely fun feature, we may have even seen trains. But they didn't.
---
That would be better for solo but the current approach is probably better for a group although this is assuming there is no cooldown on each location.
---
If you gather 50 people at one of the clusters of 10 someone should get one nearby each round of using the kit. Then you could theoretically open a lot of chests very quickly. Just waiting for someone to test the theory. 
---
Wow cool!! So much progress, congrats!
---
I have been slowly gathering materials for the Zap Experiment, finally finished the last episode (right on time for the new one tomorrow!), been working on the Mark V Golem backpiece (on the time-gate part now) and finished the 32-slot Olmakhan bag achievement.
---
I'm moving kinda quickly through the small quests I wanna do and soon will need to grind some gold for the griphon, to finish Bolt (first legendary, so excited) and to get my first ascended armor set 🤘🏼
---
(feels so nice sharing these small details 😃)
---
good luck everyone! 
---
That Bart is what horror itself is made of.
---
I usually do it at reset so even when it screws up and runs around it still takes less than 2minutes.
---
I have tried to organize chest farms. Do you have any idea it is to just organize 3 people to do it?
---
You need 50+ people all in VoIP, able to immediately call whether next chest is adjacent to current. And it needs to do it with speed.
---
I have tried to do it with LFG. They act like they are slow. Some of them get overwhelmed and leave the party because they have no clue what's going on no matter how I try to explain it.
---
Weird flex, but ok.
---
No. I hate the underwater mechanics. Not unless we get a sexy underwater mount....fuck I'm excited now
---
Thanks for sharing! It never ceases to amaze me how GuildMag keeps improving with each issue, pushing the envelope with their quality content, layout and the love and dedication of all the content creators and editors who have contributed to the experience. It's heartwarming to hear that they managed to raise so much money for the chosen charity, so kudos to everyone involved!
---
I'll prepare a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy the magazine at my leisure. :)
---
I followed the saga from the beginning I know what she said, none of that is referring to the player base in general.
---
That would be easy for gold sellers.  You need suggestions to account for them or you ruin the game for the rest of us.
---
Feast upon my knickerbockers.
---
I remember this and it makes me miss old LA.
---
If it had that sudden water propulsion while in combat , aquatic mount and maybe more movement easiness while in combat...then yes!
---
My personal favorite old LA vid is a bunch of charr jumping off a diving spot with Lion King music:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj5PwJX7EIk
---
I doubt it. Given that so many people have the weapon already, this may be a move to..don't know...draw in more players?  
---
Yeah.. no. 
---
May be.. But I can confirm that bullshitting very rarely happens if any on the wiki.
---
While the skimmer is handy for surface water, we NEED an ***under***water mount. Anet, I'd pay $10 for a QoL underwater mount in a heartbeat, just saying. 
---
Yeah I have a human guard too--- I've thought the same on occasion but not as much, but yes  also a very good point.
---
Yes, mostly agree.
---
Savior...
---
The wiki is maintained by players. It is easy as hell to just go in and make up whatever nonsense you wish and post there. 
---
The first one is just refering to deroir (and everyone asking her stuff "wouldn't it be a good idea to ...?"). The marked part says she doesn't like the GW2 community reaction to her posts and that she doesn't want to pretend to like GW2 players which are reacting to her comments. She wants to stay in her own echochamber and everyone who "slightly disagrees" is a rando asshat.
---
Her handfull of trolls and nazis refers to the whole reddit community. She just caused the biggest reddit (and media coverage) for GW2 since...ever? It was probably the biggest news coverage GW2 ever had (well...maybe GW2s release in 2012 was able to compete, HoT and PoF definitely not).
---
Nah. Meta reward will probably be a corsair armor piece as usual, likely the leggings. 
---
Cool.
---
Implying Engis are playing anything but Power Holo these days.
---
If the ticket cost reflects the local loot drop from mobs, I'm not afraid
---
IT. IS. NOT. THE. RIGHT. VOICE. EMPHASIS. ON. THE. RIGHT. VOICE.
---
GAME IS AMAZING BUT YES-------- ERROR WILL ROBINSON.
---
It's obviously just something temporarily they used on the alpha server, probably because they didn't have the right icon for the reward yet...or because they didn't want to reveal the reward to anyone.
---
It doesnt need a massive overhaul, it needs to be scrapped completely and be done again from square one. And to be honest, there is a lot of content I'd rather see anet work on instead of underwater revamp (raids, living world, pvp, wvw, fractals, game engine, expansion, etc...).
---
Sorry, was reading that as the NORN.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing the virtues changed to be more akin to warrior stances from WoW.
---
In that you can only have one active at a time, they however grant a stronger effect and grant a effect when swapped.
---
When I did it I played on my engineer. There's a skill on his rifle that does a sort of jump you can aim. It helped on jumps I struggled with.
---
It is bullshit because nobody knows how many achievements are needed for the meta unless Anet did this I'm not saying the wiki is bullshit lots of people put true stuff on their. You need to remember anyone can edit or add things to the wiki pages like I saw something that said a PoF character was in Heart of Thorns.
---
that was a legit report
---
Are you forgetting Jokos staff from episode 4 that isn't Corsair I expect the meta reward to be one of the new weapons from the weapon set to start players on that.
---
I could see islands, ships, and some underwater.  Solid no to a full underwater expansion, though.
---
lol, that's wiki. you can type anything there.
---
Lol I'm a summer child indeed than.  
---
Bullshitting wins.
---
Well if they could do it with anything else why specifically did they use power chrono? How good you are matters, but composition matters too. 
---
Could it be done faster if they used all Dragonhunters instead of Chronos? Was there a specific reason for picking *five* Power Chronos? I am not saying it is because of Power Chrono DPS, but I also think people are going too far in saying the *five power chronos* don't matter at all. 
---
its not that hard but it's right, some other class just need few buttons to get close to some ele dps and since few patch, even getting above (depending on the build obviously). 
---
About stuff you drop, some people consider that selling them in trading post is worth the money but I don't, considering the effort to put these drops in tp. Up to you if you want to see gold increasing slowing but noticeable eveyday, or if you wanna sell them as a stack later ?
---
About gear, you should not focus until max level (80), equip what you got that looks nice to you stats wise or even skinwise.
---
I just want to know if it's worth to press so many keys. If I will be more OP, bcz I need more skill it's ok. But if really all classes are balanced, it's not worth to play that class.
---
&gt; why need i to press like 30 keys to kill someone, if they can press 10 and kill me pretty easily.
---
Because you like the difficulty of playing elementalist? You said it yourself.
---
ele is still by far  the best dps in the game later in group content (with weaver elite speck). tho generally as a new player you normally better of as either deadeye, daredevil or mirage, since they have a more forgiving rotation and comparable dps
---

She was doing sexist attacks, of course such person cannot stay...not in this time an america.... /shrug
---
In what world is 
---
&gt; it needs to be scrapped completely and be done again from square one 
---
not 
---
&gt; a massive overhaul 
---
yeah, ruin the meta for everyone else....
---
Heck yeah, i would love that!
---
Water levels are literally the worst in every single video game I can think of. Gw2 is unfortunately no exception.
---
So because something (I’ve seen many examples lately) was last available in 2014 and MAY one day be available again it’s not on that horribly incomplete list? Right okay then. Guess I’ll buy some lottery tickets while I wait for that to rotate back in. 
---
this is literally the only thing i wanted to post when i saw this so im glad someone else said it
---
I look at Aquaman and I think how amazingly stunning norn men should look like ...
---
I really appreciate that you want to make tempest a better specialization, but many of the suggestions here do not work for various reasons. I'd love to address every single point you raise, but that would take too long.
---
I'll just focus on your suggestions for the minor traits. These traits have always bothered me because it is true that they are a cop out. Speedy conduit is basically an empty trait slot that may as well not even exist. Half of Hardy conduit is an empty trait as well. However, the reason why they are a cop out is not their level of power. Instead it all has to do with the way they are designed. Frankly, your redesign of them makes tempest more powerful, but they are just as much as a cop out as before. Let me explain why.
---
Overloads all have many effects to compensate for what you have to sacrifice in order to cast them. Most of these effects are different, but they all have a stun break baseline. Now imagine if this stunbreak was made part of the minor traits. Would there be a difference? There wouldn't be a difference, because it would still basically be a core part of the overload mechanic since you don't choose your minors. The same way, the swiftness and protection are basically core parts of the overloads that were stripped away to be added as minor traits. This is why tempest basically has an empty minor trait slot. Hardy conduit is not an empty trait slot because it makes protection on the tempest stronger. This is different because tempest is not your only source of protection. Allies can give it to you, and you can get it yourself with various ways. Primarily through the earth and arcane trait lines, so there is synergy with previous core ele traits and skills. 
---
What you are doing with the minors is taking both of the boons that should have been baseline to overloads and moving them into one minor trait. In addition, you also introduce an aura transmute to all of the skills that provide auras. The second part sounds great until you realize that only shouts + sand squall would be affected, and that there would be no difference if the devs just added transmutes baseline to the shouts + sand squall. Basically, you still have a minor trait effect that exclusively works with tempest, and has no synergy with anything else you could take. This would have been different if there were more skills that gave auras. Like if for example signet auras were not removed before tempest became a thing, because then you could convert those into transmutes if you invested into tempest. However, as it is now making shout transmutes part of a minor trait is pointless.
---
Again, you shouldn't attempt to engage in conversation with someone if you aren't prepared for the possible outcome of them not agreeing with you. If anything my reply to you had far more substance than your comment which essentially gave no reasoning for dgh longbow being buffed other than "wanting build diversity." There already is build diversity so that's not a substantial argument to justify buffing it to the point of it being better than scepter. I told you many different points and you're all [la-dee-da-dee-da can't hear you](https://i.imgur.com/7niktYV.jpg) which pretty much sums it up from my reply to you from a few days ago, it's immature af.
---
To be fair, most PUGs still expect a chronomancer to tank. Even though, as you've said, firebrand is a perfectly solid option for most bosses.
---
Amazing amount of effort has gone into this. Great work. 
---
Thief’s are op in PvP? Are you sure about that? 
---
I manually maxed all of mine aside from my Ele ^o^
---
I’m currently levelling a warrior and a new engi and oh boy... 0-35 is the *worst* because you don’t have exp dungeon access! After that, it’s not so painful. 
---
I found and charged it last week while doing the collection for Mawdrey. Carefully read the wiki for its possible locations. I found it in the earth room in one of the bushes. You also may be able to simply do the fire elemental boss and hope someone else charged it because i got credit for the achievement by simply fighting the steam golem.
---
To echo what other people have been saying, I think you were just very unlucky with the dungeons.
---
"A few quick levels" ideas: 
---
* Complete the 6 city maps. Easy enough and worth about three or four levels in total off the top of my head. 
---
* Craft! Crafting a skill to 500 takes you up about seven levels. You probably won't have the materials to do it all, but it's a good boost either way. 
---
* PvP! It might be worth starting a new character for this: guardian and warrior are both pretty strong with an easy point of entry. You're scaled to the same level and all skills are unlocked. One of the common rewards for 5v5 PvP is a tome that boosts you up a whole level. Core mesmer is great in PvE but underwhelming in PvP unless you can keep 3 clones up to bewilder players so powering through with a guardian with a greatsword might be easier. In unranked matches, expect to win 50% and lose 50%. Experience boosters often speed up PvP rewards, which can be useful.
---
* World boss trains: be prepared to travel for this until you've got the waypoints unlocked, but they're decently rewarding huuuuge group events. They don't run all day every day, but when a group gets together it will be epic. Check the LFG now and again and hop in on one when you can. 
---
If you're on EU send me a PM. I'm usually happy for a dungeon crawl and they are good fun and rewarding as you level. 
---
It does not help, that a lot of people think being good at raids gives them a pass to leave their manners and respect for others behind. Considering the 'difficulty' of GW2 raids on average... 
---
In our world. Let me help you see my point of view :
---
You buy a plot of land with a little house in the middle of it. You bulldoze the house, remove whatever foundation it might have had, and build a new house where the previous used to stand.
---
You can't say you "overhauled" the house. You scrapped it and put something new in its place.
---
Don't forget to do your dailies: easy 2 gold. It's honestly worth doing them and buying some good-enough exotics off the TP. 
---
&gt;Gaming companies are throwing their devs to the wolves
---
That's not always the case though. It's mostly some of the devs becoming asshats by themselves when they start to speak as part of the company. 
---
For example, a month later after that Daniel Z. Klein got fired from Riot Games for speaking up in almost the same behavior when the whole PAX drama around "No males included" panel started. It was known for years that he was behaving like a manchild when people were pointing some design and gameplay issues in champions he made (Taliyah and Kayn), but the whole issue on PAX was over the board.
---
In the end, it's all up to company to keep it under control, either would it be keeping the devs silent and dispose of the asshats that cause the outrage, or finding proper community managers/PR-people.
---
This is not my friend. This is my god.
---
Buy this before: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder
---
It will save your sanity.
---
it doesnt need to be scrapped at all. the underwater combat is great and pretty much better than 99% of all the games that does underwater combat.
---
it just shouldnt be made its own full expansion because underwater combat at no point ever, is fun.
---
What, random 16k hits kill people ? Who would have guessed.
---
We also said "No" to mounts too.
---
Or getting headshot out of the sky while gliding by Axemaster Gwyllion. I’m still getting PTSD whenever there’s a target above my toon’s head xD
---
Only if you are a female streamer who thinks screaming like a 16 year old girl who gets drunk the first time is cool
---
[The current patch's benchmarks.](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) The high skill ceiling on Weaver definitely gets rewarded with the highest DPS.
---
The game is pretty balanced, in that most specs are pretty viable when piloted with average skill—and most specs have a high enough skill ceiling to be rewarded for great piloting.
---
reduce character model limit
---
What time does it come out?
---
I'd've liked HoT better if exploration was not gated  behind masteries; thank you, ANet, for not doing this in PoF (or at least, gating it behind mount masteries was better). I much preferred PoF, while I haven't even completed HoT. 
---
I have not liked some of the living story stuff this season as much because of some of the challenges, specifically 'the floor is lava/lines' type stuff is rough on me because I'm legally blind. I've done them, but man were they frustrating. I imagine for a fully-sighted person they might be fun, though.
---
They should do it, it would bad ass and make sense given the themes so far jungle dessert ect 
---
First of all you're not going to be pressing 30 keys. 20 of those skills are tied to a total of 5 buttons. You just have more cooldowns to manage, that's all. More options.
---
Could you explain a bit more? I am bit out of touch with meta team comps.
---
DH is too high as well - not to mention DE - but you don't see either of them making up 70% of the squad. Mesmer must be either mandatory support or a mandatory dps. Not both.
---
There are few problems with underwater combat:
---
1. Most underwater combat is done in closed areas, thus we have a lot of camera problems since we cannot really predict ow players will keep their camera
---
2. AoE makes no sense underwater and many skills widely used are not available due to them using AoE targeting. For example chronomancer is completely gutted, unable to use wells. 
---
3. Game wasn't really made with intention that players will be attacked from all directions - any skill that does something after blocking will throw big damage in front of player character instead of towards enemy that attacked him in the first place (as an example). 
---
4. Addition our controls allow us to comfortably attack only enemies on the same level or lower, making us seen highest place during fight. This brings most problems with camera etc. Also bosses will follow players up there ans start clipping... 
---
No such thing as useless experience 
---
Still counts tho, right? ;)
---
There is, experience where your learn things wrong. I won't take medicine lessons from anti-vaxxers.
---
I don't even raid and I'm like "Wow, what's your problem?"
---
I like your style, aside from that shitty helm. I get the idea, but headpieces in gw2 are so sad. I usually use small stuff like crowns or something 
---
Thank God! A female human without their ankles showing!
---
Old LA best LA
---
It is more that she was acting like a huge douchebag, trying to cover it with sexism.
---
It will not lock later once it's unlocked.
---
yeah it did :) 
---
Karma whoring? *On Reddit?!* Surely you jest! Such a thing is **utterly unthinkable**!
---
I kinda like it, it reminds me of Gondorian helmet.  But yeah there's not a lot of choices for real helmets with light classes.
---
Everybody wants an underwater expansion. I want an Island expansion with underwater elements. A city under water, cool, but the pact bases on the islands and with Bubble minions constantly coming out to attack while the pact desperately tries to figure out how to attack the Deep Dude from their disadvantageous position. Maybe an Island even gets blown up at one point.
---
Ok I'll give that a try, thanks!
---
I think an underwater expansion would still have more land-based content than underwater content ( caves, air-bubbles, secret inquest labs at the ocean floor, islands(!!!), ships, huge krait constructs, big pact submarines to run around in) and would need more than a little overhaul to underwater combat (a new underwater weapon type for more build diversity) but I can actually see them pulling it off.
---
Thanks for your answer!

You think overclocking the CPU would is worth it?

---
Is it possible to not be lvl 2 when you leave? I'm an altoholic and assumed it automatically boosted you to 2 no matter what. 
---
Thanks!  The plus side is I only work 3 days a week, and I'm off Tuesday so I'll be around for the Living World release!  Nothing wrong with not having a single main, Anet gives us options for a reason.  
---
Overclocking the ryzen doesn't do much for gaming from what I've heard. I have about the same specs as you (except for 1080ti instead of 1080, doesn't make a difference for GW2 tho) and I get good performance turning shaders and model limit all the way down. Also try to play around with reflexions, that can also cause frame drops.
---
I already saw this thread yesterday and totally forgot that I have a toon that literally matches my mini.

Leaker here, can confirm you ask Rytlock out at the beginning of the episode. He says yes and both of you have a date in lion's arch while your teammates stalks you from a distance.
---
This is exactly what I've been thinking has been coming for a while. Just because Steve is the undewater dragon doesnt mean the expansion has to be 100% in the actual water. there'd be loads to do with regular movement areas, just under the sea, or on the coast (of cantha hopefully).

So, just play sword Weaver and renegade. Don’t get the problem here. You got outdps‘d by a thief? Happens. By a DH after his burst? Get good.  
---
Soulbeast? Never had one in group + it isn’t meta in raids (fracs on certain comps)
---
underwater content is all nice and cozy till combat kicks in.
---
they released that as revolutionary. it really wasn't and doesn't do any justice to the rest of the gw2 combat system.
---
i mean what if we get a whole mastrry line tgat improved out ability to fight in Water 
---
like it gives us a special Action key that lets ja fight Underwater with our regular Skills 
---
and our characters behave like low Gravity 
---
this being the last Level tho or second
---
first would be something like Iron Boots means no Land weapon yet but get low Gravity Combat 
---
id Love this
---
Thanks!
---
I agree with you that the stat spreads on condition gear are likely too efficient. But if you want to play pure condition builds there just isn't a viable alternative to stats like Shaman/Apothecary and specifically Dire and Trailblazer, which a lot of people have an issue with. 
---
Even at 3.1K armor and 20K HP i can easily get hit for 10k by power builds using at least 1/3rd marauder gear, or 15k by full berserker. This while it takes me 5-10 seconds to stack conditions that deal the same damage but then get cleansed before they deal even half of that. If you don't have evades/teleports/blocks etc. you are very reliant on being tanky. I would like to use Renegade's Shortbow for example, but without Staff's block &amp; evade i'm just a punching bag. :/
---
The power Renegade build i use (to compare) has about 2.7k armor and 20k HP and doesn't take that much more damage with ~400 less armor. It also deals damage way more reliably than my condition build. Most of my conditions that actually land come from either unblockable skills like Frigid Blitz/Banish Enchantment/Embrace The Darkness, or hydromancy sigil  + abyssal chill procs when i weapon swap. It takes time or enemy negligence (Such as standing in AoE or getting hit by really obvious Axe 5's.) to really stack up decent damage.
---
Other factors include the amount of cleanse available to players going up dramatically. (Prime example being Sigil of Cleansing from 1&gt;3 cleanse.) I feel like all these changes are slowly pushing condition builds out of the game entirely.
---
I do disagree that it's impossible to make a high sustain build using power damage. Besides my own Renegade build I've seen some pretty high sustain warrior/spellbreaker, firebrand, holo, and soulbeast roamers for example. The amount of boons people can stack these days (especially protection, but that's more of a hassle for power builds obviously.) also doesn't help.
---
It wouldn't bother me that much if stat combos like Dire/Trailblazer or even my own Shaman/Apothecary got their effectiveness decreased. But you would have to compensate condition builds to remain viable. And that would likely lead to them getting more bursty condition damage. At that point i feel they would basically become power builds, but with a different name.
---
It's a very difficult balancing issue honestly, i know how annoying condition builds can be. Pre-HoT was pretty condi heavy, i remember hating necromancers with a passion before HoT :P
---
 
---
You can get the Amulet by doing the achievments of the 2. act of PoF. The rest you have to trade as the other people mentioned here.
---
Knowing gw2 players someone would have ressed you by now
---
Thanks for sharing, will give it a try!
---
Good point, perhaps with something like the [orange hue infusion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Polyluminescent_Undulating_Infusion_(Orange))? I guess that might mess up the outfit.
---
Yep. Had a pure dps team of power shiro herald, 2 condi mirage, scourge and reaper, I thought for sure we were gonna get rolled since we had no support/sustain. Instead won by about 400 points. Goes to show that the matchmaking is borked and glass classes hold all the cards. 
---
oh... and where I was all happy with it. But I guess Rome doesnt appear in one day, did it? 
---
Plenty to improve, as long as I keep trying... I will arrive there.
---
Thz for the hints :)
---
If we cant get a spider mount then we shouldnt get an underwater expansion.
---
Thank you soo much! 
---
Really apreciate. 
---
That would be excellent, even if it was played as a track, rather than in game. I think Fear Not This Night is one of the best game songs ever. I'd love to hear Caith sing about being tempted by the nightmare and rising above it.
---
Hi, I’m a returning player who played a warrior before. I’ve been wanting to come back and start either an engineer or a thief, and don’t know which to pick. I like both pretty equally, but am a little turned off by how hard people say engineer is, and the high skill cap it takes to play thief in PVP (I like to do PvX). Could I get some recommendations or advice?
---
Would have been funnier if we caught her messing around in Snowball Mayhem on the opposite team.
---
Hi
---
So first of all the boss is called Sloth :P
---
About the Dps and what to expect for the future from pugs:
---
I can tell you from my experience in experienced pugs the dps players in 150+ LIs squads do around 20k DPS on bosses like sloth. 
---
At 250+ LIs the people are often really good at their rotations, for example i was doing xera yesterday and nobody was under 31k DPS on Power builds. 
---
For the beginning 10k are enough to kill most bosses i think. 
---
About classes i think the best power dps classes atm are weaver, holosmith, Deadeye and dh (for some bosses). Condi wise its Mirage, Renegade and Scourge for Epi bouncing. 
---
Welcome to raiding and have fun with the other bosses! 
---
Renegade heal build scales worse with power when compared to firebrand, i.e., firebrand with harriers pulls 13k or something, firebrand with minstrels pulls like 3k so it’s a huge dps loss for a firebrand, while ren goes from like 5k to 4K or something. Also, it helps if renegade can be the one to move the boss around, since a large part of its support(actually all of it) relies on aoe placement and sudden movements could throw off alacrity uptime or heals
---
There are generally 5 roles in raid
---
1. Power DPS
---
2. Condi DPS
---
3. Healer + boon support. Most common class would be druid, but other builds are possible.
---
4. Tank (sometimes) + Boon support. Most common class would be chrono, but other builds are possible... maybe.
---
5. Banner warrior (or berserker)
---
So you mention you have power and condi DPS, you may want to expand to roles 3, 4 or 5.
---
You can refer to [snowcrows.com](https://snowcrows.com) for possible builds. 
---
As what others mention, viper reaper isn't really great as a condi DPS class. You could try condi scourge, if you still would like to play necro.
---
Not with the current strats. Currently groups ignore one of the pyres and just dps through him having permanent stab. But for pchrono this significantly reduces its dps, since Disenchanter does way less damage if the target has a boon.
---
In order to test pchrono properly on qadim, you'd have to go back to the earlier strat of having several spellbreakers as well to deny Qadim from getting boons. Just boonstripping wouldn't be enough since the boons are reapplied constantly. Denial would be the only way.
---
Actually, yes, they might be able to do it faster with DH. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/524638373999280138/531573992029421578/Screenshot_2019-01-06-12-44-55-1.png
---
Its even funnier from a sylvaris perspective.
---
Caithe is basically your older sister....
---
Come on sis!

---
It’s pretty hard to get though lol
---
If you run BlishUI under Wine as well, then it should just work (I can test if you like, but my linux install hasn't been patched in months).
---
Running BlishUI on linux is where things get tricky. Wine does of course use linux APIs to implement OpenFileMappingW/MapViewOfFile, but it has to do some kind of name mangling, because "MumbleLink" is not a proper linux path for shm_open(). I tried tracking it down through the wine source code, and it appears that wineserver keeps a mapping between those names and anonymous fd's. Wineserver does not expose a stable API across versions, so I don't believe you can get access without patching wine (and requiring everyone to run that one wine version).
---
&gt; I'm going to spin up a Ubuntu VM tonight and push a build to it and see if I can get it to communicate with MumbleLink in GW2 at all.
---
I don't think you'll have much success with GW2 on a VM with no GPU acceleration. Even if mesa's software renderer supports all the required opengl extensions, it'll be a slideshow.
---
How far did you reduce character count? That is pretty much responsible for all your issues. If I were you, put Character Count to minimum, and their quality to one above minimum. 
---
If you're still having issues, try reducing shadows. 
---
If after all that you still got issues, try using the FPS Limiter. Having a buttery smooth 60 or 30 FPS is better than one that jumps from 100 to 75. I have a less than stellar PC, so I use the 30 FPS limit... It takes a moment to get used to, but since it's not a first person shooter, the FPS limit is no longer noticeable. 
---
I use the guildhall as my player house.
---
Yeah, this is a ton of fun! I've been roaming around some maps just looking out for events and there are so many I've never seen before. 
---
Also running around talking to every NPC I could possibly talk to. So much cool stuff, like the Olmakhan charr who set up a memorial for his adventuring party, and is visited by their ghosts. 
---
&gt; I did notice when I skipped ahead to get my raptor that mission was a little harder than usual lol 
---
O dear, sweet child... The pocket raptor welcoming committee looks forward to your arrival.  
---
If you can OC cpu - do it, it helps. 
---
Set Reflections to Terrain and Sky. 
---
Set Character Model Limit to Low. 
---
Turn off the shadows, it has big impact on FPS. Or at least don't use them on Ultra. 
---
These are the most important settings, which may cause FPS drops. BTW, in Lion's Arch u will allways have some drops. 
---
Nice progress, commander!
---
Personally, I jsut lost two days of dailies because I was playing Factorio instead, and when I was ready to login on background to grab them, I found out it is already 1:03 after reset :D
---
Otherwise I am one Dragon Stand run from Hope IV collection finalized :)
---
Let’s not. 
---
A lot of the cosmetics are in the cash shop 
---
I would buy this.
---
You mean that the fb+rene+slb+war+dps comp (cus you know - spirits) is easier to find than chrono+druid+war+2dps?
---
If you are looking for either and not a specific comp, than the search space is still wider. My point is it's easier to find 1 working comp of either than just looking for Chrono + Druid specifically.
---
Ok firstly, how the hell did u manage this with LIGHT armour. Secondly the armour is actually pretty realistic and functional looking (but ur right, the plate armour should be covering the boobs, otherwise it would be useless). I’m sure you’ve tried doing this with heavy and medium though right? Cause there are some sweet armour sets in there that I love! Agree that helmets look ridiculous though!
---
P.S. Final note, I don’t actually care if my female/male character’s are exposed because it works in some cases and looks cool (specially on Norn). Fantasy game after all :)
---
I mean using that logic you can also include a 4 necro + druid comp
---
This is what entitlement looks like.
---
asking for more paid content is what a whale looks like 
---
yeah I cant appreciate the gameplay much because WvW never clicked for me, but his editing is pretty good.
---
Thinking a company can survive off the 60 dollars you gave them 6 years ago.
---
I never said it can't be fun. I said you need to get accustomed to GW2. You also said "once you get used to". How are you disagreeing then?
---
I'm more than willing to pay them. I just want to pay them for something new.
---
It's not entitlement. That content was already there, later then removed it. I see no reason to but the same thing again.
---
Probably you can expect it as always, at tuesday 18:00 of EU time. It would be huge exception, if patch was rolled on other time.
---
NASA found life on Mars?! :O
---
Seriously though not a fan of these shinnies...
---
No, it's thinking a company has the right to charge twice for old content they themselves removed from the game, then (hypothetically, according to OP's idea) put it back in as a novelty.
---
If Anet wants me to pay for new content, I'm all ears. But old LA isn't worth my money. 
---
You're just full of bad ideas aren't you?
---
i stan
---
Fantasy game or not, on a roleplaying side you'll get fucked hard for any exposed area.
---
EotM doesn’t give XP nor daily credit any more. That entire map is completely dead.
---
Kinda sad, even at max level I liked just running with a karma train for some relaxing play.
---
I know exactly what you mean, but I kinda giggled when you said Anet was "far, far slower" when Shaman exists in WoW lol. That class has been moaned about for almost as long as Guild Wars 2 has existed, and most recently they basically just bandage slapped some number buffs instead of actually addressing complaints xD
---
Some people are just truly desperated..
---
The good ol'times, I miss it. 
---
Wow, I wish they released this a year earlier. 
---
The first episode is every newbie's first AC P3 experience until the level 80 arrives :P
---
If you don't dismount you lose money in the casino. Trust me ;) 
---
Very well said (also old wow player)
---
but ... why ? 
---
i mean a gen1.0 armor crafted twice would cost less than a single astralaria
---
Turn it into a guild hall. The un-upgraded version is already designed as well - destroyed LA
---
They probably blasted themselves some stealth if you know what I mean
---
A good dungeon routine for this is Twilight Arbor up + foward, Cof all three paths and CoE all three paths.
---
I think it would be better for it to be a claimable Guild Hall, and the event starts at Fractal Portal.
---
The mission would be something like reclaiming the Guild Hall as a Fractal from instabilities. 
---
Anet just make season 1 live again. Then we get old LA temporarily back AND get to play the story. (befor that polish it pls, and make Hologramfight a temp Raid :P)
---
Thank you
---
I mained a thief from 2012 to now and I haven't gotten bored. Initially I played it like a warrior and found it really hard, but as soon as you get into that mindset of 'dodge to strike another day' (which is true of all proffs really) then it clicked. I love Daredevil the most, purely for the movement skills. I have a character for every base profession, but thief is the one I complete the story on.
---
If you have the money. You can Soulbind Twilight or Sunrise,  then when you combine them in the forge, the version the Eternity that's made hasn't been bound. So you could sell it then fund another twilight and still have profit
---
4. Dead people wp
---
Dead people inside an event area still counts to the scaling of the event difficuilty. When they just stay down, they don't participate but makes it harder for others to finish the event. So be kind and teleport to your nearest waypoint and reengage the event as active player to reduce the time needed for it to finish and make everyone happy :D
---
Cc or break cc or defiance bar or similar
---
Bosses, Champions Gold, Elites and some veteran enemies have a second blue-ish health bar. You can damage this bar with crowd controll skill (eg dazes,  stuns, knockback and some conditions like wealness, cripple, slow, blind or taunt). When its depleted, the enemy is stunned and has a debuff for a short duration, which boosts your damage against them Use it!
---
My advice is to slow dps. Since his break bar is at set HP%, make sure your CCs are ready by slowing down. Also, make sure people are actually taking CC, not just auto attacking.
---
I believe a while back people were somehow cheating so this mail was directed to them. But somehow at one point the systems got disconnected and everyone got this
---
Get your level 2 alt to 80 doing the Octovine meta. Using an Exalted armor, even at level 2 you have 100% hit chance on the mobs and gate/vine. However you're still taking additional damage from mobs based on level difference, so even your 50k HP will get oneshot by a random sniper or frog, so time to play tag ball.
---
Had about 5000 watching the raid tournament and this would be considered a niche community too
---
i mean, who in their right mind still watches DC movies at this point
---
This needs gold. 
---
no, especially if the new elite specs are underwater only since underwater content in this game is very rare and meaningless
---
I think they meant "realistically speaking". Fantasy can still have realism in it after all, else you'd see fantasy knights run around in their briches as well instead of heavy plate armor.
---
&gt; AoE makes no sense underwater and many skills widely used are not available due to them using AoE targeting. For example chronomancer is completely gutted, unable to use wells.
---
To be fair, this may just be an oversight, or an issue that takes more time to work on (given how long it took to do the recent underwater balance pass.
---
If they figure out the best way to work out how to cast ally-based AoE underwater (first thing I'd try is just casting the skill in an AoE around yourself), then I think Chrono wells would work similarly to how Necro AoE works underwater.
---
I thought ArcDPS only steals your credit card info.
---
You'd be amazed at the history of putting more items in the crafting materials also the account keyring/wallet
---
I agree completely.
---
Bug in the system 
---
Yes Logitech C920 seems to be the most popular camera, streamer or not.  And it's affordable.
---
Great jungle wurm is a 1-15 zone and anyone can do it.  Daily shiverpeakes vista viewer is easy. Just ignore the dailies if you don't understand them until you learn.
---
Or, if you're on a US server, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I teach the game to a lot of people.
---
There's no way to change the dailies you have access to.
---
Yea, don't follow advise of lazy people, if you just want to experience and explore the game on your own. 
---
There is 0 benefit from that mount in your case. Source: Currently leveling an alt without a mount.
---
All you can do now, is relog on your 80 for those dailies, or skip them for now. You loose nothing in the long run.
---
You chose to have a level 80 character, so the game treats you as having access to the full game. Even you would've leveled the regular way, the dailies would appear too, but mostly for things that are in your level range, but not exclusive to the areas you visited. For example, the Great Jungle Wurm is a world boss that is in the Sylvari starter area, which is level 1-15, so you would have gotten that daily, same as the Shiverpeaks Vista viewer (Shiverpeaks are the whole of the snowy norn areas, including the starter zone and their city)
---
But everything else, yeah you did this to yourself, and would have to ignore many of the dailies.
---
It's just dailies, you get stuff from them. Once you explore the huge maps, you'll be able to waypoint and knock them out quickly.
---
&gt; "Great Jungle Wurm", "Daily Shiverpeaks Vista Viewer"... 
---
Not PoF related at all
---
Nope, works quite fine. Have you looked into your combat log? Should show up there on the first crit.
---
Thats mostly because they want to fc the wing rather than just escort. Otherwise they have to wait after escort for a new player
---
Underwater content has never been a good hit in any MMO, mostly because it puts the player in an uncomfortable position. Besides being clunky most of the time,  being underwater requires the player to move in several new directions, which to makes moving more of a chore in the long term.   
---
However, i think the biggest problem about underwater content is not being able to jump, the one thing every MMO player loves to do all the time.
---
For a couple of months it was bugged so that not nearly as many champions would spawn, but they recently fixed that so it's again the farming place to go to.
---
Ah I see what u mean by that now. In realistic setting then. Well I’m glad they give the player a choice in GW2. Although, I would say light armour has always been a weak point for FW2
---
Well...actually, that’s the point. Anyone can do that in GW2. Hence why u can transmute any armour. Fantasy implies exactly what u said :)
---
I'v played both WoW and GW2 since they released. I enjoy them for different reasons as they are not the same experience and don't substitute for one another. However, I also playing more GW2 because of the non-rng and community game play rather than the watered down Blizzard experience. If you want to play some let me know! 
---
I have suggested for a year or so that scrapper's GM trait "applied force" be changed so that instead of granting quickness to just the scrapper it do it in AOE.
---
After that all we need is another spec or 2 that can do alacrity and the meta would be rather flexible.
---
I went through the pain and suffering that was vazj'shir to know it was a bad idea, I went through the pain of HotW to know it was a bad idea.
---
My favorite way to level is thru tomes. So I can be level 80 in under 5mins.
---
Lol.
---
No.
---
What?
---
In the beta you got dismounted. In release, there's an NPC nearby that tells you that you shouldn't be mounted, but you're the Commander so who's going to stop you?
---
would be "fun" to have different armor score per body part depending on armor skin :)
---
&gt; Of all possible replies the big burly charr could have delivered, the best he could do was "NO U".
---
Not everyone is the master of burns: [Azalus Poisontongue](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Azalus_Poisontongue)
---
Basically. You can technically get slightly more profit if you can and know how to get the maximum amount of Magic Find on yourself, but it sounds like you haven't maxed yours yet, plus it's a pain. Selling directly is the way to go.
---
If anything, add it to scrapper, but definitly not to base engi or holo, because holo is pretty OP anyways in the current balance..
---
Yep youre right; you can easily take a thief or power chrono which do the same skips. But at that point you will have 5 fixed roles and you will never find that in pugs.
---
But yes, id love to see more fb/ren in general, but i doubt pugs want to adjust (me included)
---
Main Engineer here. It's not that hard of a class to play if your not worried about squeezing every amount of DPS out of it. You also have some nice utility also for different situations. Such as one of the best classes for tagging mobs (flame thrower), kiting and staying the hell back (rifle). And with Holo you can go all in melee if that's your thing. What makes them "hard" is needing to play the piano along with lots of manual aiming in order to max DPS. Of course all classes need rotations, but things like manually aiming grenades can get old. 
---
I also have a Thief but ended up going Dead Eye as I already have some DPS melee characters. They are fun classes to roam with though. As Chm said, make both. You can also run them up a bit level wise to get some idea on their play styles.  Then stick with the one you feel most comfortable with. 
---
As far as PVP / WvW viability I am not so sure as I only play PvE content. 
---
it's all based upon facts, if they are still cheating in wvw, botting in pvp then clearly they are not banned. the dishonour stuff was big news on this sub a while back, so that's not even debatable. all you're doing is playing devils advocate
---
Assuming open world or fractals as you haven't specified... Grab an axe and sceptre and see which one you prefer. Nothing wrong with weapon swapping and carrying both. 
---
Axe mirages suffer from a lack of range and axe 2 sends you flying forward pretty far, which is risky near ledges, so the sceptre might help make up for that. 
---
Danmmit reddit, you had one job, get back here and hug the right site!
---
The 5 racial capitals and Lion's Arch.
---
That would be interesting! :D
---
Anet: Let's put a clever meme reference in our game.  
---
Dev: Say no more  
---
Anet: This isn't.. you know what, keep it. It's fine.   
---
Don't mind the guys acting like you've made a huge mistake boosting to lvl80. They're just dailies which usually just give ~2 gold and some other minor stuff. They're great to do obviously, but they are in no way required to do.
---
Most of the playerbase usually forget to do them. In a lot of times I'm not bothered in doing them (don't feel like running around in the world or doing pvp). Either way the mount is definitely the best quality of life improvements in the game. Just take your time and play at a comfortable pace. 
---
It's ok, he/she is just taking this opportunity to let me know what a lazy noob I am ;-)  Thanks!
---
Ah ok, thanks for the help!
---
Nobody forces you to buy VIP pass neither any other items in the gem shop. VIP pass doesn't provide you anything but convenient way of using NPC services; neither of available currently passes has any additional content it would be worth crying over not having access to. Moreover, OP post is a suggestion and if it would be implemented, it would aim at those who miss old pirate style Lion's Arch and those who like having VIP areas which clearly means not for you.
---
So, what's your problem? Having an argument for the sake of argument and chance of spilling venom all around? Grab a bagel and shut up.
---
If you can't buy more than one then it's a collection with different steps.
---
not sure if its a bait or youre actually just stupid
---
If you want to stockpile, do not buy kits but buy the dyes and stockpile them. The gems you use to buy one dye kit can get you multiple exclusive dyes from those dye kits.
---
Note: buying from the tp does NOT unlock that dye so you can stockpile as many as you like for selling later.
---
You can do any 3 of the dailies on your level 80, get the free 2g for doing them and then use the little level up boosts on your lower level character. Now that you have a raptor it will take much less time to travel to the different locations and once you've explored these places you should have waypoints unlocked so you can go back there when the dailies repeat. Having the raptor is awesome and worth it. 
---
Oh shoot it "bark" Simpson! 
---
omg yes this would be amazing 
---
The weapons &amp; armor are part of the same collection, but I feel ya.  
---
If you play PvP and/or WvW I would recommend running the dungeon reward tracks (3 weapons, 1 armor piece &amp; 240 dungeon tokens per track, if you pick 2handed weapons first it goes quick as those are 390 tokens each) 
---
I'm running the ARAH track and it will save me *lots* of frustration in the end... Once I'm done that I will probably switch to TA, as only 2 of those paths are run casually...
---
Thanks.  I don't wanna touch the lvl80 anymore, at least until I get more experience, and I don't want any boosts for the lower character.  Thanks for the input though.
---
&gt; Debt I owe you.
---
 I expected her to be like "I don't owe you shit commander"
---
I agree. I think you lose out on a lot of nuance and detail if you immediately boost and just use the mount as a new player in starter zones. There's less motivation to really explore the design of areas or navigate to some of the vistas that were created with the intent that players explore their way up to them without a mount. If I had started this game back at launch with the raptor mount, I would appreciate this game's world a lot less and probably not be playing 6 years later. 
---
&gt; it doesnt need to be scrapped at all. the underwater combat is great and pretty much better than 99% of all the games that does underwater combat.
---
Most games don't even try to deal with underwater combat, because it's un-fun for the vast majority of players and pretty much always garbo. Even the GW2 underwater combat is just plain bad. The problems are listed above. 
---
Underwater also makes for a pretty fucking limited environment design.
---
It doesnt matter if its a couple of sec only. When sloth gets a breakbar he cleanses all conditions. This means you have to start from scratch again as a condi class making them terrible
---
Set it in the mists, since we don't have a hall set in the mist yet.
---
I managed to get my fourth mist accessory (you know those WvW/PvP/Fractals accessories that can be reset to different stats for any of those game modes currencies) and built first level War Room in a guild me and my SO started for fun (but we are not recruiting new people yet, since our guild hall is just basic starting buildings we could get with just two players). I also managed to gear my condi renegade with some ascended gear (but not full set yet) and I'm working on harrier or minstrel gear for my support firebrand. I also killed a few raid bosses with my main guild (but with each month they do less and less bosses on raid evenings...).
---
Any tips on how to force my allies to stand in my wells as a chronomancer? Ever since SoI rework I have problems with quickness uptime due to my squad moving around and almost never standing in my wells. A few PUG's blamed me for low quickness, so I look for some good tips on this matter. 
---
Yeah, Necro wells and other Aoe skills like Engi grenades already work like that. What makes Chrono wells a little more difficult is that a few of them aren't intended to be cast on enemies. Additionally, there aren't many skills, if any, that are a single target cast on an ally; pretty much all support skills are ground target AoE, or AoE centered around yourself.
---
Granted, it's not like it's an impossible fix or anything but I personally just give a little more leeway in the sense that it's not something they have done previously. If/when they do another underwater balance pass or update, I'd expect them to have figured out a solution and have Chrono wells work underwater.
---
I enjoyed the leveling experience even at launch and in beta without the convenience and quality of life features we have today. I think hearts are really there to just get you to explore a certain area and then events carry you the rest of the way in most cases. Stacking events with heart progress and finishing them both around the same time felt very rewarding in the leveling experience when comparing GW2 leveling to more dated games like WoW. I also think that if you did not play GW1, you're naturally not gonna have any connection to the world, the maps, or the zones and then it will all feel like a chore for the most part.   
---
I have tons of scrolls and tomes to level toons, but I actually find that I enjoy my characters way less when I boost them as, for me, the narrative and also the mechanical connection to the character motivates me to enjoy the character and leveling process as a whole. That's why I will try to level my next toons organically because I enjoy the core content and feel more connected to the character and profession itself. I always found map exploration and personal story to be the most fulfilling way to level as I feel like that's how they intend most players to level up initially. Everything else like crafting is just a short cut for more experienced players in my opinion.
---
And possibly LWS4 Episode 3. It was added back as free with the racing and might also stop beeing free once the new updat drops?!
---
Ewww you use 6 for abilities??
---
QERCV master race
---
I'm planning on bringing her to raids. Thanks for pointing out the difference, I'll try to get used to both :)
---
That is also another fair point. Someone who is used to healing in world top 250 guilds in WoW is in for a bit of a surprise with both general difficulty levels and also how uninvolved healing in GW2 is but instead responses focus on superficial similarities between Paladins and Guardians.
---
If we are going to make a good impression and encourage players over from WoW (which is far, far better at both PvE balance and raiding content) then we need to be as honest as possible with the shortcomings so people don't come in thinking we get 9+ raid bosses every second patch and they can reasonably consistently play a Firebrand healer in raids. 
---
OP here,thank you all for the kind input and tips,i m definitely having fun with it so far,still gotta get used to timing my AA chain to dodge during boss attacks,but its amazing so far!
---
I see, thanks for the explanation. I'll practise both rotations then :)
---
it would have been fine if they made it more of a city instead of a big flat slab of concrete with some buildings off in the distance.
---
Technically no dps is mandatory, although Mirage comes pretty close in some places. But the fact remains a record was set using a comp featuring 7/10 mesmers.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not supporting the current DH state. They both need to be nerfed.
---
Level 15 is literally 1 1/2 to 2 hours doing hearts/mapping only, no boosts. I've done it in under 1 1/2 hours on warrior with some opportune fast events including the Shadow Behemoth to finish that heart and hit L15 simultaneously. I include personal story once I hit L11 (not 10, wait for the extra skill), mainly for the key (in fact, I usually do it on my key farmer weekly just to try for a second key - got an iron node in my second key last week). Keep in mind warrior is my least favorite class to play, but it destroys low level areas fast (warrior's weakness seems to be mid-game mostly, IMO - that's where my warrior died fast and frequently and my guardian excelled at least, but I am a better player now, and base warrior is better than guardian in most high level content).
---
u maybe actually spoiling the next expansion's mastery tree, new expansion always introduce completely new system into the game and underwater combat maybe next, as the current system is pretty bad..
---
&gt; Set it in the mists 
---
Like a fractal - an echo of the past.
---
Ah okay. I'd suggest axe/torch and sceptre/pistol then so you have a melee mode and a range mode. 
---
Get food that increases endurance regeneration. More endurance = more Mirage Cloak= more survivability + higher DPS.
---
It's a bit annoying to play as you end up dodging about every two seconds or something but it makes a huge difference. I rebound dodge to E because of my mirage and that helped. 
---
Yep, "normally". The time is flexible if we go by experience (usually 30 minutes or so, but still), hence why I put "roughly" in the title! :)
---
Hi, I am a brand new player, level 9.  I did boost a character to 80 to get the mount, however.  What can I do to make sure I get this content to play it later?  If I unlock it on the level 80, will it be available on the level 9 later?  And what about Ep1-3?  Sorry for the dumb questions, but as there's a time limit I wanna do what I can.  Thank you.
---
I just checked, I was wrong
---
"Any character can see the living world, however you need to be lvl 80 to play them"
---
I might have gotten confused there and my memory distorted it into being 
---
"You can only unlock it after lvl 80"
---
wow refugees need only pay. 
---
Just by logging in you get it for free. So even if you didn't have the required expansion (PoF) it would still be playable for free once you bought it.
---
So if you haven't logged in for a while, do that. Otherwise you should be golden :)
---
Alright, so in Hero - Story Journal, Living World season 4 is there but all the stuff has padlocks next to it (I assume cuz you have to be level 80.)  But I have access to it, right?  Thanks.
---
Probably the easiest way is to fly there with a griffon from Vigil Keep.
---
Got any good vids on Season 1? 
---
Are you going to "back" to HoT? Because *that* has a hard start. 
---
I found most of PoF soloable apart from a few manic bits, but the expansion content is designed to push you as player. I would say get some cheapy exotic gear off the trading post and a matching (all six the same) set of runes. 
---
If you're returning, bare in mind that you might just be a bit out of practice. Rebinding the keys can be really helpful to stop you key-hunting or mouse-waving.
---
Technically the sign has a "No Raptor" indication.  That's why I always breeze through on my Springer.

You're absolutely allowed to have an opinion.

Just the same, others are allowed to have the opinion that yours reeks of entitlement.
---
What kind of trash? Veterans, normal mobs, etc? I run sword/dagger, what do you run? For normal mobs I literally just use sword fire 2 into fire 3 and they will die, if not, I auto once or twice. For veterans, if I need aoe I just fire 2 engage, fire 3, fire 5, fire 4, then I usually do water 3 into Fresh Air air 3. If they aren't dead I just continue my rotation. When it's a single target, I start with air 3 into fire. 
---
I usually run arcane shield and stone resonance and usually use glyph of storm, though sometimes I don't and just use the crit signet if I think I am clearing mobs too fast for it. Arcane shield and stone resonance allow you to tank a couple of hits. I also will often swap my traits to master's fortitude (Weaver adept 3) and/or bolstered elements (Weaver master 2) if I need the survivability. I find I don't need the extra damage most times and full zerker can be very fragile in some areas of expansion maps.
---
Do you have a source for that? Not saying you're incorrect, I just don't ever recall reading any kind of statement of that nature in any of the AMA's or similar.
---
you've been whooshed pretty hard, I never intented to call you a liar, it was a joke.
---
There is a very common saying in the development department :
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/HTisMpC
---
That's fair. I do see the value in going through the entire leveling process without boosters for the first time. In addition to the pve dailies you're seeing as you roam around there are also pvp and wvw dailies. Some of the pvp ones you can get easily in the pvp daily rooms if you just want to do them for the gold, but there's no requirement to do them. Just enjoy yourself and Tyria! 
---
Yes.
---
Please. 
---
Make it a VIP area, a guild hall, _anything_ so long as it shuts up the "old LA" crowd once and for all.
---
This is inaccurate the old map is in the game client in multiple versions. 
---
Thanks!  It's great so far, especially the community!
---
But since there is a story version that means that they have still some information left right? And for a guild hall it would make sense since they have to build a new one from scratch anyway.
---
I miss double Air sigils.  Me sad panda.
---
Actually no episodes 2, 3 and 4 released 5pm on their respective Tuesdays with maybe 2-3 minutes either side.
---
So welcome. Since no one else said this, I shall.  
---
Forget everything you know about MMOs when playing this game, it is fundamentally different and going into it with an open mind will greatly improved your enjoyment.  
---
Don't rush, the game is a journey, the destination isn't end game. 
---
Why not touching the hearts ?
---
Too low ratio xp/time doing them ?
---
Thanks !

I do underwater every day for krait kills in Maelstrom.  I don't understand the complaint that underwater movement and camera don't work.  I never have any trouble.
---
I use a trackball with for camera and movement with S and space for up down.  I never use action camera.
---
*opens this while watching Shadiversity's newest video about female armors*
---
If you logged in during the time that any of those were the active (most recently released) story then you will have access to them on any character once that character is level 80.
---
If you had not yet started playing the game at the time a living world episode was released then all previous episodes will need to be purchased as dlc for gems. Season 2, 3 and all earlier episodes of season 4 can all be purchased in this manner. Season 1 was a true live story that could only be experienced at the time of its release.
---
&gt;  I guess it'll be tricky to design the new expansion where not everyone has mounts while trying to keep it interesting and challenging for those who do
---
Which is why the old long abandoned plan to roll each expansion into the base game with the launch of each next expansion would have worked wonders for keeping everyone on the same page.
---
(History for anyone confused, back a ways maybe around going free2play there was a lot of talk of fractured playerbase and development having to build everything around people only having the base game, Anets plan was for expansions to roll into the base game as new expansions came out. The idea was to keep a single "current version" of the base game + one available expansion to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible. There was a huge outcry against this "how dare you give away something I paid for 3 years ago and have gotten 3000 of enjoyment out of" people cried "we care more about making people pay for things than future content being able to be designed knowing everyone has access to previous expansion features." We got it briefly, most physical copies available for a while included HoT [though you could still find the original super cheap], but now "buying the game" through Anet gets you base + PoF and HoT is an additional $20. I'd imagine if we get another expansion it will replace PoF as the "current version" and PoF will become an addon like HoT and the playerbase will fracture further.)
---
Just... I'm just curious. No offense or judgement from me. But why ? Do you want to test your eyes ? Other players eyes ? (these question are humour the real question comes now) Is it a roleplay choice ? I'm really interested with a rp explanation. 
---
Hey! Just wanted to pop in and give a similar perspective and also something to think about.
---
I played WoW for 10 years, played GW2 at the same time for a few of those years and bounced back and forth until a few months into BFA, when I wrote WoW off for good.
---
Your class is important for you to enjoy, and I do think Guardian will most likely be your best bet in terms of what you're looking for. Guardian was my first class and I love it. I have all classes at level 80 and my favorites are Guardian, Elementalist (best mage in any MMO), and Ranger. Warrior is also great.
---
One thing to note is that while your race isn't important in terms of gameplay, it will affect your enjoyability of part of GW2's endgame. Gw2 is often called Fashion Wars 2, because a lot of the draw to end game content is getting cool armor and dyes to craft your character into whatever you want them to look like. The race you choose will affect how armor looks on you and will open up the "Racial Armor" for each race for you to use. There are three sets for each type "Light, Medium, Heavy" that can be mixed and matched with any useable armor. Would definitely look into the armors and see what you like the most before you pick your main race!  
---
Have fun, feel free to shoot me a PM with your in-game name if you want any help/mentoring.
---
Yeah agree but permafrost is just white it’s isnt shinny right ?
---
Is the current key and scrap package in the gem store really value for money/gems? 900 for 10 keys ands 2 scraps
---
And where do you see that entitlement? What is wrong with stating the obvious fact that people who purchased the game before 2014  have already paid for that content? I'm not asking to be given anything for free.
---
Yep I started playing 2-3 days ago (so I guess I have chapter 3?) and I am logged in now, so I should have 4 :-)  Guess I have to buy 1 and 2...
---
It’s for a Rp purpose but I don’t want to have to go to night area every time I wanna do my shit. And I don’t want a silvery as well xd
---
Is your question how to achieve this look?  
---
The shinyness is from stacked Winter's Heart Infusions. 
---
I haven't been around in a couple months so dunno if things changed radically, but generally Reaper was a power focused spec, and Scourge was the condi focused spec, so I think people are indicating that going condi on a power class may have played into damage being lower than it could have. Again I haven't been around much the last few months so could be wrong, but that's how I'm reading those comments.
---
That was easy? Oh boy, really hope my refresher run will help get me back in shape.
---
Yes. 5 keys normally is 450, which is about 900 gems for 10. You're getting 2 scraps basically for free from that deal which could be (potentially) used alongside others gained from the chest to make a full ticket.
---
Not sure how its ruined? at that time of the night there are not enough coordinated people to get it to T4 anyway. And the most value item from it is the gemstone that you get from the boss kill
---
They say that he's still floating to this day. 
---
why use Superior sigil of air tho?
---
any of the 3 % dmg sigils should be better now
---
To get 3 you might have to go to store to get it for free becaus it is a special thing this time becaus of bttle racing
---
Oh this is neat. Thank you!
---
this was FANTASTIC
---
i just skimmered across brisban, thru SW and into verdant brink on my level 3. 
---
it’s gametime. 
---
You are also quite wrong. You use shield 5 for both hitting your allies and enemies. Shield 4 is just a button you use for whenever you need, not just for pushing.
---
Boonshare is gutted yes, that doesn't mean shield is bad.
---
If you're going for a minionmaster build, Flesh Golem is a pretty good helping hand if you've got it unlocked and will be your strongest CC. Blood Fiend will also be your passive 'healing' ability in combat, so I'd say those two are a must. 
---
ooo this is going to be so much FUN! thank you for letting me know! 
---
Well I’m starting almost from the beginning, I have a low level Mesmer that I’m going to run through the story as a refresher. 
---
I think it was a combination of being out of practice and low gear. Because when I actually sat up in my chair and focused on what my abilities do and watching for tells I was able to make progress, but I was still dying really quick when skills were on CD.
---
Really hope that refresher run gives me some good practice and helps get me to a good financial situation to buy exotic gear.
---
Ah ok, thanks. So: DH for Deimos then. 
---
&gt;I mean, it's pretty clear they're useless in the current form. Nobody uses them in any area of the game, which says an awful lot.
---
Is this an out of season april fools joke?
---
I updated the drivers and repaired, and it's still crashing but less often though.
---
Awesome job, Gratz!! Looking forward to more of these 👍
---
Yeah I'd recommend bringing a friend along to all PoF missions, if you can.
---
I will try this today. As far as repair, GPU update, it didn't work
---
The "Living World Season 3 Complete Pack" is in my store for 800 gems.  But I logged in a few days ago (before LS Season 4 came out) so...I dunno if that means I have it or not.  If it's in my list in Story Journal, I think that means I have it? (Because season 2 is not there).  Why it's in the store though, I don't know.
---
Do i have to have the full Dlc? or can i get the episodes normally without buying dlc
---
Nah, they got rid of daily revives a long time ago. ;-P
---
Superior Sigil of Air have static DPS numbers regardless of your usual DPS as long as you proc it off cooldown. Meaning that power classes that have lower DPS, but provide boons or buffs (theorized power Renegade support using upcoming Diviner rune set for example) can use Sigil of Air over Slaying Sigil for effective higher damage amplification. The Slaying sigils are also pretty trash compared to Air when it comes to very short burst damage - notably in WvW power ganking builds heavily favour power proc sigils, not just percentage DPS increase.
---
**For those who know about tabletop RPGs**
---
Can you recommend a system for playing in the Guild Wars universe? I tried Savage Worlds so far, but I'd like to see if there's something else  fit for the GW world and style. I know someone has done the GW2 professions for Dungeon Worlds, but I am not into that system.
---
I think you're mistaken. Episode 4 is what has been out for the last few months. Episode 5 comes out today. If you started 2-3 days ago you will not have unlocked episodes 1-3.
---
I suggest checking the gem store for the cost of season 2&amp;3 as well as episodes 1-3 of Season 4.
---
Winters heart infusion and permafrost will get you this look, permafrost is shiny but very very bright 
---
I believe you unlock the episode just by logging in but you can't actually play it unless you own the expansion.
---
Anyone who logs in during the time an episode is the current episode will unlock it for free.
---
However to play the episode itself you will need to have purchased the latest expansion at the time of the episodes release and have a level 80 character. The episodes you have unlocked for free will be there waiting for you whenever those two requirements are met.
---
What is this “friend” that you speak of?
---
Ohh OK, I am confused then.  I see, logging in only gets you the individual episode.  Yes I am missing all but the last episode of season 4.  Thanks.
---
I don’t think so. 
---
8 infusion doesn’t look shiny like this 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SQRN9U12A28
---
I remember seeing that comment by Gail on the official forum somewhere. 
---
Thats genius
---
As I said just up I don’t think so.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SQRN9U12A28
---
Winter heart infusion is not as shinny even with 8.
---
Sorry if it’s enough clear. The purpose is to fear really well the shinny effect of chaos weapons skins. Or the armor you get from getting AP I can’t remember the name
---
They can't. They admitted last year that they don't have the complete city anymore, just some parts that they saved for the instances. 
---
do i actually have to do any part of the story to keep it unlocked? or is just opening it enough?
---
&gt; you cant skip mechanics
---
There's actually still quite a few skips you can do just with weaver. Aetherblade is one example you can still do, you can also the skip to the boss in Cliffside with weaver (and xera portal), though the initial wind tunnels will be slower since only 1 blink. Pretty much any time you needed portal + blink you can use xera portal + lightning flash for daily runs.
---
Obviously if you're going for a speed record in the fractal with double blinks and portals in spots not commonly used in dailies like Urban fb+ren will not compete.
---
I like the idea of a sea area in which you need to move by ship, evading kraken like monsters that lurk under the waves.
---
All of that while trying to get to a spot to dive into an underwater cave.
---
Being in the water should be something you fear.
---
wrong. i'm pointing out that anet don't really seem to care if you aren't buying gold. people have been complaining about this for months and there are even people who have been cheating in wvw for 6 months + and there have been no consequences for that person. "because i thought they should be" yeah, because it's against the fucking rules maybe? 
---
Good chronos change skills around a lot.
---
For example, chronos on Cliffside spend nearly the entire fractal with blink/mimic/portal for skips, only swapping to wells/soi right before the boss.
---
It should be unlocked just by logging in on a character.
---
Don't forget to pre-stack with bunny for that sweet cc 
---
it's locked for me
---
Soulbeast is pretty optional. Pug soulbeasts don't take stance share usually and the spirit would fall under nice to haves. AP and Kalla more than make up for it
---
If an expansion or even just a LWS chapter was majority wet, it would be a bad business decision.  The vast majority of players don't want it.  While the game is attracting new players that are defecting from other games, I see many regular players from my guilds disappearing from the game as it is.  I think this would  accelerate that process greatly. 
---
When I did the beta test going in didn't dismount me but got a debuff on my bar saying it was a no mount zone (didn't look like the icon for the one that really works in jump puzzles) but it didn't work anyway
---
Dont worry they are cheap to get if needed.
---
Head over to Tyria 3D and look at your own dat file. Most of it is there. There are other reasons why it might not be as easy to give it to us now days: namely mounts. But if  they were to forbid mounts in there...

Amaterasu was a wolf with a single tail, and the Ninetailed Fox boss had golden fur to represent its age and power. So wouldn't the recommendation be to dye the Shrine Guardian, based on a Ninetailed Fox, shades of gold?

You need to have Path of Fire expansion to play expansion related content.

[Scholar Aiti](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scholar_Aiti)
---
Transaction history is clean and easy to read; great job! :)
---
One thing I don't understand is the purpose of a list
---
Is that like a custom filter you can save?
---
I’d personally prefer a small house that I could upgrade as a solo compared to the mammoth set of upgrade options available in Guild Halls. Feels to me like Home Instances are already most of the way there with this via all the nodes and such you can add, so all I’d like to see is a small house/apartment/whatever added to the Home Instance (it could even be the same basic structure for simplicity) with a number of furniture and other decoration options, scaled to be doable by individual players. Or, if the devs are looking for yet another resource sink, they could designate 3 properties in each Home Instance as player housing, at Small (a basic 1 BR apartment - the resource node upgrades would remain scattered in the Instance), Medium (a multi-bedroom house with a fenced yard/property that could accommodate the extra nodes for convenience), and Large size (a multi-level, walled mansion with guard barracks and stables and everything else, for players who have the time and energy to really trick it out). 
---
But she's a wolf, and the game literally features a boss fight against a nine-tailed fox with gold-hued fur...
---
&gt; But i heard that all classes are balanced, and so that is making me feel sad, because why need i to press like 30 keys to kill someone, if they can press 10 and kill me pretty easily. Is that true? Or is it worth it play elementalist? 
---
Keep in mind that the whole kit of Elementarist revolves around that fact. Every skill used heals you, grant boons and boons interact with traits. Having 30 skills also give the Ele a lot of choices to keep pressure. Different from other classes that after the burst can only run away or auto attack.
---
That said, PvP wise Ele is indeed in need of better days. For other reason that are unrelated to their skill set. Also irrelevant on lower skill brackets.
---
&gt; And im looking for some maybe video tutorials about basics of game, like craft and stuff. Ive seen videos but those are for lvl 60-80, i dont even know if i shoud sell stuff or keep for later. 
---
You are free to heard any material as long as your bank have space to keep then. You can save up to 250 units of each material by clicking on "Deposit All materials" inside your bag.
---
Market wise, GW2 market is pretty darn simple. There is no need to worry about getting scammed for itens price here. Just sell then straight to the market. Outside patch notes its rare for the price of itens to change.
---
About crafting, there are few changes since the game started years ago, you can just go with any guide.  
---
Most people only do crafting at lvl 60+ since it also gives you experience and some people like to use crafting to get the few last 15\~20 levels if they have the money to spent.
---
Alas, just like other games, learn crafting to produce your own equipment is often a bad idea. Just purchase what you need straight from the Trading Market.

Some Information:
---
*There will be an exotic and an ascended version
---
*You need at least 1.760 of the new map currency for all 16 exotic weapons.
---
*You probably need all 16 weapons for the ascended ones, because there is a collection, which activates something new. We expect we get the new recipes for the ascended weapons by completing the collection.
---
I'm about to start playing and I'm on a doubt about going warrior, thief or another spec, can someone give me some tips? I'd prefer melee dps specs based on physical damage (Idk if it is a classification, but I used to main a rogue and alt warr and monk on wow), I seen a few videos about the specs, there is a thread here where I can find some further help?
---
How come this never affects people without GWAMM? I've never had any of my achievements removed or rewards.
---
Air being better for low dps is certainly in certain situations, but the meta sigils for pve are typically force and impact.  Burst heavy situations in pve are almost exclusively coupled with broken break bars.  Especially in fractals, impact sigils aint no joke.  
---
Tx joko they are ungly. I can skip them. Couldn't do another nullification armor
---
You actually believe this?!
---
Old Lion's Arch was removed from the game. It is no longer part of the game content that you have paid for. Giving access to it in any fashion other than Personal Story instances would thus constitute an *additional* and/or *optional* feature. Just like Mistlock.
---
&gt; where WvW lets you zerg train while "upscaled" to 80, gaining experience along the way as well as tomes from rewards. 
---
You don't get experience in WvW (atleast not towards your "level"). You only get WXP and tomes. 
---
You can earn the tomes just as quickly (well, quicker because you won't be dead 24/7 and almost useless even when you're not on the floor) on a lvl 80. So if you use WvW to level, go on a level 80 and simply use the tomes. Joining zergs in WvW as uplvl'd is a good way to get flamed. 
---
PvP you can play at any level. 
---
they will never understand

Are we sure on the laurel part? I'm only using Google Translate to read the page, but it's not clear whether you need 5 laurels per weapon, or 5 laurels for the book with a full set of recipes.
---
If 95 laurels is in fact correct, that's more heavily gated and restricted than the Requiem armor, and it's damned disappointing.
---

Probably because it's such a special case achievement where you need to have your GW account with a certain score in the Hall of the Monuments linked to your GW2 one. If this link somehow fails/isn't recognized anymore the achievement gets revoked as you are no longer eligble to have that title.

Naturally, as far as Open World and Story mode goes, fell free to use anything.

And yes, you can go Full Berserker or mix match some Marauder for extra vitality. Warriors have high natural sustain so you can go full berserk at open world and they won't let you down.
---
"The penultimate episode"
---
Well, that confirms S4E6
---
&gt; You need 95 Laurels for all 16 exotic weapons
---
On par with other ascended weapon costs. Hopefully there are ways to get the recipes through drops, as well - either in events or in the story, to mitigate some of this - since a number of other ascended recipes can be found on the TP as well as via laurels.
---
Gs is very decent sustained damage (autos should be hitting 3 targets) with an aoe that also boonstrips, and a decent burst from phantasmal zerker. Skill2 should be followed up with mind wrack to instantly pop the clone for a bit more burst as well (but isnt neccisary). In a pirate ship meta (scourge just got buffed, rev is still busted) i still dont see how shield is good, especially since boon duration doesnt do much for a utility mes anymore 
---
A lot of the exotic ones are kind of boring, but i suppose that's the point

1) World Boss train: hit every world boss as it comes up on its timer, especially Tequatl if you are high enough level.
---
2) Gather every node you see: in lower level maps, things like hard wood and platinum are more abundant, and sell for a lot since they are less abundant in higher-level maps.
---
3) Dungeons. Contrary to popular belief, dungeons are absurdly profitable. If you are in your 60s or even 50s but have good, level-appropriate rare or exotic gear, you could absolutely get through and contribute to dungeon runs. 
---
4) Dailies. While not that great for XP, they are a reason to play, and 2 gold a day every day is not a bad incentive to try out whatever PvE content it is directing you towards.
---
Thanks for your sacrifice! I was considering looking at it but I don't want spoiled (even a little.)
---
That's what I was thinking all along - we'r killing Kralk this chapter, and the next one sets the story for another season/expac ^(which will be happening on ocean-based maps) ^^and ^^we'll ^^get ^^^an ^^^underwater ^^^mount ^^^^at ^^^^the ^^^^end ^^^^of ^^^^this ^^^^season...
---
Yaaaay. Super excited for tomorrow :D
---
&gt; LS5 will reach unprecedented scales. 
---
Please share the drugs you're on. I want some. 
---
Bigger question: How do you convince pugs to join you if you're a Renegade?
---
Shouldn't it be 85? 16&amp;times;5 for the weapon recipes and another 5 for the inscription?
---
What is the reptilian version of a furry?
---
Scaly?
---
What the OP probably meant is that it might be using the iGPU instead of the discreet GPU
---
Rushing achievement as long as enough ppl playing the content.
---
Might actually be the first Legendary I grind out and complete without running off to do other things in between. Looks simple, yet elegant, and perfect aesthetically for my Dragon Hunter!
---
I do my best to AFK through the story on ele until I get the wvw / pvp reward track, then I nope the fuck out of there. 
---
Yes? I realized there’s potential for many, many underwater expansions, not just the DSD. Aquaman made me realize there’s nearly as much potential there as on land
---
It’s already available?
---
Hey! I’m a new player. Just reached lvl 30 with a necromancer. Anyone wanna play together or send some playingtips my way? I have no clue what I’m doing. Pm me :)
---
Fractal seem to have Smogscales and nto Smokescale (the ones from Draconis Mount): Way less cancer because you can still hit them if you are out of their somke/smog zone.
---
Rollign Devils look fluffy though :p
---
well i want to explore the open world while grinding level points. gw2 open world is so beautiful and it will be such a waste not to explore it. i am a returning player and i think ive had enough of the pvp experience and want to try other things.
---
While definitely true I don't farm fracs or LWS3 often, so laurels are the most convenient way to get them. Sure it'll take forever and there are better things to use them on but I'm not too broken up about it.
---
The kneed is clipping through the skirt :(
---
Hmm... Not too big on having to spend laurels.
---
I hope they won't be necessary for the LS4 equivalent of Aurora.
---
Does the video show what hard to get  rune is needed for the weapons?  
---
As long as you keep your cynical cookies away, I wouldn't want an overdose.
---
Seriously though, Anet has stated in May they were restructuring their team for better and bigger efficiency. Thanks to how production pipelines work, these changes couldn't involve LS4 since it was already deep into production.
---
Combined to the fact that Anet has said they plan to release expansion worthy features through episodic formats from now on give a bright future, really.
---
LS episodes have been getting bigger. meatier and better (minus Long Live the Lich) for the most part and LS5 is supposed to replace an expansion.
---
So I'm really hopeful for LS5.
---
Two of the most profitable farms are open world: Domain of Istan and Silverwastes.
---
In PvE you get different rewards. As you said, experience, but also karma, and a loot based on what you kill. Otherwise in PvP you get only gold and the limited amount of rewards from reward track.
---
If you would math it to gold per hour, certain PvE parts will be way more profitable than PvP, BUT after you sell most of your loot to the trading post. 
---
Having bank full of materials is as wealth as having a lot of gold, you will find this out once you will start crafting bigger things like ascended oreven legendaries. Crafting without need of buying materials is very satisfying.
---
Yeah, like maybe we will get 2 hours worth of non-repeatable content instead of 1
---
Nope! You can also tp to a guild Hall and walk out to VB/AB/ETC from it. 
---
having a power chrono (illusions variant) with portal for lamp is actually very good, since it also allows one of the support chronos to take either double wells or well+mimic, at  a a low personal dps cost for the chrono. the portal is used on pyres AND to skip the JP at last phase.   
---
the reason why you take illusions is for the focus pull on lamp, while also keeping sword offhand for the extra block, which adds some safety if you're soloing.
---
Look I'm gonna step forward and recognize it:
---
Sometimes I'm that asshole that goes afk and prefers to stare at the screen while checking the phone or rolling one smoke.
---
Why? Because after all these years I've never been punished and therefore I don't feel the need to behave properly.
---
PvP is a ghetto nowadays, that's sad but what can you do? Anet doesn't care and at the end of the day it's all about my reward track :/
---
I didn't have the glider cause I didn't play HoT
---
Im downloading the game on my bf's pc right now because i wont be able to be at home in time for that, if i open the game mid download would it count?
---
You play the game. Explore what seems interesting, follow npc's to events and do the story as you unlock it.
---
Chasing a checklist  of systematically doing map completion goals and grinding through hearts a map at a time is the number one cause of burn out leading to new players quitting the game.
---
Taking a more natural approach still fills a lot of hearts just from completing events on the way and spontaneous discovery of jumping puzzles, mini dungeons, hidden areas or finding hidden paths to areas makes the experience more fun. Once you've played though enough to know the areas well it's easy to go back and fill in the gaps IF you want to bother going for map completion/gen 1 legendaries.
---
&gt;While I won’t spoil the story, it certainly reaches some new heights and you’ll need to soar if you’re going to reach an Elder Dragon after all.
---
actual flying confirmed?
---
i doubt full on flying part but does seem very likely we'll finally be riding Aurene for this episode.
---
I definitely will keep that in mind once I have some spare income again :)
---
on new LW releases i always go through on my main first and basically try to complete the whole story plus achieves in maybe 2 weeks or so.  My main is the only character to have done every bit of story so far purely because I didn't really start building up other characters' campaign progression until after PoF.  The next closest is my AB-story rev and i've been going through HoT whenever i take breaks from AP grinding with my main.
---
Only the first 30 levels of story (out of 80) are based on your race, and you can help your friends play through it even if you aren't the same race, you just won't get rewards. After that, everyone can play along at the same time for full credit if you want to (though there are branching paths different players can take if they want to—doing so is a bit technical though so if you want to do that be sure you know what you're doing first). Regardless: While story *unlocks* based on what level you reach, it isn't going to gate you at all, so you can always wait for the other members of your group to catch up before you play through a section.
---
No. Tomorrow's patch.
---
Mistlock Sanctuary isn't content removed from the game. Hardly the same thing, and it would set a bad precedent of players paying for content they shouldn't need to. 
---
But whatever, I'm done arguing, it's clear people don't agree and I've made my point very clear.
---
Are you on EU or US servers? I'm on EU, RageHippo.7951. If you're in the US, do you have any specific questions you would like to get answered? :)
---
how many chronos were running Delayed reactions? or is the slow coming ~~just~~ mostly from timewarp and well of action? 
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah we don’t just shift old weapons around
---
Warriors can become brawlers. 
---
Guardians can become dragoons
---
And so on 
---
what? no. both are in a pretty good place. what needs to be balanced is the rest of the game in general!
---
How about a quick text summary of the significant results. Not all of us want to watch a video of BL keys.
---
Yeah that makes sense
---
* A light armor class using longbow (ideally) or rifle as a 1500 range weapon. Preferably Arcane Archer for ele, but any of the three would do. Currently only DE and ranger have 1500 range, and both are medium armor.
---
* "Brawler", a melee thief spec, using mace(s) - defensive/block and counter oriented. Could be a tank in pve, or a bunker in pvp. Needs to be highly selfish, low group support, but very difficult to knock over.
---
* Some form of "Anti-Paladin" guardian spec, using daggers, as a heavily condi-based option with more than just burning. Think, "bleed on cripple" or "apply confusion when attacking with more than X might stacks" and so on. Condi guard needs some diversity beyond burning in order to be interesting, and Firebrand doesn't quite get there.
---
bring back core mesmer(power)
---
Bunker? You mean side-noder?
---
there are multiple instances, two with the vigil storyline which cover the underground water system and the old portal area, three with the Order of Secrets line which cover bank and the crafting area and the docks when moving out with the decoy Tybalt (rip), then theres the priory with the old tp area. So yes its mainly covered already
---
ok :) I will make one soon 
---
*This is why the gods left Tyria!*
---
I would like to see:
---
* the Revenant gain access to the Greatsword, possibly by channeling Trahearne and gaining some Necromancer-esque summoning abilities, focusing on the circle of (plant) life and death as the theme.
---
* The Ranger getting access to the Rifle and taking on a sort of Safari Hunter vibe which would blend in some Mesmer skills (creating a decoy of the Ranger or their pet that taunts their target before exploding to deal damage sort of thing) and make traps a bit more interactive, such as choosing when to set them off and turning them invisible so you can strategically hit an entire group instead of it going off when a single target wanders into it
---
* The Necromancer getting a bloodier vibe. Crimson colored spells, access to a Mace in the main hand that they use at range, possibly access to a Simulacrum ability that cuts their life force, but has a constant "companion" helping them deal damage and mimic their abilities at a lower effectiveness.
---
Mounts and gliding! Gliding feels fun and useful for avoiding fall damage. The mounts in guild wars are some of the best in gaming in my opinion. They have weight to them, making you feel like your actually riding an animal. The movement abilities are fun, engaging, and very useful. A much better feeling than the speed boost most mmo mounts feel like. Both gliding and mounts can be used in the core maps as well (with the exceptions of some instances and jumping puzzles).
---
gw2crafts.net
---
I really hope they have an actual massive keep somewhere on the map cuz some ice and some scattered dredge machinery isnt exactly hype inducing...
---
Oh, I do this on NA, but it’ll probably be similar for EU. Server time is on UTC.
---
with all due respect compare it to most gem store sets and you have answer about non legendary/non gemstore rewards state in game for past few years...
---
Looks like it gonna cost a lot, and that's fine but let's be honest - not much effort was put into it imo
---
You never really make currency gains doing leveling in the traditional exploration sense - not in any game I've ever played, anyway.
---
Usually this is because of a sharp division between "leveling" and "buildup" - where once you hit the cap, you're going to have to abandon all your old gear and gather resources instead of experience.
---
PvP is very good on gold. PvE can be, once you hit 80, but not usually before then.
---
If you want to explore, then explore! It's fun!
---
is it the same as the old pvp forge?
---
This is hard to implement because of loot tables. They would have to implement new skins. Although we could have underwater weapone like spear above water
---
Didn't see the edit before my reply. I would like to see more weapon options eventually, but I also feel there's quite a bit left in the current weapon pool to make interesting elites out of
---
They have also gotten slower, with some releases really missing the mark. On top of that, the releases in all other areas have also declined. 
---
Your optimism is wonderful, but I don't see huge improvements in the speed or scale of LW, and all other content is certainly slowing down. 
---
seriously?... no effect in the barrage skill... come on guys....
---
Obviously it would take time and resources for ANET to do this, so expecting it for free is obviously not reasonable.  We never paid for  guaranteed permanent access to 2014's LA.   If it's you position that would not pay for this, that's fine. But to expect it for free just as reasonable as going into you favorite restaurant and expecting a free meal.  
---
I'm probably misusing the term, I'm honestly not very experienced in pvp in GW2, much less with the usual phrasing.
---
I generally see thief as a hit and run class, rather than being able to sit on a point and hold it - either bullying people off side nodes, or being the unkillable asshole in middle mosh pits.
---
Warrior has blocks, ele has huge evades - I'd say Brawler thief could be similar to holosmith with a lot of CC and counters, but much lower damage? Something like that.
---
True that, I always felt that the new maps where unrewarding compared to the season 3 ones and I couldn't understand why at first. After playing for hours doing events and achievements a barely had any volatile magic to show for it, its pretty bad.
---
If you're not having that much fun then take a longer break. I have recently started a "big" break as a mostly PvE players (I have WvWed quite a lot but that was a long time ago now) so no more regular fractals or raids because I wasn't having fun anymore and playing with friends did outweight that anymore. So now I'm mostly gonna come for updates like that while playing very casually (doing story and a couple of stuff every once in a while).
---
At some point maybe you've jsut taken everything you had to take from the game and you're not getting back enough/much anymore so it's time to move on slightly if you're not having fun anymore.
---
I know it kinda sounds grim/dark but it's only because it can be hard to move on after spending a lot of time on a single game. That doesn't mean you can't follow the game or come to test the updates every once in a while but going to try other thing might be beneficial.
---
I refuse to watch this because it isn't a round 1024.
---
it's actually fairly easy to create [covered](https://i.imgur.com/XXRmU1i.jpg) [light](https://i.imgur.com/90BFrf6.jpg) [looks](https://i.imgur.com/kwRnJQQ.jpg), and [heavy](https://i.imgur.com/m36p1MT.jpg) ones as well. just gotta dig around the wardrobe a bit and mix and match :D
---
Corrected the above then - that makes much more sense.
---
Anet says lots of things.  Anet's really good at promising everything, and then really, really shitty on following up on those promises.  Also, there's a negative infinity percent chance we're going to get a new race in the living story.
---
Why must everything have a pinkish or baby blue hue to it? So tired of everything looking the same. Seems like their entire spectrum consists of pink, mauve, baby blue, teal and fire.
---
No. 
---
I fell out of the TOP 250 in PvP. I have more points than the last few spots, and more than enough minimum required games. Why do people with with less points than me get into the TOP 250 though?
---
As someone playing on a very old computer, I see almost no details. Its amazing to me that this game can look so nice
---
Good times...
---
Though it does kinda crack me up that two of the notable public enemies in HoT, pocket raptors and rolling devils, are best, easiest, and most neatly countered by the elaborate defense known only as...
---
"Get up on a rock"
---
My collision slider is already 70%-80% to the right but that was not the collision I was referring to.
---
There are columns, ceiling beams, "floating" boxes, etc. There are similar portions on land but the land portions didn't pack things so tightly. Now that I think about it most boss areas on land are free of all that clutter.
---
Sure, I'm not saying it's bad and no doubt statics would run it still. I doubt CM pugs would sit around waiting for one though
---
The recipe could cost 15 laurels  
---
Edit: nevermind, I saw your translation below. Maybe there's a recipe for weaponsmith, one for huntsman and a last one for the artificer? So 3x5 laurels in total for recipes.
---
The base game is free but limited since there's 2 expansions. I'd say just buy the 2 expansions. You'll have \_way\_ more than 60 hours of content available without buying anything more than that. If you want more story you can buy the older living world seasons. I'm on my second stint of the game with \~350 hours in and there's some major aspects of the game I haven't even really touched yet ... dungeons, fractals ... and I still have tons of older story to finish.
---
Yeah, the best reward for having both expansions is Springer + Glider (or Griffon) in HoT maps.
---
Hopping away from, then soaring over mobs in the jungle sometimes still causes me to giggle and tell the mobs a quick f you.
---
Holy spoiler Batman! Tag this please.
---
Some years ago KongZhong was punished for publishing such a detailed outlook.
---
Bloodstone Fen? O_o
---
BFF should be much better.
---
Well, the thing is that it's not burnout keeping me away, it's ANet's decisions on WvW and class balance.
---
Let's not pretend like you didn't know that.
---
What's hot and pof stand for? I can search after that :)
---
Heh ... where is that guy that was complaining about lack of sales
---
I literally just started playing and when I saw the sign I smirked; so when I saw this post I genuinely laughed.  The post just simply wasn’t made for you, that’s all.  There is no shared consciousness among the player-base of GW2 you know.
---
Shield's pretty useful on DH in Fractals. You can use the shield bubble to completely avoid having to dodge the turrets-on-the-stairs part of Uncategorized, stop the hp threshold fire-killing attacks from the ice elemental in Snowblind, couple it with a Wall of Reflection for projectile hate at the Uncategorized bosses, absorb hits from Harpies in Uncategorized, and give yourself some extra CC in Nightmare when you're with a party that doesn't have enough to break the 2nd boss's breakbar.
---
lol no, wasnt that. I think it was something about using a malice sigil over, I think, bursting on a class where 18 expertise infusions were recommended and you dont have said infusions and malice wasnt going to cap duration. 
---
Actually, it's the opposite. The design of old LA was included in multiple trailers and it was present in the released game, only to be removed later. The laws regarding games might be vague, but from customer's point of view re-adding the city as an additional, paid content would be questionable.
---
Whether re-adding it again requires additional resources is none of our business, since it was not in any way our decision to replace the city with another model. If it was a bad decision, it was their own decision, not ours. Agreeing to having to pay the price equal to 1/6 of that of the base game for a content which was removed from the launched game is literally agreeing to being scammed.
---
Well said.
---
And the auto level adjustment has the added benefit of making sure that veterans can still be found in most central Tyria maps at all times. 
---
It's not like Metrica or Ashford, etc. is just a bunch of newbie madness.
---
I thought it was going to be "no glow" -&gt; "glow" but it looks like it is actually "glow" -&gt; "MOAR glow". Especially the GS
---
I mean we have no idea how it will be balanced...
---
If it's like bitterfrost frontier, 1760 isn't all that much.
---
I ran half a dozen characters through Sandswept and never got enough VM to justify purchasing karmic retribution or the experience boost.  The VM take in Kourna and Jahai was so low that I didn't even bother with map boosts.  Having to grind VM on one map (Istan) to pay for boosts on others is a no-go for me.  It's the same with the Diflourite accessories - I was mining Sandswept for Diflourite but still had to grind Istan to get enough VM.  With LWS3 you're far more likely to cover your UM costs while grinding map currencies, to the point where UM isn't really something you need to farm large quantities of directly.
---
If episodes 2 - 4 are anything to go by I don't expect to get enough VM from completion of the new map with a single character to cover the cost of the portal scroll.
---
Am I the only one that would be supremely disappointed if we Kill Kralk this episode (Or potentially, even in episode 6)?
---
To me, Kralk's been setup since day 1 to be this final boss.  He destroyed destiny's edge, killed snaff and glint.  He's the dragon that has an entire separate lore book written about him.  He's got Balthazar's power now, he's invaded the mists... And there's still a bunch of other shit that needs to be solved like the other three dragons.  I mean shit, we don't even know steve's real name.
---
It definitely feels like we're winding down to the end of Kralk's story, but personally I'm just not sure how they're going to get me to care about Steve at all since they won't even share his name.
---
This question may sounds strange but bear with me:
---
if the bow shoot light as projectiles, Where are those arrows coming from in the barrage animation? 
---
Its never done before its never an excuse. 
---
I will do that, I didn't know that selling the bags netted profit there like SW. Although SW bags get opened... so I dunno wth I am talking about. 
---
Farm Istan -&gt; Sell bags.
---
It’s a toxic elitist guild
---
Yikes.
---
I'm usually the one who gets downed, I'm too far gone to recover, and when someone breaks off to help me, I'm all, "Don't res me. Keep fighting."
---
Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire
---
As a Mesmer main I would love to have access to a Hammer (just because picturing it in my brain it sounds fantastic) or a bow of some kind. But that is just a personal goal or wish. 
---
Or added availability of a pistol / pistol or something like that would be interesting. 
---
ArenaNet employees have access to a special guild whose tag is the ArenaNet logo on their private (i.e. non-dev) accounts. They occasionally claim keeps and towers in WvW, too.
---
Yeah, kind of along those lines. I'd hesitate to tie it to the attunement due to becoming a little too close to Overload on tempest, but it's an option.
---
The idea of periodically getting access to a "charged shot" skill off the attunement itself would be good. Likely as an F5 skill; you attune, have to use a certain number of skills, then get a unique-to-element nuke afterward once the quiver's full.
---
Wow, I must have a rubbish graphics card because this detail is foreign to me.
---
Playing story on my guard, then exploring the new map with every class.
---
Well Engineer already got the heat mechanic done in the last one, so one possible next step is a chemist-like spec. The goal of the spec would be versatility and adaptability, with less of a focus on buffs to differentiate it from elixirs. It'd come with the regular, rather normal set of abilities, but instead of toolbelt skills it'd get 'reagents', and using this reagent before using the skill would change it's functionality.
---
For instance, we could have a skill that causes a short-ranged powerful explosion centered around the engineer, let's call it Instant Reaction.
---
So baseline, Instant Reaction is an elite skill that deals moderate damage and knocks enemies back, on a moderate cooldown (think the holo's elite)
---
But then you can have a Coolant Reagent, which makes Instant Reaction deal less damage but instead freeze/stun everything around the target. Or a Thermal Reagent that removes the knockback component entirely, and instead greatly increases the area of the explosion and douses everything in flames. 
---
Now, there's a catch. Each Reagent has it's own individual cooldown and affects only one skill, so if your opponent sees you use the ice reagent, it knows it won't have to be afraid of being stunlocked.
---
So yeah, I think that's a cool direction for Engineer to head to.
---
Really cool Greatsword I wonder if the pink glow is dye-OH WAIT
---
As i said in the post i already know about Istan but its mindnumbing boring to farm it over and over again.
---
If anything it would give a compelling reason to buy various episodes.  Istan is basically Bitterfrost for LWS4 at this point - it's the farming map everyone recommends, as the rest just don't compare. 
---
The same way stats aren't canon, skills aren't either - not really.
---
For dragonhunter, you're *actually* shooting arrows of light. Warrior and ranger? Not so much. I mean hell, if you're not using a quiver backpiece skin, the "redraw" animation makes no sense either, but it's there.
---
There's only so far you can take that stuff, honestly.
---
Ah yes, the process of turning every detail into a pink/purple illusion.  Mesmer-izing!
---
Anyone knows what "erslene serpentit-juewele" means? As far as google translatess goes I get it to exquisite something jewel. I need to know for scientific purposes totally unrelated to buying things on the tp......
---
Also the fact they flat out said that Ep3 was halfway through the season
---
Yes that! Bunny cc is great start. 
---
Right; an elite spec that actually uses a similar playstyle to being kit-heavy like base Engi, rather than just tolerating it like Scrapper or, uh, scrapping it like Holo.
---
For metas like TD and Teq I waypoint when downed, even when someone starts rezzing me.
---
There've been a few open world events where I've showed up, gotten downed instantly, and then repeatedly rezzed by well-meaning players who apparently can't read me screaming DNR!!!! in /say, as I want to be DEAD so I can waypoint and adjust my build.  Fortunately that's an edge case.
---
Also a good point. Gem store sales usually make a compelling argument.
---
Maybe if the shipment items rotated availability, as well, the way map rewards do? Each day/week a different map has the trophy shipment or leather shipments people buy.
---
The game is jam-packed with content since the expansion launches. You've got 2 expansion campaigns and 3 Living Story campaigns to go through with storylines and achievements, somewhere around 15-20 new maps, 2 new specializations per class that drastically change the way the class is played, the mastery system which adds account benefits such as gliding, mounts, or increased rewards in Fractals... PvP and WvW are drastically improved since 4 years ago. Raids and Fractals are a thing and they're fantastic end game PvE. 
---
Seriously some of the best value in content for MMORPGs.
---
Yes its the Arenanet guild but its technically the a GW2 banner,
---
I refuse to watch this because its not 2018 keys in 2018!
---
But I still want to know the results :)
---
It’s a preview so there’s bound to be minor spoilers of some sort. 
---
Is the site broken on Firefox or is it just on my end?
---
ITS MY MONEY AND I NEED IT NOW. 
---
Revenant getting greatsword with balthazar as a legend. If you disagree with this fine but it makes total sense.
---
That could also work pretty well. Fire could be a scorching bolt you fire in a straight line, Water creates a "rain" of healing arrows that also chill enemies in the radius. Air could bounce between targets, slowing enemies and speeding up allies. Earth could stun and bleed a target for a good duration, also chunking breakbars for a decent amount.
---
I was going for a bit of Weaver feel without all abilities being transformed when swapping attunements. Collect arrows passively while attuned, mix and match as you swap elements, then fire the volley of mixed elements when you deem it appropriate.
---
it "feels" that way because it is. Pvp rewards a few silver after each map, and in ranked the league/division chests reward more gold. Pve rewards very very little gold, you get plenty of items that you have to break down for crafting to then sell on the tp or just sell the item on the tp to get your gold but you get very little liquid gold.
---
I love longbows, and I'm so glad the second legendary looks so good. I'll make this one for sure. It's been such a long wait. I can't believe it'll finally be here.
---
It'll probably be dagger, honestly. This is quite much a spec not focused on hitting the dude directly, so a small weapon that doesn't gets in the way but can be used in a pinch seems appropriate, not to mention that having a knife in hand is useful to prepare formulas when it comes to cutting ingredients and such.
---
dragonsblood makes me think of crystal lodestones. those also don't have much of a use atm.
---
It's possible it might get too close, but if you take some liberties with the "rifle" thematic and have Mesmers using the rifle like an assault weapon, peppering enemies with frequent but small damage and applying conditions as opposed to heavy shots, it would diversify it more than enough from Deadeye, Engineer Rifle, and Warrior rifle.
---
Alternatively, you could go the route of having a reload mechanic that could offer unique perks while reloading such as "gain 0.5 seconds of Distortion if you reload before entirely emptying your clip." The weapon could have high impact rounds in this case, but you're limited to 4 skills and 5 is "Reload." Less stealth and straight-up damage, more control effects like condition application or possibly firing on an enemy at a distance to instantly swap position with them.
---
The leaderboards just don't update properly. SR is the only thing that matters.
---
Well it was free since it released some months back, this is the last chance to grab it for free though since the new episode comes out tomorrow (and that will be free until the next episode, and so on).
---
Yeah. That's the collision I was talking about. That remaining % will make the camera ignore those boxes and beams.

Returning player here. I'm working on my cookie cutter Chronomancer boon support build. I'm just wondering if I should craft ascended Commander's gear, or wait to see what happens after the new gear set (Diviner's I believe) comes out? Thank you!
---
..........Sooooo.....you DONT like the Norn voice? 
---
You're on point, the article has not been proofread.
---
I wouldn't mind another "physical" looking staff. There just aren't many skins that can look good on a daredevil/revenant. 
---
Those look fucking fantastic.  And bows that look like bows!
---
I may have to reconsider my main's gallant weapons.
---
Doing story with my friends -&gt; 100% map - &gt; new fractal (I don't do raids) -&gt; map achievements.
---
Been pretty satisfied with this pattern for now.
---
yes! it would be so cool
---
I am referring to my character bumping into those things while trying to move around not the camera colliding with them. The setting won't have any impact on that.
---
A thief spec that actually changes how thief plays.
---
“No one says no to me!”
---
Depends how much currency you can get per day.  If you can get 20 per day, yes, it's insane.
---
If you can collect 300 per day, it's not really anything.
---
I don't think more unique stuff is such a glorious idea for supports. It's a nightmare for balancing and makes a spec mandatory too easily, as spirits, banners and 10-target might demonstrate. But apart from that point - yes, more support variety please. Which means at least one new class handing out quickness and another for alacrity, please.
---
How many stacks did you buy?
---
No, they're going to require a new material from the new map, resulting in a new gem with Diviner stats.
---
An Arcane attunement on the Elementalist, forgoing swapping between 4 attunements for the ability to swap weapons, and opening up "Arcane" attunement skills on all previous weapons (not counting elite weapons) would be rather nifty, especially if for the sake of coding the Elementalist is counted as being in "all four attunements at once" so they can still use any available base specialization path (Fire, Water, Air, Earth) but possibly to a slightly reduced effectiveness.
---
Make it dual pistols and I'd be all over that in a heartbeat
---
This is a really brilliant idea.   
---
he has that same humor &lt;3
---
thank you &lt;3
---
I am always here^^ and on Instagram @melireddraws 
---
Sitting on a bunch are we?
---
in love^^ right? &lt;3
---
I could only afford 39 (not stacks, 39 burls) since I spent about 100g yesterday on some legendary crafting :(. Yes they use the new materials too I the video I linked but also maguuma burls.
---
While others want new weapons added to classes, I want to see a *Core* Elite spec that alters the function of weapons the base class has access to.  Like the way some of your traits can augment certain skills, an elite set that changes the way skills 1-5 work would be interesting.  So weapons have new and interesting functionality.  Maybe introduce traits that would bring the core professions back up to the power level and usefulness of the HoT and PoF elites.  Maybe even a trait that powers up the racial elite that are never used.  I'd love to have a reason for my Norn to change into Bear form, cool golems for the asura, stronger avatars for humans, etc.
---
Otherwise, I'd like to see less power creep and more counter play in elites.  For instance, for a balance to the condi meta, consider an ability like Dark Aura for necromancer that deals AoE damage every time a condition is applied to you.  As you collect more conditions, the enemy(ies) take increasing amounts of damage.  Would be interesting to see a mechanic like this in PvP and WvW as well.
---
Necromancer - Ritualist elite that gives access to summoning Spirits utilities.
---
Thief - Avenger elite that allows them to use greatsword and Consecration skills.
---
Revenant - Dervish with access to Meditations that grant them boons for survival.
---
Guardian - Unnamed with access to Conjured-weapon utilities.
---
Engineer - Unnamed with access to Minions in the form of little clockwork or magical/alchemical imbued bots/machines.
---
Elementalist - Unnamed with access to either/or both Clones/Phantasms skills.
---
Ranger - Unnamed that allows them to use powerful Venom utilities.
---
Warrior - Maybe Elixirs or Mantas?
---
Mesmer - Unnamed with access to Daggers and maybe Glyphs or Cantrips?
---
It's hard to say with so many possibilities and not knowing how the elites will fit into the flavor of the next major location.  If we knew more about where we were headed we'd be able to create more lore appropriate elites and skills.
---
Anyway, the weekly "what new elites do you want" thread is always fun for a "what if" side-track down theory crafting lane.  Cheers.
---
Did it? I was under the impression that it was still around, but I might very well be wrong, since I dont see it on the BLTS, owning the chapter and all.
---
I made 42k vm in 8 hours sooo
---
Yeah I mean this is a personal vendetta for me because I want to play as just a water mage. And having dual pistols on an ele would be dope. 
---
But it also opens up like 4 new classes for ele.
---
Water is mostly healing
---
Fire is condi
---
Electricity is mostly single target dps. 
---
And earth is cc/ condi
---
Arcane is just to trigger the traits 
---
I don't know if you can really say "it's getting worse with each episode": episode one of this season also introduced two new weapon sets -- Astral and Stellar -- that upgrade from one into the other. Each weapon in each set requires 500 Kralkatite Ore apiece plus another 560 for all of the recipes. That totals out to 16,560 of said episode's map currency.
---
That said, Kralkatite Ore is rewarded a bit differently from other currencies, in bundles of 25 from the heart vendors and in fairly large amounts from the meteorite events.
---
Basically, it's hard to make assumptions about how easy or difficult farming the next map currency will be until we actually get to play it.
---
Also, it's kind of funny how you dismiss laurels as "not much," when 95 laurels is literally 60 days of login rewards -- if you don't have any saved up because you're new or just recently spent them them all, you're stuck behind a significant timegate without any other options. 
---
Sad that I won't be able to play LWS4 
---
There are several online retailers that sells that cards ...
---
GW2 also accepts https://www.paysafecard.com/en-us/
---
Then there are stuff like visa/mastercard virtual gift cards.
---
Sounds about right.  I typically run for around 4-5 hours and can't tag worth a damn (old CPU + poor reaction time), so I tend to think of my estimates as "minimum achievable" numbers.
---
There are a lot of icon reuse in PoF
---
usually with my keyboard and mouse.
---
I could get behind that sort of playstyle. I definitely have my "preferred element" too (it's also Water, how funny), and for the sake of rotations I mostly hop onto Air and back, or Earth and back. Fire isn't touched so much unless I'm the only one around to clean up low-level groups of enemies (when like harvesting or something).
---
If Arcane had a set duration and then pushed my back into Water at the end, I'd be far more likely to go for that. And twin pistols, I could see it being a much more mobility-friendly mid-ranged Elite specialization, something the Elementalist desperately needs.
---
I feel like while it's on your back the bowstring should be invisible since it's whole body turns into light when wielding it, would only make sense for the bowstring which is also made of light to only appear when everything else does, other than that I really like it.
---
I find the currency just right, I have found myself in need of it on occasions but never so much that I would have grind a lot for it. What do you need so much for?
---
yea looks like just a bunch of map currencies and laurels. kind of sucks for newer players then if it costs laurels.  
---
whatever material used for ascended versions is still unknown looks like.
---
Probably worth getting both. 
---
HOT has gliding. POF has mounts. The maps for HOT also has easy map farms to get trinkets. Also the raids if you are interested. 
---
Orr what?
---
Oh yeah arcane would only last for a duration but would also make you a little less glass cannny by giving you a second health pool. But maybe that’s too much
---
Well, it's still a desert, but at least not a beige one.
---
CM?
---
It was broken for me until I disabled the Disconnect extension (chrome)
---
And again for leggy weapon collection. 
---
And again for others collections. 
---
That's one happy-looking necro-salad!
---
the pack with Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire is also on sale here: https://buy.guildwars2.com/store?Action=html&amp;Locale=en_IE&amp;SiteID=gw2&amp;pbPage=heartofthorns&amp;themeID=4785548000
---
It's cheaper than buying HoT without PoF, but more expensive than buying just PoF
---
If you're buying it, buy both at once here, it's cheaper than buying HoT without PoF (but slightly more expensive than buying PoF without HoT): https://buy.guildwars2.com/store?Action=html&amp;Locale=en_IE&amp;SiteID=gw2&amp;pbPage=heartofthorns&amp;themeID=4785548000
---
They deleted the post lol:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/acnprr/no_christmas_or_new_years_sale/
---
yes. Most of the raids so far require HoT (I wanna say 5 out of 6 wings), half of the elite specs (extra gameplay customization options for each starter class, ranger can become druid for example) are locked behind HoT, and the maps themselves are (personally) more interesting to replay than the PoF maps because of the large scale map wide meta events (PoF is more about exploring and uncovering huge maps, HoT is more about dealing with lots of activity on regular sized maps)
---
As for beginner tips: Don't approach the game like it's a reskinned WoW. Pretty much forget any type of mentality that you might have picked up from playing WoW, because it is entirely a different beast. Check out the new player guide [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers) for more information
---
Decay?
---
I'm also not interested in grinding the map for the next month straight because the currency has 53 daily limit, thanks.
---
I don't think it would be, if it's a set duration (possibly with the ability to end it early, however), then it also probably comes with a sizeable cooldown of ~25-30 seconds (unlike going into and out of shroud on Necromancer/Reaper, which iirc is only 10 seconds.)
---
You enter the mode, get a little bit of the benefit from all elements at once, do your thing for maybe ~8 seconds, and then poof, back to Water attunement for you for another 25 seconds.
---
Not full mastery thought, since you don't need leyline glinding and that is the last and most expensive step.
---
It's not only GW2 tho, many games work like this, bu that usually works itself out once you install Geforce experience.
---
I think if you really like music you should not hate others for expressing their music while also do it without monetary gains. Music bots can perform better than humans, not be annoyed by concorrence and can last much longer.
---
I defend AI in everything but here is a lost battle that AI surely wins, feeding bots money will only make things worse.
---
There used to be bots on old PvP loobies playing for days straight and people gave it money unaware.
---
While you can argue people can give money to anything they want and programming is a skill just like music and it can be even harder to master to teach music to a machine than just playing music and that skill should be rewarded, it comes to a point that over time it's just the machine and not the player anymore, forever.
---
I think people need to appreciate music for what it is including the random noise of people themselves, because without it, it's just a machine trying to perform a pattern.
---
I have repeatedly considered the risk you are talking about here, even commented on it myself, but I think they're not stupid. They clearly intend to keep players at least moderately invested and simply don't want to rush an expansion out that really needs the time and dedication. At least that's how I see it. If Season 5 delivers and we maybe already get bits of information on Expac 3 thrown at us this year, I think it will work out alright in the end. 
---
But if the previous LW maps have taught us anything, then that the map currencies come most of the time from doing a mineral/gathering run and doing the 4 hearts.
---
I mean, sure, Ascended weapons shouldn't be easy to come by, but this just looks like yet another timegate instead of better content rewards. I'm already surprised they're ascended at all (looking at you Golden Fractal Weapons).
---
Except back then we had the meteor farm and everybody was swimming in rose quartz, kralkatite and liquid gold 3 days in.
---
Yeah, that is a little different though. Shaman used to crowd certain classes out of compositions (similar to Discipline Priest in Mists of Pandaria for groups focused on DPS) which is what Chronomancer does now. Blizzard fixed the issue that stopped other classes being competitive relatively quickly which Arenanet hasn't done at all.
---
Regarding the poor state of Shaman since WoD (or ever if you want to listen to the absolute Enhancement diehards that have hated it since multiple proc windfury was removed), that is more like the poor state of builds such as Reaper and Herald which have also been awful for raids for 3+ years and see far less relative usage than Ele and Enhance.
---
I didn't post an opinion. It isn't an agreement with me, it is a fact.
---
As I have stated three separate times, balance, equal footing, multiple builds being viable, multiple weapons being options.
---
You are even dumber than you put out there, which truly is an achievement.
---
If we got a sylvari legend, I think I'd rather get riannoc for greatsword.
---
&gt; But if the previous LW maps have taught us anything, then that the map currencies come most of the time from doing a mineral/gathering run and doing the 4 hearts.
---
Uh.. yeah?  How does that invalidate anything I said?
---
Exactly!! Now let’s just convince Anet
---
The purple brand crystal textures always get me
---
Barrier may help but high HP is irrelevant. These types of traps tIck for %, not fixed damage. 
---
Into itttt
---
lol @ speculation
---
I have better question: will glacial weps go up? Orchestral?
---
I'm sad I missed that meteor rush, good times...
---
Thanks for keeping us posted 👍
---
I mean, it's not like I don't agree, I just don't see why they would blatantly lie to their playerbase. They - Anet - clarified that bringing back the city is currently out of the question because they don't have the entire city, just parts of it from different iterations. 
---
Neither do I believe they intentionally deleted anything. They seem uncomfortable about not having the city anymore, so I'm sure it was an accident and that they would have saved it if it had been possible. 
---
Why do people always think game devs are too stupid to breathe...? 
---
Subscribed. 
---
Do you think it's a good idea to update your post and include the link to the card there for visibility?
---
Oh yeah, totally.  I know I would've definitely quit if I didn't have to run my slowass character back through Queensdale 100 times to do lazy story quests.  God forbid I use part of the game to make another part of the game go a little quicker.
---
It might help to know why you left the game 4 years ago. There's obviously a lot of new content, so if you enjoy the basic idea of GW2 you will probably enjoy returning. 
---
If you were a mostly WvW player, you most likely won't be happy returning. If you wanted raids, maybe you would.
---
The balloons you can craft for guild hall decorations reflect what's around them, in that slightly blurred way you would get with a shiny latex balloon. It's pretty awesome.
---
Wonder how the focus sits. Hope it floats like the new legendary and isn't just held.
---
And all the Weebs in Tyria unyuu'd in joy for we are getting a non-gemstore katana. Surprisingly I prefer non upgraded version to upgraded.
---
I am smart enough not to think myself smarter than a game dev and believing they are just stupid and lost the city because of that. There will be a good reason but since I don't work there, I do not know.
---
So I just leveled a warrior as f2p to level 80 and I wanted to ask is it worth to continue to play as a f2p in the endgame ? Cuz I can't really afford an expansion due my college and tuition expenses
---
I'm going to give anet the benefit of the doubt and think this is graphic limitations. If they make each arrow glow from barrage it would just break the game. When it comes to quality, anet does not skip out on what they make, but they just take a shit long time to make it. If they could've done it, i don't see them passing up the opportunity.
---
I especially love the detail like in that cube, you see damage on the edges. Some items have this, and scratches, and it’s my favorite kind of detail. 
---
He's just asking about what's in the expansions and deciding if it's worth returning to play them, which as it turns out, *you do have to pay for.*
---
I'm getting sick of doing shit in Glint's Lair. Idk about anyone else 
---
I hear ya...then again, I'm wondering if Steve will be similar to the "mind realm" metaphysical stuff with Mordy.
---
Something where Steve *is* the ocean...that the other dragons' corruption of the Tyrian coasts are what's keeping the continent spared from his onslaught.
---
Meanwhile down in Cantha, his waves are corrupting land creatures which are causing havoc. The main hope of holding him off residing in the Kurzicks and Luxons uniting to overthrow the ministry of purity to access the magic Shiro used to create the jade wind, and to use it to turn the Steve ocean surf to stone, to at least create a barrier to buy time...
---
Maybe there's no name because he represents The Void, and he's known by different names to different cultures. 
---
I could see that battle being the last showdown, somehow pitting the other (living) dragons' energies against water, with fire being the obvious counter directly, but kralks lightning as a powerful weapon against which Steve's minions are weak, and jormag's ice to stem the tide of the attacks.
---
Obviously it's all wild speculation, but to me it's more plausible than many of the ideas I've seen here.
---
This could also get around the need for an "underwater expansion" which honestly sounds about as appealing as a root canal. They could have large areas of land and solidified ocean with subterranean waterways connecting throughout, to include a lot of aquatic combat without everything being totally underwater.
---
there's still a lot of content for you. fyi expansions are 50% off atm
---
No, no, a million times no.  Underwater always sucks in all games.  Cameras, movement, combat, it's all horrible.  
---
I miss spoke when i said " you get very little liquid gold" i should have said you get it slowly and a little bit at a time. The general idea with liquid gold as I understand it is X thing into gold at any time, or the gold value of a item. So actual gold ie anytime a mob drops money. A single high value item ie legendary precursor or rare infusions. Lastly large quantities of a item that you can trade for gold or use as a currency to trade with players mystic coins is a good example here.
---
Do you happen to know if you can use the Amazon keys for EU too? Or is it restricted to NA accounts?
---
&gt; ice elemental in Snowblind
---
spell breaker elite is amazing there, you can cast it just before 75% hp and it will last the rest of the fight unless your team has really poor dps.
---
I had suggested Trahearne for the potential mix and unique take on some Necromancer mechanics mixed with the plant-abilities of the Sylvari. Things such as summoning (plant) minions that act as living bombs to pursue enemies for a brief duration before exploding to damage and root enemies surrounding them for a brief time would be interesting to see, in my opinion.
---
This is exactly like the stellar and astral weapons released with Istan. 
---
What the actual fucks are u talking about
---
I thought so but apparently there is something else besides the instance borders that would prevent the entire city from being properly accessible. 
---
If I find the source of their statement, I will link it here. 
---
People who are interested will continue to be interested and have their interest piqued...the ones that were not, will continue to whine and make excuses for something they don't want to do.
---
Honestly, I'd love a no glow base version. Like they it worked with Requiem armor.
---
As it stands, I wont bother with any of them.
---
Will forever be read as Phallus. I do like the burn marks and Nod Laser on draw and the projectiles. Quite nice it's not comedy like kudzu.
---
Who is teapot? *scratches head - honestly don't know.
---
It's good but lets not forget that some items and terrain still use criminally bad textures. A high quality texture pack would be nice.
---
Zevix.1479
---
Send me some in game mail to let me know it's you! I'll be on today to catch up with the living story. 
---
Oh man thank god, nothing too stupid, map currency I can get behind. I just don't like using TP instead of merchants. 
---
Most gw2 players don't watch teapot and gw2's overall viewership on twich is pretty low tbh. He might have convinced a couple people here and there though nothing huge.
---
have you ever played p/p thief?
---
You’d have to rewrite all the asura npc dialogue as 99.999% of asura was instantly want to genocide/vivisect/ignore/insult you (as a skritt). 
---
An over all summary of all the items you got would be fantastic.
---
Rev Condi DPS burning for me is too similar to Renegade. I'd prefer gs + power spec. 
---
i think its good.
---
Do story &gt; Map exploration &gt; Map Achievements &gt; Story Instance Achievements.
---
Good to just get everything unlocked and go from there.  While the map will be the "newest" for months.  It is definitely easier starting out because there will be multiple instances to get any event/map achievements done.  
---
I'm still kicking myself for deciding to take a break all through LS3.  Some smaller event achievements its almost impossible to find people doing if it isn't needed for Aurora.
---
Thanks for the quick reply.  I'll pick up both then.  Is there a specific guide that would be best to look at or just go through some of those listed? 
---
My favorite one out of these has got to be the hybrid-legend Revenant thing. That'd be sick!
---
I love the Ranger and Mesmer ones too.
---
A gw2 twitch streamer and YouTuber. Mostly does raiding videos and his teatime podcast which I enjoy somewhat, but his recent raid training video is what inspired this post.
---
You should add GW2 Navi from GW2Timer
---
&gt; Neither do I believe they intentionally deleted anything. They seem uncomfortable about not having the city anymore, so I'm sure that they would have saved it if it had been possible.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Why do people always think game devs are too stupid to breathe...?
---
I don't think game devs are too stupid to breathe, but the fact you mention they seem uncomfortable about it makes me wonder how exactly it got lost. Looks like something went down by accident. I just really can't grasp the idea someone just went "Well, probably we'll never, ever, not even in a flashback episode or fractal some kind of way will need the OG LA." [DELETE]
---
That thief spec works well in theory but idk if many groups will take it due to how tanking requires high toughness (aka low damage) and low group support would mean it would be subpar to Chrono. 
---
ok i see your point. Still i wasn't talking about that. Barrage is a pretty clear animation which show arrows on the ground. That is experience breaking. 
---
meteor shower could benefit from some rainbows from the bifrost (if it doesn't have it already) to put another example.
---
Astral wisp could use the crow projectile when using nevermore,
---
It's not like im asking for anet to change all skills in game, but just the most obvious ones. In case of the longbow there arent that many really.
---
It does. I only have 32 points and I've had this exact message a couple of times over the years including removal of rewards for a couple of days.
---
Like your ideas
---
Not sure how they would restrict it based on cosmetics but you do need to have PoF to unlock this episode. Honestly don’t think logging in once every 3 months is that big of an ask.
---
&gt; because it's exceedingly rare that you get 300 currency per day doing this, unless you're literally farming the map with all alts that you have available for 24 hours straight.
---
You have absolutely no idea what the new currency is, how it's obtained, or how much you can get per day.  Calm the fuck down.
---
Holy fuck this. Add in a crafting calculator like gw2 efficiency's and I will donate to you like no other. 
---
According to wiki, the Exquisite Burl Jewel is only used in rings, amulets and accessories. Also, the jewel only requires 5 burl each.
---
I think I'm good.
---
Yup! you sure can.
---
Did you see those warriors from the Dragonbrand? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords. 
---
There will always be one map that's best.  
---
9am PST
---
I like particle effects on weapons so long as they are reasonably tame, e.g. flames on Ascalonian weapons or ice stink cloud on Corrupted weapons. These weapons look like they might be in the same group so I'm cautiously looking forward to them.
---
Your first idea is my favorite. It would actually make me like ele

Are these wings? Can we get wings now?
---
Very nice,  in acouple months im definitely going to see about getting a commission
---
Honestly he's the only other one who I feel has a decent claim to being a "final boss". The only problem I have with him is that they twinned him with jormag and now both have to die together and that's usually not a "final boss" trait.
---
5pm UK time, 6pm in many European countries, 4pm in other European countries, 9am if you are in the same time zone as Anet.
---
Would be better if you talked less and just showed the thing
---
I think the only reason people thought this was the last episode is because the trailer really hyped up a battle against kralk, but it is definitely going to be 6
---
Im planning on making a heal herald specificly for PUG cm's+t4, but are wondering what type of gear im gonna get. this is for a comp with 2dps,1bs,1quicknessDPSfb and then the herald healer. From what i understand herald is able to give more boons then renegade. 
---
**Should i go full Harrier or full Minstrel**
---
Harrier is standard but since its for pugging (where its nice to have 1 dedicated heal) I doubt im going to do much dmg anyway. So I was thinking Minstrel would be better since it gives thoughness(7% convert to healingpower), and vit to be more tanky and with the Hardened Foundation trait + more base stat a LOT more healing power. Boon duration should still be an easy 100% inside fracs with the extra buffs. 
---
Now do a close-up of the original guild weapons...
---
By "very short" burst I mean less than one second bursts that happen mostly in Player vs Player combat. There is no sigil that is better than Air in these situations, period. Break bar "bursts" are 10-15 second long DPS windows where obviously Force+Impact combo will be better, especially that outside of the window those still provide damage amplification that is worse only versus Force+Bloodlust combo, which is not exactly realistic in most situations.
---
I really like the axes and 1H swords. They struck a nice balance between "glowy" and  simple, plus the I just dig the scimitar look. :)
---
I would recommend at least trying to farm some Winterberries now and again. You can easily get about 50 in a day, so that comes out to just 4 days, 10-15 minutes each day, to get a stat-selectable ring. I never realized how easy it was until I started farming them for Aurora.
---
I'd love to see what the armor/map designers could do with a better engine.
---
&gt;... for free to those who already have the respective expansion, ...
---
You don't actually need any expansion to receive a chapter for free, all it takes is logging in to a character, works even on a f2p account. However, you do need the respective expansion (and a lvl 80 character) to be able to play the chapter. 
---
Forget the item, imagine if any of the Ascended upgrades cost more than 2g. People will lose their shit.
---
I thought the delete button meant to delete entire post and comment thread,sorry. Anyways,I just don't want any more replies to this post please and thank you. I simply don't care about this post anymore because I got PoF.
---
I heavily doubt that they will use a jewel which has a recipe that is HoT exclusive for PoF LS episodes....
---
Tell me with a straight face waiting over 3 months for both sandswept islers and kourna was worthwhile. 
---
&gt; Which is what the new technologies and restructures from last May will likely address.
---
They also said HoT was coming with a full set of gen 2 legendaries, but those still aren't done. Look at release dates and tell me the amount of content which GW2 turns out isn't slowing down...
---
Or don't, just keep whiteknighting and realise in 2019 we'll have at best 4 living story episodes and it'll be a /huge/ improvement over the 3 of this year - and only because they get to start right in januari.
---
I'm in almost the exact same situation. For Christmas I upgraded my years-old non-gaming laptop to a similar level desktop PC. Hot damn.

I'm glad you replied this twice. Once here and once on youtube.

Otherwise, I'm glad you copy comments.

Also think before you speak. He didn't open all keys recently, look at the video starts with 100 keys. 
---
Yeah...I miss the days when GW2 wasn't looking like your average korean MMORPG-clone but had a distinct, western feel to it. 
---
Now everything is just spikes and/or glitter with baby-pink or baby-blue hues or fire. 
---
I would love to see some stuff that would fit into western fantasy again. Less glow, more detail. 
---
Challenge Mote, to activate a hard mode for the fractal.

In open world, you do you
---
In t4, scrapper has some utility for stealth skips (Twilight Oasis, molten boss) and some decent defensive utility with bulwark gyro (stab+damage reduction) or condi cleanse (purge gyro, pairs well with purity of purpose), but is generally not quite helpful enough to warrant replacing a different healer or support
---
Staff core ele and staff tempest would like a word with you.
---
You're getting sick of going a place we went to twice in the plot, with this being the third time, over the course of 5 years?
---
It's round in hexadecimal. 400.
---
Just logging in is fine.
---
They're talking about the Elegy - Requiem Sigil of Nullification situation and equating it to the Dragonsblood weapons.
---
Yeah, that. Citadel Bombardment. As I said, it seems to pull the projectiles from the legendary, even though it is an area skill.  Unless, for whatever reason, it treats the actual arrows in that longbow skill as part of the area circle itself, which is why it doesn't update?
---
On behalf of all our team at GuildMag, thank you for the kind words. Enjoy! :)
---
Nothing more than what you're doing. I also run the game at high/ultra + reshade. I can post my reshade config if you're interested.
---
Do you mind Sharing the Last ingredient That is unknown so far? Or was the Item given to you?
---
This is Ad Infinitum (my very first legendary)
---
&gt;but all about mentality.
---
yep pretty much this
---
Do not play heal Herald, play heal Renegade. The whole point of the FB/Ren comp is to cover chrono buffs, and Herald access to alacrity is really poor. Herald coverage of miscellaneous boons is better, but with FB covering quickness and fury you only need to cover alac and might, and Ren is much better at those two. Additionally, Ren heal is an incredibly strong group heal and the elite is a substantial DPS increase for the group.
---
For gear, run whatever you want. If you are not comfortable on harrier, then just run minstre, as the damage difference is minimal.
---
HYPE
---
TIL Aquatic Ruin is everybodys most hated thing in the game.  
---
I wish it wasnt laurel requirement but something else or at least significantly lower. A very huge time gate for people that doesnt have laurels and you can only get it by logging in which should not be something you just force on the players. Little rewards for logging in is nice but it should not required for new content.
---
Gotcha. I didn't look at the page history. I've just seen enough stuff like this in alpha to believe it could be. I never believed it would be a reward on release mind you. I did believe that on the alpha server a dev could do something like this, because I've seen stuff like this done before.  Thanks for the heads up.
---
For years when i make squads i only ask for exp.
---
Sure from time to time theres a new guy but so what? Explain something. Raids always work out just fine like that cause li means nothing. Can have 1k li but never played a druid role, that wont make you a good healer. People indeed need to stop asking for hundreds of li or kp, it is ridiculous.
---
No one spec can be good for everything. You're absolutely correct about the weaknesses - and given it's a throw-away concept, it likely would been way too much development to be worth suggesting seriously, but I like the concept itself.
---
Rather than being purely selfish, it could simply have non-heal support. Perhaps in the form of easy and efficient might, fury and quickness uptimes. That way, another defensive-focused support could be added on, and split the tasks down the middle.
---
Lots of ways to do it.
---
A very very close up shot of Ad Infinitum, the Fractal legendary backpiece.
---
they dont really need stuff, bags and maybe low level food and utilities so they can level faster, most just want to have something to do, honestly most of what i get asked is "what do i do?" arena net level locked the personal story and it just leaves them clueless on what to do, they dont understand, they have to run around randomly for 10 levels, really wish arenanet would change it back so story was right away
---
They wont, they will make the same with stellar weapons in ls 4.1, add new resources. 
---
Cauliflower time!
---
I expect they're a component animation, rather than actual projectiles being calculated on the fly, yes.
---
If you can, try throwing a few barrages, and see if you notice a set pattern in how the arrows land. Chances are even if it looks random, the ground circle is simply being rotated a random amount to make it look that way.
---
I haven't seen a video for Hunter's Ward (similar wind up, cast animation, and falling arrows effect to barrage), but I completely expect that's an identical thing; wind up and casts using legendary projectiles, arrow falls being standard Dragonhunter animations because it's not a 'projectile' in the game code.
---
Sweet. Digital Version!
---
Totally agree with you there :)
---
Oh, tell you what..give me your account name, I'll send you gold for 1 set. 
---
Of course its fractals, every cool thing is always locked behind group content that I have neither time or friends to obtain.
---
If you already have the harrier gear on hand, you might as well give it a try. If you are having issues, minstrel may be worth it.
---
I like how you're bitching about build diversity when there's arguably more of it now than there ever was. "The more options there are the better" is also not an objective fact, because if it was the case then why did arenanet decide years ago to reduce the amount of trait options we have to streamline them as elite specializations in 2015? Why do you think they removed the ability to select exactly how many trait points you could allocate towards certain traitlines in 2014? They have progressively reduced the amount of options we had for build diversity over the years up until HoT and PoF. Their reasoning was because that giving people that much freedom resulted in people taking things that were just plain bad / pointless because they didn't understand and felt overwhelmed. But no! To you it isn't an opinion it's a fact right? Lmfao.
---
I also find it amusing how you tell me that I'm dumb yet you chose to engage in a comment chain with me claiming repeatedly that I apparently don't want build diversity, yet I've typed probably a dozen times that I said nothing of the sort.
---
If it wasn't for the fact that you're able to type legibly, I would honestly have a hard time telling you apart from a smooth-brained neanderthal.
---
They could charge out the ass for everything and they'd be well within their right, I just don't like how arbitrary this content restriction is (part of getting the expansion is getting the accompanying episodes). Not a big deal, just something I don't like.
---
Are they adding some hidden buffs while you are trying out your class in silverwastes (before accepting boosts). While trying guardian in silverwastes my damage was about twice as much as when I came back later after accepting lvl 80 boost. 
---
True that, but new players won't have the 'ability' to carry themself in unknown territory like this, even if you watch/read encounter guides.
---
As a veteran sure, but new players won't have the same experience (talking from experience).
---
\&gt;85 laurals
---
Me being an intellectual, just spend 380 on tier 6 bags to make a legendary.
---
Ed Orr Wilburrrrr (dear gods that's an ancient joke NOBODY is going to get)
---
I'd love to see a true Minion Master necro. Not sure what the weapon would be. One of the bows, maybe? Not sure Anet will ever make something like an elite spec with as high a skill floor as Minions, sadly. 
---
Pistol/Rifle Elementalist would be awesome. I'd love a high DPS Ele with less piano playing than Weaver. I loved my staff elementalist main, but it just got too exhausting to play Weaver for someone at my skill level.
---
I'm not sure what I'd like for my Engineer. Holosmith hits a great balance of high damage, survivability, and engaging gameplay without being TOO difficult. Personally, I like the idea of a minion Engineer, but I'd rather have one for Necro. I see others asking for support alchemist, but I could imagine a condition damage Engi with off-hand torch.
---
sigh i think it's pointless to make my capt america off that. 1h pistol 1h shield
---
=(
---
If we're genuinely going to kill Kralk in a Living World episode, it needed more than one episode of buildup from the point we ended at last time. If you'd told me we were going to fight Kralk this episode I'd have immediately assumed we'd fail; if the fight's next episode, it could go either way.
---
Could this also have been influenced by the fact that some people assumed that a 1k AP account pinging some kp (because I guess you didn't join a Dhuum group before getting some other kills on the account) was probably an alt? I'm asking this because that would my 1st reaction when someone joins with very low AP, especially if they talk in chat before entering the raid instance :p (for an account closer to 4-5k AP then I'd probably think it's a beginner)
---
I'm pretty sure the devs know nobody wants a primarily underwater episode or expansion. In no game I've ever played have I thought "Wow, that underwater level was my favorite!"
---
Now if only we were able to see anything at all without all the particle effects
---
it took sweet time to get them into game,like 3 years?
---
Spartan.6318
---
You really don’t have to do that, like I said it’s gonna be a while before I even need the set. If you send me the money now I’m just going to use it to buy bigger bags XD
---
Wanted to say this.
---
I have basically not even touched sandswept isles or kourna since they came out and buffing rewards in those maps seems more than reasonable.
---
Some of them look like clones of the Mystic Weapons sets with slight alterations. The swords are nice, but everything else is really disappointing.
---
I think a whole expansion is probably too much, but like half a LW season of Aquaman-style underwater maps would be perfect.
---
Give us a mastery that lets us powerswim like Aquaman and give us some Atlantis-style kingdom to zoom around. Plus like a shark mount or a squid mount with fun abilities, races.
---
Throw in a Shatterer sized world boss that you can swim around and attack from all angles.
---
Like three mostly underwater maps with mounts/movement masteries would be perfect and then it would be time to move on.
---
It's almost as if this was a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game and not a single player offline role playing game.
---
Right? I knew it wasn't loved, but I didn't realize the intensity with which everyone hates it.
---
The guy guarding the premium place in dr would like to have a word with you
---
Yeah, it's fucking unfair. I can't believe anet would add rewards for people who put in more effort than us. Gw2 was always advertised as a casual game, but I can't even beat story missions alone nowadays. And then there aren't even any legendary rewards like in group content. Anet HATES us.
---
I said I didn’t want a cynical cookie overdose.
---
Hope it leans more towards that than Jahai. I feel like I can't get much mistonium at all running around. 
---
Great that I spend all my laurels yesterday....
---
It's the Gem Aura Outfit.
---
Please.
---
It was unlocked for showcasing purposes. I have no idea about the recipe.
---
Ele Attunement mechanic for mesmer. Lost weapon swap capability Domi, Inspiration, Chaos, Illusions for the different attunements. 
---
Don't think something like this would happen because anet would end up having making different weapon skills for everything for mesmer.
---
The video is literally my thoughts on it though... Me talking is the point of it &gt;.&gt;
---
The trailer didn't do it justice. I wasn't even on highest settings for this video I think, forgot to turn them up &gt;.&gt;
---
What mount and how do I get it?
---
You can buy limited use karma tools as well.
---
They wouldn't need to use entire city and they probably wouldn't anyway considering how small Mistlock Observatory is.
---
Such VIP pass instance would be built around old Mystic Forge location; it would have crafting stations on north (prob. rearranged to save the space), bank spot would be the same, trading post hall could be used to hold more NPC services, Lion statue would be a bonus area for people to hang out. It's enough for people who need pirate Lion's Arch to be satisfied, I believe
---
1) 80
---
2) eh...depends who you ask. I don't really do it much so I'm not really the best person to ask but... There are 2 PvP systems
---
a) sPvP: 5v5 arena matches where you're fighting for control of 3 points
---
b) WvW: large scale 3-way battles between 3 servers to take control of 4 separate maps
---
sPvP doesn't have a huge highly competitive playerbase anymore so you do tend to find a lot of the same people in high ranks, and there are some balance issues, but it's fun enough to do in small quantities. 
---
3) sPvP has normalized gear, so as long as you're wearing clothes and have the weapon equipped, then you have the same tier stats as everyone else
---
WvW uses the PvE gear, so it's about as difficult to get as any other gear
---
4) no, not really, can be done within a week if you really want. The important things to remember are
---
a) everything gives exp, exploration, events, hearts, crafting, etc.
---
b) there's no real high level exp spike that you need to overcome. The push from 60 to 61 is only slightly easier than the push from 61 to 62, and so on and so forth
---
5) For what role and which mode? 
---
Why would we do that in the 2nd last chapter?
---
&gt;new players
---
Well, that's the point where your arguments fail. 
---
You need 5 laurels per weapon, 85 laurels for all of them. After only 7 days, you arleady have 11 laurels. That's one weapons plus the insignia recipe. 
---
After 21 days, you have 31 laurels -&gt; 5 weapons. And after 28 days, you have 55 laurels -&gt; 10 weapons.
---
Also, as a **new** player, you obviously won't start with these weapons. You start with leveling, playing the personal story, get your first exotic equipment and so on. Probably you also do LS2, Hot, LS3, PoF and the previous LS4 storys first or look for other interesting skins. 
---
That means, as a new player it takes time to go through all the "new player" stuff, and at the moment you reach the point, where you want to craft these weapons, you will already have enough laurels to buy them. 
---
So your "problem" is no *new player problem* and it's also no *WoW player problem*, it's actually no problem at all. 
---
The *only* people with "disadvantages" are ppl like me, who spend their laurels and don't have enough left to buy all weapons now. 
---
But that actually no real problem or disadvantage, because we spend our laurels and got other stuff for that. 
---
Last time I tried to play gw2 on my igpu (with my graphic card pulled out), it barely worked on settings close to minimal, with black xera platforms and fun stuff like that. I don't really know what can you be talking about. It isn't something you can miss.
---
I never expected this to happen in episode 5, but I had people challenge me and insisting in the past that just like LS3, EP5 will be the "climax" and Episode 6 the aftermath and link to LS5. 
---
I get what you mean, i hate that ive bought both hot and pof and yet i still can't access s2 or s3 episodes from before i started playing. There's a lot of story, maps, and equipment for the expacs im locked out of bc i don't have much money. Kinda sucks when you've already paid for the game itself multiple times. 
---
Max level is 80
---
There are 2 types of PvP, sever vs server vs server open warfare called World vs World. Your level and gear matters here. Ascended gear (and Legendary) is best in class.
---
Then there is Structured PvP. Your level and Gear do not matter here. You fight 5v5 in a combat arena with king of the hill style of play. This used to be part of the eSports scene. It’s build and skill base so you can’t out gear someone here.
---
Leveling in this game is way easy in all three game modes. PvE you just do anything for XP for either PvP you will get Tomes of Knowledge  as you play that level you up
---
I was really hoping to have an episode where I wasn't surrounded by purple crystals.
---
Excluding the PC’s awko stance. I feel the characters are on point. 
---
&gt; As far as the scenery is concerned, I'm not that enthusiastic about seeing yet more environments doomed to be Branded forever when we already have... four, five? zones that are 10% or more covered in purple crystals.
---
100% agree.  So tired of "that old place from GW1 you liked, but now with purple crystals" maps.
---
You can't just snark away the fact that he's right.
---
For me at the end it is: realize new episode is coming out and I still have to finish achievements on the old map. Rush to old map every day to finish. 50 mistonium away from finishing the armor collection 👀 I can do it before the patch hits. 
---
&gt;Rox's face
---
oof
---
What do you mean by which role and which mode? I always used to play "Rogue" or "Assasin" classes kind of but I also like rangers, I always liked the more high DPS classes.
---
World vs World? Wow that sounds nice, is it like open world and you just go and kill someone? You don't need to accept any kind of duel or something? Also, what's the most popular server?
---
I love thief so ill throw some of my ideas:
---
Greatsword:
---
Samurai like thief! Moveset that builds more around counters and blocking, can be a more tanky like spec.(will actually make you play like a samurai, waiting for thw right moment to strike while observing your oppoment)
---
I really loved the warrior counter system and can see how it can be even more intersting to build something around it.
---
And ofcourse, a samurai that uses shadow magic to fight side by side with a dragon AGAINST A DRAGON!
---
if thats not cool i dont know what is.
---
Focus/scepter:
---
A trickster caster like build that has more ccs and util then dps,(puppeter control/aoe blind on mobs etc)
---
You can get a "joker from batman" feel from this one.
---
Spear on land!:
---
Can be quite intersting to see something like this; evasion and dots come alot with this one.
---
Lastly, i think it can be incerdibly epic to have the elite spec to be somehow related to aurene, and have us get the spec from the living world story.
---
God its so fun talking about these stuff! 
---
So many cool ideas here, luv u guys =D
---
Ooft, im glad i always read the comments before the articles first. Thanks for the heads up.
---
The second as well. Just retrait into tempest xx2 and take eye of the storm and rush through
---
80 then mastery up to 200 something or maybe 3 idr
---
spvp no, wvw yes
---
spvp no, wvw for one class no, for multiple classes possibly depending how precise you care to be
---
spvp it changes seasonally with balance updates and depends on what you are best at and know how to play and what’s being played, wvw depends what scale you are playing at. 
---
I played a lot of spvp in this game, I personally don’t recommend it. I recommend wvw. Do as much pve as you care to do, for me I played through the core story, the living world seasons in order, hots, and pof story lines and that was enough for me. I don’t raid or play fractals that much, but getting into fractals is good if you like it because gettting up to t4 and working on it gives you something to do, same with raids. 
---
I recommend playing every class to learn how they all work and feel, and check out the elite specialization from hots and pof to see those. For instance guardian goes from dps in core game to support in pof. But that being said, there’s only so much of a thing as dps/support, and if your interested in pvp/wvw it’s probably good to just learn all of the classes anyways. 
---
Gearing your first 80: buy best gear to your level off the trading post while doing map completion to level to your next story instance, make sure you gather everything, keep those gathering tools stocked, keep some salvage kits, buy the basics. You can right click the salvage kit stack to salvage all. 
---
Enjoy making your character look better because that’s going to get you a lot more fun then getting better stat gear, as gear isn’t the main point of the game really. 
---
You can message me for more specific questions, I just happened to rant here for a bit. 
---
Pve power reaper already slots 3/5 utilities, including elite, with pet skills. 
---
Yeah that’s part of the challenge :)
---
What time is the update tomorrow?
---
The music 😍
---
Oh I see thank you so much with the help with classes, last question, I see people saying that they like more WvW PvP and my question is are there different WvW servers or only 1? if there are more than 1 which one is the most popular one?
---
Worst part is that https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragonsblood_Spear already exists. Disappointed that this isnt the staff skin.
---
Agreed - if you compare the healing values on rev skills to that of, say, druid, the healing multipliers for rev are crazy. Combined with the additional healing effectiveness multipliers in Salvation traits, you can do tons of healing even without speccing as much into healing power.
---
you can't do both?
---
Phrasing...
---
As someone who got a 144hz monitor and a 1080ti, i hate myself playing this game. Can only get up to 70fps if there is no one around and i'm staring at the ground. Framerate goes to the shitter at completely random times. It's not like i have a bad cpu either: Ryzen 5 2600X.
---
I really wish they spent more time working on the engine and optimization instead of only new content like the path of exile team, cause this game would be way way more beautiful at a higher framerate.
---
I’m glad the raiding scene is getting more love from both new players and veterans. It seems the whole toxic elitist mindset is far less prominent than many posts suggest, although it obviously will still be there in some PUG groups. Maybe Anet can make a new raid by episode 6 with a refreshed player base
---
Awesome! This kinda of stuff makes me wish I could work on masteries on my alts again. 
---
When the trailer showcased the weapon, it actually looked a lot worse than it does now. I was pretty triggered when the sound affect was just a dragonhunter longbow sound. This is way better than what I was expecting, and will go perfectly with a new look I was planning on putting on my DH
---
[Hello fellow ancient person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyuIf76WrXo)
---
I appreciate you not wearing any other glowy things to let us experience the bow only.
---
Rare find. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjomCMIk4PA
---
This one is my fav :'D 
---
Players: "Instabilities suck, give us new stuff!"
---
ANet: *makes new instabilities*
---
Players: [dismayed Pikachu face]
---
So what's the best profession for LB? Because you know my main RANGER is pure melee meta. Like wtf. 
---
Sure can play off meta but that's just dumb. Is there meta LB? 
---
[Here ya go!](https://pastebin.com/MqLJnNUM)
---
It needs a unique damage modifier for the team, basically a 10% damage modifier + 100 meaningful stat bonus. If it could be like the druid where it has pulsing stab or extra burning, then all the more powers to it, current meta does not need a defensive healer unless it is a secondary healer with tons of barrier and utility. 
---
Quality takes time. Especially with code. 
---
I write FB/Chrono in LFG, and than, if we get a Chrono, I stay on my druid, if I get a FB, I'll relog my rev
---
I got it! \o/
---
Glad you enjoy that legendary as much as I do :D
---
Which makes no sense because if you were ever to compare to what they've done in the past, it would be to the Astral Stellar skins which barely affected the market. If anything the rose quartz farming that they hotfixed immediately shook the market the most out of that update.
---
It's mindless, unproductive, and baseless inflammatory complaining to say the same thing with Elegy will happen. Elegy armor is clearly a different content type and a content type that they haven't really rolled out before considering the parallel progression with Sun's Refuge and the step-by-step progression that was meant to be accessible for everyone unlike Legendary Armor. 
---
The Dragonsblood weapons will CLEARLY follow the content type previously established without problem with Astral/Stellar weapons. 
---
That should make it clear.
---
Yeah I don't know why this subreddit has such a fetish for telling new players to rank up their 1st character naturally. They might get bored of the game before they even get to level 80. The content they have access to before they reach 80 is honestly just lack luster and not representative of the GW2 typical game play. 
---
It's sort of the same thing, unfortunately, depending on how you look at it.
---
The biggest complaint I hear about fractals as someone who doesn't do them is that Instabilities are awkward, and punishing rather than fun.
---
So unless ANet were going to completely remove them, or fully rework them, adding new ones was probably the best option.
---
Neat idea but sadly not a great choice since it's a spoiler.
---
Fine, it will be available for free but entirely dyed permafrost.
---
Then a Black Lion Old Lion's Arch Dye Remover Upgrade will be sold for 4k gems. Everyone wins!
---
Yeah, entirely possible - though I wonder what it would be, if not a unique buff, since there are a lot of those already. Perhaps give it access to auras and aurashare to be closer to unique? If done right, could combo well with tempest.
---
I actually remember doing a quest from personal story that had us defeat risen in the mystic forge location along with parts of the bank and crafting space. We couldn't access the trading post so they'll probably have to add that in somewhere else. But all they pretty much need to do is add that instance in and a bit of the statue, and I'll be pretty happy. 
---
I've seen Squads that asked for 750 LI and the whole run was a giant clownfiesta. While LI atleast mean SOMETHING (it's at the very least better than checking for AP, which has been done a long time ago...), there is a point where groups really should stop increasing requirements.
---
character player limit to low, it doubles your frames on crowded places, i have everything else on high-ultra and a good reshade preset
---
No it does not work like that. It is personal, everything is personal. Loot, gathering nodes, kills (there is no kill steal) and so on. You can also not try to level a low lever character in a higher area. It is punnishing the low level with less xp and hard to even get a hit on a mob.
---
So you can party together without being worried you wont get the loot, the nodes or the kill. They are yours if you loot the mob, hit the mob and gather the same nodes.
---
Actually it's still available, if one plays the Personal Story some instances are in old LA.
---
On the other hand Kessex Hills is ruined forever but you don't see me whining about it.
---
Hm i've been working my way in accumulating wealth .. was in the top 40% a month ago, now in the top 33%. My goal is to reach 25% by february. 
---
I rarely see any devs around anymore. Lucky you!
---
Well been searching for Aurora only videos. Tough find. Debating building it 
---
You barely shower it. Stood still a lot. Could've moved and drew/stowed a lot more. 
---
I could show you ingame if you wanna, add Enaretos.8079 and ping if you see me in Mistlock :)
---
thx i will try yours soon
---
Most of what you're saying, I did. You can press pause if you need to check out the footfalls. Tekkit also made a showcase, and so did 2 french channels, if you're keen on checking for further details.
---
There is an issue with that. Due to the linking system servers moves up and down. Some servers are more steady and manage even with low pop links whilst others crash to the bottom if they get such. Some servers have night cover, others do not, some servers aim for only fighting and dont give a crap if they loose things. Other aim for only ppt and care about loosing and avoid fights and then there are tons of inbetween. 
---
It also depends on if you play in EU or NA. If we know that we can give you pointers. Check on youtube for videos. There is a ocean of them to watch and also check some of the pvp videos as well so you can make your own opinion about it.
---
2 parts to that question
---
1) conventional MMO questing isn't really a thing here. We have what are called hearts, which act kind of like quests, and events, which are repeating occurrences that happen either on a timer, or are triggered by someone doing something near by. The hearts are...kind of tedious, but they act as a good introduction for new players who aren't used to the event system.
---
2) any thing that's part of map completion (doing hearts, hero points, exploration) gives solo rewards, so you get the rewards for finishing a heart quest only. If your friends wants the reward too, he should do the heart quest with you. But any event that you both participate in, you'll get rewards proportional to the amount you helped (3 tiers, gold, silver, bronze). You actually don't even have to be in a party to do that, anyone on the map can pop in and help you finish an event and you'll all get full participation. And same with loot rewards, everyone who participates gets full loot, so there's no fighting over gear. Note: this also means that if you finish an event without your friend there, he won't get participation for the event
---
I really want this with and underwater mount like a shark.     
---
What do you mean by new technologies and restructures? Can you elaborate?
---
1. It's 80 but cap level is just the beginning. You have 2 extra specs per class and profession and these all require a hefty amount of time to master if you're a casual.

2. Combat is decent in my opinion but this really depends on your preference of what good is. This game's main focus is on the spec and traits. Depending on what you want to do you can build yourself to be decent or great especially if your class is made for it. There are world vs world and pure pvping maps. I prefer wvw because I suck at minor scale fighting. My play-style is built more to see the situation and fill in when needed so I see myself more useful in a big scale fight.
---
3. In pvp your gears are synced but in wvw you use the gear you have from the general map. To get these it require time but PvE wise..just getting the gears of MP is good enough to go through the story.
---
4. Its not hard at all. It depends on how often you play. Some people can get it in a few days. Some takes weeks. Some-like me took years. lol
---
5. There is no best class..there is only the better player.
---
The game is free..just try out the game. See how you like and then buy the content to get the goodies. I barely play this game but the story is really good and I always buy it to support the company.
---
Pause blurs 
---
Keys are not region locked. You could even switch between EU and NA down the road if you wanted to.
---
Want the original video file? I have it and could upload tbh, if that helps you out.
---
Unfortunately I cannot. MO made a forum post around May regarding episode 3 mentioning behind-the-door restructures for better cadence, things he said we wouldn’t notice per se. I’ll see if I can find the post again!
---
Why you gotta make such a fuss then, geez...
---
You do realize being a clusterfuck is the goal...right?
---
Carapace Heavy legs, truly JPG experience
---
With 26 LI you would be better off not pinging it at all.
---
There's a big difference between trying to join a 300LI group with 200 than joining a 150 with 26. You are not experienced yet. Even if all that LI came from one specific wing, you would barely be considered experienced on those bosses.
---
Being able to play multiple different roles is also a huge benefit, but you are currently at the point where you should still be doing training runs or semi exp runs if you think you are comfortable on the wing.
---
For experienced runs you also need to be able to perform every single special role related to your role.
---
Well originally Reaper was able to dish out quite respectable condi dps, but after several nerfs to the condi traits it really became a mostly power focused spec.
---
Never pvp the last week of ranked. My 2 star gold went all the way down to silver. 
---
For me it's because literally every person I know who boosted got overwhelmed even with me helping and ended up quitting within a few days.
---
I recommend not boosting not because I think Core is somehow better (I Don't) but because I've seen more success with less things thrown in New players faces at once.
---
Found the post https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/41775/season-4-episode-3-is-on-the-horizon/
---
&gt; With the amount of gameplay and breadth of content in Living World, we noticed that we had an opportunity to make some adjustments to how we approach developing each episode that will help us hit our quality standards more consistently. This logistical change has had some short-term “cost” in time, but will provide benefits to all Living World episodes moving forward.
---
I'd pick up Ele right away if their next elite spec was getting bow!
---
Finish story, read reddit posts about story being too difficult.
---
u/Ajm235 just pinging since i wanna know if it was me xD
---
where?
---
I can't agree with people?
---
Actual engineer overhaul instead of stupid bandaid in the form of elite spec.
---
You'll have a green star icon above your minimal where rewards normally are.
---
&gt; Is there meta LB?
---
WvW pew pew ranger.
---
You just sound very angry man. Get a beer, relax, enjoy the previews you get, because that's not a norm, and have a good night.
---
&gt; Actually, it's the opposite
---
This is in reply to which one of my points? 
---
&gt; The design of old LA was included in multiple trailers and it was present in the released game, only to be removed later. The laws regarding games might be vague, but from customer's point of view re-adding the city as an additional, paid content would be questionable.
---
The only question the customer would have to ask is whether or not they wanted to buy this new hypothetical "time capsule gadget".   There are not any laws or even morale issues that would come up if this came to pass. 
---
&gt; Whether re-adding it again requires additional resources is none of our business
---
Nobody said this was our business.  It's clearly ANET's.  Our business is deciding whether or not we want to but the product.   
---
&gt; is literally agreeing to being scammed.
---
If a customer knows what they are buying and agrees to it, that is clearly not a scam.  
---
I'd love to see dual Pistols on the Mesmer as well. But daggers would be interesting. A distortion, illusion weapon based spec with massive health draining skills like we had in GW1. 
---
I used to use a build like that back in the day in one of the PvP maps (Jade Quarry, Kurzick4lyf) and it was so much fun. It focused on damage negation while pushing out degenerative debuffs and whittling away at health using Illusionary Weaponry to give flat-rate damage to a pair of daggers, causing them to be unblockable as well.
---
We've had a focus on wells and  acrobatic clone farming, but I'd love to see the Hex side of Mesmers return. 
---
I wonder if we’ll fight Kralk on the top of a peak or something
---
Really? I never did WvW. Fractals and pvp. Time to try something new. Thanks! 
---
Please buff DH longbow in pve arenanet! I'll shove gems at you if you do since I'll have to make the longbow then.
---
It's pretty fun. It's a roaming, burst build but it's excellent at what it does and has pretty much always been meta and strong.
---
There are few feelings in this game that are as good as sniping dead the commander of a 50 people squad.
---
I'm so hyped there's tears in my eyes! 
---
Astral/Stellar wasn't promoted as an "upgradable weapon set", while both Elegy/Requiem and Dragonsblood are. Plus, Elegy is more recent, and ArenaNet has a bad habit of completely ignoring older designs when they've made something newer.
---
So firstly, no, it is not clear that Dragonsblood will follow the Astral/Stellar. Secondly, it is very far from nonsensical to think it *might* follow Elegy/Reqiuem.
---
Thirdly, [the german site preview](https://guildnews.de/galerie-zu-den-drachenblut-waffen/)  shows that it follows **neither** (which is very much like ArenaNet). Unlike Elegy/Reqiuem where it's obtained via achievement then crafting using old materials, and unlike Astral/Stellar that is obtained after a time-gated achievement and buying recipes for map-specific currency using map-specific materials, it seems that we're able to buy recipes for volatile magic and laurels, and the crafting requires map-specific materials.
---
And doing some rough math it would actually save money buying this sale and strait up buying the gems. Awesome!
---
No, that would be an overhaul
---
It's not like the [options](https://i.imgur.com/GrHt8PY.jpg) aren't there...most people simply don't make humanoids females to not drool over their pixel boobs and "skin". There's a lot more sexually frustrated players than you think.
---
I think we’re definitely going to fight Kralk this episode. Whether we succeed idk, but I’m almost positive we’ll make an attempt atleast.
---
It's also possible that we *do* kill it this episode, and 6 is an epilogue. I mean, they're dropping a lot of hints  - the episode name and its comparison to Victory or Death, the Commander's speech from the trailer, the fact that the last episode was buildup, preparation and tracking of Kralk, that we already went through the heroic sacrifice that's supposed to motivate us, that everyone including the Pact Marshal is back for All or Nothing... and, if the article is to be believed, &gt;!the fact that the opening mission has you getting a new dragonsblood spear. Oh, and the Forge is a "staging ground" for the final assault. It's not a temporary shelter like Sun's Refuge - whoever's there is literally preparing to imminently kill an Elder Dragon. !&lt;
---
I'd say it feels a bit abrupt, but all the pieces are in place, essentially. If they don't get used now, and instead we get another "oh, we must get *the thing* to weaken Kralk," and then the next episode takes place in Janthir or wherever, it would feel a bit filler-ish. The abruptness is just due to the fact that Zhaitan had the Personal Story, and Mordremoth got an entire season and an expansion before its demise. It could be argued that Kralkatorrik is the "big bad" of PoF + Season 4, but much of its runtime we were focusing on Balthazar and Joko, so...
---
There's also the possibility that we are, indeed, going to have the final fight with Kralk at the end of this episode... and we'll lose. Episode 6 could be a bit more somber than just a follow-up/side story, like the Orr episode in S3 was.
---
Simple reason: there is so much stuff to do, to achieve, so many milestones the game will hardly be boring for you anytime soon. And all that with no feel like you have to farm.
---
Thats my experience after playing a couple of months. Ive also returned after 4 years pause
---
Make Alacrity a selfish boon, please.
---
I frequent this thread and the new posts to this subreddit and there are a whole lot of posts of people that boosted right away and are totally lost. They often complain about lack of tutorials. Basically, I see it as if you have to ask, you probably are better off not boosting. An experienced mmo player would be fine boosting, but they are not very likely to ask the question on here in the first place.
---
Boo hoo someone doesn't like your video. Whips out the passive aggression then fucks off. 
---
There was no passive aggressive tone. If you feel that way, it comes from you. I put out content on my free time and you're free to dislike it. But if I make a nice gesture your way to try and solve your issue, and then get met with a flat no, that doesn't feel ok.
---
Hence why I simply said you sounded mad. Which I reiterate.
---
You have to buy them with gems in the gemstore (can convert gold, so it's still "free", but time consuming).
---
The cost aint too high on just an episode, but getting it free is always better.
---
If logging in everyday for possibly 20 seconds a day is a grind. You haven't played many other MMOs because it requires little to no effort (which isn't considered a grind). I think the word you're wanting is time gated if you're absolutely at 0 laurels. I agree with the daily logins though.
---
Probably also map currency (and volatile magic). That's how plaguedoctor's stuff worked in Kourna, if I'm not mistaken. Exotic inscription/insignias could not be crafted, you needed to buy them from merchants for 1250 VM + 25 map currency per piece. Basically, "if you want the new stat combo, do a whole lot of the new map."
---
They are very easy from Hearts though. One of the easiest hearts (S3E6 have the fastest I believe).
---
Top reason would be that you can buy both expacs for 24.99 Euro direct from GW2 webside. It is on sale until 14 th January.

just experiment, for pve any build is viable
---
He has been posting vids on youtube about it, had an article in the most recent edition in guild mag and is not the only one talking about this. 
---
In almost every podcast he hosts that topic is brought  up and the sitution is discussed. It has been reaching out to people I believe. 
---
From player position we can only guess what part of pirate Lions Arch is accessible but my guess is, since it is possible to enter that city via personal story instance that whole map is used but sliced into what's only needed for instance purposes. 
---
Anyway, [here's what I think could be included](https://i.imgur.com/Y6xkCGB.jpg). Rest would be working like map border does - pushing players away and have some fog/fractal mists design to implicate that this place isn't real or whatever else this VIP would require.
---
They look awesome, i'm doing daily clears again starting tomorrow for the first time since i got 250 essences and realized i didn't like the infusion 
---
&gt; i'm doing the same.   
---
85 laurel means 85 t6 bag. sine each one grants more or less 60 silver in mats this is 51 gold in mats.   
---
i'm crafting sharur atm . those weapons can wait. 
---
Lol? I have to accept an offer or I'm an angry person? Want to suck my dick or spend time downloading and watching something you dont want to see? 
---
Confused. I don't play renegade but what weapons do you recommend then if sword isn't good? Want to learn it in the future.
---
Could have said "no thanks" instead of a flat rebuttal. I see it's pointless to talk as you're on the defensive. Just have a good night man, it's ok.
