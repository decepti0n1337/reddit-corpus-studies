Personally, I like how we didn't get a new problem by the end of it. things have been snowballing since S2 with every new Season or Expansion making the problem of magic worse and worse. If Bubbled killed Kralk, it would just replace the world-ending dragon with an even stronger world-ending dragon. After doing that for so long, it can be hard to take it seriously. Also, the opportune time for Bubbles to pop up would have been at the start of the story, which would be an odd time for a sudden change in direction.

Curly fries, dude.
---
yea it's at one of the vendors, exp too
---
I think part of it was he absorbed it as an already ancient dragon, long set in how his magic works and what he does.
---
Whereas Aurene absorbed the magic in order to grow up, so they're part of who she is as a dragon. 
---
So Kralk had conflict with who he was and what the magic wanted, Aurene got to grow with the various magics within her and define who she was by including the magic in the first place.

Nice work Cy! See you in wvw.
---
Excuse my ignorance, but what does it mean for it to be "gated"?
---
ip block
---
Wait what how
---
You cannot even unlock Skyscale today from what it seems, after you did newborn skyscale ( which is the scales, the medicine and the eggs, you have to wait for daily reset to do saving skyscales ( cannot tell what it is yet ) and after you did that you have to wait for another daily reset to get to raising skyscales... another reset for troublesome skyscales and another reset for riding skyscales 
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
so earliest you can get the mount on saturday as it seems
---
How ludicrous was that bubble of energy that Aurene popped?
---
Dragon can unleash an H bomb from a fart.
---
So if Kralkatorrik wasn't afraid of the vision of a world without him, what was he feeling?
---
After you finish the Newborn Skyscales collection you have to wait until the next daily reset for the next collection to unlock...
---
There are 4 VM merchants total, and they have a few items in common but mostly offer unique items like trinkets, minis, tonics, GH decorations, etc.
---
What happened to “AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH” - Sugarcube.GW2
---
And again for the next.. and again for the next.. The earliest you can actually get the mount is on saturday.
---
I completed the scales and the medicine, and it unlocked a new one, where I'm supposed to give the medicine to skyscales scattered  throughout the map. I guess I'll have to wait then
---
such talent. I am always impressed with the artists there.
---

---
In general, this release feels like a conclusion to...well, everything post-core. The Map is Silverwastes style like S2 (also comparable to DS from HOT), uses Keys like S2 and HOT, features Gliding from HOT, Ancient Magics from S3, of course mounts from POF, and even Roller Bettle from S4. The themes also throwback to the past releases of Core/Orr with Underworld (also the first time The Pact has really shown in since...HOT?), HOT with Melandru, and POF with the Fissure of Woe.
---
How do people already have skyscales than if this is the case, and how do you know about all this if there hasn’t been enough time to complete these?
---
He's near the skyscale platform where Caithe was hanging out but the opposite wall.
---
Amazing timing
---
He should NOT be smiling that much.
---
Includes.
---
They use rented ones :d
---
just hold it down for autofire lol
---
I am 99% certain they left no in-game teasers so that people wouldn't blast map chat about it, and that in the coming weeks we are going to get a big show for what is coming in LS5.
---
We'll wait and see though.
---
Are you serious? What the hell...
---
WASTED
---
watch where you land!!
---
it's not the only logical answer. people make bank off raid sells and TP.
---
It seems after eggs you have to wait for daily reset, how annoying :v As if 8 collections are not enough
---
How do you get the Gift from Aurene?
---
I can't even remember corsairs with unique gloves or shoulders. All seem to reuse existing gear.
---
It's a daily timegate. Looks to be at least three days minimum. Says on the locked achievement. Had I known I would've worked harder for this because I freaking missed it by 7 minutes so I pretty much have to wait out the full 24 hours.
---
I feel my motivation to bother draining. What terrible design... too bad we don't have an AMA today. :P
---
Not gonna lie, after previous one, it felt really anticlimactic and ridiculously short.
---
Huge disappointment at the time gating for the new mount.  It isn't available today but in 5 days.  Specially annoying for those in EU where the ep was released in at 18 pm or later and now have to wait an extra day to have the mount.
---
So how does it being a secret help?
---
If she comes back she better be at least the half the size of Kralkatorrik. Don't (elder) dragons are bigger the more magic they hold? How she could fit all this magic in such small body?
---
Agreed
---
If that's what you consider a spoiler, then you're probably better off avoiding this sub for a while.
---
A better question: Where iz Zojja?
---
Kas and Jory were always filler characters, sorry. Destiny's Edge were our friends and mentors and the ones who started the Kralk plotline, yet they were incredibly abscent. No Eir spirit fighting from the mists, no Zojja last minute comeback. Nothing.
---
I feel the same, missed it by 10 mins. If I had known about this guide I would have made it by 6 minutes. feelsbadman.
---
can you show us what it is ?
---
I'd make it give a stacking effect, and spend 10 Spirit Shards per stack instead gold, and put next to the Enchanting Powder BL NPC in the Vaults another NPC that exchanges BL consumables with an everlasting version for something else, like 'statuette fragments' that can be used to make BL statuettes, so the consumable teleport to friend doesn't become useless.

Something well set up and clever like baiting them into an ambush with a ship full of bloodstone and an array of ground-to-air batteries.  Something that implies competence on the part of the heroes rather than another random win.
---
Yup, also great for alts
---
Everything they have said and done since the previous episode from the livestreams and interviews to the trailer has laid it on thick about the sorrow and despair with Aurene's death. And its all been rendered a lie. They knew what they were going to do with War Eternal did they not realise how it would all come across in hindsight? Its baffling to me.
---
Aurene is Neo
---
oh we all are, could you imagine going in blind on some of these scavenger hunts they've had?!
---
Kralkcaketorik
---
It’s because Aurene showed up at an event you were at.
---
Try using gw2efficiency.com and use its crafting tab its super nice.
---
and even PoF communication spots! I bet noone would expect them
---
Collection of 12 other collections...
---
MeIRL
---
It's what we had at the end of each GW1 expansion.  
---
Tied off, fireworks, people applauding.  
---
Unlike the original experience in GW1 where you literally get on a boat and find yourself in Droknar's Forge. Lmao. Best ending ever. "You go on a boat".
---
I don't find it cool what so ever. All the hype for the new mount is gone now, specially since i i finished the egg collection 10 minutes after todays reset. So thats a whole day without any collection being done.  I would rather just pay 500g and have it now.  Fetch quests or """"achievements"""" aren't fun at all. It is actually pretty frustrating. The thing i was expecting the most became the most frustrating aspect of this episode.
---
I know you've had questions of how and such but mine while being similar is different...How!
---
But acutaly. How do you aquire enough mystic cloves? I'm starting to look at making my first one. And I forsee them being the hardest part. Or any advice for making them would be appreciated.
---
Because people are asking how he did it and hes leaving out the fact that spending cash is a large factor. How do you not see how that would matter?
---
I mean, I stayed up till 3 in the morning getting that unlock before reset
---
Tiny little Aurene shot out a single blast that blew off an entire wing of this zone-sized beast. How much power is that!?
---
No. If the devs chose to make Kralk say "mother" for his final words, it mean it's referring to his mother. Why is everyone trying to find a way for Aurene to be the mother??
---
Also make sure your screenshot folder isn't nearly full. Spammed the screenshot button during the gorgeous cinematic, alt tabbed after the ending, and saw that only 2 of the shots had taken. And they weren't even that good. :/
---
He doesn’t have to answer if he doesn’t want to? It’s literally nobody else’s business, and he has stated a few times that he’s selling raid clears and working TP.
---
I'd say this episode was well underway before the layoffs.
---
I still want to see more of them in Core maps:
---
* More core bosses and champions gaining skills that trigger the Counter Magic special action skill.
---
* Updrafts spawning over volcanoes and lava after events. And appearing after completing optional pre-events along gliding bombs like on the Shatterer.
---
* Thermal tubes near volcanoes and hot springs.
---
* Speed and Adrenaline mushrooms appearing near some core world bosses and metas, or spawning temporarily after optional pre-events are completed.
---
* Spears and other mount weapons available in more world boss events.
---
* Flames of Koda pilgrims in shiverpeaks core maps that will give their staves after completing an event to build a brazier and an event to defend it against corrupted minions.
---
* Magical vines that can be spawned near hard to reach spots in high places by defeating a veteran enemy attacking a neutral treant. 
---
* Siren of orr songs appearing by attacking risen across all the core orr maps.
---
People are asking how he did it so quickly. Spending cash is a key factor, how are you missing this? the fuck lol
---
I noticed the callback immediately too, and I've only seen it on the wiki from when I was reading about the known dragons.
---
Yeah this is the exact opposite of what they should have done. I know so many people who won't even both now that they know it's tiers of collections gated behind daily lock outs.
---
Three collections of scavenger hunts with 14-21 items each was a lot of work, even if you use one of the guides available now. Keep in mind it also required 30 events across the map (which is a lot more than the griffon).
---
Now people have to wait several days to complete it. The mount should unlock earlier in the collections, the extra tiers of the collections should unlock something like a mini pet, not several days just to get the mount.
---
This is dragging down and otherwise great episode.
---
Good storytelling has consequences and is subtle, this had neither.
---
We have a benevolent ED on our side now. That's more than enough to hint at S5.
---
Probably didn't seem too big while we were on Aurene because they seriously toyed with size and perspective.
---
Kralk was a bit model, bigger than dragon champions, but he wasn't a map-sized model in that instance. Instead, Aurene and the Commander were shrunk to miniature size (and constantly rescaled during separate sequences). A very clever and PC-stress-reducing trick.
---
I’m not missing anything my dude I’m simply asking why the fuck it matters lol. He owes nobody an answer as to how he did it 😂
---
Yeah, I've been taking a break from the game and am a few chapters behind.  I was really surprised that they did that.
---
Besides the huge disappointment that was Aurene being resurrected not 5 minutes into the episode (disappointing as in, the big cliffhanger at the end of ep4 being blown away so quickly), and several dubious plot points (Aurene can blast wings off super-amped up elder dragons, Kralkatorrik and the islands just float in place in open ocean, ley-lines manifest inside these islands directly pointing into Kralk's conviniently open mouth), I think the episode was OK.  
---
 I liked the ending, I'm pretty sure Aurene flies over Cantha (not 100% sure though) and this hopefully points to an expansion/LW episode, foreshadowing as Kralk says 'Mother' as he dies, and finally him saying 'I hope you never have to kill what you love' hinting towards Aurene having to fight us in the future?   
---
But honestly, way too many sudden revelations and spur-of-the-moment coincidences and plans for me to be totally satisfied with it. GW2 story is at its best, in my opinion, when the story is done slower, with preparation and consideration, and some minor improvisation, such as the expansion stories. Add in decisions with true consequence such as the deaths in HoT and you have a good story, I think.  
---
The map, on the other hand, is incredible. Honestly can't think of an issue I have with it off the top of my head. Great aesthetics, really fun to explore, LOVE the reintroduction of old masteries, fun events and plenty of rewards. Amazing job with this one.
---
Jesus christ is everyone a media critic in 2019? Between GoT and this and everything else it is really awful to read some subreddits lately
---
&gt; While it might not be fun or engaging its something the game needs.
---
If it's not fun or engaging, it's bad game design.
---
There are better ways to make players stick around. Daily gates are just a cheap trick in lieu of that.
---
Imagine if you were watching a movie, only to find that you could watch ~15 minutes of it per day. Truly an engaging and enjoyable experience, for sure.
---
They really went the other end of extremes in 'rewarding' metas, didn't they? :p
---
It matters because without spending large amounts of money this is nearly impossible. Whatre you going on about? Jesus Christ, shits not that serious, its an important detail when people are curious as to what they need to do in order to accomplish what he has.
---
Episode 4 i believe.
---
This happened to me. I tried leaving the instance a few times but I had to eventually relog completely and that did fix it for me.  This was earlier in the day, before the recent bug fixes.
---
So you're saying we need more Chrono Trigger :)
---
It's a scam, I did the entire collection in one go without any resets or 14 mini collections, its just pretty long
---
Yes, different servers have different counts, but playing in a higher tier server (you can find the ranking online), you'll definitely find people playing
---
“Shits not that serious” says the guy pressuring OP into sharing what he may or may not spend money on. 
---
If you don’t buy his reply that he’s stated multiple times that’s your business, Carol, not OPs.
---
You have an effect applied to you that's making your whole body glow yellow. It's either from your food or a cosmetic jewel/infusion.
---
Because he said she is the first of her kind? It means she is the mother of all following her.
---
&gt;I dont know why ANYONE is surprised that Aurene would come back from the dead, and why its considered bad writing.
---
Because it is bad writing... Anet was manipulating us with the trailers and stories and everything even tho many people could see MILES away that this is EXACTLY what was going to happen. And guess what? Not even their teaser trailer made sense because they talked about how death can give life and hope and 5 seconds in we get a cliché 80's Disney "I'M ALIVE!" moment.
---
Yes yes. Anet good, Aurene amazing, the gw2 community is the best in any MMO.
---
Why does the Skyscale Egg Hatching Collection require all Season 4 Episodes? Not that I'm in a position to make demands, but this is really bad practice. Returning players will now be forced to buy all of Season 4 just to be able to complete a collection that's also timegated - that's a whole other topic. Great. As if it's not already enough that you're basically forced to buy HoT and PoF and now even the Living World Seasons.
---
They could have the isntances be filled with poop and it still wouldnt one up GoT
---
Kralk and Aurene absorbed most of Balthazar's magic when he died, but who took most of Balthazar's power and replaced him in the pantheon is unknown. When the other gods imprisoned him there wasn't much magic left in him. If I understood it correctly that's the reason why he consumed the bloodstone magic to power up again. Menzies is probably a strong contender for the new god of war, considering he wanted to replace Balthazar for a long time.
---
But this would be so blatantly confusing to make Kralk say "mother" if he meant "Aurene"... It's very obviously a hint to something else
---
I keep reading boring and uninspired, but there is no better suggestion. Because if you want to be fun and inspired make it that the gods returned, they give the Commander all their power, he turns into a Giant the size of an Elder Dragon and we wrestle him to death. Sounds fun and inspired but it’s shitty writing, just like your previous idea. The plot ended correctly, the final battle was amazing and it goes accordingly with the Lore so far. Making your complains just nonsense.
---
Kralkatorrik is weak against her specifically and he was wrecked in the last episode and this time we finished him off and hit a crit/weak spot.
---
too bad if you did the instance with a party the other party memeber were stillfull size and could mount...talk about immersion breaking
---
That describes GoT perfectly. A lot of the individual scenes are neat but they're no continuity with the weapons (scorpions shite against dragons, then take out a dragon omg, then are useless again), everyone appears to be fast traveling everywhere, and despite everyone going to Winterfell and then returning Cersei doesn't have a baby bump at all. It just doesn't make sense.
---
I feel like they've hesitated too much about restricting masteries out of fear of players not being able to use them due to not having the content.
---
The fact that Dragonfall is made of a bunch of the god realms is a convenient excuse lore-wise, but they should have done this earlier even if it stretched the lore a bit.
---
Traversal in Dragonfall is fun and that matters more than a ley line or a thermal vent feeling a bit out of place. This zone is basically what I imagined the mastery system would eventually lead to. I was moving through the zone and, without really thinking about it, I grabbed an oakheart essence, swung up high, mounted the griffon mid-air, dove to pick up speed, and then ascended, dismounted with Bond of Faith, glided over an event, re-mounted the griffon and engaged. 
---
This is the kind of movement you get when you let all of these things coexist, and it's glorious.
---
Can't you just use the teleport scroll?
---
They seemed to be maturing, they talked about people coping with grief and loss with our stories, and about how death is not meaningless if it can inspire people with the trailer. 
---
They actually showed a glimpse of what consequences of our actions look like with the last episode.
---
I didn't expect them to immediately flush it down the toilet one episode later.
---
Hundreds of games out there, if not 1000's. Don't have to stick with this one . Shrug.
---
"The End" is an absolute INSULT to the intelligence of players who have been following the story.  They put all this investment into making it look like Aurene was gone for good, but then NOPE.  It's all LOL SHE ATE JOKO SO SHE'S OK.  Fucking pathetic.  Absolutely fucking pathetic.  These writers have no goddamn balls whatsoever.  This is almost as bad as what Nomura did in Kingdom Hearts 3.  
---
Yes, I AM angry.  And miss me with that "lol geting mad at a viddygaem" bullshit too.
---
I wonder if Joko knew about this. He mentioned about remembering one of the Elder Dragon (not sure Primordus or Krakaltorik) as a small lizard at one point.
---
This collection is infuriating, 0/10. Who the fuck thought running around for hours pressing F is good content, ffs anet...
---
Wow, youre super annoying 😂
---
I don't think it was a reference, as much as it was "the back of a dragon on the ground".
---
I like the content, it just felt like it was a small amount compared to normal..idk
---
I wonder how many people are actually involved with the story? Don't they discuss it as a group and point out glaring plot holes to each other? Feels like they hired Angel McCoy back again.
---
It hurts even more when you complete one of the fetch-athlon right as the daily reset tick.  Never been so sad to see the daily chest.
---
So unexpected I forgot to check them out! But yah, this map has so many throwbacks to older maps in the best ways possible.
---
I have to agree a bit after finishing the collection and finding out i have to wait because its timegated. i felt like i wanted to pull my hair out
---
I was SO disappointed when I saw this... This is just the only thing that I hate in todays update... And it's the worst.
---
 **Kormir:** No. He isn't. Balthazar has been stripped of his claim and title. He is no longer one of the Six. 
---
So there is a new god of war now.
---
What an annoying collection
---
I recently convinced my friends to play GW2 (It was amazing to convince them to play an mmo to begin with!), and I was wondering how much I've missed after starting the game so late in its life. Are we going to be able to get all of the story after missing so much live content, or can we get everything we need in the paid expansions to play later? Sorry if this isn't the place to post this, but the bot removed my previous post. I'm not very good with reddit.
---
Keep in mind that the wing Aurene blew off was already bleeding profusely by the time she shot it with her Kamehame-Hyper Beam.
---
I also really love the name. The map you fight Mordremoth on is called Dragon's Stand and the map you fight Kralkatoric on is called Dragonfall. Seems like a cheeky theme.
---
Yeah the scaling definitely seemed off from the start and he looked even smaller when he turned to look at us but I blame that on perspective and game mechanics.
---
No looked it up says it could be the hard drive did every scan possible sf scan virus scan etc.. says critical process died i7 7700, 250gb ssd, 1tb hd, GeForce gtx 1060, 16 gb ram
---
I see alfred hitchok silhouette in the left side, purple.
---
I legitimately cannot find a SINGLE reason why the hell is this timegated. Not a single one.
---
That's Arc.
---
We have a squad of people just jumping off the cliffs for the revives LOL
---
Also it takes SO long to take all these scales. Why can't I pick this stuff instantly, what's the fun of me getting killed to bunch of mobs cause I need to wait to pick this stuff up.  
---
It got me so mad. And I have to visit the SAME places several times for different items... That is NOT fun. This is a TERRIBLE collection design.
---
I really REALLY want to thank ANET for adding markers for every little step of the skyscale collection....it showes you where NPCs are and where things like water, and quick sand are from anywhere on the map
---
&gt; I guess "Death is not death" was literal, not metaphorical.
---
Well, one can say it was talking about Kralk's death rather than Aurene's. I don't buy it anyway, though.
---
*Barcelona &amp; Ajax fans sweating*
---
Looks like the elder dragons became corrupted by the magic they absorbed. And I suspect it was because when living things absorb magic and then use the magic or the magic leaves their bodies when they die, their memories and feelings are also imprinted in the magic.   
---
Something like how the Dream has memories and feelings too. The 'Dream' could be memories and feelings of past living things stored over the eons in the 'soul of Tyria' the Pale Tree often mentions. So the Pale Tree would be tapping into the flow of magic and filtering it by having her roots in a leyline hub like how a normal tree takes water and nutrients.  
---
If I'm right and magic contains memories just like the mists, when some individuals take in that magic, they cannot not cope with those memories and feelings and go crazy.  
---
Something similar would have happened with the Bloodstone explosion. The memories and feelings of Chosen murdered over it to power soul batteries were strong enough to form Gorseval. And when the bloodstone exploded, those who got hit by the magic explosion when "Bloodstone Crazed", and could only think about getting more magic.
---
So it seems that Aurene can assimilate magic better than Kralkatorrik could, and keep it flowing, sharing it with the living things in Tyria, without being corrupted by it. Probably because her connection to the Champion, Caithe, and friends allowed her to understand better all these memories and feelings and cope with them.
---
The best part of the episode for me.
---
Debi Derryberry is amazing.
---
Who's Angel McCoy?
---
Here is my favourite (sarcasm) one.
---
You have to revive someone 18 times while under the effect of Dwayna's buff
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/ysZzRcB.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ysZzRcB.jpg)
---
&gt; Predictability is perfectly fine, as long as the story recognises it's there and frames the events accordingly. The reason it felt off is because the previous episode put so much emotional emphasis on the grief, in an apparent effort to impart finality and thus warp expectations; but without any intentions to actually have it make an impact.
---
Exactly and I've said as much in other posts.
---
Please never bring back Counter Magic, it was so fucking annoying, especially fighting more than one thing that applied it at a time.
---
Which you clearly cant or else youd understand 😂😭 But after reading your post history, everything makes sense. Good day little man.
---
Hardly. I rarely open Black Lion Chests and have 71 Teleport to Friend remaining. While the new one is only usable every hour, I'm totally going to use it every chance I get to get to a boss someon calls out, or to an event that's far rom a waypoint. There are a LOT of those kinds of events.
---
Play some Wow at its current state, and you will appreciate GW2 haha.
---
I'm probably not going to do this collection tbh.  I don't really see much point when there are so many ways to travel and explore in the new map.
---
If I do end up doing it then it'll be after the hype dies down.  I mostly feel like I'd rather spend the time elsewhere rather than slaving away on an extra luxury. 
---
It's a cool mount, but nothing about that really made me feel like I needed it enough to be willing to jump through a week's worth of hoops.  With the Wayfarers henge atleast there was some cosmetic progression. 
---
With this? Not so much.  I'm sure the mount skins will be glorious, but more often than not there's very little sense of retroactive Castlevania style map design.  I haven't felt like, "if only I had a skyscale I could see what's up there?"
---
I guess I don't find LW all that easy. There are "bosses" or just general fights that I will have to bang my head against a few times to clear. Especially in fights where there are a lot of AOEs going every which way. Part of the reason I liked necro was because I could just faceroll some of the mechanics and when my health got low I just swapped to reaper and facerolled some more while my health pool went back up. I had really hyped myself on scourge and pushed hard to get it unlocked, but as I said once I got it unlocked I didn't like it at all. I know it's a silly reason to drop a class, but I felt a lot of disappointment. 
---
I've been splitting my time between engineer and elementalist. I boosted my engineer (now wishing I had done it the other way around, oh well) and used as many tomes as I had on my ele to get her to level 60. Been playing catch up on my engineer with her story and been doing dailies and general core map stuff on my ele. I like them both, but I think I like my ele a bit more, just hoping I am not setting myself up to fail in LW due to my above mentioned struggles. With my engineer I really like the turrets (even though I know they aren't optimal), it really plays into my fantasy of a steam punk little asura running around with a bunch of random technology. With ele I like how flashy the class is, but I do worry about survivability.
---
Except that Kralkatorrik deviated from the normal dragon pattern. Wake, eat, sleep. He woke, ate, then kept eating and consuming the backend of reality. Not quite the same thing.
---
&gt;!Time skip. The Commander and Aurene likely just landed on an airship after the initial event while the Pact unloaded stuff and pitched tents. I kind of would have liked to help set up the base camp in an instance, personally, but eh.!&lt;
---
whoever the other gods appoint, they basically stripped his power and his mantle from balthazar so I'd assume they're eventually going to want to bestow that on someone else. real question is if that someone else will even be human or will they just find/create a new race and hope they do better than us (well them).
---
Ah,  timegated like that. Beetle had similar limit, but with events. But I’d say it’s more acceptable if it’s about items, than it shows just in an achievement tab. 
---
And I gotta say, mounts are way more important than any skins, even if not required. They are more popular too. And the way you have to do new collection is just horrible and disappointing, at least for me. I really didn’t think it could be that boring and terribly long.
---
There also was the Inquest golem backpack, you could only use one code per day. Fir a week. On one part of a 4 part collection. 
---
That was annoying
---
Oh that is annoying. Why would they do something similar when they already tried and that was a bad idea (i suppose people complained about that timegate).
---
What about now that you have it?
---
I think they just know their demographic!
---
i was going to ask why karlk is standing on a field of viscera... then i saw that neck in the second picture... that cant be cake right? how is it held up if it is?
---
I'm sure this is some kind of "test" on the community to see if they can get away with something like this to accomplish something they had in mind, but this is defo the wrong way to go about it and we should let them know.
---
I wish they would add a few in Verdant Brink.
---
Even though this is just a game I feel the same way. It is just annoying as fuck without any reason at all.
---
Not as good this can easily be looked as something Game of Thrones related lol..
---
Did you complete Egg Hunt today after reset?
---
The Skyscale collection hunt is time gated.
---
More Mary Sue bullshit
---
Had some things to do all day, so just finished.
---
I didn't expect Aurene's return to happen so early in the episode.  Then she immediately took off to kick Kralk's butt.  Amazing how upbeat everything was after that kick in the soul last episode.
---
I just about screamed when we finally got to hear Aurene's voice.  Not gonna lie, I was super jealous of Caithe last episode since she got to hear her but not us.
---
As soon as they said Kralkatorrik's head was buried underground, I was a bit disappointed that the final showdown would be "head-on-a-stick" again.  I was pleasantly surprised when said showdown happened.  
---
I never thought I'd actually feel bad for Kralk.  He was still a monster in the end, but finding out the magic inside him was tearing him apart and causing him to suffer to the point of madness made me pity him.  
---
Kralk's last words.  Aurene betrayed her kind, but is the first of her kind.  She has become something different than the typical Elder Dragon.  He hopes she never has to kill what she loves, which sounds like ominous foreshadowing.  Also, "Mother" is super intriguing.  Even the Six just assumed the Elder Dragons have always existed, but their creator might still be out there somewhere.  
---
I'm actually very excited about the fact that they just let us have a happy ending and didn't tease some new terrible threat.  For the first time in a long time, we have no idea what's coming for us next.  We don't know where or when the peace we won will be broken.  That uncertainty is pretty awesome to me.
---
I think that he was referring to the Torment of Kralkatorrik.
---
Should have kept him alive
---
Ah, come join the exordium army, there's at least a dozen of us at each meta event.
---
i feel nothing but massive envy for you. Till today, i haven't even get to farm up for Incinerator :(
---
Not really. Knowing Arenanet, that's the exact sort of plot thread or detail that they throw in and then ignore until half the current playerbase is gone and the other half forgot.
---
You just need 10 events per lane
---
Perhaps it's foreshadowing? All of that magic in Kralkatorrik didn't die with him. Aurene holds that magic now.
---
It was beautifully done. It's amazing to have this kind of experience in an MMO.
---
Maybe he was one step on another world welcoming his Mother?
---
At this point I've got two theories
---
1. Reincarnation: Elder Dragons come and go. They are replaced by another dragon beings. Overtime huge amounts of magic corrupts them. In this game magic corrupts. We saw that in Bloodstone Fen. Then they also get replaced. It's War Eternal. Neverending fight to keep the harmony in Tyria.
---
2. Mother of (Elder) Dragons: There was Mother, the Elder Dragon which was the source of all the magic aspects. She was pure and good. Then she born her sons and gave one aspect to each of them. They were good, but not as good, because when she died they went nuts overtime.
---
Just south of the bridge from pact WP.
---
Nobody knows.The mount isn't THAT great. Doesn't warrant sadistic, inception levels of collections.
---
GW2: Can I copy your homewok?  
---
GoT: Yeah just change it up a bit  
---
GW2: Ok
---
Joko?
---
 tbh knew she had to come back, and im glad she´s back, but im dissapointed at the way she came back. i feel that it was too fast, we grasped the shock of the moment because of the cliffhanger ending of the previous episode and the 4 months wait for this one. But imagine you are a new player that is just starting to complete the story, they will be like "oh daaaaang she die- oh wait now shes back"
---
Same, I basically took a year or two off as well.
---
that's awesome. They fucking earned it! Best map of the game so far for me. Exactly the kind of meta PoF had been missing. All of the callbacks in gameplay as well. It feels like they closed the book on an era. maybe season 5 opens the door on a new one.
---
More fire and brimstone than anything else.  It's reminiscent of Firehearts Rise.
---
Yeah having the model of the dragon look basically the same in the ground as it did in GW1 totally isn't a reference.
---
there is another issue with this timegate: team 3, just like they did in kourna with the beetle, forgot to flick the switch that allows players to earn XP/spirit shards while they have remaining *locked* masteries. now obviously few people actually use up their spirit shards, nonetheless is 5 days quite a long time to not see a neat little bar slowly fill up over time.
---
i'm seriously annoyed, particularly because i finished the first collection shortly after reset, have little to do in game over the coming day because of this ridiculous timegate, and have now unrecoverably fallen behind in the acquisition race, plus my ever-empty xp bar is already getting irrationally frustrating on top of it.
---
I do play WoW and I enjoy it but I like GW2’s classes more
---
updated version still causing crashes
---
Yeah. It could be argued that no dragon ever got powerful enough to breach into the mists. . . but then he should have gone back to sleep when he was full.
---
This is for the eggs, not the scales

Anyone knows what Saving Skyscales asks?
---
If you're on a US server hit me up on Vayne.8563. I help a lot of people learn the game.
---
I saw the heading and thought this would be a complaint about the perpetual grind for gold in order to get stuff. Apparently not.
---
See, it depends on what you’re motivated by. If you want to improve your character’s capabilities vertically, then it’s about obtaining Ascended gear and the other augments like sigils/runes/infusions to your build, as well as improving your knowledge and execution of the various builds and skill patterns/rotations for that class profession. When you’re bored with that class, there are eight others to move on to, with varying elite specs.
---
If you prefer more of a broad account-based capability improvement, there are masteries and mounts that unlock more flexibility in movement, more loot, more content access, etc.
---
If you want to see all the content, then following the in-game achievements will help you visit the bulk of it. (Random criss-crossing exploration also works if you’re the sort to hate point A to point B guidance.) Any other blanks, you’ll probably want to check a third party guide (e.g. dulfy) to see if you’ve missed any.
---
Me, I tend towards an initial random criss-cross because I like to be surprised by new stuff I haven’t seen yet. Then every now and again, I pick up a new medium or long term achievement goal and do the stuff necessary to earn the correct currency for it. 
---
e.g. currently working towards legendary armor, and the what-I-don’t-have gaps need to be filled in with HoT meta events to earn tokens, and earning volatile magic for trophy shipments means I am re-exploring all the LS4 maps I mostly skipped over. In the process, since this is likely to take a month or more, I am eyeing undone LS4 achievements and might fill in those blanks too.
---
Kralkatorrik explicitly mentions that the magic doesn't torment Aurene and that it belongs in her.
---
They even had an entire interview about the death of Aurene and showed streamer reactions. For what?????
---
It's time to pay to win people!!!!!
---
Yeah, the lack of any info about Season 5 was odd, too. At the very least I feel this finale was far more enjoyable than Season 3's.
---
You have no other means of progression ("gated"). In this case: timegated (you have no other means of progression other than waiting for some fixed amount of time)
---
You also forgot that the hilt on ranger gs 5 extends
---
If you're a free to play player, I'll need your account name or character name to add you to my friend's list.  I should have mentioned.
---
That was really a great ending. I'm so happy for Aurene that she finally found her voice. I like how it ended at a moment of peace.
---
Okay so just a few questions and theories 
---
1. Kalk wasn’t evil? What about everything leading up to guild wars 2 about Kalk? Going after Glint, his daughter, and killing her. Coming after Aurene all season. Glint even indicates he was evil and the whole reason destiny edge was sent to kill him.
---
Branding I can understand - that’s his magic. He doesn’t have a connection to the races and just takes what is needed.
---
2.  Mother? Another entity or simply Tyria itself?
---
3. Worlds of the gods coming down in Tyria. Why those 3 of the 6?
---
Theories
---
My guess or hope is Anet puts the dragon story to rest for now and bring in another focus.
---
1. Gods or something else get mad about Kalk tearing up the mist and decide to rid all the elder dragons . Now we have defend the elders given Aurene is now one. Feel like this is pretty likely.
---
2. Would love to see a more political war enemy. Instead of going to Cantha...Cantha invades us. We fight back and travel to Cantha. Hello GW2 factions/WvW style. No big baddy stronger than elder dragons or a god. Either invading for Bubbles, politics or attempt to slay another elder dragon...perhaps a new elder dragon.
---
Oh i agree the finale felt so satisfying. I hope the next location for season 5 is either the far shiverpeaks or the charr homelands. Now that Krak is gone and aurene is the new elder dragon its makes you wonder will we face jormag, primordus or bubbles next or there is a far greater threat?
---
You know you’ve been farming too many dragon crystal nodes when your eyes go to the smaller cakelets first.
---
I just finished my second legendary on Monday morning as a casual player.  Our definitions of casual are going to be vastly different though I think.
---
Lmfao you’re a literal child.
---
I have nothing to do with that Twitter account, but I do have this guy:
---
I already cbf to do collections that take a few hours, but hearing about all these timegates is hilarious and i know ill be saving my time for this one
---
he was crazy to the point of having 2 personalities. the one trying to kill aurene symbolized by the thing we fought inside him
---
Considering we don't even know its name, let alone encountered it, it isn't really a loose end that needs tying. If the game was curtains now steve would be far from the most egregious unfinished plot line in gaming (rip kotor2)
---
At a certain cave based stabbing point, the commander says "For blish!" so he does get mentioned.

---
That honestly sounds about like the pressure I'm under at work, which if that's the case, I'll happily take the more meandering path to my legendaries.
---
It could be overlooked if we actually explored, but the entire thing literally circles around for each collection. In certain cases, the eggs, scales, and skyscales were right next to each other but we are forced to comeback to them separately.
---
Please use the pinned megathread.
---
Exactly, really pleased they executed this well. They should do it for future maps, even if it's just 1 little area it's better than only being able to use it in 1 map not really much of a "mastery" if so.
---
[Killed by the architects](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_YdCUuEO1LM/hqdefault.jpg)
---
if you play 1 hour a day you should be able to farm the gold and materials. its not hard :P
---
Are you getting "combat data mismatch, expected 0x16 but got 0x1e"? something?
---
Was absolutely sure that it is impossible to love Aurene more than we did before and now they voiced her and turns out I was wrong.
---
Kudos to the VA actress, fantastic work done.
---
Are you getting "error: combat data mismatch, expected 0x16 but got 0x1e. disabling"?  
---
I had mount redial and mechanics log, but I removed both and put the fresh d3d9.dll in
---
&gt;Kalk wasn’t evil?
---
If we approach the dragons as simply being natural forces that exist to reduce the amount of damaging magic in the Tyrian ecosystem then none of them are evil because it's like assigning morals to a hurricane.
---
No one mentioning the final fight was a half assed Conjured Amalgamate?
---
Hello GW2 community,  
---
1: Do I have to do PoF and HoT quests?  
---
2: What's the best weapon for warrior to deal damage?  
---
3: Is it better to craft gear or just buy them?
---
While the episode was pretty fun to play, the story was definitely super weak.  
---
  
---
I honestly have no problem with Aurene coming back to life, but it was WAAAAAAYYY too easy and too fast. It took what, 5 minutes into the first chapter for her to come back? not even that, probably.
---
My crack theory is that Tyria herself is a living thing of sorts (sort of like Azeroth in WoW.) In this case, maybe Tyria is a mother of elder dragons, in a way. With ley lines as the lifeblood flowing through the planet, it would make sense that the Elder Dragons feed upon it, almost like Tyria is nourishing them, like they are nursing on their mother.
---
It's long been suggested that they are sort of just neutral forces of nature which can do good or (more often) bad... But, mostly that latter bit happens in their pursuit of ley magic and such. They don't seem to directly want to screw us over (unless we get in their way) and damage they do to our cities and such is just collateral damage while they seek out their next snack. Calling them evil would be like calling an earthquake or tornado evil... Devastating? Sure. But, they don't do it on purpose.
---
This episode pretty much confirmed that fact, with Kralkatorrik showing empathy and understanding, as well as acceptance of his own death and Aurene's ascension in the end. We saw him struggle with the facets of his being that had been corrupted by consuming the magics of the dragons, which leads me to believe that Tyria (or whoever else created or gave birth to them) made them with the intention of having them contain that specific form of magic for a reason.
---
I think it might be a bit instructive to consider how they handled Spock's death in the Star Trek films.
---
First, they faked out his death because the idea that a major character like Spock would die was certainly not necessarily a believable thing to many people, especially in 1982. It's pretty common now, but at that time major characters really just didn't die and stay dead. Also, there had been a leak and so many fans were already expecting him to die. To try to counter all of this they had him "die" in a *simulation* at the start of the film so that the audience would have their guard down. Then, when he really did die at the end,it was a much stronger impact and felt much more lasting.
---
Second, when they brought him back they made sure it had a *cost*. It had a cost for Spock himself, who didn't exactly just resurrect but moreso was kindof reborn without any of his memories or personality which had to be reintegrated over the course of at least two further films - so in real audience time Spock wasn't really himself again for *seven years*.  It also had a cost beyond him. Kirk's son was killed in the process of saving Spock, so although Spock lived there was the loss of life; they couldn't just come out without death. Kirk and the rest of the crew had to be willing to make great personal sacrifice (they expected that they were going to lose their careers and be convicted of a variety of serious crimes). 
---
With Aurene, there was probably just *too much* stuff pointing to the strong probability that she was not really dead, and maybe more importantly there was no cost. She seems not only to not suffer any real ill, but is even maybe stronger after her return. The rest of the characters don't suffer any losses, either. It really is like the death was just a "trick" that didn't count for anything.
---
You will do some of it through the skyscale achievements, i guess it is not that long.
---
Wait, is that a new mount?
---
In case any of your are wondering, this is a reference to /u/Monstrum27 and his comic character. You can find his work [here](https://commanderyes.tumblr.com/) and more of Goldclaw's work [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Snargle_Goldclaw).
---
Aurene flew off to have a conversation with Bubbles about how ep 5 is going to need an antagonist.
---
The Fissure of Woe part is like the Flame Legion maps, but better. The Underworld parts are like Orr but better. Can you imagine what this game would be like if they made those older maps with today's tech?
---
The old ways are not always the best ways.
---
Don't tell me how to enjoy my free time. If I don't value the time spent solving a puzzle, who are you to tell me not to skip it with a guide so I can do the parts I enjoy?
---
Is there any way to get the Desert King Throne now? I was saving up to get it, just got enough and now its gone
---
Kralkatorrik confirmed for Nick Fury
---
WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME??
---
Kinda off-topic, but what's the most efficient way to farm HoT masteries? HoT masteries like ley line gliding requires so much exp :P
---
Also on that note, were the Pact airships still fighting Zhaitan in the background on this new map?
---
whats wrong with wanting to be efficient and fast? if you don't wanna do it in one day you don't have to either way. but preventing people from doing it how they like to do it doesnt help anyone. also the burnout argument is kinda whack and you know it. if they wanna keep the map/content alive, there are plenty of better ways than doing time gated achivements....
---
&gt;The Elder Dragons are neither good nor evil. They are forces of nature.
---
Thing is tho, Zhaitan and Mordremoth were decidedly evil.  They said and did evil things and had evil goals.
---
I like how the look of your character changed as well over time. Gives it more “time passes“ vibes.
---
i just put all my characters at the astralarium and did the heart there on 50 characters each day. was the easiest way to get all the kralkatite since that heart just meant spamming f on a bunch of different things in a circle.
---
Ele is infamous for being meh in open world and story, cuz the low hp makes it really easy to die. But it is great in raids and fractals. It’s the highest dps you’ll get.
---
Engineer is actually a great option, specifically [power holosmith](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/power/). It’s pretty close to meta dps, and decently tanky with blocks and such. If you drop the turrets and use the meta build, you’ll be able to reach great dps and even use it in endgame pve.
---
I have done Griffon on Day 1... After Screaming at 2AM about that one instance during PoF Stroy.
---
Currently not available, no. It will either cycle back in the statuette vendor at some point or become available in black lion chests again at some point. We just have no idea when that is.
---
Elder dragons were never good nor evil, they just were. they're just nature lets say. A lot of people seem to be missing, or just plain ignoring, the fact that MAGIC DRIVES YOU INSANE.
---
We've seen this even from the very beginning of the game. We saw it with Kudu back at Crucible of Eternity story, then we saw it with Scarlet, she only went insane after using Omadd's machine, since it was a sudden burst of magic into her. Then we've seen it with everyone at bloodstone fen, Caudecus, Balthazar, the bloodstone-crazed enemies from the "Bloodstone harvest" achievements,  even the commander started to go insane from so much magic absorbed, seeing all those strange anomalies that apparear out of nowhere even tho it wasn't directly into him, but the pendant we acquired in LWS3, and then we had to cleanse that magic to not go crazy, that's the whole reason of the "Burden of Choice" achievement. Glint was the same until the Forgotten did the cleansing ritual on her and got her out of all of that.
---
Hell, we've even seen it on Lady Wisteria Whiskington. The list just goes on and on, with that same trend.
---
Kralkatorrik wasn't insane because of the magics he absorbed recently, he had already gone insane through all the centuries of constant HUGE AMOUNTS of magic eating, and the new magics only created even more conflict driving him even further down. And I think is safe to say that all the dragons are going through the same, we even said it on the epilogue.
---
So, that's basically it. TL;DR: Magic drives you insane.
---
Man it just feels weird to see this story end, I mean Aurenes arc has been with us since Season 2.
---
Sad to see her go but i’m glad Kralkatorrik and her are over for now, I’m really interested to see what the new arc will be now that most of the dragons are out of the picture(except bubbles).
---
Holy crap, and I thought my 250ms latency was bad...
---
Thanks!
---
2 are asleep and the 3rd is very immaterial. They could table it indefinitely and it'd be fine. What consequences are there that Steve lives? Some amount of quaggans and krait are around that is supposedly more than usual, I guess?
---
Not sure if anyone is still reading this thread but is this the first time we've seen a non-cutscene use of motion capture? I'm referring to when Caithe went to hug and caress Aurene's corpse in the first instance. That looked so fluid like Palawa Joko's final cutscene in episode three.
---
same I just did it again and it passed.  a bit annoy to play the boss fights in this game since i am using a controller and the special key doesn't work on boss targets.
---
Account based unlock access
---
No kidding, things can't just a fun experience. I'd like to know what amazing brilliant literary work they're accustomed to.
---
I agree the quest, and even the zone can be implemented better. But there's far more here than just a fetch quest. That's like saying none of the other events, or the armor collection or anything else has any meaning at all. 
---
The fetch quest could have been better implemented. The zone shouldn't reset. But there's plenty here besides just a fetch quest.
---
Haha, happened to me once, scared the shit out of me!
---
&gt; In SQL, that would be considered very expensive 
---
It's really not. There is only 708 minis, 189 light Head Gear skins, etc. We're not talking about millions of entries to check but a few Ks for a player. If the data is prepared right, looking up an item from one list to another is O(1). O(n) would also be fairly inexpensive in this case. In fact, GW2 Efficiency already offers all these features.
---
&gt; GW2's object-oriented database I'm sure it is impossibly expensive. 
---
I don't see any indication that they use anything other than a relational database.
---
Tried it for 2h, it's not THAT good; The drop seems to be under some kind of ICD, not matter how many mob i kill, it drops a piece every 5-10 sec *shrugs*
---
Kids these days don't know MMO grind.
---
1) what do you mean by "quests" here? 
---
2) For power, axe/axe and greatsword generally, for conditions, sword and longbow. For conditions, you also use a torch offhand, so sword/torch and longbow, but that's specific to the berserker elite spec only
---
3) For anything exotic or lower, it's generally easier to just buy them. Ascended you have to craft or earn as a reward
---
lmao
---
I'd rather be ripped or jacked than having every legendary pixel in the game
---
Okay thanks but i have one last question: if i can craft my gear or buy it, then why pol do dungeons and raids, like why ppl play gw2 ( besides its fun ofc )
---
And makes me wonder if the "I hope you never have to kill somebody you love" ties into that by any chance. Did Kralkatorrik have to kill his mother sometime in the past or something perhaps?
---
achievements, skins, legendary armor, new gear sets to allow for brand new play styles, competitiveness, specific runes that you can only find in dungeons, prestige, etc.
---
Floating islands in the Mists are obviously partly magical, which I'd say accounts for the landing right-side-up part (otherwise how would they stay in one orientation while in the Mists where there doesn't seem to be an absolute gravity direction to begin with?). The fact that they managed to reach out of the sea I'd attribute to two things: one, we were relatively close to shore and that part of the ocean might still not be super deep, and two, they probably stacked on top of each other. In fact, we basically see this with how shallow the surrounding water on that map is.
---
&gt; I dunno, gravitational field? Drag?
---
wake
---
"I don't know"
---
Not really. Not only was it punctuated with the tragic (in a narrative sense, at any rate) moment of killing Trahearne, but it was immediately followed up by a cutscene of Mordremoth's magic hitting Aurene's egg, acting as a teaser for the eventual LWS3. Aside from one very minor hint, which I won't spoil here, this episode had a much more definitive ending, without setting us up for any future plot points or narrative direction, which lends the game a much-needed release of tension.
---
Abbadon and Lyssa
---
Right? Like, do one or the other. Either a timegate on some short activities a la Druid Stone (still bad but preferable), or no timegate on some long activities.
---
The problem is there really isn't much to find or explore in the new map... a letdown considering all the great ways to explore it
---
I'd say the fault is on the previous episode. They'd written themselves into a hole that can only be solved by Aurene not being dead or some other deus ex machina... and so, regardless of how much drama they want to create, she had to not be dead by the end. Why they had to do it so quickly and so abruptly I don't know, but ultimately it was either that or something even *more* cheap.
---
i bursted out laughing when i had to climb up that wing for the 20th time to get that egg lmao, but yea what ever i don't really mind that, about that time gate though... big oof
---
there have been timegated collections before and everytime people complained about it, some ppl don't learn from their mistakes appearently n they blatantly smash it in your face aswell with the achivement showing that, instead of at least packaging it behind reason like in draconis mons where you can buy X amount at each npc and they obvs reset everyday. just smh
---
I have zero empathy for people who have historically rushed through story and then whined on reddit about how there's no content now having to wait a couple days to get their mount unlock. Play other parts of the game. Play in the rest of the map. This map has one of the most rewarding metas for the season.
---
If you don't already have one, a Salvage-o-matic is the #1 must have item in the game.
---
In terms of eaters, there are quite a few at this point. You can view the list here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Converter
---
You don't need all of them, so look down the list and see which ones you think would be most worth having based on what you get a lot of. It's worth noting that if you get all of the four "Sentient" ones - all of which I consider worth having - you can combine them in the Mystic Forge to make a single item which does the same job as all four of them.
---
The input lag for movement was crazy long in that instance.
---
I mean, it's mmo content. At least I spend more time here than the other maps.
---
you had to buy items from Heart NPC's, they only sell you X amount but they reset everyday, i think thats how it was
---
The artists responsible for the environments tend to do the best work ... except for the asshole who made Bloodstone Fen such an eye sore
---
I assure you that your map was an anomaly. The maps are full of people enjoying the story and events.
---
Sweet tits
---
Not the problem here.
---
I actually didn't mind the Druid Runestone collection.  It did need more to do for each task though, and this was the perfect opportunity to make something similar with less run around.
---
You got a vision when you touched Aurene. You know what's going to happen. You know that there is still danger to be faced. But you want your companions to celebrate for now. They deserve it.
---
Personally I really enjoyed it, though it would've been nice to have a challenge mote similar to Mordremoth that added some more mechanical difficulty rather then it being a purely cinematic experience (which honestly I still really enjoyed). Playing their boss themes for their battles was a great touch.
---
all i could think of after looking at the map a bit was when we were all kids. "mooom 5 more minutes then ill get up"
---
This is pretty easy imo, even moreso for anyone doing it with the help of a guide
---
Beetle had map resource requirements (effectively a time gate), some event-dependent collections, going to different zones, and doing champion/legendary events as well.
---
Skyscale is just complete the story, do 3 laps around the map, wait for reset. It's not bad at all, albeit a bit tedious if you're going unaided by a guide.
---
I don't mind, but I am not particularly thrilled about how it happened.  
---
"oh, by the way, Aurene can talk now!"  
---
"...but Caithe's right there and you guys built an entire cutscene fo-"  
---
"*AURENE CAN TALK! IT'S COOL! DEAL WITH IT!*"
---

---
I don't know about that considering it's literally the same dragon in both of those scenes. It would be odder if it wasn't done to intentionally mirror it to some degree.
---
What about Zojja lol
---
Save it for halloween maze farm.
---
There should be like 50 Mortys.
---
I wish you the best in attaining your goal!
---
I would like to make you familiar with the abomination that was the Draconis Mons jumping puzzle.
---
Would still rather do that tbh.
---
And in this time no exp For the masterys and shards?
---
I agree completely. I like that we have an full end to things for the first time since the bloodstone blew up a couple months shy of three years ago.
---
Pretty disappointed that ArenaNet played up Aurene's death to be such a big deal, only to bring her back in literally the first instance of this chapter.  I feel like they should have maintained it until closer to the end.  Overall though, I enjoyed the story, especially the final bit inside Kralk.  Bit weird that Rox, Marjory, Kasmeer, and Canach are just totally MIA in the final scene though. 
---
The new map is incredible though.  The different zones are so distinct and vibrant, and the meta is a blast, while also having good rewards.  I love the callbacks to GW1 too.  And they brought back updrafts, bouncing mushrooms, and LS3 masteries!  Really great map to end the season on, and excited to see what they do for LS5.
---
Finally, now that Kralk's dead and in Tyria, what's to stop us from recovering Blish's body and reactivating him?
---
 Hey all, I'm a total newb and I have a few questions..  
---
I know GW2 has this "Living Story" concept, but I'm honestly not sure what that means. The way it was described to me, it sounds like the story is constantly moving forward and changing the world.
---
As a new player, is it possible to go back and experience the older parts of the story? I know we're years in now, but I'd like to know what is going on before jumping straight into the new stuff. How would I go back and find these things?
---
Also, as a side note. How accepting of new players is the game in general? I've played other MMO's where other players will pretty constantly harass you, or simply outright refuse to play with you, if you are not playing the super-optimal build, or having the absolute best gear.
---
Is the game fairly easy to catch up in? I don't expect to be ready for the highest end content within a few weeks or anything, but it would be nice to know if I'm looking at two months or two years to be up to date with things.
---
I dunno man, I think this is the one map that will remain consistently active. Not just because of the HoT meta design, but also ludicrous rewards.
---
Whenever I see that I hear Wilhelm Scream in my head
---
thx for reminding us! :(
---
I absolutely loved when Taimi and Gorrik were talking and Gorrik mentioned Taimi's thesis and she gets all cute about it
---
Reminds me of hamsters. Hamsters teeth never stop growing so they must chew chew chew or the teeth will get long enough to ingrow into their own jaw/skulls. Maybe dragons are this way. They must munch munch the magic but after a while (age?) it just gets too ingrown.
---
Yea, I was hoping Logan or Rytlock would've mentioned Snaff, Zojja and Eir.
---
Why was none of this mentioned in the livestream they devoted exclusively to the sky scale? I mean A 5 day time gate is kind of a huge deal and very annoying.
---
Probably because they knew it was going to have a bad reception. I still don't know why they went with it.
---
&gt; As a new player, is it possible to go back and experience the older parts of the story? 
---
Yes, everything except for season 1
---
&gt; Also, as a side note. How accepting of new players is the game in general? 
---
very, welcome! There are groups that will definitely get a little toxic, but they're not really the majority
---
&gt; Is the game fairly easy to catch up in?
---
yes, within a month you should be at a reasonable starting point, and you can be competitive within a few months, even shorter if you no-life the game
---
I bet they're going to use them as a springboard into the next part of the story...whenever and whatever that will be.
---
I was just thinking of something along these lines. There are pieces of actual mist realms now planted on Tyria. It's probably a bigger deal than they will treat it as sadly.
---
Please do 😀
---
As opposed to a Rytlock made of what?
---
That’s the pve one
---
Can you get us Dhuum cm lol if you're bored now you got no more legendaries to craft lol
---
I must agree. Even tho this marks the end for an fissure of woe raid/related storyline.
---
That is a pathetic fuckin excuse.
---
You can change spec whenever you like
---
I agree. The map itself is beautiful and has many great elements. But navigating around during the meta is fairly annoying. Especially so sometimes getting back on a mount to be ABLE to reach the next event marker as those towers keep hitting you every few seconds and have a long range. Not the easiest disengage in the world.
---
The map asked me to change twice maybe you're  right xD
---
I enjoy unlocking things and chasing achievements so GW2 is made for me. :P
---
Are you shitting me?
---
Devs know this patch is empty in reality so they stretch the only thing nit offers, the mount.
---
If all the pictures were in one album I wouldn't have to click through all the posts :(
---
you are cute, thinking it is not much when we you are only talking about the first of 5 collections. the second day skyscale collction also has event locks
---
Does anyone has the full map of Dragonfall? The wiki haven't been updated yet.
---
I swear the community doesn't even know what they want, everything new in this game never seems good enough. This patch was pretty damn good.
---
I saw someone with a dyed skyscale yesterday. Doesn't that mean they've unlocked it?
---
Devs explained once that when they add a timegated content, it's because of a lore explanation. Just like how they did for the backpack in Draconis.
---
I don't want to excuse them and I'm not saying I agree. But maybe in this new case, it's the same reason. 
---
I'm personaly disapointed to discover there's again a new timegate. I usually don't rush the content but i'm the kind who like to finish what I begin whenever I want. If I begin a quest in the morning I like to know it can have an end in the afternoon.... Or two days later. But in a way I planned myself, not in the way somebody else decided for me.
---
Timegates are lazy designs.
---
like 5 hours and im not joking. at least day one was like that...
---
Some of us have a thing called disposable income.
---
Made of fluff
---
i just read that mega thread, looks like pretty tedious tasks to do each step plus daily reset time gate. 
---
I got other games to play now, probably come back to the grind when there is nothing else to play, like what I did for the griffon.
---
the LS chapters aren't often on sale; not until there's a reason to push new players into buying them; I think LS2 went on sale for more than 20% when HoT came out; similarly LS2+LS3 may have gone on  sale when PoF came out.
---
I wouldn't wait for that _chance_
---
You can still put dyes on them despite being locked and when you use them with whichever skyscalr you found on map, it'll automatically follow the dye you've picked
---
For unique dungeon skins, legendary armor (raids), and for the challenge/story!
---
You´re playing the wrong Game!
---

---
How the fuck is BLUE not part of the Guardian color scheme?
---
Reminds me of Cabal Drop pods on Destiny
---
Honestly, I just do fractals everyday and then just do achievements, dungeons or whatever. I never really grind for gold and I earn enough to make the legendaries I want.
---
T4 Fractals alone give you pretty good progress everyday.
---
That’s probably not the greatest idea
---
Well... one good thing, is that the episode ends the season, without throwing us off yet another cliff. So... that is great.
---
Rox wants to stay with the Olmakhan and is afraid to tell Braham
---
Arby's has this magnificent history of ads in this style for all sorts of games and movies. You should check out their twitter. Being part of this team must be so much fun.
---
totally this. I think the thing that hit me was popping into a laval funnel out into a glide at the apex of the ascent and for the first time and suddenly realizing that it was a waaaaaaaay more efficient way of getting around the map than working to get the  skyscale. It meant having the masteries had a distinct benefit to them and that was ultimately really satisfying
---
I find this outcry pretty ...pathetic? You need everything on the spot, right now? Also caps helps, I‘m sure of it!
---
This is not what deus ex machina. We had a lot of clues that this would be possible to happen because we saw Aurene absorb Joko's magic. Pretty straightforward foreshadowing.
---
If yoi want to use the deus ex machina expression so freely you might as well learn what it means.
---
I'm hearing a lot about time gates... what's timegated?
---
I just noticed the first post had updated to include all collection. Yeah this post is useless now.
---
U can't consider that a spolier after 4 months man
---
yeah i hope next time they introduce an alternative paywall so you can spend 200€ and have it right away
---
It's been 4 months....can't be a spoiler anymore
---
Defeat Kralkatorrik's Torment bugged?
---
Did anyone else get this issue where Aurene won't follow you when you're going through the Defeat Kralkatorrik's Torment? Specifically, the part where you're supposed to "Sever the threads of magic"... I can't go anywhere because I just get blasted back to Aurene, and she doesn't move?
---
It extend for all skills
---
Nobody. But it is what it is. It's PvP maps if they want some loose lore connection or justification, it's weird time bubbles if they want repeatable dungeons, it's also planes and realms of Gods when it suits the plot or place of seemingly infinite but not really magic, it's also where dead characters are not dead when you need them to not be dead. I expect the happening to have zero effect, or at best it'll be referenced once or twice loosely in the future. At the very best, we may get a fractal instability inspired by Brand.
---
I felt like a well oiled machine swapping between mounts and skills and map mechanics to traverse the area. Good stuff :3
---
Yeah, Big Momma Primordial Dragon shows up wanting to know who the hell has been 86ing her babies and she's the size of a moon, eclipsing the entire planet in her shadow.  That would be freaky...
---
Oh wow the commander and Aurene came so far!
---
What armor pieces are you using
---
Not sure why you are downvoted, this is exactly what they did with forcing a 5-day timegate.  The collection isn't a big deal, that just means you require effort and patience.. but timegating a mount is obscene after telling everyone it was releasing today.
---
In awe at the size of this lad. Absolute unit.
---
It hurts to realize that Joko was just that big of an character because of this moment. He deserved better tbh.
---
It was a boot loop.
---
Are you ready for some lewd
---
&gt; There's also no sub fee to try and manipulate people into playing longer to keep paying.
---
All F2P/B2P MMOs with no sub fee actually time gate stuff and have grind elements. Its not to artificially extend your sub time, the reason they do it is if you log in everyday there's always a chance you'll look at the store, and like it or not that's their primary source of money.
---
Yeah it's suck, but I'm okay with it. 
---
Didn't realize that spirit shard is still something people care about.
---
Mike Z did an interview or something a month or so ago talking about season 5 some, and mentioned they could change the boundaries of an existing map in addition to new maps going forward. I hope if they do this that it'll also mean older maps occasionally get a few things that use the older masteries some more. That would be awesome.
---
Yes possibly more, the first collection took me around 5 hours, but we were still figuring out the locations, the 2n collection seems even longer.
---
I take that 5 day time gated shit over 250g like it was for the griffon, people should stop bitching about every single new thing they dont like and just accept it, deal with it, you are still gonna play the game after that.
---
The are from mount licenses which are sold in the gem store. Not all are available at the same time. 
---
Have a look at the wiki for what skin nerds what license, and if that license is available.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gallery_of_mount_skins#Skyscale_skins
---
Turn postprocessing off. That's been my fix against glow/shimmering effects. Idk if it will help for that.
---
Those 3 worlds are what we chased Kralk through in the mists and Aurene opened portals to Tyria from to the ocean above Dragon's Fall.
---
I think its also tied into the 3 magics Kralk had absorbed as to why he was flying through those mist realms. Balthazar's magic took him to Balthazar's realm, Zaitans death magic took us to the Underworld, and Modremoths Nature magic took us to Melandru's realm.
---
combat and fashion and paying for mount skins is all this game is, really..
---
Well... they kinda need to pull off a big show for LW5. This is, after all, the only thing we know Arena Net is working on right now.
---
I hear that song with the guy yelling in the clouds.
---
And the food, you uncultured necro.
---
&gt; my friend and I've long wondered if Elder Dragons weren't just benevolent beings who became...well...corrupted
---
I believe WP speculated about this in one of his streams a long time ago, but I honestly can't remember what he said exactly now.
---
WvW of course
---
Love how you showed that your character also changed over time.
---
Btw, whats the armor/dye combo in the last panel, looks amazing
---
Im disappointed but that's a norm for bitterfrost/kourna team :)
---
Usually it'll lock up and appear to have crashed when its not finished downloading the cutscene for the story step. It might actually be a bug though.
---
If its a crash only for gw2 + it's preventing you from changing windows to get the Task Manager up, then you can kill gw2 by creating a second desktop: hold down Windows key + then Tab key, then release both keys &gt; click "+" at the top to create a second desktop &gt; drag gw2 onto the second desktop &gt; click on the first desktop &gt; bring up task manager with CTRL+Shift+Esc &gt; kill gw2.
---
Yep, agreed. Also you can't directly buy ascended armor or weapons, though you can buy a core legendary.  It would just save you the grind of acquiring the mats you need to craft it which, admittedly, is a huge savings in time.
---
250g takes less than 5 days, and I would gladly trade 5 days for 500g.
---
There's a lot to unpack here but lets not bother.
---
I saw that fire aura part
---
Can someone elaborate what is this about? Some kind of a mod, third party tool or just a regular game file that gets fucked up for some reason...?
---
&gt; Not everything has to be Game of Thrones.
---
I can agree with that. Not everything has to be garbage storytelling.
---
Does it include doing Serpent's Ire? :O
---
I dunno, why would they do that after 3.5?
---
In addition to what /u/WaffleGod97 said, it would be even possible by only playing the TP. You can gain huge amounts of gold this way, without spending a single Dollar on the game. The players with the highest amounts of Gold in the game are likely to be traders.
---
Quick question: Does the 5-day time gate mean that there are 4 additional collections after the egg one?
---
Ahahhahahaha dude, you made my day.
---
Wait? folders can be full? or do you mean you ran out of storage space (cloud based maybe)? I am not being sarcastic here just legit want to know.
---
One punch man
---
Impressive.
---
I remember struggling with this back in the day, and eventually we did get better but I don't think we did it under 19min with 5, let alone 2. Awesome job! I haven't really played mesmer since the ether signet changes (and Alacrigade jail is real), but a few of the tricks I'm definitely trying.  Watching both views side by side later again.
---
Hey, is there a way to rewatch that final cutscene again?  I want to get a pic of my toon with Aurene
---
Cause 3.5 was the end of the prologue to PoF, whereas Season 4 is the epilogue to it?
---
&gt; I had hoped the layoffs, although dramatic and sad, would be a wake-up call for the writing team
---
I doubt it was a wake up call for the writing team since most of the layoffs won't have affected something probably written and done months before the layoffs.
---
Agree, came back to GW2 some time ago to get AWAY from time-gating, do NOT use time-gating as "content" -- it is NOT content and it is NOT FUN! I've been REALLY frustrated today, hate the new map, hate everything after I did the story.
---
Griffon was fun. Beetle was fun. This is NOT.
---
yes
---
Herald is considered top-tier by most people. Like top 3 at the very least.
---
There are no seperate teams anymore
---
lol who cares about exp which only gives you spirit shards
---
I’d recommend doing the stories in chronological order, per the story journal (S2, HoT, S3, PoF, S4)
---
Now it's time to find "mother"
---
and exp isn't the only source of them
---
you can buy the new armor set with spirit shards, mistborn motes, and ectos. so rather than buying null sigils like for the requiem armor, you get it for basically just playing the map and gaining exp
---
Oh god
---
People think that stories are puzzles and you "win" if you guess what's going to happen next, which means the writing is bad.
---
It's *intensely aggravating*
---
Oh so they aren't RNG? I can choose?
---
So... how many collections are after Newborn Skyscales? Is it all? Some of the pieces are not revealed.
---
A third party tool which gives you build templates and the ability to see your damage output, rotations and a lot of skills related stuff
---
This is not the Korna team, the teams were reworked.
---
Change your build or get someone to help you. Maybe take a look at [metabattle](http://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki).
---
fun.
---
its shocking, I know.
---
" Have there ever been any timegated collections? " Stellar weapons collection is timegated so yeah. 
---
This is never ever good to timegate stuff, ppl already hate it when they did it with ascended crafting way back.
---
it'a like the griffon but for cheap. doesn't need 200g to unlock :D
---
but it doesn't have those fancy speed moves either.
---
Does Aurene get a cooler name now she's an elder dragon?
---
I haven't unlocked those speed moves yet. What advantages does it have?
---
I honestly don't care. I'm not in a hurry to get it as I already have like seven mounts.
---
&gt; We were told the mount was releasing today. 5 day time-gate is not "today."
---
but it is. You can start working torwards it at the time of release.
---
&gt; Anyone who has maxed PoF masteries will avoid the map because they cannot gain any experience, therefore instant burn-out on content now.
---
That's why everyone with a bit of foresight hoards daily chests.
---
&gt; "Don't rush it!" Funny, those who dedicated their day today for the first collection will get access to the mount a guaranteed 1 day earlier than others. This was basically begging you to rush it.
---
Why exactly? What advantage do they get? Do they get something special for being the first?
---
I agree that it is unfortunate you cannot gain Spirit Shards due to being locked, though. Wasn't there a tech developed to change this so that you get Spirit Shards as long as the tracks are locked?
---
Agreed. I would consider it a spoiler, but I know I'm super sensitive about spoilers, so I avoided the sub until I was done with story and most of map completion.
---
Top answer.
---
I'll add an alternative - if WvW you can run the triumphant armor reward track and get stat selectable exotic armor.  This also unlocks the purchase of the ascended piece which can be upgraded to legendary.
---
In WvW exotic and ascended are pretty similar - difference is usually in skill and group composition.
---
I'm impressed 👍
---
That's the point. People these days wants to get everything without any effort.
---
You’ll be able to access all the story except living world season 1 with the expansions, and even complete them with your friends! You’ll have to read a summary about season 1; there’s no other way. 
---
Keep in mind living world seasons will cost gems for you. They are unlocked for free if you log in during its release (you’ll get the final episode of season 4 now as of yesterday), but unlocked for 200 gems an episode, with a season pack going on sale often.
---
Indeed. And the star-skins you are looking for are scattered across the different batches of licenses, so getting them all might prove...costly.
---
Yeah the exp being blocked is a big oversight. It wouldn't be too much of an issue if it was locked behind one big collection that could be completed on release...
---
But as it is, we won't be gaining anything until *at least* Saturday, and that's for those who actually focused on the mount collection to get it ASAP. For the rest of the playerbase, they'll be locked out longer.
---
I'm surprised Anet let this through since they have made plenty of QoL changes in the past to avoid this issue (e.g. non raiders in HoT)... But this?
---
Also, the first three collections (scales, medicine, skyscale fever) are way too overkill imo. They all require you to scout the entire new map over and over again, sometime even throwing you back onto platforms or ledges you already previously visited. It was really exhausting. Saving Skyscale was better though since it was pretty much straightforward.
---
It'll be interesting to see how the mass will react when they'll notice they need all LS4 maps, Bitterfrost Frontier (afaik?) from LS3 and complete the Dwarven dungeon in Desert Highland. The requirements are definitely higher than the griffon at this point.
---
I can still have fun on other maps, I have plenty of things I haven't done yet.
---
I wish the infusion could turn into a permanent infusion :( so sad I’d spend allot if it would!
---
might from fire and ice shouts : 7 stack of 19sec every 20sec
---
might from fire overload : 9 stack of 30sec every 30sec
---
\+3sec from Sand Squall
---
so at least 16 might cover every time only with that, double by  Heat Sync  =&gt; 25 might
---
and that without taking double SoI from chrono in account.
---
Aha, sounds useful, particularly for those in to raiding. I am going to assume it's [this thing](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/), right?
---
If it really is the same people then I think we've seen enough of their living world efforts to be honest.
---
Correct. For most raid groups it is a requirement even
---
Is that one unpopular? I really enjoyed it on release.
---
Now the Ember's Bay jumping puzzle. That I have no intention of finishing.
---
There is no standard.
---
So, like any other LS map? There's a always a boring checklist "achievement" collection with arbitrarily hidden items that you'll follow dulfy's guide to collect anyway, and then you wait until the next one. Or you just skip it altogether, farm the map for a few hours and realize there's nothing to get from it.
---
Nice map meta? New armors? Final part of corsair thingie if you're into it?
---
I think Siren of Orr is *technically* on other maps, but only used by NPCs
---
Yes they do. They just expect consequences to what happened and not have them be undone in the span of snapping your fingers.
---
I think you mean Ember Bay’s Chalice of Tears
---
Which you can’t even farm with a parked alt because you need to reach all the checkpoints to open the final chest
---
Why she speaks, how she knew it was Joko magic. 
---
How kralkatorrik suddenly cares (he didn't before). How every character in the game suddenly gets obsessed with their kids (kralk, rytlock).
---
Or, OR, the time gating punishes any player who may not have the time in the day to fully complete a phase of the collection by the daily reset and are now restricted by 24 hours of waiting for no reason.
---
Time gating is lazy design that attempts to pad out a lack of content. The collections are already by the looks of it a huge investments that may take multiple days regardless. There is NO reason for that to be artificial paced by the game, in turn removing the player's agency in scheduling their own progression through its collections. No one likes finishing a step in a journey only to find there's an insurmountable wall that's forced on them "just cuz."
---
On a personal note it feels like crap that all the involvement in PoF content contribute absolutely no EXP to the mount's mastery line at all until I finish the collection, 5 days later. It dulls any motivation to commit to the new map as time spent is wasted.
---
if done right, the griffon is as fast, if not faster than the beetle on max speed. and you can glide over the whole map without loosing too much height. when you unlocked the full masteries for griffon, do the griffon challenges in PoF :)
---
I never rush to be the first anyways I play for story and I want to enjoy it.
---
I forgot where is my screenshot button (that in-game, not default on keyboard) but that last cinematic was amazing.
---
Are all parts edible? How did you make the wing(s)?
---
Going to be coming back to this for a while
---
&gt; I agree that it is unfortunate you cannot gain Spirit Shards due to being locked, though. Wasn't there a tech developed to change this so that you get Spirit Shards as long as the tracks are locked?
---
That's actually what I referred to with this, as I may have misunderstood the exp gain thing. I read it as "I can't get exp now because of the locked masteries", as exp with max masteries / locked masteries should always go to the spirit shard track.
---
Sorry if it was confusing from my end.
---
Well first i run almost max boosters, second is i complete diamond rank every week ( some exceptions, i do have a life outside gw2) . for boosters you have;
---
celebration booster i have allot stacked up, experience booster from the candy corn gobbler, black lion boosters from statuettes, guild wvw exp buff, wvw exp enrichment infusion, its something like 250% total im too lazy to add it up, i get like 40 ranks a week, 60-80 if its a bonus week. also so many reward tracks helped make the weapons, and ive finished nearly all the weapons and armors from season 4 from all of it.
---
I'm trying to get mastery points for POF. I'm not very good at that tho lol
---
I'd say you can still consider it spoiler if it's poping up in unexpected places but spoilers about a previous episode in an email about the current one is not at all unexpected.
---
OP was saying the way Kralk was portrayed in this map is a reference to how he was portrayed in the GW1 map. The modeling is nearly identical.
---
Funny, most of my guild is busily playing in the zone. Of course, not everyone in my guild has maxed every mastery in the first place, but then a lot of people who have, already have so many spirit shards that the five days it takes to get the mount aren't going to really set us back anyway.
---
I agree that the collection shouldn't be gated, but you've got a really weird guild if people are not playing in order to get spirit shards in other zones. That would represent a relatively small percentage of the population in my opinion.
---
Gonna echo what others are saying, the story is a great way to keep your adventure going. It unlocks new reward tracks, new mounts (in season 4), new maps, and introduces some great characters. Bless the devs for making the story order easy to follow. Just go to your story journal and go top to bottom.

How many spirit shards per piece do you know?  I'm sitting on thousands
---
Per character
---
There were when this episode started being developed.
---
Yo I really enjoyed the leylines, I was pleasantly surprised to find one underneath me.
---
I may have misunderstood the exp gain thing, as it read to me as "it's a waste of exp to do the new map, since we can't gain anything in the track as long as it is locked, not even spirit shards". Sorry if it was confusing.
---
That's why I asked
---
&gt; Wasn't there a tech developed to change this so that you get Spirit Shards as long as the tracks are locked?
---
&gt; We were told the mount was releasing today
---
Released is something differently than being acquired. It was released "today" as you being able to work for it "today" but you won't get it until you complete the time-gated things.
---
&gt; All experienced gained in the map is null as you cannot put anything towards the mount mastery reward track.
---
If your only problem is that you don't get the EXP for the mastery track then I must strongly disagree with you. IMO it doesn't really matter that much because you get the EXP either way at some point to max it, if you do it like saving up the Daily boxes then you will unlock all of the mastery tracks in a very short amount of time.
---
However, If your problem actually is that you don't get ANY EXP, so not even to the next Spirit Shard then I have to agree. This is a long persisting problem or issue that has been discussed for a long time now since HoT came out with no change in sight.
---
&gt; Anyone who has maxed PoF masteries will avoid the new map / content due to wasting effort.
---
Why? You got still stuff to do. Just because you don't be able to earn EXP on Mastery tracks that you will unlock either?! This is like saying that anyone who have Fractals 100 unlocked will not play Fractals anymore.
---
&gt; My friends and I took today and tomorrow off work to enjoy the content and we got slapped in the face with a time-gate.
---
I'm sorry but that is your own damn fault or miscalculation. Time gates are in the game since Ascended gear was released and were in almost every release. If you actually take a day off to play the game you can still do that.
---
&gt; Time-gating is compounded for users who can only play for an hour or so a day, due to the extra days required to wait; forcing the requirement to be even more staggering for them.
---
How do you propose to do this then?
---
Time Gates have a reason because there is not really an alternative. You need to slow down the players who are able to play the game constantly because what will happen when you don't? You will have them complete all of the content in maybe a day or two, max a week and then have nothing to do, come to reddit and complain about "The Game is Boring I want more stuff to do"! You already see this happening all the time in players spending thousand of hours in the game and complain about not having enough content to do.
---
You don't lose anything (except EXP which doesn't really matter anyway) through those time gated collections, you are just decelerated from completing them.
---
&gt; Everyone I know has stopped playing PoF content in general because they cannot gain the exp for their effort.
---
Well, how exactly will that fix the "problem"? You won't be able to finish the collection if you don't play the S04E06 Map which is PoF content. And If you are generally active, which I would assume if you and your friends take the day off to play the game, then you wouldn't really care about the EXP. If it is about the Spirit shards then you can basically farm them through Tomes.

In Conclusion, I agree with you that you should gain EXP even if you have a locked Mastery Track. This should be fixed or changed. However, while I also think that time gates are annoying they are really negligible because if you play regularly then you will can just do them when you want. Posts like this seem to always boil down to "I want this thing right now" and if that is possible then you get the complains of "I have nothing to do, implement more stuff".
---
Sounds like you just hate open world in general, then...?
---
The skyscale is a PvE open world mount. It makes total sense that it's tied behind collections that have you doing stuff in the open world. The time gating may be frustrating, but collections are a far better and more suitable acquisition method than throwing a mountain of gold at a heart vendor.
---
yeah they take a bit longer than HoT masteries.
---
Well you're right, but can you call someone a rusher when the story litteraly lasted 30 minutes ?
---
Middle lane iirc
---
Not to sht on your fun and all but the final battle of the meta is basicly Deathwing 2.0 with PoF bounty champions bonus stage .
---
How about some challenging content that requires more than pressing 1 and clicking all the boxes on the map ?
---
We're all upset but timegates keep people logging in even if you were gonna do it anyways :\^)
---
With some other decisions it looks like they just went on reddit and did almost everything everyone was speculating about already
---
But bitterfrost frontier ist the best LS map imo. Kourna on the other hand... Yeah disappointing.
---
when this map is not rewarding for you when you play it, I cant help you. sry.
---
Thanks for thread. I have logged into to GW2 in a few months and the. Ew mount was going to be my enticement back. This thread saved me from being disappointed. Thanks!!!
---
I'll be there to rez you one month into your wait
---
From snowcrows:
---
“Summon Bone Minions can be used and instantly exploded with 
---
Putrid Explosion
---
when you can only auto attack. This will help you stack up on Life Force”
---
[Scroll down to the utility skills section :D](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/necromancer/scourge/condition/) 
---
Also please don’t play condi classes if possible in fractals. Condi classes are not “discretize meta in anyway”. Power is much better in the short, burst oriented phases while condi classes struggle to build up any condis.
---
It might be ok in low levels, but the highest levels of fractals will demand power classes. Consider power reaper if you really want to play necro. It’s not as great as the meta options (Weaver soulbeast dragonhunter) but it’s still a great option!
---
Again, this isn't about the shards.  It's the fact the collections make you participate in events yet you are throwing exp in the gutter if you have no other mastery tracks unlocked for PoF.  I only put the spirit shard mention in there because many in my guild gave the map up to go to Tyria or HoT maps so they would at least get experience, instead of no experience at all.
---
OOF!
---
No, I don't hate open world. I hate when the devs treat me like an idiot, developing an single player game disguised as an MMO.
---
Anet just went full Marvel with throwbacks.
---
Thank you very much! Glad you like it. Anet did a great job building the relationship between Aurene and the commander.
---
ALSO: no Kasmeer and Majory, who were supposed to track Kralkatorrik the whole time. Guess they were just busy planning theirs and Rytlogans double wedding ceremony.
---
there are people that love rushing and don’t complain, this collection is big anyway, but that lvl of timegate, when it’s not item or event, but the collection itself, makes me really sad.
---
Preach. They need to keep this design going forward
---
THANK YOU!
---
Why do people still play GW2, if every single LW episode brings to reddit 90% complaints and 10% screenshots? 
---
And since when did getting a mount became a race? Should we tell new players that they should not buy GW2 because they can not get Skyscale on day 1 it came?
---
&gt; Released is something differently than being acquired. It was released "today" as you being able to work for it "today" but you won't get it until you complete the time-gated things.
---
Are you serious?
---
&gt; If your only problem is that you don't get the EXP for the mastery track then I must strongly disagree with you.
---
My issue is that my and other people's time is better spent in older content now.  That's pretty backwards.
---
&gt; Why? You got still stuff to do. Just because you don't be able to earn EXP on Mastery tracks that you will unlock either?! This is like saying that anyone who have Fractals 100 unlocked will not play Fractals anymore.
---
What stuff?  Oh you mean the stuff in HoT that, again, has a better reward track than PoF in it's entirety now.  Secondly, don't compare apples and oranges -- Fractals have constant rewards and there is nothing wrong with them.
---
&gt; I'm sorry but that is your own damn fault or miscalculation. If you actually take a day off to play the game you can still do that.
---
Lmao, say that to everyone else who did this after the release announcement without sitting behind a screen, I bet it'll go over well. Seriously, you're just poking at trying to upset me or other people at this point.  When I said "Discuss," I didn't say "Be opinionated and try to be a passive-aggressive dick."
---
I won't bother with the rest of this.  If this post bothered you so much you should have just left it alone to do something more constructive and positive.
---
That's fucking savage XD
---
I like those ideas as well! &gt;\_&lt;
---
you have to. you wont gain EXP anymore and so no new shards.
---
When each episode is being developed for +-9 months, I think it's reasonae to believe there was a Kourna team in the start of the development.
---
Yeah.. 5+ hours grinding out the map getting stuff done aww yeah so into it then booooom. TIMEGATE - THOU SHALL NOT PASS. rip. :( I really dislike these things.
---
I though him saying mother was more of a reference to what he said earlier about Aurene being of him but now him becoming of her. So in a sense she is now is mother. So just him talking to Aurene is my take.
---
Does it require a ton of gold too like the griffon? Haven't played in quite a while. Was thinking about coming back for the dragon but I'm pretty broke
---
It has it all. Insane grind, time-gating, and a mastery track. I wouldn't be surprised if future collections for unlocking it are giant goldsinks too, since as I said this has it all.
---
drops from the chests after the meta event.
---
Whose statue is that?
---
Good artists can do amazing things, even if their tools are not so good.
---
Map meta and armor collections done quite good.
---
I never said it entitled me to anything, but it's their lack of transparency on the issue that convinced myself and others to do so.  We're entitled to be upset, that isn't hard to understand and I don't know why you're twisting it with your own spin.
---
Melandru's. All the sections have statues corresponding to their deities in them.
---
Or maybe they try to do interesting long content instead of lazy time gated game design like its a fucking mobile game.
---
its like cheep version of ice encasement outfit kek
---
OP was sarcastic
---
&gt; What happened to "the player can play how he wants"?
---
That always felt like a lie if you want to play the game a lot in a day (maybe not in HoT days because of all the grind needed). Sure it works for the people playing 30min a day or even less, but that was never true for the players who wanted to invest time in the game.
---
stalling content, the only reason there ever is for this shit.
---
can some one pls update [this overview](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285567024417996801/439066135661379596/trinkets-ls3.png)?
---
Would be good esp. for newer players.
---
&gt;i got more the vibe that EDs aren't just forces of evil but that could mean they were just indifferent to us rather then malicious.
---
Which is what we have been told since before release. So shouldn't really be news.
---
Well tbh i‘d much rather do a conpletely bugged and cancerous treasure Hunt and Distribute the Time invested in the way i wann instead of Arena net doing it for me
---
Maybe they should not have added Skyscale in the same LW as new gorgeous map and interesting legendary, since nobody is gonna play those two for as long as he/she wants SKyscale...
---
Woah, haven't been on new map, but I really need to find Lyssa part this evening.
---
I got that impression too, but that begs the question: why did he do it if he wasn't evil? Was it because of her prophecies, of her knowing there is a future of a world without him in it? Was it the fear of said future or did he feel betrayed? So many questions, we need answers!
---
are you timegating people's complaints? lol
---
at the traveling elonian near the way point in the new map
---
If you want to be the mother of dragons you have to do the mother of all collections
---
yup. Also OP is chrono main so animations are a big thing when you don't look on your skill bar for rotations and skill activation
---
for some reason they use WvW mats for PvE recipes but not PvP ones (or much less at least).
---
Theres also better use for them in WvW then PvP.
---
What extra's do the S2-3-4 living world bring?  
---
Is it just a storyline that i'll have missed or does it actually bring skills/gear that I really need for other endgame content?
---
Amen. Quite disappointed.
---
And that is exactly why it feels good to explore in the new map: you have both options.
---
A little from column A, a little from column B.
---
there is a button to decent it's C
---
Big Thanks.
---
to all of that: yes, especially number 2
---
Wait, wait, wait... if you cannot progress Skyscale collections instantly, you cannot play the game? I mean - there is a whole new map in there!
---
That's a pretty shit reason still and I accounted for it already, 5 days of waiting is still nothing in 3+ months of no new content.
---
F
---
Oh? I tried this, well I have to look at my key bindings, maybe that was the problem, thank you :)
---
Ah, I see. 
---
I looked around for a ways to spend PvP mats, but found nothing. WvW mats can buy you a whole ascended set, so there's that.
---
Imagine Europeans finishing egg collection on release day well past bedtime 10 minutes after reset. Well it is more like return to the game after tomorrow.
---
Because it's the same dragon, just like iron man looked the same in avengers as he did in iron man.
---
It's not a reference, just consistency.
---
I hope the xp lockout gets fixed. I personally couldnt care less but I see why it would bother plenty of other people.
---
There is none. Only three of the gods are referenced in the map this way
---
Yeah, he's not as big as he could have been and the head in this episode is smaller than in the last one, and that was was definitely smaller than the end of PoF, but it was probably to fit him into the play space, and he also didn't have his storm.
---
But I still think they recaptured that gw1 feeling of scale and seeing him for the first time.
---
Get Dunked
---
I was totally happy with the way these last 3 episodes unfolded. Prophecy of doom, prophecy seems like it might not come to be, then comes to pass anyway, then is subverted.  
---
They did a really good job of making me believe we were going to win last episode, and i was suitably crushed when it turned into a last minute defeat with seemingly all hope lost.  
---
This episode unfolded basically how it had to. We were never going to fail, the world was never going to end, and aurene (since she's crucial to those two points) was never going to stay dead. Those were absolute givens based on the story thus far.  
---
The only thing i think was slightly hamfisted was kralk turning out to not be some all-consuming evil, and i say that only because it's such a cliche plot-twist. The way they executed it was good, and it added some depth of emotion to the final fight.  
---
The only question i'm left with is, "what about the others?". Why was Mordremoth so destructive? we saw into his mind, surely we would have seen the same kind of torment that Kralk was afflicted with. Why was Zhaitan so evil, when he wasn't 'tainted' by any magics other than his own flavour?  
---
I don't really expect them to clear up those points, though.
---
I don't like timegating, but this sounds like devs trying to buy a couple more days before Reddit fills with "I'm bored! Next episode when???!!!" threads.
---
Literally me. I busted a vessel and now I'm salty shitposting on reddit because I have to wait an extra 24h....
---
yall complain but honestly these grinds are what make the item even more valuable once you have obtained it. you don't need the item RIGHT NOW so what's the harm in a super long (harmless) grind? 
---
we obtained the others relatively easily and if this were a last mount mechanic why wouldn't you make a super grind in a MMO of all places. Fck the grind im down, as long as I won't have to pay 250g il play my fckn mmo to obtain it, the journey to my griffon was half the fun, took me a whole damn day I won't regret.
---
Might from Overload Fire only hits 5 people, so that doesn't help your other subgroup. The only might that double-counts across all 10 is from the shouts, and even then you can't just multiply it by 2 unless you include SoI since the shout cooldowns and might duration don't line up with Heat Sync. (If you use Heat Sync when that might is only 5 seconds left... then it only copies those stacks of might for 5 seconds.)
---
You're way short.
---
PRAISE JOKE
---
None so far, but we've only seen 2/5 parts. Hoping no because with this massive collection+timegating adding a gold sink into all of it is a right kick in the nuts.
---
Yes it makes it possible, but i think it would feel better if you could use the mouse to get down faster than using the button, but not as precise  like it it now but it could be a little bit more precise :)
---
Thanks for this. I got my ascended condi scourge up and running before I took a break, now I get to reset everything back to power for reaper (I like the greatsword better anyway).
---
My pc is running at about 5 degrees higher since the update
---
They literally said "we won't spoil the acquisition for you". Now we all know why because people would tear them apart for it
---
New map has a lot to do! This is exactly primary example of what Teapot says. The community is sadly full of people like you who somehow feels to get rewarded for playing  by shinnies, which this map does, and yet people moan.  There will never be a win with you guys, so I would recommend Anet to stop listening to yours opinion in the matter. This is the best map and episode content wise in the whole season! It comes even from the team who had mixed releases in the past with unfinished maps and lack of something interesting to do! We should give them the credit were they deserve and this episode is it. Map feels polished, global map meta!, no fcking repeatable hearts, and gorgeous to look at, great lore and story telling, legendary that deserves it's naming with all the details put in to it, upgrade able armor set that is exactly what community asked for, heavy pants, no medium buttcape, new awesome and polished mount. And yet is as" any other LS"? Fuck off dude.
---
So you are saying that people were just hanging around with Aurenes body for several months before suddenly deciding to bury her? And Kralkatorrik basically taking a break from eating everything for the same amount of time? 
---
It is quite clear that not much time have passed between end of Episode 4 and start of Episode 5.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I think after Kormir gave her "See you later, fuckers" speech redux, they gave up and left us to sort out everything.
---
Send items plz!
---
Can I have your stuff ?
---
they're not ment to be equals, griffon is like a plain, fast &amp; straitforward, here we got a precise air mount
---
Anyone else remember that manifesto video?
---
Taimi generally annoys me at most times, but even I enjoyed her getting a little too into the cannons.
---
Please no, I can't handle the gold sink ON TOP of all of this...
---
You should re-read what he said. The choices were Aurene not being dead OR a deus ex machina, and they went with Aurene not being dead.
---
just because that one collection you have no reason to play again... I'mean it's silly but ok :P   
---
PS I hate time gating mechanics as well :P
---
&gt; potentially Bitterfrost Frontier too
---
No
---
holy shit this
---
I hated timegating in WoW ever since it started and especially now. I ALWAYS praised gw2 for not timegating but no matter how hard something is you can do it in your own time and with diligence. This one broke me...
---
To correct one thing. It is literally impossible to unlock the mastery in less than 5 days, so it ain't just one day of XP wasted
---
&gt; Glint even indicates he was evil and the whole reason destiny edge was sent to kill him.
---
And why do we assume that Glint was good?
---
Enjoy being an a-hole! :D
---
It’s Daenerys
---
Massive collections? I'm fine with it. Scavengers hunts ? I'm all for it if there are hints. Playing events and shit to get it? Let's go! Gold sink? Everything has a price. Time gate ? Fck off!
---
&gt; The episode seemed a little short storywise, no?
---
I figured for an ending, it would have more story cutscenes after the epilogue. I'm wondering with the title "The End" and all of the layoffs at Anet, if this really was the ending to the game.
---
The only thing that interests me is the Mother. Making kralk the tormented one seems wrong as if that is true nature of elser dragons we should have discoveres it long time ago with Pale Tree and Mordremoth.
---
Making Kralk tormented victim is probably a last second twist they came up with.
---
Yh a map we saw 5 times over just doing the 1st fucking part.   
---
So because it's not bugged or p2w we should abolish anet of all critique? Sorry but this mount is aids and so is your opinion
---
I understand the point you are trying to make, I only think the direction you are being upset at is the wrong one.
---
Sure you can be upset but you made it sound more like it is the games fault that you took the day of and now are not able or don't want to play the content. I mean, would you also blame the game if the server went offline and you couldn't play. What I'm trying to say is that when you make plans to play at patch day then you should expect that things won't go smooth as you expect them to be, this happened here. You expected to get the mount directly, that didn't happen so you either made a mistake or you should accept it the way it is.
---
Also, You repeatedly mentioned that the EXP are a factor that people stop playing the content and yet you don't care about the EXP, so why would you or they stop playing if you don't care or are you just assuming this? Stopping to play will solve nothing really instead of increasing your own frustration for a longer period of time.
---
I also didn't say that you don't appreciate the content I just wanted to point out the flaws in your arguments.
---
Look, I agree that the "don't get EXP when you have locked masteries" is an oversight and had to be addressed for a long time now. You are generalizing the issue in such a way that your arguments losing what you are trying to say. So for example, you say that everyone who has maxed Masteries will avoid the new map because they would "waste effort", yet here I am, max mastery level and will still play the map. Spirit shards are always a rare currency if you invest in them more but there are ways to get them through tomes. The problem is that everyone wants everything right now. When the latest armour came out everyone complained about the prices being so high because they wanted to get it directly. The same happens right now with the exact same principle, As soon as you have the mastery unlocked you earn the EXP and the Spirit shards again or you just farm Tomes.
---
I do understand your criticism but you are blowing it way out of proportion.
---
PRAISE JOKO!
---
I love the combination of the essence, mounts and gliding.
---
It makes traveling around the map so much more fun.
---
&gt;I know my 107 TP to Friend stones will last the duration of Gw2.
---
Look at Mr Popular here with all his friends.
---
do the events for the medicine have to be done in one go, or can be spread among days?
---
i don't remember, i couldn't see the price on the vendor yet but my friend could. i think it was around 100 or in the hundreds, so you should be fine. that's like 2k or so for the whole set
---
I think they actually made lazy mistake. Instead of usual crafting timegate or heart timegate that you can do any time, they went for server reset. Witch in theory is the same thing, but can punish people who literally passed reset second ago and perception is way differ.
---
Isn't everything about GW2 a reference to GW1 though.
---
Might be a long shot, but have you verified that your refresh rate is correct? I’m guessing that could have been adjusted during some of the driver transitions, and you may be on a rate that your monitor will display, but not properly. I’ve seen this style of stuttering when dealing with video, and wonder if your perhaps you’re running at 30hz or 50hz on a 60hz. Does this issue present itself on the desktop if you click and drag around a large window?
---
I do. Because I make like 500g with \~300 of them.
---
He wasn't evil then, he was just doing what he does. The Dragons eat magic, and turn the world towards them. The six do so in balance, so the world's magic disappears and then leaks out again for another cycle. Glint trying to kill him would upset that all, and send the world into the same disastrous spiral we caused, just with another Dragon in Kralkatorrik's place.
---
My only issue with all that stuff is that kralk was supposed to be a bad guy way before we started killing things and release tons of magic. I never played gw1 or read any books but as I got it, we have no evidence of that kind kralk that encourages aurene in the final instance. So what actually pushed him from being indifferent to malicious in the first place?
---
And yet if they added more story to it, it would take far far longer and people would consume it only a bit faster, plus it would cost a lot more money due to stuff like voice acting. 
---
You have to look at the baseline of how many hours and how much money it costs to produce each hour of story, as compared to how much money/time it costs to produce a scavenger hunt type quest.
---
The story, no matter how long they make it, even if they made it 50% longer, it's not going to be nearly the time people would put into a decently hard collection which is much cheaper to make.  Many people will only do the story once anyway and not everyone cares about the story. A lot of people play only for the reward and as such, getting a couple of days playtime of the episode is worth more to the game than getting 50% more story, but 50% more story is likely far more expensive. 
---
Easter egg hunt is part of what adventure games are about and some people like that as well...I'm one of them. 
---
Would I like more story? Sure I would. But I'm not sure that adding more story wouldn't set the schedule for the next story further back anyway.
---
people really wanna play the game as few as possible uh?
---
Not so fast there OP, there's gonna be event limits too apparently in pt.2
---
God, I miss the old voice actor already! After seven years I'd grown quite attached to the way my character sounded, and this less-gruff american-tinged accent is *jarring* and breaks immersion significantly. ): arenanet you dun goofed.
---
PRAISE JOKO
---
Time gating always was a shitty solution, and I will always hate it. It's artificial, boring and annoying. Let people play with their own pace. If it's a huge gold sink like a Griffon I'm fine with it, you should earn stuff not get it for free, But this is just cheap.
---
Commander: Taimi! Activate instant kill mode!"
---
*Taimi's eye's glow red*
---
Taimi: instant kill mode activated 
---
It's my wish that we can to see/hear more of this. For Christ sake, scruffy could 100% support murder mode Taimi
---
They were moving away from timegates and were using map currency to get collections, kourna and jahai both had collections which needed thousands of the map currency. It made it so it was timegated but you could get around it with multiple characters and progress as much as you are willing. I don’t mind timgates as a whole it just means do the little bit you need for that thing that that day and move on but this collections is very much the style I don’t like which interact with 50 things and takes a while, I’m hoping the next few days are more interesting. A few things to think about though, you only have to do it once, day one of the collection had a much shorter time to do it since since reset was like 7 hours after release, guides are advisable but after day one are more available (I’m usually a try it yourself first kind of person but collecting 50 things in a day, in a brand new map, where the clues become vaguer at least they weren’t as bad as mursaat tokens).
---
I missed the window by 15 minutes so I will have to work on other stuff today, that’s what I get for eating./s
---
Thanks! Take a look!
---
I love that even helmet for once looks awesome on charr (at least medium upgraded one, didnt check for unpgraded yet)
---
SAME! I never thought I'd get to hear that awesome song again in game!
---
What on earth are you going on about? Istan has 3 WPs. Sandswept and Kourna each have 2, and Jahai Bluffs and Thunderhead Peaks both have 4.
---
I'm not in front of the game right now so I can't check, but if memory serves, DF has 4 WPs which are actually really conveniently located. On top of that, you get three temporary 'bonus' waypoints that pop up during the event.
---
So, while there are never less than 4 waypoints on the map (providing you've unlocked the permanent ones), there are up to 7.... on a living world map.  
---
For comparison's sake, there hasn't been a map with 7 WPs since HoT. That's considering all maps released in LWS3, PoF and LWS4. 
---
tl;dr
---
We get a map with 4 permanent WPs. No LWS4 map has more than 4 WPs. In addition, there are up to 7 WPs during meta, which exceeds the 16 maps before DF. Yet, somehow, you're complaining about the lack of fast travel options???
---
The Draconis Mons jumping puzzle is just a giant sequence of really long blind gliding sections. It's by far the worst designed jumping puzzle in the game.
---
In Ember Bay, you can at least see where you're going for most of the jumps.
---
At one point in the story, you unlock the ability to hop onto any of the skyscales standing around the map, similar to how you could with the griffons.
---
The only information anyone has so far is about the first two achievements. (the first three steps are all a part of the first one)
---
Oh I understand. Thank you for explaining it to me!
---
Yeah, but when he said that, you could clearly hear the sound of sea waves. I think he references Bubbles.
---
On the left i have the 3 salvage kits, then the 5 permanent contracts, the portal scroll to the mist/fractal place, perm mystic forge conduit, tell to friend, revival orb, some food, fractal omnipotion, candy corn gobbler,
---
yeah 6 months later 2 hours gameplay and quit. thats all for gw2. no raid, no dungeon...
---
Ca you motivate me how these hard time gates are good game design?
---
What if they had done everything they wanted to do in the game and hoped this patch would give them something to do again but, seeing that collection, and not wanting to bother, they end up having nothing to do again? Ain't silly mate, just logical.
---
Yea i did both cms, all t4 and recs, was about 20g a day. if optimized it was roughly one legend per month, 2 if i was insane and did other things like farm metas, and the armors were not that bad as its just t6 mats.
---
There are achievements that each give you an armor piece (well, a box with your choice of armor weight), and apparently the VM vendor by the main WP will sell you the upgraded versions once you unlock the base version of an armor piece (no idea the cost, though. I haven't unlocked any yet).
---
Thanks. On the top row, I see permanent bank, repair, mystic, extractor... then what are the next three?
---
Exactly, I've been telling my partner, who completely quit the game  after PoF came out, how every living story update is a cookie cutter repeat of the same busy work in a slightly different skin.
---
&gt; I like it, having a antagonist who is evil just because he is evil is very boring.
---
Was Joko that boring ? He had no further motive than personal power and glory, with a drop of sadism.
---
Why even play at all, give us bots that play for us so that we can just sit in front of the screen and watch the game getting played.
---
Terrible on the storytelling and pacing... what?! I haven't noticed till now how delusional you actually are if you have audacity to throw such statements without any arguments to back it up around. I'm done speaking with you, waste of time to even try to.
---
Its like winning a lottery! But hey, meteor wont strike the same place twice right?
---
do u have stockholme syndrome or smth
---
Time-gating or not, the whole thing IS hours of flying in random places and pressing F anyway. The time-gating just makes it even more so of a chore.
---
This is sad you gotta be explained this. How did we end up with such people? Where are we going to go with them?..
---
Most excellent. Ty
---
It would take a while without a guide, especially on the sick sky scales and eggs. I did the scales without a guide but even that took a little while. Also note that the mount is time gated and the next collection only unlocks the next daily reset after finishing this first full collection. I'd say try the scales on your own and then look up a guide.
---
Well, if the name tag is supposed to be x pixel above a model, a model with 0 night and width (a dot) will be ground level

Wait, you actually need other LS4 maps AND Bitterfrost Frontier? I mean, I'm thankfully in the camp that has all of those, but if that's true, that's way overkill and locking players from a mount they were promised until they pay for the LS4 maps and LS3E3 AND HoT to play LS3.
---
You are totally wrong sir, this map have one waypoint, 50% of the time. Other 3 are not unlockable, you must do the escort events for them, and they are temporary. So when someone like me working on mount collections, teleport to a new map, there is one waypoint, only one. And for for the mount collections you need to waste 10 min to go them. You can be a good Samarian and to the escort for others to use waypoints, but it will cost you 15 more min for each. And you never know what map you teleport to. If you are lucky you go to a map with waypoints, if not there is no waypoints. Last night I got 3 times to no Teleports maps, half of hour walking, and one lucky map with all 3 up. That's what I talk about.
---
Glint is not his mother as far as i know
---
You are not supposed to skip mobs but kill them. If you still want to skip them, then.....what about.....ingame skills? For example stealth?
---
I'm guessing it only works on mobs that actually drop loot, correct?
---
How do I check if I have LS unlocked?
---
Play.
---
Whatever it takes.
---
What Kralk said in the battle scene was interesting. Most people seem to think there is a mother of the fragons out there.
---
I sort of took it as when he said mother he was talking to Aurene. He said something like she was of him, and now he will be of her. He also said that death holds no fear for elder dragons, and that she will be the first of her type.
---
Maybe there is something like reincarnation with the dragons. Aurene gives birth to a reincarnated Kralk, this time maybe he can be moulded differently.
---
F*ck joko, long live the queen aurene!
---
I haven't got any issues during the 4 hours I've played since the patch.
---
I mean, the difficult traveling is what I love bout it, theres actualy some interesting strucute that you need to learn, rather than just holding W all the time
---
Istan and LS4 maps (do metas, do dailies, salvage gear*, use volatile magic to buy shipments and resell what you get). The Dragonfall meta was very profitable this morning (especially if you need lots of mithril for mithrillium to make deldrimor steel).
---
Silverwastes (tag all events, do chest farms, open "bags of gear" on level 52-ish character. 
---
T4 fractals, raids and PvP all give a steads supply of income.
---
\* Whether or not to salvage gear is constant debate, with out of date resources. My personal opinion is that it drops huge amounts of mithril and silk, which I needed for ectoplasmic refinement so it made sense to salvage it to prevent me from having to buy more in the future.
---
I wish more franchises had such feel-good fan service.
---
If you meant decent,  you're the one who do not understand things, and don't want to understand. People hate it for a good reasons, this thread and this subreddit is full of for who wants to see it. Time gating is shit, and has nothing else going for other than artificially extending the play time of people. That's not how you should do it. If you want people to stay for longer and play more you should engage them with quality content. Which this patch actually do providing great meta and rewards with it. So the time gating of a new mount was a mistake as time gating anything always is. The main reason I haven't done the Aurora and won't is the bloody backpack. It's shit and not fun to play.
---
There are so many things ArenaNet did right with this release, and I think they deserve the praise and that they will hopefully use the community feedback going forward.
---
- Masteries from HoT and LWS3, was a breath of fresh air in terms of exploration.
---
- the meta is fun, rewarding and takes cooperation
---
- The skyscale collection gave us some much desired grind back to the game.
---
Honestly, I feel like this release took everything HoT did right, and fused it with everything PoF did right. We’ve been talking about Anet having to find the balance between these to expansions, and this episode was a great result of that!
---
&gt;The game prides itself in "play how you want"
---
Oh, right. Also "no trininty", "no quests", "update every 2 weeks", etc. I'm not even going to ask "where are we going to go with it", because we are already there. "Play how you want" specifically led to hamsterwheels of sw/istan and almost everything in the game being achievable by the simple gold grind. How exciting.
---
People in masses don't know what is good for them, but somehow this subreddit only starts to remember that when it comes to lootboxes.
---
I was referring to the 
---
&gt;I pray you will never have to kill one you love
---
line specifically.
---
Personally I didn't connect that line to his final word.
---
Yea i agree, i mean it is still nice to see consistency too but reference is something else. Also iron man changes suits all the time so maybe a better example would be how a lot of the places in Tyria in GW2 look identical to exact same places in GW1. Not a reference just consistency.
---
Or if we look it from other side..you could say majority of gw2 is a "reference" to gw1 then. :P
---
YOU DIED.
---
That was one of his lies to the people, same way he killed Zhaitan and Mordremoth singlehandedly.
---
The main thing I'm uncertain on is the timeline. In order to be relevant to overall lore Kralk would have needed to suffer the pain and madness when he first became an ED or shortly thereafter but the avatar and aspects we fight imply the pained craze only started when we killed Zhaitan at the earliest, more likely at the end of PoF.
---
As others have said that would still leave him an irredeemable evil/monster for creating the Brand, killing Glint and just generally being an uncaring Elder Dragon. It does explain the feeding frenzy during LS4 though and why he went from conquering and hoarding to outright omnicidal destruction.
---
One thing this makes very clear though is that even if we still consider them evil EDs **can** be reasoned with **if** given an incentive to engage with us.
---
a theory i saw on the forums which i thought was interesting is that perhaps this had something to do with the fact that the forgotten tried to cleanse him.

I saw the map when doing story, map completion, collecting scales, looking for sick skyscales and collecting eggs. 5 times. I did the meta twice. Since there are no npcs outside of camps there are no hidden dialogs. I saw everything the map has to offer. Anet, do you think I will play on the map today, especially after I missed reset by 20 minutes, therefore preventing me from progressing the collecting until tomorrow? Hell ~~yes~~ no.
---
Or... use a different class?! (it’s basically just pip farming like ranked pvp)
---
You do triumphant reward track x6 and get free exotics (stat selectable)
---
Sooo the exotics will be the start of your new armor set (stat selectable)
---
AFTER that you need to pip farm WvW since it’s 175 wvw tickets + 3 grandmaster marks (per ascended piece).
---
So gradually you swap out ascended gear (also stat selectable) for the exotic you got from the reward track.
---
In this way you will have a new full set of exotic armor (any stats) pretty quickly to use on your character while you unlock the WvW ascended pieces over time.
---
or maybe he has a survival instinct

During the Epilogue, if you go to the lower deck of Sayidas Airship, you can find a book, containing another short story by [Snargle Gold claw](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Snargle_Goldclaw), called [Mist Connections](https://imgur.com/HbL3uns).
---
Lol the WHINING. I bet you're the same person to complain that there's nothing to do after beating the story in every other episode.
---
I actually love Counter Magic mechanics, because it makes fights much more intense even after doing them a billion times. Fights without counter magic are very ZzzZzzzZzzZ in my opinion. Counter Magic keeps you on your toes by adding overlapping dynamic mechanics to a fight that compliment each other so well. If it was just Counter Magic by itself on an enemy with bleh boring easy to dodge/avoid mechanics then yeah Counter Magic would be lame being reintroduced, but when you combine Counter Magic with lots of mechanics that also keep you on your toes it leads to exhilarating fights no matter how many times you've done it.
---
Of course with having said all this, lazy players who are only participating for rewards are obviously not going to be happy about it, and that's a perfect example of why balancing and designing MMOs is much more difficult of a task than people imagine. I am not going to tell people to play how they want, if they want to solely participate for the rewards and are against making fights more high paced and punishing then that is their way of choosing to play the game and that's okay. But there are other players who do not like such things and they should have a voice as well, because even if a part of the community considers something to be un-fun there's another part of the community who loves it so there will forever be a clash.

Saddest moment in gw2
---
Does anyone have a list of the unique items / equipment sold by vendors using Mistborn Motes?
---
&gt;Reincarnation: Elder Dragons come and go. They are replaced by another dragon beings. Overtime huge amounts of magic corrupts them. In this game magic corrupts. We saw that in Bloodstone Fen. Then they also get replaced. It's War Eternal. Neverending fight to keep the harmony in Tyria.
---
That would seem to be at odds with Glint's statement that Aurene's ascension is the dawn of a *new* world. Which to me implies that this is an unprecedented event.
---
Also in meta terms, they've already done the "ancient natural cycle of the world" trope with the Elder Dragons rising and sleeping, would seem a tad uninspired to pull that again.
---
Does this sub have a shitpost/circlejerk counterpart?
---
I have 15k.  I'm fine.
---
I'm not mad, just disappointed.
---
With the War Eternal supply you can select 2 of them. i selected the Star Beetle and Star Raptor.
---
when everything feels like a fucking chore, yeah.
---
I made some markers for the scales that you can use with for [GW2Taco](http://www.gw2taco.com/), never made these before so feel free to copy them and fix any problems: https://pastebin.com/rV6ihWZu
---
Save this as ``collectibles_skyscales.xml`` or something and put it in  ``POIs`` folder to use them.
---
All the coordinates are there, slightly out of order. I can't figure out why they are not able to be disabled though, they also don't go away when using F. If anyone have any fixes for this then post a new pastebin link.
---
What I mean is, instead of buffing already good engineer elites, they should focus on fixing the bad ones first.
---
&gt; Which is what we have been told since before release. So shouldn't really be news.
---
Not on par with what's shown ingame though. Both Zhaitan and Mordy clearly employ torture and psychological warfare and the latter was at the very least vengeful when we killed him. Mordremoth could understand mortals well enough to create temptations and taunting visions at which point "not caring" is about as evil as it gets.
---
OUR Taimi! &lt;3
---
NIce tip, ty mate!!!
---
all i wanted was an interesting and not terribly long collection, like they did before.
---
Why the heck they didn't gave us the mount in the story, and made this collection about unlock a new skin ? If they had done this the entire experience of the episode would have been excellent.
---
This bullshit we were fed before the game was released. Pretty sure Anet are not thinking it themselves anymore.
---
And here we get to the point where arguably, that timegate is asinine. Let the people who have the time grind it out, I don't. Not everyone has time for the collection, so the time gate is an additional kick in the teeth.
---
they start to agro even when u just land, u don’t have time to dodge aoe or get invisible fast enough, but i just play weaver, i guess other classes might be easier for this kind of stuff, but i prefer my commander forever
---
I'd say its a bugged reflection from that mount skin behind it...
---
The guys who have all 37? Legendary weapons AND spam photos of ALL legendary Armors and back packs didn’t just play raids... or do pve...
---
Those players play ALL game modes (up to and including TP flapping).
---
If each legendary was 2k... at 300g per week it’s a phenomenal amount of weeks to just get the minimum gold.. (for weapons only)
---
300x52 wks per year = 15,600
---
37 legendary x 2k each = 74k
---
So it’s easily a 5yr task at 300 per week (no breaks, 52wks per year x5)
---
Take into account you must be PvP rank 100 and the legendary Armor and back pack from PvP is time gate to 5 seasons minimum (yes I know I got it and that’s the fastest it can be done...)
---
PvP seasons are 8wks long (56days) with 14day breaks between... so that’s hundreds of additional hours of PvP per day 
---
ON TOP of keeping up with your 300weekly gains..
---
Now add the WvW legendary armor too?? (2k wvw rank reqs.. all the hours and hours of wvw)
---
Yeah the ONLY way they made all that money and all 37 legendary was to play a lot in all game modes and when I say a lot I mean “A LOT”
---
Also in my opinion it takes more then 300per week to do it in this span since nobody plays 52wks a year for 4-5yrs straight (everyone needs breaks or vacations)... So I also assume the rare rare few who have EVERY SINGLE LEGENDARY (even back all 3 armors in all weights???)
---
Yeah they must be trade post barons as well.. that’s a lot of money to move and an exceptional amount of dedication to format (doing the PvP armor x3 takes 13-15seasons and we are only at like 17 soooo you needed to have played almost every single PvP season to attain all weights)..
---
So yeah I’ve seen some of those epic pics too and wondered (and even ran numbers) How in the F?
---
Numbers don’t lie and it basically says you need more then 300g per week AND thousands of additional hours in WvW and PvP format to have made all those things legit...
---
So I’m thinking the TP barons have easy access to g1 legendary and that’s how they make their money anyway (buying GoM from others.. make legendary.. sell for profit.. so the rich get richer and the mapping guys go back and map again).. That and TP flipping is what gives them enough resources to get there... but no amount of money can buy the PvP or WvW legendary armors so those are truly a measure of dedication far and above the “normal” player.... 
---
Heck I think I’m decent with my full legendary PvP armor and wings (working on wvw set next!)... but hell no that’s nothing compared to what those guys with all 37legs and armors, and all 3 back pieces have done (nor what they invested either).
---
So I say... TP flippers and barons got the easiest path toward completing them but still.. you can’t flip your way to g2 or to the legendary PvP/wvw or the back pieces.
---
It’s truly something special or truly something “legendary” they have achieved (imho).. I know as a PvP/WvW player I’m always impressed when I see all the weight unlocks on the PvP and the wvw armors (it’s months of dedications to those formats as well so dudes don’t just sit as flip to get rich.. Nope they are deadly killers as well it’s for certain)
---
that’s why i’m not using anything that i gather from the map, don’t want to risk it
---
i’m scared u might be right
---
I seriously considered just not playing the game anymore after the whole thing.  Since I got a day of "timeout" due to having completed the first part 10 minutes after daily reset. This is just terrible design and in the whole a very frustrating experience.   Also imagine having this as a pattern from now on. They should make quality content and give people a nice user experience in their product if they want people to keep logging. Not this cheap and lazy method.
---
Base game is free so make a new account for NA servers and see if its worth it
---
Exactly what happened to me. I am re installing ESO right now.
---
this way of timegate or new collection is terrible and makes me angry, because i can’t progress even i little, i can’t check what i need to do next and just do anything at all to progress, just nothing 
---
for me it just feels bad :(
---
Are you defending realism in the game where there are dragons?
---
Its to make the collection look huge, but in reality its just a 20 minute thing.
---
They want to punish the people that want to play in big chunks instead of a little bit every day.
---
For sandwiches!
---
I can hear her shrill voice ringing in my ears.
---
Access on of the “contact Taimi” POIs, like the ones dotted around PoF core. The symbol on map looks like a WiFi signal.
---
Thanks for this guide. It helped me out a massively great deal.
---
Also all the comments of people complaining ate hilarious.
---
GW2 players: this game is dead, no content.
---
Also GW2 players: this free content sucks, how could Anet have wronged us with additional content and things to do to get rewards that cost us nothing but playtime, oh woe are we, how dare they make us actually play the game they worked hard on.
---
Photoshop?
---
Thanks for the tip - hadn't picked up on that! :)
---
It's also a backpack vs a mount that will have tangible gameplay differences for people with it. The ability to dismount without having to find another dragon to remount is huge, the ability to cling to walls and regain flight is huge.
---
The mount actually feels pretty bad to use most of the time because it's built around its masteries. It's like gliding without unlimited endurance and updrafts and the only way to unlock those things is to wait five days. Pants on head stupid.
---
Personally I can manage it- especially with the tip about destroying the towers. But I know others like my partner who struggle more will be put off from the map for the such reasons. And I saw lots of people finding their bearings still on yesterday's map during that event. But outside of time pressured events I fully agree the map is amazing!
---
Well yeah why not, if the end is something I don't mind. 
---
But in that case that's terrible, from an epic fight with an important dead figure ( Aurene is THE story since HoT ) we're going to a fast and stupid rez we're all expecting into 5 minutes of fighting trash mob.
---
And here we are Kralk is not that bad, Lyssa or whatever the godess/alien he's tied to is her mother, ok bye, see you in 6 months for another 15 minutes of Tami speech about dragons, we're into that since Scarlet death.
---
I'm sorry but I've no feeling at all. If you can't give a meaning to the dragons storyline without waiting 5 years with false/bait plot, tease me Cantha with a random bad guy ( like Balthazar was for Elona ) that's still gonna be better than this stucked plot.
---
PoF and LS4 ( not the end ) was better for only one reason, fan service non tied with the stucked dragons plot, Kralk was just a pretext.
---
( Sorry about engrish )
---
Uhh, not really. The Elder Dragons are still an intolerable threat to life on Tyria, and when they wake up it tends to have cataclysmic effects to boot.
---
Not to mention we already have a dangling plot thread with Braham, his bow and Jormag. Dropping the Elder Dragon plotline would be absolutely awful.
---
There is no need to do all events in one go. The vendors will be permanently unlocked account wide once you finish achievements for each of 3 zones.
---
How is the meta event please? Heard mixed things about the last few, would be really cool to have something to farm.
---
Someone new, maybe no one. None of the gods are on or near tyria anymore. We'll never find out.
---
I would still prefer if resurrected Aurene had some of his character traits.
---
Dolyak bites? No apple?
---
As someone who has played the franchise since release of GW1 I never really viewed the Elder Dragons as inherently evil and more like a beast.
---
Their whole being was to control the flow of magic in Tyria which got out of whack and more into extremes than balance because of their awakening cycle but it always showed them more as a wild beast that does what they do to survive, feed on magic and then hibernate until they are "hungry" again.
---
Zhaitan pretty much behaved like this in which he sent armies out to bring him magical items he could feed upon. Mordremoth, on the other hand, had more interaction between the player character and him in his mind. He unveiled some information like that Tyria will destroy if they don't bow to the dragons.
---
We also knew that Dragon Magic can corrupt other beings and too much magic can make you go insane.
---
However, I never thought about this revelation. As I said, I viewed them more as more intelligent but still wild beasts that didn't concern themselves with "ants" likes us until we got in their way and didn't think about that they also could have been corrupted or even formed into this way or behaviour because of the immense magic they consume and "digest".
---
This makes me question if maybe they were like Aurene at first and by accident, or even on purpose, were corrupted or went mad by the magic they were feeding on.
---
When we went into Kralkatorrik to finish him off Aurene says something like that the magic inside of him is conflicting or colluding with each other which could either suggest the internal struggle the Kralkatorrik had with his own madness or that this could be a hint that the reason of this conflict was because of different types of magic.
---
Nonetheless, If it has something to do with the quantity or the purity of the magic then this will, sooner or later, also happen to Aurene unless she is some sort of catalyst or even absorbs the magic in its un-corrupted way.
---
All in all, it opens up a lot of new questions which IMO is a very good thing because it adds a huge amount of possible lore to the game.
---
I opened the email instinctively because it mentioned the mount.
---
I agree... Me and most of my guildies don't even have HoT and/or PoF masteries fully finished, and yet we didn't stop playing those maps.
---
And to be honest - spirit shards aren't really that useful.
---
I saw the mention of the mount and opened it. Then got nailed by the info in big writing. My post wasn't to complain, it was just a small warning in case someone else is in the same position.
---
I agree, reviving her in the first instance of the episode was a bit too soon. I would have loved if they built it up more... but I don't know how? Maybe the commander could have had the talks with the other nations about how we failed and that we don't know what to do. He then gets a vision from aurene, a faint glimpse of her being alive and decides to go back to her... something like that. 
---
I don't know, I'm no writer. But it felt like there was something missing in the beginning.
---
Normally I'd be bothered by how short it was, but I like when games have the climax arc be the shortest one. We already did so much last episode.
---
This episode is also heavily reliant on engaging with the stuff happening outside the story instance to tell part of the story. Logan meeting with Gwen, the Elonian armies taking the different domains and building an assault force all leading up to the meta event "killing" Mordremoth's body, which is referenced in the final story instance before we go inside of him.
---
It's probably the best way to tell these stories and it worked well in HoT, I think it worked well here.
---
The echo effect + the explosion vfx were so absurd I laughed out loud
---
new raid currency im guessing
---
I said that, because Kralkatorrik's torment, said "your world will end", seeming as if he wanted it to end, but maybe you are right. Maybe they just want to consume it's magic and the destruction is just collateral damage. But with the last episode, it seems like there are more things about the Elder Dragons we are yet to find out. We will see.
---
Aurene is now *a star to guide us.* Heh. Foreshadowing from 2 episodes ago.
---
Yeah, my favourite part of the ending is that there is no hook - no big throw to the next season or story. It's refreshing to think the story can go anywhere and deal with anything now.
---
But we know from the latest episode that he didn't fear death, and Aurene as much as says that Glint misinterpreted his reaction to seeing that future. Maybe he knew that the only way to bring balance was for Aurene to kill him, so killed Glint to set the events in motion? I dunno. It feels like they just ignored his previous behaviours in order to have a touching moment for Aurene.
---
The biggest challenge would be how to not give up, as the characters were about to. They would just spend time with their loved ones, waiting for the world to end. But Aurene's vision from the mists, could give them back hope. 
---
&gt; ther than that I really liked the episode and how they presented it.
---
I agree. The rest was amazing!
---
Raids have a decent drop rate of ascended gear, but you need to have a full ascended set first to do it pretty much. They can also let you buy rings and accessories, which are not craftable. But most of all: skins.
---
What are you talking about? I was joking about his character being bald and dumb, and loosing the "bald" part. 
---
As for Cantha, didn't they say that there will be no Cantha?
---
probably annoyed at the fact we keep attacking him and doing serious damage to him.
---
like how you would want the world of really aggressive wasps to end
---
This is the most beautiful part of Tyria, I feel. Makes sense, given that it was ripped straight from Melandru's domain.
---
Wtf spoiler. Come on man
---
I don't follow the story and personally don't care much, but if this was indeed a spoiler you're kind of a dick
---
how do i remove archdps or build template so that they don't crash my games? I heard that it's crashing with the new expansion?
---
No. [It's coming from Blizzard](https://www.diablowiki.net/The_Horadric_Hamburger).
---
Elder dragons destroy the world by accdient really, they just get hungry and start to eat magic which in process kills billions of “ants” on the way. They are a part of the magical cycle of Tyria which keeps magic balance incheck. So they are not “good” nor “bad” they just are, and we are insignificant to them unless we disturb them in their process of eating. They are bassiclY at the top of the food chain of magic and thats really it, idk why people assumed we should have symphatized with kralkatorik i mean he wiped out races of Tyria for eons, before he had that torment in him (which was created due to balthazar, mordy and Zaithan dying).
---
Mesmer is pretty weak while leveling, arguably the weakest of all classes while leveling.  It gets a lot better at 80.  Stick it out, you won’t regret it..
---
Collections are by far the most boring thing in GW2 for me. I hate how much Anet rely on them for content.
---
&gt; P.S. without much attention to my rotation or optimisation I’ve managed to hit up to a burst of 28k dps/s. This is low for a burst I know, my sustained dps/s is as low as 14k/15k. But I’ve not optimised it yet. Any hints or comments on builds are also welcome.
---
What's your setup for that ? Buffs, food, where did you register that DPS ?
---
u can already fly the "rental" ones in dragonfall ;)
---
Does anyone know the colors the Crystal Bloom guys are using? Some sort of white, a greenish blue (Oasis, maybe?) and a faint purple (Glint's Rebellion?). Would be cool if someone knew it, especially the greenish blue.
---
I believe that there's more to that. i am not sure anymore if they are just eating and we are ants on the way. What we thought we know about the ED may change. In the end, Kral seemed like he actually cared for Aurene. I don't know if his torment was there because of Balthazar and the 2 previous EDs. Maybe, we fought with them, because we were inside Kral. The torment may be older than that. Unless I missed something.
---
"Blocking out the sun" isn't terribly hard for a creature of Kralk's size (within the dragonfall map) to do. He often flew closer to the ground.
---
Still, according to the size of his head used in All or Nothing, his head/neck was larger then Zhaitan's entire body, which is on par with Kirk's enterprise almost :P.
---
Kralk is utterly massive.
---
I'm torn. I enjoyed it at the time, but after musing on it for a while, I think it was a lazy retcon in order to have a touching moment with Aurene.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of a dragon going insane due to consuming conflicting magical facets. It's interesting, opens up story options, it's all good.
---
But it does raise questions about established lore. If the source of Kralkatorrik's torment and his resulting murder/reality destroying spree was the non-crystalline facets (or too much magic inside him in general), then why upon first waking did he immediately fly south to mercilessly destroy his daughter? Why, when Staff looked inside his mind, did he see such chaos and destruction?
---
He shows empathy towards Aurene in this episode, he is depicted as a wise old grandfather, which is great! It fits with the personality traits of the rest of his family and his gift of prophecy. But it doesn't match his behaviour back before any other dragons, gods or bloodstones were tampered with.
---
If Tybalt's death was a spoiler to you, then either you didn't go Order of Whispers on *any* of your characters or you are so far removed from "following the story" that you haven't actually even played the game past Lv60.
---
I felt like the return of Aurene happened too early and ended up being anticlimactic but that's just me. At least they explained it unlike most sources of deus ex machina.
---
She was so pretty at the end.
---
Kralkatorrik did nothing wrong
---
I basically stumbled into it last night and we managed to clear it. You kill three champs at the same time and then run around punching Kralk all over, after that you get a ton of loot and some after-events spawn, you need to kill all of these like 20 after-champs to get the mist shard armour chest.
---
I didn't start on anything. I was directed from Gw2 newsletter to the landing page of the new episode. Lo and behold, "Aurene died".
---
Thanks for putting in the perspective.
---
Aurene is died.
---
Several events before the bosses at the end also give 3 chests each.
---
Praise Joko!
---
I used ArcDPS. I don’t know the exact order, because as I said I wasn’t trying to optimise the build yet. But normally when I get my dps burst I do it in this order; 
---
1. banner drops
---
2. Gs (skill 1)x2 (or however many times, followed by sometimes skill 3 or 5 depends on circumstance)
---
3. activate featherfoot grace
---
4. Gs (skill 2) hundred blades and F1. 
---
Normally by the time I hit the 4 point above I deal a lot of damage. The highest might have been around 26k-28k.
---
But is that important to answer my question?
---
Haven't read the books either, but killing Glint may have been necessary to preserve the balance of Magic. I'm not sure if Glint could have become an Elder Dragon herself, but I have a feeling that Kralk's death would have seeped some of his Magic out to other ED's and that would have doomed all Tyrian existence eventually.  
---
In regards to the Brand, ED's rarely move as is. The Brand is unfortunate but I don't think it makes him evil, it's sad enough that he's just a tool to recycle magic and to think that he'd never move when awake is even worse. We as humans walk outside every day, and even if we'd literally never hurt a fly, sometimes we'll accidentally step on one because we're too damn large. Tyrians are just insects to Kralk, even if he never wanted to hurt us eventually he does just by nature of his power.
---
I did it by killing the spiders near spawn in Arah. It’s a bit dodgy tho and not every kill counts
---
Thief is incredible solo, but staff daredevil is easily the best option. Deadeye as a whole is just kinda cheesy, and so balance wise it's either just gonna be weak in a lot of situations and good in some situations, or they buff it to not be weak and then it'll be overtuned and op. As of now, deadeye (d/d or rifle) has good single target dps, but that's about it. Staff DrD has really good dps and cleave, and if you are soloing, take Invigorating Precision and use your evades right and you pretty much can't die except unless you're tryna solo meta bosses and stuff.
---
Ah sweet, so I just do the meta and I should be set?
---
If you want a flashy trail then get yourself the branded greatsword. The blade shards float with proper animations and you get a cool purple swoosh as you swing it.
---
The branded set is easily pushing into legendary quality.
---
giving how loaded Braham was, she probably told him
---
would also solve why she's not on the airship
---
&gt; Anyone who has maxed PoF masteries have begun avoiding the new map / content due to wasting effort.
---
That's right because XP is the currency players care most about in GW2... what?
---
LWS4 is terrible in terms of rewards. i have just logged in for the unlock and then forgot about it.
---
atleast you could get jewellery from LWS3.
---
I'm referring to the huge spoiler for the previous episode that Aurene died.
---
Well what do you want to do? The thing with GW2 is that you choose your own path depending on what you would like to do. 
---
If you are interested in lore then do the stories in order there is litterally hours and hours and hours of story if you go through all.
---
If you like Fractals (this games dungeons) and/or raids then you some guides up, get the gear, train on the golem in the raid lobby and jump in to the tier 1 fractals and go up to 100. Raids you find in the lfg tool or find a guild that is raiding. 
---
Open world is a big thing in this game. You have all sorts of events. There are world boss events in the core maps, Silver Waste is the gold farm map, HoT maps have meta map events on a schedual that requires hundreds of players to finnish. World completion if you like that. Or just gather nodes and learn about crafting so you can craft your own ascended gear at some point.
---
WvW and sPvP might be your thing. sPvP don't require gear whilst WvW do. Look at guides and get gear and builds for it and learn how to play by doing.
---
Collections, adventures, open up your elite specs by getting masteries in the expansion areas, jumping puzzles, achivements or what ever float your boat or a bit of everything. It is all up to you to decide. Making short and long term goals is a important thing though. So i guess that is were your start.
---
Really cracked me up when they asked Taimi to tell everyone to attack kralk. GOGOGO!
---
Invisible ones, which nonetheless are mentioned when we get to Dragonfall.
---
IF you don't care about spirit shards and have all the PoF Masteries maxed then you don't throw XP away, because then XP is worthless.
---
But Lyssa
---
Yes, I am fully aware of what you are talking about. What does that have to do with my comment? 
---
For your sake I hope you never watch trailers or read a synopsis of something that isn't the very first part of something.
---
I don't mind the time gates, I just mind how long it would take (roughly 5 days). Assuming today was day 1 and the server reset later in roughly 12 hour of this comment in the afternoon is day 2, the last 3 days fall on ones when I work (for reference I didn't take several days off for this, I work compressed shifts so I get half the week off, half the week of hell for 12 hours a day).
---
I'd have to gut some dailies to squeeze in the skyscale stuff, but if the collections require events or the meta I'm fucked until my weekend comes. What would take others 5 days could take me a week and a half.
---
&gt; Personal upset: My friends, myself, and many others took today and tomorrow off work to enjoy the content and we got slapped with a time-gate.
---
Because the mount is the only thing we got in this update...
---
That’s really good! Thanks ANet.
---
Yea can confirm, just did the meta inside augury and it gave the part
---
To be honest I felt sorry for him prior to the episode. Imagine being told a world without you is better. He was more than reasonable to go emo
---
Because whole LS4 is a story. It is not idiotic that in ep6 you see what happened in ep5 because the story continues. It is not a spoiler if it says what happened earlier.
---
You will learn in ep6 what happened to Joko, Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Balthazar. Do you think Anet should remove that parts from final instance, because its a *spoiler* from core story, HoT, PoF and Long Life The Lich?
---
XP is not a relevant reward from events. Karma and the loot is worth much more than the miniscule XP Reward, that needs to be turned into spirit shards, in order for them to be turned into anything that has any worth at all.
---
I wasn't sure what you mean by "landing page".
---
That seems to be a bug. I did it with a party and the other members turned into little blue orbs, floating along and were able to support me with 3 skills (1 dmg, 1 heal, 1 dmg buff).
---
You're a hero.  Thank you very much!
---
Same, but with his vision now coming true and you can hear him talk to aurene like that, it hits hard.
---
Those things can fuck right off. 'Ill go pick up that engram-' WHAM! 'guardian down'
---
It combines all the best parts of the HoT maps.  I thought of Verdant Brink, Tangled Depths, Auric Basin and Dragon's Stand CONSTANTLY while I was roaming around.  It's SO active, there's ALWAYS something happening... and the meta rewards are GREAT.  I can sincerely see this being populated for a good long while.  I played for 9 hours straight and barely realized XD
---
there's an achievement for climbing up to it and talking to Sayida but there's very little up there (taimi and sayida don't have anything to say afaik)
---
That english tho
---
I mean, I think the two of you are arguing points that don't really contradict each other.
---
So if getting the skyscale is the ONLY thing this guy wants to do, in theory, logically, he should *like* that it takes so long. Because as soon as he gets it, he's back to not wanting to do anything. Meaning that a long collection = more playing, essentially.
---
I think that what they're *really* saying is that they expect instant gratification, and when they can't get it, they'll resort to hyperbolic histrionics to complain about how bad their situation really is, to elicit a response.
---
It matters, because I play this game for fun. I don't care about "profit" or shiny unlocks if the way to get there is simply not enjoyable. I can work IRL for that and sell my soul to a corporation and make more / hour.
---
They could foreshadow her return too though.
---
I think it was about the no-hearts on the new map ..
---
I hope next season we get to see his hair at that awkward bob stage
---
Right you have fun thinking that.
---
To be honest this happening after alllll that work you spend doing the collections (and in my case finishing 10 minutes after reset) was kind of just a big "fuck you" at the end of all this.
---
There are some "calling spots" on the map. You can call to Taimi and Sayida. You will ask Sayida if Taimi is alright and you will hear her in the bacground shooting from a cannon and yelling "Die die ahh !". Its reay funny =P
---
I had the biggest smile when I came across a Shadow Monk.  I spent many a night in FoW on group clears and then shard farming on the beach.
---
Or use the tonic that makes you the dragon
---
same, 15min late...
---
And Hail Susan
---
&gt; But is that important to answer my question?
---
Yes, because if we want to find optimization, we have to compare on the same basis, which means exactly the same setup of buffs, stuff and traits. Then only remains the "skill" part to improve.
---
Each one of these that moves aways from the theoretical optimal decreases DPS, it's a cost (that you might very well willingly pay if you want to play a certain way).
---
The only think I have to judge is your number, and it seems it's not usable without having the build written. This one is less than half the best benchmark for the spellbreaker.
---
I'd advise you to write your current build [on this website](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/), and to share the link. Then we can check what's best for open world and group content, and match with what you like playing.
---
*A tiny, whiny subset of people
---
I use mine frequently both in mat promotion and legendaries. Just because you dont, doesn’t make them useless.
---
If he hasn't played since eight months after release, there is also silverwastes and dry top.
---
Are LWS nodes (home instance ones) value for gold? Been playing for just under a year. All characters now in ascended. All gifts made for leggy armour (just 5 more weeks of time gated tickets) Now I got the legendary building bug. For someone who mostly plays WvW and occasionally fractals for gold is it worth me getting these nodes or would I just be holding myself back? Thanks in advance.
---
Anet doesn't really have this supposed obsession though. Zhaitan, Mordremoth, Balthazar, Caudecus and Joko were all major villains who weren't made to be sympathetic. Zhaitan and Mordremoth were both force of nature monsters, Caudecus and Joko were both power hungry tyrants, and Balthazar was a psychopath who wanted to wage a war that would destroy Tyria. There's really nothing about any of these villains that seems like Anet wanted us to feel sorry about them and they make up 5 of the 6 primary villains. What obsession are you talking about?
---
First of all, just because there's a degree of realism expected, doesn't mean that it excuses a useless timegate that serves only to make the content feel bigger.
---
Just because it's worse in another games doesn't excuse the useless timegate either.
---
How about you let people progress at their own pace?
---
That axe looks like an axe that was in Wow. [This one](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/308371-legacy.jpg)
---
It looks fucking awesome tho. It becomes a hammer and an axe
---
RIP Blish
---
Wasn't it established that the Elder Dragons aren't evil (or good)?  They're living forces of nature.  But they are destructive by nature, their very purpose is to consume all magic on Tyria and then go to sleep, releasing that magic back into the world, then they repeat the cycle.  Which kills everything living on Tyria.  Plus they corrupt life by turning living things into their minions, who run around killing everyone else.  Zhaitan and Mordremoth certainly seemed to be outright malevolent in their words and actions (assuming Zhaitan was speaking through his Eyes and Mouths).  I played one of my Sylvari through the HoT story, and there was no "good" coming from Mordremoth's voice in her head.
---
But the fight with Kralkatorrik does present a new idea.  Sure, he was driven mad with the pain and turmoil from the conflicting magic within him, but he still did awful things prior to consuming the magic of Zhaitan, Mordy, and Balth.  And yet he at least seemed to regret killing his daughter.  So maybe the Elder Dragons are slaves to their own nature.  Regardless of what they want or how they feel about it, they are compelled to continue their cycle by some driving, primal force greater than they are.  Perhaps "mother."
---
Did I miss it or was there dialogue with Canach? He wasn't in the epilogue :/
---
&gt; Kralkatorric died on an island in unending ocean, yes we destroyed kralk's torment, but did aurene absorb that torment and kralk overal or will the rest of magic go to steve
---
The most interesting part right there.
---
Play PvP or WvW.
---
Improve yourself, not your character.
---
They don't need a reason for them to be absent. They need a reason for them to be present. I'll take the Spearmarshall, a follower of Balthazar and a coursair captain over two civilians in Divinity's Reach any day of the week.
---
I hope they continue to focus on the characters most important to the story being told rather than bringing back the same hangers-on who have no ability to expand the story beyond themselves.
---
I don't remember specific locations but they were all quite easy to find. They all have hints and are all around the green zone.
---
Now I know the whole Gods == Elder Dragons connection is a bit of dead horse by now, but I couldn't help but notice a callback to it this patch.
---
The warring magics in Kralkatorrik are Mordremoth (plant/mind based), Balthazar (Balthazar) and Zhaitan (death). The God realms we fly through and nab islands for the map from are Melandru's, Balthazar's and Grenth's. It seems like a point being made - and if not, I appreciate the thematic tie-in.
---
it's too bad aurene was xeno'jiiva all along, I still need to get some gamma armor off her
---
Meta event is a combination of Dragon's Stand and Auric Basin in some ways.  I found it very enjoyable-- people just need to learn it.  The loot is worth it-- I came away with over 35 rare gears, and the Gift of Aurene Chest!  I think it'll be a great farm if they don't nerf it to the ground.
---
&gt; So, what would be better in my opinion?
---
I don't think that both of the scenario you described would really have worked for the following reasons.
---
Without Aurene, there was absolutely no reason to fight Kralkatorrik in the first place. We can't kill him because it would destroy Tyria and probably lose a lot of Soldiers because of a very low morale. They would basically force themselves to not fight with everything they got because the alternative would be total destruction either way.
---
Which means that Aurene swooping in to save the day would already be pointless because there is no reason to continue fighting in the first place unless some deus ex machina plot device would be used that "OHMAGAWD we can do XYZ" but in the end turns out to not work at all.
---
A different way in which they could solve the issue would be the domain of the lost. I mean, we already went there and Aurene died a pretty traumatic death. We could remember our time there and try to get there. This would also explain Jokos power better to traverse the realm since we found him there in PoF instead of just resurrection. The problem with this is that the time just isn't there for it in a single episode and many things would feel rushed in a situation or context in which it shouldn't be.
---
So IMO the "solution" was not really that far fetched but something you couldn't prevent either.
---
If your only solution dies then you either have to bring her back or deal with the consequences and while I would have wanted to lose drastically like we thought in Episode 5 it isn't really a good starting point to build upon it. Everything after this would feel like a deus ex machina created just for the purpose of solving the issue and invalidate pretty much everything we did until this point. Why would we go through the trouble for Aurene if we have device XYZ which is less likely to "rebel" or betray us.
---
&gt; My concerns are because I care for the story.
---
You will never have a perfect story! There will always be plot holes and things that will be weird or don't fit together. For me, it made sense and didn't hinder the story and alternatives could have been much worse. We also shouldn't forget the format of the episode and that too much stuff happening in a single episode will make you feel rushing or getting pushed through the episodes.
---
I was waiting for someone to post a SS of this. Thanks! Really interesting.
---
And then have those same people bitching because there's no content? Because that's exactly what happens. Seen it before, will see it again in the future. There is no 'win' for the developers in this regard.
---
Want to play a game at your own pace? That's what single-player games are for. Every MMO in existence uses timegating. GW2 is no exception.
---
Sad :'(
---
it won't keep the map alive. i finished the first collection shortly after reset, already did a meta run today on the map, and now i have nothing to do on the map until reset because of this stupid time and spirit shard gate. these timegates do not keep the map alive longer, they just spread the same amount of activity over more days for no real reason. this gets emphasized by the fact that so far the collections had nothing to do with any events on the map, meaning that the artificially stretched out activity doesn't even benefit the collective meta progress.
---
yeah I know. Just one achievement that you get there and thats all. I just wanted to say that there is a dialog about those two having "fun". Well Taimi does but Sayida sounds tired. Like she would be taking care of a child. Those calling spots are random so dont know how many people would hear this one.
---
It was obvious since the Olmakhan were introduced. An elder dies, needs a replacement, suddenly Rox is getting along with them. Couldn't have been more obvious about it.
---
I doubt it but god I hope so.
---
The Gift of Aurene allows you to select one of the Scion Weapons!  They are fully stat selectable and pretty cute honestly
---
Actual Melandru relevance in-game but still no Melandru outfit. :(
---
I really hope we will see her again one day, I want to see her up close with all the details.
---
Maybe death's bony fingers are covering the words 'apple flavoured'?
---
Thanks for all this work. After I wash the distaste over the end story and the setup for this collection out of my mouth (prob not playing the rest of the week I'm so annoyed) if I decide to do it just to have the mount this will make it easier.
---
No new stats that I could see.  I got one of the Gift of Aurene chests, and it gives you a choice of Scion Weapon.  It's a drop from the meta chests on success I think.  Stat selectable, but no 'new' stat.  Does have all, though-- including Diviner :)
---
Its not like you have to do it in one day, you can split it to the whole week or two,  its fun to do anyway
---
&gt; If the content is fun and rewarding people will run it forever with little complaint.
---
I agree but rewarding for HoT meta events are something totally different than a collection you have to do once on the account.
---
I didn’t. mind that she was revived early. In fact, I loved the entire episode! My only complaint was that it felt a bit short. 
---
It was a nice, feel-good wrap-up after a season of self-doubt, sacrifice, and agony.
---
I did play the Order of Whispers storyline, but it happened 6 or 7 years ago and couldn't remember his appearance, tbh I thought this post was about a more recent character (and not being sure about it I purposefully left a clausle).  
---
I acknowledge that I could've doublechecked though, sorry about that.
---
There's a fine line between a time-gated collection that doesn't feel like it's time-gated because it intrinsically takes a while as there's a lot to do, and a time-gated collection that feels like it's time-gated because the game literally tells you "no, you gotta wait now, come back later".
---
Example: the collections to get elite specialization weapons. I didn't mind doing them. Sure, some were bothersome here and there. But I was partaking in a lot of things and events as I did so, all over Elona. So in the end, it was okay. Now look at this collection, where most of the time you just go to a location and press F, until the game tells you you've done enough for today and should come back later. This is completely different both in design and the way it feels doing it. That's what's pointed at and what is fundamentally bad.
---
So, what they really are saying is that even though they wouldn't mind doing the collection, the way it was designed is a deterrent. And as such, since they only wanted to do this, they're left with nothing else to do. There's nothing more to it.
---
They could forshadow Aurene's return, to avoid the deus ex machina. Maybe she could send a vision from the mists, to give the characters hope to move one, prepare us for the possibility of her return, and make us work on her return, instead of just pulling the crystals off.
---
Scrapper :)
---
Let's say someone could play 10 hours on Saturday but doesn't have time the rest of the week. Now instead of being able to do the collections in one go they can only do one and then nothing until the next Saturday because of the timegate. That means doing 4 collections (I don't know how many there are for skyscale but I think it's at least 3) would take a full month instead of one day.
---
See the problem? People who can play every day don't suffer so much cause they can just hop in the next day, making it just a slight inconvenience. However people who can only only play once a week or so are screwed. Why punish those who already have limited time to play?
---
Honestly, it works. Normally I'd be logging in for a few hours, doing the living world release, getting bored and logging out despite having a few goals like my next legendary or Fractal God. This kept me playing all day long yesterday, and will continue to keep me engaged and looking for other things to do while I wait. I know it sucks not being able to get it the first day, but in the scheme of things it's really not a big deal. It's 5 days; and once guides are out you'll be able to complete each collection in a matter of a couple hours. It's essentially impossible to design an MMO with content that will keep people engaged without resorting to grind or time gating.
---
Clustering wishes will become a new shining star! Become the path its light shines upon! Synchro Summon! Soar, Stardust Dragon!
---
You could already have everything ready before the patch. As soon as the patch was up you only need to buy the Recipe and start crafting 3 precursors, 1 gift and then the legendary.
---
As I just wrote to another reply, I simply couldn't remember Tybalt's appearance and I thought this was about another, newer, character.  
---
I should've checked knowing the possibility, sorry for that.
---
There's a time-gate? I've only just started on the medicines after finding the scales.
---
There were so many gorgeous scenes!  I was actually so wrapped up in what I was seeing that I forgot to take more screenshots.  But I also managed to get a new desktop background: [https://imgur.com/wdT6kxJ](https://imgur.com/wdT6kxJ)
---
Unacceptable ... really? Grow up, geez, im pretty sure youll survive without the skyscale in other zones for a few days, while I can agree that its annoying, its not unacceptable by any stretch, it might've been if it took 30+ days,  but its not even a fucking week
---
feelsbad anet doesnt deliver enough good legendaries to spend them on, and doing mat promotion to spend 25k spirit shards... no ty
---
Yeah I figured that after since there was no mention of a new stat, but good to know it's a meta reward.
---
Crazy stuff :’D
---
There is not timegated components for LS legendary weapons. With enough money and other currency it wont take even a hour to build.
---
At least we got a comment about it later in the story. But yeah it was pathetic. Not even naming us the king in the north after we come back!
---
You don't "need" ascended but new players need the buffer because they don't have the mechanical skills of the fight down or a group who is going to take them without ascended.
---
I stumbled into the comms cloud by pure accident, and because I was actually enjoying the writing so far, I decided to give it a whirl.
---
I was not disappointed.
---
You know what *did* disappoint me?
---
I couldn't hear it again.
---
I didn't try to get Skyscale yet so I didn't know about the delays, but the map seemed fun so far. The lack of exp is not a problem for me, but I can understand that Spirit Shards can be a problem for people who haven't prepped well for Exordium.
---
From what I've heard it's 3 day time gate which is reasonable. Anything more than that is unnecessary and everything below that is too easy/quick for a mount.
---
u/Garg_and_Moonslicer was a hero, I could always see it.
---
The wall cling is really going to take some getting used to.  There were so many times where I stuck to something I didn't want to, especially tree branches I couldn't see because of all the leaves obstructing the view of my character.
---
A good boy taken too soon
---
I am disappointed about that too, but I will give them some time. maybe we will get e blogpost or they say something on the stream on friday.
---
That's the thing, the time gate prevents them from playing the game when they actually do have the time. What's the difference between playing 2 hours during 5 days and 10 hours during one day? Nothing, except the one who has those 5 days will be potentially able to complete the collections in 5 days while the other will have to wait for a month because of artificial restrictions.
---
If you are looking for Diviners, lot of "old stuff" have it on selections. Like Ls3 meta achis, pvp/WvW trinkets. So no need to necessarily farm branded mass.
---
Setting it up was the whole point of bringing back Joko. How is this an arsepull? It got truly chekoved.
---
Indeed, at least that.  But i hope they listen to feedback on this.  Most likely nothing will change, but at least for future updates let us choose how to progress. A good system would be  to have a paywall in gold or gems  to unlock the mount imediatly after the first set of collection, as you progress over the time gated collections that wall gets lower and lower until you can get it for free 5 days later.  I would mind that less than  taking away choices from players for no good reason at all
---
Good ol' condi reaper
---
Well his mind was already described as a raging hurricane at the time. So I would say his calm, resigned voice is what changed since then.
---
IIRC they said that they will look into the PoF metas as well but with no indication on how much they already have "looked into" them. So they could just have acknowledged that there are issues but have not started any form of development yet which could take a while with designing and actual implementation.
---
And those things could happen at any time without any form of actual release.
---
The fact that it's implied that Kralk loved her as a granddaughter and regret what he did to her destroyed me.
---
its 5
---
It still can be a giant gold sink, there is simply no way to know now, and whenever the community gets to give feedback to it , it will be too late anyway and it will be unlikely to change.
---
Me: What do we do now?
---
Noone:
---
Until they have something to show for it though, acknowledging it feels like they're just trying to conveniently sweep it under the rug.
---
Yeah I was really sad with the lack of Canach. :(
---
Yeah, what the heck *are* the shadows anyway?
---
That's a bit too annoying.
---
it requires access to all of the LS:4 maps
---
Exactly, GOT's terrible writing this season has put me in a foul mood for a couple weeks now. But after playing this episode, I was actually feeling quite happy and entertained. We got a decent boss battle with Kralkatorrik and plus a proper farewell ending for Aurene. There is no subverted expectations for the sake of subversion. And also hearing Aurene's voice for the first time is a pleasant surprise. Overall, this episode is just beautiful.
---
Has anyone figured out how to do the "Glossophobia"?: Teach the class at Vehtendi Academy in the Domain of Vabbi.
---
So *that's* what it reminded me of.
---
Somebody in my guild last night said they thought GW1 had no charm. Lol OK, then why is it so much of what's good in GW2..
---
I can't get super up in arms about time-gating as a concept (especially a short time gate) but this feels like its lazily implemented.  "This achievement will unlock tomorrow" is kind of bland.  I guess on the other hand it's very up front about the time gate so it's honest.
---
Previous maps are still alive. I was involved in the Kourna's meta last few weeks and it never failed. There was always a commander to yell "Come here!", "Help to complete that!", sharing advices too. Same in Jahai. A map were there is less than one thousand people doesn't mean it's a deserted map. It just means there's less people.
---
Claiming that timegates keep maps alive is wrong. Let's take an extreme exemple together. Imagine that I've got the griffon already. Imagine that I don't really need the Skyscale. Imagine that I begin the collection and I discover an unbreakable wall: "this timegate". Imagine that I'm very unlucky and I reach this gate just ten minutes after the daily reset (just like some fellows here on Reddit). So I'm unable to begin next part before 23 hours ... It's sad, in 23 hours I can't play, for reasons. Imagine that I don't forget to come back and finally begin the part two 47 hours after. But this part take me too much time to complete and, unlucky again, I need to wait because the reset time came too soon...   
---
I will finally drop this content because it's frustrating and annoying. I will do something else, somewhere else. In the game or **not** in the game. And frustrated as I am now, I really don't know when I'll come back and if I'll come back. Like I said, imagine an extreme exemple. A 5 hour quest completed in a rush or 1 hour a day is still 5 hours of playing, or being connected. Somebody who comes in game just for this will not do anything else just because he/she has to wait. He/She will log out and that's it. Timegates don't allow the game to be more populated. Timegates are just used when there's no other ideas or there's a lack of time to design something fun. 
---
Even when it's hidden with "lore excuse" it's still a lazy design. Just look at some other games where timegates are intentional and kind of logical. Let's choose randomly "Farming Simulator". It's normal that your tomatoes can't grow up in 1 minute. You have to wait the good season, the good weather, etc... Or in another simulator (a life simulator) where 1 minute in game = 1 minute irl. Even in these simulation where developers try to be as colse as possible as reality, you, the player, got the choice to skip some seasons/part of the day/accelerate time/etc. You are free to play like you want to play. 
---
We are in a fantasy world where you can do what you want to do. You can even be a [road sign](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a1q90q/found_this_guy_called_traffic_cones_whilst_on_a/). So no, even hidden behind the best excuse, timegates are lazy designs.
---
You want living maps in long term ? Make a good design. You want players come back in these maps ? Find ideas to make them come back. Don't lock the players.
---
Wait, spirit shards? Already finished both day 1 and day 2 collections, waiting for tomorrow, I dont recall any spirit shards :o
---
Awesome map wich awesome meta event wich gives you a loot of loot , magic and gold ? Now also dropping asc items ? Oh well .. guess this map will never die xD
---
5 days to get it in total apparently
---
You don't need the buffer either, requiring/telling you need full ascended to raid is misleading and huge step to put in front of someone wanting to try out raids. For some gears it will be just as expensive/painful to do either but for berserker having Asscended weapons and as much as you can in trinket (only exo armor) if more than enough to start raiding.
---
You're gonna join training groups with people of the same level/knowledge so it's not an issue at all. I lead very frequently training groups of various level of experience and not having full ascended gear is far down on my list of "why did we fail and what can we do to fix this?".
---
Until a few months ago, I didn't have all the masteries for core, for HoT, and PoF. I've spent about 75% of playtime *without* spirit shard gain beyond dailies (which I didn't always do) because I was lazy as fuck and didn't want to get those last few cheevos for masteries. Now, maybe I'm just a shitter, but what on earth are you doing that requires such a constant supply of spirit shards?
---
Don't get me wrong, I think the time gating is obnoxious. I think the enormous collections are *more obnoxious*. But I'm still just kinda surprised that it's the spirit shards and EXP waste that seem to be the major complaint of your guild.
---
They are part of Menzies army, who was fighting Balthazars Eternals in the Fissure of Woe.

---
&gt; He then gets a vision from aurene, a faint glimpse of her being alive and decides to go back to her... something like that.
---
Could have been a message from kralkatorrik himself, could have worked seeing how it ended.
---
I mean, if they don't want to do it, they shouldn't do it. It's as simple as that, but nobody else cares that they're so devastated. 
---
If it's literally the only thing in the game for them, then they're gonna leave as soon as it's over anyway, so neither ANet, nor anyone else in the player base, should value their take on the subject in any way, since they're not a meaningful voice on the issue.
---
The Astral weapon system is also very time-gated, but nobody (at least nobody I remember) came here wailing about how that one thing that doesn't exist before that episode was the *only* thing they wanted to do in the game, and because they couldn't rush it through all at once, everything was ruined.
---
Even when I went through that collection for a weapon, it was much more a matter of, "Hey, do the next step of that along with your dailies."
---
Idk maybe I'm too casual to understand their issue, but it really does seem like a case of, "This isn't implemented in exactly the way I want, and I can't get everything I wasn't exactly in the way I want it, so everything is ruined completely forever!"
---
Either ya dislike it but are gonna deal with it...in which case, by all means complain but lay off the dramatics...
---
Or it really is the end of the world for you and you're done playing till LS5E1 can ruin your life on its first day...in which case, by all means quit, but spare the rest of us the sermon. We don't care.
---
Not looking forward to the inevitable infusion.
---
Aside from games that don't actually require alts because one character can learn everything (e.g. The Secret World), this game is as alt-friendly as it gets.
---
I can roll a new character, use level scrolls and/or XP tomes to get them to 80, use WvW currency to unlock their elite specs, pull ascended gear from another character, and be ready to go in a matter of minutes with a fresh character at full mechanical power.  All mounts and masteries are account-wide.
---
The only thing I'm really missing are map waypoints, but even that isn't so bad with all the travel items, mounts, and the new rechargeable "teleport to friend" if you're so inclined.  It even has shared inventory slots, all the various keys have been converted into account-wide currencies.
---
IMO, this game has only gotten more and more alt-friendly since launch, and it absolutely is something that keeps me coming back.
---
Cool, thanks. I didn't play the original, so there're some... fissures in my knowledge.
---
There is a huge influx of ectos because of the meta (and map generally) dropping high amount of rare unidentified gear. Ecto prices are decreasing.
---
The griffin felt like a chore and I didn't unlock it until some time before the last LWS episode. I almost regret spending the gold because I rarely use it. But at least now I don't have that hanging over my head.
---
I'm probably going to unlock the skyscale too, but boy golly is it going to take awhile.
---
&gt;using base insults just proves how immature you are as an individual. 
---
&gt;I pity you, I truly do.
---
Were you born like this or did it happen after the accident?
---
Just out of curiosity, what is the name of the amulet in English?
---
Well I assume you still might loot asc armor and weapons, but I didn't know about trinkets :o
---
If that's the justification you'd think they could at least give some in-game flavor to the thing.  This is purely, in big bold letters, a game mechanic.  The time investment is whatever, I rarely rush to finish that sort of thing early anyways, but this just feels so... inelegant.
---
Goren's Eel-Tooth Charm 
---
Got him on my revenant ;)
---
it has the same rules as sigils and traits involving kills - namely, if it doesn't give you exp, it doesn't count. which includes most event spawned mobs from the new map.
---
just go to orr
---
I said it before, in a season where they wanted to write the most important death in the story, they sure did make death feel cheap.
---
They had an immortal Lich who cheated death constantly, they killed the Commander and brought them back a single story step later (with no clear reason why it was possible or earned, it just kinda happens because we want it to happen), they bring back the ghosts of dead people so they can have their final moments with loved ones (cheating death of another consequence - the inability to speak to the dead again or accomplish life's goals like Eir helping kill Kralkatorrik) and the character they killed in the penultimate episode was impossibly to kill for plot reasons, so they had to bring her back (and we never believed it in the first place).
---
It's absolutely awful the way they totally cheapened death in Tyria since PoF came out and the worst part is they got nothing out of it. Killing the commander was important why? Killing Aurene accomplished what? It was all messy and pointless or just for shock value and the story suffers because of it.
---
I agree it was set up but I also agree with the above that it is kind of cliche. Like no one from the gang thought about something with Joko could save Aurene?
---
About the same for me, over 6h
---
Low hanging fruit with full cheese topping is such a great way to describe GW2 storytelling and dialogue.

Sure x)

Oh no, I hope he doesnt go back to his old hairstyle. Bald Braham is best Braham.
---
&gt;Directly teleports the player to a party or squad member anywhere in a non-instanced PvE environment. 
---
I don't think they'd work in instanced PvE (e.g. fractal or raid) *at all*, regardless of being in the same instance.  But open world PvE?  Sure, no problem, even if you're on the other side of the world.
---
Hey, This is a [science-based dragon MMO](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/) after all...
---
Working on this thing was already souring my mood but this just takes the cake. The time 
---
gating doesn't even make sense when part of their lore is that they just kinda popped into existence fully grown.
---
Just calm down people. Yes, waiting 5 days to get the mount sucks, but this is not food, water or shelter. It's a video game.
---
Discussion about whether timegating should be used in content like this or not is another matter, but shouting fuck-yous in all caps isn't going to change the situation. It may or may not be tweaked in the future, but everyone playing right now has to wait out the timegate for sure.
---
But couldn’t she talked when she absorbed Balthazar’s magic?
---
What if Kralk was, in the lifetime of Dragons, only a teenager?  
---
What are we going to do if "Mother" shows up? :)
---
I feel that PoF makes a big point about how Vlast and Aurene are different, and how a nurturing, loving relationship with a mortal was the leading cause for this.
---
I'm okay with it taking time, if it's a fun experience. I love Scavenger hunts, but only when the hints are good.
---
"On a limb, near water" is not a good hint for christ's sake. I've spent an hour and half flying around and have found 3 scales.
---
Not I'm not using Dulfy, because I actually like to play the game.
---
Yeah I love gvg.
---
*sob*
---
I'd say Scrapper. It's in a weird limbo where it's just a nuisance in PvP
---
Mirage is far superior for solo openworld roaming in my opinion. Works good on power builds but shines with condi. If you can afford, gear an ascended trailblazer (pahua's) set (cost is not much different than exotic so don't go exotic if you decide on that) and you can solo almost every boss other than legendary creatures.
---
The only problem is that relies on the news spreading faster then say... the airships leaving dragonfall and going to LA. Likely there wouldn't be an celebration until after the airships docked and people started talking.
---
Like how the commander was wandering LA when Caithe contacted him/her, asking them to return to Thunderhead.
---
Zhaitan's post-defeat gathering was at Fort Trinity, the at the time (maybe still is?) Pact headquarters and main launching point of the offensives into Orr. Also IIRC, it's implied that the big party happened after the entire fleet had returned and docked :P.
---
Asking the real questions here, also its 96, each essence gives 2 % bonus
---
Well Shadows are here still... So... Maybe something with that?
---
no gold required. but heavily time-gated.
---
Few numbers; from map reset to another, I got 43 rare unids and about 70 map currencies, whilst another player told me he got 38 rare unids and 80 map currencies. Don't remember how long the whole cycle took.
---
Thanks. I've read on the forums that the last collection takes 4 days. Is it true? There are more resets along the way?
---
I was thinking, that new classes could be like having many ways of the same. 
---
Let's say new player don't have PoF but somehow he can play new content. Then, he must be able to access all places the other way, with maybe a faster or slower way in some places, depending on your class. 
---
Let's say that there is a zone that is under heavy fire. Warriors mount can use shielding and carry others. Optionally there will be a temporary portal that can be powered by a mesmee, engineer can travel alone in golem and ranger riding a best can use alternative route filled with traps, and he will be immune.
---
Optionally PoF players can use mounts.
---
Thinking of this now, this will make new elite class kinda mandatory in such content so my second iteration of this idea could be - class locked masteries.
---
Few tiers could be enough.
---
Do you remember special class interactions during ls3? Like necro taking over skeletal minions? Also in some places we have like a thief opening a door skipping an event in raid.
---
Maybe something like this?
---
Check the date on your story steps. Maguuma was like four years ago. They built new airships.
---
Chrono would be the best recommendation imo. The second best probably a quickbrand.
---
Signet ranger pressing longbow 4 on the cooldown
---
My laptop already shows it's age, but the meta and fiery part of the map absolutely destroys my FPS. First time hitting below 20 FPS in a meta, I usually hover around 30 in other world bosses/meta events with lots of players and 50-60 by myself.
---
This is why I dont really play this game anymore. I stay on the sub, i play when my wife does sometimes,  but its incredibly frustrating having to spend hours and hours to get a single mount, and wait time.  
---
Its usually so long I dont want to do it because its too many little things to keep track of.
---
its actually 100%
---
The Norn male body options are so limited.
---
How many timegates are there? Does it actually take 6 days to complete?
---
I can't remember if it's stat select but there's a backpack from Kourna that you can buy from a heart vendor. It's a little tank with a grub looking thing in it from the heart west of the Allied Encampment.
---
No you don't but the whole map is much easier to navigate with the mount, specially with all the masteries. Again there will be no point in doing so when you get it though.
---
When I see things like this I hope two things:
---
* arenanet is going to develop GW3 (or is already doing so)
---
* they never do something like this again
---
Really, hiding stuff behind tedious collections already annoys me as hell, making the collections unecessarily long adds to my annoyment. Yeah, I know, I know, you gotta keep the people playing, but there just have to be better ways than this.
---
Also this doesn't even factor in, that you also need masteries to fully use the mount, for which you have to do even more stuff. That said, this is most definitely a first world problem. I really wish game design elements like this would not (need to) exist.
---
Well said. And that's what people often forget. And that's why it's important to let people play as they want to play with the mechanics you create. Developers imagine mechanics and level designs. Players enjoy them just like they want to.
---
Abandon doesn't own the word 'torment', I think it was just genuine pain Kralkatorrik was feeling. Plus Abaddon would be a small fry compared to Kralkatorrik.
---
I was getting murdered by oakheart lookin dudes and couldn't hear it properly, hope someone records it.
---
Praised them for what exactly? Like everything in this game is timegated already. From dungeon rewards, raid resets, crafting, world events. It's been a problem since day 1
---
Hey - at least we don't have to find something on the TP that someone bought the entire supply of and plans on slowly bleeding it back to the playerbase at 10,000x the price.
---
I dont even think I hit max level but I played a hamster with 2 pistols and it was pretty smooth combat.
---
And what's the problem with it taking a full month? How does it matter? It just means it's a prestigious reward that takes time and investment. They can't play the game as much, then it takes more time for them. Period.
---
The devs can't, and shouldn't create everything with what you're saying in mind. A game is meant to be played, if you can't play, you don't progress.
---
thanks for the reply
---
Well, consider it a resilience factor. If your nature is to consume magic, and you are a powerful, intelligent being who has to answer to nobody and know no equal, then you may be more inclined to give in to your nature. If your nature is to consume magic, and you have experienced the forming of bonds with other sentient beings, and experienced empathy, and love, and sacrifice, then you may be able or perhaps even compelled to consider the consequences of your actions.
---
Kralkatorrik answers to nobody. Aurene loves people, and has an understanding of how beautiful and precious life is. There is empathy in play, which would help Aurene to resist her nature as a devourer of magic. Where Kralkatorrik may feel that there is no negative consequence of giving in to his hunger, Aurene has reasons not to. 
---
I imagine that Aurene is not necessarily a more biologically nor magically more powerful kind of dragon than Kralkatorrik, she is just a different person, with a different perspective on life and who would continue the cycle in another manner.
---
Which, to be honest, would be just what Glint would want, no? Not necessarily to rid the world of Kralkattorik the Elder Dragon, but rather to rid the world of Kralkttorik.
---
The story was 100% better when they had source material.
---
That is interesting. I say that because someone posted a thread in which the walls in WvW weren't rendered for him and he could walk through the walls without any problems.
---
What I got from this was that the rendering and the actual collision detection was not validated by the server but rather by the client: Not rendered would then also mean no collision.
---
In your case the position could let the client know that you are now swimming and therefore have to animated the character in that way.
---
Sand shark ?
---
5 days. 6 if you missed the first reset like many did.
---
Also pretty sure I saw a roller beetle destructible wall somewhere
---
Engineer or thief overall?
---
I like to fast burst everyone with nice skills and good weapons and fun in your opinion. A class that feels light but does many things and viable specs.
---
Are scenes from the original PS really considered spoilers almost 6 years later? You wouldn't consider posting scenes from films released 6 years ago a spoiler, so why should this be?
---
Thanks, I don't really want to craft a whole new set of gear just to play the story content then go back into hibernation but I was just worried Chrono was gonna be too rough to even be enjoyable (I've played some downright depressing solo builds that make the solo battles more annoying than it's worth)
---
Right now my chrono has full ascended zerker gear, with two pow/pre/tough/concentration accessories and power/healpow/concen. pants. Is that fine for trying out the [Mirage build here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Axe/x_Infinite_Horizon)? I'd have to buy an exotic axe, pistol and torch
---
it gets addictiv after like the 5th or 6th legy and of course, a good ingame income is realy helpful.
---
If Aurene didn’t come back early in the episode then we would have a really different series of events play out. No chasing Kralk through the mists and blasting him out of the sky. No map made up of mist chunks pinning him down into the ocean. I don’t know how you make that happen without Aurene present. 
---
Personally, I think that ANet intended this lengthy gap between episodes to serve as the time for players to grieve and feel like all hope was lost (in a bit of a fourth wall breaking style). The problem of course is that I don’t actually think a lot of players actively care about the story outside of instances so even though time has passed in-story and in real-life, a lot of people don’t acknowledge it. 
---
Personally for me I was pretty happy with how things turned out and how the characters in-story responded, and ANet didn’t break any of their rules to put things in motion. I get that a pretty vocal portion of players think it’s a lot of BS. I just don’t agree. It’s not winning a Pulitzer, but I think that the writing for this episode did what it needed to do and was carried by individual moments of greatness.
---
&gt; if you can't play, you don't progress.
---
I literally cannot progress right now because I missed the reset.
---
&gt; Did the fallout 76 crowd design this ?  There is no reason for this silly  time gate for a mount. There is plenty to do on the new map, the design is great, the mechanics are great, they actually managed to put nearly everything the game has to offer and more in one map, the meta is also great and the whole thing looks amazing.  But why do this ? Really. It's like getting your dream car, but without the  seats.    
---
Yeah, I was actually digging the map and looking to explore more and try metas after the story to fill up my new mount bar. 
---
Then the collection hit and I noped out and logged out. Soured me on the whole thing. 
---
 
---
&gt; The biggest issue with all of this, is that they decided to hide from us instead of making it clear that at best the mount would be actually unlocked to play  5 days from the release.  At least be honest with us  so we don't create false expectations like having the mount unlock during the story in a meaningful way.
---
Honestly, it should have unlocked from the story, and the collection could be for a skill upgrade or even just extra mastery points to make finishing it off easier for those that have not hit every mastery point.
---
WITNESS ALL OF MY COSMETIC AURAS!

Fair points!

So instead of me being able to complete a collection when I want to complete a collection I have to wait until the devs tell me I should complete the collection?
---
Drawing it out does N O T H I N G.

So many keys bought...

Hey man I just wanted to say I'm a big fan of your work in the "STFU grimjack" video clip. Always brings me joy to watch
---
Can we get more cinematics with our main character though \\o/ I felt like the chosen one!
---
We got too many deaths already through the story.
---
It was time to get a win.
---
The dragons were never evil. They were forces of nature. They balance the world, but through extremes. Glint and the forgotten just sought to change this for a more balanced approach, but daddy Kralky wasn't having that rebellious teenager talk of change.
---
Give me one example where timegating improved the gameplay or feature. In any game. 
---
There are other ways to gate stuff. Make stuff difficult, make it a grind, etc. It allows you to progress at your own pace and you still won't be able to complete it in a short while. Timegating is the worst way to gate progression ingame because it removes choice and control from the player.
---
Learned this lesson the hard way when I was a teenager playing GW1 through High School. It's still online, but the amount of people left...
---
In all fairness, it's not a surprise to the characters per se. They always understood channeling the magic into aurene was going to be the play.
---
I have plenty of that left - just finished LWS2 today :) But it’s good to have stuff to look forward to. Still tons upon tons of collections/achievements/etc to do, and I am looking forward to it, but it does feel a little bit hollow if there will be no new content to use all of this on later. 
---
Again, that is waaaaays ahead. I am just worried that a neat end might indicate that there are no updates planned
---
Why would you do that for a computer game...?
---
I had a discussion in this sub with a guy who said that the writing was garbage this episode, but his alternative was to have Caithe somehow channel Kralkatorrik’s magic through a Taimi Device into a powerful being like the Gods or the Pale Tree. I mean wtf, people just like to complain.
---
I think it is implied Aurene is sort of an evolved Dragon. Kralk calls her the first of her kind when his evil corruption calls her a traitor to her kind. I think the clue was in the crystals. Kralks where a set color/Mineral while Aurenes closer and closer rsembled a clear crystal/prism. My guess is a clue that she is able to absorb process and direct  a more varied type of Light/Magic just like a prism  can absorb all spectrums of light and  separate it with ease.
---
Her transformation had a prism look to it. an aurora Dragon of sorts.
---
&gt; This will keep the map alive for a long time, plus you have time to do events and meta in here that are really good, for new armor, curriencies, nodes etc.
---
Or it will do what it did to me with Draconis Mons and turn a map that I really liked into one that utterly hate and never want to see again. Time gating drags things on by just inserting a bunch of wait times while creating so much extra frustration for people who are unlucky and were accidentally just a little late on turning it in before reset. Because of that it ends up making me want to rush through all of the dialogue and interactions that the writers and voice actors put effort into (which since it's and achievement collection line I'll probably never even get the chance to hear again) just to not be stuck behind a longer wait timer. 
---
And if the point is to keep the map alive for longer, then it does a really poor job at that. When I finished my fist day Skyscale collection I just stopped playing. I'm not going to keep playing the map for the duration and go for the other stuff just because I don't want to burn myself out on something that I already know is going to be a drug out for a multiple day collection. But likewise because of that, I don't get to really play at my own pace and will probably get tired of the map before I get hooked into going for the skins that I would have started on pursing normally (of which those skins can actually be pursued for a longer span of time with more consistent participation in the meta events focus). So it either kills a map faster or at best it only really gives an extra 5 days added to player retention. :/

Anet posted a roadmap some time ago. They announced a new raid wing an and season 6 after season 5 if I remember correctly. So I hope you don’t need to worry about future content yet.
---
Have fun playing and achieving!
---
Leave it to the Gw2 reddit to literally defend timegating lol. Man I miss the simple days when it was just lord krall white knighting the lore before the community got filled with low iq brainlets
---
One of the very few times I've cried at a video game.
---
You laid it bare, exactly what the issue is. You're willing to work for this, but you only have set times you can.
---
And **still** people come at you with the "well if you aren't willing to work, you don't deserve it" bullshit. Reading comprehension is hard, y'all.
---
What about Zojja? We saw her only at the end of HoT story.
---
Not much different from time gates where you have to buy something once a day.
---
Yeah, that's why you don't stretch out collections and have repeatable, rewarding content in other places. You don't *need* to time gate the skyscale because ideally, people will be coming back to play the new map meta.
---
Would you like some fries with that salt?
---
If you want to use a broadsword skin then sure
---
This but unironically. Now if the content was actually fun and engaging that would be a different story
---
If you didn't post.
---
Nice conclusion. You must be a fun person to hang out with.
---
See also: people unironically defending terrible game design and bad story
---
Disagreement is for good when it leads to an open minded and constructive talking. (-:   
---
That said, the whole drama here is that timegates are not good designs. And I really think it's a fact, not an opinion. But anybody can change my mind.
---
Should have put the /s I guess.  Aren't we shitposting here?
---
the next raid wing should come within a month so there you go
---
Sieran murmering something along the lines of 'I always wanted to know what it's like to be in love' while walking to her death hits me hard.
---
Just watch the gw2 stream once a month and you are done.
---
I don't think it's that. This patch was being worked on before Anet had the layoffs/refocusing, so it was still using the same strategy of having a skeleton crew trying to hide that it was made by a skeleton crew, and the patch itself was probably too far along to really benefit from renewed focus.
---
Good to know, thank you!
---
I don't really get the point of timegating this, if you have massive amount of collection that's fine but not like this
---
At this time of year?
---
Exactly! I think we'll still be dealing with the balance of magic next, but I'd love to have a small band of heroes (Canach, Gorrik, Jory and Kasmeer please) go on a distant expedition in search of the next source in a new area. I'd be okay with another blood stone to be honest.
---
This is canon now.
---
5 hours without a guide. with one maybe 1 hour
---
The meta is a hell of a lot better than any other PoF map so far at least.
---
I had to head to bed after collecting the skyscale scales and a couple of components of the skyscale medicine last night.
---
If I wanted to get through the first timegate before reset today, do I have to complete both the egg collection and this sick skyscale collection? Or just the eggs?

Im moving the game from E: to C:
---
I STRONGLY recommend to bind the "Mount ability 2" button to the same button as "Swim down".  
---
It makes things way more intuitive and comfortable. 
---
I recommend using the Shift key for this, as it also goes well with using Shift for "nitro" in rollerbeetle and swooping down with griffon with your pinky.
---
Shift can also be bound "Lock ground target" at the same time, since you won't need to lock ground targets while in a mount or underwater.
---
They really made it perfect for the skyscale once you get all the masteries. So many of the cliffs are too high for a springer but will probably be traversable with the skyscale cliff jump.
---
That can't be good for their PR when Teapot is one of the last big streamers they got left.
---
Tybalt and Rytlock are two of the only Charr I really care about, and of them Tybalt is the only one I love and consider a friend... The rest are just beasts ^Ascalon ^belongs ^to ^humanity ^#REBUILDTHEWALL
---
The Shatterer was not a natural creature native to Ascalon so clearly there was at least *some* deliberate investment in maintaining the Dragonbrand. 
---
What really throws me off is Kralk's behaviour pre-EoD. If he was not crazy and not evil why would he not *listen* to Glint? What reasons would she in turn have to reject an offer of peaceful collaboration? Sure, no need to care about puny humans but his own daughter?
---
Ok I'll bite. If you insist on realism, then why not have it be a set timer instead of being tied to the bloody daily reset. Yeah eggs totally hatch at 7pm est each night. But regardless no one cares about the eggs having a real hatch time other than like 3 carebears. Nearly everyone views this as items to check off a list. No one is like "oh boy I'm hatching eggs!" 
---
Collections aren't lore. They're just a system to get things
---
Previous LS finales lead straight into an expansion, hence the introduction so they could hit the ground running during the expansion. 
---
With LS5 being the next release they have plenty of time to set the scene in the first episode.
---
but he was just there, he didn't even snark at something
---
Yeah, I started off pretty disappointed by the early part of the chapter, but I think it rebounded nicely as it went on, and the writers did a great job of both giving us a solid conclusion, while also leaving *just* enough hooks to still make me excited to see where they go from here. 
---
The new map is also stellar. 10/10 on that front.
---
They go to the Hertz rental car center
---
&gt; And what did it mean that she has to show everyone something?
---
I think this was a nod to ED's hoarding magic, but her sharing it. "I can't explain it, but I can show it, to all of you." (paraphrasing).
---
That picture makes me think of Ascalon pre-searing, when you see the spiders next to a fountain. In my mind this is how I remember seeing that zone. I wanna say it was regent valley.
---
This is hilarious and should be more visible.
---
I got both Wayfarer's Henge and Mark Y Golem and the timegate for the golem honestly wasn't that bad from what I remember. Wayfarer's Henge was a struggle though, I think with the timegate it takes almost a month to do and so I spent atleast an hour or two in Draconis Mons everyday. That being said both of them were back items and so not really pressing things I needed immediately like a new mount.
---
That's fair
---
When I realized this is a daily thing I kinda felt forced to use a guide. Thanks for putting this up! (though I am going to be a day later than the curve.
---
Oh, I misread your post. I guess I'm still waking up ;)
---
As I said, i think the mechanics felt smooth, but I hated the actual class design.
---
I started with a Warrior, which was fun in open world and boring af in instanced combat at max level. So, I reverted to a ranged class, like I usually play. Spellslinger and Esper just didn't do it for me. Esper was slightly more fun, but had serious issues (especially in open world stuff).
---
Comparing Esper to things like BLM in FFXIV, Elementalist or Mesmer in GW2, or Mage/Warlock in WoW, it's just not even a competition.
---
You might want to consider grabbing them now, they are both on sale - if you just grab the standard versions you can get Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire for $25 (total) right now.
---
They're fantastic for farming BL keys though.  Well worth the 800 gems for this.
---
You sure it can drop or you can only get it from Skrit stashes all over the island ? There is a bit of a diference.
---
Honestly, if they were really dead set on this time gate they could have made it require time gated materials instead that you could normally get once a day for doing something but also that other players could sell on the TP so you could accelerate it by purchasing it off other players if you didn't want to wait. Sort of like the ascended mats.
---
Or at least just have the collections unlock at the same time for everyone (one a day at reset, so even if you didn't do the first before the first reset it still unlocks) so people that miss binging it or can't play days in a row can just blow through it later. It still accomplishes drip feeding it while it's new, but once it's old you can just blow through it.
---
Even if just allowing us to at least use the skyscale on demand like all the other mounts (without having to find a rent a mount spot) on the new map only, once we hit the daily wall. Something. I mean once you finish the first giant collection you've already been to every spot like 3 times at that point.
---
i probably should have clarified further - i can't *afford* them right now. I'd love to get them, especially because of the sale, but I can't. thanks anyway!
---
There was some environmental dialog between them and Taimi in the previous episode IIRC. As much as I love Team Fur Suit and our Snarky Salad they all seem to be fated to going off and doing their own thing so the stage is clear for our power couple to make a return in S5. 
---
Personally I'd love for S5 to be more of a 'cleaning house' season rather than a 'getting the band back together to save the world' season. How many plot threads are there dangling from the personal story? Zojja?
---
It wasn't an ass pull, they set it up plenty, you just didn't like it. Say what you mean.
---
What you're saying essentially is that if you have a cake and you cut the cake into 10 pieces instead of 6 you have more cake. Which is just straight up wrong.
---
If you started a month ago this would not be a spoiler
---
Wow Bloodstone Dust in French is something of a mouthful!
---
It’s not 10 min of their time, Caithe’s story implies commander was missing for quite a while (few days?) after Aurene died.
---
Welcome aboard! FYI, the two expansions are on sale right now for a total of $25. If you think you'll be in for the long haul, now is a good time to pick it up to save some money:

---
You aren't rewarded in any way? What about the items you get? Gold is a bigger reward for most players than spirit shards are.
---
Marjory and Kasmeer not being there for either of the attempts at Kralk... they definitely need a bigger excuse for not being present to actually help us.
---
There is an event where you teach the students. Its not the heart itself, it is an event that you have to wait for.
---
Marjory and Kasmeer haven’t been in a single episode or have had a single line of dialogue in all of season 4
---
&gt; Bit weird that Rox, Marjory, Kasmeer, and Canach are just totally MIA in the final scene though.
---
Personally, I only found it weird that Kasmeer and Marjory were absent, though it would have almost been more jarring if they were there. I think Rox and Canach will find their “home” to be Elona and thus have little reason to return to Lion’s Arch with us.
---
Asura are gross lab mice, but Bliss was a robot so he's cool.  He is now one with the Eternal Alchemy.
---
its just 120GB
---
the email is one thing but you know this post has a spoiler tag right? and when a post is spoiler tagged, reddit automatically covers the image with a filter that has to be manually clicked off
---
I think we need an "End of Dragon's Watch" epilogue.
---
Clear the way for Fate's Razor.
---
It's been like one or two weeks cuz if you take into account Rytlock:Requiem then an assumption would be that... My opinion tho...
---
Doesn't matter, people apparently keep playing games they don't enjoy
---
Ok people have gone off rails with complains About Aurene and the supposed lack of clues for further story.  IM here to say It aint so and we should be discussing  a few throwaway things:
---
\- Aurene being a new type of dragon, figuratively and literally: SHe turned into an elder Crystal dragon, resembling a Prism/Aurora Borealis . Even Kralk called her the first of her kind. My guess Newer Dragons may be able to somehow be evolved and  not barred by single type of magic-else- indigestion That ailed Kralk
---
\-Kralk Calls out for a mother: Elder Dragon Origins or Aurene spawning new replacements for the rest of the Elder Dragons?
---
\- The Realms of the Gods: We got a glimpse of a Realm we havent seen before, Melandru's. We dont have a name SO lets call it the Garden. Also the Return of the Shadow Army. New Enemies to GW2/old foes from GW1 as far as i can tell  they are new models and with no Balthazar, no Eternal Army left( and theres still no knowledge on what happened to Menzies correct?) THe spilling of this Chunk of the FoW may spell a new threat unrelated to the Elder Dragons and maybe even more important than we realize.
---
\-The Title and Tagline of Trailer poem: War Eternal, The Eternals, " The end may just be the end of the Beginning". More clues perhaps to Menzies and the Shadow army?
---
I havent explored the whole map or the mini story of sorts past the  end. ( SKyscale collection serves as a bit of story after so to speak) so there may be even more clues hidden around the map.  Like Gorrik im  researching what revelations these tiny infos bring. We have confirmed the SKyscale isnt from Tyria proper but from the mists, and they feed off magic so basically they ARE dragons, so Dragons ARE  from the mists ( keep in mind the mists are part of Tyria as well. just a separate part).
---
My point is this  Patch brought a LOT to digest to the table and a lot we can be excited about. Wether we think Aurene came back too soon or not. Whether Kralks fight was a cop out or made sense due to scale the fact is a lot of  effort was put into writting and lore not only on the main plot but also possible branches. 
---
Anet has opened up more paths and more questions without closing themselves into a given path YET and THAT is a great thing.
---
IMHO I think this was indeed a great finale overall. I cant wait to see what comes next.
---
If only that April fools Expansion served as inspiration   now as well :)
---
PS: I enjoyed so much that Cinematic of Kralk Falling Into Tyria, I wouldve only added 2 things : A comment of them saying theyd direect him to  a remote place to prevent collateral and  All the pact ships shooting as He fell through the portal to cement that  " bringing him down" scene.
---
&gt; Taco
---
I fixed this up a little for you: https://pastebin.com/w7jVGYHT
---
I set the POIs types as well as added a trigger-range to activate them on F. Set the fade out to not exist since it's a huge map too.
---
Hope this is helpful to other people.
---
Do we know where the Deep Sea Dragon is? According to the wiki, "its exact location remains unknown." The ocean is a very big place... I figured it was somewhere around Cantha, which is way off from south of Orr. So Kralk landed closer to Zhitan's old territory, and recently its own territory, than it would have been to Bubbles. That said, Bubbles may have noticed it even if it didn't show up. We've heard very little about bubbles, its minions, or such but chances are it is way weaker than Kralk since it probably didn't get much of the other dragon's energy while Kralk had some from every dragon but Bubbles.
---
Any reason in particular?
---
I'm leaning towards no availability from John DiMaggio maybe?
---
no problem.
---
lmfao where did he say that? you don't have to "play since launch" to just finish the Whispers storyline lol.
---
they'll be on sale later again, maybe around halloween? maybe december, who knows.
---
Do spacemonger if you want further assistance plz
---
I absolutely plan to be in the long haul but I unfortunately can't afford them right now. But I still plan to stay! And maybe there'll be another sale at a later date when I'm able to grab them
---
I really love the shape of her wings - they're crystalline but they've got that slightly organic curve she inherited from Mordremoth and Zhaitan
---
Shut up you! 
---
Just... sniff... shut up...
---
By the time I realized there was a timegate on it the reset had already happened. I am forced to look at guides though with the griffon and beetle I loved that I could do them on my own time. But I don't want 6 days to turn into 12.
---
 I think he may have been just calling her Mother as in she will be the Mother of a new race of Elder Dragons
---
They were protecting and securing villages around the area . You were suppose to get even call from them but nothing . Dont know if it was % based or something. But dont worry. They might not be next to you but they are helping as best as they can.
---
Anyone else notice that Kralk crashed in the unending ocean?
---
I was expecting some of his magic to get swallowed up by Selbbub, leading into the next LW chapter and heading into Cantha.
---
you think?
---
DPS is much higher, very good selfbuff and nearly undestroyable.
---
So i can carry PuGs
---
Quite right! I haven't even been playing for an entire year and it's still not a spoiler to me.
---
The backpacks can only be gotten 1x per collection though :\
---
Still, it's nice to be able to get the rings+accessories+neck. It costs 1425 Mistborn Motes to do the armor unlocks (no achievement for doing so it seems), so after that I will probably start picking up some spare sets of things like Harrier.
---
We haven’t seen them once all season, they’ve had no appearance or dialogue at all since PoF
---
It’s not widely used but I’m sure it would be viable. Most groups would prefer druid, firebrand, or renegade.
---
Looks like it. 
---
* Previous chapter
---
* Requiems stories happen while the commander leaves 'to think' and to tell the news in LA.
---
* Current chapter.
---
Marvel Captain
---
Tybalt and Sieran made me sad.
---
Forgal made me yell, "FUCK YEAH!" and start doing air guitar.
---
Canach will take all the money he earned since PoF and o-en his own Casino before Zalambur can expand into Central Tyria with the help of the captains council. 
---
Season 5 will focus on the competition between the two and will include a heist, mount chases, political corruption and end up with Canach being framed for the murder of a council member, everyone assuming the former criminal to be guilty, doubly so because it wouldn’t be the first time a Sylvari was implicated in such a crime. The penultimate episode will rehash the Noir detective style with Marjory investigating.
---
probably but then they could've just said he stayed in thunderhead to profit some more of his fighting ring or something rather then have him standing there like a cardboard cutout
---
They want to sell gem skins, which you know they’ll rinse for the skyscale, but they are putting a time-gate on getting the mount!
---
Damn, I hope they're outstanding quality.
---
You don't have to 100% the maps, but the collection requires you to go to a bunch of different maps including all season 4 maps.
---
Y'know what? No. It's old content. *Very* old content. How about you let people take responsibility for themselves and their own actions instead of giving in to your compulsion to play Police Nanny?
---
Previous maps are not alive
---
I also love it how at the &gt;!Epilogue Logan goes something like "We saved the day again!"!&lt;
---
Wishful thinking gets you nowhere dear Logan.
---
Fair Enough! They usually go on sale several times throughout the year anyways so there will be other opportunities. Even at full price $50 for both expansions isn't that hard a pill to swallow (considering the cost of games these days).
---
Welcome to the game! 
---
A few things to note since you’re just starting out:
---
1- Don’t be afraid to ask for help. The community in this game is amazing (at least in NA) and I am able to call on my guildies just to help me with a open-world boss that kicked my butt. 
---
2- F2P does have some limitations. You won’t really feel them until you get to level 80, however there are still plenty of fun endgame activities. PvP, WvW, Dungeons, exploration, and fractals of the mist are available for free to play players from any level- dungeons do have an entry level- (but, especially fractals and WvW, you should probably do it at level 80). You also cannot use map chat, but can talk to your guild, party, or whisper to other players just fine. 
---
3- when you decide to, the base game with both expansions is $50, however, it tends to go on sale every once and a while. The game’s anniversary is in August, so I bet it will go on sale than. 
---
4- join a guild. You can have up to 5 guilds at one time, so don’t worry about choosing the wrong guild. 
---
Seriously though, you can forget everything I just said and be perfectly happy in game. If you are in NA, I wouldn’t mind showing you around the game. Just give me your in game name and we can figure out a time to both be online. 
---
Happy dragon slaying!
---
Try turning off your post processing completely
---
I think that I'm thinking this, but with an episode subtitled "The End", it may be our last new map, so maybe they're wanting to go out with a bang.
---
Ooooh!  Be nice if it was intended. Fatebreaker might be cheaper going forward :)
---
The core game is entirely available  to you as a F2P player.
---
Just a heads up as well, the game's anniversary is at the end of the summer (august) and there are usually pretty decent sales around that time. So if you're able to save some money until then, you'll have a good shot at a discount on the expacs :)
---
 and I do believe that F2P will keep you entertained for a while!
---
Welcome to Tyria!
---
Chrono can carry bad. A healer (heal fb or druid) can carry stupid. You decide what you feel your group needs.
---
Some ppl said that you need to complete ALL of living world 4, is that correct, or you simply need access to the map?
---
More like holy shit a bunch of really stuttery crabs came out of nowhere and wrecked the servers.
---
I'd even say it could go a bit further than that back to S1. S1 indirectly dealt with leylines and S2 with the egg. HOT did have an ending, but it wasn't a great resolution since the impacts of Mordremoth's death weren't answered until S3, which turned out to be very bad.
---
I don't think I would have been satisfied if this was the ending to the game as a whole, but it feels like a nice conclusion to everything we've been building towards since post-core. Also, there were some hints of where the story might go next, but not having a clear teaser kinda makes it more existing.
---
Another crazy idea is that not knowing where we're going next is in itself a teaser for the Deep Sea Dragon since the whole theme of that dragon is a lack of information right down to the name.
---
&gt; There was a whole story chapter devoted to getting an orb specifically to block his passive corruption in an area.
---
Nope, *all* EDs can corrupt the land itself even without physical proximity. The Blue Orb was not about negating any particular threat from Zhaitan's physical body but to keep the corrupting magic associated with all minions at bay.
---
&gt; He did make some minions using corpses but those were the ones used to find and gather his food.
---
Unless you mean **all** Risen this is incorrect. The source of the Mouths is not known in detail but the Ossuary was dedicated to creating Abominations which were used as frontline assault troops in place of shock cavalry.
---
&gt; There’s a huge difference between minions gathering corpses that were about and specifically targeting certain living individuals to be used.
---
The Risen were *already* killing and raising everything they could get their grimy paws on and *did* make use of individuals' unique talents and abilities (Kitah, Ferghen and many others). Zhaitan's army certainly understood the implications of the Blighting Pod approach but their undead-like nature lent itself to a different strategy.
---
What?!?  😂
---
^ Username checks out
---
It's the new vigil swag
---
He just woke up one day, flew from point A to point B, then just went back to bed. He corrupted stuff on his path, seemingly on accident, not out of malice. Kind of like a natural disaster, what elder dragons are supposed to be.
---
yeah, sure i'll pm my name lat- hol'up  
---
*dragon slaying?*
---
They have a limited voicing budget for each episode, and voice actors have their own schedules.
---
If a character doesn't get voices, it may be because of scheduling issues, or because lack of budget for more voices.
---
Well I saw Kroof's video on it and well it looks like a week or two not more cuz I don't think it's ethical for them to leave Aurene in brand crystals like that...
---
yes, if they ended the kralk arc last episode it would have been more climactic
---
IT'S PIKACHUUUU !
---
It's almost as if she's "Closer to the Stars".
---
I only realized this at the end, but I actually really enjoyed the idea of Kralk just being a power-hungry twisted maniac who doesn't even speak anymore. This patch sort of turned that on its head. 
---
There are many questions now. 
---
1. I am not yet sure I like this more feel-y approach to Elder Dragons. So, are they inherently good? Or just neutral, until the magic makes them mad and twisted? 
---
2. Is the madness tied to "too much magic", or to "multiple kinds of magic"? Because Zhaitan hasn't acted very differently from Kralk, and he had not much conflicting magic inside him. It was just his "own domains", shadow and death. Yet he was a power-hungry bastard as well. 
---
3. In what way is Aurene the first of her kind? Why do "multiple magics" not change her? Does this imply NO previous Elder Dragons were at peace with themselves? 
---
4. Why do Elder Dragons not fear death? Is it because they suffer so much? This was VERY vague. Aurene can resurrect because she ate Joko, so of course she doesn't have to fear death now. 
---
5. Why was there no explanation on Glint's mention of Ascension in ep5? I hope they don't just drop that. Please don't. 
---
6. As you said, why did Kralk mention his mother? Is she still out there? Will she be relevant? Or was this just there to be the final nail in the coffin of uncaring, "unrelatable" Elder Dragons? Would be kind of sad if that is all there was.
---
Same problem, different time though. Let's say for example, the egg hatches at 7pm as you suggest, but you don't get your egg until 7:10pm? Well now you've got to wait until the next day, just like you do with a daily reset. Also, when you factor in specific times, are you referring to server time? Or are you referring to local time? Because if it's server time, that's going to mess with people in other timezones, because 7pm server is going to be a very different time for them locally.
---
You're essentially making an example of a more complicated system that has the same problems as the current one.
---
Sorry, I forgot you were only level 15... it’s a reference to later on in the game and world bosses (which tend to be dragons).
---
Welcome to the game! it's a heck of a lot of fun, message me if you want a EST friend in game
---
I think it was pulled out of nowhere and doesn't line up with all of the death and destruction he was creating long before he had consumed the magic of other powerful beings.  
---
(Unless there's another Elder Dragon we don't know about that he got in a fight with for some reason and destroyed for legitimate reasons, then claimed its power to try and stabilize the All, kicking off the cycle. Which... is not hinted at at all.)
---
At the end of the fight against scarlet that shows mordremoth was probably shown to create hype because it was an expansion.
---
For season 5 I don't think we needed that, we completed a fight and can finally take a breath.
---
They could even start season 5 a bit slower in which we go on vacation because Primordus and Jormag are sleeping, Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik are dead and Aurene is the replacement for the elder dragons. The only unknown "player" is steve or bubbles which has not much lore behind him.
---
And of course the "mother" part as Kralkatorrik last words.
---
Please, please grow his hair back.
---
\^ This. It's up to you! PvP, WvW, map completion, play an alt to see some of the story options and get a feel for a new class, learn to do fractals, dungeons, or raids, set yourself a goal like a legendary weapon, go do some map metas and experience the awesome ambient dialogue and events around the world. It's very richly detailed, even after 6.5 years and several map completions I still wander across stuff I haven't seen before. It's all up to what you find personally enjoyable.
---
Aw, and I cannot stress this next part enough, *hell yeh.*
---
How about you stop being a butthurt dick over nothing? The only thing I said is that it's really not hard to put a spoiler tag, because -believe it or not- new players do exists and they haven't played the whole personal story yet. I am not trying to enforce my opinion, I am just expressing it (that's what comments are about). Maybe, you shouldn't read comments if you get upset so much when someone disagrees with you.
---
spilor alert, when we kill all the dragon, aurene will be the final boss
---
I hope your health is better now.
---
Not to mention Logan and Rytlock are back to being brothers again!
---
They did .. in Jahai Bluffs I belive.
---
Movement of the World. 
---
Nothing to see here, folks.
---
*hand waves*
---
Happy cake day
---
damn so lucky i hate you
---
Well fuck. Now I regret sleeping. Should have got all the hunts and things completed instead.
---
They didn’t, they were again only mentioned quickly so we didn’t have to think about them
---
???
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Also thanks for saying you can 'LOOT' something and not saying you can 'DROP' something in this context. Whilst it still makes sense when you say the new map events can 'drop' the ascended amulets, I find myself irrationally agitated when I read people say 'I dropped this ascended amulet from the new map', which has a totally different meaning. If you dropped something, you've dropped it. Damn.
---
I've triggered myself just typing that last bit. Shit.
---
BUT MOMMY I WANT IT NOW!!!!1!111
---
Decent personal DPS versus also decent personal DPS **and** 5man quickness.
---
I don't know, the choice seems pretty clear to me unless there is someone already covering quickness.
---
So, it seems that the official forums are down. You get this message, logged in or not; 
---
&gt; No categories were found.
---
Now, normal crash or purposefully taken down due to salt floods? Hard to know for sure.
---
Both can fit that description and have several strong end game builds. Pick whichever of the class appeals to you aesthetically or thematically. Keep in mind stuff like elite specs for later on. 
---
Try both out and see what clicks. You can use all the skills and traits of each class in the PvP lobby.
---
EST like the time zone? Yeah, I'd be glad to PM later (don't have access to my pc rn)
---
I'm actually not sure - there's an NPC you have to talk to that's in an instance, and I'm not sure if you can get in there without doing episode 4 or not.
---
So the Effervescent Pod is a Potted Maguuma Lily with special effects? Looks like some kind of aura.
---
The Lilies for comparison:

AFAIK it requires the event "Speak from the lectern to lecture against Joko's brainwashing before the instructor arrives" to be active. At present, the only Domain of Vabbi instance is bugged and not starting that event -- probably because another event, "Protect the Priory explorer while he studies the academy's murals", is completely stalled.
---
There's an LFG squad trying to fill the map up and create another instance, or lure an enemy onto the stalled event NPC, right now; this also seems like a good candidate for a bugfix in the near future. You'll probably have to wait for one of those two to happen.
---
Same lol, I just bought the new re-chargeable friend teleport so I wanna test it out
---
You will be dragged by the Stop Having Fun Guys but I'm glad you're happy with the characters. I like 'em too.
---
When she wasn't on the ship I thought she died at some point and went back looking when that could happen. Glad someone else noticed it was weird
---
Ahh ok thanks! I guess I'll just do the one last episode and see what I can do from there
---
"Watch the ledges."
---
What sort of money are you willing to spend?
---
Not really, more like eating an entire cake in one sitting rather than having one piece a day to spread it out.
---
but the meta of this map is profitable
---
I found 3 large files on my C:
---
Videos around 7GB &lt;deleted&gt;
---
hiberfil.sys which is 6.8GB and pagefile.sys which is 8.3 GB
---
Maybe it's because of the Exalted (I think it was them?) Who 'purified' Glint? 
---
And fair, having a trope be the explanation can definitely be a little anti climatic. I hope that they give us a hard lore explanation at some point.
---
It's not hard to put a spoiler tag, but it's also unnecessary by the rules of the subreddit and by common sense as well.
---
It's also not hard to say to yourself "this part of the story is almost a decade old and happens way before the player reaches Lv80; I'll just keep my Police Nanny tendancies to myself".
---
Time gating is literally the best of those options, because all you need is time. Difficulty? That's going to piss off people who can't reach that skill level because they're going to feel like they're cut off from a piece of content. Grind? Those get complained about already. Putting any grind in to lengthen out content always results in complaints from people who hate grinding, which is a lot of people.
---
At least with time gating, it simply means playing the waiting game. It means you can go and do other stuff, on other characters or in other games without feeling like you have to push yourself to skill up, or force yourself through the grind.
---
I don’t want to pay anymore than $1000 AUD which is about 700US.
---
I’m happy to buy second hand but I just want to know what I should look out for in specs
---
Yeah but that backpack is exotic, they're referring to ascended items.
---
Waiting for Dragondance
---
/r/suggestalaptop should help you out. It's hard to say "look for this number or that number and you'll be fine" because numbers are rarely what matters on laptops.
---
My eyes already bleed with some peoples' ideas of "fashion".
---
Well it's kind of the smart sensible move after what happened to Glint, the best placement of Logan is to never rely on him in a vital role.
---
&gt;...anticlimatic?
---
I don't agree but if my choice was "anticlimactic" or the "unnecessary GW1 fan wank" of *One Path Ends*, well...
---
&gt;Anyone who has maxed PoF masteries have begun avoiding the new map / content due to wasting effort.
---
Seeing as there's a bunch of other reasons to run this map (like generating gold, other achievements, unlocking the armor), I really don't buy this reasoning. The second and fourth points are 100% valid, albeit they are the same point.
---
Time-gating never feels fun because it's an arbitrary end to the pursuit of your personal goal. That being said, the new mount doesn't have that "I need it" feeling like beetle did for some of that map. The rent-a-scales are plenty to do everything you need on the new map. While I can see some possible niche uses for skyscale on other maps, so far I think the Griffon + Springer get the job done just fine by comparison (even on this new map).
---
At least this time-gate makes more sense than that golem backpack collection. Skyscale is kind of up there with Draconis Mons' back piece, but with a map that's much easier to get around and much more rewarding to be around.
---
Wanting it *now now now* is a fair and valid response to the update. I can empathize with the people who didn't have the time to play on launch feeling like they're going to be stuck behind (but hey they get to benefit from guides at least :p). Still, it's not like this mount is shaping up to be a best-in-slot type of deal. It's a nice send off from the story and expansion.
---
The faster we get everything done and unlocked, the sooner we can get back online complaining about "a days worth of content every three months".
---
I think it's more of a change of heart or change of context. 
---
Elder Dragons don't need to fear death to act in self defense - they'll all fight back when threatened, because they're just trying to do their job. With Glint and Aurene prophesizing a world without him or otherwise sending capable warriors to defeat him, it was a threat to whatever it was they were meant to be doing/protecting in containing each of their domains of magic. 
---
The difference this time was that the death *needed* to happen, because of the conflicting magics that we're corrupting him. That job was no longer as important with a capable new adolescent dragon to contain the wild magics, so that fearlessness could actually be realized this time
---
&gt; why doesn't it recover stamina while on a wall? 
---
I'm really really hoping this is a mastery...otherwise I really dislike the wall-cling since you can't move, and can't recover...it's pointless.
---
&gt; What actually makes it glide to recover stamina when you're moving? 
---
This is the finicky part. Angle up just a hair too much and it is being counted as "ascending" which uses up the stamina. But angle down just a little, and it will glide to regain stamina. There need to be a neutral zone or something on this things movement while in the air. 
---
I'm really hoping that the masteries make this thing easier to use, because right now it seems kinda...crippled.
---
I know your jokong but this would be such an easy cosmetic edition. I'm surprised it's not a thing
---
Oh you speak for the majority do you. That's fairly arrogant of you to say.
---
And of-fucking-course I'm supporting Anet. I think it was a fantastic conclusion. You disagree. Fine, go make your own thread filled with whatever negativity you feel is apt.
---
Tybalt, that is enough
---
http://i.imgur.com/fCWdg.png
---
Are people that starved for Spirit Shards? The new armor costs like 38 total for all 3 sets and if your goal is a legendary then hopefully you've been playing a bit longer to stockpile on them from other PvE or load up on some tomes from spvp/wvw.
---
Yeah not getting EXP for the PoF zones kind of sucks, but it's not like players are starving for shards / have no other way to get them :V
---
As Minstrel Firebrand you're basically invincible in fractals if you play it right.
---
The aegis spam is very strong in fractals since it can help your party avoid 1-shot mechanics in certain places.
---
Bow of Truth is an insanely strong healing skill that can cover a very large area so even parties that tend to scatter are no problem.
---
Merciful Intervention. This is one of the best skills to revive downed players in fractals because of how fast you can use it.
---
On top of all of this you have insane utility with reflects, resistance, pushes and pulls.
---
Literally felt this same feeling when going for the Pvp back piece. I was like "please instead of 3 a day make it 1000 per achievement!"
---
I'm on the opposite side of the spectrum and feel like this was a complete let down after Episode 5's climatic ending. Badly written, rushed, and wrapped up even quicker than previous episodes. Left me hanging with a feeling of "... that's it?"
---
So what? It doesn’t matter that they are physically different, don’t have the same background nor belong to the same species?
---
As much as I don’t disagree with your overall points from earlier in this thread, you’re getting close to mental gymnastics territory to support a wrong point.
---
I know what you're talking about, but I think loot/drop was actually used incorrectly in this case. Would it not make more sense for the title of this thread to be "PSA: New map events can **drop** ascended amulets"? The map event doesn't loot anything, the player does.
---
I think the sentence in the post would make sense either way.
---
Love it thanks
---
it's one of only 3 paths at that level lmao and it's so easy to level alts in this game. 
---
but sure sure the only people who have ever seen the ending of the much-discussed Whispers subplot are the ones who've been playing since 2012!! dude your mind will be blown when you get to this thing called "Living World" 
---
Tybalt is the most well-known Order mentor anyways, followed by Sieran and then Forgal, there's plenty of fanart and memes of him and his demise. no excuse
---
Thank you my brother I have made a post
---
"When is something no longer a spoiler" is a long standing debate that will never end.
---
[Here's a less blown out version](https://i.imgur.com/kQ9n8Yw.jpg)
---
&gt;The lobby based PvP
---
you don't need to be in the lobby to play PVP, you can queue up anywhere in the world, and it puts you back where you were when you are done.
---
"... and man the cannons." (paraphrase)
---
I was so happy we got a followup here because Taimi was *noticeably* brighter after Sayida said that.
---
I see Kralk dropped every single infusion.
---
Those drop from any PoF-exclusive champ bags. As you said, they're rare, but not something introduced this patch.
---
send me free strange rock.. i have no clue what that is.. pm my info
---
Repeat? So we have to do the steps outlined in this post 5 times, it's not gonna be a different collection area?
---
Easy to get onto, just go to the Broken Wing cliff
---
I'm at work now but you can add me if ya like Sieg.9530. Play most evenings and weekends. Barely skimmed the surface on anything but open world. I've played the game off and on in short jogs but consider myself very new still. I get lost in all the abbreviations when people chat. Wouldn't mind just partying up sometime and killing things. :)
---
There is an armor set to work on and the map drops a ton of loot for doing events. If that's not enough you might as well quit playing since there wont be new maps for every ep of LWS5. You'll never be satisfied.
---
i mentioned why i switched. 
---
standing at the boss or trash group and everybody else playing range and running around in different directions is annoying as fu..
---
and when the Pugs doing 3k instead of 2k dps because of quickness. not worth it :-)
---
btw. i'm doing 40k-70k trash pulls with my reaper ( wenn having Chrono support ).
---
i never did so much dps with my Quickbrand.
---
If you need help getting them working properly again, you can send me a pm :)
---
When my main points of comparison in this case are the three prior Living Story seasons, yeah, it doesn't take a lot to stand out.  The conclusion of this episode actually feels like the natural endpoint to which the season has been building, as opposed to leaving us with substantial cliffhangers, like seasons 1&amp;2, or being almost completely superfluous, like the end of LS3.
---
I may have to redownload GW2. I always loved my Scrapper but gyros were a pain to use and felt kinda useless.
---
Why is everyone complaining about the daily lock instead of the probably 40+ hours of collections we're going to have to do? Did everyone plan on doing all of that in one sitting?
---
No, I farmed mawdrey and then never went back.
---
I got the ascension faster than 5 seasons I'm sure.
---
&gt; Dont forget that Kralk is Prophetic the same as Glint and we know that one of his vision of a world without him scared him greatly.
---
Yeah, and wouldn't you think trying to remain peaceful and reach a mutually acceptable compromise ("I don't WANT all this magic, take it and just let me live in peace!") sounds like a better option than putting a giant purple glowing target on your head for the entire world to see? 
---
&gt; the other thing is we know that Death was not the problem but what if his abscence without a Good Heir was what scared him so much
---
Where are you getting that from? Kralk's final conversation feels more like him making the most of what he has left, accepting his (very much unwanted) death and seeking comfort in Aurene as "his" legacy.
---
I speak for the majority of what I'm reading here and on the forums. You seem quite distressed not to be part of it.
---
THANKS OBAMA
---
I was worried with all the layoffs and upheaval the company has had over recent months we'd see a decline. I personally loved the last two episodes and it rounded off everything nicely. I can't wait for season 5!
---
Too bad turrets have been useless for pretty much the entire time.
---
The gold you need if you want to craft everyparts is pretty much 800-1000 gold
---
you need a little less than 200 gold to put the 2 Crafting discipline (armor and weapon ) to 500
---
and after that you can count a little less than 100 gold per pieces
---
Isn't that the point of a season finale, closing the current plot, **and** opening a new one ?
---
Yeah, if you specifically focus on HoM points it can be quite fast I guess. I wouldn't know about that because I only reached 30/50 after maybe 1100 hours, but that is because I started playing the game in 2006 and played for fun instead of grinding achievements. I only really focused on getting those last points sometime around the 1000-hour mark. (sorry for no particular content or advice on my part)
---
There's a difference between staggering content and preventing abuse. 
---
You clearly don't know the difference. Cheers
---
We haven't had any Cantha or Bubbles though.
---
It's not. I've seen it multiple times. Check out the Priory people in the dwarven ruins in Desert Highlands, specifically the room where Rhoban hangs out. You'll see a norn who looks just like this.
---
Healer FB helps keep people alive.
---
The sheer output of AEGIS &amp; protection in addition to the heals is quite insane.
---
Interesting, how do you use them for that?
---
HEY do you want some chill people to play with and answer your questions? I have a teaching guild and you seem like the kind of chill person we’d love to have! Let me know and I can get you the hookups. DM me if you’re interested and we can get you in the Discord and the in-game guild! (Also you get 15% off teleport fees with the guild, yeeeeeeaaaaaaah!)
---
WELCOME TO THE GAME
---
Pretty much all my feelings summed up in one sentence.
---
Aw hell yeh dude
---
I feel the same way, just started and it really feels like the perfect representation of an MMO usually depicted in anime and stuff. Instantly hooked.
---
Not really. If anything, it felt more like a part 2 or a continuation of the previous episode.
---
Tried this game, was cool but seemed to hollow (eg its basically a dress up game). Waiting for wow classic, the ultimate mmo.
---
Yea, i think this is what im going to gear then as my group does go down often and scatter alot.
---
Quite true. This was basically a filler episode.
---
I need to hear that.
---
I'm pretty sure that isn't her official body, more just a symbolic representation, emphasizing the head and wings. I'm sure her full reveal will happen eventually, different proportions and all.
---
What /u/Rynam90 said is accurate, if you have both expansions, the visuals may be a tad different  if you don't have both expansions (LS3 requires HoT and LS4 requires PoF)
---
When I heard the line from Glint about a new world waiting to be built, at the end of this shot I thought they were going to pan up to the skies and fade in either the new Expac logo or a GW3 logo. 
---
Ah well, a man can dream.
---
&gt; This will keep the map alive for a long time
---
This map (and all of PoF technically) won’t reward exp and so, not give spirit shards until the mount is unlocked... Which is at least Saturday for those who focus on it, later for the rest.
---
It can potentially do the opposite of keeping the map alive.
---
It's not terrible but it's not amazing either. The Scrappers I've seen in pugs are actually just DPS Holosmiths that swapped out to Scrapper for specific skips with Stealth Gyro, and then back to Holo for the actual fights.   
---
The meta support duo these days is Firebrand + Renegade, followed up by Chrono + Druid. I'm not familiar with details of heal Scrapper build but there would be a lot of things that the Scrapper would have to provide in order to replace Druid. How's Scrapper's: 
---
- Might/Fury/Stability/Protection generation  
---
- CC
---
- other utilities (keep in mind you have to compete with Spirits)
---
Hes a panda :&lt;
---
turrets are cool, but my guy, flamethrower kit has me hooked. cant wait to try the mortar kit as well.
---
Honestly it felt just rushed in first part and rather good in the epilogue. Whole voice acting in first chapter was SO BAD.
---
I think treating whole hero cast like complete monkeys that do not wonder what happened with Aurene due to Joko magic... is in line with Turion sitting in crypt full of corpses while Winterfell is being attacked by dead rising Witch King. Like everybody saw its coming and nobody saw it in story? Just crap writing.
---
Just imagine Bhram coming to everybody with thought that Joko magic actually can keep Aurine still alive and we start episode with search for Joko staff parts to kickstart his magic...
---
r/UnexpectedMonsterHunter
---
Well that's good at least.
---
What is C by default? Right now its Utility skill 2 for me.
---
Aurene, the Prismatic Dragon
---
Indeed she says that, in the Olmakhan camp interact with her.
---
Already updated. Ran raids yesterday after reset with no issues from arc.
---
So now Aurene can awaken dead bodies?
---
Daily Fractals are time gates. But you can still play them for less rewards. Same with weakly raids. And with collections. I bet you didn’t finish every collection. And now there is one where you get something big but you have a time gate.
---
My first character was an engineer because of all the different kits but that was definitely a different game back then. Tho a mortar kit + turrets could be fun lol
---
Don’t forget their Jamocha Shake!
---
&gt; filler
---
Filler episodes tend to have *nothing important* happen in them at all. It may not have been totally up to a lot of people's expectations but it was not remotely filler.
---
I... I'm sorry commander.
---
Your EXP bar is locked off, you aren't accruing anything towards Spirit Shards until the entire collections are complete. That's what they meant.
---
They usually discount PoF and the bundle, and leave HoT alone. You can buy the bundle and give the PoF key to a friend.
---
While we ‘wait’ we’re locked out of exp and spirit shards though...
---
&gt;my local apple seller
---
Either you have weirdly specific local stores... or you might be under watch of goverment officials
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character
---
You can get a nice set of Berserker exotic armor from CoE or CoF dungeon, then you can get scholar runes and then work on fractals and ascended.
---
you'll probably wanna go dragonhunter and 100% berserker gear
---
Depends. In bad groups that die a lot and don't stack, it's always gonna be Scourge.
---
If your group is good but doesn't stack, Tempest.
---
If your group stacks and sucks anyway, Firebrand.
---
If your group stacks, cant jump, and their dps sucks, Chrono.
---
Okay, that makes sense then. Thanks!
---
Frontier is optional. U can use Claw of Jormag event instead for that part.
---
Thank you!
---
Zhaitain did talk to us. Just through his minions. So far most of the dragons talk to us through their minds. The exception is Mordremoth depending on if you view his Mouth as his body or not
---
That's not the job of an FBI.
---
I still think it's more like... Elder Dragons are BIG. They're much bigger than us, and not just size: in power, in age, in mind.
---
Do humans think about field mice when they have ever a field to build a WalMart? Not really. Do you think about the ants you step on when you go for a walk? 
---
The difference between Aurene (and Glint and Vlast before her) and Kralk is that Aurene thinks about the field mice. And goes "Maybe there's a way to not kill all these mice?"
---
If anet is playing a long game that's more than a decade in the making then props to them? 
---
Joko has deep roots in gw1 and almost certainly wasn't created just to be eaten now. 
---
He was a self regenerating lich, eating him was also one of the few reasonably convincing ways to finally really end him.
---
There's a problem with this though...
---
FB is reliant on consistent stacking which most groups and almost all bad ones rarely if at all do.
---
Hell, I might join you, since I want to start playing again.
---
Is this what you recomend ? https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Support_Healer
---
Could somebody give me a TLDR on this please? I finished the story but I thought Id get the mount later for once so I didnt rush and play into it at all. I also havent looked up what is required so Im not sure of this blocking you are all speaking of... whats up? what happened?
---
He was just trying to get away from Grandma Gwen. Rytlock was like no.... seriously.... you stay.
---
Just saying, if I'm picking teams, I'm taking Rytlock over Logan 10 times out of 10.
---
Well the one dragon was wounded.  But the the rest, yeah...
---
I think you only get one key when you buy the bundle tho?
---
Nope not very great.
---
Mainly because it doesn’t bring any good offensive buffs.
---
Druid was nerfed, and is not that great anymore because of the same reason. The only offensive buff it has is spotter, and most people build without it, so it doesn’t matter anyways. Frost spirit is also a offensive buff, but you can just have a soulbeast bring it.
---
The best support atm is firebrigade (quickness firebrand and alacrity renegade). Firebrand has perfect insriptions, while rene has soulcleave summit and assassins presence, all giving a huge boost to dps for the group, along with potential to get superior heals compared to druid.
---
What does scrapper bring? Uhh.. a lil barrier I guess? And stealth I guess. Then just a shit ton of heals. The thing is, especially in t4 and cm fractals, people know how to play, so they don’t need excessive healing like in wvw or pvp bunkering. Most things can be dodged, and the little healing you need can be covered by druids relatively weak heals or a soulcleave summit and firebrand. Scrapper doesn’t do enough things as a support like druid chrono or firebrigade. You have 5 slots in fractals, and you’re wasting 1 on an undying rock. This is not optimal for fast clears people want.
---
Furthermore, it’s not going to be fun for you. Not only will it take more time because of the little help you’ll do, but people will know you’ll drag them down. No matter how good you are, you literally are a dedicated weight the team has to carry through challenging fractals. In cm’s you probably won’t even find a group that won’t kick you.
---
PLEASE DONT DO THIS TO YOURSELF.
---
For your own sanity.
---
Check out the good fractal builds [here](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/hybrid-renegade).
---
I would recommend the meta builds. Anything else not in that section is done better by another class. 
---
And don’t even THINK about gearing a Druid. It’s just not as great, and even pugs are moving off the druid chrono meta into firebrigade. Druid will be dead in fractals in the near future. Not so much in raids, but that’s another story.
---
The meta builds at the link will give you the most room for improvement, and ease in finding pugs and being accepted as a good player. Of course, you’ll need to put in the practice to master the classes for the best results.
---
If you want to play engi, build a power holosmith. It’s good dps. Not the best, but still great and will produce great numbers if played properly.
---
Please feel free to ask questions :D
---
During this scene i took a lot of screenshots, only to later realize that my mouse is always in it :(
---
\[[https://static.staticwars.com/quaggans/cry.jpg](https://static.staticwars.com/quaggans/cry.jpg)\](:((((((((((((((((()
---
I think you just have to hang out for a bit and wait for a defense event to start. I've never had to wait more than a few minutes so far.
---
Condi Greatsword Chrono
---
Cyanide looks ballar
---
&gt;i mentioned why i switched.
---
I didn't consider it a valid argument, I usually ask people to stack and they do, if they don't I leave the group because who has time for that kind of retardation.
---
&gt;and when the Pugs doing 3k instead of 2k dps because of quickness.
---
A DPS class doing that amount of DPS is something I rarely see, even for the most mediocre builds.
---
&gt;i'm doing 40k-70k trash pulls with my reaper
---
that's incredibly inconsequential for most fractals though. How's your boss DPS, how's your party's total DPS when using reaper versus quickbrand?, just watching your numbers in the best scenarios is kinda... silly.
---
exactly
---
This. I think making the elder dragons the targets of our adventure was a little sad because I LOVE the idea that these huge creatures just exist and cause natural disasters because it's just how the world works. Not because they mean to.
---
Just imagine actual Mother is... well we are not on the globe but riding in the back of giant space Mother dragon... what a brain fart.
---
Welcome commander &lt;3
---
Actually she used Caithe to speak, she didn't speak by herself, as she can now.
---
Just becauese I am forced to do the content for 5 days it doesnt mean its 5 day worth amount of content. They did the same with HoT and mastery grind and story locks behind it.
---
aurene finally reached the endgame, shiny as a Christmas tree, now she can sand next to all the infusion stacking people out there
---
Tendies and curly fries, yes yes and yes @_@
---
Do you remember when they had those weird like... Chicken Tumbler things? It was a self contained popcorn chicken/chicken nugget cannister where you put the sauce inside and shook it all around. I wish they'd bring that back!
---
Ohhh, that's a good point. I think you got me there.
---
&gt; "Elder dragons fear nothing, not even death."
---
&gt; "I hope you never have to kill what you love."
---
These, under that light, make a lot more sense. Kralk would have known that a brighter future would require him out of the picture, but in order to accomplish that, he would have to be killed. The problem occurred when he got super-charged, almost making him unkillable. Remember the Pact was ready to start attacking Kralk back in LS2 before Mordremoth reared his head.
---
So when he became maddened with magic, he started fighting for survival and destruction rather than letting himself fall and fulfill that prophecy. He became blinded, as he put it.
---
Wat lol? 
---
There are 4 normal waypoints, not one.
---
There is extra 3 unlocable waypoints, for a total of 7, which is more than any map after hot.
---
Also you are complaining you need to explore the map for a one time achievement?!? I guess you must be one of them pof players, used to get everything free without any work.
---
&gt; And there aren't ridiculous limitations for F2P players 
---
There's some decent limitations for F2P players.  But you can certainly still enjoy the game :)
---
I have been just playing but I get disproportionate ammount of stuff. So much bloodred bricks and so few stars. 10 to 1 i think is my current rate
---
Dont worry, dulfy didnt cover these. You can find locations on reddit. Some were really tough to find, was in a squad that mapped them. Yikes.
---
?   
---
It's quite literally the opposite, if they made lockout last night your 1 whole collection behind. Browse the treads a bit, a lot of people complaining about this exact situation.   
---
If you don't make the collection each day your so behind it's insane (have you even seen pt.2?).  
---
Also "GW2" and "playing like a fulltime job" doesn't belong anywhere near each other in the same sentence lmao   
---
This is the most casual friendly MMO in existence.
---
Ohh, didnt know that!
---
Updated arcDPS still have issues together with latest d912pxy. They both work if used seperately thou. Hmm... Difficult choice, gfx lull-lull or DPS data...
---
Chill out bruh XD
---
I found it way more confusing that we fall out of the mist to a perfect infrastructured new island. I mean, how long did we fall? 2 weeks?
---
We hear from Marjory in Thunderhead Keep, sending a message to Taimi. But you're right that they don't physically appear all season which kinda sucks
---
Kingslayer...:(
---
And I forgot the full grown version cool.
---
Honestly it was such a beautiful response. Like you know someone at some high intensity moment like that is just gonna fucking snap and laugh because they don’t know what else to do.
---
Taimi reads us the message right? We didn’t actually hear Marjory’s voice, so she had no dialogue all season.
---
So what? Still I do not understand. Maybe something takes a while longer. Sorry.. I simply fo not understand.
---
holy crap  
---
he actually friggin did it  
---
imma gonna send you a thank you and a half in the pm but thank you so much i seriously can't express what this means to me
---
Why even timegate in GW2?
---
It's not like you're extending our subscription time like in WoW or some shit.
---
Honestly, I would have had Aurene’s rez + talking at the end of the last episode, instead of at the start of the first. Aurene looks dead, everyone’s shell shocked, and the commander, desperate and borderline traumatized from all the shit she’s gone through in Elona, starts pulling the chunks of crystal off of Aurene’s corpse. Everyone’s like “Commander no” and trying to stop what they think is a futile expression of grief and denial.... but then Aurene starts glowing.
---
And as the last crystal is removed, she comes back due to Joko-magic. She gives a brief explanation before vanishing into the mists to keep the heat on her injured granddad, and Dragon’s Watch is left to realize that while the fight isn’t over, this no longer feels like a hopeless war in which the commander is throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. It feels like they have a real, tangible chance. That all the deaths against Kralk haven’t been in vain. That they could — no, *will* — win. That they have hope.
---
And then the episode ends there and this episode could start with Aurene swooping in on the Commander and being like “get in loser we’re going dragon hunting”
---
This would play much better into the tone of the rest of the episode (which was great as a standalone, but as a resolution to Episode 5 is pretty lackluster), which is very triumphant and hopeful. Angst and despair are tasty fucking narrative morsels, but require a bit more of a deft hand and doesn’t automatically make a story better. Hope isn’t a dirty word. Tragedy for tragedy’s sake means nothing, and that’s coming from someone who loves himself a good bit of angst.
---
And really, the biggest problem was the way they played Aurene’s death as this big Sad Thing with the Requiem stories and whatnor for fives months and then were like “psyche!” in the first five minutes of this episode. Like, bitch, I was writing fanfic in my head about the commander’s grief and ultimate despair and then you go and pull that shit. Nah. I like this episode and I knew she was coming back, but that was cheap.

I give it a week and a half before they Istan it

The dragons are forces of nature.

The meteorite that wiped out the dinosaurs wasn't evil. Neither are the dragons

Just checked my email, only one serial for "gw2 standard collection" when I bought both expansions directly from the website
---
" I decided to post this after hearing the concerns of people in Map Chat, my Guilds, and friends across Discord, etc. "
---
Yes... sure... your guild... all of map chat... all your discord pals. 
---
Isn't it time for this community as whole to drop these sock puppet arguments ?
---
Speak for yourself. Don't try and pass yourself as speaking for others. If they really believed as strong as you they would speak out for themselves. The fact that you need "speak up for others" takes away from the points you are making, it doesn't add anything to the conversation. It turns your argument  into yet another stale meme.
---
ill keep in mind :)
---
Executive dysfunction is a hell of a drug.
---
Sure. Like me few months ago. But, still... Where is the problem? It is still just a game.
---
Huh. It definitely used to be two separate keys.
---
Can anyone points me to a guide about intermediate knowledge of rune, sigil, crest?
---
such as which one is good, expensive, worth to keep
---
a tried-and-true combo of skill+rune
---
or how to find good sigil
---
What does RA stand for?
---
I thought it meant she was the first dragon that would be benevolent
---
The spider part tho. Said F word more than ever
---
I guess in the end it depends on your gameplay.
---
If you wanna do endgame PvE, nobody will invite you if you're wearing full soldier armor. Your DPs will be very low.
---
However, Soldier armor will get you thru the game perfectly fine! It may not get you in endgame PvE, but it'll get you thru GW2.
---
But...... it's better to learn to survive than have a crutch (soldier armor). endgame PvE is all about berzerker. Learn to dodge!
---
Is it perhaps tied to the DERV escort back at the main camp?
---
You don't speak for any majority. You speak for yourself. I'm not at all distressed.
---
I like your honesty and your sarcasm.
---
Why don't they discount HoT too? Don't enough people buy it?
---
Like most mature MMORPG’s you may find relatively few players while you’re leveling to level cap, as most players are 80 and doing endgame stuff or playing on the level 80 maps.  But at 80 it’s very active and easy to find groups for anything.
---
What is the most important thing about her ? Her story/development is literraly : " Hey I'm here, I'm lesbian and I've a dead sister. "
---
She's a lesbian figure for quota or conviction and that's all, wich is ridiculous.
---
I didnt say it wasnt profitable

and Kralk's to blame~ ♪
---
I haven't done *any* of the current season, that's how long it's been. Logged in to snag each episode but I've not played more than an hour in at least 6 months. 
---
Kinda want to find someone I know IRL that wants to commit to a 1-80+xpacs&amp;lw run (rip season 1), but that's a damned pipe dream. 😂
---
its not a 20 minute thing, took me like 5 hours total to do both daily meta achievs. it's a hassle but still shouldnt be timegated
---
It’s interesting to see him buried in the ground as he was when asleep. He has basically returned to being a mountain in the middle of a map, this time permanently.
---
It was sort of becoming a meme, I think, with how many people died in the story up through the start of PoF.
---
Going to try and clear these things up to the best of my ability:
---
1. Kralkatorrik is/was a force of nature who played a role in re-balancing magic. They're not good or bad, but they can be considered the latter because they often have to cause mass destruction to achieve that goal. Which brings me to the next point.
---
2. Madness is tied to both. In a sense, possessing "multiple kinds of magic" is the same as "too much magic". One of the reasons why magic was sealed and split into schools using the bloodstones was because individuals harnessed multiple kinds of magic and became mad and hungry for more, a big problem that spawned the Guild Wars. Elder Dragons are not an exception to this rule. When Elder Dragons wake up, it's to release the overwhelming amount of magic that they absorbed when they were sleeping, not to absorb more, and that's why they go on a rampage, that's why they act the same.
---
3. Aurene is the first of her kind because she was formed from different types of magic because it went into the egg that she hatched from. Again, the Elder Dragons wake up when there is too much magic within them that drives them crazy, so it's not really a matter of being at peace with themselves.
---
4. Elder Dragons don't fear death because, again, they're forces of nature. They do feel pain however, and they probably don't enjoy that.
---
5. Ascension was something tied specifically to the Flameseeker Prophecies. It's not really that relevant to us. 
---
6. Remember that weird line where Kralkatorrik said something like "You were of me, now I will be of you"? That's what I think it is referring to.
---
This is likely happening because of temp files created during the copy process, which are by default stored on your OS drive. The temp files will be quite sizable so there isn't enough room to store both them and the game you are trying to copy. 
---
Two optoins: 
---
1. Try **cutting** and pasting the game folder rather than **copying**, this should remove the need for temp files. 
---
2. If that doesn't work, you can [change the location of your temp folder to another drive.](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/change-location-of-temp-files-folder-to-another/19f13330-dde1-404c-aa27-a76c0b450818). This will prevent your C: drive from filling up with temp files during the transfer. Once you're done I would recommend reverting the change.
---
Why not? If you would take time off to do anything, why not a hobby you enjoy, playing with friends?
---
I'm still waiting for a fiery guild hall since HoT (e.g. : on the Burning isles, in the Depths of Tyria, or even in the Catacombs of Kathandrax if we ever go there one day), but this decoration will do it in the meantime ! 
---
Thanks to the dev who made it !
---
I'm not sure, honestly.
---
It seems like you don't know anything about the map. It have one waypoint in base. It have 3 more in each line. They are not always up. If the map is new it doesn't have them. It need escort event to unlock them. They are temporarily, after meta reset, map also reset - so no waypoints except one in base. But ok, let's be yours...
---
Dragonchoke hopefully for for DSD
---
It doesnt have to be punishing, it essensially gives you more things to do on a daily basis to break the monotonious routine you've been doing pre patch
---
I feel like it's very safe to say they'll both be on sale during GW2's anniversary celebration later this year.
---
WvW barely got hit by it though.
---
To answer you OP, yes Herald is plenty viable as a WvW roamer. Very effective in fact. You have to play smart though and know when to engage and when not to.
---
Loot &amp; Karma? Whatever gave you the impression XP was the most relevant part of the reward?
---
Glad to see you're liking it! I had pretty much the same progression, moving from mmo to mmo before finding this one.
---
And really, could it have been anything else? You can just *hear* the catharsis in his voice, and you know we were all thinking it - it's the perfect brick joke to tie up that particular plot thread.
---
If you are a new player you shouldn't be going for an endgame reward unless you want everything at once. And that's not anets fault. How spoiled can some people be? I wonder how they do in other mmos which are waaaaaay worse than this.
---
good bot
---
I mean i don't know you IRL but that's what I'll be doing, I played in the beta but dropped out before the first expac and only came back now so I'm running my characters through the whole adventure from the start. I have 10ish level 80 characters which have only done personal story
---
Wasn’t Scarlet sort of sympathetic? Like yeah she did evil but we know what was in her mind now.
---
Armchair authors at their best =)
---
I finished the collection now and got to wait for the eggs to hatch, but until now i didn't even have to change the map to complete it.
---
I been playing for 6 years. I understand what you're experiencing.
---
Nope, while there aren’t many disappointments with this episode, this is one of them.
---
It is a perfect example of the cluster of this season for Anet. 1.5 years of work, messy IRL events, and then not an accessory to put a bow on the season.
---
["Just a bit of your soul...you won't miss it."](https://i.redd.it/hfe0k34bwwv21.jpg)
---
One of the biggest problems with coming back to the game has been the lack of excitement in loot. The steady trickle of material and gold is boring. I feel like a garbage man after finishing something in this game.
---
The whole "they're mindless forces of nature beyond the concepts of good and evil" is the initial presentation that gives thrown aside in the personal story. That's meant to be the uneducated perspective of Tyrians who have not learned much about the Elder Dragons. The whole thing about "their purpose is to consume magic then go to sleep" is also false and was never actually mentioned in the lore (it's a common player misunderstanding of the Elder Dragons' natural role in balancing magic; the Elder Dragons balance it from one extreme to another but this is not necessary, nor is the extremes part of their purpose).
---
They're fully sapient and knowing full well what they're doing and that they don't actually need to do that. Actively knowing they're enslaving individuals when corrupting them (arguable exception of Jormag who focuses on corrupting willing converts).
---
As for the notion of them ever having good - this aspect is presented solely with Kralkatorrik. One can easily twist the actions of risen and Zhaitan as a twisted perspective of once being good though. For example, the risen's dialogue, structure, and way they and Zhaitan act all suggest that Zhaitan's end-goal was to rule as king over a nation where no one dies or loses loved ones. Depending on one's perspective and reasoning, this alone can be depicted as very empthatic and make Zhaitan seem like a caring individual - after all, wouldn't it be kindness to remove the loss and pain of death and separation for others? But then we have the obvious notion that he fulfills this by forcibly slaughtering and raising everyone he can, without giving them a choice, enslaving them to his will so that they have no choice but to agree with his methods and beliefs, and using that love others have for each other to get any who's resisting to give up.
---
Harder to present this for Mordremoth's actions or Primordus'. Jormag's actions could also be interpreted as "good intentions gone evil" if you want to spin it such a direction. But all the same, none of them are hinted or implied to have ever been "good" who went evil due to magic overdose like the implications created for Kralkatorrik. It certainly isn't a case of this evil nature coming from the conflicting nature of multiple Elder Dragons' magic (rather, this seems to only make it worse, make the Torment within him stronger and in more control). The mentality presented by the Torment also matches the description presented in Edge of Destiny when Snaff dived into Kralk's mind, as well as Glint's own words. So if he were once good, it would have been eons ago, long before Glint's oldest memories of 3,000 years.
---
No, New legendary trinket is link to raid so, no new raid content = No new legendary trinket
---
I purchased HoT for half off about a week prior to this current sale from GW2 store. Think they also had just POF prior to HoT sale. I was watching pricing since I already had POF.
---
I really hope we don't have to do that because I really don't have enough gold to get a griffon and buying Daybreak just to get the Skyscale isn't exactly money saving either.
---
The waterdragon?
---
Mordremoth's domains were plant and mind, while Zhaitan's were death and shadow. They don't really cancel each other out like ice and fire do, which is why Jormag and Primordus are each other's weakness.
---
Functional legendaries, if not special.
---
There is a reason I'm chasing them half assedly
---
But she had to die in order to ascend and fullfill her destiny.
---
This whole season has been about Aurene´s journey, from maturing and getting bigger, then to get more powerful and establish a link with her champion, to earn Joko's magic, a part of the prophecy as Ogden told us, to then doing the ultimate sacrifice and dying protecting what she loves, so she can come back more powerful than ever, as Glint probably told her.
---
Her death was part of her journey, because like the trailer said "Death is not the end, but possibly the end of the beggining". Aurene reached her full potential once she came back from the dead.
---
I'd run something like this:

---
Keep in mind that you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to utility skills and your off-hand weapon alongside the shield.
---
You give drakes a bad name
---
Yep, and don't forget the dungeon cutscenes and the original personal story ending cutscene!
---
Oh, well that makes sense. I was thinking of the basic attack animations, from what I remember it shows the weapons themselves, but probably just a generic dagger.
---
There was an entire book worth of character development for Logan along with multiple in game storylines dealing with him. 
---
The problem with Jory was she was introduced interesting character set up that was largely thrown away to focus on two badly written story threads that didn’t even handle the subject matter well
---
Bad writing is bad writing regardless of sexuality. 
---
There were a lot of bad story elements in the game early on, anet have always had good lorecrafting while often struggling with storytelling. Things have been improved upon since LS3 started but Marjory’s character has been left out of those improvements.
---
Do you know perhaps know what kind of loot you would like to see?
---
I used to hate draconis mons, with collection i grew to understand it and now i like it.
---
And honestly its not like game forces you to have skyscale, its not mandatory, so its not a big deal.
---
Just like with griffon, everyone complained how expensive it was.
---
fooker... thats right! u heard it here first folks
---
Yeah, that was weird. When we are chasing Kralk in the mists I was sure it was all an an hallucination caused by one of Aurene's echoes were she would show us the key to defeat him, and after we woke up, she would remain dead.
---
It's nice having her back, but I expected something else. Maybe if you play both episodes back to back it wouldn't be as bad, just a minor setback, but after having three months to grief and let her death sink in, it felt a bit cheap.
---
What worries me now is... Aurene has absorbed even more magic than Kralk did, can't she go crazy as well?
---
Exactly what I was thinking, it's really striking how odd it looks on the world map.
---
Some of us didn't find a problem with it
---
Agreed. This felt like a proper conclusion, not a stupid side story
---
Oh I must have missed it then :(
---
There's no sexual tension, she just wants to tell him she's gonna live with the Olmakhan now, but she can't muster up the courage to tell him. They're such good friends that they're essentially siblings and she doesn't know how to tell him without hurting him (and we all know how well he handles sudden departures).
---
I did feel a bit sorry for him but  wouldn't go as far as to say he went insane. He was a bad dragon, he simply acknowledged it.
---
I tried to use vectors to create an Emblem out of a screenshot taken at about the same time.

wow amazing, you compared chekov to something a 7 year old would write...
---
Sure absolutely but we are talking ALL legendary items from PvP. (All weights + the back piece).. those pictures are epic for sure is what I’m saying lol.. far above what I do..
---
The ascension itself is really really fast, easy, and mostly fun if you enjoy PvP with its timegate as 60 days (15x4 participation quest) and 125 PvP tickets (tickets cap is 100 per season) so it’s actually stupid fast for a “legendary item” and can be as fast as 1 full season (2wks offseason), and +4 days from the next season.... It’s the 1st legendary item I made haha, love em’
---
i see what you did there
---
You asked for a single reason and I gave you one: I played 3 hours yesterday like most people and my friends didn't rush part 2 without me since they can't do part 3 anyway.
---
But you have a point: if you didn't do part 1 yesterday you can't catch up. They should change that so that every part unlocks at fixed days for everyone.
---
Dragons are early forms of the bloodstones?
---
interesting? I wish we had some of the seers or other ancient races around to talk to more
---
I don't mind them bringing her back; in fact many people predicted that this was EXACTLY what was going to happen.
---
The way they brought her back tho, it was horribly misshanled and their publicity was awfuly manipulative. They showed character insights, streamer reactions, they had interviews about Aurene's death and its meaning, HECK, they even talked about death in the trailer and suddenly.... DISNEY MAGIC!
---
They literally manipulated the players for views, likes and comments, they said they planned her death for a year. It was deliberate.
---
They handled her revival in the most childish way possible and proceeded to give her incredible wing-clipping blaster powers.
---
The stpory was fun to play but it's been the story in its most mediocre state ever.
---
LFG: LFM - Kralky boss - 250Li - need everyone (no Logans)
---
&gt;And why does it take so long to pick all that stuff up? Why can't we pick items instantly like in other collections (like it was with coins in silverwastes, that's just for an example). It doesn't add anything up, it just annoys, because there's a big possibility that mobs would notice you and sometimes instantly kill if you are lucky. Or you would have to wait to get out of the combat to move to another place. 
---
That's exactly the point - so you have to either be incredibly careful or kill the things wandering around.  It's the same reason there are mobs by most gathering nodes.
---
You also get Tequatl style weapons called Gift of Aurene
---
Still think Aurene’s revival was a bit rushed, also if Caithe somehow sacrificed herself for Aurene (like giving her life force to aurene) for her revival, the episode would be much more meaningful
---
Of course this is just my opinion, other than that everything else was perfect
---
MAKE SURE IT HAS GREAT COOLING. I can't stress this enough. 
---
That said, I had a 15" Lenovo Y50 and the cooling was terrible. I am now using a Dell Inspiron 15 7577 but that's a bit over budget.

---
Literally the first thing he did when he woke up was fly south to go murder Glint.
---
To be honest, the whole notion that the Elder Dragons were mindless beasts was pretty much debunked in Edge of Destiny novel, as well as the personal story. In both cases, we see the Elder Dragon reacting and plotting against a direct threat to them (Snaff and the Orders/Pact respectively). Though in the case of the personal story one can argue that "it's the minions doing the plotting", this can't be said for Kralkatorrik in Edge of Destiny where the narration has Kralkatorrik actively choosing what to brand and not, and where to send his minions.
---
&gt;Nonetheless, If it has something to do with the quantity or the purity of the magic then this will, sooner or later, also happen to Aurene unless she is some sort of catalyst or even absorbs the magic in its un-corrupted way.
---
The implication is that it won't happen. Kralkatorrik mentions that the magic is not in conflict within her, and calls her a "new breed" when his Torment says she's betraying her kind. Why this is so wasn't really covered - could be why a champion was needed as Glint stressed so much (despite us not really doing that much in the end).
---
&gt;Wasn’t Scarlet sort of sympathetic?
---
Not at all. 
---
Yes, she was driven crazy. She was a victim. But she wasn't sympathetic. She was a bitch from inception to end.
---
Kralkatorrik is a more sympathetic villain because we first hand witness his interpersonal moment with Aurene, we hear Kralkatorrik's regrets, fight his torment, and hear his lasting wishes.
---
Compare the final cinematics between the two. 
---
Scarlet: "Don't you want to hear why I did it? All this chaos and destruction?"  Braham: "Doesn't Matter!" Scarlet: "Tyria will bow to a new master!" *explosion*
---
Kralkatorrik: "Child of my child. I only hope you never have to kill what you love. Now, mortal, return my blood to my heart..."
---
With Scarlet, you press F to say good riddance to THE most annoying character in GW2.
---
With Kralkatorrik, you press F to pay respects.
---
See, the key difference here is that they made a lasting impression by humanizing Kralkatorrik in the end. The fact that this was the first time we heard him speak made the moment even more impactful. Kralkatorrik had more character development in 5 minutes than Scarlet ever did in her entire 2 year Living Story season.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
Sorry man.
---
What a ridiculous impute motives. 
---
First you're in the wrong fight, that's not about her being a lesbian but her being a figure for quota and nothing else, you know the black dude dying first cause we had to buy your sympathy with political views ( wich seems to work very well right now ). 
---
In fact you're not even defending the cause, it's even the opposite. If you want to defend them ask Anet/Netflix or whatever to develop lesbian figure instead of putting empty figure just to buy you.
---
The original story is writed around Destiny's Edge, Logan was one of these guy. They tried to kill an Elder Dragon for the first time, talked to Glint, also Logan is the reason why Snaff is dead, etc ...
---
The development of Logan is poor but it's far from the worst.
---
Now Answer me ? What is the most important thing about Marjory ?
---
Kralk still killed glint before he consumed any extra magic so....
---
That's an ugly backpiece tho
---
But she isn't present at all during the Epilogue, which implies that she had already left with the Olmakhan. If that's the case, then was there a time when she actually says her farewells? Rox does hint at this at the very beginning, when the party first lands in Dragonfall.
---
That is still punishing if you aren't on daily
---
This was really really helpful, thank you so much for the advice.
---
how?
---
Honestly, I think this was a subtle nod to Rytlock finally feeling closure with Destiny's Edge's encounter with Kralkatorrik. 
---
"No, you're needed elsewhere Logan - do that, we can handle this."
---
The laziest way would be to use winrar or something and split gw2.dat in smaller archives, say 5gb or whatever works for you. You'll end up with multiple files which will turn into one big file.
---
It would seem that it already has, as Rox does not join the rest of Dragon's Watch during the Epilogue.
---
Bubbles was called Steve since shortly after launch.  Iirc bone-boi wasn’t well known as Steve until just before HoT.
---
Think of Vlast. He was Glint's first scion, technically born way back in GW1 times. But even then, he proved to be raised poorly, making him cut off from the world and unable to find a champion.
---
&gt; Scion and champion must confront Kralkatorrik together
---
And again, look at how Kralk phrased that one line:
---
&gt; "I hope you never **have to** kill what you love."
---
It's possible that phrasing implies that he felt bound by fate and prophecy to kill Glint. He could have intentionally not told Glint all the details of his vision because he *needed her to not trust him and rebel.* She had to die, and though it pained Kralk to do it, it was part of his duty to save the world.
---
Elder Dragons fear nothing, not even death. And apparently, not even betraying those they love. Our big purple villain seems to have more in common with another popular big purple villain than we originally thought.
---
Probably. She's been with the Olmakhan pretty much full time since episode 2. She's not really been that involved on the Dragon's Watch side of things for a while. I'd have loved to get a good bye but we'll see how it all turns out.
---
It's not a backpiece, it's the eternal embers from the meta event.
---
I wish they'd add decoration scaling. The infernal facade is massive...
---
OP is probably looking for tips to look better as a medium armor main.
---
[deleted]
---
At this point only one Elder Dragon is active. We will need to handle Bubbles at some point. Expect Season 5 to be a bit like Season 2. A build up to the next big dragon problem.
---
Unless OP wanted to play Revenant, then they'll need HoT.
---
My hope is for #1 as well. Kind of a loose ends season before we launch the next massive Kralk-sized story. They said they might change old maps instead of adding new ones and, while I'm all for new areas, can you imagine what they could do now with some of these old areas? Kessex Hills no longer looking like shit. The Flame Legion lands looking more like the Fissure of Woe areas in Dragonfall. Proper massive-scale phasing of places like Orr (post Zhaitan the world looks less corrupted, risen enemies become elementals, dialogue changes, etc.). And then a general clean-up of some minor story threads. Where's Malyck?!
---
No it's a different collection each day, but they're all time-gated to one per day.
---
FYI, years ago I played GW2 with a AMD A6 8gb and 1tb hd 5400rpm. Yes, cooling is extreme important. Running both 1024x786 and external 1920x1200.
---
For new players, sure. But the sub allows spoilers after 28 days or something.
---
I'd say the contrary, we got textures, models, various assets.. getting something related would be easier to make, ergo..
---
Even if that's the case, they've swapped VAs for player characters before, one even in this patch, and they swapped the VA for Rox this season.  Swapping one for an NPC we haven't seen for years shouldn't be a big deal.  I think Anet either has no idea what they want to do with her, or they just don't want to do anything with her.
---
they wont sell much skyscale skins because many people wont bother unlocking it
---
yeah i didn't remember how the Lobby itself works so I wasn't going to comment on that aspect, but yes, like you said, the games indeed are matched from any/every server.
---
Last I heard was that her new job position will require her full attention (hopefully) at least for the time being. If she wants to share more it's up to her.
---
Actually, I've been looking for sources on what you said, but I couldn't find anything regarding looting asc trinkets in open world on the wiki. I have, however, found that these champion loot bags give exotic trinkets. Would you mind sharing where you got that info? (Sorry to put your word in doubt, but I find it hard to believe that something that must have happened a lot since PoF release - or even ls4e1 - to not be on the wiki by now)
---
this happened to me too; I was wondering if maybe I missed a mechanic or something ...
---
Awesome to have you! We old heads love new blood. If you ever need help never be afraid to ask map chat. Hope to see you in game one day too.
---
I think they just happen every 15mins or so when the meta isn't going, I've been afk at one while watching a movie and then doing the meta when it is up.
---
Welcome to this beast of a game friend :)
---
We'll eventually see him on /r/Justfuckmyshitup
---
yeah mike obrien is at my desk with a 12 gauge pointed right at my head send help
---
I felt like I was peeling an orange during the first instance. Not a huge fan of the beginning, but I did enjoy the episode as a whole.
---
agreed, looked like I was watching an anime, was pretty disappointed they went with the obvious, it's so sad when they remove the weight and meaning of a sacrifice. And some ppl here on reddit were saying "Anet said they won't bring her back". The rest of the episode with her talking with kralk and all were fine, still anime, but fine.
---
I'm really debating it. Yeah, it's kinda neat, but I already have the Griffon and skins for it I never use.
---

All of them are just as needless. Arbitrarily locking someone out of doing a collection is just as bad as arbitrarily stopping someone from raiding more than one day a week

&gt;having a antagonist who is evil just because he is evil is very boring
---
The thing is, they shouldn't be good or evil. They should just . . . *be*. Elder Dragons like a force of nature. They exist to bring balance to magic, and the destruction they cause is purely collateral. I would like them to a forest fire that burns things down to allow for new growth. I'm not a fan of having Elder Dragons exhibit emotions like fear or torment.
---
At this point, what is the difference between Elder Dragons and any other fantasy villain? I really liked the idea of us helping protect Elder Dragons from over zealous heroes once we understood their true purpose. I would has allowed for some really awesome anti-heroes that could have broken with the tired old fantasy villain tropes.

It's a May Miracle!

they probably love shonen or never ever watched a single anime in their lifes and are not tired of those kind of tropes

What's with everyone hating on Captain Marvel? It's a good movie.

WoW classic will be pretty niche, it has nothing that appeals to newer, more casual players and imo it's almost fully running on nostalgia.
---
I liked a ton vanilla WoW but I don't have the time I used to have back in highschool for games. I grew out of it and so did many people.
---
why exactly should i do that? That's the only thing timegating does, they create content, than they put timegating on it so you can only do the content in parts (separated by days) and it takes more time. Please elaborate why my analogy doesnt work.
---

They shouldn't have made Aurene talk. Her coming back is fine, but the writing for that sequence of events is just awful.
---
Everything else is cool as hell.
---
Gotcha, thanks. It’d be nice if the flight mechanics/controls were explained more ingame
---
I'm saying if you care so much about "realism" as more realistic system would be 
---
you get the eggs &gt; wait 24 hours from the time you get the eggs to do the next step
---
rather than
---
you get the eggs &gt; you wait until the next pre-determined daily reset to do the next step
---
The currenty system is the more complicated one, and it makes less sense from a realism perspective.
---
People who finished the collection 10 minutes before reset hatched the eggs in 10 minutes and people who finished 10 minutes after need to wait 24 hours for them to hatch. It should be a set time from the time you finish, not based on server reset.
---
But there shouldn't even be a timegate to begin with so it doesn't matter
---
 &gt; Gw2 has nothing special going on right now, the xpac has been delayed, we don't even know if there will be one and the lw can't really keep the playerbase active.
---
The xpac was never given a release date to begin with, what are you on with it being delayed?
---
And further, as someone that tried WoW for like a week and found it to be "meh" at best, I doubt Classic is going to threaten GW2 in any capacity. There were some recent "converts" from WoW that might go back to WoW Classic, but WoW has been bleeding players for many years and will continue to do so, and games like GW2 will be there to scoop them up.
---
Honestly, the new FFXIV expansion is probably more "dangerous" to GW2's future than WoW Classic considering both FFXIV and GW2 fight to scoop up WoW refugees, and even that's a stretch to call it "dangerous."
---
YES! I loved his original hairstyle, hope he grows it back to that one again. :D
---
Why would it "hurt" GW2 any more than any other game releasing? Or FFXIV's new expansion at the end of next month? Or anything else happening? GW2 players gonna keep GW2ing.
---
You're amazed that some people have a different view than you do? Yikes tbh
---
Downloading this-this is now my new ringtone

Well TIL, that's awesome!
---
That's what happens when gaming companies use all the best shady tactics in the book to get people to log in
---
No, comparing GW2 to WoW Classic is foolish. You can’t do it. Graphics alone, GW2 is miles ahead and mechanics are better compared to the old WoW. The newer generation won’t really care for it. They aren’t nostalgic when it comes to the older WoW. Only folks who would be into it are the older generation with their rose tinted classes.
---
I highly doubt it. I don't even expect WoW classic to hurt WoW. People are going to flock to it briefly for the nostalgia, or to see what they missed, realize that the graphics suck and the quality of life is not there, and quit. Others who persevere will eventually get bored that it will never expand upon what it is.

I got to 18 in the first zone of the Asura, doing full competion, but am unsure of where to go next. 
---
The neighbouring zone (I think it's for the leaf people) I had a way point in has very low level mobs. What would be a decent zone to go to at my level?
---
1. ppl do complain about that but there are ways around those timegates and 2 you're not working on something when you're waiting with your thumb up your ass
---
because you can buy gems with gold?

You will understand that 99% of her lines is about her relationship in a very caricatural way, wich is ridiculous and insulting. She's a political token.
---
You take Logan as a comparison and I disagree cause that's a terrible one in every way. But if that was an heterosexual relationship my statement would be the exact same.
---
I did 1 full run and a partial and ended up with 50 rare unid and about 150 blue and green unid.  The partial run I did I didnt open all the chests because of lack of keys because I was doing map completion and story.  I might have had some unid on my inventory beforehand so don't take it as completely gospel.
---
I don't believe so. I just don't think gw2 competes for the same players as wow. Maybe Tera, BnS or ffxiv.
---
WoW is just so janky and hardcore player-focused in my eyes that I can never get into it. Not saying its bad because obviously it's not, but the gameplay and aesthetics' are just too different from gw2 to be competing for the same type of players. Raiders might go over to WoW, but I don't think that's a big population in gw2.
---
The concern would be more towards the recently leaner workforce at arenanet that may result in slower content updates that may not be fast enough to keep players interested, I would think.
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK

Players will bitch and moan about timegates until the end of time but its a necessary evil to save players from themselves

Guardian is a strong jack of all trades. It has strong power, condition, and support output, just depending on how you want to build yourself.
---
As for big experiences: Shadow behemoth is probably a good thing to start with. Out of all the starter world bosses, it's personally the coolest looking.
---
It would seem odd that Glint and Vlast could speak, but not her. That may have not been your point though, rather the dialogue itself.

What region do you play on?
---
If you want some variety, you can absolutely head to a different area. The zones all have a very different flavour... but honestly, exploring is part of the joy of the game, so have fun!
---
Shit, that was me as well. Forgal didn't go to The Mists, he went to Valhalla.
---
Aight, so I've only truly played a Mesmer (some dabbling in other professions) and I adore it. It's a little complex in certain mods but it's so dynamic with leaps, stealth, blinks, etc. I feel so fluid when I play and I love the innate survivability. That's my short pitch anyways.
---
As for enjoying the game? I picked up the game right when it came out and I played it for a bit but I was trying to "complete" the game and/or do it the "right way" as I had a higher level buddy who was walking me through the "best" options (liberal use of quotation marks, I know). But I got bored so I stopped playing.
---
Recently, I had a random itch to start playing again, five years since my last log in and I got hooked. What I did this time was not worry about completion or meta or anything like that, but to just explore and do what I felt like doing in any given moment. Try out PvP for a few games? Sure. Wander around in a slightly higher level area and accidentally run into the Shatterer? Why not? Ignore doing vistas cause I usually hate jumping puzzles? Sure! Ignore crafting entirely because I didn't understand any of it? Absolutely! 
---
Ultimately, I did a bit of the story because it was good for leveling, but otherwise, it's boring AF to me. Basically, I'd encourage your friends to just go with impulse as to what looks appealing. Help them out as so much of this game is intensely confusing but let them do whatever they find fun.
---
Hope that helps.
---
That's one of my problems. I like heavy armor more, but I also like the fact that rangers can both heal, do dps and support with spirits, while warriors aren't as versatile. 
---
This is the main reason for my indecision, and why I am asking for more feedback that may help me tip the scales.
---
I think there will be a lot of people who will *try* WoW Classic - namely, people who never played it and have some sort of rose-colored ideal of what vanilla was (instead of the reality, which was a tedium-driven grindfest).
---
A lot of people are going to burn out shortly after hitting 60, because once you hit 60, there really isn't much to *do* if you're not raiding or trying to be this week's one person per server allowed to hit rank 14 in PVP.
---
Source: played vanilla pretty fucking hardcore, burnt out hard on Four Horsemen progression in Naxxramas/rank 11 in PVP and sold my account for $$$ so as to not drop out of college
---
Man, the anime you're referring to must be terrible.
---
&gt; if I want to burn myself out then let me
---
This but unironically 
---
I just want to finish this trash so I can quit the game for another 3 months 
---
It would be another story if the content itself was actually fun
---
Make an alt, finish tutorial, TP to bloodstone fen and complete map
---
1. It honestly depends on your preferred play style. Guardians, Warriors, Necromancers, Rangers, Mesmers are all pretty fun but quite different from each other in terms of play style.  
---
2. Depends on their previous gaming background. Maybe bring them to world boss trains, personal stories, dungeons, map completions if they don't grinding content.
---
Welcome and good choice !! 
---
Yeah this mmo has some of the best community.
---
And as far as the visual, the starting areas are beautiful, but as time went by, the art direction kept being more and more impressive. 
---
The latest areas (since even the first expansion) are completely breathtaking.
---
By far the most beautiful mmo even above technically advanced mmos like Black Desert.
---
NA dragonbrand
---
&gt; I would compare it not with captain marvel 
---
The idea is that basically at the end of captain marvel when the heroes were fucked Mar Vel removed her caffeine neck patch and the power that she had within her raised like 1000 fold, removing all stakes and tension while making her broken OP.
---
Now Aurene, just as we were losing, removed her own neck patch, and suddently can absorb all the magic, open portals inbetween realities and blast kralkatorik's entire wing clean off with one blast despite the fact that he has the power of 3 elder dragons and a god within him and all she has is the revive sickness debuff.
---
But yeah the other issues you mentioned about how horribly paced it is also apply.
---
Whats funny is that if you play all the episodes back to back she's dead for literally less than 5 minutes.
---
&gt;while this episode's epic part lasted from minute 4 to minute 14, after which we proceeded to, basically, kick aurene's demented grandfather, that fell off his wheelchair.
---
I laughed out loud while reading this.
---
I also love scrapper! Running gyros and med kit in WvW has been an absolute blast.
---
Woah, you can map complete BSF on like a level 2 character?  You don’t pull ranged aggro that one-shots you from across the map?
---
You scale to whatever level the zone is. It's quite different than almost any other game of it's type. There is some benefit from going to higher level areas but at this point it hardly matters. 
---
Basically, don't worry about level, just go to whatever area looks interesting. It won't make much of a difference.
---
Yeah then I can be spared from having to log in to this trash game for another 3 months. Now I have to log in every day for 5 days when I could be playing something else
---
Yah. Despite having invented teleportation the Asura still haven't figured out FaceTime so this is basically her being written out of the game. It needs some emotional buildup.
---
This should be an achievement.
---
I would love it if possible! Just getting back into the game after years and I'm low on cash atm :(
---
Yeah, but who cares, just respawn and go again. Not much hits you on a griffon
---
Yup. I'm the point person for those (along with a ton of assistance from various others).
---
I want to get back into the game, started in Beta and quit after an xpac came out... Just can't afford the new expansions so I stopped playing when I logged in one day and saw that everyone had a fucking MOUNT lol... game is good.
---
Of course it's not mandatory, video games in general aren't mandatory (unless you've signed into like some legal contract to play something xD). That being said, if you are going to play one then you're doing so for the sake of entertainment. It could be story/lore, exploration, overcoming challenges, ranking up, playing with friends, improving your character(s) in some way, loot, fashion, getting mounts/pets/followers, and so on. So for new content to come out after all this time waiting, just to have one of the major key features of it have empty artificial breaks in it designed to make you wait longer, just seems like counter-intuitive design. That's not entertaining or even slightly engaging, but yet it also puts pressure on you to try and rush through it so you don't get stuck waiting for even longer.
---
Something I really want to focus in on here is that artificial break part. Like something you've mentioned to others is, "working gradually towards your goals". That's perfectly fine, that's not what's the problem here. The problem with time gates is, you're not doing anything really. You're just waiting for an irl timer to hit #:00 so you can keep going. You're not farming mats to be able to craft something, you're not getting gold to afford to buy something, you're not progressing in the story to a point to have access to something, you're not improving yourself to be able to achieve something. You are just waiting in EMPTY BLANK time to have permission to continue and then wait again. It's just not fun.
---
Oh, very cool, thanks!  TIL
---
HAHAHAHA! Awesome! xD
---
Its purpose definitely was defending and maintaining the Dragonbrand. Which begs the question why it was doing that if Kralk created the Brand unintentionally and had no intention of harming us.
---
I don't understand all the hate for the collection tbh. Everyone whines that the patches and maps are dead after a few days. Now we have reasons to play longer, and people still moan. Can't win.
---
Joko left us too soon.

He was on screen for like 5 minutes and he already demonstrated more personallity than the entire cast.

it was released together with the Finale of the third season
---
Having patience? What am I, a sucker?
---
Yeah, it's like what we learned about in Path of Fire - the Elder Dragons are all screwed up because they hoard magic, Aurene's circulating and sharing it. Granted, that doesn't mean Kralk *wasn't* the Aurene of his time, maybe something went wrong, or maybe the world-savers of that time simply didn't know.

---
It's honestly disappointing that an Elite Spec's special weapon is hot garbage.
---
Yes, I am aware of that *possibility*. However as a possibility it has stood since LS3Ep1 at the latest so the latest release has not really revealed anything new in that regard.
---
well champ bags could always drop ascended weapon/armor chests since they were introduced, but the only chest that dropped ascended trinkets would be fractal encryption chests before now.
---
Is it a spoon spoiler then?
---
Because the previous episode was groundbreaking and I stand by that. It is still a good story on its own.
---
The writers lacking foresight and being unable to write themselves out of the (now) artificial drama made this episode suffer, because this episode hinges on the previous one.
---
The previous episode still has a great start, middle begining and groundbreaking climax. This one suffers because they were too lazy to find a way to progress the story without undoing said climax.
---
Because its possible MMORPG players play more than one MMORPG. There's always potential for some GW2 players to also be Wow fans and by virtue of Classic being released it could affect player counts for GW2
---
Great. Never getting these weapons then lol. Thanks for clearing it up.
---
5 days? Very annoying? Lmao this is why gaming communities are so shitty. Y'all have no patience, think you deserve everything right away, just so you can go and complain that the game isn't keeping your attention long enough. FFS
---
Both, but drop rate from skritt chests quite low. I had to open over 700 of them, before it droped for me.
---
My point exactly, I remember vividly what was the no.1 excitement back in those days, everybody hyped for what QoL and class fixes is gonna be added as well as new content. This will have none of that and no new content :'D Not even touching the fact that everything is very well known, guides everywhere and min-maxing for everything.
---
Guardians are pretty squishy if you don't know how to use their active defense skills well. Warriors can basically face tank a good chunk of things as long as you dodge the big telegraphed attacks. Reapers are unkillable unless you're trying to solo a legendary mob.
---
SSShHHHHHHHHH
---
Taking argument out of context and riddiculing it.
---
Yeah, average GW2 player here.
---
He also believed he was right, he wasn't just kicking puppies for the sake of kicking puppies.
---
Make sure for full story n stuff, you buy the S2, HoT, S3, PoF, and S4 content. It sounds like a lot but I cannot express how worth it it is. I didn’t have any of it, but then I got HoT and binge played everything up until ep5 S4 came out. Then I played ep6 yesterday. Holy Crap. This game is amazing.
---
What if I want to spend money?
---
Technically, all sylvari are grandchildren of Mordremoth, since the Pale Tree is supposed to be the Glint analogue to his Kralkatorrik.
---
I'm extremely annoyed by this because I have 27 spirit shards because all my spirit shards since I started have gone towards legendaries, and I need 200 for my bloodstone shard. All the exp from the events for achievements for the episode mastery is just being wasted. It's extremely frustrating, honestly.
---
These are the  extremely pricey pof vendor items too right
---
Did you read the first question in the comment you're replying to?
---
You are agressive and unprofessional. I don't want to talk to you, sorry. Maybe when you grow up we can come back to theorycrafting and story discussions. Enjoy your playtime :)
---
Praise Joko.
---
Yeah. Some are wonderful (chrono shield), some are cool toolkits (druid staff) and some are... pants.
---
I am actually one of those people and i was really excited, but now i think will just stick with Griffon for when i want to play in air.
---
Can't find source now, just heard it a while ago. Something about representation of asian cultures in the game and why human city has a big hole instead of one district.
---
That I know, but u/BearSeekSeekLest 's message said that these trinkets would, although rarely, drop from PoF champ bags, that's what I'm challenging here
---
There was a post about this last night and I checked her site and her public social media and she has had zero posts in 2 weeks. 
---
I don't know anything personal about her but I am hoping that she is just very busy or has something in real life that is very obviously is more important. Her Discord is wondering the same thing.
---
Right now all we can do is hope that she is okay and will be back with us soon.
---
Just imagine if you stopped being such a petty little shit about it
---
Yep, the story is filled to the brim with plot holes. This ep was actually laughably bad story telling.
---
"There's something in the water. Help!"
---
or perhaps
---
"The wall's down! Strike now, while it's stunned!"
---
Agreed. I'll do the rest. Just... ffs. Don't put a stopper on my own progress. If I wanna do an entire bucket of collections in one evening vs If I wanted to spread it out over a few days. People should be allowed to do both.
---
It's the only thing I was annoyed with in terms of this episode. That and the meta event interfering with story progress.
---
It is (still don't know if other can drop), but you can get one for "free" though PoF achievements
---
Yeah for celerity sake there are skills that are fun and not meta
---
&gt; This map appears to stretch the maximum boundaries of the engine's map size limit.
---
Wait what? It doesn't seem that massive. Elon Riverland the Desolation and Crystal desert seem bigger than it.

#GotTheMeats
---
I think he's refering to the core pof mounts vs the bettle and griffon.
---
This made me so happy to see, honestly I loved this game sense beta and having only seen hate on it for a while or complaints about meta really killed my love for it
---
But this is why I love the game, what this post says. From why they love mechanics to how the game naturally encourages you to work with others and how that has caused a community I love to foster.
---
That's literally what you did when you said 
---
"Wait, wait, wait... if you cannot progress Skyscale collections instantly, you cannot play the game? I mean - there is a whole new map in there!"
---
I was making fun of your strawman by also making a straw man. Thanks  for showing everyone you are indeed a fucking muppet.
---
I did. Guess I should have expanded more; Wow is different from other MMORPG's simply because it has been the biggest and theoretically shaped the MMORPG market to what it is today. Classic is different from other types of releases by virtue of it being classic.
---
He didn't say anything about Coalescence either; we all know that's going to be the raid exclusive Ring. Most people were under the assumption that LW3 concluded with Aurora, a brand new trinket collection designed for LW3 mastery - therefore LW4 should conclude with another brand new trinket collection for LW4 mastery. Completely unrelated to Coalescence.
---
I think if we were to see one it'll be at the end of LW5 and encompass both seasons, simply due to the fact they're both under the "PoF Living World" content umbrella.
---
Well I meant solo pve, group pve (map metas, bounties etc.) and possibly raids/fractals. 
---
I play very little PvP or WvW and when I do I will only play with professions I know through-and-through. So definitely not atm with warrior.

If you have paid time off, arrange it ahead of time (not calling off), and want to be first in, why not?  I took a long weekend for PoF because it didn't hurt me to do so.  Nothing wrong with structuring a "do whatever I want" day around a release.
---
AAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!
---
Best move name EVER.
---
Thank you so much for letting us take a bite out of this lovely dragon! He was delicious! :D
---
No clue why this’s getting downvoted. This story has no real sense of levity. It didn’t feel like HoT story where the pact was battling impossible odds in this extremely hostile foreign environment. Allies were actually severely hurt and one even PERMANENTLY killed. Ending was climactic, difficult boss fights, characters you liked could be brought in to fight with you giving closure to their story (esp with characters like braham).
---
 This story was literally, “oh we have an OP dragon that isn’t really an elder dragon but can shoot one down, absorb all of its power, and be fine”. If the story doesn’t end with aurene getting corrupted  from the mass amount of magical power and us having to kill her, this game’s narrative will make literally no sense. Because that’s what happened to every other dragon. New map and meta are quite good tho.
---
I was hoping to see this happen! A lot of extra keys floating around right now
---
I was so pleased to see a full set of trinkets in the new map. Compared to S3, S4 has been extremely limited with trinkets, which is annoying when you did want stats like Grieving. Especially because the Grieving vendor only has 2 Rings and 1 Accessory (Amulet from Mastery), meaning you had to use S4 maps to get the other accessory. I snagged the new accessory right away because new map currency is way easier, or at least more fun, than those Difluorite Crystals.
---
I doubt it. I think mainly hardcore players will go back to vanilla wow. Although, I could be wrong.
---
because we have the replacement for him this time. Aurene.  Balth just wanted to kill him, which would in turn mess with the All and balance of magic causing the death of Tyria.
---
&gt;and suddently can absorb all the magic
---
She could always absorb magic. I though that was clear by the fact that her egg absorbed Mordremoth magic, she absorbed some Balthazar magic, and Joko magic.
---
&gt;open portals inbetween realities
---
This was also established in the previous two episodes. She used that ability to go hide in a version of Glint's lair in the mists at the end of EP4 and used it to draw Kralk out of the Mists in EP5. Nothing new here.
---
&gt;and blast kralkatorik's entire wing clean off with one blast despite the fact that he has the power of 3 elder dragons and a god within him and all she has is the revive sickness debuff.
---
So, Aurene has to stay "depowered" due to her revive while Kralk randomly heals all his wounds from the last battle. I felt they addressed this well in a single line in that first instance: Kralk was hurt badly and still bleeding. He chose to try and flee instead of fight.
---
Also the short stories and EP6 imply that it was a period of days in between Aurene's death and revival. For the player it's only minutes, but that's implied by the fact that the player isn't at Thunderhead Keep at the beginning of the patch
---
holy crap how did i not know of this
---
She's probably gonna stick around in some way, especially since no one knew about the Olmakhan before and they're probably going to need a representative of sorts in world-wide matters and relations (she already handled this sort of thing after all). We might still hear her/from her, she just won't be in-action unless we really need Olmakhan support (hopefully for them, it'll be a long while before we do, let the poor survivor kitties take a rest).
---
As for Braham, I'm imagining she'll hold the thing off as much as possible and in the end he'll be the one to figure it out and tell her it's ok. He's grown quite a bit after all, this is his chance to show he's a big strong boy now and I don't see him go emo-angst again just for this.
---
He sacrificed himself to save us all
---
WE HAVE THE  MISTS
---
*dun dun dun dun*
---
It's almost like the character they've built up as a messianic archetype for the past four years followed a similar path through her story as Jesus did through his.
---
In game maps don't adhere to a consistent scale or ratio. Tyria isn't a series of box canyons. Terrain on the map is condensed or expanded to whatever best fits gameplay needs. It's the same way that Divinity's Reach isn't canonically 20 houses in an area that you can walk the diameter of in five minutes. That's just the way it appears in game because that's pretty much the only way it can appear in game. The maps are set pieces not geography accurate scale models of what they're meant to represent.
---
Thank very much, sounds worth exploring, if only for those new skins.
---
That’s what they *want* you to think, man.

I hope they do some map artwork touch-up.  add more random land masses and more shallow water color around the actual map so it blends in more nicely
---
Oh? Do we have a preview of those anywhere?
---
They should add more shallow water colors and random land masses on the map artwork so it doesn't look so... Square and not appropriate.
---
North to Brisban Wildlands through the portal up by the Thaumanova Reactor.
---
It's one of my favorite zones in central Tyria and provides a wide variety of enemies, valuable iron ore, several of the champion bandit bosses, a beetle race track, and broadly is very easy to navigate.
---
&gt; She could always absorb magic. I though that was clear by the fact that her egg absorbed Mordremoth magic, she absorbed some Balthazar magic, and Joko magic.
---
The issue isn't that she can absorb magic, the issue is that she can do it without consequences.
---
Kralkatorik was in endless pain and driven insane by having all magics in him, but aurene can do it consequence free.
---
&gt;This was also established in the previous two episodes. She used that ability to go hide in a version of Glint's lair in the mists at the end of EP4 and used it to draw Kralk out of the Mists in EP5. Nothing new here.
---
Not in such a grand scale with such a massive frequency.
---
&gt;So, Aurene has to stay "depowered" due to her revive while Kralk randomly heals all his wounds from the last battle. I felt they addressed this well in a single line in that first instance: Kralk was hurt badly and still bleeding. He chose to try and flee instead of fight.
---
​
---
The issue is that kralkatorik still has the power of 3 elder dragons in him, alongside the power of a literal god, while all aurene had was the revival sickness debuff.
---
When joko first used his revival ability he could barely walk and had to limp toward his throne before he was even able to stand up straight, but aurene is suddently blasting wings and traversing realities?
---
All it took for kralk to become so weak that a juvenile dragon could ground him was us poking at him with sharp sticks?
---
What stops a fully grown elder aurene from oneshoting the remaining dragons now?
---
While you're probably right, that's not necessarily true. It may mean that what we get has a different landscape from GW1. Or maybe we only saw a portion of the FoW in GW1
---
It literally shows in the video how it works,  im not fishing for views, video is not even monetized, your "enticement" is if YOU give a shit about it or not.
---
expecting no world eating dragons for at least the first episodes, but its just inevitable the story goes in the dragons/magic direction
---
the way anet has handled the sea dragon, i wouldnt be surprised if it was the "final boss" of the story in gw2. Build up the story leading to it in season5 and end with expansion 3. Hopefully it has more intelligence and actual plans rather than another world destroyer type
---
also taimi is getting the awakened treatment from joko i mean aurene, fuckin calling it
---
Is there any indication that bubbles is a significant problem, however?  Outside of being somewhat of a risk for people traveling by boat?
---
There are 5 collections filled with separate collections in them to complete it, each of those 5 are timegated (locked behind an artificial wait timer to begin the next one) -- and if you finish one of those 10 seconds after the Daily Login Chest pops up, then you have to wait a full 24 hours just to start the next one, and that's if you login early enough in the day to actually finish it before the Daily Reset happens again.
---
You get that with the onion rings.
---
Pointing out that a story isn’t that well done and filled with plot holes is diff than “negativity”. It’s called constructive criticism. Can you explain why kralk was a corrupted by the various Magics but when aurene absorbed them she was fine? Or how about how the story made it seem like kralk was only evil because of all this magic he coalesced, but he still killed and attacked the heroes before any other dragon died? Why did he randomly turn good? Or how about how he acting endearing towards his grandchild now, but before he coalesced all this energy and turned crazy, he killed glint without a thought? It’s just bad, inconsistent story telling. A net has done much better in the past, nothing wrong with holding them to a higher expectation.
---
He did push the Krait on us, and that's terrible.
---
yes this is the TL:DR, i just wanted to show and make clear that its not about quantity of how much shit you kill  since its on a CD.
---
Banana bread at work? Aw hall yeah
---
oohhh... well thats poop.
---
thanks for the clarification!
---
It'd be really interesting to see base maps get a significant world change, sorta like WoW's Cataclysm Expansion but instead of a mini-apocalyptic event it'd just be the world moving on and expanding into a new era. Make some of the more boring maps more interesting (I'm looking at you, Human areas).
---
Loot that has meaning but requires in-game work and returns a solid amount of gold. I would do a week's worth of work in-game to earn a 100g vendorable item vs 200g from junk collected over that same week.
---
Edit: Less junk and inventory management, more gameplay and stuff to work towards.
---
Thank you! 
---
Also, unrelated question - at what point should I buy the expansions (provided I am still enjoying the game)? At 80?
---
now you have something extra to do next to the world bosses and achive hunting
---
That was full on signaling glints death was apart of the whole plan.  Hell its now fair to speculate Logan being whisked away by Jennah may have actually been against his plan. The whole branded turning around may have legit been kralk now openly saying to leave them be.
---
Sure sure. But to use it as part of a complaint is a bit much.
---
Yeah but it doesn't have the strong art direction of gw2.
---
While BDO is a beautiful picture-like screenshot simulator,
---
Gw2 is a gorgeous artwork-like screenshot simulator
---
&gt;	I like to fast burst everyone with nice skills and good weapons
---
Thief
---
&gt;	A class that feels light but does many things 
---
Engi.
---
...
---
Well shit.
---
If you want both, go ele, mesmer, or firebrand.
---
I don't get it, where's the punishment?
---
Are you losing anything, or are you just not gaining anything? Are you saying you should gain something when you don't play?
---
It's just a time gate. A pretty short one at that. It's not forcing you to play a certain way - in fact you're given a LOT of flexibility as to which events you complete for this collection *and* they overlap with other rewards/goals too. You can complete this collection at your leisure, there is NOTHING available in the game which requires you own a skyscale to complete, and the only limitation is 4 daily resets after certain progression marks. 
---
I find time-gates super annoying too, but jesus you people are melodramatic.
---
About soo, but you would be better off doing some meta that has some kind of mini "horde" mode, dungeons come to mind, fractals?, Verdant Brink Camp Defense is good too.
---
check out action camera mode FOR SURE!!!
---
Dulfy is more than one person :)
---
No. Just... No 
---
Arby's slogan should be "Our meat meets the minimum federal guidelines required to label it as meat!"  So gross.
---
While I'd buy anything GW2 does out of principal, I'm super skeptical about an entire expansion dedicated to underwater content. It's the most boring setting idea I've heard, but it would be interesting to see if ArenaNet could find a way to make it interesting.
---
Also, god, even if we can't play as Tengu, I just want to get behind their wall. You just KNOW whatever the Tengu's home looks like, it is beautiful. Maybe they'll be kinda prophetic, and have been waiting for Aurene's ascension as part of some prophecy.
---
The day 2 collection is much better. Less hunty and more ‘go to this spot’ and *everything* related to the collection is labelled
---
omg gender so important
---
Regarding dragons being 'baddies':
---
We know that their attitudes didn't change with the release of magic. We have hard records of a previous war-for-survival from before the human era. So while the dissonance of magics within Kralkatorrik are definitely a new symptom, I posit that it's just a progression of a greater issue: that the Elder Dragons as they are *can't* rebalance their hoarded magic as Aurene can, and thus have been slowly worsening over the millennia. More, I believe that the reason Aurene is 'the first of her kind', the reason why a champion was necessary *at all*, was that the bond we shared quite literally *created* the ability to redistribute magic at will, rather than passively during hibernation after gorging to being full.
---
Face it: what did we, individually, contribute? The only thing, the *only* thing that we did that any other random individual with a blood-spear couldn't have done, was the channeling-blasts to free the branded magics during he final fight. And where did we get that power? Aurene.
---
This would also be supported by the apparent surprise Kralk had when he realized the multiple magics weren't at war within Aurene. He's been alive for thousands of years and he couldn't figure out how to keep his diet in check. Aurene's managed it in such a way that he's in awe?
---
As far as his last line... man I have ***NO*** idea and I am beyond psyched to learn more.
---
EDIT: Also, I'm still waiting for the world at large to realize "wait isn't the Pale Tree a dragon descendant/scion?" Not as in, "oh Sylvari are minions lol" but as in "Wait she could help be a magic redistributor as well because she's been purified through bonds made with Ronan and Ventari".
---
The new meta drops quite a bit of unidentified gear, it's looking pretty good right now. Haven't tested it out enough to figure out how much gold it is, but it's definitely there.
---
Also, 10g/hour is pretty decently fast for this game tbh, most things struggle to even hit that number
---
10g an hour is already more than what most of us started with xD  
---
Also for Dragonfall, we would have to run a study on what people get etc.
---
Well hopefully we can agree to disagree.
---
Only acceptable if it's deep fried. But if it IS deep fried, yeah, that's the traditional accompaniment sauce.
---
When he fell into the water during that cutscene my mind immediately went there. As in, Selbbub jumps out and eats him.
---
yeah some asshole told me that Jesus dies in the second season of the Bible :/
---
&gt; We also know that not all dragons are innately evil, but tormented by magics
---
I wonder who made it happen. Who killed Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Balthazar and caused Kralkatorrik being tormented by their magic? Oh wait!
---
Ah yes, the "lore" of completing the hearts again for the privilege of having the heart NPC be willing to sell to you so you can buy a piece of a druid runestone that they have no reason to even have.
---
More like a handshake
---
If you have enough sense to know you can look it up...then look it up.
---
I'd like to think we've rounded out the ED storyline pretty well though. The only one that is still remotely a problem is Bubbles, and I've no clue how much of a problem he is. It's pretty clear ArenaNet is running out of ideas to keep SUPER CATACLYSMIC EVENT THAT WILL END THE WORLD not cliche, and there's so much more they can do with the politics and social issues raised in Tyria that an elder dragon keeps ruining. Not to mention how we keep seeing areas that are scarred due to corruption -- it'd be nice to get untouched Tyrian landscapes to explore.
---
But, it could really go either way.
---
This game has the best world bosses of any MMO, period. I'm super excited for you :) I wish I could experience it all for the first time again
---
My suggestion would be to focus less on what's the best gold/hour and more on what you actually enjoy whether that be PvP/WvW, Dungeons/Fractals or Raids.
---
This sums it up pretty nicely
---
What did you just say about my EQ?? https://i.imgur.com/WQUFf5O.png
---
Ah i'm EU.
---
I'm so sick of y'all out here whining about this shit every time. OH MY GOD I HAVE TO WAIT 5 WHOLE DAYS WHY CAN'T I GET IT NOOOOOWWW MOOOOM PLEEEEASE.
---
When y'all graduate from school and get out in the real world you will understand there is actually much more to life than this game. Maybe some of you will even choose to engage with it.
---
JFC just imagine, this time ONE WEEK FROM NOW, y'all will have the mount and be completely over this bullshit tantrum, looking for the next thing to whine about, i.e. lack of content, game is dead etc.
---
Same... I even joked about it with a previous post. Would be so unexpected, especially for the in game characters
---
What he posted was not constructive criticism, lol. Don't be blind like that.
---
Do you feel like I need to defend the guildwars 2 staff's writing to you? If so, then that's a mistake on your part. 
---
You may not have enjoyed it, but hey you know what. I did. A lot actually. I thought it was an outstanding episode and finale. You can take the other guy by the hand and create a thread about whatever negative points you feel is valid, and take it from there. You're more than welcome, I don't care at all actually.
---
Calling what he wrote constructive criticism is hilariously dumb though. Constructive criticism is the process of offering valid and well-reasoned opinions about the work of others, usually involving both positive and negative comments, in a friendly manner rather than an oppositional one.
---
Thanks, Tybalt! Have and [apple cider]!
---
Ahh, that hit the spot.
---
Inb4 Krait are actually good but just corrupted by the evil released magics. Maybe they'll turn into the next playable race!
---
It's not bothering me, so please keep the questions coming! ;)
---
LFG simply advertises for and creates the group.  There is no teleportation involved, so if you want to go to the Ascalonian Catacombs you'll need to walk there.  Fortunately, it's not really that long a walk, the zone it's in is a newbie zone so you have access to a waypoint in it automatically, and then it's just a trek across half the zone.  Since you're over level 30 now, you can also walk there as a F2P player by using the central Asura Gate in Divinity's Reach to get to the hub city of Lion's Arch, using another Asura Gate there to get to the Charr capital Black Citadel, and then heading east from there.  F2P players aren't able to enter Lion's Arch until level 30 to try to limit potential spambot issues.
---
If you do use LFG, make sure you advertise yourself/your group as a newbie who wants to view cutscenes/is inexperienced.  The Story mode won't be too difficult for a group of players to get through.  The Explorable modes, on the other hand, will be harder content than anything else you've done so far, and chances are other max level players running it will be experienced and using various tricks and shenanigans to speed through the dungeon that you won't know of.  By advertising yourself as a new player, you'll ideally attract people who want to help you learn to your LFG listing rather than people who just want to plow through the dungeon as fast as they can without actually teaching you what's going on.
---
Just to elaborate on the difference between Story and Explorable, Story is just that, it gives the dungeon's story, which follows Logan and his former companions who were part of the guild Destiny's Edge.  That story will advance through all the dungeons to link back up eventually with the Personal Story.  Explorable modes are more difficult but have greater rewards, giving special currencies for each dungeon that can be redeemed for max level weapons and armour with unique skins, as well as decently large payouts of coin.
---
You know what, okay.
---
D/D burn ele. Signet of fire and restoration, Primordial stance, weave self. For traits take (in fire) blinding ashes, burning precision, and power overwhelming (in earth) serrated stones, strength of stone and written in stone. For the last one you could do weaver and go superior elements or elemental pursuit, weaver’s prowess,  and elements of rage.
---
Is this a good build? Not really. Is it fun? Oh ya. Burn all the things! Oh also take runes of Balthazar, and sinister gear. Sigil of smoldering and doom. BURN BURN BURRRRN!!!
---
Yeah what kind of maniac would want to get paid to not go to their shitty job and instead do something they enjoy
---
Joko really was a lot better than I thought he would be. I didn’t think I would like him.
---
Create artificial population for the new map. Devs know that with that the map is going to be full for 2 weeks.
---
The whole speaking to Aurene thing could come from Kralky simply admitting defeat. 
---
Kralky most likely understood that he was outmatched and at the end of his line so he decided to make Aurene his heir. Because he saw someone greater than him(Aurene coming back from dead, being capable of consuming different magics without developing mental issues, wounding him severely e.t.c.). 
---
The multiple personality disorder could be from hyper concentrated ingestion of different types of magics, instead of passive mixed from ley-lines.
---
The revelation would be that by eating from the ley lines, they drive themselves further and further insane and inflict pain upon themselves because different magical domains conflict with each other when within them.
---
Honestly...when they're on sale.
---
True, they're aimed at L80 and beyond, but the journey from L1-80 is basically the tutorial of the game, and it isn't going to take you very long. 
---
Think days, not weeks or months. If you're a binge type player you could very easily get to 80 in one weekend.
---
I highly suggest picking up both expansions. HoT adds a glider, which is of admittedly limited use now, but still gives you options even when in combat, and especially in maps with updrafts. PoF adds mounts, which totally revolutionize how you get from point A to point B, enter combat, explore, and think about your high level approach to the game. 
---
There's also the small matter of elite specializations, which is (along with mastery points) the post-L80 character progression. The vast majority of endgame builds take advantage of elite specs in some way.
---
Depends on what you watch. But if you stick to shonen i guess that would be the case.
---
Marjory's character has been mostly forgotten aside from the fact that she's in a relationship. The fact that she's a lesbian doesn't matter, she would've been bland even if she was straight.
---
Kasmeer seems to have more things going for her since she decided to follow us around for the PoF campaign.
---
Yep. Spoiled little children, they think all the content in the game is made just for them, and they deserve to have it all as soon as they want it. God forbid they find other things to do in their free time, instead of obsessing relentlessly over one hobby.
---
Im still not crying.
---
Unlocking the skyscale is a whole new level of F-quest. Not fetch...F. You tour around the map...repeatedly...just pressing F in a bunch of places. Time-gate, more F-quests. I was excited to unlock this mount, but now it feels like it's going to be a chore. I will be (very) behind because I refuse to drive myself to boredom flying around the maps pressing F for hours on end. I will follow guides when I feel like it, and maybe, someday in the distant future, I will have a skyscale of my own. I'd rather a gold-gate than a time-gate honestly. This is just daunting and un-fun.
---
This comment should definitely rank higher. My first time doing the lower levels world bosses completely blew my mind together with the leyline boss  outside lions arch
---
Yeah, true, though there are some painful parts like the Desert Highlands dwarven delve one..
---
Nice bow tie...very intimidating.
---
I was hoping that the deep sea dragon was gonna jump out of the water while Kralk was falling and eat him.
---
Focus is the defensive off-hand.  Dagger is the offensive off-hand.
---
Oh it's on a CD? How long?
---
I ran in her instance during A Star to Guide Us for the Elegy/Requiem Armor Research Team.
---
Its like a world boss worth of particles
---
As far as I'm aware, Dulfy hasn't had access to pre-release content for a very long time. The guides were made by multiple people giving Dulfy information to put together after release. So Dulfy being uncharacteristically quiet wouldn't be due to not having early access to content.
---
1. She's not.   
---
2. Who cares?
---
so chunks of god realms and an elder dragon corpse just fell into the sea......im sure old bubbles wont eat all of that.....nope....we good
---
Controversial? Maybe. But it's not aggressive, I am a gw2 player too in fact. It was an honest question, but I guess a lot of gw2 players are still weak minded and feel personally attached by everything
---
I'd say the point of a season finale is to wrap up that season. It can cliffhang or tease the next season, but it isn't a requirement. There were some subtle teasers for things that may be relevant in the coming season, but after spending multiple seasons and expansion on a plot, I think it makes sense to conclude it without setting up the next story right away. S5E1 should have plenty of time to introduce us to the next part of the story in the aftermath of S4.
---
wow that does look pretty good actually
---
The best thing I've done is Domain of Istan farming events, they were amazing and very interesting to me. However after a small break I heard they ruined gold farming in Domain of Istan so I do events only once per day.
---
boob god...sorry for bad English, not my native linguini
---
People said similar things about Old School Runescape, and yet it's doing significantly better than their main game in-terms of population and reception lol
---
We are Dulfy.  We are Legion.
---
Think about it in terms of raw geometry, there are more debris and trees and particle effects happening then on any of the other maps. While the actual size maybe a smaller, the number of polygons must be pushing  limits.
---
Maybe some of the HoT maps are comparable
---
wat about the norn tho? their mayor conflict is jormag and the svanir so i don't see what they can do with them without bringing jormag up.
---
and i think there's still things they can do with the EDs (just not mayor catalyst)
---
Never forget who brought you toys when you were little, Aurene.
---
Perhaps you should consider Guardian. It's heavy armor, and you can go power for decent DPS, but you can also spec into healing etc.
---
I agree it'd be better without, but it isn't a big issue.
---
PM me if you want someone to show ya around, or need a HP train when You get to Heart of thorns or Path of Fire. Love doing those.
---
"Nah, we good. Why don't you head back to DR to see if your girlfriend needs anything?"
---
You can always just set the squad as closed.
---
That said, invisible tags that are only visible to squad members would be alright, I think.
---
God one day y'all will grow up and get over this stupid bullshit. Just play the fucking game, or don't, if you even have anything else to do in your life
---
gold to gems
---
mark yourself as a target for the squad. or apple tag.
---
Focus is the offensive condi offhand.
---
It was not an asspull because of what happened. It was because of how it happened. Execution is everything.
---
I believe you can just set up a default squad for X/10 people.  Only reason to pop a commander tag is for 10+/50 people or for organizational purposes.
---
Either is perfectly fine, just find the play style you like
---
Both builds are viable, depending on what you're planning on doing, they just provide different skills.
---
🤔
---
Too much energy on display in one place to accurately represent guild halls, in my opinion. Although I appreciate it's probably difficult to capture a picture of seven flames scattered across three instances while one player walks to the guildhall nodes, silently mines them and then disappears.
---
I have considered it and even have one with both especs unlocked, but something about it didn't click with me. Maybe it's the whole "holy warrior" theme that I don't like.
---
Sold once, in a bundle with things you don't want.
---
On her website, she only has two guides pertaining to All or Nothing. And those two guides cover very little of All or Nothing.
---
She's Kristina Hunter. Her name is literally on her website.
---
Alright, that's pretty much what i expected. What's the benefit of running catacombs in the explorable mode? is there anything to gain that i wont quickly outlevel at this point anyways?
---
I am not saying it won’t have a big population in the beginning. People are used to the better graphics and the GW2 play style. The population will drop off fast. Like I mentioned not many people in GW2 have played early WoW and don’t feel the nostalgia. How is the bad graphics and how leveling up/weapon progression etc work going to hold their attention?
---
You'll for sure see less activity in most mmos during the first couple weeks of WoW classic launch. I'm only playing gw2 and other games until WoW classic comes out so I'm sure theres others like me.
---
"coming back to the game" The rewards have often been really boring/lacking greens and blues was a gw2 meme for a reason. 
---
I think they need to step it up add more than just mostly passive stats on items ect. Something akin to the gear/monster sets from ESO.
---
Adding housing would be nice for potential drops to add to your estate. 
---
New with the un-id gear in more places you're salvaging the blue green yellow stack lol
---
Aw man, that does not sound good at all, guess I don't bother playing scrapper in T4... Luckily didn't equip my scrapper so far. I really want to get started with T4 fractals but my herald isn't really welcome in most groups although my damage is not bad according to arcdps :( I play S/S + Staff, Shiro/Glint Power Herald (full bers) but it's really tough to find a group. 
---
I just want to play something easy and easily find some groups. I also have a fully asc. equipped warrior with marauder gear (Leg Hammer + Asc marauder gs) and a 2/3 finished reaper nec (100AR so far).
---
Should I stick with my herald, do something with my warrior or continue finishing my reaper? Or do something complete else like chrono? Do you have any advice for me? :)
---
The Effervescent Pods are massive and don't come in a pot. [They cling really nicely to walls, too](https://i.gyazo.com/e291bdfb3c420f550f8c660c57700a6d.jpg).

---
This actually points to my theory that yes, the Elder Dragons re a force of nature, but that they had been corrupted by the Human Gods upon their arrival on Tyria.
---
It was probably unintentional, but by the Gods arriving on Tyria, their magics tainted the 6 Elder dragons that already resided there.
---
Since Aurene became an Elder Dragon AFTER they abandoned Tyria, it would make sense as to why her magic hasn't been corrupted as well.
---
havent you read sondo's response? that is a correct comparison.
---
Maybe in some future arc, we get Bubbles come to feast on the remains of Kralk? If that made any sense (not sure if any magic is left there).
---
I heard that it was palawa joko. He said so himself, many times. ;)
---
Snargle was two Asura in a fursuit all along.
---
These bot commands are just too cute.
---
You will have a waypoint in each starting zone so you can actualyl explorer or meet up with friends.  For Sylvari you can join fun with the Great Jungle Wurm.  Bring your turret and watch for the red circles.
---
At level 52 it doesn't really matter, just explore the class and do what you find is fun.  There is nothing stopping you from doing both options as you want.
---
 With that said, for Fire/Arcane trait lines staff is better. If you had Air/Arcane then scepter is better, focus isn't that great for power builds in open world compared to dagger offhand (or warhorn)
---
Scepter/warhorn is amazing, one of the best ele builds and extremely fun to run around the world with.
---
They did. Some guy guessed the whole thing to perfection.
---
&gt;	please stop sending me DLC codes! please! I already got one! I thank you all so much
---
Aw hell yeh \😄/
---
HoT maps weren't as wide
---
Wrong.
---
In this case, it is, again, more like the kid shows up with her arms full of mice, and then tries to stab you to death with a knife she somehow already coated in your own blood from that time you cut yourself shaving. And refuses to stop even when you're like "Uh, what the fuck are you doing? Those are MICE! Holy shit put the knife down!"
---
And then she tries to shove an entire mouse into your ear (Snaff) and keeps trying to stab you. And you're like what the fucking fuck!?
---
If the kid gets killed in the scuffle here while dad's trying to defend himself, I mean...
---
AS FOR WHO IS MOTHER...
---
KINDA WONDERING IF IT'S THIS: https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Arachnia
---
But that's an unfair comparison. Players like him probably never buy gems with money and actually buy gems for gold.
---
Only thing the comparison shows is how badly the ratio for gems is and or how expensive ingame stuff is.

---
I like how it was a big thing that she branded Caithe last episode to get over her inability to speak only to be able to speak on her own a few minutes into the next episode.
---
I love 0 XP week!
---
link please?
---
&gt; through a Taimi Device
---
probably complained about Taimi ex machina then as well...
---
The way I see it is Aurene was introduced to different magic during her development. Even when she was in the egg, she absorbed Zhaitan's and Mordremoth's magic, and after the events of PoF she absorbed Balthazar's magic as well. Of course, she didn't absorb all of the magic from these sources and Kralkatorrik probably had the lion's share, but she still had access to all of the magic Kralk had.

So with that we can also explain why Aurene can open portals into the Mists; she gained the power from Balthazar as Kralkatorrik did. As for how Aurene was able to hurt Kralkatorrik the way she did, I think its due to Kralkatorrik's weakness against the resonance/blood/magic of his minions or offsprings, so it can be sprung that Aurene is a particularly dangerous foe for Kralkatorrik but maybe not in a fight against Deep Sea Dragon, Jormag or Primordus. This also explains why Kralkatorrik prioritizes killing Glint and Aurene over whatever he is doing.
---
With that said, I don't like how Aurene's resurrection was simply explained by her eating Joko and absorbing 'Joko's magic'. I mean, we are not given any information about how Joko is immortal, how 'Joko magic' works and as you said how Aurene is up and about without any 'resurrection sickness'. Hell, why can Aurene talk all of a sudden?

Hey. Hey. So. There IS one god-like/powerful entity in the very oldest Deep Lore. One that predates the human gods, one that was extremely super duper dead.
---
Incidentially, this being's bones were buried in Abaddon's realm. Y'know. The *God of Secrets*. And we've been doing a bunch with his successor, Kormir.

It's this thing:

"hey that's not a dragon"
---
1. elder dragons are already super weird fam; Moredremoth was literally the entire Maguuma jungle, not sure why spider-dragon is out of the realm of possiblity here
---
2. who even said the mother of dragons had to be a dragon at all when we're talking about ancient primordial creatures to whom we are but insects

I honestly like the old-school style of games that didn't have guides to do everything; she can take all the time she wants.
---
This is fine.
---
Having just finished HoT, I can absolutely confirm that Mordremoth had no redeeming qualities whatsoever and there was absolutely zero reason why you would feel anything other than animosity and/or fear toward him.
---
but you said no game spoilers

I re-organized this into a sorted imgur album so it's much easier to use:

Hmm, if OP is still crashing after updating their arcdps it might have to do with how Windows sometimes blocks downloaded files or folders with a "this file came from another computer" thing in the files' properties and needs to get the checkbox with "unblock" marked off to run without issues.
---
That's probably part of their charm; maybe it's too late to change it now!
---
I liked the reprise of the respective boss fight music for each of the magical aspects too. Certainly didn't expect to hear 'Here Be Dragons' again outside of the core story.
---
Too bad Mordremoth was able to attack the Pale Tree in the Grove.
---
Thank you. Tell her we miss her but to take care of herself first.
---
I'm assuming Jormag and Primordus will awaken. And Aurene will be no where to be found and we'll have to deal with them ourselves. I was kinda expecting that to be what PoF was. Wasn't expecting Balthazar to pop up out of no where so knowing Anet.. I dont really know they're kinda inconsistent with their story telling.
---
 Aurora borealis at this time of year at this time of day in this part of the country localized entirely within your dragon?
---
They're having alone time man, they thought the world was ending.  Let them have their fun.
---
I maintain that Joko Magic was the worst way to rez Aurene. As was doing it in the first damn instance.
---
But I can't stay mad for too long, because everything else about this patch exceeded my expectations.
---
I've always dreamt of being able to explore all the maps like this D; I even tried to find a program that could load the map files outside the game without success.
---
Eh, I don't read the final mission as Kralkatorrik being not evil. He's tormented by magic, which is why he longs for death, but he didn't show remorse for his actions as an Elder Dragon, only for trying to destroy reality. Really, he reaffirms his position as Elder Dragon in that mission, suggesting he is well aware of his actions, and what is required of him.
---
If you can contact her then you should pass on the message that somebody has hacked the [Cloake account](http://dulfy.net/author/cloake/) on dulfy.net and is posting spam.

Just had this happen to me, too. My character got stuck on their mount suddenly while in Dragonfall, and then I DCd. Can't log on to any character now.

that_shaman is Dulfy.

we need housing so badly

I hope for a more down to earth charr/norn season with a **completely new** cast of characters. no dragon's watch, no deus ex asura, no pact, no "we have all to work together to beat this threat" story.

Fair point.
---
Kralk was Yurie Lowenthal with a voice converter ^(^(/s))
---
I appreciate your response, though I have things to add and contradicting opinions. 
---
1. I do agree on that point. They were balancers in a world that had come to treat their existence as a part of an ecological cycle of balancing magic. However, it is still somewhat unclear whether that cycle has always existed. We just know they've been there for an incredibly long time, that they are interwoven with the all/the eternal alchemy, and that Tyria has come to depend on this cycle to such an extend that upsetting it risks the world's destruction. 
---
We originally took that to imply that the Elder Dragons are just cogs in a system that they support without being all too aware of it, and that this same ignorance prevents them from caring about mortals. Mordremoth has upset that notion and Kralkatorrik has upset it further: The Elder Dragons are very much aware of their purpose and are still caring creatures, but mortals, to them, are still insignificant in the greater scheme of things. They are very, very destructive, but not unnecessarily so. 
---
2. I do not think that this is entirely accurate. I'd like to believe it works like this: 
---
Elder Dragons are meant to be hungry for magic, but mostly for their own original domain(s) of magic. Kralk was mostly ever meant to consume crystal magic (or whatever his domain is). That in itself does not make them mad. They can grow very powerful and not be mad, which is the "natural state" for an Elder Dragon. 
---
They do not rise to rampage and release magic. They rise when they sense high magic levels in the world and decide it is time for them to feed on their domain(s) of magic. In sleeping, they bleed that magic back out, incredibly slowly, until the cycle begins anew. This is why Zhaitan had his minions gather magic, not release it. Dragons are not meant to rampage, they are meant to gather up magic in efficient ways, and mortals perceive that as "a rampage". 
---
The madness of Elder Dragons is tied to the interference of mortals who refused to give way and play their part in this cycle. When they (we) slew two Elder Dragons, the remaining dragons absorbed the excess magic, because absorbing magic is essentially tied to their metabolism, no matter the kind. 
---
But, as we now know, absorbing so much magic that was never meant for them makes them sick. This seems to be true for all living creatures, and dragons are no exception. Chak have a method of filtering out unwanted kinds of magic out of ley line energy; dragons, I believe, cannot do this, or at least much less efficiently. Mordremoth was already starting to go sick because we killed Zhaitan, feeding on pure ley line energy even though he was never specifically meant to. He seemed mostly okay with it, though.
---
The madness really started with Kralkatorrik absorbing the magic of TWO Elder Dragons AND a god. That was way too much to handle. Here is where "Kralkatorrik's Torment" comes in. 
---
Essentially, the "reasonable part" of Kralkatorrik already realised he was filled to the brim with magic. The reasonable part of Kralk knew about his own importance to the stability of the world. The reasonable part of Kralkatorrik never destroyed entirely without sense. 
---
And it was the reasonable Kralkatorrik that asked Glint to "prevent a world without him". Because he knew he was important to the world itself. It was not sheer self-preservation or lust for power, as we thought. 
---
Elder Dragons do not fear death. He merely wanted to ensure everything would still go according to plan. 
---
When Glint upset what Kralk thought to be the invitable order of things, he had to fight and kill her. He genuinely felt betrayed, but we can now add to this that /he genuinely thought he was doing the right thing for the world/. 
---
The "unreasonable part" of Kralkatorrik is Kralkatorrik's Torment. It exists as a consequence of /us/ having killed Zhaitan, Mordremoth, Balthazar, overfeeding the leylines or releasing the magic close to Kralk. 
---
"THIS IS YOUR FAULT!"
---
This part of Kralk does not care for balance or purpose anymore. It doesn't differentiate between proper and improper magics. It only cares for consumption and destruction. It is a once essential component of reality now seeking to destroy everything and drag itself down with it. 
---
This madness is why Kralkatorrik started consuming the Mists, even though the very process probably furthered his fracturedness, his suffering. It "stole his sense", as he said himself.
---
 He didn't do it to "more efficiently follow his natural purpose of consuming magic", which I assumed up to yesterday, but out of pain and madness. This is true rampage.  
---
Dragons don't actually enjoy being too powerful and diverse in magic, it is not meant to be. For a long time, we perceived Kralk as an extraordinary threat because he started consuming magic that was never supposed to be his. The issue is that we thought he himself doesn't care or differentiate. But the difference was very real, and it drove him insane. 
---
3. I figure this is the most logical argument we have right now. She is the granddaughter of the crystal dragon, but she absorbed different kinds of magic as she was formed inside the egg/ still very, very young - Zhaitan's, Mordremoth's. Later on, also Balthazar's. 
---
They never upset her organism, as it was "still forming around what it was given". 
---
In destroying Kralkatorrik's heart, Aurene absorbed more of those kinds of magic. Zhaitan. Mordremoth. Balthazar. Kralkatorrik.  None of these domains were detrimental to her, because she was used to them all. In being this multi-faceted, she is not as limited, and she is far less likely to go mad with power. 
---
In his final moments, Kralk realized how special she is. That her empathy with mortals has opened another way to her. That she can work alongside them, that she can absorb way more magic than him and immediately share it back into the world.
---
As he understood this, he decided to have faith in her, willingly giving her his heart. He realized it was too late for him to leave the known way of things, but that he could have. As an actually caring grandfather, he told her "I hope you never have to kill what you love". He is referring back to Glint, whom he had to kill because he thought there was no other way to preserve the world. Now that there apparently is another way, he hopes that this means Aurene won't have to repeat his mistakes. 
---
4. I guess this is indeed the reason why they don't fear death. They have lived an incredibly long life, and they do not fear death because it would mean an end. They simply defend their life because they are aware of their purpose as balancers and want to uphold it. 
---
Still, it was strange to hear Aurene say that "she doesn't fear death anymore". She apparently can resurrect whenever she dies, which I don't think is true for every Elder Dragon. I kind of wish that this didn't play a part in it, because it makes her "not being afraid of death" less meaningful than if she did not have that option anymore. 
---
That being said, Joko still died for good when his magic was absorbed, and so it seems likely that she would, too. 
---
5. Ascension was tied to that, yes, but Glint still mentioned it to Aurene and had a private talk with her about it. Apparently some things about Ascension are dragon-related or inherent to dragons. It might not apply directly to the Elder Dragon cycle, but I still hope that this is not a loose end and will be touched upon in the future. 
---
6. I do not think those two are related. Yes, Kralkatorrik is now (part) of Aurene, because she absorbed his magic, but that doesn't mean she gave birth to him. 
---
I very much believe his saying "Mother..." ties into the origin of Elder Dragons. If they have a sense of their purpose, that might mean that they were "brought up" to know these things. Somewhere, out there, may well be the mother of Kralkatorrik, former crystal Elder Dragon. 
---
And if we assume that Elder Dragons go mad even if they only absorb /their/ domains of magic for too long (which would make it a bit more complex, and I hope they don't roll with that, but they might), it might be that Kralkatorrik did not only kill Glint, but he also had to kill his insane mother and mantle her magic - a very, very, very long time ago.
---
yes I also use the same aesthetics choice of not having my laptop burning my house down
---
Funniest shit I've heard in a while. Props to the voice actor for taimi, 10/10 would give taimi cannons again
---
Ha. Memes aside, at least he didn't succeed in offing her unlike Kralk did with Glint.
---
There’s definitely a major technological divide when dealing with rural vs. urban, and I sometimes don’t consider that.
---
Yep, they picked up an egg.
---
another spawn is in wing's shadow, on the cliff next to the chaos gate poi
---
&gt; A DPS class doing that amount of DPS is something I rarely see, even for the most mediocre builds.
---
I think the person you are talking to (my guess) does mostly T1/2 fractals maybe even T3. Dps being that low is common for lower tier fractal groups. Players there have yet to learn/figure out or care about dps in a grp, they are still on the open world and solo player mentality.
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Muchas gracias.
---
So with this new piece of information we can calmly say not all dragons are douchebags. tied in with what we learned early on in season 4 and path of fire it seems like the elder dragons are actually heroes. They consume magic get bigger after they wake. Rinse and repeat the cycle long enough and it could affect the mentally like radiation does to the human mind. Although they do lose their magic when they sleep. what if the world is affected by too much magic buildup and that is why they have this ongoing cycle of hibernation. It would lead to a better excuse of them eating up the world and it's magic, then sleeping and then waking back up and eating all over again every thousand(s) years. 
---
If this is true then there is a point where dragons did not exist or they skipped a cycle. Reason why I'm saying this because of the human gods. They're just humans with a vast amount of magical energy. If the world produces that energy overtime during the hibernation of the dragons, could they absorb it to take their current place in the world?
---
I just started playing a few days ago too! About to hit 80 on my second free to play character soon. I was hooked to this game instantly, and this will most likely be my main game for a long ass time
---
Definitely gold. Since I can at least play the game and still feel like I am progressing.
---
https://i.redd.it/0f73p5sahlt21.png
---
Actually...no seems to be correct. All this time I thought Dulfy and that_shaman were the same person and, apparently, I have been wrong all this time.
---
I'll be in the corner.
---
Dulfy was Kralkatorrik.
---
Not with those gloves.
---
I got that one randomly while griffon flying through, I didn’t even see Zafirah just her voice lol.
---
The newest update introduced a timegated mount... and I tried so hard to grind through to get all I need to do the first days part, and I failed... 
---
I like most of things but time gated mount is definitely not one of them
---
Who are those last three?
---
 I eagerly anticipate the follow-up post when you first run into pocket raptors...
---
I just want an old fashioned Charr expansion in Blood Legion homelands. Not really interested in Cantha as I didn't play GW1 and don't really want another Human region.
---
There doesn't need to be a big threat either. It could be like Mists of Pandaria where you frolick around and solve some regional conflicts, maybe not at the scale of Elonians vs Awakened but at Nightmare Court or Inquest level.
---
They left long ago, much like the real six.
---
Bolt to the heart is better for groups that know what they're doing in terms of DPS. It only gets a benefit when enemies are &lt;50% life, so if it takes a while to reach 50%, it won't have much of an effect anyways. In those cases, you want to take fresh air instead
---
This is the worst experience in mmo ever...
---
I was trying so hard to get the egg collection done,  cause I didn’t want to fall behind... but I failed got stuck on 17 and it’s 4am here ... everything in vain... I hate this game now :(
---
Can't play what when you want? Do you lose access to GW2 or something?
---
It's a short time gate to continue progression. Want raid specific skins? Well you have to wait 1 week per attempt to get it or 6 weeks to get the currency to buy them. Want the Draconis Mons backpack? Two weeks of tedious steps and locked behind specific events. Want to work on elegy/requiem armor? Effective timegates via map resource (*though not anymore since you can buy it with VM now woo!*)
---
My point is this: Guild Wars 2 has had time gates for a long, long time. While it's true that this new thing can't be obtained if you decide to grind 20 hours in one day, there's no shortage of other stuff you can be doing to fill that time. Things which continue to progress your account's wealth / your characters.
---
In a week from now, are you going to care that it took you 4 days to unlock this new thing? In a month from now? Do you really think you're going to ever think back to it? 
---
Time-gates suck. They're annoying. They are just giant roadblocks in front of your face to say you can't do the next thing yet, or you can't repeat this thing for a chance at the same rewards yet. In a game where you literally have nothing else left to do but that new thing, it's just straight up a reason to stop playing until you can do it again. In GW2 it's just "okay guess I'll go do this other thing then"
---
Dragonbrand represent!
---
&gt;The dragons seem to, finally, not be a concern to the world anymore...
---
Bubbles: "Hold my beer..."
---
The Krait were around WAY before Bubbles awoke. They existed in EotN ;p
---
No mother its just the northern lights.
---
From the Situational Skills section:   
---
"With low group DPS and long phases (Fresh Air) might pull ahead of Bolt to the Heart."
---
If you don't think it's worth 5 days for the new mount then the solution is easy. Don't get the new mount. 
---
If you think it's that much inferior to the griffon, which has a completely different use by the way. Don't get the new mount.
---
No one is forcing you to get the new mount. You obviously think it's not worth the time so don't get it.
---
But man you have to remember that this new mount is technically given to us FOR FREE. At least to those who actually bought PoF and judt LOGGED IN.
---
He knows what he's doing, and he does it willingly. But he does what he does because he must, for the good of every living creature. He's not good, but not strictly evil either. He's not morally grey either. He did evil things for good reasons, which is kind of interesting. Hopefully they elaborate on the rational parts of Elder Dragons in the future.
---
That would be cool. Though I would really like to see us migrate closer to Cantha
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
You really let me remembered how i felt when i opened the game for the first time and played with my dad (I was 10 yo, and yes guys, i made level 80 with a full exotic set, wrongs stats on a ranger but an italian kid who love the wrong dungeon can’t be stopped to spam it).

---
Good for her. 
---
And if she's lucky ANet might change it to make it easier _before_ she starts then, based upon public feedback.
---
It's kind of implied that Abaddon gained his powers from Arachnia -- not canonically, I believe the only information about her is in the .dat file. I don't think this is the smoking gun -- I reckon Arachnia, if anything, may have been the god of the [Dryders](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dryder).
---
A well-tailored coat always looks sharp anywhere.
---
Well.. I thought the community was much better lol
---
Sounds like gw2 community has fallen too
---
I was simply trying to point out the fact that implementing time gated mounts is a poor decision, and in my case, for my play style, it gave me terrible experience. From what point did u concluded that I would be better off playing a trash p2w game?
---
I don't think cake a good analogy. Maybe something more like a model car, except you can only buy one part a day, and if you don't install the part you got before a deadline you have to wait another whole day.
---
Thank you SO much!
---
He's saying the same thing as i am as far as im concerned. Im arguing OP who says that timegating makes for more content which is just not true its just makes it so that people play the game for less time more times instead of once or twice for longer. So again i ask you why am i wrong?
---
Areee we even getting an expansion?
---
Jonanet... didn't I see you in the Aerodome last night?! I was rezzing the guy for my Skyscale. Small world. Also, I agree. Their curly fries.. whew!
---
Maybe Mordremoth just wasn't the best of dragons to begin with and that magic drove him "crazy" really quick because of it. We don't necessarily have to see conflict within, he could have succumbed to his darker impulses and just went ham. A zealot more than a tortured soul.
---
Maybe the Risen and Zhaitan did just hear meaningless noise. 24/7 static and white noise can drive you mad, and it doesn't necessarily take away capacity for intelligent thought and organization but it sure can make one angry. "Hearing" Zhaitan probably isn't a good thing for the individual psyche of the Risen either, being inside the brain of an all powerful magic obsessed dragon can't be good. Look at Scarlet.
---
I don't think manipulation is that far fetched personally, and we have seen many Gods and godlike beings go insane in world already, Abaddon wasn't the first or the last. We can't know and I admit it's a stretch to think Zhaitan wouldn't care about someone taking control of his minions but we also never see what Zhaitan does behind the scenes. What does seem mostly true is that EDs create minions to help gather magic so it is possible he just did that and never gave much thought. It could have been routine and boring by then for him.
---
Either way everything is probably a bit of a retcon by this point it's just about it mostly fitting :p
---
They're tactical pants. Do you really want the dookie piling up in your breeches while you're going to fight something as large as a mountain range?
---
I hooooope the next story has nothing to do with fighting a dragon and leads into the lore of another race, like the largos. And we get underwater updates. And maybe a huge underwater city. With new underwater legendaries and normal skins. Oooor Maybe queen Jennah gets kidnapped by someone far far away, like near a jade sea or something...
---
You also have a chance to get an "Gift of Aurene"-weapon box from then chests after the events. Those contain a complete new skinset (xxx of the scion) for weapons. They look like the standard ascended skin in a dark teal with a leyline effect and contain a Stars Sigil. ([http://puu.sh/DsJUI/df2df318fc.png](http://puu.sh/DsJUI/df2df318fc.png))
---
I think it's just jarring because it kind of felt like if your dog started talking. Aurene really didn't seem all that human until that moment. So much of our interactions and such with her felt like we were raising a pet.
---
...Dummy thicc, and nothing more.
---
(nice)

Here's what works for me. Maybe instead of invis elite skill, use Basilisk Venom for good CC. Depends on what I'm doing [https://imgur.com/a/WjG6E7U](https://imgur.com/a/WjG6E7U)  
---
Also for the deadeye traits, go all top traits. I had a few on middle traits for little squishy guys.
---
I assume you meant cantha? Path of fire is already in elona.
---
I said “passive” aggressive and it kind of is, look up the meaning. I’m not attached (or if u meant attacked) by everything. I’m not a snow flake, but I do believe that the question is stupid, however it is answered pretty seriously and very well by some of the comments. I think classic wow is the least of GW2’s problems. 
---
There are many things I don’t like about current GW2 that I loved in the original release. But there are also many that I do like. 
---
I’m also CONSTANTLY reminded by the PvP and WvW scene, in reddit, GW2 forums and map chat, that those parts of the game are broken or forgotten. Luckily I moved away from PvP and WvW long ago and replaced it with fractals and raids. Plus I became a more casual player. So yeah I don’t notice many issues. But I’m not denying that they exist. 
---
If the you (the OP) wish then you should leave GW2 and play WoW classic. Nothing wrong with that.
---
P.S. the above message is written in passive aggressive tone...
---
I think you're missing the point here. The picture is showcasing the quality of all the pieces at once, and given charr's history of individual pieces clipping with their bodies, this set is a great base to work from.
---
Next Class: Fashion Leader
---
This class focus mainly on Conditions such as: Blind, Bleeding and Confusion
---
They did say next season they don't want to force themselves to do a whole new map every patch, and if adding a new area to an existing map makes more sense for the story they'll do it. 
---
Originally i thought the new map every patch was amazing, but now i get the achievements and don't really go back to them much. Dragonfall i probably will though, since they designed the AP to make you stick around much longer (which is a good thing IMO).
---
There's no need to WP, unless that's just what you want to do; the path circles the whole map. Depending on your loading times, it's probably faster to just complete the circuit on your Beetle.
---
Taimi - Jimmy Neutron ;)
---
Thats the same analogy except i said 6 and 10 while you say 1 and N number of slices. While OP argues that it makes for more content. Portion control doesnt make for more substance it just decides when you can consume.
---
As long as she's in good health :)
---
I see the pattern at last!
---
That's what I hoped too but the fact that they didn't do anything in this episode to hint at it makes me skeptical. I guess if the pact leaves some people at the outpost on Dragonfall, they could start the next episode with you getting a message about weird readings/activity nearby, and you could take an airship to an instance of Dragonfall (like the start of this episode) before moving on to the new map?
---
I mostly was referring to how we cant even see the edge of the wing as we get pushed back as soon as we get near it.
---
I don't want him reviving Joko. I want him recruiting the players on the third Halloween 'Story', send them to what's left of the Underworld, find Joko's spirit, and bring him kicking and screaming into his Mad Realm to be trapped there with him forever.
---
Then every year we'll have 3 Halloween Factions:  The Mad King, the Bloody Prince, and Joko. 
---
And we could have the appearance of WvW NPCs replaced with Lunatic Courtiers, Bloody Rebels and Joko Loyalists.
---
I dont know if this still works but if you or someone of your friends has a Catmander Tag and someone else has not, the one with the Catmander can open the squad and give the Squadleader to someone without the Catmander. That way you can have a 50 man squad with a invisible Tag.
---
Lots of people don't know about this, the game doesn't draw your attention to it. You have to dig into the settings to find it. Iirc it was built by one person at Arenanet as a side project. (And I'm so glad they did, I don't think I could play without it)
---
A few other things off the top of my head that are not very obvious:
---
\- you can right-click -&gt; 'open all' on a stack of bags, also right-click -&gt; 'salvage all' on a salvage kit (might not be necessary at level 15 yet but will come in handy once you start doing things that drop a lot of loot)
---
\- in your inventory, click the gear icon -&gt; 'deposit all' to deposit all of your crafting materials and make some space in your inventory. You can access your material storage at any banker NPC in cities and a few other places throughout the world (in Caledon Forest there is a banker at the Mabon Market), and also at crafting stations.
---
\- shift-click on an item to copy a chat link into the chat, other people can use that link to view an item's details.
---
\- the /wiki chat command opens the gw2 wiki in your browser. You can add text after the command to use as a search term on the wiki, or a chat link to go directly to the page for that item (if there is one)
---
\- you can change utility skills by right-clicking the skill, not only with the little (easy to miss) arrow

Welcome to the game, I have come and gone from GW2 a few times but it's definitely a great community and it's in a really good place right now I feel. Enjoy yourself and make sure to always be having fun!

If you can afford it, right now. It's currently on a major sale and you can get PoF for $15 and add HoT at checkout for $10. 
---
If you're not sure if you want to keep playing and buy the expansions yet, they'll go on sale again eventually and it's not too bad to buy them full price, but I think this is \~50% off, so it's a good deal. 
---
The vast majority of expansion content is only for level 80 characters, though, so you won't use it until level 80. The only things that could be useful before then are the lifted chat and trading post restrictions.
---
Correct. It's helpful knowing that they exist, since some are still useful, but mostly they are underpowered and thus forgotten and unused.
---
Useful ones to know:
---
* blast + fire = might to nearby players
---
* blast + smoke = stealth to nearby players
---
* blast + water = healing to nearby players
---
* leap + smoke = stealth to self

Ah man. I loved that part of the map. I did it with friends and we were running around looking for the runes and yelling at each other when we stepped on a trap. It is one of my favorite memories of this game.
---

---
Coffers are not daily. Did the meta 2 times with the same char today and yesterday
---
Same for my gf and me. We are leveling so slow I feel like we won’t need the dlc for a long ass time. Damn jumpin puzzles keep getting us hooked...
---
You are mistaken about pvp lobby being bound to server.  Gw2 has concept of megaservers. So all servers are merged together and when population crosses certain threshold, new instance is made for more incoming players. PvP lobby is usually sufficiently populated you either went during morning of server time, or it is due to the new content released recently. Avg PvP queue is around 2-3 min.

[You don't need a lot of dialog to get pure gold.](https://youtu.be/Pj6iDczCDOI?t=9)
---
All we needed is a couple of one-liners when the commander nd the NPC see each other, and it can be reused over and over whenever the NPC doesn't have dialog, but still acknowledges the NPC so the interaction doesn't feel empty.
---
Nice. I hope it stays that way.
---
**FOR KRAIT JUSTICE!**
---
Honestly its nice to see new people get into the game - i have had for a long time but can never really get into it. 
---
I level to 80 then get bored and have no idea what to do. If someone could point me in the right direction that would great.
---
Ok thank you both
---
My money is on the first episode of LS5 taking us to the Blood Legion Homelands.  Kralkatorrik's final words hint at something that no one has ever really considered before: that elder dragons are *from* somewhere.  Before now, it's been taken for granted that the dragons are as much a natural part of Tyria as the ground we walk on, but now we have reason to believe there's more to it than that.  What better place to start an investigation like that, than the original resting place of the dragon who raised the question in the first place?
---
I suspect the overall tenor of the next season is going to be more political than previous seasons though. For one, the sudden appearance of a brand new elder dragon (I mean, that display had to have been seen all across Tyria, right?) will have people shaken up, and many people aren't likely to trust that this one is somehow okay.  That kind of major world event is bound to destabilize things, but perhaps even more than that, the lack of an immediate global threat likely means one thing: the nations of the world can now go back to fighting each other.
---
There's lots of potential for political intrigue in the next season. As Zaeim noted, there's a major power vacuum in Elona now, and it's going to take a lot of effort to de-program the population from Joko's propaganda. With the Flame Legion weakened, and human society being significantly disturbed by the reappearance of the White Mantle, and siege of Lake Doric, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Blood Legion Imperator try to restart the Charr-Human conflict.   There could be a radical splinter group within the Pact that doesn't trust Aurene, and secretly plots against her.  The Foefire is still a thing.
---
So, I suspect that Season 5 takes a step back from fighting Elder Dragons for a bit, and instead focuses more on the political fallout that's had to have resulted due to the events of LS3, PoF, and LS4, all with a backdrop of the commander conducting an investigation into the true origins of the elder dragons.
---
I mean, know them, but if you miss landing your whirl finisher in a fire field, it's not the end of the world
---
They help increase damage and efficiency, so if you can aim for one, by all means, do so. In a fractal or a raid though, there could be so much stuff going on that it's easy to miss a field
---
First of all it's not just dlc it's an expansion. Usually a new armor skin can also be considered dlc.
---
I guess you can say she covers it All or Nothing
---
You're giving them too much credit...
---
Other than the cop out start we all saw a mile away, and the [horror that is the mount collection](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bosdvr/the_skyscale_experience/) it's not bad, but that collection soured me on it and I logged out at that moment and am not sure when I'll be back. 
---
It's nice for something in this day and age to not end in a cliffhanger though. Appreciate that.
---
Where the Jade Sea has 'melted', ALL of Cantha is under water (except for the tops of that convoluted Kaineng City), and we get underwater mounted combat, because.... **WE NEED SHARKS WITH LASERS ON THEIR HEADS!** \o/
---
If they would just remove the arbitrary collection timegating, then it would be perfect. I'm fine with timegating. But some things just shouldn't be gated behind resets
---
Pm me this please?
---
Yet another Necrozma form.
---
I like the cut of your jib. I can already tell you’ll fit in perfectly with this community.
---
If you need any help or company in game, feel free to pm me. Always happy to help out and make new friends.
---
&gt; This community man I swear to the six gods
---
FTFY
---
You live in a weird bubble. Everyone else doesn't care about experience. Including fringe cases like being low on spirit shards.
---
I understand, but i guess i got used to it. Played warframe from time to time and time gated stuff is usual thing unless you want to dump plat to speed things up.
---
Not quite. There's plenty more like Janthir Bay, the Far Shiverpeaks, and literally everything east of Elona and Ascalon.
---
At least they're easier to grind for than the Tequatl ones.
---
oh........my..........funny thing is I haven't seen it yet!  I just got to the Melandru part this morning.  I did talk to the NPC's in the landing areas and heard them talking about the portals to these areas, so I was hoping I might see something.  Guess I will!

Congrats on not reading anything except what you don't care about.

Welcome to Tyria, Commander! Aw hell yeh!!

getting the same issue and arc is working for everyone else
---
Welcome to the best MMO that has ever breathed life into the fantasy world.
---
Huh ??? you mean ["That's all folks"](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/looneytunes/images/e/e1/All.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150313020828) ?
---
Gunna reiterate what I said on the forums.
---
People can call me "entitled" if they want but, unlike seemingly a lot of time-gate supporters, I am an adult that work full time 50 hours a week, I have adult responsibilities and have to juggle some semblance of a family/social life like most average people. So I maybe get a few hours of free time a night if that (and I cant always waste them on GW2).
---
Now I 'love' dragons. They are my favorite mythological creature, so I was more than hyped when we learned we were getting a dragon mount. Anet kept shoving it in our faces and such. When the patch hit I was ready to jump in and start earning it. I figured there'd be a big collection (and boy was I not wrong, maybe its just me getting old but man is the collection absurdly long and boring.) but I was willing to slowly grind through it in the few precious hours of free time I had.
---
The timegate has killed any hype I had for the mount sadly, knowing that even if I maximize my play time, it would probably take over a month to get this thing. Im not a college student or a young adult/teen working partime that has multiple days off a week that you can play 9+ hours a day non stop back to back. And knowing that something I could slowly grind out over say a week, will actually take me weeks if not months due to timegates, kinda killed my hype. After finishing the story I dont actually really have any desire to log back in. Im just kinda worn out.
---
But I'm just rambling and just wanted a place to speak my mind/vent. Im sure people will just call me entitled, tell me Im doing things wrong or how I shouldnt feel X way. But hey. It's w/e.
---
sincerely
---
A worn out norn
---
We just need the return to the rise of the Moletariate.
---
It can be done either way. For me it's just easier to WP, so either method is fine. :) You could very well circle it clockwise or counter clockwise. This is just how I do it.
---
But they are treating the story like a single player RPG? I get it budget wise they have to apend it on alot more then just story but the writing, plot twists, dialog, its all just like any other single player RPG
---
And tbh, it didn't feel out of place. When joko won, he got eaten. If I'm gonna be honest, i would eye roll whenever aurene showed up, but at that moment i just sat there, jaw agape.
---
wut?
---
I got the Harrier ring from opening a champ bag from the Meta too
---
I think the Mother is Tyria, the All-dragon if you like.
---
That's a lifehack, not a fix.
---
I ideally, It'd be easier to have a bit more control when it comes to squad tags:
---
* Blocking a player would hide their tag on the map.
---
* Blocking a player would prevent them from joining your squad.
---
 * These two options would be even better if there was an alternate temporary block that only lasts until the next login for when you just want to hide someone just this time without adding people in your blocked list.
---
* Squads would have setting to limit who can see the tag, 
---
 * Tag hidden
---
 * Guild members
---
 * Friends
---
 * Only people in close proximity
---
 * Anyone.
---
* and a better setting to choose who can join the squad without invitation: 
---
 * Commander invite only
---
 * Only people already in the map.
---
Dibs on me being Kormir! Easiest job in the world.
---
Dyes —&gt; Switch to Dye Mounts —&gt; Dye to your hearts content!
---
Yes, there's a cave under kralk with a skyscale scale that is closed off at a certain point in the meta (the same one you go into for story to test the spear).
---
Did they change how the bunny mount works? There wasn't anything in the patch notes about that. I haven't noticed any changes, either
---
Glad you are having a good time. I’ve just back into it and having a blast. Debating whether to upgrade for the expansions!
---
Enjoy the journey. I've played semi sporadically since it came out. Some really great times in there.
---
He looks like he just got his favourite Nintendo Switch™ game.
---
It was a great resolution.
---
Now we just need Logan and Zojja to have a heart to... heart... oh. Ooooh...
---
oh you mean the things that should have been in the game all this time?
---
i was talking about this with some guildies in our discord, actually!! i'll link some screenshots instead of copy+pasting
---
TL;DR: i think that there was something before the elder dragons, and that they must have had a "childhood" or some sorts just like aurene had. the only thing i can think of that came before them would be The All (probably the same thing as the eternal alchemy, which the commander themself saw in LW2)

It’s not an unpopular opinion, the people with this opinion are just out playing the game at a gradual pace in there spare time, instead of grinding and complaining on reddit.
---
I know, it's the underscore in my name.. understandable that people get confused about it!
---
Hell I even thought I was woodenpotatoes for 3 days straight after I had a theory about Balthazar being two Skritt in an overcoat!
---
(I still love you though)
---
The story was very feel-good in the end. Everything worked out. It cancelled all the drama created by episode 5. Too much winning can be boring. Anyone who plays this a year from now will have no emotions for the situation. However, I like the map and the meta events very much so far and that's honestly what matters more to me. I still liked the ending but I haven't received any insight into what's next. If I recall there should be more to Glint's legacy than what we saw..
---
This is the first part of the collection, you will have to do the full collection to unlock the Skyscale, still working on the other guides.
---
I honestly did not read that far lol.
---
I think they mean more like ls2 in concept, with all the cool stuff they've added in more recent installments.
---
What about Bog Otter?
---
TBH, his position looked photoshopped in too.
---
No you need to expansions. You can unlock them but thats it.

I rather pay 250 Gold than this feelsbadman.
---
I wonder if we will use Aurene to try to negotiate with bubbles.
---
Mounts help a lot with this. I remember exploring Draconis Mons without the thermal tube mastery (my alt doesn't have access to it) and just getting from point A to point B was an unfun experience.
---
A thought on how quickly Aurene came back: from a narrative perspective her dying then un-dying is technically a single event (the "death and rebirth," or whatever you want to call it, as outlined in the Hero's Journey), so it makes sense for it to happen fairly quickly. The issues, in my observation, are that A) we only see the event from an external perspective (imagine, if you will, the "God of Hammers" scene from Thor: Ragnrarok with the Odin bits edited out - the result is a lot less impactful), and B) the beginning and end of the even are, from our perspective, stretched five months apart, whereas in-universe the timeframe is much more condensed. If you look at Episodes 5 and 6 as parts 1 and 2 of one big mega-episode, everything flows much better. We shouldn't *need* to do that for the narrative to make sense, but it is what it is.
---
Abbadon was destroyed prior to gw2? I don't know if the intention was that Kormir absorbed all of it or just what she could contain but that's an example of some power that needed somewhere to go.
---
Yeah i started dancing.... just to see if i could
---
I have several diviner pieces on my chrono (raid support) and it works amazingly for solo play with self-buffing traits like phantasmal fury/haste and persistence of memory. I can maintain 25 might, fury, and quickness on myself in extended fights, and easily support others in meta events if I choose to.
---
Norn spirits/gods would be a very interesting antagonist. Maybe since they don't have to worry about Jormag as much anymore some dispute will come of it.
---
We carry on the burden till she comes back. It was actually surprising how quickly a full collection  guide was formed (and keeps expanding each day) since everyone just posted new locations on reddit non-stop. I bet Dulfy would be proud of the community.
---
I mean to be fair, i dont read patch notes to be reminded what happened in last one?
---
I share this sentiment.  I've played a number of MMOs and Guildwars 2 ticks almost all the boxes for me.  Great story, lovely scenery, more interesting mechanics vs skill rotation, works solo and in groups, not too much grind or travel time, endgame doesn't feel overly repetitive, nice looking characters and gear, fun mini games/activities/events when I don't feel like doing anything hard mode, and community is the least toxic of the MMOs I've played.
---
Someone can tell me where the Champion Abyssal boss spawns?
---
"Victoriously flee for our lives, I think he means!"
---
Those would have to be some extremely tall skritt!
---
Well how about use your brain and ask others to ping kp when you join?  Seriously.  Also, Core BS uses that sigil on maces so you clearly don't know what you're talking about even if that person was a dumb twat.
---
Why? if you open patchnotes for release of new story content, you should expect spoilers, moron
---
You are not getting reminded, you are being told the basic outline of the current story.
---
Actually, if you do some of the events in the new map, you'll find out who that ancestor is. They make an appearance. I do not believe it has any connection to the next chapter, but who knows!
---
went back to the instance to check and no he didn't the magics being in harmony was said pre fight and the first of her kind comment was after the fight so there's no reason to assume aurene is the first of her kind because she can hold multiple magics inside her
---
And now imagine that up to level 80 you will play in the oldest and ugliest zones, later it's whole new level:-P
---
Wellcome to the comminity!
---
If you are on EU and ever want a tour thru the lovley jumping puzzles of Tyria, just ask a PINKie
---
Im no mod, but please include my best wishes too.
---
If you're trying to make it for fractals you should use the SC build but make sure to swap gear if you don't have Spotter (a druid) so you can crit cap.
---
i sincerely hope the constant whinging about this isn't gonna turn it into a meme.
---
and yes, ppl are bringing it up constantly but most ppl don't care since it's been 4 months
---
I think it was an overall pacing issue with the season. The arc that got resolved this episode deserved 6 episodes to play out, not 3, but they shoved the Joko stuff in, which also deserved at least 4 episodes.
---
It's actually pretty bad as an asura.
---
Our walk isn't really a solemn walk, it's more like a peppy little jaunt. It felt so out of place that I had to swing the camera around to look at my face, too, and... my face has a ridiculous huge smile on it, as several of the asura faces do.
---
My commander's "solemn" walk down to Aurene looked more like the opening verse of "Stayin' Alive" should have been playing as he swaggered down past the grieving soldiers.
---
You're acting as if you read some Avengers Endgame infographic before the movie and mad because you didn't watch Infinity War and complain about spoilers. That's the level of cretinism you express here :)
---
Oof thats nice of you to call me that isnt it. But its ok once your ball drops you will be fine. Also you dont expect everythign to be told from scratch. Just say something less direct like After a loss during a fight with Kralkatorik you know
---
I also dont like the potrayal of Eir at all. In the novels she was different, and you can say the kralkatorik fight changed her but if you played gw1 you would understand what I mean. The potrayal of Norns and especially Asura in Gw2 is a joke compared to GW1. Asura were acctually ugly and were supposed to look ugly like little rats who were super obnoxious, annoying  (not cute, fluffy or any of that bs) but genius. Asuras in gw2 are all just cutsy little geniuses except in the personal story where rhey nailed them personaliry wise but the looks were always off. Phlunt is the best example of a real asura from GW1, and Arkk in fractals. They dont care about the damage they do in their experiments, they are assholes and dont value human lives at all. Here’s a perfect example https://youtu.be/MMGr-avzxaU
---
Its just sad that norns in gw2 are bassicly bigger humans since they have nothing else that distinguishes them from humans anymore except for their looks. I mean braham doesnt even transform in rhe story and Norn in the lore are supposedly the strongest when they are in their bear form. I understand why it doesnt work for PC but for an NPC not so much
---
Doesn't seem to be the case. GW2 is the only thing having any issues at the moment.
---
As I said the mouse didn't seem to be the issue.
---
Oof yourself, punk :)
---
why didnt you vote to kick him?
---
Its already a meme tho
---
Burn me, it's a timbit!
---
I think we are done with Elona. The only other area we have left of Elona is basically the realm of torment, which anet should not do.
---
In the most recent story, Logan was advised that an ancestor wants to speak with him. My immediate thought was Keiran Thackeray from GW1 EotN expansion, and I got super stoked just thinking about it. And it could be done pretty easily given spirits are a very common thing around Ascalon.
---
I think it'd be cool to see the spirit of Gwen,  Keiran, Pyre Fierceshot, Vekk etc, while visiting those maps that have remained blurry for all of these years.
---
It'd make for a great season before Scuba Steve expansion
---
Edit: I just saw your reply to BonerJamz19. Unfortunate
---
I would prefer if you could disable the auto jump when the bar is full
---
im not mad tho idc, i just feel bad for other people. Also can you stop name calling please? and go back to afking in LA?
---
If that's true then the point is indeed moot.
---
Radial mount menu is a 3rd party tool and should be banned by anet.
---
There was a while ago a post from Mike Z or Mike o Brian i dont remember, but he said  that rhey are not planning on putting cantha in the game but they will put it if the community demand is very big.
---
How? OP provided proof and I provided my own personal observation.
---
His group, his rules. Pugging is a lottery. Either live with it or find a static.
---
And he is correct, he wanted you to have 250 LI, he never lied about having them himself.
---
Am too poor for Mistlock :(
---
Im not sure, its just a theory. As in we forced them to submit to Aurene by well...destroying the residual malevolent spirits inside Kralkatorrik. Am i right? Not sure. This is just how i thought.
---
Sir Daniel Fortesque!
---
this. trial and error is not a "puzzle" it's just attrition of patience. draconis mons is too much of a trial with error too punishing
---
Don't know his name its been over 10 years since I played the game.
---
Yes, you can. We don't even know if this sub is not just a social experiment made by reptilians from ncsoft.
---
I mean, it makes sense. Taimi must have had so much built up frustration and resentment from the previous episodes where she feels like she can't do anything to help with the crisis anymore, and everyone's coddling her. Then, Captain sly shows her, well, that!
---
Got it :D
---
Thanks
---
There were no malevolent spirits though, that was just the magic itself.
---
Well, I guess... I can hardly immerse myself in the lore nowadays, it's all so disconnected from each other. You can see Balthazar statue covered with basked in Amnoon, and few minutes later everyone still worships him in Divinity Reach...
---
That's just for the first achievement. There are 5 achievements, each achievement is (we think) associated with at least one collection, each achievement is locked until the daily reset after you finished the one before it. i.e. complete 1st achievement -&gt; wait until daily reset -&gt; 2nd achievement unlocks, etc.
---
Scroll to the bottom of your "War Eternal" achievements and you'll see what I mean.
---
He tells Aurene that he hope she will never have to kill someone he loves.
---
So I guess he had to kill Glint even if he loved her?
---
Maybe also to put the plan in motion, but more than that because he was slave of his Torment.
---
Well, there is enough of girlfriend *material* in her to keep all GW2 incels supplied - if you know what I mean.
---
So community can benefit from this, after all.
---
I got some from pocket raptors so no.
---
I mean the maps arekinda stuck in time you should be aware of thst. They even were in GW1 aswell. You could go to Kourna maps and aee people being afraid of Abaddon ‘s Nightfall even tho you killed him
---
If we got Cantha I'd be soooo happy. There's so many cool things they could do with it.
---
Personally, and this may or may not be controversial, but I'd love to see The Afflicted still present throughout Cantha.
---
I know The Prophecy states that once Shiro dies, so does The Affliction, but I think it'd be wild if The Prophecy wasn't 100% correct and the disease was incurable or something
---
I have a genuine question for you, were you born like this, or did you become like this after the accident?
---
&gt;multiple posts queued up before hand and ready to go on launch day
---
It's not quite like this. Dulfy finds the secret stuff after the patch goes live like everyone else.
---
Critisism of the game should be punishable by capital punishment.
---
if you are not collecting skins and already got ascended gear what is your purpose in gw2?
---
oh god no
---
Maybe just [use the guide?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bomiqm/skyscale_scales_collection_unlock_thread/)
---
I played the game just short of a year after launch, and I loved the game and the story but I never had the energy to complete it. But I’ve managed to finish the core game to the latest patch finally back in March, and just watching the writing and game mechanics develop with each season and expansion quickly is a wonderful experience. I don’t think it’s noticeable unless you play it all one after another.
---
The base game is a little rocky when you compare it to the latest content. The characters feel more vibrant and emotional, the writing better and how the game programmers convey emotions lately is great. Especially for a mmo. It’s not your traditional one, and I love it for that. 
---
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again; Anet have really improved and gone strength to strength with how they tell the story in writing and mechanics. And they need to be recognised for this by their fans
---
ikr, it must've been cathartic for her, considering her frustrations from the past few episodes.
---
I wouldnt call ascended drops "exciting" at this point unless it's a brand new player.I dropped my first ascended from Tequatl and was super happy, now i have to buy bank expansions non-stop to store ascended drops.... The only exciting items in this game come from collections and crafting.
---
&gt; What were the small races supposed to do, just sit around and wait to be destroyed once all the elder dragons woke?
---
Run or hide like Kodan, Asura, Quaggan, etc, did. 
---
Ignorance is not an excuse. Them not knowing what killing ED results doesn't 
---
Elder Dragons are important. They had questionable ways to gather energy of course but they lived for millenias and they are not nice enough (or not anymore since they were done with mortals stubbornness or even they think of them as insects) to tell races to "go away because I will devour every magic in my sight".
---
I’m going to have to agree with you, OP! 
---
I haven’t played in a while, but this is definitely one of the best MMOs I’ve played, and I couldn’t believe it took me so long to try. I had a coworker always talking about it but was just like, ehhh. Do I really want to start a new MMO?
---
My main dude is also an engineer. An Iron Legion Charr engineer, of course. The toolkits are so cool. I love being able to switch between a wrench and a grenade launcher. The toolbelt skills are a neat little feature, too. 
---
One thing I thought was pretty damn unique was the thief. Their skill on 3 changes depending on the *combination* of weapons you have. So dual wielding pistols is going to give you a different 3 attack than if you have a pistol and a dagger, which will be different than using a dagger and a pistol. That was so cool to me the first time around.
---
I deserve this
---
I believe so yes, cause I did griffon in one day (but very hard day). There's I already spent 5 hours and it was the easiest and smallest I believe of all 5 parts. As far as we can see, we can know for sure only on saturday, when the last collection can open.
---
I know it's cover and she sings nice but those lyrics are awful.
---
Guess you speak out of experience if you know it's effective;) I don't care about him or somthing else I just wanna point out that people should not trust groupleaders to have they're kp.
---
I was expecting personal innuendo from you, accusing me of things I've never done only because I'm not sharing your views and ideals in life :)
---
Your dog cant talk ? hmm that's strange
---
I guess a big part of the community send her best wishes. ;-)
---
Hi, when you say " so long as all camps aren't T4." Will the events still spawn if one camp is T4 and the other two arent?
---
It’s been a few months since I last picked up Guild Wars 2, and I was wondering if there was any advice for someone who just came back. I stopped playing previously as I felt bored with the game and was wondering on how to make leveling seem less tedious.

I also don’t have anything on the account, and I was curious as to how much it would cost to get all the content up to date. I’ve heard the expansions are on sale right now, but not sure if I should get them even though I haven’t hit the level cap yet.  
---
Also, how does living world stuff contribute to your game content wise? What do you get out of it?
---
Also, the default Zerg announcer &amp; Zagara in StarCraft II / Heroes of the Storm
---
&gt; Maybe Shatterer defends the Brand that is closer to Kralkatorrik, and those far away from him do not require handcrafted minions?
---
The Shatterer was active in Blazeridge while Kralk was down towards Glint's lair.
---
&gt; Either way, it still looks like Kralk isn't going out of his way to attack Tyria. Even in LS4 he could have opened portals to any major cities and sent through minions or destroyed the cities personally. Instead we just had some mist portals that we force open and kill whatever that is inside.
---
Kralk definitely did not *care* about the mortals of Tyria, the stated assumption was him seeking out more lucrative sources of magic though.
---
&gt; Imagine facing Zhaitan with Kralkatorrik's magic, or Mordremoth with Zhaitan + Kralkatorrik magic.
---
What exactly would that entail anyway? I don't think we ever learned Kralk's second domain, if he even had any.
---
Very good timing :-) I wish you can do a wallpaper maybe (-:
---
Apparently so should liking the game too. Huh.
---
I really thought posting how I like the game, in the sub about the game would get some positive feedback.
---
hopefully the op edits the post to include these, well done :)
---
I need my Pact Marshal... just not this one.
---
I bet my money anet wanted to stop focusing on dragons so much and make a brand new script. Most of dragon's watch are also gonna go back to their homes and generally separate ways. There were too many allied npc's at this point and i think anet struggled to keep up and give them all some meaningful attention. U could see that marjory and kashmir have been completely absent, canach as well, its almost impossible to fit so many scripts into an episode without making it forced.
---
No1 can accurately guess where it's gonna go at this point cause for the first time in years anet has the ability to write something completely new from scratch instead of focusing on elder dragons which gets repetitive after a few years.
---

&gt; Apparently so should liking the game too. Huh.

Quite the victim complex. Where does it stem from?
---
&gt;I really thought posting how I like the game, in the sub about the game would get some positive feedback.
---
So...You wanted to circlejerk?
---
Can you elaborate on that?
---
The spirit bears had me thinking that they might be working towards cantha next season, even though it's just an effect changing an existing enemy.
---
She has had advanced access to patches before though
---
Last Surprise would probably have been a better song choice as far as Persona 5 soundtracks go
---
I just started playing as well! It's a lot of fun so far
---
Wow classic is overrated and people will notice once they played it for a bit. It is also essentially different from gw2 so why exactly would it "hurt" anyone to try both and make an opinion?
---
Have you completed the personal story, yet? Do you have the expacs? 
---
I recommend silverwastes as a new challenge if you haven't been there yet. It's one of my favorite core maps.  There are always events going on you can participate in, lots of loot, a hidden death maze, and a nice armor collection.
---
It's more complicated than that, but the simple answer to this exact case would be, No.  
---
And yeah, thinking about the render distance made me realized he was resized. But it definitely wasn't to save resources.
---
Actually, you can use the disable autojump option to be able to do regular jump with jump key and then use mount action key for charged jump
---
This is particularly useful with bunny and jackal
---
Yeah but when I have to do future open world stuff, naturally I am going to want the BiS mount. I want to turn the game into flyover country
---
This is amazing! How did i skip this? Also the post needs more upvotes :D
---
Zojja wont happen because of Felicia Day
---
What stats do they have?
---
Tyria itself is a dragon. calling it now.
---
I don't want tons of story content. I want tons of challenging, instanced, repeatable content (see: raids, dungeons)
---
But that was not confirmed in this episode was it? Even in the interpretation where the main avatar encompassed all the other stray magic we still don't know when it first became a problem.
---
I don't know why he'd look for a Firebrigade comp (you said you're Quickbrand) and run CMs without Healer (since you were forced to relog) ... thats just retarded.
---
I know those 5x dps groups very well and its allways a godforsaken clusterfuck of a run, I prefer smooth clears with a Healer so I dont need to dodge everything the boss flings at me, especially Artsarriv sucks so much with all DDs.
---
Really don't get those 250 KP guys tbh, who keeps their killproofs and does not buy infusions with it?
---
But yeah there are guys who simply look to get carried, just kick them if they fail too often or lack dps.
---

Now i just expect in some future event A-net to put an npc that is 2 skritt on top of each other badly covered by a medium coat. because something supposedly has a height requirement.
---
When I'm doing fractals where on my screen should I be looking? The boss hp, my skill bar, or my character? Or is there somewhere else I should mainly focus my eyes on?
---
I play alacrity renegade in fractals for the most part if this is important.
---
yeah now we mostly rely on tekkitsworkshop for any early collectible guides
---
Well the malevolent nature of the magic? Theres a reason they personified as Balthazar, Zhaitan and Mordremoth. Those facets were the reason Kralkatorrik's Torment was so powerfully influencing Kralk im assuming, otherwise we wouldnt need to kill them. That, or the 3 facets are what created his Torment. We basically beat it into being good so Aurene can take it into herself.
---
You are a gentleman and a scholar. Thank you very much!
---
No. I have no problem with doing the collections. I‘d just prefer if they’d hide the mastery until you actually unlock the mount, like they did with the griffon.
---
Of course! It was my pleasure!
---
You're very welcome!
---
The cooldown is character bound btw, can just delete the character and make a new one.
---
Not quite, the Ironfist exotic *doesn't* use the Ironfist skin.
---
I was looking to buy it for the same reason. I hope they don't change Bloodstone Fen as well, exploring it with alts is just a fun activity that shouldn't hurt the key sales.
---
Ascended Box - selectable. I think it has all the options. Divinder, Harrier, Minstrel and Magi are in there
---
i mean, people have been calling this ending since 2014 when they introduced the egg. 
---
as much as i would love gw2 to turn into a post-magic-apocalyptic setting, it wasnt going to happen
---
Drafts, thermal tubes, ley lines, bouncing mushrooms, and oakheart masteries. It gave a huge amount of movement freedom to people who played HoT and those episodes. Totally awesome &lt;3
---
I don't see how recharging TPTF is any help at all for spamming bloodstone fen map completion. Waiting an hour per teleport (per POI/WP functionally) is pretty stupid compared to just completing the map quickly with a griffon on each character.
---
Nobody who is level 15 uses the terminology around kits turrets and engineers. I'm a sylvari "as far as I can tell". What? 
---
Hi Anet.
---
Every response is a circle jerk. No way this person is only level 15 and knows as much as this guy does. I love this game too but what? 🤣
---
&gt; Maybe Mordremoth just wasn't the best of dragons to begin with and that magic drove him "crazy" really quick because of it. We don't necessarily have to see conflict within, he could have succumbed to his darker impulses and just went ham. A zealot more than a tortured soul.
---
But both Kralk's symptoms and general magic overload manifest as pained craze. Mordremoth still had the presence of mind to speak cohesively and interact with us as individuals. "Moral corruption" is not part of the deal and doesn't really make sense in context because the magic would need to adhere to *our* morals for that to work out.
---
&gt; Maybe the Risen and Zhaitan did just hear meaningless noise. 24/7 static and white noise can drive you mad, and it doesn't necessarily take away capacity for intelligent thought and organization but it sure can make one angry. "Hearing" Zhaitan probably isn't a good thing for the individual psyche of the Risen either, being inside the brain of an all powerful magic obsessed dragon can't be good. Look at Scarlet.
---
But the stronger Risen were pretty high-functioning while Scarlet was completely crazy. I doubt the Syska, Kitah Manse or Blue Orb sabotage plots would have been within Scarlet's capability by the end of LS1 where she was actually getting corrupted.
---
&gt; I don't think manipulation is that far fetched personally, and we have seen many Gods and godlike beings go insane in world already, Abaddon wasn't the first or the last.
---
I'm just fed up with all these "ooh, Abaddon is behind it" ideas.
---
That makes it even more hilarious then. They didn't even test the item to see how it could be exploited. I know its hard to have a QA team but come on, you can't let stuff like this happen. Anet, you're becoming a joke of a company. I *really* grow tired of these things slipping through the cracks so often.
---
You probably unlocked: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ironfist_(skin)
---
That is hilarious ... and scary. Don't give Taimi weapons.
---
oof, right in the feels
---
That's pretty scary.
---
Anything that can drop exotic gear could drop boxes of ascended gear with core stats and core ascended trinkets, and that probably was moved to unidentified gear bags.
---
But it's so insanely rare people forget about it.
---
That's a trinket with harrier stats, so it's likely a direct drop from enemies or a champion bag, not unidentified gear.
---
Since the threat of Dragons (and Tyria exploding from excess magic) seems to be resolved for now, I think it would be nice to turn back to some smaller scale threats. I'd say the Joko and White Mantle arcs were some of the better ones so more antagonists like that would be nice; especially if it could tie up old loose ends from racial stories like the White Mantle. Even if it isn't the only focus on S5 (and onward), I could at least see some playing a role in S5, like how Joko was main threat for first half of S4 before it shifted back to Kralk.
---
As for Dragons, there is a good chance the whole "new age of magic" will come up, perhaps similar to how the overflowing magic was in S3. There is also the whole "mother" line that could be hinting at learning more on the origins of the Elder Dragons, which could even tie into the Gods (or Joko...). So while the Gods did leave in POF, they may not be gone from the story. There was also a lot of foreshadowing around Lyssa. But since PoF was very human-focused, I feel like we'll take a break from the human gods for a while.
---
Bubbles is another potential direction the story could go, especially if it is leading towards a Cantha expansion.One other thing to remember is that Primordius and Jormag had their energy return to pre-awakening levels, but that doesn't mean they will stay asleep... And what dragons wake, it tends to have bad side effects on the world so that will probably come back to bite us sooner or later.
---
She didn't really absorb them.
---
If you remember the kesho (was that the name of the lost city in PoF?) cinematic, they talk about how aurene will not accumulate magic, but share it with the world.
---
So she "cleans" their magic and gives it back in a balanced manner.
---
This way there is no need for the dragons' cycles anymore.
---
Oh didn't know that. I hope they don't delete key chance from Bloodstone Fen or prevent alts from teleporting there. The other solution would be making an account bound 1 hour cooldown, but that may annoy some people who use the item for other purposes.
---
The House is protecting their gamble income :)
---
Working toward it is fine but *time gating* stuff **really sucks**, no matter what is gated. :I   
---
I can't speak for everyone, but personally I'd much rather do steady progress with the collections, instead of having to wait till the next daily reset in between of them. It makes progressing unnecessarily timely, especially if one doesn't have enough time to finish a collection before the daily reset.  
---
I can't really say much about the Skyscale collection yet though. I finished the egg collection a few hours ago and will be at work through the night, so I don't know how much stuff there's still to do. Only just found out there's still more to come after the daily reset.
---
... *Why?*
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/boyk6j/its_been_said_but_the_story_my_god/eno9hek
---
This 🤣 nobody uses the absolute terms like kits, engineer, combo fields when they're level 15. "I think I'm a sylvari" lolwut.
---
Okay, let me clarify once more. Iron Hammer, Ironfist and Bloodbound Hammer skins are exactly the same, but Iron Hammer and Ironfist skin called Iron Hammer is unlocked separately to Bloodbound Hammer skin, which is called Ironfist.
---
I have no idea how that "also" appeared there. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Yea i'm mentally checking out. on scale 4. And just, theres so much rampant"oh dont worry the sky scales are everywere! Don't forget to get them". Guys I used to sell  raid  CM clears and solo lupi way back in the day for fun.
---
And how do you get your new character to the map? Portal Scrolls are Lvl 80 only.
---
Was weeping at this moment. Brava, Aurene.
---
I will have you know that logan is actually valid and gets the job done, although its not at rytlock level. Dont be so elitist &gt;.&lt;
---
The season 3. Season 4 has no hype.
---
Yes, but you wont get all that much space from it.
---
What you're saying doesn't really agree with the "Omg if we let kralk eat the mists he'll devour reality itself, these are the end times" vibes we've been getting these past few episodes
---
And probably Karka too, do not forget Karka...
---
The camera shakes like crazy when the ship is maneuvering (which does pretty often), sadly the dialogue is really infrequent.
---
Will check next time, thank you!
---
The best possible outcome for players would be added heart requiring person to kill like 5 enemies; but what we may expect to get is either removal of key/charge from BF completion or blocking TP to friend to locations that usually have level requirement for non level 80 characters.
---
Man I wish turrets didn't suck ass...
---
This episode had the best map I think.
---
Episode 5 had the best story instance by far.
---
Because you need to be level 80 to use those. With the teleport to a friend you can create a new character, go to the map, explore, transfer loot, delete, rinse and repeat.
---
I ended up reformatting and played for an hour nothing happend if it happens again I’ll post the picture! Thank you for the help guys!
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tyria_(world)

Here it says "first settled in Cantha"
---
I'd totally be okay with bubbles being Danzig this whole time
---
Can we talk about [](#s "how ol Kralk said "mother..." before he kicked the bucket? No?")
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 one of us
---
shut up baby, i know it
---
Well there’s a datamined item called the Gift of Aurene, and they also added a way to purchase each LS4 map currency from the main vendor on the new map (only 5/day each) so I’m guessing there’s something like Aurora coming up soon. I just hope they don’t merge the LS4 maps and the currencies with some Coalescence-tied collections instead.
---
HA! ... I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought of this when seeing the picture.
---
Teal'c would be proud.
---
What fell from the sky?
---
Is WoW classic going to attract anyone aside from the group of WoW players that have been specifically asking for a vanilla WoW server?
---
You should just count yourself lucky they didn't ban you for exploiting it while it lasted.
---
When you fly into the mouth.
---
I wouldnt blame her if she wanted to take a long break or if she just wants to hang it up because gw2 isnt popular enough, that being said leaving people in the dark is kind of shitty
---
As long as her health is fine, that's the most important thing. But we appreciate all the stuff she's done for us in the past.
---
I mean we literally scrambled to block the ley lines feeding Kralk, and we now know there are ley lines just under the sea, who knows what cascading issues we've just caused for ol sbubbles..
---
Yes. There are 5 main collections, time gated by daily resets. Once finishing the first collection, you need to wait until a daily reset passes for the next to be unlocked, then repeat with all of them.
---
Using the game mechanics as intended isn't exploiting.  Not my problem Anet is fucking stupid and doesn't see the logical conclusions to their own items.  People have been doing this for years with the normal TP to friend.
---
I mean until LS4 Kralkatorrik did not pose too much threat. The mist eating part was poorly told in story IMO, how fast can Kralk eat up the whole of  the reality anyway?
---
So using TP to friend to explore BF as much as the charges allow isn't an exploit, but using the permanent TP to friend to spam explore is an exploit?
---
edit: Not being snarky either, I am just curious whether they considered using TP to friend to explore BF with an alt as an exploit all along, or they consider the spam exploration through permanent TP to friend as exploit and not explorations with regular TP to friend charges.
---
What a wholesome post! I'm glad you're enjoying the game, and you have so much to look forward to. There's always something to go for in GW2. :D
---
There is also not much else to do.
---
I appreciate your appreciation! lol
---
Have a great night!
---
Go check a guide
---
Ah yeah. Didnt thaught about that
---
Yes... because one of them runs out, and the other has infinite uses.
---
Making the debuff account bound would be a super shitty thing to do
---
That would be cool, but what I'd really like is Logans armour set from this story ep.
---
Except the 700 o Kourna's currency. I was making it and bailed halfway. Life's too short to farm that everyday, that map is so ugly lol
---
Yes I’m well aware. I will be doing that, however, I would like a more personal response from players.
---
Artificially stretching content between daily resets doesn't make it substantial content. To me all it signals is a lack of ability or desire to make actually engaging content for players.
---
You may be retarded, but don't fret. God loves each one of his little creatures.
---
A million torments!!!!
---
At least it's not time gated and rng based like the first legendary armor raid collection
---
Aw hell yeah. I felt the same way when I started playing. Taking a break now but it's been my longest standing MMO ever lol.
---
What does that make Tekkit?
---
I'd love to help, as I main FB, but I play support. If you're ever after help with healer/supporting, I can assist there.
---
Well, I've never seen your post, so ....
---
Yeah, so thats why I expect them to just change BF. Its just sad though.
---
I wish this game would have glory as Tera Online had to live for so many years and be profitable in smart ways. Many do not believe the restrictions in game reality are more harsh than what they tell on their webpage, but it is the truth.  
---
Not a cool way to inspire people to buy your game.
---
They did the same to Southsun Cove
---
That would also be helpful, I normally do well as support, but I also need to fend for myself as well. That’s what I’m running into an issue with.
---
"Whenever Dulfy isn't on the internet people should be asking 'Where's Dulfy?' "
---
I was just making sure whether the exploit they were referring to was completely due to their lack of testing, thanks.
---
I don't quite understand how this works. Do these people create lvl2 characters and then just use the item to teleport to a friend in bsf, map complete despite being underlevelled af, delete character, and repeat the process?
---
When the map was released the portal scrolls weren't restricted to level 80, but they changed it within a few days to prevent people from farming map completions there.
---
I have been decorating for a very long time I searched by myself and I even made a video presentation of the decorations
---
 /shrug all the better then, was a simple post showing each new GH decoration ;p  Honestly can't wait to see what other hellscape type scenes people make with this decoration.
---
Ohhhh your crush is edited

Sounds about right then.

I can map complete Bloodstone Fen with a level 1 character in under 3 minutes, 0 deaths.

Oh that's why I got nothing for map completing on an alt just now. Way to waste 2 hours! :D

I first thought that the shadow army doesn't need menzies to exist, many minions of many other beings still exist after their leader are dead after all. But then it occured to me if balthazar had won, he would not have let menzies army be in the fissure of woe in the first place.
---
I have a spare PoF code if you want it!
---
I dont think we know yet. The achievement collections are time gated so we are only on day 2 of 6.
---
I know about the asc gear, but I've never heard of asc trinkets in open world. And it's common enough that usually over 1 or 2 runs will have someone telling everyone in mapchat about their asc loot. So not finding any mention about asc trinket drop in open world on the wiki is what leaves me skeptical.
---
Yeah, not a fan of the 5 day time lock thing they did. I was really looking forward to it because I'm a loser who likes dragons lol
---
PMed, thanks a bunch!
---
As far as I’ve seen it’s easy to do solo, there’s about 4 collections total that are timegated behind daily reset so I can’t say anything about those yet.
---
Man i wish Taimi was more like this. Then I might not just be waiting for her to die
---
Kralk mentioned a female, the first of her kind. Could see Kasmeer turning out to be Lyssa in disguise, and the whole surprise at seeing Balthazar back in the last season being her realising he's not actually sealed (or even could be fake surprise). Would explain how kralk escaped her and Marjory, if she mesmerised Marjory and let kralk escape on purpose.

"You know commander, I think I am beginning to see why you like what you do. The sound of guns, striking swords, the smell of gunpowder and burning dragon minions...A girl could get used to this."
---
Yeah in WvW you usually go for Marauder Set (maybe with Rune of Durability) instead of fullzerk.
---
In PvE its not recomended running it tho since you allready have like 3 dodgerolls and you will loose a lot of damage. As Thief you have the same HP Pool as Elementalists and Guardians, around 11k HP and that can drop down to 8k if you enter Fractals with certain affixes etc. but just stick with it and gitgud - you don't need to run the damagebuff for missing Endurance Bars if you want to keep some dodgerolls for yourself, but since you're forced to dodge anyways because your Grandmaster Traits demand so you better not switch those Traitlines around.
---
Thiefes are not as tanky as Guardians by far but also can dupe around way more compared to Elementalists. If you struggle with damage mitigation you might want to read some Guides for encounter Mechanics.
---
In PvE Open World you can just run a WvW build and go for P/P or Rifle Deadeye but for instanced Content just stay Daredevil.
---
&gt;ccount boun
---
no if you know a good route to complete it with griffon, it took me 5 min to do the whole process
---
Bug in the System. Amazing trailer, fantastic Inquest dialogue, the introduction of a new, interesting Charr culture, and the only known renown heart that's fun enough to repeat just because.
---
Then go play something else? Why would you play this if you don't like it?
---
Ahh my apologies, I was under the impression that it was ascended
---
Wait, so you were willing to have a huge collection you'd have to get, knowing that you only get a couple hours a day to play at most. Which means, presumably, you were willing to finish that collection over multiple days.
---
Now you're upset that you have to finish the collection over multiple days?
---
Have you ever seen them in the same room?
---
Wow, it must suck being gen 1 elder dragon, huh?
---
Though I would say zhaitan and mordremoth had quite a lot of fun with events from core and hot. I mean except final parts
---
We could have actual places on Tyria be threatened rather than this 'oh no Mists are eaten' thing. They wouldn't need to add new events to maps or destroy LA again either, story instances where we fight Branded in major cities would be fine.
---
Lol i fockin wish anet payed me, would probably be a helluva lot better than what i earn
---
never claimed to have *played* **all** of them - i meant that I hopped around and just couldnt find a fun, satisfying one. this one is. none of them hooked me, this one did.
---
^buy ^the ^dlc
---
Hey man if you ever wanna explore the fractals friend Shinyanne. I take new players through it all the time and it’s tons of fun (it’s like mini-raids). Glad to see you’re loving it!
---
Wait which heart do you mean?
---
Wait how do I get 1 free key per week?
---
This here, if they released even just "common" looking skins for some of these categories, would make all the difference to several metas I can think of off the top of my head.
---
Reminds of these weird tourists that take happy selfies in front of holocaust or black death monuments and memorials.
---
Time means nothing in the Mists
---
&gt;Should I start a new character?
---
If you want, just don't delete the old ones, birthday gifts!
---
It wouldn't hurt to pick up where you left off, but if you want a fresh experience, starting over is perfectly reasonable. That being said, you have some pretty low level characters which are pretty much new anyways, and build swapping is so easy in this game that it won't really matter what they were like when you stopped.
---
&gt; I have no idea where I was or what I should be doing on the character skillwise. 
---
Understandable. If you want, you can look at places like metabattle to get a sense of what end game builds look like. In terms of level 1-80 content, it hasn't changed all that much, so events, exploration, pvp, all of those are pretty viable options
---
&gt; Will I be completely lost 
---
Maybe, since you've been gone so long, if you've forgotten everything. But things haven't really changed so much that it will be unrecognizable.
---
&gt;and have the skills changed a lot? 
---
We get a lot more freedom with build variety now, because you don't have to pay for specializations and swapping them out can be done on the fly. Some skills have gotten overhauls, some have been removed, etc, but in general it's not super different
---
&gt; Also should I get the DLC?
---
If you want the best experience, yes
---
&gt;  Is it worth having right now and am I missing out on anything without it? 
---
Kind of. Most of the stuff is level 80, but some things can be accessed earlier
---
1) both expansions give access to the revenant class for you to level up
---
2) Heart of Thorns gives access to gliding, and Path of Fire gives access to mounts. You'll need someone to help you out if you don't have a level 80 character, but these can be used on any character on your account.
---
https://i.imgur.com/jMspSZ5.jpg
---
I have Path of Fire, but nothing else, what will I need to purchase for the full experience (if anything) and how much will it cost in USD?  
---
Thanks.
---
From what piece does the bow tie come?
---
the black lion key section on the wiki lists all the ways, but one way is the personal stories
---
I now love taimi.....EVEN MOREEE!!! DIEEE BRANDED SCUM!!!!!
---
yeah this too !
---
Well, I always think that whenever I see one of the main characters have a new set of armor xD
---
As an overall episode, episode 4 did it best for me. It was just a great package all around, with a great map, good rewards, a great story (good writing, nice pacing), and the addition of Sun's Refuge. I loved the events there a lot as well. 
---
However, gameplay wise, the most epic vibes I got during the ep5 Kralk fight, 
---
and map wise, Dragonfall really nails it. 
---
Still, my overall favorite episode is A Star To Guide Us.
---
Just use Marauder's stats instead of Berserker! It lowers your damage a bit but boosts your HP by a lot.
---
I just want to go to Tahnnakai Temple and talk with Master Togo ;.;
---
To be fair they wouldn't release exploits they saw coming.
---
Yeah ideally, no time gate would be better
---
Thank you for your reply. I think I'll try and muddle through on a lower character and if I'm too lost start a new one. 
---
Sounds like I'll have to get the DLC when I can afford it.
---
Thanks again  :D
---
Read a Guide first, read your weapon-/ skills and traitlines -thoroughly- then look at what content you're progressing and come ask -specific- questions again.
---
I main Guardian since release and running as Firebrand / Dragonhunter in Fractal CMs etc. so if you need anything you can just answer here or send me a PM.

I kind of hate the Loyalist mobs in Istan and don't go there often, but it was a great episode with a very tense final instance.
---
Honestly, if it weren't for the official announcement, I would've thought that the game was just expected to end there :/
---
The 1st "collection collection" isnt gated at all. After the eggs there are to my understanding only 4 days of timegated stuff.
---
If you only want actual gameplay-related stuff, just buy HoT and you're good to go. You'll have access to all the Raids/Fractals/etc.
---
If you want story, you'll have to catchup and buy LWS2, 3, and 4. These can be bought with Gold if you convert them to Gems. If you don't get these, you may miss out on some maps and maybe 1-2 hours of story per episode.
---
LWS4E3 has access to the Roller Beetle, though. That is the only notable exception.
---
Would've been useful to have the international, English names straight in the video, but at least you put them in the description.
---
She is so cute and badass when she goes full maniac! I love her!!!! &lt;3
---
Just remove the stupid permanent teleport to friend dangit.
---
They used the same sentence even on the second phase when there's no wall xD  
---
Always brakes immersion a little but got used to it \^\_\^
---
Welcome to Tyria, you have a long journey ahead. ENJOY!

For the Fire Elemental Powder the wiki says 'The summoned ember is set to the local effective level..'. I am not sure I quite understand what that means. Do they spawn at the character's level or the map's? For instance, if a level 30 player uses this item in a level 50 map, will the elemental be at level 30 or 50?
---
Maybe an upcoming short story in the style of the requiem ones? I would really want to know what the picture for it would look like xD
---
&gt;"You have to be yay tall to ride the griffon.", the bulky Norn declared, pointing to to a wooden construction that had been attached to the griffon roost.   
---
&gt;"Yes yes, Balthazar is! Is big god. Yes yes".  
---
&gt;A pair of eyes peeked out of the scrap metal armour that had been painted with child like drawing of flames.   They gleamed at the sight of the starbound griffon.  
---
&gt;"Shiny" a faint voice echoed out of the depth of the suite of armor.
---
Speaking from history, if ArenaNet says that they are looking or will look into something, take it with a heap of salt.
---
no because at least I could do it at my own pace, and how quickly I did complete it wasnt dictated by resets. And because of the reset time gating, a grind that probably would have taken me a week in my free time will now probably take multiple weeks
---
It's obvious as hell you have issues with her being a lesbian, plain and simple.
---
The existance of lesbians is not political and as @Platomuses said, it's YOU who makes this a political thing. People like you don't see homosexual people as real humans so everytime they're represented in the media (this representation matters, the more lgbt characters the better understanding people should gain about them) you think it's just because of the pandering or ''politics''. No, it's because they exist in the real world. They're normal. Take your prejudice out of this community.
---
It was more of a Futaba situation though since he kind of wanted it.
---
To be fair, almost all maps pretty much are squares, why the surprise?  
---
This map is focused on sky playing with skyscale, so no underwater content, etc.
---
&gt;Edit 2: please stop sending me DLC codes! please! I already got one! I thank you all so much but please, go make someone elses day! my years already been made :)
---
Ha! Totally cracked up when I read this. This community is amazing. Love ya’ll!
---
&gt;  what on earth are you doing that requires such a constant supply of spirit shards?
---
Ascended and legendary gear
---
I hit level 80 a day ago but now i am looking in to what i should do next
