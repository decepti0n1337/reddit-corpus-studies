And if people didn't mind soiling themselves sometimes, we would need fewer restrooms.

If systems mastery is not a legitimate end, we should eliminate builds. If it is a legitimate end, we should fully support builds. A middle ground of, "There's a best answer, but if you care about it, you're a fucking *nerd*," is not at all legitimate.

Really? Are you using the ticker at the NYSE to read this? Text just *appears* lol this isnt MS DOS with the green letters showing up one by one

I mean I did that for years until switching to Arcdps.  I'm not sure I have any desire to go back to the "5 minutes of switching gear manually to get into a fight and have overlooked (despite checking 5 times) the obvious missing Rune and therefore have shittier dps" of the old "click the legendary" days.  
---
I wish Anet had never allowed templates from Arc honestly because all of this is just a massive downgrade now and the game is going to feel shitty because of it for people like me
---
I can play the full version of GTA San Andreas on my phone, the best version of Final Fantasy Tactics, etc.  There are games that play very well on phones.  Why play it on my phone instead of a portable game system?  Because unlike my 3DS, I always have my phone on me... and it's just as powerful if not more-so than my PSP (I can actually run every psp game ever made on it) or 3DS.
---
Totally worth buying it. At first in 2012 people complained you did the whole content after one month. I came 4 years later and found a really rich game with a lot of stuff to do, too much in fact.
---
After 2 years of spamming raids/fractals I stopped the game because the new content is too slow to come. So basically you can have 2 years playing only gw2 before feeling the urge to complain in Reddit that updates are too slow. I think buying gw2 is worth it yes.
---
When I switched to another game I had two choices: another game that is 4+ years old or one that just came out. Of course the first has less bugs, more content and way more QoL (this is really important, especially as a new player)
---
NO!  It's all doooooooooooom!
---
Heh. I hear “shoot me you bitch”
---
During one of the LWS4 cutscenes, the commander says "dammit" and it made my day
---
Who owns the Guild Wars IP?  Anet or O'brian?
---
i feel personally fucking attacked
---
and farming peoples homes
---
Tl;Dr, Anet gives a new QoL content that is a great improvement for new players and full of flaws for veterans that have been committed since a long time
---
And tl;Dr of your question: yes the new content frequency is really bad but you have 7 years of content to do before having the right to complain. Totally worth buying it, come back in a few years complaining on Reddit after, it is fun you will see
---
So I imagine they are going to start banning people who use arcdps now ...
---
* There has been 7 known elder dragons total. 
---
* There used to be 6, now there's 4.
---
* The "[Antikythera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYY-41xUZLk)" representation of the 6 dragons and Tyria has 8 orbs:
---
 * Blue for the Deep Sea Dragon
---
 * Dark green for Zhaitan
---
 * Light green (lime) for Modremoth
---
 * Purple for Kralkatorrik
---
 * Light blue (cyan) for Jormag
---
 * Orange for Primordus
---
 * White for "The Soul of Tyria", and a large orb around Tyria littered with small bright dots, likely for all living things on Tyria. 
---
* The [Exalted](https://youtu.be/ZtqDLw0D5HM?t=10) representation is mostly the same, but presented as a octahedron, with the 6 dragons on he vertices of the octahedron and Tyria in the middle as a cube, coming together and getting positioned so they appear as as two hexagons. The colors are the same: Orange, lime, green, cyan, blue, and purple.
---
Currently, 3 Dragons are dead, 4 alive, and the 3 dead ones are being partially replaced:
---
* Jormag of ice (light blue/cyan).
---
* Primordus of fire (orange).
---
* Deep sea of water (blue).
---
* And Aurene of Light. She's taking the load of 3 dragons (green, purple, lime). That can't be possibly last too long. So we'll likely have to find more friendly magical entities to share the burden with her. And then replace the other dragons. Or find some other alternative like cleansing them of magical corruption and convince them to be sharers instead hoarders.
---
no because it has all the anal-retentive EU RPers lmao
---
If your character is lvl50, you're effectively worthless in WvW anyway. Get yourself to 80 before you even consider WvW.

She is fundamentally different to her forefathers. You'll learn about it later.

Nice joke buddy, ya got me good.
---
I am still trying to finish the core story haha. I do have HoT, PoF, Season 2-3 purchased. But I am going through the story with my cousins, and they're taking a while.
---
That being said, I'll probably grab Season 4. And do the leyline anomaly achievement to get 3 teleport to friends. And teleport to Dragonfall.
---
Eventually the population pool becomes so small, you not only know them, you know their alts and account names, what their favorite splits are (home, mid, far) how good they are at rotating, how aggressive they dodge attacks, what attacks you can bait them with, if they can do the high maneuver jump puzzles for kitting... ect.  when you start tech-ing skills for specific people, it's bad.
---
Try and convince a friend to play through the story with you
---
So there was a [guild chat a few days ago](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/488895446?t=23m) that goes over it all but the idea is that by default you have 2 equipment templates and you can slot whatever gear you want in there. Gear in the templates is stored in hidden storage for that character and is view able when equipping (but is no longer in inventory, basically it's on your character). If you want to use the same gear in multiple gear sets, that's fine it just gains a link icon showing that it's used in another set. Any time you change a "template" it updates so really they are more like 2 loadout slots rather than full templates. If you equip sword/shield in one set and then say scepter/ the same shield that's fine, if you want to swap the shield in one template out for a focus you can do that too but now that template has focus. So no, the "templates" don't snapshot they are really just multiple separate loadouts and any changes are updated to them (which is my biggest complaint)
---
&gt; And unlike in many mobile games I dont have to pay to unlock skills or cooldown reduction timers or entire classes or units or whatever 
---
Once again, you are being illogical. You keep justifying the context of micro-transactions. Micro transactions are what they are. You can keep making excuses, but GW2 has the same exact functions as a mobile app's micro-transactions.
---
It's the Robert Gee curse. He designs overpowered characters compared to the other designers :D
---
I don't think so. It looks like it's just equip/unequip but in different tabs.
---
Consortium is faster regardless of if you animation cancel. Animation cancelling buys you about 200ms though
---
A few points.
---
 If you get 6 builds or whatever, that's 6 you dont have to keep moving. The rest is biz as usual. So you get convenience, just not 12  builds worth. 
---
You dont need to optimize that hard. 
---
Why would anet not want to sell as many as they could? Is there a technical reason why we are limited? Anet usually isnt shy when It comes to selling things on the store i.e character slots. So what's the reason we are limited?
---
Neither. NCSoft.
---
The ones with leg armors using arcdps are fucked though. And they said leg runes will be good for buildtemplates. Well...
---
My Revenant templates where a good example of convenience to me (In PvE, and with Legendary armor)
---
-Condi Ren
---
-Power Alacrigade (I had 2 variants)
---
-Heal tank Alacrigade
---
-Heal non-tank Alacrigade
---
-Heal Herald (Which admittedly didn't get used outside of the occasional fractal carry)
---
Now my Power Alacrigade was made twice for the idea of using Pack Runes or Scholar Runes. But to make up for the extra Boon Duration, I swapped some Diviner gear to Berserkers gear.
---
Sounds minor, yes. But the fact I would have constantly had to have said something like "Five minute guys, let me remember what pieces I could swap"" **every time** I went into a raid where I needed that other variant would be an inconvenience. (Which was quite a bit, considering I also ran a lot fractals+CMs before where the Scholar was better)
---
&gt;&gt;"the same few builds with minor variations"
---
So yes, minor variation but one that I would even consider thanks to speed of swapping provided by Arc Templates. And yes, the timeframe I reference above is *about* accurate, because it was about 4-5 pieces I could change.
---
And for those that would say "You don't need it." I personally hate knowing I can do something to help the group but actively don't. If we're lacking in Might (for example), I see that as my fault.
---
1. Follow the TacO route to gather them
---
2. Do the hearts daily and buy from there
---
3. Buy them from Dragonfall daily
---
4. Follow event trains to do events.
---
Part of my big love for slight variations was that the UI for swapping legendary gear, even now, is dreadful to work with quickly. Arc Templates made me able to get them in 3 swift clicks while I run to the next fight.
---
In context of that mission, there were 6 Elder Dragons (Primordus, Jormag, Zhaitan, Kralkatorrik, Mordremoth, and the unnamed deep sea dragon), and 2 died (Zhaitan and Mordremoth).
---
I'm just gonna say your bias is showing there, cause everyone has been clamoring for build templates.
---
And I also don't think it'll add much in the way of downtime. There's always downtime between bio breaks and waiting for people to swap characters or sell or whatever. Like I said, unless you're in a full clear speedrun, the actual time added will be negligible.
---
I really dont want to have to go through the builds I play for each game mode :( I might do it another time when I'm not already busy, however... suffice to say there's at least one build variation per PvE, WvW, and PvP mode.
---
I don't think you looked hard enough.  
---
  
---
*NCsoft is a shit* company which you will learn if you knew how to google, living word is a 2-3 month release window, and go to the GW2 partner page and tell me how many of them are active with large fan bases. Then go look up the top viewed partners and see how many of them are not playing classic wow.  
---
Judging from your post history, simply calling people out that don't share your opinion instead of offering critique, already tells me so much about highly "credible" account. Go back to the AMD threads my friend.
---
Idk, not my experience, but great that you don't run into that problem.
---
There is no difference.
---
The amount of misinformation going around in regards to build templates is insane. Any armor that goes into the Armory(where your gear is stored) can be taken out at any time. You lose no gear, all it does is save you bag space.
---
As of writing this Grothmar Tribun is not repeateble. (It is missing the flag for that in the [API](https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements/4954).)

Map completion in Grothmar Valley gives you ["Recovered" Charr Artifact](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/%22Recovered%22_Charr_Artifact) and not [Grothmar Legionnaire Weapon Requisition](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grothmar_Legionnaire_Weapon_Requisition) which comes form Grothmar Tribune.
---
you're not wrong but that fact and the increasing cancer that is microtransactions have just turned me off mmos in general, i'll wait and see if anything decent comes out while playing / doing other stuff.
---
That's incorrect. A-Net owns the Guild Wars IP. NCSoft is a PUBLISHER. Basically they give funds to A-Net to develop the game but then the game carries the NCSoft logo, which often times can mean a lot in a market. Obviously funds ARE limited and based on earnings. So if GW 2 doesn't do well, NCSoft loses money that was invested. And then they apply pressure to make sure their investment keeps afloat. 
---
In a sense, NCSoft owns a part of Guild Wars 2 but not the whole. If A-Net wants to break free from NCSoft, they could, but they lose on funding. Not to mention that it's likely that they are under contract and if they break that, they breach it and probably owe NCSoft money instead. It depends on what the contract states.
---
Look at Destiny 2. Destiny 2 was published by Activision but they never owned the IP. Bungie does. They broke free from their publisher and now self-publish Destiny 2. I'm positive there was a lot of legal hoopla involved to be able to do that.
---
This is what we are given when Anet doesn't play its own game and doesn't care that some are abusive to others no matter what is said or what we do.
---
Question: are you the guy above having a good day? or the guy below having a bad one?
---
Oh I didn't even notice thanks lol! I like power DPS DH a lot, easy to play, lots of damage with just enough cleave. The [condition damage firebrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/) is also really good whenever you can kill mobs and reset your F1. Both [power](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand) and condi (and also heal: [fractal](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Support_Healer)/[raid](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/heal/)) can also run as quickness sources for a group too with minimal gear or build changes (you need 0 boon duration to cover full quickness in fractals or in raids with a chrono).
---
So then O'brian definitely couldn't make a new GW game without them signing off on it.
---
iirc bungie was a very tight ship while under microsofts thumb, so tight in fact that while they did release great games and were profitable they longed for freedom, they longed for freedom so much that they left microsoft and went straight to daddy activision and gave us the mediocre yet surprisingly profitable hits such as destiny and destiny 2.
---
&gt;You lose no gear
---
You're right, the misinformation is insane. Just like you seemingly saying people think you lose the gear is part of that insane misinformation, since no one is saying that.

The really early perma tools all had the same animation as the regular tools, so it's just swing! Chop! Whatever.

Account-wide legendary unlock is not realistic at all. Your suggestion means that one legendary Greatsword covers all of your alts and every possible build template permutation you play with them for a nominal gold fee...
---
The issue with the economy right now is not gold, it is material overabundance. Crafting new legendaries or new Ascended weapons for alts addresses this. Grinding a flat cost of 50 gold does not.
---
That's the problem when anet makes a single class OP.
---
Guardian is literally an actually monopoly class  - Support (Pve/PvP/WvW)- DPS Power Support - DPS Condi Support - Power DPS -Condi DPS. In all modes he's too easy to use and too strong.
---
This is why im laughing about this. Everyones complaining about the gemstore factor ofbthe build templates when 99 percent of people use 2 to 3 builds each class anyway. Just looking for something to complain about.

Gaile literally told me I have no business being in the forums if I don't agree to everything people say to me. She was anything BUT a sweetheart.

Nope she stifled the community.

They were considering allowing people to make blank legendaries back when they started doing crafted legendaries. Maybe they could revisit that idea. Sell a replica recipe to anyone who has crafted one. The recipe would have to be moderately expensive, but be a good discount from going through the whole thing. It would probably have to have several of the Gifts the original required.
---
One day we'll be able to literally throw money at our screens.
---
This isn't true. NCSoft doesn't just publish the game, they own ArenaNet. ArenaNet is a subsidiary of NCSoft. If NCSoft decided tomorrow that they wanted to build a GW3, they could give the IP to some random other studio to build it. At least that is my understanding. In other words, NCSoft could shut down ArenaNet tomorrow and they still own the IP.
---
Bungie is not a subsidiary of Activision to the best of my knowledge.
---
I thought I had. The reason is this:
---
The risk of making the level of changes to achieve what a subset of players want is greater than the value that would be achieved by making those changes. Specifically the risk to the rest of the player base is greater than the value it would bring the players that want the change.

---
&gt;ncsoft aren't stupid
---
NCsoft shut down City of Heroes, despite the fact it was still quite profitable.
---
There's risk mitigation and risk avoidance. Sometimes the best option is to avoid the risk. In this case the risk was too great to mitigate effectively as the potential impact (entire player base) is too great for the potential benefits (Appealing to a small percent of the player base). The current, running application prevent certain interactions within the application, the only solution would be to change the DB schema and/or change architecture of the application. How do you mitigate that risk? 
---
Realistically, you can't truly mitigate that risk effectively as there's no way to test the effect of the change until said change goes live, at which point it's too late to prevent an outage if it does happen. Add to that the fact that a rollback is downtime as the database will have to be rolled back to an older schema as well. Such an outage would be far more disastrous than upsetting a small amount of players. Not all players/customers will notice/care about the limitations of the Build/Gear templates, but **ALL** **players** will notice an outage that takes hours to days to rollback
---
Does warframe have rpg elements or is it mainly a shooter?
---
&gt; ArcDPS templates work by intercepting and hacking things into the client. You know, the kind of thing that Man in the Middle attacks and malware also does. We're lucky deltaconnected was able to get ANet on-board with his templates. It would've been bad design and especially bad engineering to have done an ArcDPS in the game.
---
Which is irrelevant since we're talking about if the first party took over and strictly implemented the functionality the third party provided.  They wouldn't have to hook or inject their own code because they compile the code in the first place, and all of that is predicated on the idea that that's only done by malicious actors and not, say, your discord overlay or a myriad of other programs.
---
&gt; See my response above. ArcDPS is a hack and really not a good idea. There's a reason it's marked as "Use at your own risk". It's intercepting calls and changing them. Never a good thing to do. "just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should!"
---
Again, I'm working off an example that wouldn't require Anet to intercept anything, because *they control both ends here*.  Even if the concern were a malicious client, that wouldn't be any different a concern than it is now, so what are you on about?
---
&gt; They can't if the existing application architecture, or database schema, or network architecture (if applicable) doesn't allow it. It was made pretty clear that Gear -&gt; Inventory -&gt; Character. 
---
And yet here's a group that, whether you agree with their angle or not, has managed it with no issues.  ArcDPS templates are portable.  They're stored client side, the responsibility falls on the user to move them from one install to another, but they meet that criteria.  Every counter you're throwing at me here is predicated on the idea that a solution has to be completely embedded in the giant tangle of code server side, and I'm pointing out that it doesn't, there's a functional if workaroundy implementation of something with portable templates client side, and there's not much reason Anet couldn't have followed a similar path with respect to what is client side and what is server side.  They chose not to.
---
&gt; Until you work on a complex monolith application spread across multiple systems, you won't get it. This is not some "change a few lines of code over here" type of thing. Your comment about d3d9 and cpu performance shows how little you understand about how technology works. Just like how ArcDPS is a hack for templates, d3d12proxy and d9vk are hacks that simply take d3d9 calls and translate those calls into d3d12 and vulkan calls respectively - rewriting the engine to use d3d12 or vulkan is not so simple (BTW - vulkan and d3d12 have more in common with each other than d3d9 and d3d12 do). d3d12 and vulkan operate on a completely different architecture than d3d9 does.
---
That's a nice long rant that assumes I was being dismissive about what a challenge those two issues would be- and I wasn't.  They would be very difficult and costly issues to sort out, and my point was that it would still be worth the trouble because this game has been live for the better part of a decade on an engine that's older than that decade, and they still want it to be profitable against the competition- competition that's been around longer and still managed to do more at that level.
---
On top of that, dxvk is a potential opportunity to build on significant work and refine the rest of the game just to play nice with dxvk/proton, and maybe save money instead of a total overhaul.
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah ok. You know what's been more consistent than all those threads for the past seven years? Threads predicting the game's death.
---
Try again later
---
You still wont answer...why is that a risk that they are avoiding? What about adding more templates brings up that risk? Even though they are no more than strings of text. Why is there a risk involved with implementing what arcDPS does? Couldnt they examine it all up and down for vulnerabilities and then address those and deliver it wrapped up in a nice matching UI?
---
Because money; they're a corporation, they like that shit.

Hell, even Minecraft is terrible on touch screen.

Warframe now has an amazingly unique and well written story and it feels so good. If you haven't done so already, play Warframe at least through the Second Dream quest. I haven't gotten feels in a video game like that since the closing cinematic of Warcraft 3

Warrior sword is meta for condi, has a very typical thrust-and-leap sword setup that plays into the warrior feel, it's good fun.

Weaver has great animations and a flowing feel to the gameplay because you have so many skills, so you could give elementalist a shot.
---
Hard to have positive discussion in a game that only gets worthwhile content every 3-odd months.
---
city of heroes was a different game and not related to gw2 at all, it isn't relevant to how they handled gw2 as they were quite lenient with anet until they realised that they had started to just do the bare minimum required, even less than that at times. the fact is that anet is the cause of the problems, not ncsoft.
---
What is “bns_config?” Is it a duplicate of config.ini? I have custom configurations for config.ini. So I hope it doesn’t interfere.
---
Especially when they are always making sure to pump out new gemstore options. And especially when the oft demanded build templates feel like just another gemstore option.
---
Alt+shift+H then try other keybinds to spawn windows?

Isn't wvw stats for lvl 60 player?!

Anyway doesn't meter is it a reset night or not, if server full it fill in any day, you just need to wait if one day there is a spot for you. OR if your server get link with ps.
---
&gt; instead of being one of the most angry, vile, and hateful people I've seen yet far.
---
You haven't been on the internet very long, have you?
---
&gt;I mean, I understand your point, "players are going to choose to buy it or not based on if they find it worth X money." But what I'm saying is that Anet isn't going to choose a "lower than what they think the player will think it's worth" price, meaning that since they're selling two types of templates they're essentially double dipping. 
---
I don't see that as the goal though. I see it as there being two completely separate systems, mechanically separate not by intent, but just because that's how they originally designed the underlying systems (ie the one template interacts with traits and the other with gear), and that each provides a different value to the customer, so why *not* let customers pick and choose which they prefer?
---
ArcDPS's system worked by the nature of what it was working with, it was a UI interaction that just equipped and unequipped a bunch of stuff based on the same controls available to the player. The ANet solution is more integrated into the game itself, where those two systems are unconnected, and involve different portions of the code.
---
yeah I press left alt+shift+any letter, nothing
---
1. They are avoiding the risk because any potential issue, including a potential *outage of the game*, would affect all users, not just some.
---
2. Sharing Gear Templates between characters and other players is a problem due to relationships in how the database stores data about gear, characters, and item ownership prevents things like character sharing and account sharing. To allow sharing, they'd have to change the very schema of the database and architecture of parts of the game. The risk there would be that it risks the very integrity of the data stored for a character and/or account.
---
   1. While the templates appear to you to be only text, they are definitely *not* stored that way within the database. Just an FYI.
---
3. ArcDPS intercepts calls made by the game client to change the character build. Doing this risks integrity of the game client. While issues have been few and far between, the risk remains that such a hack could crash/break the game client, accidentally delete data, etc. All it takes is ONE bug. Better for ANet to work within their API rather than hack something that goes around it, in fact many systems actively prevent access outside of the established API. All about data integrity.
---
4. One I didn't think of earlier, but because ANet takes payments over the Gem Store, there is some level of regulation on how they store that data. They probably *can't* build a tool like ArcDPS without failing something like a SOC2, PCI, or other regulatory audit. Letting deltaconnected publish his with a warning about "Using at your own risk" probably circumvents such regulations. Also, we won't know which regulations they fall under as that is usually restricted information anyway.
---
Just because it's available doesn't mean it's good...
---
weird flex but ok.
---
&gt;	Just because they could do it with ArcDPS does not mean they can do it with the game itself without it being too expensive to make.
---
Speaking as a developer in general, this makes no sense. 
---
It would be neither expensive to code, or expensive to store. Especially if the data was held client side like GW1 templates were (for build templates).
---
The reason some of us can categorically state this fact is that we have similar experience in the field of software development.
---
You have no clue what you're talking about. 
---
Berserker is one of the squishiest and most vulnerable specs in the whole game, which is exactly why it isn't good.
---
This usually applies to any game with a ranked system, especially the esport ones. The #1 pro tip any player can tell you is to never say a word in ranked pvp games.  
---
That can backfire though because I tried this in LoL, and got a 2 week suspension for "toxic behavior". Apparently not engaging with your team is grounds for dismissal and a reportable offense, but their website says the best way to counter toxicity is to mute.....
---
Yeah I'm pretty wary of a subreddit that's operated by a company, no matter which company that is. That being said, I have my doubts they'll be the ones moderating later on.
---
Additionally it will probably get overshadowed by the subreddit for whatever their first game is, assuming said game takes off.
---
&gt;I never even saw him coming

Except bank tabs are also a thing that exists.  Anything that is in a bank can be moved to a single character and vice-versa.  The database and disparate system reason you are giving doesn't pass the smell test.  Shared inventory wasn't a thing until it was.  This could still be a thing... and they'd have a better shot at monetizing this (like shared inventory) than they will build slots.  Most people aren't going to use more than the 3 per character, lets be real.  But a system that allows us to more easily share gear between characters?  Yeah, that's something I would pay for.
---
What you commented here, is exactly the "sentiment" OP is expressing. You don't like quaggan posts, OP doesn't care about you needing more than 3 builds on one toon. Both sides have been expressing this for a long time back and forth. Neither is a winner. 
---
To OP, Ideally, the subreddit should moderate itself. The players who crafted legendary and have multiple builds have been shafted. They will complain. They must. The official forum is no use. #isajoke. This is their last bastion to raise voice and concerns. That shouldn't be taken away. Bundling them all under one thread is akin to brushing it under carpet.
---
I do have experience in software development, and it doesn't pass the smell test.  Sorry.  Like if a client came to me and said "can you do this" and I told them "nope, disparate systems, databases, yadda, yadda, yadda" they would find another person for the job.
---
Strengthening my point yes
---
What? No you're being delusional lmfao
---
Because money corporations... Blah blah my ass
---
&gt; Yes. We are specifically talking about a situation in which you use neither effect, while having the possibility of being able to use both.
---
No, we're talking about a situation where you have specifically used it and received neither effect. There is no more "possibility", you used the skill and nothing happened. You didn't break a stun, and you didn't blind someone.
---
&gt; A skill that only has a targeted effect an no other effect won't ever be on that situation.
---
So? The point is you're inputting the command to use a skill in a situation where it would do nothing.
---
Not to mention that legendary gear was already the "solution" to bag space. And without gear templates (via arcDPS) it was even a quality of life "degradation" since you have to click (and scroll) a lot more to change the stats. With multiple gear sets you only need ONE click per item, with legendary gear it can vary quite a lot AND you have to remember which stats to put on which item.
---
I have 13 meta builds between 9 characters and will have to buy a total of 0 slots. It's inaccurate and detrimental to conductive criticism of the feature to claim anyone playing multiple aspects of the end-game are going to be required to purchase extra slots or "miss out". It's simply not the case.
---
Dungeons start at 30 and unlock more as you level. If you do look for groups for them, I'd suggest making your own group and mentioning that you are new and looking for help. Fractals will up level you but are really designed for level 80 5 man groups. Fractals scale up in difficulty though so the low tiers are all pretty easy. Raids are 10 man fights that expect you to have a [proper build](https://snowcrows.com) (with at least level 80 exotic gear).
---
I have some [tips on leveling](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Leveling) if you're interested but mainly you should be on the look out to group up with people doing events. Also if you haven't looked already, you might want to try and find a guild to play with and run around together.
---
PvP gear templates aren't coming yet because it uses a seperate gear system (No gear at all).
---
That's why you have 3 build templates (for PvE, PvP and WvW) and only 2 gear templates (for PvE and WvW).
---
ArenaNet : You can have the feature for free by saving your builds in a text document and copy pasting them in chat.
---
Community : That's too expensive!
---
are they shootable?
---
'5. Do the easy dailies while on Sandswept isles.
---
What if they're not even balloons... But rather invisible rabbits?
---
Not without the rifles, I'd assume. They can be shot during the event while you're on them and you still don't fall.
---
Oh no... Thems' some big rabbits!
---
Yup. Sadly I think they don't.
---
One should either ignore the writing for Guild Wars 2 or set his/hers expectations really, really low. If you want good storytelling, play the original *Guild Wars* or read the books. The only decent writing that this game has ever seen was all the way back in 2014 with the release of LW2.
---
Lol this one made me laugh
---
Anet doesn't even need to compromise anymore than they already did. By allowing templates to be loaded from chat, they have made it piss easy to develop a third party tool that will support more build templates.
---
And this negative attitude is a reflection of the frustration players have with Arenanet's failure to grow this game like it could have been. This is a feature that LITERALLY SHOULD HAVE LAUNCHED WITH THE GAME and we're supposed to be excited about paying money for it? This is the bare minimum that's acceptable and it's nearly a decade late.
---
Your forge is faster than mine :O
---
That's not the part that's a problem. I'll personally develop a tool for *that* if nobody gets to it before me.
---
Gear templates are the problem. They cannot be pasted to chat or out of the game, and you cannot transfer them between characters. You can also only have 6 per character, and that's if you buy 4 of them.
---
To be clear, you shouldn't read any connotation into this; I'm nit stating an opinion, just relaying what people are upset about.
---
I would build a little app where you just click a button to save a template from your clipboard and then it makes a button you can click to put it back. Throw some filters on there and it's almost as easy to use as the in-game one. Something like... 6 clicks to swap out the whole build template. Four keypresses in addition, if you need to alt-tab.
---
It's limited because Anet themselves can't figure out how their game engine works with the inventory system anymore.
---
Aaaah that makes sense. You make very good points.
---
It does, indeed, suck.
---
I really hope that anet sees the plight of the people affected by this and works to find a solution that more closely matches what the community is ~~screaming~~ asking for.
---
Also, super respect to you for being able to know how bad this is but still accept that it may actually be out of anet's hands at this point.
---
Update it.
---
Sad to see another one go knowing the games from the roots :(
---
Still best of luck for your future projects! o/
---
...doesn't everyone have their minimap on the bottom right?
---
"It doesn't affect me personally so it's not a problem."
---
Wait...is Gaile why everyone says kitten instead of cuss words?
---
"It affects me personally so it's a problem for everyone."
---
The add-on needs to be updated every major patch that affects inventory and items. If the developer does not release an update after the patch it will not work. No updates will be done to build templates once the official ones are released; no need to ban people for a non-functional add-on.
---
I have 45 characters kitted out as my build templates because I didn't care for ArcDPS.  However, it's an objective fact that if you want to multiclass and play the meta builds for PvE while also working around the extra stats Fractal Pots give you, there's not going to be enough gear and trait slots to simply have one of every class.  You'll need up to 11 characters for that.  If you add WvW, it's up to 13.  Start adding your own builds within it and it becomes problematic.
---
There are variants of those builds. Not everything is blob fights, a meta build can be shifted depending on the situation your server is in. If you run that 1 copy pasted build and never read the "optional" skills and traits listed for different situations, you can be weaker even if you have the meta.
---
Lmao. What a fucking dumb thing to say. You really can't see the idiocy in that statement can you?
---
You also already expended a fair bit of resources be it gold or straight up money for gems to acquire those character slots to swap your builds.
---
In GW1 it is top right, so maybe some GW1 vets had swapped it to top right early on? There's a setting for that, right?
---
&gt;However, it's an objective fact that if you want to multiclass and play the meta builds for PvE while also working around the extra stats Fractal Pots give you, there's not going to be enough gear and trait slots to simply have one of every class
---
Uh, actually false. You can have one optimized Soulbeast cDPS build for Raids and one optimized Soulbeast pDPS build for Fractals, adjusted as needed for extra crit based on your AR. Same can be applied to a Scourge Heal Raid build and Power Reaper Fractal (boonrip), D/D Lotus cDPS and Staff Daredevil, etc. Multiple classes each filling multiple roles with meta builds between Raids and T4's.
---
Again, that's just assuming you're using the completely FREE version of Templates. I think it would do everyone some good to think of it like Bank Storage Tabs; most people won't ever exceed what is given, but for those who do there are ways to unlock FURTHER convenience either through in-game currency OR real world money.
---
Jason Schrier's expose on Bioware was an amazing piece of work.
---
Yeah, I've been doing hearts and a bit of personal story at the beginning. But the world feels kinda empty and its really spaced out. Not sure if it's because I don't have the latest expansion (maybe everyone are on those maps?) I'm currently in the area around Queensdale (I think it's one area after that)
---
Gaile Gray was the head Community Manager before she got laid off in February, she's the only Anet employee with an associated mini as well. :(
---
Yeah you can certainly move it. I did move mine to the top initially but aesthetically it works so much better in the bottom so I got used to it. 
---
But yeah its kinda funny, I bet so many have moved it and played so much they forgot what the default is :D
---
If you change runes/sigils/infusions and traits, that is a certain amount of clicks, plus memorisation if many.
---
Templates are not only convenience, they're also an extension of memory, like a txt file.
---
This is especially true when micromanaging stats to the last point. Optimization goes far further than switching condi/power/heal/tank.
---
Congratulations. I have it too and is the one I loved more during crafting.exordium is cool but it just a collection of materials .
---
Gen 2 with story are best legendaries
---
I am glad you like my cat, he does crazy stuff while I play like just suddenly sit on my mouse or meow directly into the mic while streaming .
---
I landed on it during the event, clinging onto the side until after the balloons disappeared. However, I wondered if I could actually land on top of it while it was invisible. So I kicked off with the skyscale, hovered in air until the still invisible balloon came back around, and then landed on it.
---
Generally, you can stand on things that have despawned and float there until you move, at which point the game registers that the object is no longer there and you fall. In this case though, the balloon still did it's little circuit through the air while it was "gone" and still counted as a physical object.
---
I tried it a couple times, and it worked on multiple balloons. It was pretty funny just floating around up there when the event came back on. Everyone was frantically trying to shoot them out from under me just to find out that I didn't fall down XD
---
I totally see the idiocy; it was a flip of perspective on your sarcastic remark.
---
I'm not saying it's not very important due to me personally not being negatively impacted by it. Rather, it's not very important because most people in most situations will not feel pressured to purchase additional slots, and even fewer people will feel as though they require more than the purchase-limit allows.
---
Oh yeah, another thing: **The baseline is completely FREE and is already beyond what we currently have without third-party tools!** Nobody is *losing* anything, some people just feel like they deserve more than what they are being given, which is where the **entitlement** comes in.
---
I thought the GW2 UI was pretty much locked into place. Resize the chat and move windows around sure, but I didn't know you could move the minimap.
---
In that case, bottom right corner minimap gang. Been that way for 7 years, ain't gonna change it now. I actually change other games' UI to put the minimap on the bottom right whenever I can, because of GW2.
---
I love this. Reminds me of Fantastic Beasts and where to find them.
---
&gt;Change my mind
---
I don't see a reason to, if you're that dead-set on it.
---
Personally I don't have the time nor patience to minmax, but mostly I'm just too lazy. I perform well enough without infusions and getting that little precision/ferocity/whatever stat, or swapping out gear to cap a stat and I'm satisfied.
---
Its forfanbyfans, endorsed by arenanet, theres tons of guild wars 2 merch their.
---
I run more than one build and change them by hand. Arcdps will never work on my computer. So... I have some empathy with the arcdps people, but don't overdo it please.
---
You're beating up on strawmen - and no, you do not *need* the build templates, I can play without them. That means "wait 2 minutes, I have to swap gear and traits" before every boss.
---
What’s your stream? :)
---
&gt; Nobody is losing anything,
---
I mean this is just objectively not true. Me, personally, if I wanted to keep the same functionality I have right right now, would lose something in the realms of $100 USD.  
---
You dismissing this very real monetary cost aimed at other players of the game with such flippant disregard isn't just stupid it's malicious.
---
I don't know why, but for some weird reason I like pictures of screens with games on it. When it's an actual photo, not a screenshot.
---
Kinda reminds me of that old GW2 gamescom videos I watched over and over again before release.
---
unless ur having fun wiping others in raids/fractals/pvp nobody cares
---
No problem :P
---
the only truth here is that you are racist
---
A smartphone is not a phone. It is a computer with added telephone functionality. You can buy one and use all of its functionality except calling perfectly fine without any phone company's involvement.
---
Sure, not a lot of people do that, because being able to call people and have mobile internet on your personal pocket computer is very convenient. But saying a phone contract is required is a bit of a stretch.
---
&gt; of guild wars 2 merch their
---
It's their merch, all right.
---
So you said a "guy". Then you said "they" refering to a guy. I don't even understand the purpose of if anymore.
---
 Ha ha exactly. The Boar/pig glider skin was about as close to a parachute as I could get, but decided against it for being too cartoony.
---
arcdps' template add-on was allowed to exist until anet releases their own solution. They might not be able to detect it bud good luck finding public version.
---
If there aren't other projects being developed then long term it doesn't look good for Anets future. Short term wise I think GW2 will keep plodding along.
---
Without expansions I think a lot of people will lose interest, but will still have a high enough population to survive. Personally I don't have much faith in the living world.
---
Medium term I think GW2 will still be around. The only thing is I think recently wih the layoffs, and confirmation that an expansion isn't being worked on GW2 fans have to temper our expectations. Feels a bit like Gw2 has moved down a category from the big 4 or 5 MMORPG's and we can't expect the same sort of content updates they get.
---
TLDR: Things a bit shaky for Anet, but I think GW2 will keep on keeping on.
---
Wow!. Thank you for the detailed reply! and time taken to make it.
---
I really appreciate this.
---
LOL.  Then don't respond to my thread.
---
You seem to understand things the way I do.
---
Nobody here but you mentioned Mord's magic making Aurene's egg hatch and that's clearly what happened. 
---
We know for sure that Primordus got a fair share of Mord's power, we know that Jormag got a tiny portion of Mord's magic too. So we can't really say that Aurene replaced the Jungle Dragon. Saying that she replaced Zhaitan (many others here say that) is even more incorrect.
---
EDIT: Check my reply to your other post please.
---
Any soloable builds for elem.?
---
Oh the bear... still thinking of one
---
Would be an okish solution for a part of the problem.
---
But gear blueprints would be a *lot* easier to implement, and adds more QoL for obtaining Legendary gear. 
---
(If your curious on how they could work: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dcn35w/gear_blueprints/)
---
Funny, right?
---
Can you link it for me? Top seems to have changed, and with a quick glance over the comments I couldn't find it :/
---
bahahaha ... it was easier than I thought. I crafted Casava flower till 440 and [Quiche of Darkness Vegetable Mix](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Quiche_of_Darkness_Vegetable_Mix) till 500
---
Honest question: how do you guys deal with cats and your computer stuff? I'm thinking about adopting a cat from a shelter but Im also afraid he might bite out every little wire I have because not only I will lose a lot of money that I no longer have but the little guy might get hurt. How do you deal with it?
---
&gt;Are you really trying to tell me they don't have another income source....?
---
I never said that. All I said is that they still need to make money and that the income trough expansion falls flat due to their decision to not release one. Besides that, there probably is a reason for them to come up with all the new ways to make money which until now only included skins and not gameplay features (which is still free ofc but heavy limited).
---
look at all the replayability
---
Very cute kitty ♥️♥️ just curious what specs are you running GW2 with? CPU and GPU
---
So are we flooding reddit with cat pics now? 
---
Don't make me start posting my 6 cats. Every 3 hours.
---
You expect a 5 man Indie Studio to create a MMORPG to not only rival GW2 which 200 people spent a decade working on but trump it?
---
They will most probably start by creating some puzzle mobile game. Perhaps involving RPG elements and Characters. If I was to make a wild guess I would take a gamble at some sort of Tactical RPG.
---
Looking forward to it, the mobile market is a marsh filled with a few golden nuggets and these are people I would imagine put their passions quite high when creating something.
---
That being said. This is a New Studio, and their prime objective now have to be to create something that allows them to not only earn a living, but preferably also allows them to create more ambitious projects in the future.
---
I’ll check you out when I get the chance, gl with the streaming :)
---
Wow, you really make it all sound that Arenanet is some sort of evil corporation with a-holes working there.
---
You all choose to use negativity to word the issues at hand and issue verbal attacks towards the staff/company while instead a simple:
---
 "There seems to be a scaling error with the new chair, would you please look into this?" would address the issue and be polite at the same time.
---
The Way you talk to people is generally the way you will be treated by them.
---
People are amped up for some reason and it is getting very tiresome :(
---
Please all take a deap breath and rethink your strategy, for all our sakes.
---
&gt; yelling "take my money"
---
for build templates feature, not the "hey you changed a trait" - pay now to save it.
---
Oh cute, looks like mine who also played with me... Now he's dead. So never say never.
---
Good idea
---
Rename this sub r/catsofgw2players
---
There is. Ahuge rifference between minimax and just suboptimal
---
Jez no. I just wait for it to finish and collect the amalgamated stone :)
---
You'll still be put in teams with people who care and try. 
---
If you don't care about PvP just don't play, but don't purposefully hinder your teammates' chances.
---
That's a very toxic behavior.
---
arc will be discontinued once official templates are out
---
This is too good! :D
---
It was the besy age to be a fan of Guild Wars 2. I really don't understand why Anet is trying so hard on not doing the same again. Ot totally worked.
---
There will still be people who are new or just bad in lower PvP tiers or low Fractals who are trying to learn and improve.
---
Who are you to decide on their behalf how important the match is?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1cKM-_CKno
---
I am very happy for you and everyone that will benefit from these templates, but why not join us and fight for templates that are great for everyone and might benefit you even more should you ever change ur way of playing the game!
---
My cat decided that my keyboard is a specially designed throne for him to sit on while I play games
---
Again, the vast majority of people won't even benefit from spending more than just a few bucks. Very few people play 50+ builds, even fewer play them effectively.
---
What does the vast majority lose if the system is fair to anyone?
---
I think that's why people try new games. If you manage to find a new game that clicks it will give you that feeling you had just like you had when you first started Gw2, Gw1, WoW, etc. Because it's all new, there's no worries about the future of the game, endgame, mtx (usually). Often an expansion gives this same feeling to a lesser extend.
---
&gt;Honestly I think people "care" because they just like whining about things.  
---
Wrong. And insulting to people like me, who it actually effects.  
---
&gt;"You won't lose much"  
---
I lose $100 USD if I want to regain the same functionality. "Not much".  
---
&gt;I still stand by the fact that the vast majority of players will not feel restricted by a cap.  
---
And now we come full circle. "It doesn't affect me, so it's not a problem."  
---
So, in reality, you only "care" because you're a shill who thinks anet's decisions are above criticism, and that there is no place for discourse, and attack anyone who dares challenge them with snide remarks and half-baked arguments. You believe we should accept blindly everything they do, and shut up and take it. You're what is called, in simple terms, a fanatic, and you desperately need some cynicism in your life before a worse company fucks you over harder.
---
Nice comic.
---
Now you need to make more. And more. And more. Now.
---
Butthurt is butthurt, might wanna pull that pole out.
---
My "problem" is that I always come back to GW2. It just has so many QoL features that other games don't have and once you try to go without it, you realize how much you actually loved it.
---
I tried playing ESO and enjoyed it for quite some time and it was nice to not worry about anything for a while, but after the first levels that whole "Is this the right class/race"-thinking came back to me. Probably something more general than related to GW2.
---
If you were looking to discuss the big problems that trouble mankind you prolly shouldn't look for them in a game subreddit
---
You have to be level 31 to equip elite skills.
---
If you can't equip at level 31 and you are sure you have access to it, contact support.
---
Judging the recent events and the past ArenaNet entered GW1 into this prologue tier mode and delivered only living story episodes before releasing GW2 and stopping development in gw1 all together. The same thing is happening with GW2 now, but there are two speculations. 
---
The first one is positive and that is that ArenaNet actually finished GW3 and is within a year or a year and a half before releasing it so GW2 is at its end. And of course War Eternal episode was a huge giveaway that GW2 has came into a conclusion.
---
Now the second one is that GW2 indeed came into a conclusion with War Eternal and they wanted to release GW3 but with all past layoffs ArenaNet had to scrap its project and now salvaging everything into GW2 in form of episodes. If that is true then NCsoft Earning release of Q3 will quite enlightening with how GW2 is doing. Spoiler alert, not doing as good as you think.
---
thanks a lot for your elaboration.
---
I am not into raiding, as my playtime unfortunately  does not allow for organized groups with fixed dates.
---
I enjoy fractals a lot and am sitting on ascended berserker + vipers gear for light and heavy armor + lots of legendary weapons.  Was thinking of converting the heavy viper gear to diviner, although I enjoy condition builds for Ren and FB.
---
From gw2 efficiency I get the impression, that those grandmaster marks would be the way to go cheapest and probably fastest if I would consider crafting/getting new one. Crafting with Serpentine Jewls would also consume a lot of Laurels for the recipes as it seems.
---
How long will it take before Redditors rage for a roadmap there?
---
I don't think devs ever said that runes/sigils would be "good for build templates", that's what some people in the community said. Legendaries were always about being able to freely change the stats. Being able to do it freely with keybind would be great, but that wasn't part of the deal when I was making mine. So I don't expect it to work like that.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I still stand by the fact that the vast majority of players will not feel restricted by a cap.    
---
   
---
&gt;And now we come full circle. "It doesn't affect me, so it's not a problem."  
---
I guess you missed the part where I said "vast majority"? Seriously, if you can't argue on logic and have to resort to personal insults maybe it means you don't have a valid leg to stand on. Best of luck in your adventures
---
Seriously, thanks a bunch. This’ll probably all be very useful eventually.
---
I wasn’t sure I was interested in Revenant when it came out, so I didn’t look into it much. How does it generally play compared to Warrior and Guardian?
---
Nope, it's already against ToS, just got special treatment.
---
What is the fucking point of these threads? What good does it make for you share this other random GW2 players? You want us to node in agreement and reply to you with "Saaaaame dude!" or "Wow man your literature god!" I mean seriously what are you trying to accomplish here?
---
This is something for yourself to think back and forth, as in your post you are talking to yourself. You are like an old man in his 80s waiting to die and is talking to his grandkids .
---
Thanks, I love this!
---
The wiki seems pretty clear on the fact that you shouldn't have it.
---
*The skill is automatically available to level 31 characters for owners of the Digital Deluxe or Collector's Edition of Guild Wars 2.*

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistfire_Wolf
---
IMO you should've added more diverse background sceneries (like maybe some PoF and LW5 maps, a worldboss,  etc.). The ending however was great, I like how you made every other race join and enter combat like a badass group.
---
Hmmm... mobile game, the paradise of micro transactions.
---
"lol haha who cares joke pvp" but you are doing your best, so I guess I misinterpreted your words.
---
To add to what the others have said: If you’re a revenant, you can’t equip the mistfire wolf skill either.
---
"Notice me, senpai."
---
Ah, yes. Fun gameplay.
---
Exactly.
---
Holy shit. This was an absolute delight to watch, incredible job! As soon as the voiceover started I knew I was in for a treat.
---
What is this? A chair for ANTS?
---
I think the technical limitation may be that that the inventory space thing was the most practical way to implement the templates in their infrastructure.
---
Who needs /wave if jumping over a friend is much easier faster and simpler than any greetings ceremony people do with their hands.

Can't say I'm 100% sure on your issue, but I'd honestly recommend just giving up on gw2hook and swapping over to reshade. Yes, gw2hook has some nice features for gw2 that reshade doesn't but it seems like the creator of gw2hook has abandoned it and it's not compatible with any of the other nice addons that are coming out. I know dx12pxy in particular doesn't work with it, which I highly recommend trying if you haven't already.
---
I can actually identify with this image. I mean, just imagine being an elitist in this fucking game. 
---
A game so simplistic and casual that it has a whopping 2 different damage types, completely streamlined gear and no skill resource management. A game where getting Zerker gear and mashing buttons off cooldown is sufficient for literally all the content. 
---
It's like getting overlays and scripts to optimize your Candy Crush gameplay. It just feels so ridiculously out of place.
---
Is arcDPS the new GWToolbox ?
---
i do my best but still pvp is a joke with bots and afks and cheaters. u cannot take it seriously. you should just play to have fun. hope to have one cool duel or two , some nice fight but winning or losing is not something depending on how much u take it seriously so why bothering with a meta which means nothing with its current state?
---
tx god someone still remember it.
---
For fractals it's not that Condi builds are out of the meta but more that they kinda never really were (or ant least not for at very very long time) because of the very short phases and the defiance bar mechanics. If you still want to play condi in Fractals, Condi Firebrand is probably the best pick because of the very quick ramp up, high power-condi split and the F1 refhresh when trash dies to spam even more of it :p (but then as a DPS DH would work even better).
---
The current general fractal usual support setup is:
---
* Heal Firebrand for Quickness, Might, some Fury and a bunch of defensive boons (or Power Quickbrand if you feel you really don't need a healer)
---
* Diviner Renegade for AP, Alacrity, the rest of the Might and Fury, CC and on-demand Stab or Boon rip
---
And yeah crafting Diviner is just a pain anyway even with [Stat changing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) in the Mystic Forge because of the gathering process for the base components.
---
You're only paying money if you need more than 3 builds. Find out which ones you rarely use or don't need and drop 'em.

its inevitable, Mr Anderson

What is the fucking point of these replies?

Thanks and I plan to make more. ;)
---
I am sure they test it with humans and then squish norn and charr model.
---
You can't play druid in raids or support firebrand in wvw with berserker gear.
---
That’s a weird charr you got there. 
---
Ps he/she is really cute

Don't forget puzzle games, e.g. The Room. That's a really good game.

I just did this with weaver for pvp. Never really played the class and it’s complex enough that I won’t master it anytime soon I’ve enjoyed throwing myself into the deep end with this one and have a reignited feeling to play this game after 7 years of slowly disconnecting from it!
---
At this point, Aurene has less than half of Mordremoth's magic. Even if the lion's hare of that 25% that went north went to Aurene and the Maguuma Bloodstone and through Balthazar and Kralkatorrik she has the lionshare of the Maguuma Bloodstone's magic, that's at most 20% because it didn't all go to those two things, and a ton of magic escaped Balthazar with the explosion.
---
And even if the lion's share of the eastern 25% went to Kralkatorrik, with so much distance it would have really spread out (and probably hit the Pale Tree in all honesty though this is never mentioned); we're probably looking at less magic going to Kralk than what went to Aurene+Maguuma Bloodstone. But let's be generous and say it's also 20%.
---
That means Aurene most likely has 40% of Mordremoth's magic **if** she took in Mordremoth's, Zhaitan's, and Balthazar's magic from Kralkatorrik.
---
If Balthazar took Mordremoth's magic from Primordus (again, zero indication), then we might then be looking at 60-65%. But still not 100%. Over a quarter of Mordremoth's magic is unaccounted for.
---
We'd hit the same numbers for Zhaitan's magic in Aurene **if** we assume that Zhaitan's magic split three ways, and that the majority of that split ended up in Mordremoth (via Scarlet's attack on LA), Kralkatorrik, and Primordus (via Ring of Fire movement). But since we know some went to Jormag and the Maguuma Bloodstone, we can only say "majority of the three hypothetical splitting". It's far more speculative because unlike with Mordremoth, we don't see Zhaitan's magic spread out into the world.
---
Even then, dev comments hinted at Kralkatorrik's magic not being perfectly consumed by Aurene, and we got [this icon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Mini_Icebrood_Saga_Ogre.png) and [upcoming miniature](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/443074920893775873/623908808892350464/unknown.png) that looks like Jormag getting some Branding abilities going on. So Aurene didn't even get 100% of Kralkatorrik's own magic, let alone the foreign magic Kralkatorrik consumed.
---
But even ignoring all that, if Zhaitan's and Mordremoth's orbs were still during Tiami's Simulation, when Primordus had a significant portion of both, why should we believe they're now active under Aurene when she has showed zero use of those domains?
---
Point being:
---
&gt; So we can't really say that Aurene replaced the Jungle Dragon. Saying that she replaced Zhaitan (many others here say that) is even more incorrect.
---
Is 100% correct.
---
You can play what you want if the others in your group agree or you play singleplayer games.
---
Thanks!
---
so tired of it tbh
---
Nothing's stopping you from keeping your gear in your bag. Sure it's a worse system than what Arc had but now we can know exactly what pugs are running.  
---
They also said they're open to expanding the system in the future. Right now you're use one of your templates if you're using a completely different build, not one that uses a few different pieces of armor
---
I'm sorry to hear that.
---
&gt; Also, remember when ANET wasn't helping hacked GW1 players restore accounts anymore?
---
No? Seeing as GW1 and GW2 accounts are the exact same thing I call fucking bullshit on this. They weren't able to access Gaile's GW2 account when they hacked the GW1 one (despite both sharing the same login and password) because her GW2 account had an authenticator that didn't protect the GW1 account. Restoring the account to her (changing the password) is something they would do for anyone able to verify they are the real owner of the account.
---
It was a support employee who made Gaile's account vulnerable in the first place, by doing something they weren't supposed to do to help someone pretending to be Gaile access her account by giving enough personal information to get a password reset (again, bullshit on your original claim because Gaile's account was lost specifically because support was still helping players with their accounts).
---
Even if they weren't helping players restore accounts (they were), it's really fucking obvious why an account known to belong to an ArenaNet employee and frequently used to make official appearances in-game, speaking on behalf of the company would be a high priority to restore it to the previous owner. The person who hacked her account was using the special mod powers it had (it couldn't create items but it did have access to specific map chat commands that are incredibly easy to abuse by impersonating an employee) so it was an urgent case of needing to act anyone.
---
But again, the entire reason the account was "hacked" in the first place was because support helped a person pretending to be Gaile to "regain" access to her account. It's also the same account as a GW2 account, so again, bullshit.
---
You don't have to run a min-maxed build, even in raids. What you need to run is a build that has at least a tiny bit of thought put into it

You don't need an official statement over the size of a freaking chair in-game. OMG. Are you people mentally ill? Get the refund if you want it, don't buy the chair if you don't like it, no-one else will see the misleading concept art, everything is fucking solved. There is no great abuse of power, no boogey man out to get you, no big bad corporation coming to make you homeless.
---
Concept art didn't match the product sold, within a few days it was changed and refunds were offered to unhappy people. The change was documented in the patch notes. For some reason this makes ArenaNet literally Satan.

I can't check the trait right now so I want to ask: does the Necro gain carapace for each stack of the condition they applied in a single instance (e.g. if Necro applies 3 stacks of Bleed in a single attack, does that yield 3 carapace stacks or only 1)?
---
If Necro receives carapace for each stack of condition they apply, then Dread in Spite may be a good way to get a burst of carapace stacks. It would require the Necro to give up Soul Reaping, but whatever.
---
These meltdowns are a group of miserable, malcontent conspiracy theorists trying to drag everyone else down with them. They actively seek out the outrage and they spread it as much as they can. The same handful of people are at the center of it, spreading conspiracy theories, bullshit, bad faith argument or just flat out spewing toxic bile at ArenaNet and their employees over the dumbest bullshit.
---
It's not a response to some kind of provocation or great wrong that ArenaNet has inflicted upon anyone, it's entitled gamers who lack perspective, social skills or a firm grip on reality to see how absurd they are being every time they pull this shit.
---
It's almost like public discussion boards are for people to discuss things on. Crazy shit, right?
---
I wake up, turn on the PC, look at Reddit on my phone... Surprise in my EYES! And then read the title lol. Good job you fooled me, it looks fantastic! xD

I’m using the HoT reaper build and it’s fantastic. Thanks so much. I’m almost done collecting the HPs I need :)

*Watership Down flashback intensifies*
---
Sure makes you wonder how ultimate that ultimate edition is when it doesn't even include the basic deluxe edition.
---
Well no matter, the only decent things in the deluxe edition are the heroic chest (which you can get anyway by giving to charity) and the Mistfire Wolf, and even then you'll only use the wolf to flex that you're willing to spend 2,000 gems on a short evening's worth of guild commendations and PvP rank points, a mini, a bank golem that dies after a couple of weeks and a pretty much purely aesthetic elite skill.
---
I object to that proposal because deleting piken square is akin to opening up the prisons and the madhouses.
---
Think of the children Jesus Christ!
---
I concur... Leave the apes in the apes house.
---
You're totally right, I completely forgot Rev existed. Add Rev to the list, it's a meta spec that definitely is fun for some and not for others, but if you like it it's great.
---
addons -&gt; arcdps -&gt; arcdps.ini
---
I gotta give my 2 cents here, sorry.
---
But, to me, **in my opinion only**, I feel it's unnecessary to have *all* the builds. It's not like I am going to play everything, or enjoy everything, so it doesn't matter ***to me***
---
But then again, I won't shove my opinion on others, but I can't say that having the free build slots is going to be something I'm going to complain. I'm not even sure if I'm going to use any of them at all.
---
I still think that pricing them at 600/800 gems is awful, and I would, at max, value them at 400 gems. And I'm saying at max, really, because I don't think it's worth that much at all.
---
I see now. It's confusing but with several assumptions we can make it work... somehow. Thank you!
---
You already got plenty of answers, but i would like to add the fact you can get special wvw ascendant trinkets (amulet, rings, accessories) which you can stat swap with some wvw currency.
---
I got the pvp ones, there are also pve version of them form the first episode if lws3 (the one in bloodstone fen)
---
The pve ones could be quicker to get but i didnt do the math
---
So if Aurene wasn't able to suck up Kralk's magic fully (assumption based on the mini) we might be in need of making plan B, C and D just in case in the upcoming story.
---
Commander sure has some hard times. And they must babysit Braham *sighs*
---
People can also swap ascended equipment between the characters and by your argument it means ascended items should be available account wide as well. Not sure why you feel you deserve a special treatment all of the sudden.
---
Also 50 gold "sink" helping the economy LOL
---
It took me a bit to get on top of one since the skyscale doesn't fly fast enough to easily catch up with them and maneuver to land on top.  
---
So I flew straight over the path of the closest one to the floor, and positioned the skyscale to drop on top of it with a single tap of the Mount Ability 2 key, and waited for it to arrive. 
---
When the target arrived, I dropped on top of it, and we started moving with it, and I got the interact prompt.
---
F, and the event progressed. It was pretty late and there was no one else in the copter platforms, so it had to be me. 
---
I do not know if it also counts towards the achievements, since I had it completed already. 
---
When the targets move you can also latch onto them with the skyscale and move around with them. This could be an interesting feature they could add for a jumping puzzle for skyscales: Latch onto moving wall plate, it would take you up father than the skyscale can reach.
---
you can, just smash your head against the wall and hope that you get a concussion and memory loss.
---
lemme know if it works, i wanna try it too
---
Yo Mr White, BITCH
---
My god, didn't think of this before! Thanks, will try soon.
---
I doubt it. Maybe later down the road they could add other separate caps, like bringing back the monthly cap, but for Quarterly achievements so there can be more variety in the achievements like all dungeon paths, all fractals, PvP and WvW seasons etc; or have some way for people who wasn't for S1 to get those AP and catch up with older players.  
---
But dailies will quite probably stay at 15K.
---
yess please this looks so cool I hope they change the launcher with ep 1
---
It haven't changed in 7 years, why would it change now?
---
So guys, I'm new here, currently at level 23, I'd like to get some tips because I'm just traveling from place to place grinding, not sure of what to do. 
---
And I'd like to know if is it better to craft or should I keep buying weapon and amor?
---
I have none of the dlc so a quick way to level up would be useful too. 
---
Build tips would be useful too. And any other things you guys think it would be important to know.
---
Right now I'm at The Thunderhorns trying to get to lions arch.
---
Word. A meta build you don't know how to play is much worse than an off-meta one you can play effectively.
---
Because people would maybe reach the limit. And anet maybe want to move that limit so that they can imrove their ap.
---
Not really because arc is officially allowed or tolerated
---
The simpler the game the closer you can get to „perfect“ gameplay. See chess

WoW is the only popular MMO that isn’t in a series of MMOs, or with planned sequels. Everquest had a sequel, Guild Wars had a sequel. Before FFXIV, there was FFXI. MMOs getting sequels isn’t an exception, it’s the rule.
---
“You're dumb. You'll die, and you'll leave a dumb corpse.”
---
I can think of quite a few sequels but I definitely wouldn't say that most MMOs get sequels.
---
Typical teef, you sneeze at them, they dodge..
---
If they don't add a new one, I'd at least like them to go back to the original launcher/music.
---
I've seen huge improvements (especially in FPS stability) in all games I play. Except GW. It's still jittery on fast camera movement, and any major city is just dipping down to 30ish FPS. I reeeeally doubt it has anything to do with the CPU :)  
---
For example, i just finished a world boss in WoW  - over 60 people on screen tossing all kinds of skills. Framerate never dipped a single frame under 60 FPS. Everything maxed out. Shaman in GW still kills it down to low 20ish fps while maxed AND player count down to minimum
---
I did the same thing, after 2 year break, made a necro which I always wanted and started enjoying the game again, now just need to find a casual guild!
---
&gt;“You're dumb. You'll die, and you'll leave a dumb corpse.”

Solid answer, good job. Don't forget to fix server's economy with 50 gold fee for a legendary clone.

---
GW2 needs a sequel because its balance and combat system is broken. Players literally do 10x more damage than others with just certain gear choices.
---
The only way to retroactively fix GW2 is to delete Berserker's Gear (and Viper's) from the game, and rebalance all gear sets to have 2 offensive attributes and 1 defensive attribute. Also, to delete Ferocity from the game.
---
Now, obviously what I'm saying here isn't popular. But that's exactly why we need a GW3. Any major overhauls to combat balance would drive people away from GW2. So it needs to be done in GW3.
---
edit: **By downvoting, you are proving my point**. This series needs a GW3 because any massive balance revamps would be unpopular.
---
Ironic. You talk about there being so much drama, yet here you are, adding to the pile. 
---
Let's be honest, perhaps you have some more pondering to do.
---
Average player do not get to the end of story in any game. Just look up on achievement statistic for any MMO, or single player game on Steam. Does it mean that game do not market itself as finished experience with fully developed systems? Because by that logic no need for finished games ever...
---
hello,
---
I'm gonna mostly talk about gems and you not being an altoholic.
---
gems always make gemstore purchases when something is on sale, unfortunately you just missed the best time to buy from the gemstore with the anniversary sales those happen around august 18th till the end of month most everything goes on sale during this period its just a matter of logging on the day its on sale to purchase it, character slots are the cheapest they will ever be during this sale.
---
 gemstore is all skins and qql stuff so really its up to you what you get for me the copper fed is a must have at this point after that its really up to you there are tons of things on there that make life better but its not needed.
---
pay gold for gems. what I do is a usually buy gems around april  may or june or when there are long content droughts and the gold to gems price is low the absolute worse time to buy gems for gold is from august to prolly around feb. the reason gold to gem prices are really high during this period is cause of the anniversary sales in august plus the Halloween and the wintersday events.the best times to usually get gems for gold is when content droughts happen but there is an exception, when a new expansion gets released with an ultimate version gives people 4000 gems. some people drop these gems for gold driving the gold to gem prices down and makes it a good time to buy.
---
now lets talk about you not being an altoholic.
---
MAKE ALL YOUR FREE CHARACTER SLOTS ASAP.
---
1.the number 1 reason to use all your character slots asap is birthday gifts, some are good some not so much but its all free stuff just for having a birthday.
---
2. Alt Parking for extra gold or mats. park alts at mats you need to harvest daily, or just to sell those mats you get. there are plenty of resources out there that tell you great places to park your alts.
---
3. Pack Mule even without the other 2 this reason alone is worth it, extra storage first starting out storage is hard, unless you pay lots of real life cash for gems and start buying all the storage stuff.
---
well that's my input.
---
That's actually a decent argument. But, in all fairness, I doubt it'd be much better in GW3.
---
My friend did the same. Then she got charged with static one day, what jumped and fried his 500$ LCD:-P
---
Because most of the MMOs weren't as successful,most of them died in 2yrs.
---
How can you guarantee GW3 won't die in 2 years?
---
I would say no and that it shouldn't.  I'm an achieve hunter in general, and it's good for my mental health that there be a cap and that I've reached it already.  If I miss a log in day I don't worry about it, instead of "oh man, that was a chance for 10AP! and I missed it!" Now I just didn't progress my log in rewards or do daily craft stuff which is no big deal.  The cap is a good thing.
---
So, when I started the video it stated episode 6. At which point I dropped my ohone and instantly logged into my computer in order to binge the whole thing.
---
Well played sir, this was awesome
---
lineage too
---
yes please, i would pay money for... wait.
---
I started playing GW2 again about 3 months ago and I've had a ton of fun getting back into the game and I've wanted to give my old characters some love!! You can check out some other stuff of mine on [my tumblr](https://stormhowler.tumblr.com/tagged/my%20art) including the first illustration I did of [my ranger](https://stormhowler.tumblr.com/post/187585385474/pose-credit-yay-its-done-fingers-crossed-it)! 
---
Not sure who to draw next, probably one of my charr cuz I got that Metal Legion hype!! \\m/
---
I just feel like it'd start bleeding players really quickly. It'd be popular for a few weeks and then disappear into oblivion. You might be right that there's a huge demand for a new MMO but the expectations are so high that it'd be really hard to meet them.
---
It's a nice mix. It's a 3rd person shooter, though you can exclusively do melee combat, with some nice rpg progression elements with your ability to mod your warframes and weapons. 
---
It is very much a grind game, a looter, whatever you want to call it but it's often compared to things like Diablo and POE in regards to the grind.
---
The story and lore for warframe are awesome! It takes a long while to actually get into the good story quests as the first 5 or 6 "planets" are more about the learning curve and that kind of stuff. You will have a story but it starts out a little underwhelming and doesn't really kick off till about Jupiter or Neptune depending on who you ask. If you are super interested in it I'd be willing to help you get your head on straight.
---
Sure why not? If I have no content in GW2 and it is Guild Wars time...
---
...Wouldn't the same be true for GW2, which is still one of the most popular MMOs out 7 years later?
---
Every game is a risk. MMOs in general are a risk.
---
I still do daily here and then. Not so many pvp dailys as doing 40 matches at one day made me take a break..
---
but I do mystic forge everyday, forester/miner mostly as well because a friend has a full home instance. I tend to get most wvw dailys by playing with the benefit of stacking the potions to instantly go through new reward tracks. 2g are a nice bonus as well
---
Feels bad to not get ap tho
---
I see it as a free +2g for doing a little pvp/wvw which I enjoy anyways :V
---
You're probably right. Honestly if I were Anet I'd take a good look at how all these older titles are being rereleased and doing well and I'd try to do something with GW1. Their resources as a company are rather limited now, but a project like releasing a polished version of GW1 PvP as a standalone with better monetization could still happen if they wanted to.
---
Play mesmer. Alternatively, play mesmer.
---
This sounds 100% accurate.
---
Yea i could but, the mesmer skill chains really throw me off. Like the butterfly effects. If I enjoyd making clones id be all over it but i am no fruity boy
---
Wow, that sounds like the biggest pile of crap I read in a while.
---
OP is proposing his ideas on a way to unfuck the harshness of build templates for people who can't use them because they invested their time in legendaries over ascended gear. And now you go on your big boy rant on how even DPS meters are bad ?
---
Go back to erping with your furry friends in the black citadel, I guess.
---
Subscribed!!!!
---
&gt; GW2 needs a sequel because its balance and combat system is broken. Players literally do 10x more damage than others with just certain gear choices.
---
how is a sequel going to magically fix that?
---
combat system is fine. Most encounter/mob design is kinda rubbish though.
---
Go play a game that actually has a good leveling experience like FFXIV.  GW2 leveling even when it was a brand new game was pretty terrible.  After you move on and play a game from a company that actually interacts with their community, actively improves existing systems, listens to player feedback, releases polished content, updates their game engine and more you won't miss GW2 at all.  I thought GW2 was the best MMO but after sampling some others in the last year and trying to go back and play GW2 it feels more like an Indy game by 3 guys in their basement.
---
I’ve seen ArcDPS say unavailable when trying to swap, but I’ve been able to change builds while running around in my group.
---
.... What? The whole reason for leaving is that he already had a new opportunity (new company in this case) lined up
---
Deter your cat hard from playing with cables from the start.  That saves the most problems. Honestly most cats don't care about wires but I had a cable chewer for a while and basically put the power strip in an organizer box and shielded with plastic tubing from there.  Only real issue then was solved when i got a cordless headset.
---
Make a space that is theirs on your desk. Between keyboard and monitor or between player and keyboard are good but they can be in the way.  I put a folded towel next to my mouse that became his spot.  Do not use their spot for other things. That is their spot. 
---
Other nests can be a small pet bed,  box,  or folded shirt with your scent.  Just remember this is their spot.  My older cat pounce lays next to my mouse hand where he can reach me to make sure I'm still there and always have one paw maintaining contact.
---
Last and important: 
---
Trim claws. My cats tell me when their claws are too long by getting my attention and poking me meaningfully.  No.  Really.  Get them used to trimmed claws and they will stop fighting when you trim.  
---
Get a brush they like.  Keeps shedding down and can be a cuddle experience.
---
Remember a few months from now to deny wanting to pay money for it because you don't like it's implementation
---
Not true, GW1 accounts that were never linked to Guild Wars 2 are still separate accounts. That means GW1 accounts (especially those made prior to 2010) still need to be restored by their owners, even if they're actively playing GW2.
---
&gt; how is a sequel going to magically fix that?
---
With a new buildcraft and battle system.
---
&gt;combat system is fine. Most encounter/mob design is kinda rubbish though.
---
The battle system creates such a huge discrepancy between good and bad players that half the playerbase would get frustrated and actually *quit the game* if they can't get past a personal story instance.
---
It's because of the battle system and the disparity it creates that the story instances (and open world, to an extent) have to be so mindnumbingly easy that they become boring to anyone who knows what they are doing.
---
The root cause of this is that players in certain gear sets can do literally 10x the damage as others. Meaning there's no middle ground for encounter design. Make it too easy, the vets get bored. Make it too hard, the casuals get frustrated and leave the game. 
---
On that note, there is an issue with range and mobility in GW2 that makes it too easy and preferable to skip trash mobs. Again, it's a hole in GW2's mechanics.
---
None of these were ever issues in GW1. These issues are exclusive to GW2.
---
The skyscale chair looks good but it's a bummer that it's not my mount but a static model. :(
---
I do remember something about that from setting my nephew's account up. I was really confused cause I didn't even remember moving it because I probably did it on launch day.
---
Yea this would be great, and could be done in addition to the actual equipment slots they added now.
---
[removed]
---
You also said you've checked everything, so I repeat the question: what is the point of this thread? You checked it, you didn't like it, go away.
---
They merged the caps, but the value didnt change. My only mistake was saying in 7 years as it made you think I dont know the system was changed in the past.
---
Wasn't Aion originally supposed to be Lineage 3? Something about industrial spies and patents or code stealing?
---
This game is meme
---
Looking thru the way to submit, about the editing do you want us to hide the HUD or not, also would a full body shot be better?
---
Yo thats erwin from attack on titan
---
😮😮😮
---
I hope you take this as a compliment (because it is) but it sorta feels like a very formalized/fancified Disney style. Like the kinda show that'd have absolutely beautiful artwork, but would get cancelled after a single season because they couldn't make bank.
---
That's exactly it. Your build has to have a purpose, even if it's purpose isn't what people are looking for. 
---
I spend a ton of time playing around with gw2skills.net because I like the buildcraft side of this game. 
---
A build like [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmwAw6ZllQKMKyiNRXsKCjFSisBqgn/kdrC-zRZYBh1FdQYwFSEFQ1pQ6RgvzifLbA-e) is a good example. It's clearly a dps/healing hybrid Herald PvE build that I've thought out well. 
---
"Why not go boon duration?"  
---
Herald **pulses** boons on an interval with its Glint facets, meaning I can maintain large durations of 5 boons on 5 (or 10, if traited) people effortlessly.
---
"Why Crusader's gear?"  
---
It's the only gear set in the entire game to have both ferocity and healing power stats. The toughness is kinda forced upon me, but maybe I can tank something in Fractals to help my team out since I'm already so durable. 
---
"Why not go Devastation for Assassin's Presence?"  
---
Assassin's Presence is a great trait, don't get me wrong, but it's overrated by most people. Since I'm focusing on healing AND damage, I used Invocation since Roiling Mists is absolutely absurd and gives me high crit chance (especially combined with Accuracy sigils) on a build focused on healing.
---
"Why not just use this hybrid healing build on a Guardian or something? They heal for even more."  
---
No, they don't. Nothing in this whole game can match the crazy benevolence modifiers of the Salvation line. Ventari's tablet will pulse 7.5k+ healing every 3 seconds, even though I don't have as much healing power as one would expect to get that kind of number.  
---
"Why not go DPS, since you can still give permanent boons anyway?"  
---
I've played a ton of DPS, I'm trying to experiment and have fun. Sue me.
---
See? My build might not be anywhere near meta, but I've thought it out thoroughly and know it's strengths and weaknesses. There's a massive difference between that, and someone who just uses Soldier's trinkets on their PvE DPS build because they couldn't get a hold of something else.
---
edit: I have Zealot's weapons because I have them lying around. Yes, I am crazy for using Zealot's stats, but idc because Zealot's stats ftw.
---
Why has nobody pointed out yet that it wouldn't be ffxiv2.. it'd be ffxv, as in final fantasy part 15.
---
As in there's been 13 sequels already. Then there's Ultima, more than 2 as well. OP's whole supposition is hogwash
---
OR the HoT theme, or cycling through more than just... the PoF theme at minimum
---
Game director didn't leave. Mike Z has been game director since PoF. MO was the president of the company who wants to make new games and it looks like NCSoft have said no.
---
This is one of the lowest quality shit posts I've seen.
---
That name was a joke.
---
And that doesn't apply to gear.
---
I think because it's for mobile.
---
This looks awesome!
---
It wasn't an actual raise though, they just merged the monthly and daily caps into one when they changed system. So it was always 15k just split before that merge.
---
+1 for NCsoft but why so late? They should react few years ago. What's wrong with this MO guy? He thinks Arena Net is his personal folwark or what? He almost led gw2 to the ruin. His new gaming studio should be blacklisted. They will probably try to scam more unaware people by doing some semi-finished products.
---
I knew about FFXI but I didn't know it was a sequel per se. As in, I thought it was just another Final Fantasy Online, in a completely different world.
---
I see someone cant get enough of the end of bfa cutscene.

Dude, he is one of the original founder and was the last one left...

Spam air overload.
---
Lots of nice promotion of the event from Arenanet too over on Twitter. It's good that they are picking up a community initiative and I wish all the best to the racers!
---
Icebrood and Sons of Svanir can travel via portals even into the Mist already so Kralk's power may strengthen that ability.
---
Those portals were caused by the Wolf Havroun (see norn PS), so it was a temporary thing. But depending on how much of Balthazar's magic Jormag would get (shouldn't be much tbh), that power could return.
---
But it's my own build that I made myself and I play it perfectly ! It has perma stab and might  so I don't even need support. I don't need to be a sheep following snocro to play ffs
---
Also you say its impossible but if everyone had used a tanky class and kited instead of going for their sheep "seen on youtube" strategy we would've succeeded, so clearly the problem isn't scrapper like you suggest
---
200 💎
---
@Anet new Launcher/Char screen or riot!
---
I’ll take it
---
I think this is exactly the way these priorities should work, and it sometimes scares me when I care more about my character's inventory than about college stuff, even if it's situational.
---
***SASAGEYOOOOOOOOOOO***
---
Aw wow your style is gorgeous! He looks so good, and handsome \^\^ Can't wait to see more! His right(our left) leg looks twisted and broken though, maybe needs to be facing forward more?
---
You can run hybrid DPS and get [some decent DPS](https://youtu.be/mThyB_5Xjgo) or run it as a healer. Both can provide permanent 10 man alacrity and the rotations are pretty smooth, mainly revolving around energy management. You could also play the condi DPS revenant version and provide 5 man alacrity but that's only good in raids with another condi Ren.
---
What are you going for? WvW, PvP or Raid armor?
---
It's not "certain gear choices," it's unintelligent gameplay, shitty traits and intentionally defensive choices that stem from a poor understanding of the game's boon and condition system.  Past a certain point it doesn't matter whether someone is in Berserker's, Vipers, Trailblazer's, Marauder's or even Soldiers so long as they understand how their traits and gameplay synergize and what weapons, utilities and elite skills play into their build.  I've seen all sorts of weird shit and it isn't gear that's the problem; it's a game where players can get away with the bare minimum.
---
Raid armor, edited my text, thx
---
Once again your utter lack of self-awareness is blowing my mind.
---
A long time ago, Quaggans were apex predators.
---
This. Also people who pm you angrily when you ask for a specific class eg Druid and they bring their shitty minstrels scourge instead
---
Can vouch for the desk space. I keep an old shirt of mine that my cat loves to lay on, she'll be there all day. The younger one likes to be on the back of my chair.
---
Cats love to be near their humans. My oldest will follow me room to like my dog does, she's my baby :')
---
As for the claws, I just have a cat tower they are free to tear up. The younger still needs to learn a bit of restraint while playing, but the old one won't even knead me while we're in bed unless I have a blanket on me, that's something you can easily train them for.
---
&gt; At the moment I only have 1-2 hours per day, few days per week. In the near future I will have more time.
---
If you're in NA it takes that much time to assemble a raid team currently. I really hope you succeed, but honestly, I feel sorry for you.
---
With a decent group, you can do any of the first four wings in less than an hour. It’s going to take a while to get into it, however, especially considering how hard it is to get started when every pug demands 100+ Legendary insights and varying amounts of kill proofs.
---
You had to ask? You know the answer. Yet you did. Also, i'm really sorry for your old man, hope there will be someone better around to care for him.
---
Careful there. You know what Anet does to its fans that come up with better ideas than them.
---
I still say the best way for them to do this would be to charge for armoury storage slots.  They showed in the livestream that anything you slot into a template basically is removed from inventory and put in a special inventory called the armoury.  That's why something you put in your first template slot can also be put in your second template slot, it's still able to pull from the armoury.  So instead, they could let players add stuff to the armoury directly, equip the templates from there, and sell the template slots for a small amount, something like 100 gems per slot.  And then they can sell more armoury slots for a sizable amount.  If you want to have two fully different gear sets, you'll need enough armoury slots to handle that many different items.  But if you only need to make slight tweaks, like changing a couple of gear pieces to Assassin instead of Berserker, you won't need as many armoury slots.
---
~~https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/ all there~~ oh wait, it's not
---
If you know you didn't check everything then why write you checked everything?  
---
&gt;auto attacks [...] kills my brain 
---
Ah, ok.
---
Nobody is here to "change your mind about the game", if you don't enjoy it then go away, nobody cares. :)
---
&gt;So you're all in favor of minmaxing, as long as it's not branded as such, right ?
---
 
---
Well no, because my perception of minmaxing is apparently different from what other people think.
---
Copypasted SC gear + infusions = minmaxing. Copypasted SC gear - infusions = optimized.
---
I prefer without infusions so I'm in favor of being optimized, not minmaxed.
---
Wrong. People were even complaining about the caps [in 2014](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/gw2/10k-5k-daily-monthly-cap). And the cap was 15k total, just like it is today.
---
From a "making money" perspective, NCsoft/ArenaNet would be stupid to not make a Guild Wars 3 with the success of Guild Wars 2. It's only if Gw3 does badly that they shouldn't bother with more.
---
Right now, it would be a good idea for ArenaNet to start making Guild Wars 3, but they might not have enough people. Luckily, Guild Wars 2 is still making *enough* money, but obviously, launching a new game would be much much better for revenue long-term.
---
True!
---
DPS can be much lower what can be achieved with current meta builds to complete encounters within enrage timer.
---
Actually DPS can be really low to complete encounters within enrage timer.
---
Need little bit CC too.
---
Mmmm yes pls
---
Well, something you definetly should get on with as soon as possible are those cancerous provisioner tokens. it takes forever and it's by far the most boring part, but doesn't require much time, so you can do it.
---
It wouldn't be that unrealistic. There's a direct sequel to FFX called FFX-2 and a direct sequel to FFXIII called FFXIII-2. The current FFXIV could have been something else as well.
---
But FFXV already came out three years ago, so it would be FFXVI or FFXVII, depending on the other single-player games they plan to release first.
---
Honestly, I wish that the theme changed depending on the area your last character played logged off in: 
---
The Original theme for the original game, LWS2 and competitive zones.
---
The HoT theme for HoT, LWS3 and for Mistlock since it was created during that time) as well as if it's your next login after purchasing HoT (but not PoF).
---
The PoF theme for PoF, LWS4 and (hopefully temporarily until they make a new theme) The Icebrood Saga, as well as if it's your next login after purchasing PoF (Priority over HoT).
---
Legendary Insights will take a bunch of weeks. You should just do your best with the collections, and you’ll get LI along the way. You can start with provisioner tokens now, though. They can take a long time if you don’t want to spend a lot of money. If you only buy the rare gear that costs around 50-60s, you’ll have to do it every day for a while, so that’s something you can start doing right away.
---
Revenants and to a slightly lesser degree, Warriors too.
---
That's just counting PvE. 5/9 classes with a wide variety of builds in PvE alone, not including minor variations.
---
My open-world gameplay is 90% pressing 1111111111. Normal open-world, world bosses, meta events, bounties, everything.
---
But in raids and fractals I try to follow some kind of rotation, though my DPS choices DD and DE rotations are mostly pressing 1111111111.
---
Dawg this game came out in 2012. There used to be no cap. I've been playing since beta and have over 40k. The cap came before HoT iirc.
---
edit: Furthermore, the cap used to be split between dailies and monthlies but those were eventually merged when they did away with monthlies.
---
Well they've gotten even crazier with the names lol. Point was, successful mmoRPGs getting a sequel is NOT uncommon.
---
that's about the only time i get bothered by players doing realllly poor damage is on the boss train post dragonfall meta. but i've never called anyone out for "not being minmaxed" lol . i just make it a point to get to the boss before the zerg comes and scales it up and i can get 15-25% of the health down by myself before they get there.
---
i really just need to turn off arc in open world lol
---
Before you start make sure your Raid masteries are maxed. You'll get it unlocked after your first Raid. Find a training raid join in LFG or from the Discord server Raid Academy. Other than that start getting your provisioner tokens done, which are time gated. Once you get a hang of raids you can pug in LFG every Monday. Any other day of the week you're unlikely to get a clear or a group at all.
---
Poor monitor choice if it is not shielded
---
Correct
---
The whole idea that they're stopping at 14 is a joke. It should be called perpetual fantasy
---
I would go for Provisioner Tokens, and Legendary insights!
---
Reduces cost of the next one...
---
It's possible that we get a spiritual successor to gw2, but not actually gw. Especially with Mana works, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
---
A placebo is a hell of a thing.
---
Mapped to my mouse buttons
---
Personally I really liked the potion of pvp/wvw reward
---
Power button is on top of the system... I had to tape a plastic piece over the button.
---
Nice keyboard
---
in case you are wondering, whose [throwaway account](https://imgur.com/a/rYs0xBC) was posting it
---
Do druids have any place in pvp? I'm interested in doing wvw on druid but I'm having trouble finding any builds that are community supported. I'm a noob, halp.
---
Let me get back in town, I just upgraded my system. Upgraded the GPU to a 2080 Duke from MSI and will post the full specs later.
---
heh, I wish this was reality
---
in another universe anet is thriving and we're getting icebrood saga as an expansion 😭
---
I'm just trying to sjdufifwkdnfkkdkfkmsns (shoves cat) warn you
---
To be fair, legendary equipment will be better than before (unless you were using arcdps templates) because chainging stats was a nightmare, but the fact that you can't easily share the equipment between toons is still a problem that will most likely make people to keep using ascended sets for the most part. Only the character holding the legendary will be able to avoid using extra ascended sets.
---
so what?
---
And good job on delivering it. I don't mind being proven wrong as long as actual proof is presented. And you delivered. No hard feelings.
---
Anet here i just want to say thank you for your suggestion.
---
From now on you can buy a new launcher and player screen for only 2000 gems.
---
but wait there is more,only today we will give you a 50% discount,
---
When I first saw this (on mobile) I though “Awesome! Anet finally updated something”, then I read the title and remembered why I quit the game. #dyinggame
---
No thank you. 2g for dailies is enough of an incentive after reaching AP cap. I’m at 34k AP currently, and I like reaching various caps and slowing down my progression rate.
---
True, but the point is that they can change size.
---
no, not yours, it was u/gituve
---
so basically, what you are proposing is just give legendary sn special treatment. It could be a thing but it's not gonna happen because it would it would be too unfair for those without legendaries.
---
The way equipment builds should have been done woudl require to rebuild the current development almost from zero so its not gonna happen.
---
In any case saying that the new templates are a downgrade from arcdps, while it might be true objectively, you have to consider that if you take the whole playerbase as reference those with arcdps are a minority, so anything they get will be an improve. A different matter is that many people will quickly realize that things could have been done better.
---
Just try and get as much of the HoT raid wings done each week for LI . Do daily provisioner tokens (time gated part). You should get the first collection part by playing, just remember to do some of the chests etc.  and the other small things (see wiki). Save gold for the armor once you are ready.
---
Came here expecting it to be shipped in a box, and for the Charr to instead crawl into the box and nest with the chair sitting next to it, but this is still true to the point of things
---
Did you play TR? Garriot got the sweet end of that deal..
---
Both power and condi Quickbrand are a lot of fun in fractals.  The on-demand AoE quickness and Aegis really let you feel instantly how much you’re contributing to the group’s effectiveness and survival.  The old support Scourge may still be more powerful in terms its ability to make any content faceroll for a group, but Quickbrand is pretty satisfying alternative.
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about, you'll still be able to swap them from inventory, which is my point. Also sure, it might be slightly lacking here or there, but I don't see how it's "overdesigned".
---
1) you have 2 points #4
---
2)
---
&gt; It'd be difficult to come up with a compelling story for GW3
---
Making video games is difficult
---
Capitalization matters. I noticed you said you renamed Hook to "reshade64" but it has to be "ReShade64". I run Hook, Arc, and Mount Raidal Menu all just fine. Same setup but my radial menu is renamed to the d3d9_chainload.
---
Oh wow, that's actually really cool. I may look into it.
---
Between Warrior, Guardian, and Revenant which is the best for aoe?
---
I tried all possible capitals.
---
Relog fixed it x3
---
But quaggas are coooOOOoool
---
I get the compressed cardboard panels and those are so satisfying to tear up they don't mess with furniture.  Mess of shredded cardboard is easily cleaned up.
---
Yes, you don't need max dps. No, dps isn't unimportant.
---
Bad dps on gorse means doing updrafts, potentially slow CC. On Adina it means more pillars, on VG it means more blues/greens. On Sabetha it means more cannons. On Sloth it means more shrooms, more cc's on Matthias. You can keep going for the other bosses.
---
The point is, you can have a subpar dps and think you're allright because you get every mechanic right. Problem is someone, at some point, is going to wipe the group over a mechanic. Less mechanics makes the group more likely to survive. Therefore by lowering the amount of mechanics you have to deal with, dps is super important to your group's survival.
---
Nobody kicks a FT engi because they don't think he's a good player, they kick him because by dealing shit damage he actually lowers the chances the party has to survive. 
---
inb4 having lower dps on samarog allows your CC to recharge between breakbars
---
Edit: Still too scared to answer my question! If you don't have anything to say then shut up :)
---
Just saying, you can make a MainMenu playlist. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Customized_soundtrack
---
So, speaking as someone who did every achieve for every event as they came out since head start (save a couple here and there amounting to maybe 50ap total) and the fact that he amassed a good 5000 more AP than me and is number 2 in the leaderboards of AP for NA and top 5 for the game total, kind of says that there must have been some advantage that he had over every other player in the game.  He's telling us that advantage was no cap on daily achievements when it first came out.  So that's worthy of being called proof, IMO.
---
My kitty does this too, she tends to be a little more on the mousepad though making it hard to move the mouse. Also she likes bumping her head against the screen, sometimes turning it off hehe. The other place she'll lie is on top of the actual pc (which for me is on top of the desk) to soak up the warmth while in arms reach!
---
It needs to be ..... at least twice this size!
---
Yeah, and again, I still think that it's unnecessary, but that is unnecessary for me.
---
For others, I truly think that 600 or 800 gems is *way* too much. I actually think that 400 is also too much, but more acceptable since it's 150~180g.
---
In sPvP if you wanna be competitive I don't think there is any viable Druid build (it was hit pretty hard by several PvP exclusive nerfs) and as far as I could see the current meta seemed to have shifted toward like 5 roaming/duelists/+1s so supports are not really part of the equation and you can't really be a duelist or abunker or whatev currently with Druid.
---
For WvW roaming/small scale fighting (1-5) you have roughly the same issues as with sPvP and even if fights setups are a bti different the support you can provide will not shine much and your damage risks being very poor compared to what a Soulbeast could dish out. Maybe [Stealth Trapper](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Druid_-_Stealth_Trapper) can kinda still work as a 1-trick-pony kind of deal but not in the long run or against more skilled oponents imo.
---
For WvW zerg (15-20+) unfortunately a lot of classes can do support/heal better than Druid because they will provide more interesting utility on top of the heal (as I hope I made clear that being a Druid DPS is not an option, even less here):
---
* Firebrand gives you 10-target stab, good heal and condi cleanse, nice defensive boons too (has bascially been a pillar of WvW zerk since it arrived in game as was Core Guard before it)
---
* Scrapper povide very strong sustain heal (when FB is a bit more burst-heal) and tremendous condi conversion, can also bring superspeed and AoE stealth+smoke field
---
* Tempest give very good AoE heal, AoE CC and a ton of combo fields+finishers
---
Druid unfortunately has very little additional utility to provide and its utility skills can have trouble in actually supporting the group.
---
Also the pet can either be uselss, a liability by being a nice condi stacking target or give away your position if it did not get stealthed when your zerk did (which is very likely).
---
For general build recommendations in WvW zergs [Vabbi](http://builds.vabbi.org/) is usually a good pick and to quote them on Ranger in zergs (to summarize my point):
---
&gt;In all seriousness, think about it. You can give some boons and heals as druid but firebrands and revenants do it way better than you, can do some range damage on enemy casters... but you can do it off squad while roaming alone.
---
Its not a proof and Im to lazy to do calculations of APs since 2012 and possible permutations. However, that's irrelevant. we already came to agreement without your interruption.
---
Post a screenshot?
---
Could it be your [ranked PvP League Division badge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_League#Divisions)?
---
This is me, just a couple of hours ago. Someone passed by while I was downed, and stopped to rez me. I stood up and hopped a few times as if to say, “hey, thanks a lot for stopping and taking the time to bring me back. I was having a hard time because of the condition damage that plant there kept applying to me. I really appreciate it.”
---
And then he hopped back, as if to say “no problem, no problem. I completely understand, my good fellow. I have a deep rooted belief that what makes this game superior to others in the genre is that the game mechanics actively support altruistic behavior.”
---
Condi herald was always annoying to fight against in small scale, but it's beyond useless in large scale. It has too short range to be good there. It hasn't been viable since late HoT and nothing changed marginally to make it any better.
---
Precious pic, ugly char :(
---
Difference between the two boon chronos he listed is one entire traitline + changes to the chronomancer traitline. In terms of gear it's an entire stat swap.
---
The difference in traits between the two condi chronos is minimal, but the gearswap is complete
---
The mirage build has one line in common with condi chrono but uses 2 other, different traitlines, including the elite one. It uses viper's gear too but with different runes and weapons
---
The power chrono dps build uses completely different gear and runes compared to all of these (zerk+scholar, assassin pants and accessories) , and only has duelling and chronomancer (changing middle trait) in common with support chrono
---
I've included other changes in my previous response
---
So yeah, a bit more than a one trait change, sort of. Hope it helps you see how that works !
---
Damn, this is so true
---
Why not just keep using arcdps?
---
If u wanna get your LIs fast you should just gear a druid (or other healer) or chronotank. They usually have to pull most of the weight and the average pug stays away from them and just wants to play "dps". Then they all get shafted cause dps spots get filled in seconds. I literally started raiding on an alt account with no LI, no KP and i just breezed my way through fullclears from lfg even without meeting the kp requirements just because most groups are stuck for 30min looking for someone to tank.
---
Learning curve is much harder than playing dps or warrior but you will learn mechanics much faster and you will be way more independent as you will inevitably have way more access to lfg groups.
---
This is what i say to people that wanna progress through raids but dont have the time for training discords, training guilds, full organized runs. Gear yourself a druid or chronotank, dont be a pussy and just have at it, you will be able to join way more training groups and as soon as you learn your stuff you might even be asked to join guilds and statics.
---
This is basically how i started and i pugged from simple boss kills all the way to dhumm cm.
---
It kind of achieves the same thing until a certain number of characters, which probably was the point of making "shared slots" at all instead of adding more "per character". So it's a "needless bullshit" only if you don't think about it from the company perspective, otherwise it actually makes sense.
---
Actually, you can.  This requires everyone else to be on point though.
---
EDIT:  With the exception of WvW.
---
Please post a vid of your mash 1 zerker dhuum CM senpai, teach me how to be that good

Hey. I'm playing reaper for PvE specifically HoT maps and found it super easy compared to other classes. I use my minions to up my dps. For GS focus using 3 to build up lifeforce. A reapers dps comes from hitting that F1 and using your #4 skill to completion. Literally spin baddies to death, then spam 1 until your lifeforce is out.
---
Use your golem skill, your GS 5, reaper 3's fear, and 5 to cc bars for extra damage. 
---
Also make sure your outfitted with exotic gear, try for bezerkers. With appropriate trait lines and minions your toughness should be okay, and you'll out dps before dropping low.
---
Also I think mainhand dagger has lifesteal skill on 2. Pop that mid fight to get extra health.
---
Most importantly if you're an Asuran please disregard advice and go delete your character tyvm
---
I think you are right, maybe sometimes I overthink too much the 'meta' stuff and forget about fun. That's why I wanted to try this, since I got a bit bored of the classic hammer backline and trying out some changes out of the meta I didn't see too much difference at all... And it was way more fun for me.  Ty for your reply.
---
Ok, what if they put out a new feature called "push to play" which allows you to press your buttons to cast skills ? 1,2 and 3 are bound by default, and every key beyond that is 400 gems. I mean, you wouldn't whine yeah ? You had that functionality before but you aren't losing much since you can just click your skill icons to cast. Btw you can't buy more than 9, so you'll have to forego your action skill, f skills and/or elite, but come on, you don't need a hotkey for ALL of these skills !
---
I know people who get around clicking all their skills, why should we be concerned with people who like to think they are 1337 because they push buttons instead ? It's a free to play game and it took them time to add that feature, so it's normal to pay for it !
---
I'd do that, but I'm worried my dog would eat the cardboard lol
---
Never is a long time.  After 10 years they will start on new game if GW2 still exists, IMHO.  That game might take 5 years to release.. You can't wait too long - because the 'name' of the old game will lose value from marketing perspective. But you need to wait long enough such that you can make a splash. 
---
Technology does advance in the game industry - hardware gets better and importantly its different (multi-core is a thing now). And software libraries that they use to often write the games get better.  Engines get better if you use a 3rd party one..  AI software and approaches improve.
---
It's slow - but sooner or later it becomes worth it to update.  MMO's are not doomed.  I'd argue the opposite once the technology improves they will be the dominant game type of the future.  Smarter NPCs,  generated levels, generated dungeons that don't such, a better engine, and better development tools and such make sequels guaranteed in the long run..
---
That's already the case. Chrono already HAS TO do that. And still provides the avantages I listed.
---
You mean "rez plz". Ain't no one got time for shift and !.
