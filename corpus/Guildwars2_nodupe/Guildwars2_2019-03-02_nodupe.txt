It is not about fun; it is gimmicky rather than intuitive challenging content.
---
---
---
I really hope that question isn't serious.
---
More money for Anet, more content, everyone wins
---
It is mainly support chrono's damage being nerfed due to signet of ether. Any other Nerf is OK and well balanced such that it requires some skillful play and most of all flawless rotation
---
No they can. They're sort of like an "extra health shield" on top of your existing health. Barriers can be crit just like normal health, and any extra damage that surpasses the barrier is done directly to the health underneath.
---
If only we could wipe the sweat off of our metal helmet in 60 fps.
---
Did you even watch the stream? Speed is slowest of the mounts, and seems to get slower in enemy territory. And you cannot mount up while in combat, so there's no "ball up and murder the rest".
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Besides, the mounting goes both ways.
---
Will money always be hard to come by?
---
 One thing I've noticed about GW2 compared to, say, ESO, is that so far (level 13), money is scarce. I mean, in ESO, as a new player, if you just more or less vendor most of the stuff you find on your ventures, in no time flat, you've got some cash flow. At level 13 however, I've spent no money besides a few portals here and there. I've got like 35s or something.
---
Am I going to be pleasantly surprised at higher levels?
---
They are using zerg build against your roaming build which gives them disadvantage to begin with. Now zerg players actually have a chance to escape and you get to practice your skills vs other roamers.
---
• Spirit of Nature Active Skill—Nature's Renewal: Reduced the recharge time of this skill from 120 seconds to 40 seconds. Reduced the radius of the revive pulse and condition-cleansing effect from 600 to 240.  
---
That's probably what he meant and 600 range of the *passive* effects is what it'll be, down from 1000
---
Okay let me make it even more simple.
---
I had more fun with the way it was before.
---
I can't believe it's so hard to understand?
---
In terms of body type definitely. Some of their faces look pretty child-like too.
---
We have solutions. People just don't like them because they are afraid of the word.
---
-If you really want to know, your first post had inaccuracies about the Republican plans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.
---
Here's what I said:
---
&gt; "The Republicans tried to overhaul it to allow competition over state lines"
---
https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/322669-trump-obamacare-replacement-will-get-rid-of-state-lines-for-insurance
---
Which part of that is incorrect or a lie?
---
-Your second post had flat out lies about the Green New Deal's cost and plans.
---
&gt; The Green New Deal involves Universal Health Care and had an estimated cost of 92 Trillion dollars. To pay for that everyone in the US would have to be taxed at 100% for anything they made over 30k. That means if you make 70k a year you're giving the government 40k to pay for things like not being able to eat hamburgers and fly in airplanes.
---
The only estimate i've found for the Green New Deal is from https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-new-deal-would-cost-93-trillion-or-600g-per-household-study-says
---
https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2019/02/09/green-new-deals-plan-for-planes-trains-and-automobiles-wont-work/
---
 &gt;Totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle
---
 
---
 https://www.beefmagazine.com/management/green-new-deal-proposes-eliminating-farting-cows
---
 &gt;The freshman senator says, “We set a goal to get to net zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.”
---
So I'll ask again which of my statements are inaccurate or lies? Did you have other sources that counter any of these points?
---
&gt;Normally I would not have removed the post and just said to end the discussion but the inaccuracies and lies made them worth removing overall.
---
Yet I still haven't seen you telling the multiple other posters in this topic to end their political discussion which seems suspect. My hypothesis is that you're using your privilege, as a moderator, to suppress minorities, those who don't want socialism, in this sub.
---
Expect that with that mount, even roamers can run out of situations they don't like if they want to, not just zergers. 
---
Also, roaming has nothing to do with not being able to win in equal conditions, they'd just play necro, warrior or thief for that.
---
They get super fucked because they have no way of forcing you to pay
---
Makes me happy to be a chrono main. I can just trait an answer to everything xD
---
How about no? How about first seeing how its gonna be for real and not just in your imagination? How about not panicking BEFORE the fact?
---
While I have no love for mobile 'pay to have fun' games, I am somewhat relieved that a game does not need a Hollywood blockbuster budget just to try at being successful.
---
But really, mobile games are just the offsprings of a long tradition of game making, and their parents were the php and flash games everyone was playing in 2010. Someday mobile games will die too and a new generation of froggers and tetris will emerge on a new support.
---
Human greed on the other hand is probably there for the long run. 'If you will buy it, someone will sell it', as they say.
---
Mounts have very little HP. The warclaw has considerably more health than all other mounts,  12K over the ~10k of the springer, but it's still very little health. 
---
Roaming builds can often kill players in very little time. I've seen people single-handledly taking down a warrior in full nomad gear in less than 3 seconds from engage. No buildup of skills, no outnumbering, Just a single quick burst. 
---
A mount will have no chance. 
---
In his defense it doesn't actually explain it clearly in the tooltip
---
I thought Cutsy was the Asura tagging all the big city with cut-out cardboard...
---
Also know that a lot of potential gold making is from salvaging equipment and selling the mats to players. I know I edited this into my original comment but I think you responded before the edit. You mentioned vendoring stuff so I just want to meme sure to say that you should not vendor equipment you find that you can't or don't want to use. 
---
Excited. Druid for the longest time was a very boring to play class because of its long cooldowns and stationary skills. Im hyped, definitely.
---
It is.  We simply don't have the money to pay for everyones healthcare and if we did,  hundreds of thousands of people in the insurance industry would lose their jobs
---
It is.
---
It works in Canada because they have a population less than California.
---
We have 49 states in addition to that.
---
Do you know to see a comet crash to be able to tell it's gonna be a disaster? They've shown us the mount and it's pretty easy to tell the effects, where's the need to see it in game before asking for tweaking?
---
Or is an extra super mobile, 12k hp, 3 dodges, 2k damage finisher mount not enough to make you realise what it's gonna break?
---
Plot twist: roamers already have shit tons of mobility/stealth and can choose fights however they want to.
---
Not really, he has some good points, what he says about players running back to zerg is a good point, it's gonna be hard to stop the flow of player support. Meaning some classes lose the ability to quickly thin out the flow of players. Anyways, well see.. 
---
I'm only here to point out one thing that's really bugging me. The numbers shown kind of skews the perspective into something much more drastic than it should. The graphic from which you pulled these numbers is partly to blame, but the fact that you highlighted this without really addressing any discrepancy in statistics is something that should be pointed out:
---
**&gt;Mobile games = 551 billion Won**
---
**&gt;GW2 = 20.1 billion Won**
---
Right, so without really much else to add, what you excluded:
---
"Mobile games" holds its own category without posting *how many* actual mobile IPs from NCSoft are in contributing to this statistic. Glancing over at NCSoft's wikipedia page, I see there are 5 active mobile games. So this 551 billion Won could be divided any which way. Why this article is choosing to focus on an old graphic when more current graphs have been available speaks to authors and their ability to cherry-pick statistics to paint a picture. The same "Mobile games" category doesn't see this big a number in Q4 \[seen here in this article\]([https://massivelyop.com/2018/02/07/ncsoft-q4-2017-guild-wars-resurges-as-blade-soul-and-lineage-m-drive-profits/](https://massivelyop.com/2018/02/07/ncsoft-q4-2017-guild-wars-resurges-as-blade-soul-and-lineage-m-drive-profits/)).
---
Now, I'm not calling shenanigans as much as I am saying that incomplete or bad statistics are just unhelpful. We could just as easily lump in GW2 with other PC titles and tally it up to being just under 120 billion Won, or just under 20% of what the entire Mobile category made in Q3 -- this is not as dire a picture as we were initially given. With a more complete picture, maybe we can worry a little less about the health of the PC gaming industry. 
---
Instead, we can focus on the volatility of the mobile gaming industry and be thankful that well-produced games can stand the test of time over how quickly mobile games can be produced and die out. This could help us understand other trends, and maybe realize that mobile gaming studios could be subject to a much higher turnover rate than their PC gaming counterparts.
---
That's a subset of builds that are build around heavy burst. 
---
Not only do these builds have a ceiling, and bursting 15k hp does not mean you can burst 27k hp with just a few more seconds, since they'll often be on CD, but you also have to consider the builds with no burst or that seriously lack damage (hello SD weavers).
---
To encourage people to play wvw, something the game mode desperately needs. 
---
It's supposed to be useless in pve so pve exclusive players don't feel forced to get it
---
Well they got nerfed in sPVP so tuesday we will know if it was enough. . . Spirit change looks good on paper. 
---
That's WvW since the start, deal with it m8
---
Balance team isnt the wvw team. And the balance team isnt going to look after the mount, the wvw team is. Thats the difference between weaver and warclaw.
---
I think proccing boons are now fully tied to active ability, instead of active. Won't be surprised if they also only proc for 5 targets. 
---
Passive bonuses are supposed to stay as they are, become even better even, since you cna now upkeep all spirits (including elite) at all times. 
---
Bear in mind that $30 only gives you main xpac story, you'll have to pay extra for every single missed LS episode - that's around 3k gems, so $35-40 give or take.
---
For a game that tried to sell itself with story, it's not worth it, especially how a massive chunk of it is lost forever.
---
Could you dig any deeper? You are already past midway.
---
How often will we need to intentionally kill them, now that they can be easily moved?
---
How are you gonna catch up exactly? Mounts have the same speed. 
---
Also, you're saying that the pounce will do 75% of 12k hp? Based on what? That would be a disaster too by the way. 
---
And very little builds take away 25% of 12k hp in a single AA.
---
Adapt? I know the other playstyles, I enjoy playing some of them. I don't solely play roaming builds. My point is that this addition kills a playstyle, for no added value expect some swag skins.
---
Roaming is gonna be hella diminished, and please try to make sense of the numbers you're throwing out too. 
---
All the male cats I've known have been huge assholes, but in theory you are correct. 
---
Everyone needs new faces and hair.
---
You gave generic answers but I refuted all your points with sources which apparently you don't have counter points or sources to refute so I still disagree anything I've said is inaccurate or a lie.
---
I don't feel the need to suppress views as I'm able to articulate ideas intelligently so I won't bother reporting posts. 
---
I believe you're abusing your power to push an agenda you agree with, you've already admitted to it on the other post you removed that I quoted. If you think your actions are protecting the community I invite you to see how well heavy handed censorship worked out for the forums. The power crazed mods are the reason no one posts there and you seem to be pushing this sub down the same path.
---
I think it would be in your best interest to just update the sidebar to include "Please do not discus things neok182 doesn't personally agree with", it would save a lot of time for reports. 
---
Exactly this
---
Imagine the additional lag!
---
Brave of you to think you'll be killing "zergs" with this and not just 10 dudes trying to start a squad going getting instant killed by 2000 range evading mounts.
---
Maybe they should work together because the wvw is doing some pretty heavy unbalanced work it seems.
---
I didnt say I have problem with it, but I wouldnt brag about that either.
---
Ok that's a great point.  I totally vendor equipment .  I'll grab some salvage kits.
---
Thanks for that! Sad I'll never experience the game at the start while everything was new and maps were full everywhere. Good to hear this!
---
The mount runs on a lower speed outside of friendly territory...and if you can use the triple dash, so can your target...
---
This is wishful thinking, but it's entirely possible that there's integration for this mount in LSS5. Wouldn't be too hard for ANET to add siege mechanics to a new map, sort of like the flip side of Silverwastes.
---
Cook's outfit is kinda close
---
Get basic kits when you can and use them on everything you don't need till you start getting gear level 68+ then use a [mystic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Salvage_Kit)/[master](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Master%27s_Salvage_Kit) kit on the rare items.
---
&gt; How are you gonna catch up exactly? Mounts have the same speed.
---
are you suggesting you only ever attack from behind? unless your enemy is literally running away in a straight line, you will eventually catch up.
---
&gt; Also, you're saying that the pounce will do 75% of 12k hp? Based on what? That would be a disaster too by the way.
---
that was just a guess. unlike you i am aware of the fact that the mount will only have base toughness, and as such will eat quite a lot more damage than a player with a zerg build. and you do not have to take out the last bit of health - even when it's (careful, random number) 75% - with a single autohit. also i like how you conveniently ignore the vulnerability window you as a roamer could heavily abuse if you even considered getting to the part where you dismount a player.
---
&gt; Adapt? I know the other playstyles, I enjoy playing some of them. I don't solely play roaming builds. My point is that this addition kills a playstyle, for no added value expect some swag skins.
---
it's effectively a balance change. some build might die, others might be born, and yet others might simply adjust 🤷‍♀️
---
&gt; Roaming is gonna be hella diminished, and please try to make sense of the numbers you're throwing out too.
---
there is gonna be a transitional phase, sure, but people will adjust. gliding didn't make roaming close to enemy-owned ledges any rarer either 🤷‍♀️ and before you point fingers, you should maybe consider making an actual reasonable request. if you can argue based on assumptions, so can others. while my numbers might be off, it doesn't change a thing. you either have only thought about this on a very shallow level, or you purely considered own playstyle(s)... 🤷‍♀️
---
Because there's a big difference between "this sounds really cool" and "this is actually an option gameplay and balance wise". 
---
For gliding, you can't glide in stealth and dropping down is essentially being CC'd and hard to coordinate for the aerial squad. In practise being on the ground, stacked, buffed and ready is almost always better than dropping on players.
---
So it's something that's only done as BM when the ground squad is chanceless. 
---
You mean collecting downstates to freely bomb / banner / pounce on? 
---
Why would they bomb their own downstates? They might MI / illusion / try to res them but I don't see why they'd bomb them. 
---
Cleansing your condies and resetting OOC isn't exactly difficult in most situations. "You need to not be in combat with phantasms and minions". Because those are SO relevant in group PvP. 
---
I'm not saying this is OP. I'm just saying everything you wrote is a nonfactor and makes me wonder if you actually play WvW. 
---
Sorry but with the amount of money the US put into their military it just sounds ridiculous to say there isn‘t enough money. (Also there could be more money if the US would adjust how much some people have to pay in taxes).
---
I highly doubt it. It takes seconds to craft new legendaries, you can just stock parts and exchange them when patch drops. No collections needed.
---
I am going to have to disagree. One thing that you are not considering is that mounts have their own stats. In fact, their toughness is base toughness so they are paper.
---
Also your mobility is by no means useless. It's still good for kiting or running away from an engagement. In addition, you will still have fights over objectives. The only thing that will change is that you will not automatically be able to reliably catch up with zerglings or roaming builds of the "inferior" classes. Gimmicky 1-shots from stealth will also no longer be possible as openers. Forgive me for not worrying about cancerous game play going away.
---
On the bright side for roamers though, that siege skill might be a bit useful.
---
I’d assume the ring will require season 4 map participation. 
---
Balthazar's Sword sounds like a good choice if they did that.
---
Honestly I didn't know his background, but it makes even more sense. He truly is a legend and I really respect the man. His job must've been tough through the years, but the fact he is respected by his employees even in this dire time it's outstanding.
---
WoD might actually not be much of a buff, at least with the good guilds that have boonflip scepter/focus + axe/dagger scourges or some variant of that. Pop WoD, immediately attract all the devouring darknesses and have your stab flipped to fear, gg. Hell if your squad isn't big the SB might get singled out preemptively. We'll have to see, I hope it works and melee trains come back. 
---
they mean the ring for which the first step has been in the game for almost 1.5 years. season 4 might get its own trinket though.
---
I'm on NA and this hurts so much to read because of how accurate it is.
---
He's saying currently gankers have the ability to nope out of any bad fights and engage as they please; but many other specs do not. The idea that necro is a good roamer is absurd. 
---
I guess WSR and RoS , whos the third server tho ?
---
It's still fun if you have a guild.
---
Reward tracks are a joke with potions of wvw rewards from dailies. 
---
Most players will be in the bottom tier for pips and there isn't a skip ahead mechanism for them to collect the skirmish tickets.
---
If Im not mistaken, in one of their concept art books they said they specifically thought of stitch when they were developing the asura.
---
AnetBen did leave... :^)
---
Or, you could play a friend that gives you stab then go in, giving it cc immunity just removes counter play
---
I would add a map overview of the chest train route and add a note (maybe I missed it) explaining that RIBA is more lucrative than chest train. I command the SW following the same route as this powerpoint and I have people hop in and leave because they're trying to find a map with an active bandit chest train. The bags of gear from RIBA give more T2-T3-T4 loot than the bandit chests, it's always better to RIBA over chest trains.
---
Also I would add killing the mordrem champions during the bandit train is good for the seed pouches except the Husk. The husk takes too long to kill and is not worth the effort, better to skip. All other champion mordrems post Vinewrath should be killed.  
---
Overall great write up, ty! :)
---
Bifrost is very versatile,looks nice with armor of all colors. But that wooden dildo won't allways look nice + birds animations are annoying. 
---
TL;DR: personal preference. 
---
The reason I would never add this to any guide is because people already try to stack up on the South boss so they can tag middle/north for extras and it makes the other boss fights take longer as they have fewer people.. More champ bags at the expense of yours and, more importantly, everyone else's time. 
---
Would it be possible for this to just be treated as a petition.
---
Can't tell if people like it because it's funny, because they agree with it or because sex.
---
you probably play on high-slow-time-up groups. There's no way a pchrono could outdps a decent thief on a group without slow on boss
---
Updated, last page with chest farm route and advices, thanks :)
---
I'm maining a weaver a.k.a. the squishiest (one of the?) profession in the game. Never had any issues with birds. 
---
This kind of posts allways makes me smile. Like WTF.
---
Maybe you should stick to Tier 2-3, because obviously YOU are the problem, not the instability. 
---
This is my honest opinion. I'm ready for downvotes. 
---
[removed]
---
This is true, but especially with recent events one wonders if they may look to say about any number of things, "we need to be willing to make some changes."
---
One way of doing this without actually going back on the promise that the Gen 2 legendaries would be obtainable via HoT would be to make them *also* available doing stuff in PoF maps but to make it slightly - not too much, but just enough to make it worth it without taking away from the "premium" on the legendaries - easier.
---
This is so beautiful! &lt;3

It’s better than paying 60% in income tax and things like a head of cauliflower costing $7...I mean you pay for “free” healthcare in other ways. 
---
"Lie" implies an ill intention. Be careful accusing people of that, being a mod and all.
---
Now me, among other's can not make up of what was actually said because you censored it. 
---
Reading the following posts of the affected, I can presume where the person was coming from, but, since no one likes being censored, that amounts to nothing. This whole chain of comments of you replying to deleted comments, is irrelevant to the conversation at hand.
---
Mine has 11k hp. If you follow builds in WvW without understanding them then you should go back to pve. There is no reason why any class on any build can get one shotted. It's just trash design. I'd rather position myself better than add more hp which does absolutely nothing. You can die from retaliation in one meteor shower ffs. 
---
Y'all need some fucking Jesus.
---
Not sure how stopping playing is going to send a message. You'd need a hundred thousand people to stop playing and that's not going to happen. Anything you do in that sort of protest, without a huge outcry is going to just be a wasted gesture. 
---
Layoffs are a part of business as usual for many companies. EA and Blizzard just laid of people while they were extremely profitable. That's very different than what we have here.
---
By protesting layoffs without knowing the inside story about specifically why layoffs happened...we just don't know how good or bad an idea this was from a business perspective. 
---
It's very easy to make emotional reactions to business decisions, but at the end of the day business has to also answer to investors or there are fewer games coming out. it's a shitty situation but that's the situation.
---
Yeah, just make everything purchasable in gem store. You don't even have to play the game, just use your credit card. Easy!
---
I mean, this isn't so much a theory as it is the actual thing that we know happened.
---
Well, maybe replace dimension with world but that's unclear.
---
I moved from the US to Australia 16 years ago and it's a night and day situation with health care. To me, the US is completely backwards and this scaremongering that prevents the US from joining the rest of the civilised world is atrocious. People have a right to an attorney but not a right to get insulin for their diabetes?  Fuck that.
---
although we do have another ring slot ...
---
The only places I've heard of with 60% income tax take care of basically everything for their people.  If you have your health, housing, internet, etc. all taken care of, you don't need nearly as much money as people in the US who have to cover for all that themselves (And build up savings in case they get laid off, which mind you most don't so that's just a quick route to homelessness instead...)
---
almost all money in this game is earned by gathering materials (or salvaging equipment for materials) and then selling the materials. getting actual direct gold rewards is extremely rare.
---
I also think spirit weapons should have been like this 
---
A truly great movie.
---
Since there's a patch on Tuesday, I was wondering how does this usually interact with patches? Is it likely to break and increase chances of crashing or is it generally unaffected by patches?
---
SoI spam solves a lot of problems with otherwise non-functional support builds, and it would likely solve the problems here as well.
---
However, one of the main potential selling points of this build is pairing it with Firebrand/Renegade comps since you can have the Renegade take over as solo healer. This is the main opportunity for some sort of hybrid dps might-share role (Diviner Herald, FfE Deadeye, this Tempest build) since you do need might but don't need a healer. These comps do not benefit from SoI.
---
that's great
---
last time i checked captain america didn't have any mainhand weapon, just the shield
---
this being said just run the meta rifle build but with a shield!
---
oh you want no kits either this is getting interesting
---
just take all the turrets and shield and stare them down while they chip away at stuff with that sweet 500 dps
---
Feminists, where art thou? #sovietflagwaving
---
having a swarm of bees encircling you isn't what i'd call practical either lol
---
Considering dx12 is even more work on the development side of things (for more benefits, mind).... I'd say the answer is a hard no.
---
Maybe (*maaaybe*) they could purchase this lib and extrapolate and integrate from there, thus lessening the required work, but.... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I help a lot of returning players get back into the game. Rather than typing a wall of text, if you're on a US server, you can hit me up in game and I can take you through a bunch of stuff. Hit me up on Vayne.8563 or here.
---
As for starting a new character, it can't hurt, particularly if you have a character slot. I wouldn't delete old characters though because of birthday presents. 
---
&gt; Roaming is a big part of the WvW (since it's the only place where you can actually do it), and a lot of people only play WvW solely for the purpose of roaming and catching small groups of ennemies.
---
Yeah, fuck these people. You'll find they'll have an easier time of it now.
---
That's exactly what my friend did with me first time I got into this game and I fell in love with it!
---
Is this a request for dyeable swimsuits in gw2? xD
---
The funny thing is, that we already *could* see the Mount in action in stream and everything looked very balanced. Absolutely nothing looked overpowered. 
---
And yet the OP started this thread by ignoring absolutely everything (except the 12k hp) from the stream.
---
Well kitten that kitten
---
He meant from a lore angle, i.e. "in-game standpoint".
---
Not having a sub in the first place is what attracted me to the franchise years ago.
---
Adding one would be a letdown.
---
How hard is it to do this? Can I solo it?
---
I don't know about following ESO's model. I tried it out briefly, and even with a sub, I felt there were some QOL things that should have been free.

---
I have been back for about 6 months I wanna say, after a similarly loooong hiatus.  For me I found a few things helped to get me focused and back into my love for the game.  Idk if these will help you but they are doing wonders for me. 
---
1. If you have a true main you like playing start there and focus on one toon at a time.  I have all 11 of my alts set up for daily mat farming so they don't do anything but that at the moment.  It helps bring in some steady gold and I don't feel like they need to be tended to.
---
2. Have a plan, I personally find that the current state of the game is most enjoyable with a plan in place so that I always know that I have a goal, both short and long, to work towards when I start feeling overwhelmed.  
---
3. Don't get in a hurry, GW2 is pretty darn good at rewarding you for long patient routines.  I pick a thing, I keep doing thing, I get things reward, I move to next thing.  While on paper it seems boring, in practice it allows me to focus on getting caught up and reaclimated to the game systems and directly to my characters.  
---
Again this is just what's working for me.  You may not like it and that's cool just thought I would share.  The expansions in my opinion are most definitely worth it.  I liked the story and all the added stuff like the mounts and new maps/activities.  My suggestion go for it if you like GW2 it's a win-win. 
---
Cheers!
---
I regularly make new characters just so I could do all the initial character paths. The paths of the different characters converge near the end of the core game story. Don't worry about starting with a new character, there's no rush to get to the "best parts".

As a side note, I wish they made a journal or atleast an achievement for doing the different paths. This might subconsciously entice players to buy more characters slots, they could just delete the characters I mean, but speaking from experience, some might grow an attachment to their characters. So instead of deleting the characters, they might just keep them and use them from time to time when they are bored. And this might start a character collecting spree, sort of like the feeling of "catchin' all them pokimans".
---
I feel like it will be the opposite and WvW will be swamped with people running aimlessly in circles and people screaming obscenities in map chat (more so than now)
---
I cant imagine that.... the hospital is the largest employer where i live and places are desperate for nurses
---
&gt; have ~~been~~ huge assholes
---
Ftfy
---
That's the question I exactly waited for. Right now, a few, but the aim of this guide is to fix this issue.
---
You would say, how is possible that you doing a few ? How this guide could help you to do more ?
---
The difference between Silverwastes and all other maps and farmings is that to earn more, it requires the people to freely cooperate for the greather good, understanding how and why are they doing what they doing. 
---
It needs everyone in the map to be like a swarm of bees, like ants doing everyone their little thing that makes the "colony" to keep running around the map. In other words, more understanding, more gain with less troubles.  
---
At the current state of Silverwastes, almost no one understand that, everyone keep running around in braindead modality, trying random things or blindly follwing the commander, sometimes is the commander itself that dosn't know what to do.
---
That's the reason of this guide. Silverwastes is alive if the people that plays  it are alive too. Share the knowledge, cause knowledge is power, and with no power ants are easy prey :)
---
If you see someone doing random things, tell them what to do, teach them yourself or let them read this guide, cause if you wanna earn more, everyone needs to know what you know, or even more.
---
&gt; I really look forward to the day when we come up with a solution like my employees who live abroad have. 
---
We already have a solution. Just straight copy whatever they do....One of the problems is that people believe free healthcare ( paid for by taxes. Like a bulk sam's club memebrship ) is communism..
---
So... So more now with mounts and perfect cooperation, or less?
---
I'm sorry I never did silverwastes beyond getting my achievements so I don't know if you're saying we could be doing more now because we have mounts or if you're saying mounts ruined it.
---
I just posted a very long discussion related about what you're talking about, i suggest you to look at it under another comment here before going any further.
---
That's what you must know before anything else, right now its impossible to estimate but i could say some numbers that to me are the starting point to go to from a single full run.
---
100 Bags of Gear  
---
150 Embroidered Coin Purse
---
Plus the Seed Pouches but they're a standard value from any run if you do everything correctly, you can't go more than those.
---
But that's not all you get from the farm itself, you get way a loot more things that are not contained in the bags, that used in the right way makes you to increase the money you get from the farming.  
---
Doing daily ascended crafting materials is an example.
---
I mean, looks like you have the wo, so double click
---
Jokes aside it’s the entrance to verdant brink, the entrance is right next to the fort behind your character 
---
Some lifting was involved indeed....quite a tail indeed.
---
It's more likely that ArenaNet will continue supporting these values, we have no concrete way of knowing if these have changed.  When two large projects are shut down people will lose their jobs, regardless of company values.
---
By quitting you would just as likely send the message that these policies aren't good for business and will not be valued by other companies.
---
 "Charr won't look stupid riding it. "
---
...Man it's a cat riding a cat.
---
It doesn't matter for PvE, only for WvW. If you do buy the expansions at some point, you should get a free server transfer you can use at that time, so I'd say it doesn't matter in your situation.
---
Indeed! we are all exceptional weirdos
---
Except our country is full of people who get angry and say "I'M NOT GONNA PAY FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S HEALTHCARE" while they write out that monthly check to their health insurance provider, which not only *IS* them paying for other peoples' health care (and other people paying for theirs as well) but also has a hefty bit of profit built in to make a metric fucktons of profit for the people at the top of that insurance company.
---
Windows 7 is ruined by updates, even a core 2 duo Pc should run win10.
---
I've been a PvE player for a long time, been wanting to try out WvW. I mainly run druid for T4's and Raids, but from what I've seen Druid isn't really useful for WvW. What are the easier classes to run and still be useful while i get used to it?
---
this is why you should think twice, that couple hundred dollars could pay your rent/ mortgage / whatever and buy your food for the week when you most need it. frivolous spending is not a good thing and trying to justify it is a bad idea
---
Very cool.
---
I have a question. I dont have 3D printer or dont know anyone that have one, so i will ask here.
---
How much would cost to 'buy' something like this?
---
I dont make and offer, just curious.
---
Lets say material cost + energy cost + your fee for printing.
---
Approximately.
---
Thnaks for answer.
---
I would like to see open world pve only have a racial skills being more powerful but is removed in instanced areas like fractals. 
---
There's a couple of tips I've recommended in the past to commanders on this that either get ignored or, in the case of commanders from the particular guild that camps this farm, I get berated for recommending a change to their pattern. Basically it boils down to any mobs that spawn outside of time based events can be scaled up to lootable champs. 
---
What does that mean?
---
A: Stacking at the edge or center of forts prior to capturing, before the mobs spawn, can spawn multiple lootable champs for the first fort (Red).
---
B: Dolyak escort spawns can be upscaled to lootable champs if enough players are present at the spawn location. 
---
with the mounts I think  D/D Daredevil Thief build is really dead for roaming, because you need your combo to unmount your target. :(
---
mainly the former
---
You'll need to reset the password.  Just provide as much information as possible (serial number helps but isn't necessary) and they'll help you.
---
Did you ever happen to sign onto your account on the website? Because the password should be saved in your browser 
---
Other than that, I'm not aware of any way to check your password through the client
---
Here is your subscription: Buy a $15 worth of gems each month. All your qol and xp boosts are than available from gem-store. Have a nice day, next!

http://global.ncsoft.com/global/ir/prfile.aspx?ID=883F09ED-6EE1-4677-A8AA-B227D0947D8E
---
Looks pretty lucrative to me. I love how you just jump in with the standard shitty criticism and fail to see how even though NCSoft is highly profitable... they just need to turn an even higher profit next quarter and the easiest way to achieve that is reducing costs at their studios i.e. layoffs.
---
You also completely overlook that this is not just ArenaNet. Several gaming studios have shut down recently or laid off staff. So instead of being a contrarian asshole, I'd love to see you clearly explain how ANet is so terrible at what they do and how what is going on here differs from the rest of the industry.
---
It's not like they haven't put out two award-winning, highly profitable MMOs.
---
Even though I'm not a norn main and love the Sylvari, Hoelbrak is by far my favorite capital city. It's much more beautiful than the rest and feels more like a place to come home to than a bustling city.
---
Queues today were a nightmare. I ended up just heading into EotM (for my first time!) since the wait for every map was 30+ people in queue. Managed to get all my dailies (all four available WvW) in EotM and only made it to 12th in queue for Eternal Battlegrounds before going to do PvE stuff instead lol
---
Well I do think that we will see new people. And I also hope that some will enjoy wvw and come back to it often. I discovered wvw 5 yrs ago when map completion required the wvw maps &amp; Im still there every other day XD.   
---
Bummer! Try contacting support and giving them whatever information you can, I know they've helped people recover accounts before even without the serial code
---
I agree with your point 100% :D
---
Yeah, in regards to rifles, I already have an ascended one so instead of getting a legendary cuz HMS takes so long and is so expensi, some time in the future I'll buy scarlet's rainbow
---
Green looks like it's HoT, blue is PoF, and Red (Salmon?) is whatever comes next 
---
I agree wholeheartedly. Couldn't say it better.
---
I feel you but it's a different issue altogether
---
You don't put a subscription in a 7 year old game with lackluster content releases in form of LW.
---
I have the Gilded Hollow and can say with certainty that there is a LOT more that you're missing.
---
I've tried to comb over everything myself, but there's even new things that I discover every blue moon. There are a few spots where you can go through walls and if you build to the very top, you can actually see the giant tree from the Dragon Stand map.
---
This looks pretty cool. Which sword is this.
---
I also love the color combination. I struggle for years now to find a fitting color combination on mine.
---
Assuming you won't be able to teleport them across empty space/air, on Xera, if you wanted to put them down and blow them up on the first platform so people would get the residual effects. On Xera at the 50% phase to ensure they're off CD by the time you get back to the main platform.
---
On Deimos, when people go down to the demon realm because spirits cause additional tears to spawn, adding pressure to your tank, oil, and hand kiters.
---
On Largos Twins, when you're going to a new platform. I guess you can land in the water to kill them, but you'll never get the achievement doing that.
---
Their next game is guild wars 3
---
Correct. Except that it's purple rather than blue and orange rather than red/salmon. Color is somewhat subjective anyways.
---
Good harvesting spots. Very practical and isn't a major discovery everyone must make themselves.
---
Personally, might as well spoil the Ley-Line Anomaly. I know there's an in-game way to locate it and that can be an achievement in itself, but I don't think it's particularly mind blowing event. Loot is good, and with any luck there's a good commander running it, showing her how squads should work.
---
I loved the world bosses when I started, so a good tour of where to find those could be a good idea. Don't forget to show the preceding events too. There'll always be plenty more to discover on her own, and by showing how a tiny event can lead to something epic, you might encourage her to discover things more actively on her own.
---
This applies a little more to the expansions (I'm sure she'll get there eventually), but as a still relatively new player myself, I strongly suggest trying the metas with her during the quiet hours. Give her an opportunity to learn the events at a manageable pace. Some guys run trains so fast even mounts get serious workout, and that may not be fun if you want more than just the rewards.
---
If enemy zerg has enough people on the ground to make it worthwhile for even 3 mounts (21 to 30 downed) they are already done for. Maybe 1 person might work for some situations but without evade frames on engage skills (idk if there is any), a mount with 12k hp/ 0 toughness will get destroyed by aoe before even finishing the engage skill in a zerg.
---
have an upvote lol
---
Thank you. The sword skin is called [Shimmering Sword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shimmering_Sword). the Colors are Indigo, Bloodstone Dark Indigo, Destroyer Orange, Perservance (for everything metallic). But here the exact tones were chosen by the artist.
---
This. Considering their other projects got cancelled, they need to make at least one more Gw2 expansion to fund another project. If they don't make another expansion both Gw2 and Anet will go down.
---
I left blacktide for desolation and now it's back 
---
Actions? What actions? 
---
Blackgate/Maguuma. How the mighty have fallen. Back when I was attempting to play WvW, those were the two biggest servers in that order.
---
Ohhh, ok, that's a bit faster than I want but that'll work.
---
Non-WvWers that play(ed) occasionally: A WvW point reset.
---
Not a big WvW player, so can anyone explain what 'World Linking" is?
---
Remember by buying gems you support NCSoft and reward them for layoffs. 
---
Still are, it's been blob hell with the two of them linked together. 
---
The music is some of my favourite in game too. [This bit](https://youtu.be/O13JhNkaSMg) is just lovely.
---
It isn't. The US spend much more *per capita* than anyone else, so the money is there. Geographical size can't be the reason either, since there are more sparsely populated countries which still have excellent public healthcare systems. It's just a question of political will - or the lack thereof.
---
OH MY GOD i remember doing this lmfao!! holy shit i totally forgot about this... such a blast from the past.
---
RIP TB.
---
It's really a testament after all these days that Guild Wars 2 still has the most well developed, stunning cities in any MMO. I remember how jaw dropping it was to see Divinity's Reach for the first time. 
---
Don't forget that we have double reward track progress for a week starting when the patch drops. So a few days of normal play drops to roughly one evening, especially if you also have at least one celebration booster or similar booster.
---
March 1st?
---
It says "2/22/2019"
---
Being last week..
---
Both SS and SA are worse for me on Deepstone. Getting pushed out/slipping out of platforms is extremely annoying. Birds are kind of annoying, but you can usually just cleave them down. You take some more damage, maybe got downed now and then, but that's all.
---
Give it time.  We might see caltrops traps to dismount people lol
---
They have to, wvw queues will be god awful. I bet even OS will be full.
---
Sorry, but I'm not the artist. Just as my album says, the artist is [Liche/Lichelet](http://lichelet.tumblr.com/) (nsfw obv.) I love her arts and she also draws Asura just perfectly.
---
Thanks, though the artist is [Liche/Lichelet](http://lichelet.tumblr.com/) (nsfw), she makes great arts and I just love the way she draws Asura.
---
The only kind of subscription I'd support would be an optional Gem subscription. That's it. Nothing other than a specified amount of Gems each month. Maybe a few more as a bonus for subscribing, so for example if you choose the 10€ subscription, you'd maybe get 900 gems instead of just 800.
---
Of course adding anything called a subscription could potentially look bad, so Anet needs to be very careful about making it super clear that it's *optional*, and that you only get Gems for it. Maybe don't even call it a subscription, but something else (I don't know what, though).
---
GW2 doesn't need a sub. GW2 needs a black lion trading company account level. More cash spent on your account for gems gives exp to a permanent account level with minimal boosts. It could be something like 1. magic find specific to black lion chests or increased black lion key drop rates, 2. increased chance to gather 2x or a rarer mat, 3. pve, pvp, exp and wvw exp, 4. improved ecto gambling odds etc.
---
It also would be interesting to see noob WvW players (who mainly play PvE) try to fight it out with each other not knowing what to actually do in a zerg v zerg fight.
---
Then there is a deeper hell for banner warrior who put their two banners at melee range of the boss and leaves no safe spot to drop your conjure weapon.
---
&gt; no WvW level needed
---
Except WvW skill points for masteries at least?  I think 126 total to max it out?
---
Now if only the two words were swapped... *Immobilizes Furries*.
---
No. No.
---
Im on same boat. I honestly hate ncsof for far longer than this, but all that aside , losing this guy and talking of restructuring, Ncsoft ppl are f’in morons.
---
Ill just leave this here, roman empire. 
---
Well after all that happened last week it makes sense they delayed this a week
---
How can , capitalism work and be called good system, while dedicated, skilled and awesome ppl , after giving so much in world they being benefit , end up making video statements like this, while useless over the top management of many same and similar companies are kept to drive it ?
---
There is something really broken in this world.
---
wvw rank
---
No, why would you put bacon on a cake? The round stuff is most likely marzipan. 
---
Like those piece of shit traps that the Forged have around their camps in PoF...  Hate those fucking things.
---
ah allright. Thanks for clearing that up :)
---
„So, doctor, do the results look any better?“ - „ Yes, all modified cells now have 15 stacks of confusion and agony. It should only be a matter of time.“
---
The whole health providers being signed up to be covered certain health insurance providers and plans doesn't seem like an exclusively government created problem but an artificial competing market designed by private companies to keep their prices up.
---
The only considerations to be made for a healthcare provider should be are how close they are and what specialists they have.
---
WvW-levels, gained through WvW-XP (or WXP for short). Only needed for the mount *masteries*, which are WvW masteries and therefore work only in WvW. So if you're not keen on doing actual WvW and only want the mount, you don't need the mastery points for masteries that are only useable in WvW anyway.
---
&gt; By the way, other developers should take notes about one the things he said: Developers being known is rare; so why was Josh known so much then? Because he communicated with the fans. What did he get in exchange of that? Lots of support and love by those same fans.
---
Hey, game dev here.
---
I'm gonna add some variables to this.
---
A) a lot of companies explicitly forbid interacting with fans. Even Josh was told to tone it down at some point, remember?  
---
B) there's a "survivor bias" at hand here. Josh is well-known and is a great guy, and I'm happy for him. I love everything he's done, I want all the best for him. For realsies. BUT he's an exception. Most of the times, when devs interact with "fans", it goes...A bit more south, let's say  
---
C) In many companies, you have community people who are supposed to be the point of interaction. By interacting yourself with the community, you may make their job harder, and/or ruin some of what they were working towards
---
Does this mean devs shouldn't interact? Hell no. I try to educate people as much as I can on many topics. But I'm specifically forbidding myself to interact in the community of the game I'm working on because of those reasons, and I've also decided to act under my (pre-existing) online persona, which is pretty much entirely unlinked to my IRL persona.
---
So yeah.
---
Bacon goes on everything
---
I prefer oldschool farming tactics, but I may do both this and farming unbound magic or volatile magic the old engi turret way.
---
I, however found a way to actively use turrets and still make a killing in magics both unbound and volatile. turrets in center, mortar pull everything to center point...Made an engi only guild dedicated to farming mobs this way for mats! we have a slew of undocumented areas! PM ME if interested!
---
Definitely. My thoughts are that they added these secret areas and ideals with the presumption that Guild Halls would be upgradeable with each expansion, which ended up not coming through fruition.
---
So they sit there for someone to explore and imagine what they could have been. It's almost magical to say the least.
---
Spotter and glyphs don't really have value in wvw. Heals, cleanses, stability, reflects, boon spam and aoe damage are much better in large scale fights and ranger sucks at all of those.
---
Yes you can do this in a right way given +inf time or [Continuum split], with source code/original dev or not. But you can't ETA on thing, that will fire you up. All or nothing?
---
Except that isn't what happened. They got themselves fired, Adults face personal consequences for their actions.
---
Herald and scourge. People depend on fb a lot and bad timing on some skills can wipe your whole group. 
---
OwO
---
In particular between those that have PoF and those who don't.
---
This person understands life
---
Wouldn't bet on it, seeing how most of the Republican people and a good majority of the Democrats are happy to sit on their mountains of money and upholding the status quo.
---
the ones next to the cake look like bloated finger/toe parts. My brain can't stop seeing them like that. 
---
&gt;Are support classes really that bad in WvW? 
---
Support classes are great in zergs. Druid, however, is not a very good support class *for WvW*. Firebrand (or even Core Guard if you don't have Firebrand), Scrapper, Tempest and Chrono (although this one fills more a Utility role that a full Support role imo) are great Support classes for zergs.
---
You said that the US needs public healthcare urgently? I mean I agree, but the relevance is lost on me.
---
If she has maps uncovered then do a World Bosses run.
---
Do a tour around harder jumping puzzles - Morgan's Spiral+Dark Reverie, Spekks's Laboratory, Goemm's Lab, Conundrum Cubed. Dungeons will be also available for her and that's quite good for introduction instanced content; most popular paths of AC, CoF and SE shouldn't be a problem. She should be able to rent a mount and do races in Core maps too. You can also just simply push personal story with her.
---
Orr and assault or defense of gods shrines could be impressive too but you gotta be lucky to land in map that has needed events progress.
---
Australia, Canada and many other countries provide everyone with health care and they continue to be thriving capitalist economies.
---
You realize that your current "system" - I dread to call it that - is costlier than what other countries have while providing **less** benefits?
---
And if you're now wondering how the fuck that could possibly happen, it's because everything is optimized for maximum corporate profit. A problem regulated and state-organized systems in many other countries don't have (to such a degree) because well, it's regulated and owned and/or operated by the state.
---
All that extra money just goes into the pockets of the 1%.
---
KAABOOOOMMM!!!
---
I might be wrong, but I head one of the main people in charge of those was one of the people laid off.
---
It says a lot that even the blundering we-are-still-the-mighty-commonwealth UK can easily outdo your country in something relying on politicians.
---
Never knew this, d seems like a weird choice but I guess it's referring to the last letter of the name. I assumed that /sq would be the abbreviation. 
---
#UwU
---
Tbh after knowing it I would still be rolling it. I mean, the purples! The illusions!
---
As somebody who loves playing my little gremlins. 
---
I'm fine with Asura sexy not being human sexy. Where they wouldn't wear something really what we'd consider attractive because it's not to them.
---
At the same time it's also player appeal to me. It may not fit but a lot of people obviously would like it. 
---
Though yeah, I'd love some more faces and gods sake more hairstyles.
---
I don't have static and I was being facetious - I know they are still the most popular choice, if only out of habits.
---
But my point still stand, Chrono&amp;Druid duo are less and less appealing in fractal each patch.
---
&gt; Support classes are great in zergs. Druid, however, is not a very good support class for WvW. Firebrand (or even Core Guard if you don't have Firebrand), Scrapper, Tempest and Chrono (although this one fills more a utility role that a full support role imo) are great support classes for zergs.
---
Thanks, that's a helpful explanation. 
---
Jup and the Bacon is Chocolate and Food Color
---
thanks, I still have to eat that xD
---
gross
---
What do you mean with "gearing at max level isn't too expensive"?
---
Since you're talking about account bound gear, you're talking about accended, right? Which is 200g a set or so? Times 9 + a few for wrong stats I call that \*very\* expensive.
---
This may be in america, in europe world linking is limited by language asociated to servers: international(english) servers only can link with international, french with french, german with german, and the spanish one with no one.
---
Oh, sure. It's fun. And at this point I might as well go on.
---
But I'm simply stuck at this point in the game. And I can't stick long enough with a single character to make any visible progress.
---
I'm still being called a detriment in PvE. (And I'm not looking forward to joining WvW because of their high demands, even if I am for the mount).
---
1. The US spends more on their military than the next top 8 countries military budget combined. It doesn‘t need to be that high, not even if we really go with the „US World Police, other countries apparently don‘t do their part idea.“ 2. Ok? Doesn‘t change the fact that it could be less?
---
3. this is another problem which should also be adressed by changes in the healthcare system. The US has the most expensive healthcare system in the western world and that‘s because it‘s so unregulated and capitalistic (I know the US hate regulations and love capitalism but if you want to protect your citizens then sometimes you need to regulate.)
---
Your taxes shouldn‘t be made higher, people who earn more than you should have higher taxes and companies should have higher taxes. The rich can afford private insurance while people like you need to turn every penny twice to survive. This is not what living in the developed world should be like. This is not how people live in any other western country.

Jump into Eternal Battlegrounds and look for a commander tag there :) Follow them around, and if they invite users to a discord / teamspeak server join if you can!
---
You will always find at least 1 helpful person who will clue you in :D
---
I know a lot of my guild that only turn GW2 on for WvW raid nights now :P The chat banter is keeping the gamemode alive XD
---
&gt; Season 2 can be played for free with someone who owns
---
Not an argument.
---
&gt; That saves around half of your estimate, just gotta wait for the right moment.
---
Yes, until the game dies and goes f2p I suppose.
---
Now that I'm getting into GW1 it's ridiculous how customisable that game's UI is. What happened when they made the new game, were they like, here's all this awesome tech, should we use it?, nah let's just chuck it out the window. (Same with build templates. Ok the trait and attribute system works completely in the two games, but if 3rd party websites can do it, so could ANet...)
---
Well this is GW2 and not ESO. GW2 have said from the very beginning that they will never have a sub. It is one of their backbones of the game that noone should have advantage by paying for it. 
---
And to be honest if you are a player who put time and effort in to a game you will have to get that VIP, Patron, Subsomething to stay on top of your game. Sure you can play without but as for players who really want to play the game and put time and effort do not want to be in disadvantage towards those who play, that is just the mind game that goes with such feature and something GW2 done very well to avoid. 
---
Thanks for reminding me of that movie 😂😂
---
You're tearing me apart, Lisa!
---
For nothing more than a cheap irl promo
---
Does Gandara need linked?
---
what does that mean?
---
Yeah, I think so too. I tried the jump pad thinking it would shoot you there in one go, but it took longer than I thought with multiple jumps involved. 
---
Thanks for the replies! 
---
Why elementalist cake tho? It looks like a gw2 cake to me
---
The cake is a lie!  ;-)
---
Happy birthday, in case it is now.
---
Thank you! I am home now, but I'll try that link at work. 
---
Ahh, I got it now. Bottom: blue water, left: earth, top: fire, right: wind.
---
100% yes.
---
lmao
---
The layoffs didn't happen because evil corporate capitalism. They happened because the project lot of these people were working at was cancelled, because those investing the money for its production decided it was no longer worth their time.
---
Why were those projects cancelled? NCSOFT looks pretty healthy, so it's not a money problem. What then? The projects were probably a mess, for a variety of reasons, and the milestones weren't completed on time, leading to investors not to trust how their money was being spent.
---
In a single word: Mismanagement.
---
You ain't doing no one a favor by comparing ArenaNet and NCSOFT to big asshole gaming companies like Activision Blizzard or Electronic Arts, who treat their employees like cattle and buy and close studios relentlessly just to exert market dominance, applying a burned ground policy rather than letting them go free.
---
The kind of services and employee benefits ArenaNet gave their people are far better than any of what those bigger corporations could give you, so again, it's not a fair comparison.
---
I don't know who is to blame for the whole situation, but what I do know for sure is that ArenaNet management had the responsibility for things to go well, and they didn't.
---
Looks like someone stopped aging mentally after 13.
---
Stop blaming NCSOFT for ArenaNet's mistakes.
---
If you want to blame NCSOFT for something, blame them for letting ArenaNet get mismanaged so much.
---
&gt; Yes you can do this in a right way given +inf time
---
Not infinite, just more of it... or a flexible timetable, this is the kind of thing where the value of an individual's skills matter. As well as your ability to read the situation, if they have no-one to take your place then you are not expendable, especially if whoever this hypothetical person asking for a fix is really cares as much about the fix and how it is done as you say.
---
&gt; But you can't ETA on thing, that will fire you up. All or nothing?
---
If someone demands an ETA of me that is impossible to be given with the information I have I will always say as much, and if they still want an ETA I'll give them a best guess, but I will also make sure they understand that is exactly what it is (well when it comes to software development anyways that applies to most ETAs given before any work is actually done, but still).

If in your mind honesty is guarantee to loosing your job, then you have had some really bad bosses and I feel for you.

In an ideal world, you'd be right, it's what I'm saying.
---
And really, what exactly *isn't* possibly polemic?
---
Sure thing, can't wait for the stale meta to turn into another stale meta warped around this mount.
---
A new meta is still better than just keeping the current one, especially if it means there's more to do in WvW.
---
Any design decision you can explain reasonably. If you can't, well, people will get angry because you're not doing your job right; but they will angry anyway even if you don't communicate, the problems will just grow bigger and explode on your face sooner or later.
---
Holy... You sure did do those wings justice. They look stunning!
---
Race largely does not matter, pick the one you like the most. Note though that there is a distinct lack of effort in adapting armor models to charr and asura, even some of their racial armor looks bad on them. Might consider that part if that's important for you.   
---
There are like two edge cases where racial abilities can potentially matter but they are extremely niche and should not really concern you.   
---
As for class selection, the balance is passably good and all classes have a couple of viable builds depending on the play mode. 
---
I crashes out of the game sometimes when I enter instances, whether it's story or dungeons or the Mistlock or fractals, this is the error file that arcdps provides, what does it mean? I've tried removing arcdps then reinstalling but still getting it.

I wouldn't mind monthly but if their focus is an expansion  could we get the rest of the story of the ley line rifts, with Weirdbringer, and the anomalies with the Shadowstone, plus some more consortium always wanna hear more about thier shady intentions

Considering it was some mobile game, not realy.
---
but i'm 22.

That doesn't work in 500 years old vampire loli hentai, it won't work here

The competition was so poorly handeled. Firstly they completely lock off the Entire EU community(twice now .. the app tea bs campaingn was NA only too) which is, or it seems it is, the biggest and most active branch of Gw2 playerbase. 
---
Secondly, they announced it and then .. nothing. No learderboards, no more followups, no one saw the winners, nothing. They could've instead spent that money in supporting content creators with their tournaments. 
---
These sort of things don't realy make sense and highly depend on gamemode.
---
The sadder part is that nobody cares anymore when back a year ago it would be a monstrous meme that BG would ever get a link and Mag would be up there as the only guys capable of destroying BG.
---
One year on and the server with 33% more population than any other link pair and the strongest on NA for years is low enough population for a link, and that link was the second strongest server for a while as well. 
---
These two servers also had the strongest and final bastions of WvW server identity even a year ago, and look where we are.
---
Servers on NA are 100% dead. Guilds are the only thing holding the population together. Bring on alliances soon, or you won't even have enough guilds to form alliances.

Some dudes claimed it boils down to 11% reduction in boon uptime from SoI but some other dudes claimed the changes also affected the rotation and the new rotation that might come from this change is clunkier.

Your question is one that our teams have certainly set out to answer since 2012.

No dont stop playing the game, call your government representative and literally send the message to them. This isn’t necessarily Anet or NCsofts fault, it’s the fault of our representatives to not build a system similar to for its positive aspects what LITERALLY every other industrialized nation in the world has built except the USA; which is a health care system that works for people. Anet and Ncsoft are simply playing by the rules of capitalism. Companies shouldn’t have to bear the weight of providing health care and workers shouldn’t have to suffer the consequences of things completely out of their control regarding company managment. The system can be so much better and it won’t happen unless we speak out and stop “invisibly protesting” and start talking to the right people, aka the people who are the decision makers. That’s just sales 101. Find the decision maker that matters. I wish the best to Josh and I’ll be finding ways to help him as he has helped all of us over the years.

Tell me more

It has perked up recently as people go in to learn a bit. 
---
For the average PvE player, WvW is a sea of unfamiliar skills, group dynamics, movement patterns, builds that make no sense from a PvE standpoint and following a commander who assumes you know what you're doing. 
---
EoTM has a reputation as being more chilled out so there has been an increase in activity. 
---
There was a time when EoTM was so active, and people had massive battles there, it was so awesome.
---
Google "Warclaw" and then get your sodium levels checked as you risk salt poisoning from stepping into the GW2 forum. 
---
Hehe. Did my comment on the previous one inspire you to make you this? :P
---
I can get you, but i personally feels like the true nature of an MMO game should be about being able to co-operate, and there's no place in this game rewarding like Silverwastes that makes you to do it. In any map you can achieve that amount of gold by perfectling playing together, maybe one time we can forget to be one and so to be all unite.
---
&gt; Don’t tell me you still gain satisfaction from killing that one FB trying to catch up to his Zerg?
---
Catching people wh stay behind is a valid tactic and can help your local commander, so yeah.
---
u/primordialtrade made it as a commission. Visit his user profile and you‘ll find everything. Yes, he did an incredible job.
---
Making the core game more interesting is not possible, atleast from my PoV. Expansion areas are alot nicer. You can just skip the entire thing with one of the level 80 boosts you got with the purchase from an expansion. (And do the story whenever you should feel like you missed something.)
---
Rev has the most diverse builds atm. Support, heal, dps and condi. Might be the class to start if you want that.
---
There is WvW guilds that do small group roaming, even some that also do raids with the same group asking in the wvw realms or in the according lfguild reddit and forums should make you able to find a group of people you enjoy playing with.
---
Maybe the game just isn't for you? You say you don't like the " piano game play " so I don't think it matters what class we suggest , you've already made your mind up.
---
You think this is funny? I offered you access to human servants, and STILL you lewd the Asura. I think we may need to accelerate our plans. If this is how you utilize your autonomy, we will take it away.   
---
My fellow Asura! Charge your death rays. Prepare your gas dischargers! Grab any and every invention required to bring these scum to heel! Look at what they pressured our sister into, LOOK AT HER! She now has to superfluous mounds on her chest, intended to please humans. This is outrageous! We exist to rule over humans, and they have reduced us to this!?   
---
Now we must ac- Oh my Alchemy, they bounce when she walks. They are like semi-spherical ears from this angle. Must observe more intently.
---
So, your comment about “only changed 6 times” intrigues me. As someone who played since the start of raiding... lemme help.
---
Zerk with knights w/ chrono runes and herald for f2= 721 setup.
---
Commander/zerk w/ chrono runes = mirror comp (5/5)
---
Minstrel meme thanks to teapot’s video = mirror comp, rotation goes more healing
---
SoI nerf/Leadership rune swap = tries to push damage, using mirror comp (will not type mirror comp anymore as is standard).  (Glory days of easy rotation. Sh5, wor, soi, repeat)
---
Food nerf (either before or after soi nerf, forget which) = rotation now includes swapping for soc buff more.
---
Alacrity now a boon = rotation swaps for new boon application. Damage rotation picks up again.
---
Mimic added to rotation somewhere, forget exactly where.
---
Rune/sigil rework = build and rotation switches again.
---
Chaos shatter chrono reigns supreme.
---
Diviner added = rotation and build switches slightly. SoI hit again. Small glory days as damage can now be higher. Death to chaos chrono.
---
3-5-19 BP = SoI will be hit again, causing another rotation and gear switch.
---
Not 6, I count 11 major changes. Sure a 100% BD setup works for most of the gear switches, and sure classes have rotation changes a lot... but it’s known chrono gets the worst of it. Piled on with, no one ever wants to gear the “expensive” chrono (seriously a 100 bd is not expensive if you shop around!), the mechanics they deal with, the thankless job it is, and the wait time for finding another one.. it just sucks the fun out. You can say “just don’t play it” or “who cares if you play it to 100% of its ability”... but that isn’t really a good attitude to have.
---
Everyone in a raid should be giving 100%. Chrono is no exception! Don’t wanna hear from people about chrono’s dps either. I literally just did a vale guardian tonight in magi armor (testing ele stuff on my legend set, forgot to switch back) and still dealt 7k dps, without having boons suffer (diviner trinkets minus back/aurora as they were magi, and diviner weapons. Rest was magi). Stop expecting chronos to be fine with 2-5k dps!!! And if we do expect chronos to pull weight... they gotta switch gear SOOOO MUCH to keep up.
---
It ain’t fair!
---
Wouldnt it have made more sense to make PoF the red color tho? You know, Fire, red, that kind of jazz
---
To be honest gw2 just does not sound like the game for you. You dont like playing against AI, standard pvp is boring for you as you dont like to play for fun but only for gear grind. Furthermore you want a complex class that has little buttons to press.
---
Thats just about 99% of gw2's content rejected, and for the last percent you'd need to do the other disliked content (levelling and gear prep to be good in wvw).
---
Right there with you. 
---
The only thing positive out of this is the pve bags and the forums blowing up about how unfair this is.
---
Still have my Shadowstone and my Rift Stabilizer... someday...

Bring on the pve bags

Thanks you

Venoms count as damage that you're doing, you can even see the numbers when allies are attacking. Vampiric aura is just a passive effect that doesnt affect participation at all, you need to actively do damage/support allies for participation.
---
As far as I am aware it is a damage threshold.  So with thief venoms when they apply your venom you see the damage tick therefore it counts towards participation.  If you dont see numbers of damage, you arent participating to the kill.
---
I teach in Thailand and almost every student has their own phone they play games on. Decent home computers are considered a luxury item, and although computer cafes exist for gaming, most young people here play mobile games with their friends. I think it's similar in China, and since China is a huge and growing market I think it's safe to say mobile gaming will not flop.

I see a comparative phenomena with this  like how people reacted... enthusiastically to Midna from twilight princess and her imp form. I for one support your plight.

conservatives government who are trying to destroy the NHS and make it so non functional you'll have to get private health insurance to receive doctors care and drugs like the US. They've already privatised much of it already into an unsustainable model, as well as cutting funding in a method called "starving the beast". Most of UK dentistry was privatised a few decades ago and has resulted in the entire nation having a reputation worldwide of having terrible dental health.

No. They should leave story content for expansions, and introducing more instanced content and revamping systems during the wait between expansions, like pretty much every other successful MMO does. Story and one time events won't help them increase the sales...

No thanks, an entire paragraph of stating-your-opinion-as-fact in the comments section of a comedic topic is not something to be taken seriously. That just plain ain't fun.
---
My guess is - when you mount for a first time on the map there is a lag where your character already moves, but you cannot see it and it's model just rides the ground (together with hitbox) where you mounted up. If you use engage skill without model and hitbox, you can pass through models as if you had some kind of cheaty ghost mode.
---
Source - I often use this glitch to auto-attack farm mobs from inside of obstacle where it's safe. (and I hope it gets fixed, as it irritates me like more times than it brings profit). 
---
&gt;spending time trying to scale events.
---
What time? You literally just have people take 2 seconds to stack up. Not to mention you can have multiple champs spawn which means multiple bags. It isn't taking any meaningful focus away from anything. You don't have to have people strictly following dolyaks around, just tell people to stack up on whatever ones happen to be nearby. They should be doing that anyway.
---
Well since devs get gag orders (josh got one after talking about the lost canthan district) I am not sure what you expect. It really is up to the company and we know from many devs that anet is very comfy handing out gag notices to devs the community liked even if they never caused any drama.

The AI is adjusted to the playerbase. Or rather the playerbase self-adjusts to the level of the AI over time. 
---
Oh yeah thanks, I've been doing all four of the meta events every day when I can, or at least VB, AB and TD because they happen one after another and are fairly quick and just spending whatever gold I get from selling materials on extra ones.

The thing about blade and soul is the fact that some classes require very low ping to be played. Its a game that was meant to be Korea only since koreans play on 9 ping. If anything B&amp;S will never work in NA where we dont have the luxury of 9 ping.

I said I find core Tyria boring, and that I **simply prefer** PvP to PvE. I asked about HoT and PoF zones and I didn't exclude end-game PvE anywhere in my post, as Dungeons, Franctals and Raids I find to be a nice addition. Nor did I say I play only for gear grind and not for fun. **NOR** did I say I want a complex class with little buttons to press.
---
I need a class choice advice based on my preferences and how these classes play at end-game, and possibly leveling advice on whether it can be made more engaging.
---
But yeah.. thanks for your outstandingly helpful comment...
---
YOU DARE QUESTION THE BFI?
---
I'm already contemplating whether I instantly want to start working on the new scepter but I think I'm going to have to take a break, it's consuming all of my game time at the moment. Those random alts I keep making aren't going to level themselves at this rate!
---
the wrong choice clearly
---
So are you saying that's what the combat is end-game as well?
---
I remember being like 15 playing this game when it came out. I thought the Asura were just a weird race of alien like beings. Turns out people see them as sexy children? Ya'll are the ones with the issue ffs.
---
X to doubt
---
My experience is that this takes a lot of time, I agree. I'm closest with ranger but seem to have fallen out of love with my daredevil. Still maintain that fashionwar though.
---
look i never said i could help, just that i was an adult
---
Yep we disabled it there because of weird bugs with vertical moving platforms.
---
Your doubts have grounds.. NA is unfortunately not magically different

Well on an actual serious note, I don’t think female asura would want their children’s teeth anywhere near them 
---
HIT EM UP HIT EM UP HIT EM UP
---
Nope, only bosses have more advanced AI, one of my biggest gripes with the game, especially given that it was literally an advertising point prelaunch that GW2 was a game where mobs "didn't just in a grid for a player to come by and kill them", a flagrant lie, like a lot of things stated about the game before anyone got their hands on it.
---
Both.
---
I think he means you bomb any enemies you see downed- I sure as hell do, I want their badges and loot

That system is fundamentally unsustainable and will crash and burn. The bubble is eventually gonna burst, and it seems to be approaching fast. At least for the AAA industry.
---
I really hope we get a norn expansion or living story arc in the future.  They're so cool and deserve to be more than over-passionate lugs, and bafoonish comic relief.
---
You shouldn't have groups of people typically. It doesn't take 2 seconds to stack up, you've got to have people actively group up in order to stack on those events.
---
Do not, I *repeat*, do not pull tactics without reason at all. *Use tactics if the Commander orders it*.

Vabbi Build is for large scale.

Did you know a good site for Roaming Build since you say Metabattle is not that good.
---
The FBI dude in the bottom right panel looks like he's about to break into the other dude in the bottom right panel.
---
For newbies, could you explain what "pull tactics" means in a WvW context? 
---
Something about terminology might be worth adding to my post...
---
Metabattle builds are fine for small scale (roaming) builds. 
---
Heh, then don't bother with it. Just play the game, have fun (or don't if you prefer that, I can't tell you what to do), and once you want to get into endgame content, these numbers might get interesting for you.

I can offer some insight into Elementalist gameplay. It's complexity depends on the spec you choose - I find weaver more fragile and more complex than tempest, but even then it depends on your playstyle and weapon choices. Staff is pretty slow and doesn't have much defensive skills, but you have the advantage of range (I personally find it a bit boring) whereas dagger/dagger is fast but a bit weak compared to alternatives. 
---
I enjoy scepter/warhorn or dagger/warhorn, because they're fast and fun without too much complexity, and I usually run a fresh air build, but you've also got auramancer which looks like it's gonna get a buff next patch - this revolves mostly around popping auras and detonating combos and its a bit tankier than the other choices. 
---
A lot of gameplay revolves around situational choices. I like Ele because it makes sense to me - fire/air are your big damage attunements that you'll spend most time in, then if you need some defense you can pop into earth, or if you need heals you pop into water - it just feels very logical to me, but again it depends on what you prefer. 
---
If you want more of a challenge, weaver (at least to me) is the harder spec. 
---
As for gear progression, you don't get the usual grind like other MMOs. but GW2 you grind more for appearance - the harder to get something is, the fancier it looks. I find it makes quite a nice replacement for the stat-grinding gear progression.
---
If you haven't already, have a look at Metabattle. They've got builds for all gamemodes and you can click through and see if any of them sound like your style. Then, after your character has made it through the ~5 min intro, you can go to the PVP lobby and play around with weapons and builds to see what feels fun at max level. I've made SO many throwaway characters just to have a play around - I have difficulty ever sticking to one character! Although, Elementalist is the one I always go back to.
---
I am not sure that even have a dedicated Mac team. 
---
By the way, have you ever had success with repairing the client using [ArenaNet instructions](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863008-Repairing-the-Game-Client)? I also get an error due to some missing libraries.
---
Thanks a lot :)
---
Dungeons is the big offender here. They are so broken/bugged/outdated that it hurts the game from a new player experience.  
---
  
---
But not just that, breakbars, proper tutorials, engine optimization, etc.  
---
Finally some invisible walls make things awkward in normal PvE maps while exploring. Anet should find another way to limit our characters, not just invisible walls. 
---
Flame turret+rocket boots+either a gyro for scrapper or the uhh, spinny holo thing. If holo then the big ol cannon for ult otherwise whatever you want situationally. 
---
Still would play it as condi instead of power but either way I guess. 
---
Clearly you didn't bother learning any of the new or better methods, because you're advocating playing doing it badly.  
---
SW as a map is capped at a much lower level of players than the others. You can't get that many more people than a full squad in there at all. Sorry, your suggestion is bad and makes maintaining the farm harder and makes it more likely for a rotation to fail and fuck up everyone's income for the rest of the hour.
---
&gt; You sound like you may be one of those commanders who treat it like some precise, methodical coordination 
---
Ironic. You're the one trying to change that fact.
---
&gt; You aren't getting players at every fort at all times, that would be  pointless considering the rebuild events no one takes part in. 
---
Nobody said they do, you clearly don't understand RIBA.
---
&gt; Not to mention, that still doesn't defend why no one ever stacks up when retaking Red. 
---
Because you can complete exactly one and a half cycles of chest farming during the downtime, starting from VW and finishing at Red, and that has you arrive at Red about 30 seconds after the event starts. It's better to complete that second half cycle and get another 5-10 chests than it is to stop and run across the map to red early and get 2 more champions. But I wouldn't expect you to know that, because you clearly have never spent any time or effort actually optimising the rotation so that the idiots who run in circles hitting mobs get as much gold as possible.
---
I was in the guild that invented RIBA. Get off my fucking lawn.
---
Metabattle is good. I'm really not sure why people say it isn't, though most people who do seem to be EU so it's probably due to the NA focus.
---
After intensive research, I have accomplished nothing of note. Will continue research. For science or whatever.
---
?
---
Well...Restructuring their western activities pretty means that this is exactly what their are doing unfortunately.  
---
I used to lead VW and was involved with a couple other Silverwastes farming guilds. One thing I liked to do that helps increase profits is assigning 1 or 2 of your more experienced/competent guild members as a chest scout during RIBA. I'd give them lieutenant rank in the squad so they could mark the chests they dig up. It helps teach other people on the map where the chest spawn locations are and encourages them to scout and dig as well. (Also useful to have those lieutenants there to mark chests that people dig up if they get to them before you do.)  Sometimes it is hard for newer farmers to find the chest spawns during RIBA phase, since all the mordrem mobs and vines make the landscape look different.
---
I'd also send a few magic find food, utilities, fireworks, etc  to 2 or 3 random people I saw rotating properly throughout the meta right before the Vinewrath fight as something fun to do and to thank them.
---
I’m sure she meant well
---
My favourite build to play is Heal Harold. All of that healing output can hide the pain.
---
SW didn't invent it, but I wouldn't expect you to know that either, given that you clearly never spent any time actually learning about it.

There are exactly three things that make a significant difference. Chest farm routes, timing of the initial rotation, and keeping the rotation alive. We found that the commander needed to tag down for the rotation phase because if people grouped up on the tag forts started to go down due to not enough people elsewhere in the rotation, and if you lose the rotation then you lose a large chunk of the value in the farm. We would lose the rotation at some point in about 1/2 to 1/3 of the times we ran with a comm tag, and we lost it less than once a day without one.  
---
Telling people to group up in RIBA rotation phase is actually the worst thing you can do. Letting them run mindlessly in a circle and hit things works far far better.

2 extra large one and 4 large ones?
---
Disturbing. Do it.
---
If you see two groups fighting in the arena in eotm, don't join in. They're probably scrimming or doing gvg in the upcoming tournament 
---
&gt;generally playing vs. the AI is not motivating enough for me), so in terms of my expectations of the game I'd say it's mostly going to do WvW.
---
&gt; [SPVP] but there's no gear progression whatsoever, which makes it get dull quickly[...] Just for.. fun.. I guess? Meh.
---
You exclude guard, ranger for lack of perceived complexit, but also exclude ele for being a piano class, hence my statement.
---
Which lead me to my statement that the game is just not for you if you dislike the majority of it. But if you are unsure, boost to lvl 80 if you got a boost, wonder around in HoT/PoF and if you dislike it delete it after 30min, takes little effort imo.

well,im glad i left my war last year,30 nerfs in year and 0 qol update or reworkS and now after half year,BOOM NO1 CAN PICK YOUR BANNERS,DO YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE,WE WORKED DAY AND NIGHT IN ANET TO BRINK YOU THIS AMAZING BALANCE CHANGE! SEE YOU NEXT YEAR!
---
Nothing changes in PvP.
---
Just post them with Systemchat / Combatlog active so noone can accuse you of hiding things and everyone can check out what's killing you just now. x)
---
Open world: expansion maps have higher difficulty than core maps, espacially HoT maps.
---
sPvP: while you don't enjoy it to the fullest you can use it to level chars (tomes of knowledge), improve your 1v1 skills in GW2 before entering WvW, get proper gear (exotics via reward-tracks or even ascended/legendary precursors via ranked currency), and test different specializations/builds before spending gold/other currencys, hero points and time to achieve a similar build for WvW
---
Since you have your account for over a year (guessing by your breaktimes mentioned) you can level quite easy using instant 20 or higher rolls. (except you deleted your old chars, which is never a good choice in GW2)
---
Guardian: can be high support im WvW (Firebrand) which is a must in current zerg meta, but can have huge impact on smaller "teamfights" as well (if played right).
---
As you stated GS and Hammer aren't your weapons of choice, so try some builds with sword/shield or mace, maybe they fit you more. For WvW you almost ever want to bring your staff in the 2nd slot for boons, Heal, cc-field, Condi-cleanse via lightfield+blast finisher..
---
Ranger: won't be accepted in most zergs, but as you mentioned, you aren't aiming for those anyway. Try out the "boon beast" build if you can! High mobility, often played with axe/axe + sword/warhorn (so no dull GS/LB action), some support capabilitys for group play (espacially with shared stances) 
---
I personally think it has something to do with addiction and whatever that keeps them at bay without them knowing it.
---
How the heck is 10 people stacking on a spawn long enough to upscale mobs going to make then stay there for an entire rotation? It's like 10 seconds man. Please stop exaggerating. 
---
Well... Time to work on those skirmish claim tickets. 
---
Well there are also secret cats in WvW, so it makes sense.
---
The warclaw does not fly, and has just a bit more health than a thief with no vitality and about the same armor as an elementalist with no toughness. 
---
Also, since they run slower on enemy territory, defenders will always be able to catch up to them, if they also run on warclaw. 
---
All you have to do is making sure you capture as much territory as possible and keep control over all of it, which is what WvW is mostly about.
---
Why is this down voted?
---
TL;DR? 
---
You just have learned that collisions and visuals do not match. 
---
The big problems all are. Wars, central banking, state power, spying, high regulation and taxation, militarization of police, drug war.
---
Are you an economist? or analyst of some sort?
---
i wish there was a huge market, especially for mmos like gw2 but the reality doesnt not quite reflect that.
---
If it's faster than a 25% movespeed boost in enemy zones (not fully convinced on that yet)
---
It's amazing what a couple weeks of gift-giving can do for multiple counts of public indecency.

---
Hey friend I, wasn’t being insulting and I wish you weren’t either.  I’m a GW2 player, just like you.
---
If anything, it might encourage more fighting to control territories. Or make it more strategic to capture some of the other areas to extend on the mounted return time.
---
It’s because the story is set in the past. They actually updated the story at some point to use the burnt, post-Scarlet but before current Lipns Arch, but it made no sense so they reverted it
---
you just have to ""git gud"" and then you are swimming in armors and weapons.  
---
i crafted about 3 sets before HoT and had the same feeling. but with HoT and raids it took about 1 year and suddenly i have 24 sets. across 14 chars, and the numbers are going up.  
---
so crafting is not mandatory at all if you want to gear your chars.
---
You hope your dps players are good and theirs are bad and try to tag during the "clean up" part of a fighter. Otherwise, yeah, you do just get less bags/tags/WxP as a support. 
---
If your only goal is to maximize your reward, you're better off hoping some other people play supports and just play a damage dealer.
---

---
I recently rolled a chronomancer as my second character to compliment my dps weaver.  I've decided to go full on heal/boon build, mostly because ive noticed a lot of pugs i join for fractals could use a healer.  I know chrono isnt as good as a druid heal wise, but i wanted to try something a little different.
---
My current plans are to use my weapons with tough/hp/concentration, armors will be tough/vit/hp and trinkets tough/hp/concentration.  Is this a good setup for a healer/boon chrono or should i go with more of a hybrid build and throw in some power?  Any suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
---
&gt; I don't play WvW but I know what the mount will do to WvW
---
no, you don't
---
&gt; massive life bar
---
and here is proof. in context, with no sources for replenishment of the health pool, the lack of toughness or other damage reducing factors, and the massive punishment for getting forcefully dismounted, 12k HP becomes rather insignificant fairly quickly.
---
I hadn't ever heard that, that's disappointing, same case as Black Desert Online if it's true.
---
I don't know if I believe that about the expansion though, to me HoT just seemed to massively increased HP, damage, and skill uptime for mobs;  I've never noticed any behavior that's made me their AI was more advanced.
---
I don’t play WvW, but I’m an expert. Source: trust me.
---
ESO doesn't do that, FFXIV doesn't do that, WoW doesn't do that. All of them have content updates that involve an expansion on the story. Especially FFXIV and ESO
---
I know the frustration from previous patches. No argument there. I've been pretty vocal about how annoying it has been. 
---
With the currently available stats(diviners), there's no reason you would have to re gear unless you were running the cheese build with no boon duration. The extra 3k dps on golem shows up as &lt;1k on most bosses and washes out based on rotation and whatever other job the chrono has to do.
---
I prefer group fights, even if small groups.
---
Roamers make new players leave. Roamers spend a lot of money on gearing up and for what? Just to find a poor elementalist trying to catch up with their zerg, who probably has exotic gear on and is in no way equipped to deal with a roamer? I have roamed in the past and it is usually very boring. I don't get kicks from killing someone who I know 100% I will kill as soon as I see them.
---
I hope this mount doesn't affect big fights and I hope it destroys roaming.
---
Luckily, this won't affect duels in any way.
---
We were stuck with that LA for years.
---
Not buying would be the end of ANet though, there's no win-win here.
---
They do seem to hand out conditions for often, but not like the spamming same cc that the undead threw out in Orr(since nerfed). I think the pathing for following a player is better too, but I have no way of comparing it.
---
This might be more of just seeing different abilities in addition to breakbar mechanics than actual AI changes, but the mobs in the expansions do seem more lively to me.
---
They could spend a solid year just overhauling the base game and I wouldn't complain, and I don't think many others would either, assuming that they released those changes throughout the year instead of having a year long update drought, THAT, players would complain about.
---
Does the event start for you at all and you just don't the reward? Because I definitely got that part of the collection...a week ago? 
---
What exactly is bugging out for you?
---
This kind of implies they sweat milk and the asura babies just lick it off though. 
---
And where's all the money they make from expansions, living world, and selling literally everything that's QOL (BAG SLOTS FFS, bank slots, etc.) as well as existing gem store content on top of making the stupid rotating inventory fake scarcity scheme
---
So many bigshots covered this game when it first came out, then it fell off. Hard.

---
It shouldn't really matter what you play in 90% of groups so long as you're not doing mediocre DPS -- like 9-10k burst when you have the support and boons to be doing 20-30k+ burst.  Reaper has a pretty straight-forward burst rotation, and while it's not as front-loaded as something like DH or Soulbeast that doesn't mean it's terrible -- it's just not top-tier.  Chm has you covered for class suggestions otherwise.  
---
That's just human nature.
---
PoF is about 3 warring factions, Balthazar's, Joko's, and Kralk's, and at the end of the day Balthazar and Joko were just obstacles to take care of Kralk ourselves. Also, living world season 4 is a package with PoF and a continuation of PoF. When PoF launched it was advertised that living world season 4 would essentially complete the rest of the expansion for us. Regardless, the most important point is that HoT has a green logo for Mordy and PoF has a purple/pink logo for Kralky.
---
Guardian is amazing! The damage burst on Dragonhunter is very powerful and easy to learn, and if you want to support your party you can go Firebrand for the hybrid Condi dps and support.
---
Core guardian is also very fun and powerful if you're not able to get the specializations right away.
---
Ranger is the class I fell in love with over all of the others, and I haven't looked back since.
---
Nice cake m8
---
If they want to focus on bringing in new players then killing dungeons, which is part of the levelling and pre-ascended experience, is not the right thing to do. There are so many collections and achievements for dungeons that every new player will want to do it, but will have a really hard time finding groups for it. 
---
That's extremely boring.
---
I don't trust sites that force me to turn off my adblocker.

Maybe they don't feed born children via milk? They come out of the vagina with the intelligence equivalent of human 10 year old. So i assume they are developed enough to just eat normally once born.

Either read that "little to zero toughness" part again or rethink your gear choices =)

Here is some art how I picture scourges on points in pvp. Damm shades do all the work while they just make sand castles.

You'll need boon duration since it's the main role of chrono anyway. A mix of harrier/magi (and maybe some minstrel pieces) should be pretty good.
---
„Fans like those who harassed Jessica Price and Peter Fries (who ArenaNet eventually caved in to, firing the pair) don’t define the whole community. Instead, events like these mean that people like Reddit users PhamyCaint and BluJasmine, who organised some of the gatherings, and Twitter user David33Bx who took pictures (including the one used in the header) of the attendees arranged in heart patterns, get to make their voices heard, and saying something nice for once.“
---
It’s the same community which organize these events, the key difference here is what the anet devs got laid off worked on our all favorite game and dident spend their time harassing its players.
---
The whole gw2 community is sad because our lovely devs got laid off, but we also were happy when jp got rightfully fired.
---
Rock paper shotgun is a nice example to just post bullshit to drive their agenda without even researching the topic.
---
Not something that can be done of your own accord, IP's are still roughly defined by home server, but there is no sure fire way of ending up on a different one, especially on maps that don't host world bosses/metas.
---
You can check the lfg, but given the map that chance is slim, or if you have friends or guildies on different servers you can try and get them to enter the map and see if you end up on different IP's.

FTFY

I think people started getting PvE meta builds from different sites like quantify and snowcrows, so people stopped recommending metabattle.  Their WvW builds are actually good though.  I've talked to commanders from very good guilds who say they direct people to metabattle for proper builds and people think that they're being trolled lol.  Apparently the guy who curates the WvW builds is legit.

---
Thank you for kind words.
---
Have not the music present, but try your luck with the gw1 soundtrack, especially from eye of the north. Many tracks in gw2 are from there.
---
&gt; it has three dodges and base armor. no, it doesn't take more damage than usual. there are WvW builds with less defense than the mount, and they have no issues surviving. the same goes for this mount.
---
No issues surviving, because of what? Right, because of their skills. The Mount don't have any defensive skills, only his 3 dodges. And these dodges aren't that long. 
---
&gt;which can be negated by using one stunbreak, whereas the attacker has to spend multiple cooldowns in order to force a dismount.
---
So the victim has to use (one of) his stunbreak(s) and is vulnerable to the attackers stun skills. The attacker on the other hand can also use the mounts engage skill, don't forget that. The engage skill has 2k base dmg plus 3 stacks bleeding). Maybe not a onehit, but it's something. 
---
&gt;nor can you ever catch up. mounts move at the same speed, assuming you and your target are in neutral territory. 
---
While moving at the same speed, the chaser will always be able to catch up, because the victim is forced to choose the way. There are some games (mostly minigames in games) where exactly this is the case. Catch up to someone who is faster or as fast as you.
---
&gt;if your target is on friendly territory, you'll never catch up since you move slower.
---
Yeah, and if your target is on your territory, it's slower, so he will never be able to flee. 
---
&gt;and even if you DO catch up, the only thing you can do is use the engage skill, which simultaneously dismounts you and forces you into combat, meaning that you can't mount up again, while your target escapes.
---
Not if you dismount him...
---
Autohits after dismount isn't that hard. ;)
---
&gt;still much longer than any normal dodges, even further than the daredevil dodge.
---
And **you** also have this dodges/leaps. Chasing is no problem here. 
---
&gt;that's before factoring in endurance recovery food. yes, those work on mounts. so with the proper food, this mount has FIVE dodges that you can use back to back. NOTHING can hope to keep up.
---
I'm sorry, but that's just **WRONG**. endurance recovery food **DO NOT** affect mounts endurance!
---
I tested it extensively several times (because of mount races). I even tested it again while writing this comment, just to be sure. Mount's endurance is **not** affected by food, vigor or anything else that increase the endurance recovery. 
---
This whole point is just *wrong*. You didn't even make sure, that what you are writing is true...
---
&gt;the actual "hard" change is that roaming and resupply denial is dead. this is a terrible change.
---
Since I can't change your mind and maybe I shouldn't even try, because it's not my task, everything left to say is: We will see. 
---
The mount isn't released yet, so we can't say for sure what will change and what don't. We can see in the stream that most "fears/critics" are not the case, but what exactly will change, we don't know. What we *do* know is, *if* the mount will hurt WvW, Anet will change it. Not by removing the mount, but maybe by things that are already suggested, lowering health, using a breakbar and stuff.  The mount won't kill WvW.
---
If you see a group that looks like its mostly the same guild but don't have a commander tag, they are not using it for a reason.  This is so they can get outnumbered fights without interference from other players.  Do not follow those hardcore WvW guilds/players.  You will die and they may yell at you for rallying the enemy players.  Nobody wins.  Not you or the guild.  If no commander is on the map and you see a group/zerg running around with no commander tag but the guild tags are mostly different, its more than likely just a bunch of randoms looking to kill or capture objectives together.
---
I had a really poor drop rate for it as well.  Eventually got it after taking a long break from daily node gathering there.
---
For a long time I thought the unlimited gathering tool I was using might of been bugging it out.  But it eventually dropped with that tool.
---
All I can really say is just mine a couple nodes every time you go to the map/every day.
---
Amazing guide! thank you so much for posting this!
---
Do you have exalted gathering unlocked?
---
Looks great :)
---
Don’t know if any unfortunately :(
---
Since you already have the ascended zerker for light armor, I’d recommend trying out a daredevil or deadeye. You can pull some big numbers and I don’t think either rotation is too ridiculous in learning the basics
---
This actually sounds incredibly Asuran. To be declared an adult you need to pass a written test, until then all your inventions become your parent's property.

I changed my mind : this warclaw is not a needed feature in its current iteration EXCEPT if you consider selling gemstore skin for the wvw mount.
---
So, Iam just going to play Something else  providing fun without  perpetual NERFS until you refocus your team on game FUN rather than BS gemstore skins for $.
---
I can see the moment a necro does that and gets their team nuked they get kicked and harrassed :(
---
Not good for the game.
---
It's your fault that I did.
---
&gt; See, with no insult to you at all, I think you're completely proving my point re: hardcore players not understanding how the game is for others. 
---
The way you keep putting this is so hollow. The fact that I'm making legendaries *now* doesn't negate the fact that for the overwhelming majority of my experience with GW2 *I was not*. If after 6 years I made my first legendary, do you really think that constitutes me being wealthy? I considered them to be extreme luxuries that weren't even worth picking up because I would much rather just work on gearing up different characters/roles.
---
It's not like I'm camping Istan/SW to farm out gold either. It's just passive accumulation over very extended periods of time while grinding my *other* goals or y'know, just playing for fun every now and again. I'm still not going out of my way to grind out anything aside from the occasional achievement/collection *which is completely optional*.
---
Or are you arguing that a new player should be able to say "I want a legendary" and then go grind it out in a few days?
---
How long did it take you to gear up a character? Seriously, share your experience. Because on paper I can look up the exact cost of making a full set of exotic/ascended and compare that against how many days out of a month you're able to complete your +2 daily, the average time it takes you to gather materials, etc. Off the top of my head I think Exo takes 3 days tops (faster with instant 80 goodies) and Ascended takes about 3 weeks (maybe 4 to factor in 0-500 crafting for the first time).
---
The days that I can run T4+CMs I walk away with ~+15-25 raw gold just from encryption chests. It's fantastic. I can pretty much fund a legendary every 3-4 months if I were to run them every single day, all the while working towards the long-term goal of Fractal God, random Fractal level achievements, and refining my skills across multiple roles. It's not a grind I'm setting out for, it's just gameplay I enjoy and it happens to pay out in a variety of side goals *and* raw gold.
---
**You're making this arbitrary case that the game is too grindy without ever specifying what your** (or the general hypothetical) **goal in the game is.** Want to just play casually, maybe run fractals a couple of times a month but mostly just come in to check out new story each month? Well, you could probably get by with mostly Exotic gear with a few yellows without having a problem. Is your goal to play T4 Fractals and work on achievements for story/living world zones? Ascended is probably your better bet. Want to raid? Exotic/Ascended is fine. WvW? Exotic/Ascended is fine. sPvP? Literally just load in and start playing.
---
There is so much to do in GW2 that it can be overwhelming. You have so much freedom in how you play the game and because it is so easy to become endgame ready you can just do whatever you're interested in at the moment. It almost sounds like you're putting forth the argument that because there is so much to do that it is a bad thing.
---
sidenote on wow: It helped that someone paid for the second account and I was regularly invited to help fill for good raid groups / people paid for transfers and such. It was definitely way too hardcore for what I could even consider doing now, but I never let it get in the way of school/grades/work.
---
&gt;This is part of why GW2 is slowly dying, so I guess GW2 can either continue as it is, and be in maintenance mode in a year or two, then shut down a year or two after that, or they can try and turn things around and make GW2 as evergreen as WoW has been.
---
Ah yes, the good ol' game is dying argument. The one never ever actually supports with any evidence and state as if it's fact. Well, I guess you can just get a head start on everyone else when you quit!

---
Honestly? That's a relief, would rather it launched under-tuned than the reverse. It means they're at least *trying* to be careful with the WvW ecosystem.
---
No dailies for them now, so lower participation. That's probably more connected to the sweepstakes and initial novelty, though.
---
I know some enemies used to dodge your attacks at launch, not sure if that's still around.
---
If we take a look at enemy AI in GW1 we can also be pretty sure it's been intentionally toned down in GW2.
---
Man, you gotta stop putting words in my mouth I never said.
---
I have an opinion, but if you haven't noticed after each class description I've **asked a question** about the class. So I want other opinions. I came to discuss that here, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered to post this in the first place. I don't need to tell you all if I had decided simply not to play the game. 
---
I haven't stated anywhere that I wish to change GW2. I described my opinion on some features, but I'm not concrete subborn on not changing my attitude, if the game met me half way down the road. Hence, I asked how is the gameplay endgame with these classes. If they are fun, engaging, if the open world PvE gets harder, so that it's not boring to develop my char (masteries and so on). 
---
Nowhere do you answer any of my particular questions, yet you're full of yourself enough to bend my initial OP, because maybe you're one of those who can't handle anyone who's preferences are differing.

Anet released a statement saying something about how the games not gonna die etc etc but we don't have any proof yet, just PR talk. it's logical to assume that given their unannounced projects have been cancelled they would renew their focus on GW2, but anet decisions defy logic half the time so we are just gonna have to wait and see what happens.
---
it's not really considered that successful anymore, it might be profitable, but profitable is not enough anymore, it needs to rake in the money to be considered successful. 
---
Can’t wait for stupid posts like this to disappear.
---
We're back in business baby. Had the password written down In a book of notes for the game I made when I first started playing.
---
A new map might help depending on the bug.
---
To get a fresh map, several ways for Snowden.
---
1.  Be ready for the patch Tuesday and jump in immediately after patching.
---
2.  Get a lot of ppl into the map and then all leave at once may trigger the low-pop switch message.
---
3.  Hope the guild puzzle is the one in the nw corner area (forget name) and a big guild shows up and forces a new instance (see #2).  
---
4.  Get lucky.
---
5.  Hope anet fixes it.
---
Most likely to happen of those, #1.
---
They are needed to craft scholar runes and nullification sigils.
---
Sure, it can help with those things, but then it also loses some damage just by adding it into the rotations. And that’s also pretty much renegade specific; power herald doesn’t output nearly as much healing without being specced into it and it doesn’t give any boons that aren’t already covered by others. Also don’t forget Daredevil’s amazing stolen skills and “barely-behind-deadeye” dps. Like I said, I don’t think anyone wants Herald or Renegade to be 35+k, but a solid 32 (at least for Herald) would be nice and it fails to even achieve that 
---
Forgive me (for this wasn't in the text), but is there only one(1) waypoint in EoTM? I ventured out just recently, must have been at a none peek time as the only comm there had just logged off for the night....and I was traversing quite far out (I thought) and did not bump into another waypoint? 
---
Scrapper doesn't tag very well. FB has no issues with tagging through retal, reflects and symbols. 
---
You'll need EoTM as well, but yes, 10 points will be pretty straight forward. You can buy some minipets for very cheap, and will often see people giving them away for free. Get a rare mini. Get a pet to level 20. Complete prophecies main story. Get a set of 15k armor. Pick up an Opressor weapon either from playing or buying one, and there's your 10 points. There's going to be other ways of getting 10 points, but those are fairly low effort. You will have to put some time into GW1, but the game still has all its charms. 
---
Can probably by-pass some of these if you have any friends or guildies who have minipets from years of playing or some gold/materials they can throw your way :) 
---
Ahh, makes sense. Thanks, appreciated! :)
---
O__o you did this on a phone? I have hard enough time checking reddit and discord *feels old*
---
Hm, unless they develop some sort of holographic keyboard, the movement and controls on a phone will always be limited. Either you're holding it, being able to only use 2-3 fingers at a time, for you're not holding it, but then it's kinda weird to use and not very confortable. 
---
And, by the time phones have that power, PCS will have virtual reality games fully grown and developed. 
---
:(
---
A mutated one or fed to much warcandy by travelers.
---
What? Ventari is meta for alacrity renegade in endgame PvE, and is considered a solid pick alongside firebrand to replace the chrono + druid support duo.
---
Base classes are almost always going to be underpowered unfortunately, that's just how elite specializations work.
---
Revenant  is the most limited class in terms of customization.  So having one legend /elite spec that works in SPvP and other game modes is very limiting. 
---
Revenant is the most limited class in terms of customization. So having one legend /elite spec that works in SPvP and other game modes is very limiting.
---
If there's one thing i've learned from doing raids its that the chronos sort of know what they're doing, the Druids are completely clueless and most of the DPS are just mashing buttons doing their best, it's not anywhere as stringent as it appears to be.
---
ventari renegade goes pretty well in fractals and ventari rev gets used in wvw abit for the sweet sweet alacrity and reflect.
---
I think boots made a ventari rev for pvp last year which was ok?
---
rev is mostly in a good spot, the next balance patch most likly going to bring back condi rev in pvp/wvw. so I think the only lacking area would be power rev in raids?
---
Nope. Happened to my friend the other day after he hit level 80, so after a while I had to take him through the pof opening mission and tell him to ignore everything. Massive oversight on their part... 
---
Or [this.](https://youtu.be/SEEwAvlJOcI?t=132)
---
Yes revenant is a bit limited in PvP but not realy more than some other classes.
---
Check snowcrows but wait a week. There will very likely be changes in Gear after Tuesday’s patch 
---
Awesome. Thanks for the tips. :D
---
"Column by Ed *Orr*" well that's not a good sign.
---
/s
---
yes, but choose folder you copy from carefully!
---
This is an incorrect line of thinking that a lot of people who want to get into raids fall for. Sure, raid discussions mostly include min maxed builds but min maxing is by no means necessary to complete raids. As an example, most power builds have used full zerker for years and sure some builds will change a few things here and there on Tuesday to min max but you will still be 100% fine to continue using full zerker on your power builds and still be capable of pulling enough dps to carry your weight.
---
Another example, Snow Crows website says the optimal (min maxed) team comp for Xera includes 7 Power Chronos for the current balance patch before Tuesday yet I have never seen that comp in action once and have seen Xera die a bunch of times because min maxed team comps are designed for highly co-ordinated groups looking to push their limits (these are the guys that generally clear a raid wing several times a week).
---
Going back to that "line of thinking", it's all bizarre even for a raid veteran like me. I see training/low li groups struggle on Cairn with 2 Druids and I recommend them to either take a 3rd healer or replace 1 Druid with an off meta healer yet they don't believe in my recommendation for whatever reason. Maybe because they saw some old video guide that had 2 Druids and believe it must be done that way?
---
If you truly want to get into raids then my recommendation to you is to find some training groups (I'm sure someone will swing by and give you some links to training groups) and be prepared to invest at least SOME time in wiping on a boss because it's perfectly normal for a group filled with mostly newbies to not succeed on their first attempt.
---
And now I lost all motivation to play this game, and that makes me kinda sad :(
---
Awwww! That little Asura-frog! 
---
I main a Revenant, obviously I enjoy the profession. It would be nice though if the Revenant had a role that it was great at. As it stands it has decent builds for most play styles but doesn’t isn’t really great at any of them. There is always a better or at least more desirable profession to take in its place. I haven’t gotten to the point where I can do high end fractals or raids just yet but everything I see on forums makes it sound like I may have trouble getting into groups or have insufficient DPS. I’m currently working on a power DPS build, only lacking my ascended weapons and shoulders and need to get my rotations down a little more but even then I hear my DPS will only be mid tier and I’m expecting to get some grief about it. Maybe I’m just putting to much stock into wha I read though I know that’s entirely possible but I’m open to tips if anyone has them.
---
Well if a power class does not crit, you are wasting all of your ferocity stats.  
---
Not that noticable when you are missing say 2%, but more serious lack of critchance will become significant.
---
Plaguedoctor came out in PoF, so you're stuck with it, I think. 
---
I had a similar issue with harrier gear and my druid and eventually decided to be a soulbeast instead. 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Not a mistake you'll make twice.
---
When an enemy zerg is pushing your group, new players naturally react by backpedaling and casting skills in front.  This is in fact the worst thing to do in such a situation.  Basically don't get run over by their melee train.  Luckily I have a very useful visual aid to show you what I mean.
---
https://youtu.be/hdZXlMl1xG4?t=36
---
1:20 is what you *should* do.  Roll to the side or even toward the direction they are coming from.  
---
1:30 is what will eventually happen if you keep backpedaling.
---
There are situations in which you want to go backward though.  When you do so, turn your camera and W key to run in the opposite direction instead of backpedaling.  Many skills can also be cast while not facing your target, so this is a good time to use those as well.  "Enable Free Camera" in the options menu lets you look in different directions while running.  Takes some getting used to, but super important for WvW and PvP.  
---
I am not sure of his WvW experience so far but damn does it seem far grimmer than mine. I play on piken and I find there is always something to do. Commanders are around in the morning and in the evening and if there are no tags there still plenty of swords to join.  
---
From the commanders I spoke with recently they are all really happy that PvE players are joining thr server since they all seem to realise that we do need more players.  
---
that was fun! time to go explore more areas!
---
As others have noted, revenant, despite being janky, weird, and lacking most all customizability, is actually pretty good at what it does!
---
Shiro-Glint is great (or at least reasonable) as a roaming +1 in sPvP, and a solid roamer in WvW.
---
Speaking of WvW, Jalis is a solid pick to add defense to the zerg when paired with Glint. There's been a higher number of condition renegades making an appearance and doing well as tougher roamers. They're giving life to Kalla and to Malyx.
---
Going back to sPvP, someone on EU I believe him legend last season playing a renegade.
---
And in PvE, Shiro, Glint, Kalla, Malyx all get used for dps.
---
Ventari is used anywhere you need healing! Plus alacrity setups.
---
Rev is great as part of the game! It's potential to fulfill a role isn't the issue. It's the mess that is the mechanics and weird weaknesses and energy and... other things that cause us all to think it needs work.
---
As a wvw player I disagree, nerf rev
---
The only things I can think of are [Bran Shrew's fan transcriptions from like, 7 years ago.](https://www.mediafire.com/BranShew7) But thats long before LA reborn/Lament. 
---
Perhaps reach out to people on youtube who have played or made their own covers and see if they have what you need? 
---

I think Aurene's hymn has been the only thing they've officially released sheet music for. Maybe get in touch with [Maclaine Diemer](https://twitter.com/maclainediemer) on twitter.

Missing the pocket FB, 9/10
---
When's this bad boy supposed to come out?
---
All the time. Once all the rams are up, tag usually calls "PvD" for anybody who isn't ranged or support.
---
As a herald with 25 might and 100% fury, I do about 1800 per second to the door with zero supply. This does 2000 per hit every, what, 3 seconds? For one supply per hit? Then we get to inner, or to the next objective, and you're out of supply? That makes exactly no sense.
---
I don't tag up often, but at these numbers, I'd be tempted to kick someone from squad for using a rope pull.
---
Exactly.
---
Can i ask , works for who ? For those 90% underpaid ppl or those 2% of rich ? For those so scared of communism , i wonder ... 
---
I mean, they have mammaries. It's just like most mammals they be flat unlike humans.

Can't go with none, you go with six! No less, maybe more.
---
EotM is a WvW map that is basically dead most times.  The idea here is that people wanting the new mount will flood there to get it instead of having to compete in actual WvW.  
---
Though from my limited reading on this at this point it sounds like you'll need at least some Skirmish tickets and you can only get those in the Borderland and Eternal Battleground maps.
---
hmmm
---
[https://youtu.be/IopO5hYOJOc?t=169](https://youtu.be/IopO5hYOJOc?t=169)
---
NO, because you'll need Eye of the North to even unlock the HoM
---
Meanwhile, Enmasse releases yet another stripper-tier costume for their little girl elin race and FBI is too afraid to even try. 
---
Personally, I will try to play WvW instead of EotM because I also want to get the legy backpack and the armor. It's a good way to farm it because there will be quite some activity... well the only problem will be the queue. :)
---
The entire ear attractiveness thing comes from [Oggy](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Oggy) and related interactions from EotN. The widespread of it, as well as the whole erogenous zone thing, is fully community-made.
---
i wouldn't say it's hard to master but go DH
---
not only you can precast your entire skill bar for max deeps and ignore most mechanics because of the block spam and op heal..but you are also extremely flexible
---
you can aegis your team, bring reflects if needed and even chip in some quickness..or provide the entire quickness even by swapping like 2 rings or something
---
oh and it's heavy armor too
---
soulbeast gets an honorable mention too since well..they're a beast in fractals and can be a bit supportive with a spirit or some stance sharing
---
however a lot of the skills will get you animation-locked 
---
i would advise against holo, their burst is pretty trash and because of modified ammunition your damage will vary a bit..it does have a boatload of cc though
---
weaver is paper but the damage is insane..it's not that easy to get started on but should be difficult to master
---
Man, folks really can't let some things go can they? I mean it's nice that people are taking notice of our community's heartfelt farewells/appreciation. But they still had to toss some shade in there anyway for good measure. 
---
But that "saying something nice for once" bit. Like did we all go silent for all the other days that aren't those two specific situation? I guess we just pull a Houdini and disappear until it's convenient. 
---
Since the season isn’t over you won’t see it in the gem shop. Instead go into your menu where you can select which story line you want to play and it’ll have an option to buy any episodes you are missing in the list.
---
More like shutter all of NCSoft and Anet. Lewd lolis is pretty much what kept the entire company afloat.
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
i mean at least give some details when asking such a subjective question
---
like dunno..what game mode do you play? do you care about being meta? do the curtains match the drapes? idk
---
Also tbh as soon as there are events in WvW who get PvE people to join many seem to loose their manner and think WvW is a toxic place and there for you will spend you next days spewing out shit in chat that will make the most bad trolls we have in Wvw look like a unicorn. 
---
So please don't make team chat painful. Respect that you who have played for 3 hour have very little knowledge about WvW and there for it will work a lot better if you follow the comander or follow some roamers and learn by watching and doing. And if things goes wrong scream behind your screen not in team chat. Thanks in advance.
---
Aside from a slightly off timeframe, I can't really see why you're getting downvoted for this... Pretty solid response. 
---
As for the time needed, I'd say \~1 month is more realistic with casual play. As much as people recommend against it, using laurels to buy first ascended rings/accessories doesn't hurt and gives a really easy +6 infusion slots. Armour and weapons are super easy to acquire if you have the gold (or are willing to gems-&gt;gold) to buy your way past 1/day crafting. Slowest part would just be the backpiece which has various methods of acquiring from LW map currencies to collections.
---
RPS can't post about ANet without dredging that bogus JPrice accusation back up, sadly.  Glad they at least made sure to highlight the support first.
---
Exactly true.
---
You get more XP from killing stuff that's been alive in the world for a long time. Stuff that's been recently killed gives less bonus XP.
---
When you kill something look at the numbers that pop up. You'll see a base Xp number and a  bonus XP. The bonus can be even three times what the base is. By going off road and killing those creatures, you'll level faster. Just test a couple of creatures when you go into a new area. If they have high bonus experience kill them all. 
---
You can also get food and utilties which are fairly cheap/easy to get that will give you bonus on kills. It's not that hard, just killing stuff with high XP to get a level every ten minutes if you're focused. It's not interesting to everyone but it's relatively fast.
---
Adding it to existing leveling strategies will absolutely level you faster.
---
Unless you have an absolutely amazing cooling setup, you should get the 8700k. You can easily overclock it to 4.5ghz with air cooling, and I’m sure a high end air cooler could get it to 4.8-4.9ghz with stable temps. With liquid you’ll be to 5.0ghz for sure
---
Gaile 😭
---
There cant be enough ear-lingerie!
---
And hopefully become WvWers :D

Next Tuesday

The towns are nicely made, I was rather impressed at how big they were, especially the big city Caledon(?) The housing is nice too, something we really lack. The world feels big, it feels detailed, although you don't get a real chance to notice it when you're grinding. There are forests of huge trees, swampy places, ruins, little hidden caves and all sorts of stuff to find. It's very much a fantastic job that their art department had on the scenery. Shame about the rest.
---
Did you make sure the other ArcDPS files are updated too? Specifically [build templates](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/x64/buildtemplates/) and [extras](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/x64/extras/) were both updated with the normal ArcDPS file last update. You also might want to download a new .ini file and see if resetting your settings helps at all.
---
*Cries in pre-searing theme
---
That.....isn't as bad as I thought it'd be.
---
Overall between one and the other you won't notice any difference so just get the one you think you can overclock better, if you don't plan to overclock just grab the 9700k since the benchmarks seem to be better in other games, and, as I said, for GW2 you won't notice a difference between the both.
---
&gt; I wonder how big the LWS content updates will be. Because if they won't add anything significant then I don't really see a bright future ahead for GW2.
---
 + we dont know when season 5 will start. maybe the gap between season 4 and 5 will be bigger
---
+ but we know that they already worked on some episodes of season 5 before the lay offs and the reshuffeling of teams
---
+ that means *if* all focus is now on gw2 again (and that is a big if), we will see that influence maybe later in season 5
---
Get the 9700k, single core performance is important in gw2.
---
You can, yes, though it will likely take a while, unless you find a benefactor to throw a lot of minis at you.  It will take some time of playing Prophecies just to get to a point where you can travel to Eye of the North and get access to the Hall of Monuments, and then more playing will be needed to earn further Tapestries and to actually perform the deeds/acquire the items needed to gain points.
---
But ten points isn't fifty points.  It's very doable if you're willing to put the time and effort in.  The max fifty points is impossible without all the games.
---
I'm sorry, this is a stupid question, but how do I download the .ini file? When I click the link at the website it opens up a page that looks like it came from a .txt file.
---
Having the item in your inventory isn't necessary.  If you have multiple weapon collections progressed to that point, the Heroic Font will give you a choice of which weapon you want progressed when you interact with it.
---
This one is obviously written for clicks only. Talking (again) about the JPrice gate is a nonsense here. For example. A bad one. mmorpg's linked in another post is better in my opinion.
---
Right click the link and pick "save link as..."
---
\*UPDATE\* - All is well, once I entered Kessex from the northeast as suggested.  TY!
---
That statement was made before they had their big shakeup, shut down their other projects, and brought people working on those other projects back to GW2 development. It doesn't tell us much about the current situation -- their plans may be very different now... or they may not. Who knows? Until they say something new on the subject, we really have no clue...
---
"Righfully fired" two words, all is said
---
And... Oh wait talking about JP again. rps are good at this it seems. -___-"
---
looks like they're just talking about season 4 going straight into season 5.
---
this is old news at this point
---
Honestly, I'd rather they poor that extra dev time into better stories.
---
Less childish, more gritty and dark like gw1 used to be.
---
These BS childish level of shallow stories is NOT what the guild wars franchise was built upon.
---
Don't forget that this interview happened when Anet's unannounced projects were still in the works. Now that those projects are dead, Anet could refocus their efforts on an expansion for GW2.
---
"not any time soon" said at august 2018. 
---
I mean if we keep LS5 in mind (wich is content until august-october 2020 -&gt; 2 years from his statement) "not any time soon" is realistic, even if an expansion comes right after LS5.
---
Given how big the expansion team was I highly doubt they have enough numbers for an expansion team and 3 LS teams now.
---
I can't believe this is true tbh. Like how crazy would you have to be, when you saw your biggest incomes were coming from expansions, that people are getting bored of LWS content updates especially when they're so long to come... to not do a third expansion. Especially when you have so many employees working on unannounced projects. I don't think it's true, this would be a suicidal move. I already found it to be a bad move to release mounts outside of expansions, if they're actually just throwing stuff for free while not doing an expansion to make some cash, then I don't understand anything at their plan. They would be so crazy to think LWS content updates and the gemshop would be enough to sustain 400 employees. This is too insane to be true tbh, I'm gonna go ahead and say this is not true. 
---
This statement seems to be taken out of context. ANET said no third expansion anytime soon. Which is true. We still have S5 ahead.
---
