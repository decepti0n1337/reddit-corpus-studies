Calling it now, we're going to get a voice clip of frustrated svanir and then they're going to into some badass female svanir like in the old concept art or in the story.  Exciting stuff.
---
---
---
Most of Jormag's champions do. Drakkar, the Dragonspawn, and others. But it's ultimately Jormag's voice that's being shared.
---
This is not what a "PSA" is.
---
PSA: Game is 7 years old. We know.
---
Thanks, internet explorer!
---
Yeah, I will miss it..
---
Not a very effective jail if you can just waypoint right out...
---
Yeah, something like that, or how Glint turned against Kralk after she was able to read mortal's minds and see their perspective/how we raised Aurene to value compassion and share the magic around.
---
she might be saying "Come, Drakkar. You are safe with me. Do you want to survive?" Are the norn currently hunting Drakkar?
---
It really wasn't, and isn't. I never played Vanilla (started in early TBC). My first experience with the game was on a private server, and I fell in love within a few hours. I obviously can't speak for everyone, but most of the people I introduced to classic had far better retention rates there than they did playing retail.
---
Sellers are tolerated and don't break any rules. Even though they sell their group place, they literally looking for people to join their group. That's exactly what the lfg is for, even though they are annoying. 
---

---
For guild recruits idk, but it's definitely different than spaming an advertising for a community event with multiple accounts.
---
Sinister gives a good amount of power. Good enough to get past the rare “boulder” fight
---
It's not repeated even though you are doing the same thing (pressing F on an object in the same spots) 3 times? For someone who brought up semantics you seem to be very poor with words.
---
Every one of the things I listed is something that is repetitive. At this point I'm convinced you either never completed the skyscale collection or you are intentionally ignoring my points.
---
It's [Team Yell](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Team_Yell).
---
I'm totally digging this in-our-heads vibe. I'm still hung up on Rox telling us that, when she was frozen, she felt like she was on a warm sunny beach. If Jormag is going to bring us into the psychological horror genre, I'm all for it.
---
My bet, sons of svanir will get pissed/surprised or dissapointed that the dragon they follow was a female one. And there will be probably some daughters of svanir organisation made up. Sons will cry and daughters will rise up and there will be a giant gender talk between them. Jormag will have it enough and she will kill her own minions and start anew as she will prove herself as one of good dragons
---
Who says there can't be room for both?
---
Bless you
---
A scavenger hunt is a scavenger hunt. Do you remember looking for and trying to find all the things we needed for collections in Ember Bay or Draconis Mons. Some of those collections were quite long and they weren't for an end of story mount. 
---
Rock collector was a collection with 60 firestone shards, and even though some people don't like the content, no one said it was repeated. It's just stuff hidden in close proximity to each other. In fact, that collection was worse because it wasn't telling a story. You just had to fly around a zone and find 60 things. It was a scavenger hunt.
---
Hitting f isn't repeating something. Hitting F is interacting iwth it once you've found it. Arguably, you could say that finding something is repeating something, but it is different things. Yes, they're back in the same areas, but it's still about 60 things scattered around an entire zone. 
---
You keep using the words ignoring your posts. I can read your posts and think you're wrong. That's not ignoring them...it's called disagreeing. I'm perfectly willing to accept that you have a different opinion even if I don't agree with it. You seem to be unwilling to accept mine.
---
The difference between us is you keep saying I'm ignoring you when I don't agree, as if I couldn't possibly disagree with your perfect opinion. I do disagree with it, I'm not ignoring you. And again that's okay.
---
Wing 4 Spoilers.
---
I think [](#s "Saul D'Allessio") is currently the best executed "villain" in Guild Wars 2 at the moment. Guild Wars 2's storytelling strengths has always lied in exploration-based environmental storytelling, demonstrated with event chains replacing traditional quests, the strong emphasis on world completion, the game's relatively fluid action and movement mechanics, and the game's world trying to match its predecessor (with some creative liberties).
---
This comes with the downside where the player's actions both in the open world and in story instances ultimately feel meaningless as regions are now (after LWS1) permanently locked in time, so the initial feeling of "exploration" is really as far as the story feels like it goes. It also doesn't help that the blank slate nature of GW2's MMO protagonist makes many of the protagonist's motivations feel pushed onto them.
---
Despite these flaws, Bastion of the Penitent is perhaps one of the strongest representations of the game's strength on that front at the moment, as the instance serves as both a physical and metaphorical manifestation of the villain's character arc at multiple stages, with the act of exploring and conquering the instance in the same way that the character arc is completed as well. In a way, the players, by learning about the villain, end up taking the role of the villain and completing his arc. It works on a lot of levels - the dive into the prison's energy with Scholar Glenna, discovering why the prison has fallen apart (with respect to the prison uprising), and going even further back, the historical context regarding the villain.
---
The wing also circumvents the normal downsides of GW2's environmental storytelling by playing into the exploration, portraying itself as unraveling the mystery of the wing (and thus, the villain) itself. The wing also dives into Guild Wars 2's deeper mysteries by playing into Guild Wars 1's relatively large material (the White Mantle and Mursaat, demons, etc.) while leaving a few for its own. This makes the instance (and consequently, the game) feel far larger than it physically is.
---
I feel like the elder dragons were meant to have been portrayed in a similar way, as the areas they control are both a physical and metaphorical manifestation of who they are (on one hand, literal animated body parts, on the other, their ambitions represented by how they affect the land). However, I think the dragons were perhaps a little too successful, making them a bit one-note.
---
I'd like to add that Wing 5 up to Dhuum is similarly good as Wing 4.
---
I'm going to guess shilling gw2 themed clothing
---
Lazarus was shit, i f only there was a way we could of left him alone in one path ends, and deal with him some other time. Maybe strike a deal as in be will show us where balthazar went as long as he is left alone scheming the stuff with his mantle friends. And all the shining blade stuff wouldnt of been necesarry cuz it ended up being irrelevant anyway
---
What do you mean? I just said that I enjoy napping during Fractals, which makes Jade Maw a very reenergizing, reinvigorating, and restful experience. /s
---
I did think it through. Typically, you could just be on the map and see where commanders are. Now, spying is incredibly important because you need to also infiltrate squads. I am not too sure how necessary it is given that WVW is absolutely dead, but spying was big in its prime.
---
origins has a way better story and much more choice than inquisition, the only things that inquisition does better is the graphics which is a given seeing as it was released 5 years after origins, the combat is subjective but origins was a lot more in depth and customisable and you had to plan and think about this a bit whereas inquisition just let you hack and slash through the whole game without much trouble
---
They'll cycle back in at some point, we just don't know when exactly
---
&gt; They said they're probably not gonna write a villain like Joko again
---
That could mean any number of things. How silly he was? How he's unable to die? How rooted in GW1 he was? etc.
---
You could type "-erp" and you wouldnt get any of these showing up.
---
&gt; Exactly, although I still say, people who want the old days of Vanilla wow they don't want that, they want their good old little memories back with their friends and stuff they did. 
---
That's just demonstrably wrong. I started in early Burning Crusade, and never played Vanilla. A few years ago when Warlords of Draenor started to show the cracks, I decided to try out a private server on a whim. As it turns out, I had a lot more fun playing there than I did in retail. Not by some small difference either - some months later, I was still having a blast and not bothering to log into retail anymore. In my months on that server, I made more new friends than I had in over *five years* of playing the main game, because the design of classic mandates social interaction and shared adversity, which is a recipe for building friendships. 
---
I went on to introduce several of my friends to Classic. People who had never played World of Warcraft before, in any form. They had a  great time. Eventually, they decided they wanted to check out the main game. At first they were big fans, taken in by the shiny new paint, the smooth combat, and so on. Two months later they were sick of the game, citing a total lack of social interaction, terrible writing, homogenized classes, and a pervasive lack of difficulty in anything other than high end raids and mythic+. It was basically a laundry list of the exact same shit people have been complaining about for years, diagnosed by a set of totally fresh eyes. 
---
We went back to playing classic private servers for a while, in spite of multiple server resets and wipes, before eventually deciding we'd rather wait for the official release after it was announced.
---
But those collections aren't the same. This collection requires you to circle the map in order to hit the same spots 3 times. The other collections you mentioned might have items in close proximity, but you can grab all of them at once and are not required to backtrack. Backtracking is lazy design, which is what sparked this discussion.
---
This "story" excuse is also quite tiring. Your "story" is one line of text giving context to why you need to run around the island 3 separate times. There's a "story" for why you collect the mursaat tokens in Ember Bay and the firestone in Draconis Mons. It's also not 60 things scattered across the entire zone. It's 20 things that are scattered across the zone that you pick up three times.
---
Maybe you are reading my posts but you certainly aren't acknowledging my points. If you aren't going to discuss my points, then you are ignoring them in the context of this being a discussion. If you have no intention of discussing with me then just stop responding.
---
Since this clearly won't go anywhere I'll just point out that I liked parts of this collection but there are definitely some lazily designed portions that made it unpleasant to complete. I criticize these bits because I don't want to see more of them. Overall, I felt the beetle collection was handled much better and offered a similar reward. Before you mention this mount being an "end of season reward" the actual utility of both mounts fits into a niche and so they are comparable even if one is much more annoying to acquire.
---
Definitely a clip worth viewing if anyone is wondering who Svanir and Drakkar are, and why they're important.
---
You just want to argue. You're makig the argument that circling one map is much different from circling any other map. Yes, you have to go back to the same area more than once, but I found that true with the rock collection as well. You throw 60 things in a zone many of them will be in the same area.  You're saying well you had to do one collection after the other so you had to go back to an area.   
---
This happens in almost every MMO I've ever played. It happens in the personal story where it constantly sent you back to Fort Trinity. You're making an arbitrary decision that finding a different thing in the same area, located in a slightly differnt place is the same as locating the same thing over and over. It's not..except in your mind. If you buy into the story it's different. If you don't, it isn't. It's that simple.
---
How can you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
Well I guess this is a big season 5 hint, thanks for the spoiler marketing team! :)
---
Ah now I see what you mean. Reproduced it and wrote a bug report (using /bug).
---
There is currently no reliable way to see which bugs are known since the [Known Issue Tracker](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/231272908-Known-Issue-Tracker) is known to be broken and would not even list all known issues if it would work.
---
i forgot they fought dragonspawn two times, later as full group. nvm then zojja can sleep some more
---
unorganized pugs almost never get silver. Maybe you've been in a map with an organized group and just didn't join any of them?
---
Nah. This whole time Jormag just eamted her own reverse harem.
---
as a general rule, if you're spamming your auto (and it's not for tag farming purposes) you're probably sucking really badly. even DD, who's dps comes from a lot of their auto, needs to use their dodges, signets and other skills to work well.
---
He was not being an elitist just because he stated a fact that is common knowledge for years now. Yes, that doesn't mean everyone has to knows it, but neither means this can be a PSA thread.
---
What's interesting is that this is an aspect thay Mordremoth shared too. Sadly the rushed state of HoT proved to ruin it. Hipefull ANet will do Jormag justice.
---
With all this talk about the new Mysterious Stranger, whispers and Jormag I feel this clip may help explain why this is important. I’m very curious about what is going to be happening next in the story with this recent development.
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Nornbear
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Drakkar
---
“Drakkar is one of many dormant champions of the Elder Ice Dragon Jormag that is trapped within the ice of Drakkar Lake. While it is trapped within the ice, it is still capable of utilizing its powers to "whisper" Jormag's influence and magical energy into those nearby. Drakkar was what turned Svanir into the Nornbear and caused Jora to lose her Norn ability to "become the bear."
---
&gt; please, i know you really wanna believe 1 narrative but try to be as objective as you can.
---
Dude, Joko is dead. No matter how many mental Gymnastics you use, we have actually story PROOF that Joko wasn't 100% immortal. Why is this still even being argued?
---
Just add the section to be able to queue for different pvp modes, JUST like with Stronghold and Conquest D:
---
Could also be that when dragons talk to us, they can sound similar. Kind of like how some people were saying that Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik sounded similar (I didn't think so, but eh)
---
Give in to Jormag. Listen. Come.
---
For Griffon, you need to first complete the Path of Fire stories, so in half a day i think. But for Griffon, some of them you need to complete a group event (Escort second spear in Desert Highlands), also some events happen in different time. So maybe 2 full days?  
---
Skyscale, complete the latest Living Episode, 3 hours i think. The collections, minus time gated one, required some team work. For example the reviving a dead player (or an NPC work too i think). You also need to do some exploring (Orr, Mini Dungeons, etc). 3 days i think?
---
Not sure how Aquatic Ruins qualifies as great. It's more exercise in adding unnecessary shit that makes the fractal longer but not more interesting. The dolphin change from a decoy to stealth is cool. Adding a bonus event of krait you have to kill is shit. Adding a "stop DPSing me" shield to the boss so you have to break away at every 25% is shit. Adding a bunch of random mobs to the hallway for no purpose except to keep you in combat is shit. 
---
I hope Anet never reworks Jade, because even though it's the most boring Fractal at the moment any rework is just going to make it 20 minutes long with a bunch of mechanics that are just as snoozeworthy.
---
Sounds like jormag saying stuff like “find me, I have power, tell them”
---
Like he(she?) wants the svanir to tell others it has power and gain more minions and find it and wake it up
---
&gt; You seem only interested in talking about a single stack even though the video I gave you above and my comment specifically refered to ID thousands of them.
---
it doesnt matter if we talk about one stack or 100 stacks of unids, the amount of time needed to ID/salvage them takes only a tiny fraction of the time it takes to farm them
---
&gt; Additionally, my proposed fix doesn't remove any of your choices, it just lets you make the choice faster with less inventory management. Not sure why your against that.
---
Where did I say I am against your suggestion? I just had a problem with your argument that the current system takes too much time to clear inventory instead of playing the game. But one issue I could see with your auto-salvage option is the extra lag it creates, if 150 players also auto-salve their unids while having a blob 3 way blob fight in wvw.
---
Considering what Jormag does in the "Edge of Destiny" book, I somehow doubt Jormag will be a good dragon. Your other points are pretty interesting, however.
---
I’ve recently been playing GW1 primarily for the lore experience, and as a GW2 player when I came to this scene I  got so fucking hyped
---
&gt; At this point the only thing to do in game is make legendaries.
---
or you could sell your unids/mats in order to turn your gold into gems to buy shinies there.
---
I just can't fathom that they're dedicating an entire 45 minute show to Living Story. There *has* to be something else.
---
Well, if Jormag starts using more of Mordremoth's mind tactics (assuming he gains Mordremoth's Mind spectrum in addition to parts of the Plant spectrum he's already acquired), we could see some truly nightmarish mental imagery like Aurene's [creepy vision cinematic](https://youtu.be/LINGfQKF1BA) of Mordremoth's Cronenberg-esque plan for the Commader's allies and Tyria in HoT.
---
And just for extra nightmarish kicks, enjoy this bit from *Edge of Destiny* where Queen Jennah stares into the Tormented abyss of Kralkatorrik's mind...and Kralkatorrik stares back at her:
---
&gt; Queen Jennah of Kryta, staring from a window high in Ebonhawke Keep, peered into the mind of darkness.  
---
&gt; It was unlike any she had wrestled before.  
---
&gt; A sandstorm. A chaos. Bottomless hunger. Endless outrage.  
---
&gt; She glimpsed it for just a moment, but that was enough. In that moment, it had glimpsed her.  
---
&gt; Crying out, Queen Jennah reeled back from the window. Countess Anise caught her, staring in dread at her queen.  
---
&gt; "That's what they look like," Jennah said, panting. Her eyes were like mirrors. "That's what it's like to look into the mind of a dragon."
---
Thanks for this.
---
All we know is they're announcing something(s), that season 5 is next and not an expansion, and that this is unusual for them to have an announcement like this.
---
Why are you arguing... both are good. And both can benefit each other.
---
Is the footage slightly sped up ? It doesn't look as good as it could've otherwise :/
---
I actually really like this and think if it's gonna happen with any dragon it should be Jormag.
---
If you listen to some of the ambient dialogue in Hoelbrak, the Norn are really \*open\* to the idea of Jormag being something like a Spirit of the Wild. Part of the reason the Svanir are allowed so much freedom is because the other Norn sort of \*get\* them, even if they disagree.
---
Imagine if someone made that musical in game.
---
Read the announcement blog post the picture literally says living world and the first 2 lines mentions living world.
---
I bit tho. I did upload some caves of this footage without speed up on YT as well ^^
---
I love them, well some of them. I totally dig the chess vibe they went for. I hate obsidian blade bits and would love fully chess like design. Shield is fantastic!
---
The most efficient way is to do the ls4 train meta that runs twice a day
---
if we do go north and fight jormag, i really hope they play with weather and cold mechanics more, i wanna see a blizzard similair to dry top :P
---
This might get burred but can anyone stick the sounds in a spectrogram? Sometimes audio engineers are sneaky and hide stuff in those. (Look at doom for example)
---
Abaddon and War God axes look pretty great. 
---
And Glacial Hammer is the best axe in the game.
---
Mirage axe is cool...but for my mirage, I prefer the phantasmal axe.
---
"Every whale who spends above the $10,000 mark Matt Mercer run a special D&amp;D session in their living room."
---
what i meant is he was 100% immortal and invulnerable, he could not be killed or destroyed by any means possible. and it was canon knowledge, not joko's lie. thats why im saying the writing was bad, because it didn't make sense that he died. if you reaaaally as a writer need to kill invulnerable character, you explore his secret to invulnerability and introduce a way to cancel his invulnerability and make him vulnerable. but then it means he wasn't truly invulnerable, just heavily protected. so still kinda bad, but it's the more acceptable approach
---
Maybe it’s a mix of Drakkar talking with Jormag itself in the background?(the female one)
---
Was it ever confirmed Drakkar was a champion of Jormag?
---
How is that you manage to never hit something? I can barely reach some speed without rubbing some weird obstacle.
---
**F**
---
Omg worth
---
Piece of advice, expect some clarification on season 5 but don't bring up your hopes up for much else. I'm not saying that cause I don't believe in anet, it's just from a practical standpoint going in wanting something will just lead to disappointment.
---

I think running events with my guild and generally talking with them while playing is my favourite part of the game really
---
So many people seem to dislike them, but I think they are really pretty.
---
That's mainly whybi was asking, this seemed unusual abut I honestly wasn't sure if the community knew any more. Honestly I'm not entirely sure what is meant by living story, but I think I understand now a little better
---
Fuck off, trash wvw player.
---
Jormag be a lady - maybe. 
---
I remember some ideas/early concept labeling Mordremoth as a "She"
---
[removed]
---
As a DD with no stability, Sprac is probably my least favorite of the bosses to tackle.  What is his tell?  I can kind of tell when it is, but I pretty often will dodge on a false start or do the dodge too late - I pressed dodge but am already being knocked back.  It doesn't help that sometimes I'm in the middle of a Weakening Charge, and as far as I can tell, I can't dodge in the middle of that attack - I can't cancel it if I started it.
---
it's my favourite because seeing the huge numbers on the last boss doesn't ever get old lol
---
She only was able to see the other side in a different light once the Forgotten purified her. Maybe our quest will be to purify Drakkar to replace Jormag?
---
Yes.
---
I always imagined Jormag to be the dragon of Spirit and Ice.
---
The voice and the voice lines really fit Jormag as the Dragon that corrupts. Unlike the other dragons the sons of svanir, searching for power, almost seemed to follow him/her willingly.
---
If we need to survive the Bitter Cold again, hope there's a more friendly solution.
---
However, I hope the same thing
---
Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice!!  I GOT THE SAME VIBES!!&lt;M KMLKSMNDLKASMdl;k
---
Honestly that whole lw chapter felt off.
---
I used to play Chrono at a semi-high level. As in having cleared every raidboss at least once whilst being the worst teammember good. Not being blamed for being the worst player failing CM100 good. But right after I took a break from the game, Signet of Inspiration stops copying my boons. Then I get into the game again and three days later it is announced Chrono loses shatter on self and distortion. I've been fumbling around in the overworld for a while, but I struggle to even find a decent PvE build. Basically I need someone to tell me how Chrono is played nowadays and if Chronos are even meta in fractals anymore.
---

Probably in that Joko was *too* powerful. Take away our Dragon Ex Machina GW2 would have ended right there.
---
“Mother....”
---
i have no clue what this is and im thoroughly creeped out now
---
Starting from 0 you need to farm up 250 gold for griffon and 250 of each season 4 map though so factor that in.
---
Hoid?!
---
Nice, congrats on that drop. You gonna keep them or sell on the TP?
---
Sadly chrono isn't really meta in fractals specifically anymore. You can still take it and you'll see pugs run it but running a firebrand and renegade is better now. Firebrand covers full quickness while having high DPS or heals and provides a lot of utility and renegade has good damage while providing team damage and CC (can also be run as a healer for less of a DPS drop). 
---
Chrono is still run in raids though, the SoI change just means you need boons on players first (tides now does both quickness and alacrity, both wells, timewarp, pack runes, etc) then you extend the duration on 10 targets (inspiration trait) with SoI and repeat. Honestly the main rotation hasn't changed in a long while now in raids. I'd check out [snowcrows' guide](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/) for more specific details, this is the [basic rotation](https://youtu.be/H1154AbvI34) and you'll find the  full one on the [build page](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/).
---
I don't understand why you think this is whining. I am presenting my perspective. I am presenting perspectives of people I know. It's different than your own. Leave it at that. I'll make sure to never comment on something like this again. This subreddit is a vocal minority and they are very vocal about shitting on people.
---
Yes, though its true name remains unknown.
---
What's the name of it?
---
Then they are smart. How many still play?
---
[Nice try ANet's disguised employee](https://media.giphy.com/media/EouEzI5bBR8uk/giphy.gif)
---
Yeah but in the gw version, there's two swirly things in the handle. Obviously unrelated.
---
Yeah I love all of mine as well. Given them personalities and stories of their own. Fashion wars the heck outta them, and now I'm running on zero transmutation charges. Every time I want to change something I have to take an alt to map complete the starting areas haha.
---
The closest to a Dervish in feel would probably actually be a Weaver. They have a similar buildup -&gt; explosive payoff through stacking elements that dervish had with stacking and tearing down enchantments, and has a variety of self buffs for offense and defense. 
---
Visually, daredevil would be closest, with a scythe skin and some Elonian armor.
---
"but now with GW2 go+, your spending is reset monthly, so you have to spend $10,000 every month or we shut the game down and everyones accounts with it. Love ya!"

Wow thanks so much! I discovered TaCo while farming map currencies for the scale and seriously, the amount of work you put into it is mindfuckingboggling.

Serious kudos! I didn't check when I was downloading but is there any way we can help you out or pay you back for all the work you've done?

I only own PoF and I was able to select Viper for my Renegade’s short bow and my scourge’s torch. Other than that, no.
---
I agree that we should have more modes. But if we have it in unranked what do you think would a portion of the community ask for next? Bringing it to ranked because "we already have it in unranked".
---
Legally it's probably different enough, but the artist who was "inspired"... well, that's a dick move and pretty lazy.
---
&gt; As soon as they realize
---
They won't.
---
* You literally can not permanently mess up your build. Every skill and trait is unlocked by end game, and they are swappable at anytime outside of combat
---
* Movement is important! Staying alive is a matter of active defenses; dodging, blocking, invulnerability, etc. Standing still and hoping to take everything is a good way to get yourself killed
---
* Hearts are not just quests, they're more like activity hubs. Around hearts, you tend to find things like dynamic events (repeating activities which give gold and exp) and explorable points. Each one of these points also gives exp, like vistas, points of interest, etc.
---
Can anyone tell me, whats wrong was about CI?
---
That's why Jokko was by far the best.
---
He interacted with us, taunted us and we saw just how evil he is.
---
The dragons may as well be oversized animals because their only real drive is Must eat Moar
---
Yeah but who cares about gaining XP from reading anybody at the end of a completed Fractal. It’s also very trivial
---
You can see [major releases here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release#Season_4) and [full updates from November on here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/November_2018). Main changes since November were:

---
finally some really good camera movement.
---
Key word PERMANENTLY destroy. He can be damaged. And dude, Joko (and his MAGIC) was consumed by a fucking dragon. That trumps physical immortality/regeneration. How do you not understand this. His death made sense.
---
And the dart board is on the ceiling
---
could be fun if they bunch of the mechanics we seen over the years from dry top storm, snow fractal darkness, cold from bitterfront and meld it together across a new region, perhaps you cant be outside during storms and need to travel underground or somewere in doors and wait it out, perhaps masterys will be tied into it so you could survive longer outside while a blizzards active, maybe kodans blessing isnt enough
---
could be fun utilizing torches/spells and shiny skins to light your path more, maybe masterys will give you the ability to see better in the dark, i just wanna see them play with the weather and environment more :P seems like an untapped area they have only toyed with a bit in the past
---
Oh you mean like being *consumed by a dragon?* Like that? Having your magic immortality taken away by a magic eater? Is that a good enough way to "cancel his invulnerability" ?
---
UI problems take ANet months to fix and new UI implements take months to add, it’s a little ridiculous honestly but nothing can be made that fast.
---
In a similar way to how we found that off-shoot of centaur civilization in the Wastes, but with a bit more impact on the story.
---
If you hate dragons then why did you buy a game that promo material said was centered around the Elder Dragons? You. *knew* what this game was about even at launch.
---
That's right, many players don't like heart quests. 
---
And you don't have to do them! Yey.
---
Events gives you more exp and also rewards, karma and money. They are marked with orange circles, arrows or points and have various chains, activation times or branches. And they also would force you to explore, find them and follow. 
---
Eventually when you reach your endgame and dig deep into various activities, you will be swimming in lvl tomes so most of the time you really lvl up only couple of your first heroes and try just instaboos others.
---
lol its not erotic roleplay, its Mighty Teapot and elitist raiding party lol. im hyped.

---
GW2 Mobile, here we come!
---
or a real sword that is the inspiration for both
---
are you sure you used the right word there?
---
Agreed. They've been paying off on so much missed potential of the past (Dragonfall basically giving you every way of attacking and Elder Dragon) and one thing I think the Path of Fire days have been lacking is that horror element. You got some of it from Joko but of a lesser variety.
---
The voice sounded like a female
---
GG people its Mighty Teapot.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GgGTsxqWWM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GgGTsxqWWM)
---
Yeah I really want them to do events for season 3 and 4. I’ve been impressed recently with how doable events in season 3 maps still are, but still
---
Bad internet connection could do that. Crash your game and leave a  black screen.
---
It probably even came from the same source. Most of the concept artists employed by ANet are freelance, Trion Worlds isn't in business anymore, I'm not sure Gamigo would hold any IP to their work. ANet tosses them a bone and asks for concept art, they dig out an old design that's free game - if you want a new one it'll cost extra.
---
Tbh this could probably be debunked by just scrounging for an art station profile that the sword was found on and you'd probably see commissioned with by ANet in there too.
---
i think i solved the whispers

---
This is the new playable race Anet will announce on September 30
---
The VB/AB/TD meta is really low on players, i think people are spread too thin, and many of the metas are failing. Too many things siphoning off people at the same time.
---
How did you find this? Are you a sword maker or something?
---
or you could just craft those marks instead for around 10-12 gold each? cost wise that's nothing when this game hands out gold like it's nothing.
---
I'd give ANet the benefit of the doubt that they went through the same freelancer. Does the rift wiki mention the artist anywhere?
---
Thats tempest
---
Hmm yeah that's kinda concerning.
---
Oh my god cinematic.   
---
   
---
What does it get more cinematic the less fps you get? Do you play GW2, fight a world boss and think "oh my god yes baby, finally some stutter and input lag, it's playable!"  
---
I think you should take some time to get used to it, or your display is fucked. You're literally the first person I've ever heard of that prefers more input lag and more apparent screen flicker.   
---
    
---
See, people prefer things for different reasons, that doesn't mean these reasons make sense, if he says "i like PS4 better because it's plug and play, already connected to my TV and i cba to plug my PC in / can't plug it in, I'd be like "yeah, that makes sense, have fun", but if someone comes around and says "hey this game is way too responsive for my brain so i get a headache or some shit and it looks cinematic when i get awful fps" then I don't.  
---
Boy I wonder how you'll react when you see stable 144hz / fps hahaha
---
The game is always a million time better when you’re playing with a friend :)
---
gw2 radial doesn't load up if I put it in bin64
---
Yeah that's umm great and all but aside from filler that's not exactly what people watch it for. A lot of the time it's the PvP or bossing that people watch and the personalities that come with it.
---
Guild wars 2 streamers that I've seen have jack shit viewer interaction or even a personality to begin with. A interesting person can make watching paint dry something more exciting.
---
Oh and shock and awe. Perhaps a wake up call here for some deluded clowns. The communities of the listed games are better formed... yeah including wow.
---
Godless looks Godlike! To my eyes!
---
Also, Shiro's minions from the end of that campaign.
---
joko says that we are the greatest villain of tyria, and i believe him
---
Im not fond of Warclaw, this mount 100% kill chasing fun, now zerg rarely stacking Swiftness, no need to use skills/utilities that can boost mobility/leaping/teleport anymore for chasing enemies :(
---
nice battlestar galactica memories.
---
Open tagging sucks. The fights are always never fun and one sided. The whole reason organized groups run invis is so they can get better fights. Outnumbered or even. Not this shit tier BG blob W-Key kinda crap.
---
I don't even know why the feature has been added so late. What guilds are even left to use it.
---
ERP is community-driven raiding tournament, *Elitist Raiding Party*, but the ERP can also stand for Erotic Role Play.
---
"Wow"
---
"That's quality armor"
---
"Thanks"
---
Is It that bad if I like the right one better? XD
---
A year later???
---
Oh boy now *that* is speculation
---
This is why I say the character bound stuff should be by character age.  Things like the dyes and level scrolls, teleport to friends, but the account stuff should be by account age.  Therefore, you could wipe out all your toons, but still get the account bday gifts.
---
It was clearly stated the changes needed to CI (or to mesmer in general) were to big to release it before the next balance patch . That's why it has been disabled .
---
The reason is : letting mesmer using this trait (even tho it has always been there) with the current mesmer state makes the devs worried about the state of pvp being not enjoyable for ppl (well less than it already was) and they do what they can to fix the problem while you are waiting for \*Fix\*
---
It has never been said it would have been fixed within 2 weeks. I invite you to take a look at this post on the GW2 forum:
---
 [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/83741/chaotic-interruption-temporarily-disabled-in-pvp#latest](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/83741/chaotic-interruption-temporarily-disabled-in-pvp#latest)
---
Fun Fact: There are 2 Curio Boxes you can get. One from PvE dailies and one from the [PvP reward track](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyrite_Curio_Box). There is a vast difference in the contents though. The PvE box gives you a decent shot at the rarer stuff while the PvP box is equal to opening 4-5 Zephyrite Boxes. Would've been nice for WvW/PvP to get a decent reward track item but we can't have that. The only thing we have in this game is PvE and open world content.
---
Lol pvp is already not enjoyable. I don’t love fighting warriors that dodge everything. I don’t love fight bunker eles. I don’t love fighting bunker firebrand. Tons of classes have annoying perks to them, but that’s the game. But oh well. Hopefully they change it and make it okay
---
Suspicious Traveler from another popular reddit thread right now
---
Please add one more point:
---
* Tag up if there are less than 6 tags and you can do it.
---

---
You just need to look for a scourge to be in your group. A scourge that knows what they're doing can carry any group through siren's
---
Ah yes, that's somewhat annoying.
---
Nobody cared when LFG full of raid sellers. Now when it is full of ERP spam (actual good thing for raids) everybody hate it.
---
Go find static. Become pro and make ERP 4 possible.
---
an old woman taking exclusively men into her grasp? sounds more like spirit of the cougar to me
---
How odd for them to actually thing ahead.
---
&gt; Did arena net not understand they had a huge amount of wvw players, and a pretty good amount of raiders to feed also?
---
I think its a mixture of not understanding what the game needs and devoting resources to the bulk of the game. WvW and raiders do make up a percentage of the game but they're eclipsed by the PvE open world population. I too am frustrated by Anets poor direction and mismanagement but I can't blame them. Create content for 15-20% of the game or create stuff for the 80%?
---
so.. the olmakhan?
---
Regular staff is actually good. For me it is 1-2 weapons from weapon set at best even LBT ones. Anet just bad at consistent design.
---
"Addicted anti-addiction Toggler" achivement - 20 tiers, 2\^(tier number) toggles per tier.
---
It's not too difficult, but extremely long and boring.
---
&gt; She's too pivotal to the Elder Dragon story for that.
---
Yes, exactly. That's why the finale made me believe she'll be just doing her elder dragon thing off the screen. The last cutscene was set up in a way to say she's too different on so many levels now. I think it either means we won't see her or we we'll get completely new relationship dynamic with her.
---
Although, come to think of it, Aurene's arc was going on for a very long time (LS2, HoT, LS3, PoF, LS4). I wouldn't be surprised to see Anet letting go of her for a while.
---
Which means it's **exactly** the correct design.
---
They give a bonus for doing what people would be doing anyway.
---
They don't punish others who don't want to / do their own thing, but they do incentivise them via the feeling of missing out. 
---
No systemic pressure to do X, just if you do Y you get slightly less, but it's still ok to do if you want to.
---
I feel that Elder Dragons as a concept have undergone a change, although the core ideas have always been there. It just takes paying attention to the story and not zoning out.
---
That being said, I'm hoping we focus more on Svanir and some such rather than fighting Jormag right away. It's not that I'm bored with them, but the Commander needs a break lmao
---
When do you use the defensive/damage mitigation abilities, like block or evade, in PvE  and PvP? When PvE idk if using them off cd is the right way to go about it, since I feel like I'm "wasting" them on regular attacks.. but I don't need to use them if I can evade after seeing the incoming damage markers.
---
Like I get it that I almost have no use for my 5k+ of tickets... but this set do not worth marks **+** 250 memory of battle **+** 5g. It is just 20-25? gold over the price any other ascended weapon... and they suck.
---
Anything that labeled balance is bad with Anet. Class balance, reward balance, content balance, communication balance...
---
It's pretty much considered a dead game for most WvW players atm.
---
The extremely simple pvp or the extremely simple bossing? Osrs combat has 0 depth
---
A.k.a. WoW ogre April fool's race.
---
Imagine it is 3 tokens for a box, i'd rather have seen them implement a 33% droprate for the bosses. If you farm its the same and its one less useless token and vendor. We have so many damn tokens in this game...
---
I haven't been playing for the last month, what sword is that (the non-Rift one)?
---
Collapse?
---
I sometimes get a feeling that vanilla Necro support is much more 'stable' than support Elementalist.
---
And the same reason (Norn Scourge doesn't fit at all) made me to create two supportive Necromancers' one human Scourge (condi-healing power build), and Norn vanilla necromancer (condi-healing power build too).
---
In the gemstore!
---
Yes, Gandara is rather mature in the core WvW community. Most of people at least 25+ with a lot of people over 30.
---
They could be referring to the mount adoption/mount select licenses, but those licenses don't appear to have any warclaw skins according to the wiki.
---
The anniversary sale list doesn't have a listing for warclaw skins by themselves, either.
---
It's not about inventivising current commanders to run open rather than hidden, but for more people to tag up and run an open tag. The target is people who do not tag up, or don't do so regularly, not hardcore folks who already complete diamond multiple times a week.
---
I still hate the fact they shit out tons and tons of outfits without any lore background attached to them to the gemstore..
---
See - thing is the input lag is objectively there. I think you should get checked out, because that's far from normal
---
Beating the personal story was nice. Getting the hang of fractals. Finally getting a proper build on my Holo condi and feeling like I know what I'm doing. Getting the hang of big meta events like triple trouble and dragons stand.
---
The best though, was getting to know my gf while playing. She introduced it to me when we first met and some of my earliest memories are of her keeping me alive in Ascalon, explaining to me what to do with all the crazy shit in my inventory so it didn't fill up, and just of us learning about each other. The game is fairly tedious to me, tbh. The fashion wars thing is kinda fun, and combat has some interesting stuff to it when I have to work for it, and the story ain't bad, but she's why I stick with it. It gives us something to do and as stupid as it sounds, seeing our characters together makes the distance not suck as much. It's been almost two years and we've met 4 times, 5 in a few weeks hopefully. I can't wait for her to move down.
---
I wish it has a "partical effect" upgrade...
---
What ? I need to sustain my fashion wars addiction !
---
It’s probably teapot himself
---
In both game modes it will usually come with experience over time when to use block or evade skills.  In pvp/wvw you will develop an eye for rotational timings the more you engage the enemy in solo and group combats.  This means that you must learn and respect the current meta builds of all the classes so you can develop a counter to them.  For pve, alot of the open world and endgame content have enemies that will signal big attacks before they are executed, giving you enough time to react.  Also, by game design, anet will always take into account ping timing from client to server and basic human reaction timing, which is about a half to a full second in total, which is sufficient to process what you are seeing.  Keep practicing and pay attention to your fights and you will get the hang of it.

---
New Epic Rap Battle in August 24 confirmed?
---
Jromag vs. TheDeepSeaDragon!
---
Bit of an open ende question here. I burnt out with the game at the end of LS4 and it coincided with me finishing my first legendary. I started the sky scale collection, but a lot of it was basically "do the same jumping puzzles you've just done for Spark" and the grind of it put me off, plus it's not super duper fun in and of itself. 
---
I've completed every map. I find raids more tedious than satisfying and find the grind of them off-putting. I am ballsy enough to say "do you want a chrono or do you want to wait?" which gets you into a surprising number of groups but the whole "you need to have competed 100 raids before you can play a raid" thing is something I don't have the mental space for. 
---
I checked out of fractals because of the repetition of it. 
---
I'll probably check back into the game for LS5 but until then I am feeling the lack of content.
---
What do? Any hidden gem stories or challenges out there? Any Caladbolg 2.0 or good costume unlock quests? The Istan Astral/Stellar one was great and the Elegy one was very good. Anything similar to that?
---
So we're going after another dragon.. great. There goes my hype and any last bit of optimism I had for the 30th
---
So everything working then?
---
Imagine the Svanir horror when the find out.
---
if it is the same artist anet should ask why he reused a already created art and only changed a few details, I think if they don´t know they artist might have a problem

Such a satisfying 3 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 though.
---
The threshold for full has been lowered after BG's demise
---
Personally I don't think that we will really deal with Elder dragons anymore. The whole story since the game began revolved around the threat of the elder dragons, to either get killed by them or killing ourselves by killing the elder dragons without a suitable replacement.
---
Now that Aurene is a suitable replacement there is not really something "interesting" about just going to the elder dragons and killing them entirely. Which would mean, just stabbing jormag and primordus, after finding them, until they are dead and finding bubbles first too.
---
For me, this plot isn't really that enticing, we already know the outcome to the story so there is only really one outcome out of it.
---
Another thing is, why would we stay in the deldrimor front which is in the southern shiverpeaks when we go after Jormag since jormag is in somewhere in the far shiverpeaks. As a start, maybe...
---
But still, Jormag and Primordus are pre-awakened state so they aren't really a threat anymore. Bubbles is no where to be seen or heard. So either we hear something about Bubbles and have to deal with him or we do something completely different. I'm more for the latter as I said above because the Elder dragon storyline seems to be concluded with Season 4. We have a replacement so there isn't really a threat anymore.
---
As for the Suspicious Traveler, this could be a hint to another Raid as we had with the lady in red for the Underworld Raid wing.
---
As far as storylines go, we could finally experience some unfinished stories like the other pale tree which might have been another "minion" of Mordremoth who could be pissed at us for killing his master. We could go to the charr homeland to deal with an uprising of the Flame legion. We could also go to Isles of Janthir to find more information for the Shining blade about the Mursaat. Or we could do something completely different I mean there is enough story and things they can do in GW2.
---
I found Zeghai of the Lost east of Greatheart Weald in Queensdale, on top of the Ettin cave. Says "Your mind is closed to the truth. I only spoeak to those who are familiar to the mists and who know how to manipulate them".
---
Should we compile these?
---
Really? To me it just looks like a worse version of noble count outfit.
---
Not that I would have anything against teapot or his community , but let this man just state his opinion maybe.
---
wow searing  look cool
---
does it change to the sword you have equiped?
---
Thats fine because thats why they gave you the choice to either spend a few extra clicks to directly salvage the mats before IDing, after IDing or selling the unids without IDing, everybody happy.
---
Teapot ( the host of the event ) did that multiple times on stream
---
It didn't work. There was only pain.
---
Calm down , everyone who can read will find a squad that suits him
---
nice :)
---
Maybe it will be. I wouldnt like to have gender talk in the middle of a dragon threat..
---
I thought micro-dives were bugged / patched out / not possible anymore? Are you cancelling them somehow or are they fixes?
---
Griffon guild? Damn, that sounds amazing. How can I join? Are there race beetle guilds too?
---
Also, the video is superb. I'm especially in awe of the last maneuver above the water - so much flair, with that camera swing towards the rising of the griffon. And the amount of skill to not touch a single metal rod or hanging rock jutting out in these caves is unbelievable.
---
Actually, sons of svanir are their own cult, and they brought it upon themselves to kill every female because they think they are weak, even when commander is female and you talk to them in hoelbrak they will express their hate for you. Icebrood or not. And apparently Jormag doesnt care about gender, but sons do.
---
&gt; Matches are won by who can stomp the enemy more and quicker.
---
Err... no? You're generally better off leaving them to bleed out.
---
Matches are won by the team who coordinates better, rotates better, etc. But Conquest sucks, give me more Stronghold.
---
I didn't want attention from Anet, I wanted attention from you.
---
I was just wondering if it's my game acting stupid or if it's a real thing :v
---
no it didnt, gosh you're trying so hard. are you anets fanboi or sth? 0 criticism? 
---
joko couldnt be damaged thats why he was imprisoned and order of whispers created. and if magic consuming ability was "his only weakness" then balthazar had him in his clutch first, yet he didnt consume him. dont try to make sense of this, its bad writing. i mean not like you're trying to apply common sense and logic anyway, all you say is "no it makes sense because DRAGON DUH"
---
If u buy this kit are any of these a guaranteed drop?
---
I'm in no way a PvPer so I can't really weigh in on this, but I'll say that I find it an absolute slog to watch nowadays because the 'time to kill' is so low. 
---
Back on release I remember watching a few tournaments and really liking it, you could see tactics actively change as fights dragged on, certain classes having the advantage the longer they could keep the enemy in combat, a 2V1 taking more than three seconds. It was fun to watch and really engaging. 
---
Nowadays if I'm spectating a match fights tend to be over before I can register them. 
---
I can't say if it's less or more skill based now, I only play one match a day for my dailies nowadays. Heck, maybe I'm just getting unlucky and seeing the worst of it whenever I watch a twitch stream, but I'll say I don't find it all that suprising that people don't tune into tournaments anymore. If I wanted to see combat that lasted seconds Id watch gameplay of a shooter, if I'm watching an RPG I'm more interested in when people are popping their heals and their buffs. 
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
This is entirely just to stop the Aquatic farm where organized teams instakilled the boss before joining a new party with the boss ready.
---
the leveling process in gw2 is ridiculously short compared to most other MMOs. many people like to consider it as a sort of tutorial phase, giving you an opportunity to slowly get familiar with many of the systems, without any real risk of messing anything up. that is also why you tend to hear the advice to not use the lvl 80 booster on your first toon. what unfortunately doesn't get mentioned as often, is that any further leveling experience can be quite easily and effectively accelerated, be it through some of the plenty XP boosts, or XP consumables.
---
That's useful! 
---
The Draconis Mons one is probably the one I'm furthest into because I spent a lot of time farming orchids there. I've 100%ed one of the maps, but I can't remember which... Maybe I'll put the time into getting the Rewinder before I take on the volcano jumping puzzle again. I agree, the LS3 maps are pretty awesome (Apart from Siren's Landing, which doesn't feel so refined...)
---
I don't really have a problem with repeating content, but it has to have a point to it for me, like I need an end goal. 
---
"Ad Infininum" feels like a very apt name for a fractal backpiece... but MMOs have a grind and I can accept that.
---
I have a bit of a mental block with raids, I think. The maps are extremely cool, but I don't really like the combat style of them. Mursaat Overseer is pretty cool but a lot of them just feel like a game of stand in position X until it's time to stand in position Y and press buttons in a pre-ordained sequence. I quite like Matthias and Sabitha, too, so maybe I just like ones where there is a lot going on. Some of the others just feel like Dance Dance Revolution.
---
To be honest, I forgot the side stories were there. Apart from the leyline anomalies, they don't exactly run up and present themselves to you. 
---
Anyway, thanks for the advice!
---
He'll do what he's told.
---
Imagine a guildwars with more than one streamer teaching raids to newbies
---
Jellyfish new mechanics are fine, its longer but good (adds bubbles to dodge and enemies to kill at certain stages to progess). However I don't like the champion guards they added at the end of dolphin run and deep water as it's hard to get most/all of the party there without dying.
---
Back six or seven years ago GW2 was a brand new game on the market. And despite no MMO being worth spit until at least five years in, gamers usually only play them for the first four before chasing a new shiny.
---
This is some major spoopage right here but the possibility that Jormag was female all along is *delicious*. Imagine the ass-blastery of the Svanir
---
As I said, this **could** be a hint, not that it is one. And I think it is more than possible to get another raid or even more raids in the future.
---
But sure, be that pessimistic.
---
Under what circumstances does an "on weapon swap" sigil effect proc if playing ele, if at all?
---
Searing is looking on point. I got a fire themed Elementalist that'd suit really well.
---
Clearly distinct silhouettes, color palette and texturing. Obviously inspired by the same source (most likely) or one from another, but there is nothing wrong with that.
---
If you want to make an issue out of this, then you'll have to make an issue out of most art out there. All art is clearly inspired by other things and if it looks original it usually means you haven't looked hard enough.
---
Player model quality performance impact is negligible in my experience.
---
This one can't just be passed off as concept art. A much cleaner weapon 3d model design should be entirely possible with that level of detail. 
---
Lately people have been passing it off as simple truth. That concept art will always look better and that models like this are fine.
---
Yes concept art can impart more details, but it's not like 3d is unable to. It is in general, simply unable to without affecting performance. However, this level of detail can be accomplished... but this is not what annoys me the most.
---
What annoys me the most is how they've completely butchered the whole shape proportion simply because they wanted to add some "glowy" effects on the edge *to potentially try sell more skins.* Color palette is also garbage compared to the rift concept art.
---
How high are clock speeds on the CPU and usage % on the GPU?
---
That looks like an ear infection, take it to your local vet!
---
This reminds me of the time a martial arts dojo was allegedly using the Guild Wars 2 dragon from the logo as their own logo because the artist they hired allegedly decided to use it.
---
Max of 4.3Ghz. Max usage of 80%
---
Ah, the armchair psychologist just had to comment, didn't he?
---
i'm sorry to inform you. He was joking.
---
As someone pointed out, the model [exists in Rift](https://telaradb.com/#/appearances/1554667221) and looks great.
---
What an arse, someone's going through all this effort to advertise in LFG and this 1 guy is trying to get people in their W3 fractal.
---
In my experience having more players that wear standard assets has a much much higher performance impact than having a few with the highest quality and the difference between a few with highest quality and a few with standard assets is very small.
---
It's to do with yesterday's patch.
---
&gt; Commanders can now choose to make their squads private. This option will make their commander tag invisible on the map, but it will still show up for their squad mates. Commanders who choose to keep their squad public will now get an extra 3 pips per tick.
---
So extra reward for those who display a commander tag.
---
Try to set everything to low and see if you are still on the same FPS than before.
---
none of 'em lmao
---
It wasn't even a question of forward thinking, it was just "i don't wanna *only* play elementalist" (or whatever their first class was)
---
On attunement swap or dropping bundles like conjured weapons. You can check all situations on wiki.
---
The only choices are furry, tall human, human, green human, and furry.
---
I agree that Joko situation is a mess, but I can't help but imagine Balthazar looking at Joko and thinking "Ew, gross. I'm not eating *that*. Put him in a cage or something!"
---
Great to see this pack get a tidier installation via the .taco file.
---
The only thing I'd like to see in future releases is a better categorization.
---
Currently, when you click "Filter Displayed Tactical Markers" selection, all of yours are displayed, while Tekkit's is within it's own category. It's a small thing (I hope) to see changed in the future.
---
It doesn't need the level of categorization as Tekkit's sub-categories but I like the tidiness of it all being in it's own directory.
---
Disgusting.
---
Thanks. I hope you hate it.
---
You welcome!
---
Yep already did before, even lowered the resolution still won't go past 35/36 FPS.
---
Well, you don't need to care about balance when your entire combat is rng
---
Player Housing like in Wildstar
---
Its really weird, i farmed the WvW track, cuz i thiught it would be the same box like the one from the dailys and when i finaly had them i previewed them and was kinda dissapointed that its actually just a normal box.
---
When is ERP?
---
Press F to progress.
---
If you play on EU I can invite you to it. My ingame name is Alcira.5816
---
And of courde there are beetle guilds. 
---
And thank you a lot! It did cost me hours to finish all those caves without hitting something xD
---
Thank you, I did not know this part of the lore
---
Green human is best human
---
but it's probably Drakkar's voice; the NPC all refer to Jormag as "he"
---
However you play it, I hope it has a good story, no grind and awesome rewards for zero effort otherwise i wont play it
---
Jormag
---
I'm still at fx-8350 xD What about world bosses 3600 performance like Teq?
---
They probably are massively upscaled because they are in the world boss area
---
when I put gw2Radial in base folder as d3d9.dll, d912pxy stops working
---
45/9
---
We don't even know if they're actually gods or just very powerful humans who acquired something transferrable that made them into gods. We clearly see Kormir taking power that left Abaddon's body in Nightfall, and a depowered Balth in a cutscene. If Kormir can do it to Abaddon I see no reason Grenth couldn't do it to Dhuum. IIRC Balthazar also did this to Menzies. So godhood doesn't seem to be anything special other than the powers you get. Also yeah Joko should have been imprisoned, possibly by some Ossa descendant to make it cyclical
---
I predict a Split, each races home base are under attack/ have a major problem of their own and the Pact has to split up to help theirs.  
---
I have as strange feeling Lion's Arch gonna be affected, majorly. Especially after the Festival of the Four Winds. A major tsunami wreck Lion's Arch and all sea side settlement. Bubble has arises, and she's pissed we been killing her kids.
---
I remember watching the tournament when bunker tempest and druid was meta. So much happening with no clear progress on who is winning what.
---
Erotic Roleplay, here I come
---
MightyShitpot :D
---
You don't need to buy anything to continue playing, though you won't be able to access the content from the expansions you don't have. The core game is free now.
---
i dont know how i can get a mount lol
---
Ahh, so mesmerizing
---
To me it's the color palette ( although I don't mind the one we got) and the yellow light effect (which I do mind) 
---
None of that has to do with concept art.
---
The base game is free (with a few restrictions). Once you buy one of the expansions, those restrictions are lifted and you get access to that esxpansion's Elite Specialisations (which are additional trait trees for the classes). 
---
You can get one expansion only, but of course you'd miss the other's story and maps plus the associated living world episodes (which you have to get for gems if you haven't logged in when they were around the first time).
---
For starters though, you and your friend should be fine with just the base game/the free version.
---
Hm, sounds like a thrilling build-up. I bet Jormag is going to launch some kind of surprise attack.
---
The travelers are unlike any of the Sons of Svanir in appearance, and historically only Jormag's highest champions could lure in norn with whispers of power. Maybe they'll release their disguise and nuke the areas they're in. Potential boss fights with them like the Side Stories bandit champs in and around Kryta?
---
Perhaps they'll reveal the lesser Spirits of the Wild that fell to Jormag were corrupted and we'll get a situation like in HoT where some of the race becomes corrupted against the Pact.
---
I wish this was a thing for 10 man and you could see boons applied.
---
It's not purely a numbers issue, it's an average player skill issue. When you replace a veteran that knows how to press buttons with one or two or even ten new players who don't know how to dodge, stun break, drop shades, etc, the game mode gets worse. The overwhelming majority of decent players would prefer to play mid-sized rvrs over map queue vs map queue, but it's hard to do the former when good groups are disbanding, good players are quitting, etc. At some point, being in a 20-man coordinated group that stomps uncoordinated full squads loses its appeal because your enemy becomes skill lag and stops being enemy player skill.
---
I could see there being a meta during a blizzard, and you have to move from lodge to lodge to warm up again before you set out for the next task. If you fail your party freezes and resets to the previous lodge. If the timer completely runs out, the map fails and everyone freezes into a block of ice.
---
Don't be stupid. Not everybody has played 7 years.
---
Hey now, it's not BG's fault that they have skilled players Kappa
---
I don't like this, but I'm listening to it anyway. Hello corruption
---
Thank you very much!
---
Yikes. Sorry for all the down votes! The reddit commuity just don't understand upvote/downvote anymore. It's unfortunate.
---
I promise the majority of the gw2 community isn't this bad typically. 
---
Glad you found this one. Everybody loves it.
---
Or, don't be stupid and assume your brand new discovery warrants a PSA in a 7 year old game.
---
You don't need to buy the expansions but you will have to if you want to have access to the content they bring with them. If you buy Heart of Thorns you can learn gliding, if you buy Path of Fire you can get mounts.
---
Since you bought the game when it released you would have to buy the expansions nonetheless because they are not included. The original game is included in the expansions to prevent players having to buy different boxes and not being able to play.
---
4 players on each team, 8 people playing total.
---
Three dice; all different ranges.
---
And a deck of cards.
---
Hmm...
---
Ok, hear me out:
---
**Joko’s Secret Gambit**
---
Items:
---
Cards numbered 1-20 (20 cards total) and the Dice as shown in the picture.
---
Goal:
---
Getting a higher point total than your opponent on the draw, giving your team a win, totalling (hopefully) more wins for you than them.
---
Process:
---
Each team draws one card - this card is drawn face down and not shown to anyone on their team or the opposing team - only the player that drew it can look.
---
Then, each team can either decide to:
---
1. Look at each of their team mates cards (only the captain looks at his teams cards; the players must still stay silent) 
---
OR
---
2. Ask the other team to reveal 2 of their players cards (again, only to the opposing captain).
---
This decision is made by whoever is in charge of the team this round (people take turns being captain each round) - a brief discussion may be had between team mates but you *cannot reveal your number yet*
---
You may say things like “I have a high number” or “my number is quite low” but *never say* “my number is 7” or “mine is the lowest it can be”
---
At this stage, no one has shown their cards to anyone else yet - players on their own team can literally say the wrong thing (bluffing) out loud to throw off the other team, but this could also confuse their captain - the choice is theirs.
---
Then, both team captains must announce their intention with a hand gesture; a spear point (all fingers together) means “show me your two cards” but a splayed hand means “I wish to learn of my own teams cards” - these gestures are revealed simultaneously to each other by the captains for all to see.
---
Now, each team must comply with whatever actions the captain chose - they either show their cards individually to their captain, or the team captain selects which two from the opposing team they wish to see.
---
**Your team captain now either knows their own strengths entirely, or two of the enemies strengths**
---
After this has been resolved, then the dice come in.
---
The teams once again confer, in general terms with each other, requesting that the captain allocate a dice roll (there are only three, as shown) to each player - or perhaps a player says “I don’t need it” (this could be another bluff aimed at the opposing team, but again could confuse your own captain).
---
Then, players on opposite sides (directly across from each other) announce they are about to reveal their card, and the captain must decide if he will put one of his three dice in front of that players card as a bonus for their total.
---
If a dice had been allocated, it gets rolled now by the player who it was allocated too - that number will be added to their revealed card.
---
Those two players now reveal their cards: who ever has the highest score wins that “dual”
---
Proceed with the same actions:
---
Next two (opposing) players announce they are about to reveal cards, captain deciding to allocate, if allocated dice then roll, players reveal, tabulate winner.
---
This happens with all players including the captains.
---
Whoever gets the most “wins” is the victor of the game - if their are two wins and two losses, the captains victory is the deciding factor.
---
**The whole time, the captain must be paying attention to not only what his own team are saying but also what the other team are saying, meaning his has to pay considerable attention to everything on the ‘battlefield’  at once - this also means the captain must be focused on remembering what everyone has shown them and make decisions accordingly**
---
*This is both a bluffing (the words) AND a memory (captain remembering cards) AND resource allocation (the dice) game rolled into one - anyone who is supposed to be leading an army needs to know how to use all three*
---
Final addendum:
---
If there is (statistically small but possible) a draw, a win to your team, a win to the other team, and then the captains ALSO draw (therefore providing an even split of “victories” across the board, the captains must immediately draw swords and fight to the death to determine the victor.
---
I never said this was a nice game.
---
I hear that eSport is still a thing in WoW, which will soon be 15 years old.
---
Yep. The sPvP scene was really strong toward the end of core and had been gaining momentum. Then HoT happened and it eviscerated the esports scene. No one wanted to play or watch games where two unkillable chronomancers sat on a point contesting it for 15 min and the game ended on the timer. Most of the second tier teams quit after a few weeks of that.
---
Thanks.  The wall of fire is painful for sure - You can't even dodge through it.  It still burns you.
---
HANGUPS IN THE SEX DUNGEON ARE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH!
---
dont forget little human
---
hopefully it will be like shadowbringers expansion announcement! good vibes good times!
---
Story wise I thinkk it will be pretty standard with fighting another dragon, probably Jormag.
---
Maps wise maybe not a new map every episode. Maybe there will be a new version of an exixsting map, changed with snow and ice. Maybe the borders expanded on another.
---
As for the "expansion level features". I think whatever they will be they will have to be heavily monetised. I don't think any feature that can't be monetised will make it in. 
---
The main thing that springs to mind is housing, which is somthing I am not fussed about. Maybe there will be a small zone housing instance. A few housing assets available in game, but the vast majority, and best looking ones in the cash shop.
---
Maybe some sort of vehicle is added, or boats. I think fishing is only a possibility if boats are added, as boat skins could be a thing.
---
I think new specs are a possibility, but I am not holding much hope. I also think if new specs are added there is a very real chance there is no expansion planned, as it would seem like parts of a prospective expansiona re being chopped up to deliver in the living world.
---
It may seem a bit cynical, but I sort of feel like the game is on full monetisation mode, adn new content is going to reflect that.
---
I think they are the racing goggles  - https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Racing_Goggles_(medium)
---
Dood these videos are pretty awesome but f me the first thing I do when it starts is mute it.
---
Cho'Gall from HotS then
---
thats why you play dh.
---
F3 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; 2, ez.
---
Because he did it wrong.
---
6 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 =  win
---
That’s normal. The game is trash.
---
Always associated Norns with Warriors or Guardians.
---
Mad king expansion here we come
---
The Norn spirit abilities in GW1 are top notch
---
Using them made you powerful and awesome
---
By the will of the High Legions, We...  
---
Will conquer thee!
---
Man… Guild Wars Universe always had some theory around dragons. And the Guild Wars 2 logo IS a dragon,  what did you expect ? A 200 meters Quaggan wanting to take its revenge against its brothers ?
---
1. make friends
---
Low pay and Trion hasn't existed for nearly a year? It's one thing to buy work and another thing to commission...
---
But what changed? If somebody really wanted not to be seen before, they could have done the catmander -&gt; no catmander tag pass and hide the tag.
---
I walked by then once when I was newer. Ever since then I always kill them no matter how many times I have to die.
---
It's not a stretch. Trion was founded by people who used to work at NCSOFT. You know, ANet's parent? So they were already from a niche circle in an already niche market. They probably were aware of similar resources until they moved to EA.
---
I'm a woman but never experienced any of that. Well I dont bring actively it up that I'm a woman though. But even if voice chatting in raids where my womanhood is obvious, I still haven't experienced that.
---
see how it glitches and clips. thats the quality you paid an extreme premium for......
---
Hello friends, this isn't me. I'll have this sorted out - although amusing, it's a bit excessive lol.
---
Name names, shame them on reddit :o
---
Never heard of such thing happening, sorry to hear that
---
Sure. Hit me up about that bridge!!
---
I was just imagining a bunch of new players getting defeated because they have no idea how the fractal works, probably trying to hit the Jade Maw and stuff.  They'll all need to be rezzed after the fight by whoever actually knows the fight to collect the chest.
---
Wait wat
---
A raid fullclear weekly and fractal cms+daily t4 everyday brings a lot of gold.
---
&gt; If you can't get at least a lot of what you want by working hard and putting in the time and effort in a fantasy game, what is the point of a  fantasy game? 
---
Sheesh, this scares the shit out of me.   
---
You are *not* playing a game just to *buy* stuff. You play a game to have fun.
---
With some relevant experience, I can say that (assuming that this wasn't the same artist working on two different projects) I would look, see that this tiny asset used in one non-significant place in another game's gem store and be\*at most\* mildly annoyed. Working as an artist on a large game like this is way different than trying to make it solo or working on a small team. This is too small to be even offended over.
---
Short answer: double the gold income for entire population, in 1 month prices for everything will double to reach new equilibrium, and in less than 1 month price for get/gold will double as well, to reach the same equilibrium. You win nothing beside causing economy wide inflation.
---
Honestly, the only time I ever found Boss Blitz fun was years ago when we were all on Teamspeak hanging out and chatting, and the Boss Blitz was just kind of a backdrop and a reason for people to get together rather than the source of the fun itself.
---
Nowadays, everyone treats each other like NPCs, just some faceless characters that help you get your loot. And it's like... to what end? It's not for fun... so many people, especially around these activites, are complaining that GW2 isn't fun anymore, so.. what is it? Loot? Playing unfun content so you can have more in-game currency in a game you don't have fun? What a wild concept.
---
I would rather work extra hours at work and convert gems to gold than grind/farm for hours on end in any game, it's way more time efficient and at least it doesn't make me bored of the game.
---
I thought I heard find sword
---
It seems the Glider is dyable but yeah Backpack not... come on ANET
---
Nonsense! Do not listen to this propaganda! Core is Mother. Core is Father. Core is Life!!
---
Also you could:
---
Focus 6
---
Weapon Swap
---
3 &gt; 4 &gt; 2
---
But 6 would activate retaliation as well, so I still say that's the combo to use :D
---
ok I know we are sad as a fans but we need to be real here.  
---
  
---
Its too similar.. we cant be delusuinal about it  
---
There were many cases of stolen anet art in the past, remember how reddit police was fust in pointing them and shaming them?  
---
This coulld be a new dev or an intern, and anet didnt want it. But now its too late and anet need to fix it before it go viral that game is in such a bad shape that devs are staling art from other games...   
---
Dev who did in need to face consequences and the item need to be deleted or changed as soon as possible.  
---
This is huge and anet need to act fast.
---
wtf
---
get a RL job, buy gems and convert them
---
Source is [here.](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/31986285/)
---
It's not the answer you want to hear, but you're not supposed to buy everything from the gem store with gold. The exchange rate is terrible on purpose to encourage you to use real money. If gold conversion was an efficient way to buy gem store items, how would anet get any revenue?
---
Not to mention that increasing gold income across the board will accomplish nothing except inflation, and trust me, you don't want that.
---
Makes perfect sense, given Scrappers spam Superspeed all the time, need to have protective eyewear.
---
it'll be a 45 minute presentation that basically costed them a quarter of the money that was supposed to be used on content already, to advertise a new "approach" for living world. am i saying it will be bad? no, but its literally not possible for it to be more than just living world if they are going to continue being consistent. i have a feeling 5 minutes will be spent on living world, and my dream is that the fact they actually have a full staff working on the game again means the rest of the presentation will be about how they plan on keeping the rest of the game from becoming completely dilapidated as it ages and remains abandoned. but we all know thats not going to happen, so maybe some updates to WvW, maybe 20 minutes spent talking about how impossible it was to make a 2v2 map AND code it correctly to put it into the queue in 2020 without burning down the entire office building. but again, probably a pipe dream
---
&gt;You can get every single item in the gemstore without spending more than a few minute in-game though.
---
How?
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem#Using_real-world_money
---
Well here’s to hoping it does happen!
---
Buying stuff is fun, and clearly I'm not alone in this or this game wouldn't be nicknamed "Fashion Wars". It's not to say buying things is the ONLY fun thing in the game, but it is a vital part of it for me.
---
Everytime your skills 1-5 change
---
There is, apparently, some precedent set for Jormag being able to mentally communicate even without mordy's mind powers. So either this is just normal communication, or Jormag is working with newly enhanced powers...
---
If the 2nd pic isn't a bug, it would have been fine had that been the way the mount looked when it launched, but to hotfix it after people have spent 2000 gems to get it?   Id expect to see some refund requests.
---
this is furry territory. turn back if you arent prepared
---
this is furry territory, not really sure how i feel about it, but the artwork itself is very good
---
How can you be sure since weve never had an interaction with Drakkar before? It seems just as plausible that its Jormag.
---
Counter-point: add more skins and rewards based on achievements and effort and obtainable through playing the game, *slightly* increase the ability to earn gold through in-game activities (I assume there's something inbetween 0 and doubling gold income), adjust gem store prices to account for the gold-to-gem price (gems used to be a lot cheaper and things in the gem store cost the same).
---
ah yes, the "technically i answered so hear me snivel and watch me snidely smirk, for today my IQ is superior" answer
---
I agree with both your point and your username.
---
Joko conquers everyone wins? Loses?
---
&gt; But even if voice chatting in raids where my womanhood is obvious, I still haven't experienced that.
---
Just say youre a 12 year old boy hehehe. Youd be surprised how many times I thought it was a girl playing and it turned out to be a little kid.
---
Congratulations. You beat a cutscene boss.
---
Look more like someone who is trying to foil the tournament. The ERP trailer is peak marketing performance by itself, better than anything made by ANET. I doubt that Tpot or any of his organizers would degrade themselves to this level.
---
where do people go to read this sort of news?  I always hear stuff like this secondhand.
---
This is hilarious.
---
First, if someone criticizes the theoretical post of yours of looking for a men’s only guild, that is also sexist. People should be able to play and feel comfortable.
---
I never said all men are bad; I am just saying that there are a few predatory men in each of the guilds I’ve tried that make me feel uncomfortable when I play. It’s not a problem with men in general. Your stat was pulled out of no where, and even then I can tell you, that is incredibly incorrect.
---
I don’t go out of my way to tell people; I play over voicechat and it’s quite obvious I’m female. I’m engaged and tend to play with my fiancé. These people go out of there way to private message me, even when I tell them I’m uncomfortable.
---
Have you heard about the word inflation?
---
when there is more gold in the game then every price will start to climb because the individual gold value will be lower. A single Glob of Ectoplasm will not cost 55s anymore but will cost more than a gold. That sounds great right? not really because the average player will not get more gold out of it but rather HAS TO FARM to be able to afford anything.
---
The only way to compensate this is by having sinks in the game that gobble up gold. currently this is only through the trading post since this directly takes 15% of each transaction out of the game.
---
&gt; I don't want everything right now, I want most things eventually for the appropriate amount of time and effort. And that's what I feel is currently not the case.
---
It is not? Suggesting to have a better and more efficient farm to get gold is not what this does. You want to be more efficient, which means earn more in less time, to get the stuff you want. What is efficiency really in this case? IMO it is about how fast you get to your goal so an efficient farm would be to generate that much gold to get what you want in the smallest amount of time.
---
In the end, you will only shoot yourself in the foot with things like this. Prices will increase while the average joe who doesn't farm will not be able to buy the simplest things, gem prices will increase significantly and everything will get bloated and in the end you will have to pay 1000 gold for something you have paid 100 gold before.
---
No need to change the plot that much. Remove the unmasking, and make Lazarus be the one who absorbs magic from Primordus, becoming infused with fire (much like the jade construct at Ember Bay).
---
Then we discover dragon magic isn't too different from god magic, so he's pretty much Balthazar-lite. He eventually finds his way into the Fissure of Woe, and takes over the forge, where he builds the Forged army using the souls trapped in the bloodstones (and a few White Mantle cultists), before invading Elona.
---
Joko's plot could be a bit different too. He would be our ally and then betray us once Lazarus is gone. He would emulate Lazarus and try to absorb Zhaitan's magic (using a mursaat artifact or whatever). Using that magic he would resurrect the fossilized insects of the original Scarab Plague, but we would stop it using fire.
---
Also, Lazarus would be slayed using Sohothin, Rurik's sword, for poetic justice, instead of the Shining Blade (which should never have been an actual sword in the first place).
---
There is a farming community who is running dragonfall daily, as far as I am aware. So this could be the reason why you are not seeing maps very often pop up randomly in the evening. The dedicated crowd is already pleased.
---
Scarlet was terrible, but in her defense, all of the story was kinda awful until LW2. She's a victim of poor storytelling, not unlike Trahearne.
---
Came here for this and you did not disappoint.
---
Praise Joko!
---
You can make some gold with crafting, too, but you gotta be pretty good at predicting the trade market for it.
---
The story is just an excuse for explosions and action, instead of the main driving force for the game.
---
Well actually the exchange rate is player made. I remember getting my first server change for 10g - &gt; gems, but since more players are exchanging gold for gems than the other way round the exchange rate went higher and higher over time.
---
But yeah I get most of my gem store stuff (which are account upgrades rather than skins mostly) buy supporting (cashing in) as it is "meant to be", too.
---
Look at firebrand tomes. The writing is in the wall.
---
What do we expect from a clown who did more marketing for the game than ANET? Hmm, dunno...how about make the biggest event in GW2, as in ever?
---
There is actually a scene in "Ghosts of Ascalon" with a syvari eating meat, and it kind of freaks out her party!
---
Gold is boring as shit.
---
Both races are fantastic (though I'm super biased for norn) and have to agree, with everything on the horizon, now is the time to go norn
---
and on first half a year 2000gems were 8 gold :')
---
MMO PvP is also not popular in general. The kind of people who like fast paced competition are usually going to be playing FPS games not high fantasy MMOs with a side of PvP
---
That's a shame, considering how much plotting went into the stories in GW1. It's almost like the games were written by completely different companies.
---
Probably the worst voice acting in the entire game
---
Scarlet was fucking fantastic. I know there are at least dozens of us who think so. Dozens!
---
This made my morning.
---
Did my krait daily today and was completely lost. Damn. Now I have to re-program my muscle memory again.
---
I had to do this years ago. I believe there is a place in your Amazon acct where you can view info on your downloaded games.
---
When did Istan get popular again? I still feel sick just reading the name and I havent been there since last summer or more.
---
Only issue is that the Forged specifically was just using souls (he got them from domain of the lost, not fissure of work) in a ritual that the Forgotten used to make exalted. Fissure of Woe would've been a stretch. Could've literally just been a matter of him ramping up the Jade construct process by applying souls to the equation. 
---
Heck could even play it the same way - literally just changing models, dialogue and sequence. Goes to Sirens Landing to seek out the magic, finds out he needs Forgotten rituals. Goes to Elona, uh oh he needs a key to get into Kesho, since there are no Forgotten left his plan is to go after the dragons that they used to serve. First the spear because it was least risky, then when it was destroyed he amped up production to attack people to get vlast to protect them. after that he used the commander as bait to get aurene finally. Boom, cue the desolation where he finally has exalted magic and he's making them in droves, with souls as a battery he's just jumping for joy. Finally get the drop on him and Kralkatorrik sniffs out the magic, and just to add insult to injury - Lazarus talks smack and says he'll kill the dragon himself, be reveled as a hero (confirming he's "changed his ways" by rewriting history like Joko has) before finally killing every last tyrian on the planet.
---
It could've been so cool and really played on a scheming game. But they went for that God damned switcheroo for no reason.
---
No female charr dress :(
---
I'll pass. I just do enough PvP each season to get through the Byzantium 6 chest for the ascended shards for the legendary armor. No way I am doing more for these skins.
---
some people try to make contact through a game and there is nothing wrong with that. some people do it at work, some in their hobby, some in their free time.  
---
simply tell them off and if they do not stop expose them in the guild? that probably stops it directly.  
---
was every single one of them really someone who started stalking you even after learning that you have a better half or is that just how you think it is?
---
I know :( it’s a shame that female charrs don’t get more “pretty” outfit options
---
Love the character :) so pretty
---

---
But on the flip side playing the TP reduces liquid gold, keeping the cost lower by lowering inflation (TP tax) also with copper skyrocketing in your example it puts the new players at an advantage too. They are salvaging their gear, exploring, mining copper nodes etc all which increases their gold supply. Same goes for anything, people eating up 20k +1 agony to make a +16 to flip keeps the +1 actively swinging near 1s instead of tanking into the 10c range.
---
This is perfect.
---
Thanks. This is my style a year ago. I just finished it today by fixing colouring mistakes and some other fixes.
---
Next season is going to focus on norn, so go norn for more immersion. Sylvari are not fond of the cold so they are in for a bad time
---
Except that 'bear' is not a polar bear. And from what we know Bear, Raven, Snow Leopard / Snow Lynx and Wolf are on equal footing in gw2 Lore (while bear seemed to be the most prominent in eotn).
---
I don't think Jormag is a female, it's just that the Sons of Svanir are dumb and retarded.
---
Jormag will get a new female norn champion, and she will kick the asses of everyone else, who will be forced to shut up and stop acting like children.
---
It's mainly the shitty fans that are the issues. The baiting and drama don't help but these are the people that used antisemitic language during WvW streams, racist insults at the end of the ARP and (though it is much less serious and contemptible) brigaded threads on this sub because their leader asked them to jump and the answer was "how high?". At this stage, as disappointing as it is, I'm not sure what else you can expect from that segment of the Twitch community.
---
I'm too much of an idiot to go raiding but color me interested in a raid dance.
---
Thanks everyone
---
No one is too much of an idiot to raid! Especially if you just treat it as a get together and dance off where you show off your flashy moves to get a boss down.
---
Wut
---
It's already show sheated, and it shows you wielding it, albeit in an idle pose, when you draw your weapon.
---
There's always the preview window to see how it will look wielded properly, but the biggest problem is that you can't preview duel wielding there.
---
What I’m about to do is nsfw
---
Last ERP peaked at more than 4k viewers, that's a lot of people not giving a fuck but still watching...
---
Night!
---
on release it was 80 silver for 400 gems :)  
---
simple economy inflation since also the conversation gold &lt;-&gt; gems is made to work like it by the devs. if there is more gold in the game, the prices overall will also go up.
---
Ah, guess that's true. It was mostly just formed due to magic driving everything crazy, but it's more just me assuming than anything else. Considering the dialogue during that fight, yeah I might be wrong.
---
I haven’t check that, but that would be a pretty look too :)
---
I'm glad people gets the joke.
---
Thanks! :)
---
&gt;Been a bit, but didn't Joko help him with something before we meet Joko?
---
yeah making him let his forged armies pass through elona. joko did that, then balthazar imprisoned him nowhere to be found, instead of taking his magic to become invulnerable.
---
&gt; Balthazar was crazy but he had honor. 
---
You couldn't go further from truth here. He has abandoned all honor, went rogue and started stealing ppl's souls and turning them into mindless contstructs, like dragon minions. that was the main plot line about why balthazar is a villain now. he wanted power and to dominate other gods for abandoning him. he had that power in his grasp. but writers didn't know by then they wanted to make joko vulnerable - they only thought of this idea when designing aurene's storyline. this is why it's bad writing. inconsistency
---
There is only two males. :)
---
At the very least Core is great underwater. Better than most elite specs which give nothing underwater and only take up a useful trait spot. (Then again, could just be the elite specs I play with)
---
I love these videos. You make it look so easy too, however whenever I try I look more like [this](https://media.giphy.com/media/GbIHIHhkgfpAs/giphy.gif)

Never quite got that last part down, but I did have fun with a previous guild during training nights. I performed terribly but it they were good fun. Never found anyone I clicked enough with to try again after the guild went inactive.
---
I'll end you someday, Cairn ! *shakes fist at... LA's raid hub, probably.*
---
I think they mean "leaving the mists into another world" since the mists is also the "space between the worlds". 
---
We know there is minimum one world from where the gods brought humans into Tyria. Since the last LS episode we know that Melandru has her own domain, maybe a whole world like Tyria, maybe something like the Underworld or the Fissure of Woe. I think they went back to one of these places or to an other we don't know about.
---
The scary part is that most GW2 players seem to see farming gold to buy gemstore skins as content. It's like they are waiting for the next outfit or mount skin to be released and get it.
---
Norn female is the best option in the entire game imo. Heavy armor looks really good on them, plus that heavy t3 cultural is dope.
---
there should be no difference, because amazon does not have a way to activate gw2 accounts through them self
---
- Roll the dices

- Take a card

Sailor JupiCHARR's expression is mutual... there are no words in the English dictionary that can describe how I feel about this picture's existence.
---
Human female meta.
---
I wouldn't mind more open world content if they were more like Tequatl or Dragonfall and the meta gave a chance to drop semi-unique ascended weapons like the Sunless and Scion weapons.
---
AhHhhAaahH  
---
Champion of the Sun!
---
But there is no Ettin combat tonic. There *is* an Ettin tonic, but you aren't able to use your normal weapons then. Normally...
---
You don't know how exchange ratios work. Increasing the amount of gold players can get per hour won't make it easier for you to trade it for more gems because it will devalue gold and you will need more of it buy the same amount of gems. 
---
The only thing that is gonna make your gold worth more gems are more $$$ spent in gems and then traded for gold.
---
The Furries.... they're coming. Hide your charr, hide yo mounts.

Living world season 5 will be the last content before guild wars 3.

This site is awesome. Works great on mobile holy shit.
---
ArenaNet told Teapot that they would support the tournament if he didn't use the third party tool. He turned them down because he valued the production quality over increased rewards. Get your information right before you shitpost.
---
Again, Balth said he'd spare Rytlock out of kindness. Alghazar was evil, but he was a pragmatic evil - the ends justify the means. So yea, he'd make his forged army, but if someone earned his favor well enough he'd at least temporarily spare them. We saw that for a fact. There's no reason to doubt that Balthazar might have spared Joko for a *reason*. We just don't know for sure what that reason is.
---
Not every bit of story has to be spoon fed to you. In fact, having some mysteries is recommended in writing because it makes it more memorable. No author/writer is going to answer literally every little thing. You're going to have to live with the fact Balthazar died before we learned everything about him and his actions, and that's fine. He was a God. His motivations, his desires, his abilities - they're beyond us, by nature.
---
# OK but what do you mean by "hosting an instance of the event"?
---
Good question, me!
---
While anyone can volunteer to assist with the event, one of the things we do is we create an event plan, which kind of works like an "event package", as it were. It includes the events (with rules &amp; tips for organisers, useful copy-paste messages, etc.), the schedule, prizes to send out, etc. This event plan is scalable so it can either happen on one instance, or on multiple instances at the same time - all it needs is more organisers / volunteers to do it on multiple instances at the same time!
---
A host is therefore a guild or community who wants to organise an instance of the event. We use "host" rather than "organiser" to avoid confusion between hosts &amp; volunteers - a volunteer is any individual who wishes to help out with the event.
---
These are our (flexible) guidelines for a host guild / community:
---
* Comfortable using a voice platform (Teamspeak or Discord)
---
   * The host can either use their own voice platform or the GGB Discord / OpenCommunity Teamspeak / \[SoL\] Teamspeak
---
* About 5 prospective volunteers
---
   * Individual volunteers who aren't affiliated with a host will always sign up to help, but a good base is always nice
---
* Approx 25 or more active members of their community that would be interested in attending the event
---
   * This is not volunteering, just rather a base of people who would actually attend the event
---
Every host will get shouted out on our social media, and will be listed on the GGB website under a special category for the event. As someone who originally got involved as a host, it's really fun, amazing and rewarding work! Nowadays it's pretty much the only thing me &amp; my community get excited for in GW2 ^((shade)) :P
---
So you've hit upon a good point, even though your proposed solutions, including the title of this thread, are not good.  To address the title first: simply increasing the gold earned won't do anything long-term, because of the way the GW2 economy is structured; as many others in this thread have noted, it will simply result in inflation, where the time to reward ratio is the same, but the numbers involved are bigger.  There's certainly some argument to be made that we could use more *varied* gold farms, but even then, we already have Silverwastes, Dragonfall, Daily Fractals, weekly raids, weekly key-farms, daily meta-event, and limited festival farms, so I'm not sure what else can be added.
---
The real issue IMO is something that's dogged the game for most of its life: we have a game that's built around a primarily cosmetic progression system, rather than a power-based progression system, but where the cash shop is mostly cosmetic as well.  While I certainly prefer the current gem store over a hypothetical p2w store, it still frequently clashes with the design of the game, in a way that I find frequently unsatisfying. I mean, you can spend hours on hours grinding for a given in-game reward that comes with a fancy new skin, but then you go to LA to show it off, and some level 30 dude is there outshining you, rocking skins with less clipping, better textures, and fancy effects, that they got in two minutes of typing in their credit card?  There's certainly something to be said for being content simply in a job well done, but like, there's lots of other games I can play that can give me a similar satisfaction, but that *also* give me something really tangible and worthwhile to show off, and why can't GW2 do the same.
---
Yes, you can convert gems to gold, but simply farming gold to convert to gems just...isn't appealing, IMO. The game at times just feels like an excellent demonstration of the idea that you can't have your cake and eat it too: if you're a fashion warrior or collector, the act of chasing after specific skins is often deeply unsatisfying, because it often just boils down to raw gold acquisition.  There's a handful of skins that buck this trend, but they're decidedly in the minority.  If you're more of high-end gameplay person, then things fare a little better, as you simply play the content you prefer and then hey, wouldn't you know it, you happened to collect enough gold to buy a neat thing, way to go you!  But even this isn't great, as has been discussed ad-nauseum lately, because there's minimal mechanical progression to be found, and Anet releases high-end repeatable content at a glacial pace, so once you complete something for the first time, you're just stuck repeating it over, and over, and things don't really change with each attempt. 
---
**tl;dr** the issue isn't that we don't earn enough gold, the issue is that earning rewards is often simply an unsatisfying process, either because the reward itself is lackluster, or the activity to get the reward is not fun.  This issue is foundational, and I'm not sure what ArenaNet can do at this point to fix it.
---
I really like actually that we have both "threats" and villains. By threats i mean the dragons.
---
Apart from the 60+ parts of personal story, i think GW2's story is pretty good, especially compared to an MMORPG.
---
Joko is top tier. Kralk was intimidating. Balthazar in S3 was cool. Liked the White Mantle n Beetlestone. 
---
Not really a fan of Mordremoth apart from the Sylvari connection, and Primordius is straight up boring along with Zhaitan.
---
Oh! No, it definitely doesn't do that, sorry! That sounds like some legendary tier effect. The backpiece always looks like in the screenshots regardless of your weapon skin.
---
And how's increasing the gold supply supposed to help with the exchange ratio? If anything gems will be worth more gold due to its increased supply.
---
Best GW fanart ever
---
Yes, if _only_ the technology existed for us to have a similar site for GW2.
---
Roll the dice, draw a card, and offer a number of praises to Joko in thanks for the topic on the card as indicated on the dice.
---
We still can't watch fights, can we?
---
And also cosmetic auras. That's another thing the Starborn Outfit does better than the Celestial Infusion; you can see the Starborn Outfit in character select, but not the Celestial Infusion effect.
---
Tldr?
---
The meta in Bitterfrost can actually fail, if the champions summoned aren't wiped out in time before all the torches are extinguished.  If the meta fails like that, the meta description at the right should say something different, and there won't be any chests available until the meta happens again and succeeds.
---
im expecting TEARS on forum,when aquatic will go live in T4 with some good affixes,its such shit,combined with aoe stun every  10 sec,boss have 3x more hp at least and ofc fight is stoped 2x to kill some trash......
---
Have 5 of those.
---
Crafting weapons and armor came much, much later than rings and fractals. We got rings first (and it was part of the play to progress mechanic), backpacks second (still fractals-only), then amulets (with introduction of laurels) and accessories (with introduction of guild missions) ... forward a few months for either armor or weapons (don't remember) and quite some more waiting for the other ones.
---
I'm so scared of this. Maybe because we know for a fact that Jormag is a dragon with a psycho personality, very manipulative and shit. I'm pretty sure he'll pit people against each other and almost destroy everyone without lifting a finger.
---
The people who made GW2 PvP what it was have quit the company 6 years go.
---
They became a carebear company since then. You are naive if you think a GW3 would have a PvP letalone a good one.
---
What does WoW have to do anything with it?
---
I'm so excited! I'm wondering if the male is Jormag, and the female voice is the 'mother' spoken by Kralk at the end of LS4.
---
I snorted loudly
---
Should have been for everyone in the squad, would make a good encourgement for people to join the squads instead of just running besides the squad without joining them.
---
No point is moot, you're just not part of the people I'm talking about :)
---
Asura females get the dress like the ones pictured above, however it seems charr females get the male version.
---
You pick up the figures and smash them together while saying “PSSSHHH!” “Pew! Pew!” and “AAARRGGGHH!!!”
---
A lot of the NPC'keep the viciousness of GW1 chart, it's just that a lot of players don't play them like that.
---
Yeah, actually, doing it real good.

---
30 second teaser and 44 minute and 30 seconds of MO doing card tricks
---
Hi, thank you for the reply. Does the PvP in this game work like Rock Paper Scissors, where certain classes counter and are countered by others? Or are classss all “equal” in the sense that there’s no class counter, only skill level of players?
---
Your CPU is definitely the bottleneck here for GW2.
---
Probably simpler and better to hire Matt directly for that
---
Explain.
---
it was much easier to play the game to get gem store unlocks back then. Most people weren't focused on that part of the game and the exchange rate was favorable. I got a large number of account upgrade unlocks for extremely reasonable prices back then. I didn't even need to farm, just play the game and turn all your passive income into gems.
---
They really should have better one-time account boost packages. Provide a handful of bank tabs and character slots for a reasonable price that players can buy if they don't already have a bunch of tabs/slots. All the current packages are full of black lion keys and dyes, so while on paper they are good value, they aren't really giving you what you would want.
---
How are my arguments wrong?
---
Yes! [Here is the back, for anyone that hasn't seen](https://i.imgur.com/91t5iEO.jpg)
---
Yeah, I'm stuck with that old chipset for now unfortunately. I'm planning on building a new rig in the next year, but I was hoping to work with what I've got until then. Would you say my GPU is a non-factor at present?
---
Thanks. There is better art out there.
---
That's a good guess, but nope, disabled using the executable and then manually in the registry, still the same issue.
---
Looks like i messed up with \[Time Rift\] :D
---
You're talking about a gw2 launch period faction that hasn't really been touched on since launch. We never got a clear idea of Zhaitan, Mordremoth came out as they "father" of sylvari, and we we've got Kralkatorrik's bloodline with him, his mother, his daughter, and grand daughter. Anet might not have had ideas about dragon genders back when they were mindless magic eating machines.
---
But I do think its possible for Jormag to withhold that info probably because its not important and the Svanir don't care and only want power.
---
I love this!
---
Thanks for your hard work on this.
---
Thanks for your work!

Not really. A 3770 is not stellar, even if fairly overclockable, but a 7850 is REALLY far down. Unless he's in huge cities, if he's playing with high graphic settings, he'll be more GPU bound.

Why is that? And how much would you spend in this temporary upgrade?

This goes far beyond a recolor though, as I stated. Twilight is also fairly generic when it comes to fantasy swords, so ehhhh.
---
Huh, strange, i'll ping /u/Alrai_Luxx/ as he have same CPU, maybe he have a good idea on what is goin on.
---
The most efficient method for buying stuff off the gem store is to work a job and spend part of your wages or salary on gems. Either that or buy and sell on the trading post. I finally have enough capital to make the TP my main gold source and I only bother doing meta events if I enjoy them independent of the rewards. I do Tangled Depths' Chak Gerent meta because I have fun speed-clearing it. I don't even bother selecting from the chest and selling the gemstones. Gold is plentiful enough.
---

How is this sarcastic? Isn't everything stated in the previous comment the reality though?

No, they're not untouched. One of the new suspicious traveler litteraly say "give yourself to him" and he was added yesterday.

It'd be nice to have the female version edited to fit their bodies. The times ANet caved to give them "dresses" they always look horrible because of the severe stretching at the legs.

I want to come back and play GW2 again but I’m reading a lot of recent posts and I feel like it would be a total waste for me to invest any time or money into the game at this point. Due to life, I stopped playing around HOT release and really wanted to scratch the pvp and WvW itch but it doesn’t seem like it’s worth it
---
Festival Tokens can from the current festival.
---
You can redeem Volatile Magic along with gold to get Trophy Shipments from LS4 vendors, which have a high return rate of T6 mats.  LS4 currencies that you have in excess can be consumed for Volatile Magic in order to buy more Trophy Shipments.
---
I feel sorry for you.
---
I definitely think human-scale villains are important to tell some grounded stories. Not everything needs to be a dragon fight.
---
Your GPU decides that there is not enough load to pull clocks up.
---
That is dx12 issue, only solution is force OC or background app that do same(any GPU using thing), but i don't include it in d912pxy for now.
---
You can read on this issue: [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/issues/136](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/issues/136)
---
But that could be them assuming its "he/him" the Svanir could easily have just assumed Jormag was male considering they are all about power and Svanir himself was the brother while Jora was the sister and Svanir was chosen to be given a stronger bear form while Jora was cursed and lost her bear form. So they misogynistic and think males are more powerful and so they assume the ultimate spirit is male like Svanir was.
---
Yeah this is the most likely. They might sell it as “now maps have more events, we added two collection events in each new map!!!”
---
I can just hear Braham laughing his ass off.
---
Except that "invulnerability" means nothing if it can be stolen/ate. Like, by a dragon. Balthazar wouldn't actually gain anything other than keeping mortals from killing him, and he arrogantly proclaims that, as the God of WAR, that wouldn't happen. Ever. In Balthazar's mind, he didn't need Joko's Lich powers. In fact, in comparison to Balthazar himself and the Elder Dragons, Joko's magic was probably pretty miniscule tbh. So he probably didn't even think he'd miss the raw power itself in his fight against Cracklejack.
---
When was the last large update for pvp? Like 2 years ago? 3? Anet may not have Gw on life support but pvp is. WvW is getting there.
---
All I play is WvW and do the new areas when they open.  And mine everything I see plus run my home instance ever day and anyone else’s home instance (that actually has a good amount of resource nodes).  Salvage everything I can (expanded banks is almost full) and sell everything that won’t fit in my bank (included the normal inventory slots, use that for items that I think will increase as new expansions/recipes released.
---
If you are unwilling, or unable, to formulate your disagreements in relation to my arguments, while instead confining yourself to simple mocking, why do you even bother dude?
---
was running a HD 7950 until recently and upgraded to a simple 1060. CPU is a pretty damn old pre-ryzen 8 core. my FPS tripled in empty places, and more than doubled in busy ones.
---
while ultimately your CPU will end up being a bottleneck, those old cards are surprisingly hard at work when running gw2. bottom line: it likely won't hurt anything but your wallet, and since you're building a new PC next year anyway, it might be worth getting some of the benefits already.
---
The Claw are a group though, correct, not just one individual dragon? So it's possible that we could fight one that we hadn't fought before. But there's no reason that we couldn't have a meta where we fight multiple members of the Claw at the same time, and even better if one happens to be a wingless nod to our old pal from Frostgorge!

I would love a proper photo booth feature ( on the home screen or not) where you can choose to show/hide helmet , weapons and auras, choose a pose for your character and a background for your photograph.

* This mod isn't perfect and also has a few downsides. ArenaNet would have standards for such an upgrade.
---
* ArenaNet would have to pay someone quite a bit to spend a lot of time of this, and their employees/funds are limited. They may not consider it worth it.

If your goal is to look retarded it's working

Well to me you look like cancer to the eyes, but hey if your happy good for you.
---
All good comments. Would like to see a little love shown to the select screen. It probably wouldn't take long at all to implement.
---
Playable Kodan confirmed.
---
Thanks for the hard work on the markers.
---
I was wondering what advantages there were to using this over the "official" taco? Is it just the addition of your markers?
---
Thanks again, I'm quite new to the game and have loads of achievements I'd like to finish off so I'm sure it will be a big help.

I'll note that a particular streamer decided to reply to my comment on stream. Similar to how saying don't brigade, but then going on the offensive, causes the behaviour but with a nice dose of plausible deniability, I'm now getting messages I couldn't say I was expecting. Or wanting.
---
I was going to message this to the streamer directly but in the interest of clarity and the fact that I'd like to have something to point back to, I'll put it here;
---
These were things that occurred while the streams were in motion and were just left to slide - I distinctly recall someone you were partied with in WvW using antisemtic language to refer to opponents and similar incidences happened around the ARP (though with different epithets). I do understand it is easy to miss things in text and I wish to make it clear that I don't attribute these actions to you, rather some of your fans who are spurred on by things such as call outs of people that don't have the same avenue to defend themselves, nor a willing support base. 
---
My apologies if the happenings I mentioned were deemed minor or not worth calling out but they were major reasons why I stopped following the stream and following on Twitter. The atmosphere became poor and the feeding on drama for content became tiresome. Then again, one viewer amongst many isn't worth much.
---
Anybody have some benchmarks comparing this to older versions?
---
And as always, thank you so much for all your hard work!
---
The video you linked literally has "Day version" on its title. Did you try looking for the "[Night version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZJgL7PNi50)" one?
---
Use credit card. Buy what you need. Ain't no fastest way, especially for newbies in the game.
---
oh right, well i feel like a dumbass now, thanks
---
The video you linked says "Day Version", this mount has a "Night Version" too which is this skull transformation, it's a halloween mount, spooky.
---
2ish years ago was around the release of Path of Fire which included something to eat a huge chunk of gold resulting in that rate.
---
Prior to that was around ~116 to 120g for 400
---
Increasing gold supply only makes it cheaper to buy gold with gems.
---
For the opposite they would need to add in things many people want but only purchasable with large quantities of gold.
---
Mufasa?
---
The guy in the middle is smiling internally. Charr in far right is probably planning a murder.
---
Sorry I do not know. Never watched the anime.
---
Could be worse ...
---
If we go just by the numbers, it represents it less than GW2E
---
I like. 
---
Looks quite similar to my Charr ranger:)
---
It's so beautiful! I always love full-length skirts that actually, y'know, have a front panel. The detailwork is gorgeous, too!
---
I'd love to have a more bell-shaped ballgown someday (like the Masquerade skirt but with a front panel), but I love this dress too &lt;3
---
If you WvW at all, you could play a staff healbot and camp water.
---
Sub is probably a decent representation of the community.
---
You got your open world casuals, PvP guys, roleplayers, WvW jocks, pathetic trolls, cool trolls, unfriendly LMGTFY people, know-it-all's, those who don’t know anything, desperate wannabes, burnouts, sexually repressed furries, the greatest people you will ever meet and the worst: beware of toxic elitists…

https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/caom4e/printed_my_own_evil_book_the_binding_of_ipos_as_a/ Kiza already made it! :)
---
It says to do a clean installation, but how can I uninstall the previous version??
---
Since you seem to have pretty deep acces to the renderer with this, how hard would it be to implement some kind of gw2hook yourself ?
---
Only thing keeping me from using this is the ui skip and bloom remover that gw2hook offers.
---
Yet another wonderful work, I love the snek!
---
Guilds have been running closed for years and years. Before squads/squad markers they'd put a target on the driver. They're not the reason the game mode is losing players nor would them running open save the game mode. The only reason guild groups have for running open is to 1: Recruit, and 2: Because they keep getting wiped by larger forces and are fed up with getting blobbed down. Both are pretty rare. Nothing else is going to convince them to run open. In fact, I hate rewards in this game, it's such a waste of time clearing my inventory, if I could opt out of all rewards I would.
---
I bet this outfit goes fantastically with the new competitive weapon set! The detailing is super similar.

oh yay more eye cancer
---
Hello Reddit! First post here, and I was told this might be appreciated here. I had to delete the first thread because I wanted to edit the title &gt;.&lt;
---
This is a commission of my Charr Engineer - meet Gron!
---
Painted by the wonderful ArtKitt: https://twitter.com/ArtKittweetz
---
I know Anet is kind of slow to change. Just look at how long we had buttcapes and giant shoulder pads before they started to mix things up a bit. 
---
Yet the Human Female Meta is the one thing I am glad has stayed on top and largely unchanged. Then again I'm biased as 20 out of my 26+ characters are human females. I don't even care what others might think that as a grown man my hobby is playing dress-up with digital Barbie/Victoria Secret dolls. 
---
 
---
Recently though I started to branch out and now have an Asura (Hola Tinys!), and a total of 2 Salads, and 3 Cats. Charr and Salads have some awesome customization options. 
---
One thing I found interesting is how certain outfits that just look dreadful on humans tend to look really good on some of the other races like the Salads or Charr at least as long as you go skinny. That one Ironclad outfit, for example, makes any race look like they are in some giant mech suit if you have anything then a skinny body. 'Tiny' has perfected making Asura in general, look amazing and beautiful something that I still aspire to learn how to do, and every WvW Charr commander always looks bad ass to me.
---
Still, I do agree that it would be nice if there were more variation for other races and that in some cases they didn't use the male version for the females when designing outfits for other races. There also needs to be a suit or a pair of pants for females as well. 
---
But for what it's worth thank you Anet for finally moving away from the Buttcape and giant shoulder pads meta! My other little dream which is towards the bottom of all the things I wish Anet would correct but still on the list is the hope that one day they will redesign that monstrosity that is the Promenade outfit dress.
---
Who would have thought that making big ass maps with a spatially tiny meta would lead to those maps being dead
---
infusion blob is real
---
I do like these kinds of headkanons, but do you have any basis for this:
---
&gt; The equal footing was only after Wolf, Raven, and Snow Leopard, led the norn south during the norn exodus.
---
Because I do not know of any source supporting this. The fact that bear was more prominent in gw1, does not necessarily mean that the current narrative position is that it was more prominent at that time. EotN focused more on the bear form, but this can be explained in a multitude of ways without making bear superior.
---
He already has. D912pxy has custom shader support.
---
HOWEVER! It is much more difficult to use.
---
If Reshade shaders are like making a Word document using Microsoft Word, D912pxy custom shaders are like making a Word document using nothing except a magnetized needle and a steady hand directly on the hard drive.
---
So far, the only known use of D912pxy custom shaders is for fixing graphics bugs.
---
Great news for rpers who use the hovering icons to represent NPCs. People would bump into us then 9/10 grief and bring more to us to spam spells and pull mobs to us.
---
Ew
---
This event was so fun to play at!
---
During the two months leading up to the event everyone was tabbing new songs, practicing them, and the guild in general was just more active!
---
This year we had way more people playing than the past years as well, which felt great. More people dared to play in front of an audience, which can be really daunting. I'm proud of everyone!

---
&gt; so my question is, if you can do this, why cant ANet?
---
because it is easier to take an existing infrastructure and translating it into what you want instead of having to build this infrastructure in the first place.
---
And you really would want that ArenaNet does this right from the ground up and not just do this "dirty" to prevent certain things that might go wrong like crashes or other things.
---
Wow, just... wow.
---
Smooth 60FPS in HoM, I thought I'd never be able to see that.
---
GPU usage never goes above 3%, not sure if intended but holy (GTX 1080)  
---
Finally the game can utilize more of my i7 6700...
---
Much appreciation for your work dude. Holy shit.
---
Alliances, bois!
---
i returned to the game a month before esports pulled out of gw2, the biggest problem i heard was that the balance team couldnt get it right, there'd always be one class that was OP and the rest were bland
---
All the ~~stress~~, preparations and practicing songs together in bands really took me back to my childhood, lol. But taking the stage was also gratifying in the same way. 
---
I really hope the GW2 music community keeps thriving for many more years. Pretty big part of my life at this point.
---
I need to ask, the fractal thing is also part of the joke, right? it's what made me laugh the most, funnily enough xD
---
There was shitload new maps and storry added.
---
But you need to buy new expansions. Sorry, but there really is nothing for you to do if you don't.
---
Changes take time. The fact that there is attention on this is something to be appreciative of.
---
Too often I see folks here just complain about no changes or no attention to a particular gamemode(s), but when some attention is given to it, it’s never enough.
---
I don’t disagree in saying there needs to be more done about WvW to give it some life again, but blatantly berating the additions by calling them “naive” just shows naivety on your part.
---
[Trophy shipments](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trophy_Shipment) are fantastic. There's also the [Magic-Warped Bundle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic-Warped_Bundle) for unbound magic.

But Turkey's point is you can turn that shit gold into something you want. So you prefer praying to RNGesus?
---
Is that a Dwayna colour scheme I see? 👀
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Weapon_swap
---
&gt;elementalists do so by switching between attunements
---
&gt;Switching to a bundle will also trigger on-swap effects.
---
As someone who has been suspended for "abuse of the lfg tool," I can say it is a distinct possibility. Anet is not consistent on such things, though.
---
&gt;Awesome pic though. Where's yours, huh? ;-P

The toxic elitists are confirmed to leave GW2 for WoW vanilla at least for 6 months.
---
Well it's been years since I've played, I remember there being a map wide progressing cycle on HoT maps, but people need to contribute event completion to progress if I remember this correctly? I remember there being commanders running around on HoT maps all the time progressing these events, but I haven't seen any these past few days I've been playing again. I'm not sure what else I can do other than joining the maps?
---
The real Rytlock never actually returned from the Mists portal he jumped into way back in LS2 and the Uncle Trombone we've been interacting with is actually some kind of mist wraith copy... The real Cuddles is finally in a position to make a cry audible to us on Tyria, but the Mists also produced a Rytlette wraith who is trying to do the same.
---
Oof. Someone in the art department is ripping off someone else's work.
---
Boots put out an interesting scrapper build in pvp on his YouTube channel series "Boot's Bad Builds." It's a juggernaut flamethrower build using alchemy traitline to proc a ridiculous amount of boons of every type and synergized with compounding chemicals, impact savant, and iron blood, creating a sustain condition that rivals adrenal health warriors.  The farming community has made different variants of this build running common power or condi builds.  My favorite is the on-kill zerker build since it synergizes well with vamp runes for infinite sustain in heavy target farming.
---
Probably a combo.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cosmetic_aura#Upgrade_components
---
It does well enough for open world. [Using this build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PeQAIlZwaYQMOWJO2KvteA-zRIYRUwXGRUAVkA2OA-e), I can clock around 10-11k dps in solo open world, which is about average for most builds. On your own, learn to maintain Superspeed with combos, such as
---
* Thunderclap + Rocket Charge
---
* Big Ol' Bomb + Spare Capacitor
---
* Blast Gyro (combos off itself)
---
* Fire Bomb + Supply Crate
---
Hello Reddit! First post here, and I was told this might be appreciated here. I had to delete the first 2 threads because I wanted to edit the title &gt;.&lt;
---
I actually aready have two Guardians - Female Sylvari and Female Norn and I do prefer the design of Sylvari, because she has obsidian skin with white hair and light blue attire that matches the whole theme of Guardian skills... and she obviously glows in the night in the same colour. She's actually far more interesting in terms of her appearance than my Female Norn, who's basically all-permafrost and celestial.
---
She would be indeed exotic option for this profession, but I was struggling a bit to imagine her in the next Season and Expansion.
---
I also do prefer animations and voice of Female Sylvari, which makes the decision harder for me... But then, I've mained a Sylvari character long enough and thought about giving something else a chance.
---
That's not average even for solo builds, things like cWeaver, pChrono and cFb clock way higher than that even solo open world. You have terribly low standards
---
Not intentionally but yes haha
---
Well, you ever noticed how Jormags most corrupt minions are actually brain dead?
---
Yeah, they very well may not really know. They also think that Jormag is the greatest of the Spirits of the Wild when in fact Jormag isnt even a spirit. So their way of viewing this all powerful entity is skewed and it isnt impossible at all that Jormag could very well be not what initially meets the eye.
---
Hell, Jormag could very well be TWO entities in one body. Ever think that was possible? Lyssa is known as ONE entity, right? Yet lore and some humans speculate that Lyssa may very well be two entities. 
---
Its all in the eye of the beholder and what people WANT to see. Sons sense Jormags power and to them Jormag can very well be male because Jormags champion created the very first Norn corruption. Svanir. Who was male. They can just as easily associate one to the other and automatically make the assumption due to the fact that they dont like women because of Joras actions so viewing Jormag female is inconcievable to them until proven otherwise.
---
Whos to say they even hear Jormag the way we can hear it? Much like Mordremoth affects Sylvari in a different way than any other race.
---
I like the idea of Jormag being two beings in one body. Its not that farfetched considering what happened to Kralkatorrik.
---
Shiva only has two arms
---
Some other douche on youtube.

Who is MightyTeabowl? This isn't a funny meemee or a drawing of your playable character. Please get this toxic elitism out of my community :-)
---
so what would one need to do to get the STLs for to make this and the binding of ipos?
---
First, yes I have terribly low standards for solo open world builds. Would be silly if i gave two shakes if one can pull 20k or 10k. 
---
Secondly, I wonder what your definition of average entails.
---
that’s a weird question lmao
---

---
Nice, I remember when token didnt go into wallet, and having 320 slot of stack of CoF dungeon when it was p1 spamfarm with omnom, rune with bonus gold and such, still 200k, that's dedication :D
---
Not a whole lot.
---
Quantity of raid LFGs doesn't mean much without looking into how often they are filled. If NA LFGs are filled quicker than EUs it would make sense that there would be fewer up at a glance.
---
He cant even quit like a man and keeps whining.
---
You can level however you want. As you may have observed nearly everything gives you a level. Hearts are just a **suggestion**. Orange Events actually give the most XP.  (Also Events link together on success. Stick around the NCPs and see what they do afterwards.)
---
If you go to areas with higher than your current level monsters will be difficult but it's still doable. You will need better gears, use your skills more efficienty, or even play smarter. Like do non-combat stuff for hearts e.g. revive players or F at inter-actables.
---
Also note that if you go to area's lower than your level you will get rewards for your *current* level. There is nothing in this game that doesn't reward you stuff you can't use.

Not sure, maybe one of those toxic streamers, probably funded by Russia. I wouldn't know as I only do open world, and press 1 to kill things.
---
*Who?*
---
Okay, how come I didn't get that as an outfit!?!
---
It's not decent anywhere outside maybe PvP for hyper aggresive builds, that's a maybe though.
---
Just another cringe Youtuber.
---
cause this is the definition of a band-aid. 3rd party tool makers can cut many corners game developers cant.
---
There was a Flamethrower Scrapper build that was really easy-going and chill, but pretty much every condi build was destroyed by shields relying only on power damage. Having said that, [THIS](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?PeiAoqlZwEZhsOWKWyW1tPA-zRJYsRTfYkUAVJg9qwTA-e) is my current adaptation (yes, those are Grieving stats). It is still hurting, and isn't the greatest build, but I'm having fun with it. Funny enough, my character's damage did go up. That, and flamethrower is still the king at tagging mobs.  
---
As for hammer power damage: I tried it, and I though it was ok-ish. It generally ignores all tiny chips of damage, but the -300 vit hurts a lot when facing big damage spikes. Also, not going full damage was tough because of the vitality penalty. But you can totally have fun with it and pretty much do all open world stuff with it.
---
But the gemstore vs ingame skin quality is down to personal preference... /s
---
Someone once argued back to me saying "my characters skins are worth about 5 gold and i love it (more than gemstore skins)"...fuck off
---
Very very strong in solo PvE, average in PvP, an amazing healer in WvW.
---
I agree with some of the points PvP and WvW needs major focus. 2. Anet need to communicate more but this is a two way point the community needs to learn the difference be iron clad promises and what Anet hopes to do. 3. The ingame community is the best in any MMO ever the reddit and forum community oh god well they've decided to bitch and moan while there are some good decent people on the reddit too. 4. As for the cash shop is purely cosmetic I never buy anything off it so I have no problem with it.
---
I remember the first ERP peaking at more viewers than the ESL GW2 PvP Finals lol.
---
The million dollar, Anet sponsored, PvP tournament had *less* viewrs than "Teapots shitty event that no one cares about".
---
Why do ppl post gw2 related stuff in the gw2 subreddit. Hmmmm. Actually a hard question imo.

No srsly dude this sub kinda exists for everything gw2 related. Starting from „I love this game its so great“ until „Why gw2 sucks and you should not play it“.

Whats the difference between downloading this and the one by BoyC?
---
I like Dragonfall. It's especially nice right now with ectos being so pricey due to the Festival of the Four Winds.
---
Another awesome thing about Dragonfall is you can do it on any level 80 character any time you want.
---
Am I missing something? I've read through the readme, and I get the impression there's supposed to be an "install.exe," correct? I've downloaded the archive and done a search of the whole package, and there isn't an .exe inside at all. Defender nor any other antivirus-adjacent program says anything about one.
---
Interestingly, I used GitHub's native package search, and there's no .exe inside the source direct from the site. I'd love to use this, but I'm confused, which is troubling considering everyone else seems to have no issues...? I'd very much appreciate some insight.
---
Keep up the good work, megai2.
---
How did the Rival 500 work out for you?
---
I use kind of a fingertip / claw grip hybrid and bought the G600 and it absolutely does not work at all for fingertip grip.
---
Was basically leaning towards the Rival 500 now because it has a neutral dead zone for your thumb to claw grip it in the center of those buttons.

Any chance this is dependent on the specific dye used?  Some dyes like Enameled Emblaze will create color gradients (like starting red, then orange, then brown) on some channels.

&gt; Make chrono great again a-net,
---
Bu-but, *That New LS5 Elite Spec That Required All These Nerfs To Chrono To Exist* ~~just like that other time with Acrobatics for Thieves~~!
---
Mesmer has been my main since I started the game almost 6 years ago, and consequently has Chrono. With each "fix" to Chrono, I was gradually losing interest in playing endgame content with it. With the latest "fix", the class finally became boring *everywhere*, including Open World. The "fix" caught me mid-crafting Vision for that extra-purple look, and I was kinda bummed - why even bother going on at this point if I don't want to switch to a different class?..
---
episodic since a full story sounds just sounds unsustainable
---
My biggest gripe with how ANet has handled the issue of Chrono balancing is the fact that the class' power has been nerfed through breaking the gameplay over actual number and stat balancing. With every passing patch, Chronomancer's skill expression has been dulled further and further to the current point where the skill cieling is so non-existant, that the difference between a veteran Chrono main and a newbie is virtually only DPS.
---
I understand the necessity of the nerfs, but things like proper Distort timing, proper Lesser SoI timing, proper split-cast CS casts, triple blinks, double Mass Invis, proper weapon swap timing were all things that made it worthwhile to actually learn, practice and main the class. While with each passing patch Chrono manages to remain meta as a boon-sharer, the actual gameplay enjoyment of the class has taken a huge hit. Chrono isn't bad and will remain part of most group comps in raids, but its BORING to play now (coming from someone who used to call himself a Chrono main), and nerfing a class power by hitting the gameplay experience is possibly one of the worst ways to ever change a class.
---
How do you even get onto a 2 vs. 2 map?  When I queue up with a friend we both end up in a 5 vs. 5 match.

Gz, that's a lot of ectos :)
---
Anet must nerf the balance team. Smush it hard.
---
I'm definitely enjoying Scrapper in PVE.  With the new Diviner's attribute you can stack up double boon duration across the board, and if you spec into the Firearms and flamethrower correctly you'll have 100% crit along with permanent 25 might and monster boon stacking / duration.  Add in all the barrier and tool skills and there's little you can't do.  Fun as hell.
---
This is sickkk, nice!

Same here but Celestial D/D Ele. So much cool shit happening on screen but I had no idea what any of it was.
---
Really love all your content guys, thanks a load for all the hard work you put into everything you do!
---
Preach, as someone who heavily invested thousands of hours into chronomancer to watch it gradually become less and less rewarding, it sucks. I hope that arena net chooses to improve the experience that the class can provide as well as provide reasonable alternatives, as it is chronomancer feels nothing like it use to  and deserves attention.
---
&gt;"nerfing a class power by hitting the gameplay experience is possibly one of the worst ways to ever change a class."
---
If anything I hope arena net takes this point to heart.
---
That's how it ends when you feed it after midnight

At least give me my Mimic and double MIs back :’(
---
my game won't start after installing the dll files on a clean gw2

obligatory can i have your stuff
---
I liked the S2 model the most. One map per half season but more access every update, new story every 2 weeks, a rich story, and the maps have great replayability.
---
Ikr :D
---
But either way after over 5 years on the server and were i play way more then i want to admit every day, i know the people on it. And we have not seen a big influx of people since they open Gandara up. So telling me that we are now full when there is no queue at all during prime like today. Or yesterday were there was a 4-6 man queue and same before that and a lot of outnumbered happening both on prime and outside. 
---
I am going to call it again. check your tools Arena Net! They are not working properly and stop closing the servers. Especially since you have links with more population then hosts have and yet those are open.
---
Wouldn't make much sense. These whispers are only around norn proclaiming they're hearing Jormag, and when reversed you can make out the whispers talking about strength, power, and survival (aka, Jormag's M.O.).
---
In addition, the Spirits aren't known for whispering to the norn.
---
Honestly, the first time I've even heard of you.
---
Love the details on both genders; I've never bought an outfit before, usually don't feel they're worth it, but this one convinced me to make an exception, first one I've seen that I could see lots of my characters using rather than only one or two.
---
Honestly, the first time I've even heard of him.
---
There's more than one Claw of Jormag in the same manner there was more than one Shatterer or risen dragon like Tequatl, yeah. Though they don't have a collective name.
---
I wouldn't expect a meta with multiple Claws, though. Would be interesting mind you, but I wouldn't expect such.
---
Can you link the making of?

My guess is about 1-2% of the entire population.

Super impressive. Do you have a dungeon group or do you mostly solo them?
---
I'd love to try this out sometime, but I think I may need to learn from a master at this.

\*gets eaten\*
---
I just want my distort and split on f5 back honnestly. Its depressing that a lot of my chrono friends have swapped over already.
---
My static has swapped over to chronos on all fights but largos, qadim1(cuz instant cc) and escort. On the rest of the fights we have firebrigade or boon thief setups. The improvement is considerable even if we arnt used to having the roles and with a tanky/hybrid heal firebrand. 
---
But im just not having as much fun on those classes as I could be. And when we tried chrono again last week it just felt worse to not have that 10 man stabby on qadim2 or super easy aegies/resistance if things go south on desmina. Just give chronos something.
---
Even the chrono onetrick that went just chrono dps when asked to dps is willingly swapping or asking to swap to other classes. I know that anet wants class diversity but this is too far.
---
Sorry if this feels like a useless rant I just feel that i play with a handicap when i swap back to my boon chrono instinctively when raiding

STL for binding of ipos: [https://gumroad.com/l/gPppS](https://gumroad.com/l/gPppS) I made it free but you can of course add &gt;0 :3
---
Model for Xuiquatl, hm, I will consider it. It comes in 4 parts and requires some more knowledge to print well.
---
Who?
---
Its worth noting that on NA only 2 servers are full and 1 very high. That shows the downturn especially considering the measurement of what is full keeps decreasing.
---
SF had an alliance move there a few weeks ago.
---
Me too.
---
Toobadgeous*
---
Not the entire video yes. I closed it after the part of Ben traveling to Aruba with casual's money.
---
If it helps I did watch his last video, I think it was posted yesterday or the day before, where he pretty much said the same as in my first comment.
---
I think you're over thinking it. People can do t4s with little to no healing.  If you really want to switch tbough lean on the side of more berserker.
---
But honestly how well your group can do the mechanics and dps will have a significantly bigger impact than your gear.
---
Exactly. The nerfs have barely touched the power of the class, it's still pretty much as strong as it's always been. The only thing they've made notable changes to is how fun the class is to play. If that's the only thing that you're willing or able to do, you might as well remove Chrono from the game.
---
They already unseated Chrono from the only boon support class when they introduced the Firebrigade. If they wanted less people to play Chrono, they should've buffed the 'brigade and/or nerfed the *numbers* for Chrono. Or even better, provide more options for quickness and alacrity (hell, even just self alacrity on something besides mesmer or rev would be nice). The only reason chronos were still so overly represented in raid groups was because people got used to them and didn't want to make new characters and learn new builds.
---
I get the idea to make elite vs. core specs have a trade-off, and I like it for the most part. They've done a decent job in most cases so far, and a great job in a few. Warrior's specs are great, core gets T3 bursts, SB loses T3 but gains full counter, and Zerker (my personal favorite) loses normal bursts in exchange for new bursts that require T3 adrenaline, but can then be used in rapid fire succession, with skills that increase how long you can do that. Necros and Reapers have different shroud skills, and Scourges have no shroud but instead sand shades and their skills. Even though DD's Swipe and Druid's reduced pet stats aren't super interesting, they at least don't usually affect how fun the class is to play. I just can't understand how the same team that came up with those (especially Berserker) could make Chrono so annoying and clunky. 
---
Maybe they should go the Rev route and add an F5 to the core class that could do something like apply or extend boons on yourself or convert a certain number of conditions into boons, and maybe Mirage (which I don't think has been touched yet) would get one that applies torment. It'd be better than removing something that was important to all three mesmer specs (shatters not requiring clones and also triggering off yourself). Heck, they could have clones run to you instead of their target before shattering if they wanted to reinforce the melee/tank idea provided by the shield.
---
I am not much for upvoting fluff or some art, but this is pretty cool!
---
You cant really have any other relationship with them. The leader has a bit of anger issues.
---
Braise Joko!
---
Yeah, ofcourse rant videos like this do not get views and generate money or just attention. Been playing this game for ages but nvm.
---
Yikes it's bikq
---
I wondered that myself. Yes that is an option. On the download page for this, the 'External Pack' is just the markers and routes etc. It just goes in the POI folder like tekkits pack.
---
I prefer playing fun content to acquire shit I want, instead of being forced to farm gold in wherever it's most profitable to compete with everyone else.
---
I agree this is probably what happened, but I still really hate it.
---
Many professions have core traits and skills that are support-oriented, but were never updated. Support was not really part of the game's design prior to HoT, but there existed all of these core profession capabilities that *are* support capabilities but were seemingly neutered out the gate.
---
When HoT came out, we got things like druid, chronomancer, and herald that are undeniably support-focused, and were undeniably far and away the most powerful supports the game had ever seen. For some reason, existing support abilities were not updated for this paradigm, and for some reason they've gone pretty much untouched.
---
There are specs you would -think- to be powerful supports. Things like elixirs/inventions (engineer), or blood magic (necromancer). But for some reason, seemingly by design, these things are never allowed to reach the same capabilities as any support specs released since HoT. And it's not just elite specs... Ventari for Revenant was introduced in HoT, is a core legend, and contains powerful support skills with powerful support traits including AoE alacrity.
---
I guess the tl;dr of this is... ArenaNet needs to make up their mind on how much support a profession should be able to provide, and apply that principle universally rather than to a select few professions. Non-revenant core support specs need to be grandfathered in as capable support specs rather than the afterthoughts that they are.
---
So normal ppl can just watch his stream? Or is there a way to participate? Cant realy find information.

Heading to WvW, a chill, but effective spec is Spell Breaker, imho. 
---
For commanding, the go-to is Firebrand, but you can lead on anything really.
---
Experience in this game scales up, such that doing content in an area that's a few levels below your own won't give you any less experience.
---
That being said, there is a multiplier, based on the level difference between you and the area you're in. But the difference will never be so substantial that you can't just stay in a low level area that you enjoy and level up.
---
&gt; Experience gained is modified by the difference in the content level and your character level. This modifier begins with a base of 50% and scales linearly as the difficulty decreases. For example, a level 50 character completing a level 25 event will receive 52500 * .07 * .75 = 2757 XP. This does mean a high level character will receive more experience for the same content as a low-level character, but the percentage of a level gained is higher for the lower level character. For example, a level 25 character completing the same event will receive 14100 * .07 = 987 XP. While this is almost one third that of the level 50 character, it is 7% towards the next level compared to the 5.25% the level 50 receives.
---
The thing that bothers me: You know that executioner's axe can be added to the wardrobe and be assigned a specific key now and it doesn't have to fill your shared inventory slot anymore?
---
Oh, that bit i knew already.
---
Loudest most obnoxious minority are the ones you hear about. Silent and content veterans who stay in the game are the majority although they may complain time to time.
---
Thanks! Although one note - Pink Day in LA is not just for breast cancer (anymore :P). It started out as a breast cancer event but the fundraiser has been for the Canadian Cancer Society's International Research Grants for a few years, meaning the cause is both general &amp; global. ^^
---
Win10 is like 5€ in Ebay
---
I only log in to collect dailies but still update d913pxy so thank you for all the effort and work you do.
---
That'll do it. Thank you!
---
How exactly does scrapper support outside gyros?, traits have zero synergy with supporting other people.
---
That's a horribly biased way of looking at things that shows that you really did only care about moaning the same tired line over and over until people gave up. I'm sorry someone that was magically immortal was weak to a magic eating dragon. It makes soooo little sense doesn't it? And I'm sorry a literal God that has shown a willingness to spare people that help him did just that, spare someone that helped him. Especially when that magical immortality you wanted him to gain would mean nothing against... Magic eating dragons.
---
Your argument makes zero fucking sense.
---
If you wanna complain about writing, complain about actual faults in the writing. Like Anet ignoring the other Pale Trees, abandoning Ascalon's ghosts, not showing us a damn thing about Cantha/Tengu/Dwarves, writing off Primordus so easily (even though we'll likely revisit him), the fact that every time we've went to Elona it was to kill a rogue God, the total irrelevance of the Deep Sea Dragon, Scarlet Briar, and more.
---
There are actual things to bitch about besides this bullshit. Like, seriously. Why is THIS the hill you want to die on when it comes to Anet's writing?
---
I will say I wish we got more Joko, he was a fun character, but his death actually made sense. It was the ONLY way to make his death make sense, in fact.
---
WvW and sPvP... wait for the August 30 announcement. If there's nothing big mentioned for those modes then you can say goodbye to competitive play in those modes.
---
Ooh! I want to hear more about the WvW build! Pretty please 😁👍
---
Maybe it's just that they only have gender they choose for themselves? I mean Aurene clearly gave the name herself, commander speaks what she communicates to them in that cutscene. It seems like there's a lot of consciousness at the egg stage of a dragon

I played PvP religiously for years on end. 
---
I am burned out. Arena Net is living in a fucking box. Who the fuck releases a new map in fucking custom arenas? Look at other games, they're doing subtle changes TO A SINGLE HUGE MAP to keep people playing. THEY ARE ADDING 5V5s, 4v4s, 3v3s, 2v2s, 1v1s, UNREAL FUCKING TOURNAMENT HAD 1V1 MAPS!
---
Why did it fail? Because even if you have a plant which really wants to live stuck in the dirt of a pot but you don't water it
---
**IT WILL DIE.**
---
Like any game sub, a decent portion of serious players. Doesn't represent the casual playerbase.
---
I went full melee with invulnerabilities and dodges and AoEs, nuked them. Then died from conditions lol.
---
With the way devs interacting with players has been going recently, it's not really a surprise barely any devs say anything anymore. I don't think it's a trend that's unique to Anet/guild wars. Devs get death threats for petty nonsense these days. Hell, I'd keep my head down too.
---
Attunement swap or conjure weapons. Also worth mentioning that for engineer they proc on kit swaps as well as photon forge for holosmith. Revenants can weapon swap normally but weapon swap effects also proc on Legend swap, necros for shroud, druid for Celestial Avatar, and Firebrand with tomes.
---
link a build?
---
oh so raids
---
Anet, plz, if you’re doing Mountain of Madness shenanigans, crank it up 120%!!
---
I’d pay for your take on some ancient horror in GW universe banging the six and then some. (Nope, Balth ain’t resting in peace)
---
&gt;5 seconds

I want to live in your reality.

As a Sailor Moon fan, this is amazing! Wish there was an outfit close to this in game. Also, Sailor Jupiter is the best. :3
---
Really shows how much we need dulfy. Sad emoji face.
---
After watch this video I feel sad that I missed the event :(
---
Having it in inventory slot let's you equip midair / it's a muscle memory thing
---
No matter what I do with Windows Defender I don't get the installer.exe, only the folder.
---
no, lol. she was gonna be corrupted if not for joko's power. she even said herself "brand in heart, hard to mend". made her basically immune to corruption. but sure jan

"This content has been temporarily disabled"

mimic should instantly copy the last used utilitie skill kinda like the ultimate from leblanc in LoL. change my mind.
---
I can. There are millions of applications, programs or hell OSes out there where people have no access to the source code, and they still use them without any complaining or paranoia...why should this mod be treated differently?
---
been out of the game for almost a year. is it still alive?
---
EDIT: The issue seems to have been resolved! Deleted the image of the issue because the gloves now look most excellent!
---
Original game is now free. You can buy both expansions, just one, or neither. Most players treat the base game as a trial at this point, as 99% of the content that they're developing is for expansion content like raids, gliders, mounts, and the living story episodes.
---
You realise they added 2v2 maps nearly a year ago right? This is just then adding another one to be used in 2v2 ATs.
