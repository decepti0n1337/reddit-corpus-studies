Can anyone confirm for me what time the PvP season 14 ends? In game it says to me 10:29 on Tuesday 8 January but has no mention whether this is server time or my local time? I recall the announcement for the season saying it ends on the 7th?
---
Wouldn't be surprised if they withheld a Lunar New Year celebration back till Cantha appears ingame.
---

---
There's plenty of festivals in DR anyway.
---
Eh? You sure about that?
---
Passed LA today and it was just as full of people as it always is. Not sure why your instance looks like that. Maybe it got empty and people did not map change. Maybe it was some off hour? But tbh i pass LA during all times of the day and night and i never felt it was empty ever. 
---
Claudia Christian rocks!!!
---
If *that* kills your immersion, just wait til you run into people with over [3k hours](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/acoqy3/in_a_nut_shell/) :'D
---
I agree with you. I have have my headphones on the table when i play my norn females. But i also think it is about personal opinion and as much as i can not stand the female norn voice without cringing hard i know just as many who think it is great. So i have just left it at that. 
---
Yes, but [the model for this mount](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f2/18/12/f2181254deaa7e7c9d24ee42c804679c.jpg) was also datamined, which would be a multipeople mount.
---
Shhh. Don‚Äôt let the time travel police find me üòÅ
---
The thing is, underwater combat is inconsequential and realistically the only time you enter water is when trying to reach the other side... So it really shouldn't handicap you to just slot the same mantras as you have on land, this stops them from resetting. 
---
FFXIV did it better.

Most likely will come back for Halloween, but you can sign up for [Gem Alerts](https://gw2timer.com/?page=Account&amp;section=Gem) at GW2Timer.com and it will let you know when it's back on the store.

you're having high expectations for a free trial

Why is it a problem if you are the one that doesn't want to use the mantras underwater?

If you are using another skill of course the others will be lost.

Ah, the awkward moan when she takes damage. It actually makes me chuckle now, but when I first started playing, I was like WTF was that...
---
if they made eotm so that you cant fall off with every other step you take (obviously exaggerated) id find it more enjoyable personally.
---
you can't actually turn gold into gems,as that is a feature only unlocked by paying for an expansion or other such thing,therefore I can't just earn gold to buy it
---
Oh i'm coming for you "boo". You throw it on "he's blinding people" because you fail to comprehend something as basic as subjective sense and therefor can't come up with a decent argument as to why you make shitty statements you somehow confuse with your irrelevant opinion. Because in reality, somewhere along the ride you've hopped onto the popular opinion bandwaggon to not fall pray to your insignificant little self worth. Forming a very own opinion is hard for you.
---
Luckily for me, many people walk around in game like shining beacons. Happy eye gouging.
---
It should end the 7th at reset (server time 00:00, PST 4PM, EST 7PM)
---
That's the idea. Pointless to introduce new weapon types if only the new elite specializations can use them.
---
If you are on a killing spree (killing enemies for heartzone etc) also kill yellow mobs. There is growing exp bonus for mobs that live long enough, and most players ignore yellow mobs. 
---
The funny thing about these pvp bots is that a lot of them are legitimately better than actual players. The bots, at the very least, can follow basic skill rotations and know how to run to a node and capture points. I'd welcome them on my team over most players. 
---
Don't think of this as "f2p" but more a trial of the game. It isn't like there is a distinction between f2p and b2p players in this game. Instead of an actual trial period, you have an infinite trial time and can decide whether you want the expansions or not. 
---
while I understand most peoples talk saying that the mail restriction is to keep scammers and such away,I also think it could have been done much better than just a blanket ban on mailing items for f2p.
---
Thank you 
---
I can't imagine someone talking like this un-ironically, but sure enough this is normal for you. Must be insufferable IRL lol. 
---
It‚Äôs actually fun. What‚Äôs insufferable is this mess of my screen! 
---
This happens pretty often with this event. I did Secret Toymaker for the first time last year and got stiffed on my gift. Even after contacting the people who run it they never responded to my emails. Overall its a fun event people like to ruin.
---
It was 420 what ya gonna do
---
Huh!  I thought you could do gold to gems as FTP.   Colour me surprised, my bad, I stand corrected.
---
This is so accurate it hurts, mainly because I keep laughing.
---
Ask for a hit, what else?
---
[removed]
---
Lol, Dingle berries always saying "HALP"
---
They told me I could be anything, so I became chaos gloves.
---
Can't trade gold for gems either, locking free players to 3 bag slots, one bank tab and 2 character slots until they can get to 5k ap wich could take a whole year for a free account.
---
Can't use guild bank or tavern among other guild services.
---
Can't whisper to players wich you aren't mutually friends with.
---
Can't link items or locations in squad chat.
---
No end game PVE involves range at all. All fights are pretty much done in melee range, to take advantage of party boons and healing.
---
If you want to play casually, all classes have ranged options. Just pick the class which appeals to you most. 
---
I'm pretty sure it's shopped.  You can't get that white of an effect with infusions.
---
Getting rid of tiers altogether would be as simple.
---
You should mention the fix if youre going to say that OP should have used it.
---
He cant just know it magically, and you clearly know. Just help him and explain it to him/let him know how to seek the info he needs. 
---
Because as it is, this comment is useless. 
---
the legendary armor collection does give you a full set (envoy I) 
---
I know :( I have the Bifrost, and I wish I would have just went for the Dreamer for my other toon... 
---
Will definitely involve blasts
---
Wait till a half off promo. I got base game, HoT and PoF for $27. Totally worth it. 
---
No reason, citizen. Nothing to worry about. Now go back to doing... whatever it is you types do. 
---
The easy fix is probably "Buy the game"
---
Like /u/NeroWrought mentioned, organised group content tends to want players to stack together to give them boons and buffs (Druid's [main might](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rejuvenating_Tides) is a small AoE around them, chronomancer [Well](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Well_of_Action) and [tides](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tides_of_Time) are also small aoes that need stacking, sprits and banners are larger aoes but still want grouping, etc). As for [specs](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) that actually have ranged options there is: [Rifle Deadeye](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/deadeye/rifle/), [Condition SoulBeast](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/condition/), [Condition Berserker](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/condition/) / [banner](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/banner/) (on longbow only), and [Condition Scourge](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/condition/) are the main ones. Most of these ranged options still want to be close to the boss and they all want to be with the group for boons.
---
Blast my fire field bro
---
Yeah, im just saying, its useless and unhelpful to just mention there being a fix unless you are going to explain it. 
---
Best rp answer!
---
That's Mordremoth shenanigans for sure.
---
Kinda sad, honestly. I don't expect most people to agree, but damn, some heavy downvoting. 
---
Generally [high tier fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds) prefer power DPS to burst the bosses and mobs down faster so scourge isn't a great pick. If you don't mind running a second set of gear [power Reaper](https://discretize.eu/builds/necromancer/power-reaper) is a good option. If you want the same gear and spec (with minor trait changes) [power Deadeye](https://discretize.eu/builds/thief/power-deadeye) uses dagger / dagger and can swap to rifle if needed (though generally not used for the previously mentioned reasons). 
---
Of the options available, transferring off the server is possibly your best. GH didn't have the number of commanders to become a host server, whilst it did have a good(ish) population size.
---
Server loyalty went out the window years ago. Transfer to somewhere else to get an enjoyable experience and don't count on alliances happening any time soon.
---
Yeah...I don't know if you'll be able to really fix that. Limiting character models, and maybe turning down post processing to reduce total effects on screen, but Istan is going to tank fps regardless
---
It‚Äôs not amazing. It is better in HoT onward. The sounds when they get knocked down are terrible. Even so, I tend to prefer Norn females for my characters. 
---
My bad I meant sword shield
---
You want consistency, right? How about consistent non-wardrobe status for all legendaries! :) 
---
I thought it could be sarcasm, but you can never really tell via plain text with no tone, so better safe than sorry mate
---
How do you burst a thief since they appear from stealth and kill you on the spot?
---
Can't wait for the v1. I tried some tools like yours. Gw2 navi, Taco and arcdps. Navi is unfortunately too heavy, it slows down my game. Taco (for me) is only usefull for SAB (and "winter berries"). And arcdps was a mistake. I feel more confortable if i don't know the party damages. I heal, so i don't need to know that. :)
---
I will try it. For the speedmeter, for the Taco compatibility, for the design, for the timers (don't forget to add Serpents Ire and Leg anomaly, i lead them :p) and for all the promises of your project. 
---
Congratulations ! So far it's awesome, amaizing and wonderfull.
---
Quick asking.
---
1) checkboxes (=to-do list) in your note pad could be usefull 
---
2) should i be worried about a third-party program which is able to look inside my computer to check other programs running ? Ref: what you say about the ability to check if Taco is already launched at the same time of your Blish hud.
---
Thanks ! :)

expanding on the idea of https://gfycat.com/SlimEdibleKingsnake , could it be used to for example sigil of fire and it would pop up the three types? 
---
I... How, I mean, no offense but I hate the French voice and I'm French speaker. They sound rubbish and like a parody
---
But maybe it's just the fact I'm bored about them anyway, surprise but glad. For them 
---
&gt; Do you agree with me or think I'm overreacting/being idiotic? 
---
You want the real answer? You're overreacting/being idiotic. The entire *point* of these restrictions is to prevent gold spammers from buying throw-away accounts. You want completely free and open communication with no restrictions/safeguards? Go play one of the thousands of MMOs that doesn't have this, and see how much 'fun' it is.
---
Buy the game. For a *very* low price, you're getting a heck of a lot of content. Additionally, with no subscription fee in their game, how else do you expect ANet to fund the game?
---
Your example about not having map chat is a shame, but it's a necessary evil. If you remove that, the maps get flooded with gold spammers. Yes, it can be frustrating, but saying it's 'excessive' is extremely narrow-minded. It's "I don't want to pay for this, and their restricting me for security concerns is mean!".
---
Make them obtainable via raids just to trigger people. 
---
Well that‚Äôs your opinion, buddy. The female norn voice is honestly one of my favourites! The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm awesome‚Äù line is really cute and adds personality to female norn imo &lt;3

Not sure at all, but "chainload" method for buildtemplates changed like... months ago or so? I mean, is not necessary to have the "chainload.dll" for loading templates .dll.

Can you try just d3d9.dll + buildtemplates.dll and see what happens?
---
Thanks for information!
---
Thats the one I use, straight from the arc website.

Get a job

You can use all kinds of summons there, they all gonna treat your opponent as normal pve mob.

 it's a shiny pokemon encounter :P
---
&gt; (as guild chat is near useless for that in my experience) 
---
Or you know, join a guild that isn't dead? I know finding a guild may not be the easiest, but saying that guild chat is useless for grouping up as an objective Truth is not really fair. 
---
/u/Dartwo also brings up a good point; champions ARE soloable. If you come across a boss that no one's fighting, there's a few options:
---
* It's a weird hour. If you're attempting Shadow Behemoth in Queensdale at 4am EST on a Monday, you're not going to get many people.
---
* It's a boss no one does anymore. Yes, these occur. The Charr Fire Shaman boss in Iron Marches is often left untouched, because it's out of the way and generally doesn't give anything amazing.
---
* You're on a dead or dying shard. Since GW2 instances are created dynamically, there's always this possibility.
---
World events in gw2 *encourage* group participation, so odds are if no one is around to fight a boss, there's a good *reason*.
---
Finally, if you're going to say "I think this could have been done better", *tell* us how! There is nothing more annoying than someone saying "Your product sucks and should have been done better!" without explaining why.
---
Ah, thought you could, but thanks!
---
i think shaterer is even closer.
---
Of course !!!
---
I walked in when i was alone in my instance... And i said to myself "It doesn't make sense"..  Thanks to you, it does make sense !!!
---
Is there a chance to apply to your guild? Ofc not just to be able to race on this track ;) (oh, sweet back intentions)
---
How many of each track part did it take to make?
---
A duel arena somewhere in lion‚Äôs arch sound like a pretty cool idea to me. Let people put money or items on the line too and it might be pretty popular. Let people spectate and place bets. Something like the duel arena in Runescape.
---
Your mistake is assuming they're still looking at the game - they alt tabbed out the second they tagged the boss. They'll alt tab back in after the fight to collect their loot. This is why you always rez the downed, but never rez the fully dead, even after a fight. *Make* them wp.
---
Try downloading the new ini too - and the other dlls 
---
Clearly not enough balls in your life
---
There's people who actually believe this.
---
Yeah but while they're alive they do the same and continue doing no damage.

Female norn sometimes says "I'm awesome!" when earning achievements.

You can mute those voice cues in the sound settings panel.

---
It's account wide so you work on the same mastery with every character, it's like leveling your account instead of a character. 
---
Why not just program the game to play itself and remove any player interaction entirely? That seems to be what you're going for.
---
perhaps accounts/characters must be over 1 year old or must have been active for a certain amount of time? just some thoughts
---
You only get the MP for the first time you complete the expansion story instances so I assume so
---
Be that as it may, I daresay all male charr voices have a husky tone to it which is what gives it that snarly effect. For example, Dinky and Clawspur from your OG warband. The ones like Maverick are less husky but for his character I think it matches his young hotshot personality.
---
Good example would be Mangonel Gearstrip whom you meet either as a norn if you picked blacked out at moot or assault Zhaitan on land in chapter 8.
---
Also curious how you picked up British accents because literally everything in the game sounds American even the Welsh-based Sylvari.
---
I legit had someone go "i thought gw2 was a nice community, guess not" while dead for like 5 minutes after spamming "rez me" every minute. 
---
This was linked here a while back and no, I personally think Gw2 should be allowed to age as much as WoW has.
---
Might I ask which aspects of this you feel are over the top?
---
To me, personally, I don't quite feel that any of these features make the game necessarily easier (unless you count the difficulty of switching between gw2 and your browser to look up stuff).  The remaining features are just quality of life improvements as far as I can imagine.  Certainly none of it automates gameplay or removes any in game challenges.
---
I did it all on one character. 
---
With the next expansion, we'd be at 3. Theoretically, that ought to be enough for each class to have a support, a condi, and a power focused elite spec. I don't know that it *needs* to be more specific than that, really, given the game system?
---
Alright thanks
---
Just double checking, but are you seeing karma icons for the orphans being shown in TacO, or are you still seeing the full trails going from orphan to orphan?  I ask because TacO comes with a marker pack for  the Wintersday event, too, that may need unchecking as well.  That is certainly strange if not, though.
---
I will say that while implementing my own support of the marker packs, I found that the Tekkit packs contain a couple of typos (it looks like some lines are copied and pasted, but duplicate attributes are missed when the lines are tailored for the marker) and maybe they could be the cause for some strange interactions when loaded by TacO.  I wrote some expressions to fix the known ones that I found so that they would work out of the box, but I'm not sure what TacO does - I imagine it likely just ignores the invalid or duplicate attributes.
---
/u/sankurix, if you see this, please check some of your marker files for "0behavior" instead of "behavior" and also check for sections with duplicate "minSize" attributes.  I plan on getting you a diff that contains the fixes that I've found  at some point in the near future, if you're interested.  :)
---
Line 189 of tw\_gatheringnodes.xml has a "0behavior," for example.  
---
 
---
I couldn't agree more. Her voice detracts from the fantasy-esque immersion GW2 typically offers. It's unfortunate they allowed this to slip through editing in the first place. "Awesome?" Really? Please. 
---
Im still waiting for Taimi mount to go official...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKsSL3S4ZQw
---
Correct. I am glad you now see how ridiculous you sounded.
---
Id suggest ranger if you have both expansions and if you dont mind playing support heal class. You can play power/condi open world. For fractals you can go druid. For raids druid or condi soulbeast(not top pick but pretty easy to play if you are playing only with shortbow - as starter build)
---
Yes!  It's not one of my immediate goals, but I do have experience with cross platform .NET development and hope to get it working on Linux as well as Mac (depending on if I can get my hands on a Mac to test and compile on) in the near future.  Some features won't work on other platforms, such as the 3D stuff (since I don't believe the Mac client exposes the Mumble API...), but something is better than nothing.
---
Are you using Wine to run it on Linux?  I'm curious to see if the Mumble API is still accessible when the game runs on Linux.
---
What? They don't sound British at all.
---
&gt;holy wow wat damn jeezus
---
On a side note, my wife saw this and thinks it's hilarious.  She won't stop saying it every few minutes to me now.  üôÉ
---
I would advise against engaging with lordkrall even with logic and facts behind what you write, it's a fruitless endeavor.
---
278 or 287? Could've sworn I've seen several 287 mastery people.
---
I only did the first part of it to unlock raptor+masteries when I hit level 80. Nothing in that very first mission is all that spoilerific. Still, I had no idea what was going on or who anyone was at all (other than Rytlock). I certainly did not know at the time !that Balthazar was actually present in LWS3, disguised as Lazarus, though when I did get to LWS3 I put two and two together, knowing that PoF is all about Balthazar returning and wreaking havoc...but even knowing what PoF is all about is hardly avoidable.!

I think the point of tiers is to break a gigantic achievement into smaller, less-intimidating pieces. "Drink one thousand drinks" is a bit more daunting to look at than ten "drink one hundred drinks".
---
And if ANET has any questions or would like to review any source code, I am more than happy to assist and provide (I know you already have plenty to deal with).  My only request is that you don't judge my unprofessional coding practices - ReSharper does that enough already (although, if you have any recommendations, I'm all ears - ha!).  üòõ
---
WeirdChamp
---
I believe that's what I did (it's been a couple weeks since I first worked on it).  I'm pretty sure I did a boost going downhill and recorded a number a bit higher than that as the max (closest multiple of 10), but I could be remembering things incorrectly.
---
That being said, it's easy enough to adjust it in the future if I find that it's not a good representation of the max speed.  :)
---
Should have brought a holo it‚Äôs way better dps than dh 
---
Can you even do fractals sub 80?
---
Plus I wouldn't have to drink ALL 1000 to get all the AP.  Having the tiers means I can still get 1 or 2 AP even if I don't do the entire achievement.
---
Advise for new players. Craft twilight and sunrise sell both weapons and take your profit. Buy eternity then unlock the skin.  In this way you get all the skins by just unlocking eternity plus tons of extra gold.

I've got a pretty shit work schedule where I end up playing around 6-11am on weekends, mon., tues., and  can play 3pm-8am wed., thurs., fri. Would I be able to join your guild? My goal is to start crafting legendary armor.
---
Yeah, yeah, I've been talking about the potential Episode 6 from March/April. Anet already said in their trailer that the new mastery would be the bond thing, so if any additional mounts get to be released, it will be in March and I'm expecting the co-driver mount.
---
Yep, that was what I have issues with as well.
---
However gotta say, she did improve alot over time, and I think her performance in HoT and PoF are much much better than the ones in Main Story.
---
I have 3000 hours but I look like I have 10 ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

GW2 norns in a nutshell. Big drunks, boastful, rash and oddly childlike. new land!? NEW LAND!!

Fair my bad, nice moderation :)

278 is the max at the moment.

Too true 
---
Can‚Äôt argue that.

Re-read the post.

CMDR: "WP if dead"
---
"lol" *proceeds to stay dead*

Id like this too, so I didnt have to see the ugly ass animations with it.

Why? Because infinite tools would be a lot less desirable if normal tools could have thousands of charges.
---
I didn't think I was getting a gift this year, which would have been two years in a row for me. The event is about giving, not receiving, so although I was disappointed I was okay with that. Then yesterday I received a mail with my gift and an apology for not being able to send it sooner.
---
Hopefully your secret toymaker contracts you soon.
---
Dh slow is irrelevant, chronos do it all already. The real reason you bring dh is for instant vuln for the splits and it‚Äôs dps is nice too 
---
Oh, I was born in the battlefield from a blood legion shaman slain by a norn mesmer.
---
The mesmer took pity of the newborn cub and took him home and raised me. She named me George Charrison, as per Norn custom. 
---
I went back to the black citadel after my childhood and became an Ash Legion member. I then joined the Order of Whispers, mentored by the great Tybalt Leftpaw himself. After Tybalt's death i took revenge on Zhaitan and came back to Hoelbrak to see my norn mother once again.
---
In her dying bead she prophethized i would claim the power of the rainbow and defeat Gorseval the Multifarious. I wield both The Bifrost and The Dreamer and i'm imbued with all eight of Gorseval's ghostly infusions as a proof she was true.
---
I also crushed Mad King Thorn and stole his Nightfury, then killed another Dragon and the human God of War (he was called Baltimore or something, i can't remember his name it was just another tuesday for me). 
---
I found my raptor partner deep in the Mists, which i explore every day. Right now im trying to decide if i should become the Ash Legion Tribune or continue my career as a guitar slinging, staff wielding daredevil. 
---
This is my story.
---
For the next couple days, it's 278.
---
They very well would have mentioned it by now. Besides the previous major patch was a balance patch.
---
Yeah, over the last ten years I've done a fair bit of work with at-risk youths, and mental health training is always a huge part of it.
---
&gt; I would like a new version of the 9 rings
---
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die
---
Which twitch stream are you watching? Would love to tune in as well
---
They only mentioned the last balance patch in an offhand comment on the forums, so I don't think we should expect anything at this point.

Those are placeholder textures for textures that aren't being properly accessed from video ram.
---
Buy advanced tools from the laurel vendor; they have 250/125/250 uses. After all, nothing in the inventory stacks beyond 250 anyway. Your alts deserve better. Give your main infinite gathering tools and give your alts laurel tools if you don't want to transfer the infinite tools.
---
When I started playing GW2 five years ago it was considered common courtesy to res players. Now people walk past you like you're a dead mob.
---
**Old Man Mode Activate**
---
Laurel vendor tools don't give glyph bonuses, thats the whole point.
---
If you're talking about legendary mount **skins**, the one off gem store skins already kind of fit this role. They use higher quality textures, have more complex designs and color mapping -the grand lion griffon skin even has [footfall effects.](https://i.imgur.com/QkAyywJ.jpg)
---
It will be one of the great mysteries of the GW2 community, though I am curious. Maybe it was a temporary throw away account to take the requests
---
They should have a setting for hide accessory glow and hide accessory combat effect. Kind of like how you go into the settings to hide your helmet in WoW. It‚Äôd just be this way until/if they ever add accessory skins. (Highly unlikely imo)
---
Mesmer or Engi.
---
These 2 classes in particular have a variety of builds accessible when considering their HoT and PoF Elite specs.
---
They have glyph slots. If you have glyphs, you can put them in the tools.
---
Any possible thoughts on putting a DPS meter/ actual enemy's health pool down the road? So then dont have to run both ArcDps and Blish at the same time 
---
in case anet nerfs chrono after seeing this, i just wanna say buffing other classes will make the game way more fun than simply nerfing one class. 
---
But here is where you are missing the whole point. WvW is bleeding veterans right now. Like really bleeding. And when this happens you would imagine that new players or more casual players who pops in from time to time would kind of take over and carry the torch. But this rarely happens. What do happen is that those players stand in spawn asking for a com to tag up and when that do not happen because the server lost to many coms they get toxic talking about dead server and then log out. 
---
So we are not at that point i suggested right now, But we are sure running there in full speed. So i understand that you have fun now. But for veterans and dedicated WvW player who is really understanding what is going on in WvW we are worried and if you wan to go on and have fun, you should be worried too instead of trying to tell us that WvW is fun and why we complain. 
---
If you play PvE a lot. And there was nothing really happening at all for years except for a few updates here and there. You must understand that what looks great now can very fast turn in to bad if the game mode don't get attention or if the game mode do not get what the veterans and the dedicated WvW players are really asking for. This should not be that hard to translate in to WvW and PvP as well. 
---
I just started this game 2 days ago, and I love thief.  I haven't even really played any others.  There's no cooldowns, just a powerbar that you need to manage.  Try thief, apparently it is not like the other classes.
---
I don't have the glyphs.  Again, literally the whole point.
---
Never play on patch day
---
Well, you might have gotten the freebie for logging in! The next cheapest are only 23g each!
---
I don't think there will be a ballance patch at the same time as there is a chapter with new map and a fractal coming out. I mean that would be too much bug fixing for it to go smoothly.

/u/ImFreeSnow  Since it's not quite released yet.  I was thinking, what about a Trading Post section that you can put items in a watch list and alert you when that item is at a desired price?  It would use only the API to keep track of item value and not be linked to the game in anyway.
---
You can, and you actually get upscaled to level 80 for them.  Of course, you can't equip any Agony Resistance so you can only go so high.
---
So the existing build templates addons UI is no where near as good as this....  
---
Is there any chance that you could make a way to load the build templates in the arc dps meter look better?   
---
it is a huge ask but that would let us have real build templates
---
Just like episode 3s ending wasnt spoiled within a day of it releasing. Sure.
---
because red= bad guy
---
You can still find them at wayfarat on tumblr :3
---
&gt;Also, who in the hell did they get to write dialogue for heroic adventures, set in a mythic land that occasionally shout: "I'm awesome!"
---
Almost every single character in the game has dialogue like this. It's not meant to be the typical medieval fantasy game where every character talks like they're narrating a story book where over 80% of them have a British-like accent. It's different and it's great.
---
Level a crafting skill (such as Weaponsmithing) to 500 and you can use those in tandem with a couple of other easy materials to create Lumps of Mithrillium (craftable once per day) which sell for several gold each. Takes 50 Mithril Ingots to craft 1 so it'll be a nice sink while also obtaining a nice chunk of money consistently. 
---
Not really, besides the scaling.  
---
They are a lot more focused on the mechanics compared to GRs. They are also mostly for gold, until you start doing high tier fractals daily and then you actually start to rack up the ascended gear drops and fractal relics. by then you already have BiS gear to even be able to do those fractals.  
---
The best way to gear a fresh 80 is to buy exotics off the tp. Exotics(orange) are second best gear class and good enough for everything but high tier fractals.
---
Is this a pointillism style or is that from the canvas texture?
---
Depends on what you mean by thief. Core, daredevil, deadeye are all viable but hugely different specs. Both holo and rev have access to reveal which stops them from entering stealth, this is very useful vs deadeye and daredevil. All 3 have shitton of evades but are faily squishy once they got hit. To be honest, you can't kill a thief unless a thief overextends and plays carelessly.
---
The best thief counter is another thief, or something that can do burst and has instant teleports like a guardian.

There are only 84 mount skins and 81 outfits total. The rest of the cosmetics are skins that change the look of individual equipment pieces (helmet, shoulders, chest, gloves, leggings, boots, weapons, back item), many of which can be acquired outside of the Gem Store.

#LONG LIVE THE GLITCH
---
Yup, I've seen that one too lol. I think it was on Tequatl in one of the foot zergs where it's usually pretty unsafe to stand still for more than a couple of seconds because of all the AoEs that get launched at you or getting feared half way to Divinity's Reach if you don't have a stun break off CD. I get that it takes a whole *5 seconds* to get back now with a mount, but c'mon.
---
I actually had an idea for double pistols on warrior a while back.
---
Was calling it the Drill Sargent (maybe commando)
---
Would either be able to specialize for medium range power damage + AOE might stacking.
---
Or use a combination of mantras to heal &amp; buff allies by yelling at them.
---
Artificial scarcity. They cycle content in and out of the gem store so people feel they have to buy when they see what they want.
---
Warrior good because very strong. Pick if want to kill enemy. 
---
Revenant good because strong and pretty. Pick if want to kill enemy and pick up girls.
---
Guardian good because can attac and protec. Pick if you want to be good dude.
---
Ranger good because strong and have pet. Also druid like trees. Trees good. Pick if you like oxygen.
---
Engineer good because smart. Pick if you want to kill enemy with smarts.
---
Thief good because sneak. Is best sneaker in game. Not so strong though. Pick if you don't like fight and prefer sneak.
---
Necro is good because can be reaper. Reaper strong. Also looks very good with scythe. Pick if you want to kill and pick up cute emo girl.
---
Mesmer is for girl, have purple and butterfly. Also very confusing. Do many clone who do no damage and then you die. More confuse myself than enemy.
---
Elementalist is strong because wizard. But is also weak and many buttons. Run around do fire boom boom lightning all elements but die when skritt throw a booger at you.
---
I would get Shooshadoo in a heart beat if they made the quaggin struggle then do the quagin Nooo! scream when you block.
---
Anet doesnt care about already released content. Just like this one or kourna.
---
Rezzing downed players is indeed a courtesy, with a caveat: given the opportunity, a competent downed player will have tagged weak mobs near them. Killing such mobs will get the downed character up on their feet faster than reviving them will (and is less dangerous, because reviving a player locks you out of most active defense).
---
Rezzing a *defeated* player is a waste of time under most circumstances, and will get you defeated too (because of the aforementioned active defense lockout).
---
Honestly, at this point I think the most sensible approach would be for Anet to implement a defeated state timeout: e.g. 30 seconds after defeat, you're automatically ported to the nearest uncontested waypoint. It's obvious players' behaviour isn't going to change in significant enough numbers to make a dent in this problem.

*Deep breath*
---
Berserker: cleave AoE condi spike damage.
---
Spellbreaker: dueling and WvW boon strip.
---
Dragonhunter: burst dps, AoE CC.
---
Firebrand: omegaLUL heals, condition cleanses, and stability.
---
Herald: Boons and other unique buffs on 10 allies at once.
---
Renegade: top condi dps and really strong PvE support. Can honestly be both at once.
---
Druid: busted PvE support, great 1v1er.
---
Soulbeast: kills everything. Tons of self-boon application.
---
Daredevil: extremely mobile with tons of unique dodges and AoE cleave damage.
---
Deadeye: 2nd best dps behind Chronomancer. 1,500 range on most attacks. Can also be a boon support.
---
Scrapper: tons of team support and it's very tanky.
---
Holosmith: unkillable AoE CC burst damage machine
---
Reaper: crazy damage, lots of chill application, hard to lock down and hard to burst
---
Scourge: barriers and tons of boon corrupt
---
Tempest: auras and other support things
---
Weaver: 2x harder to kill than Holosmith
---
Chronomancer: literally everything.
---
Mirage: ranged insta kill from stealth. Fun and interactive indeed.
---
OK, so as others are saying, there's not zillions available at any one time, but they rotate stuff.  Thanks for the info.

No problem, thanks for the info.

Ya it‚Äôs factually capable of putting out the highest numbers in the game....on the golem. Power chrono gets destroyed by dh/sword weaver/dd on sloth,kc,vg,Samarog,gorse,kc. When you base balance solely on dps benchmarks alone you can miss the real strengths that other classes have and what is holding power chrono back. Power chrono‚Äôs burst is very long and drawn out compared to dh who can unload all of its damage in 3 seconds and that difference is a huge deal for many fights. If you want an example of this literally look at the log from this deimos kill, on the 3rd signet the dh is able to capitalize on it and do a ton of damage whereas the power chronos weren‚Äôt able to output their burst as quickly so dh pulled ahead. So power chrono actually isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfactually capable of putting out higher damage numbers that any other class in the game‚Äù on a lot of fights and scenarios. 
---
I have been hoping for Bangar to wage war on the other legions for years literally! An important part are Tribunes as well. Rytlock is still a Blood Legion Tribune and I don't think he would approve of Bangar's selfish folly and try to convince the Blood Legion in Ascalon to remain with Iron and Ash. I have high hopes for the future of Rytlock. If he won't replace Balthazar as the God of War, he might as well replace Bangar as Blood Legion Imperator. 
---
I mean you should be saying that about Warrior. And Druid. And Chronomancer. 3+ years of those professions due to unique buffs / boon combinations is terrible balance. That Spirit and Banner effects haven't been addressed and that we didn't get elites with PoF that can do both Alacrity and Quickness really shows up how poor the general design variety is along with odd decisions about which healers can bring 25 might over 10 people and others that can't.

Silly question, but have you gone into the wardrobe section of your bank and tried on both skins? you should be able to see what it looks like stowed and in action.

you can make the decision based on that

Obelix, the guy who ress me more often then he should have too, this build is good for that too :P

Instead, spoil it today, nobody will believe you so its perfect!

You're forgetting the PvE part of the server. You can't just delete a server that might have 90% of its population engaged in PvE, raids, fractals, etc. WvW isn't for everyone.
---
And btw, quit whining about WvW getting no love. They're working on restructuring the whole thing (read the official forums if you doubt me). Yes, it's taking a while. No, there's no concrete release date for this. But they're working on it, which is good enough for me. And no one is forcing you to play. There are literally millions of other games you could play.
---
And no, why should they be working on GW3? We still have LWS4E6, and a whole (announced) S5 before another expansion probably lands. The dev team isn't that big. They don't have time to develop all that content, PLUS a whole new game on the side.
---
"Only 86% left of the bosses health. I just wait for rezz."
---
Technically yes, but only if you arent staff ele or rifle deadeye in circumstances that require more than 900 units range (for example Mursaat Overseer's gargoyles). Other than that classes like core condi ranger have good mid-ranged (900 units or less) weapons like axe main habd or shortbow. Granted you still stand within melee distance due to the spread attacks (like ranger axe 2) but on far larger bosses/hitboxes you can afford the little extra wiggle room to avoid AoEs.

It‚Äôs blood ruby. For the bloodstone fen track. Some of the others have them too. But some of the other episodes are pretty good too. Episode 3 is regarded as the fastest as you can quickly farm 50+ berries per character (much faster than other maps) but that‚Äôs less relevant if you want to wait out a reward track (much less pve time needed).

What alternative of superior rune of scholar can be used on thief/dd/de ? This is for open world roaming content and not fractals etc.
---
it's well known that delta steals player's DPS to speed up his own raid clears
---
Why are you memeing if its true?? Holo dps &gt; dh dps, dh has shit for dps outside of its burst. I dont understand why use a dh when you can use a holo, dh is basically like playing a crippled holo that just gets a bit higher burst and way worse real dps. 
---
&gt;This is how it works strictly in theory. There is a single best way to do things depending in your goal and like 80% of weapons do not fit into any build due to that.
---
So I get what you're line of thinking is, but I you've grossly exaggerated it. To demonstrate: I did you the favor of comparing the weapons used in meta builds on snowcrows.com to the actual weapons available for use for that class -- including expansion weapons, disregarding aquatic weapons, and counting main-hand/off-hand weapons separately e.g. main-hand sword and off-hand sword are considered separately. The results? **75% of weapons available are currently used somewhere in a meta build.**
---
Here's the numbers for the curious: 
---
Ele: 6/7 | Mesmer: 9/10 | Necro: 6/9 | Engie: 5/6 | Ranger: 10/11 | Thief: 4/8 | Guardian: 7/11 | Revenant: 8/8 | Warrior: 9/15 | Total: 64/85, 75.3% 
---
&gt;If it was up to me, traitslines would not give offensive stats, just different modifications to how you play and boons/ally support. 
---
Getting rid of offensive stats does not get rid of meta builds. There will still be a more optimal way of building the class. If you balance by boons and ally support then you'll have builds focused on shitting out the most boons possible. Also, I challenge you to think of a way to modify how you play a class without having one be better than another. Look how strong simply making dodges in-place evades is for mirage on bosses like Largos. By nature when you have multiple options, one will be superior. 
---
And if you did find some way to make no option inherently better than the other, to where they were all equal and nothing had enough impact to make it stand out congratulations! You just spent all that hard work on flavor text that means nothing to players. You might as well not have traits.
---
&gt;All weapons would be much more easily balanced that way, and you would not be pigeonholed into using the same traitlines because of damage.
---
Even if you were to get rid of traits, there would still be a meta build for weapons. With weapon skills being how they are, one is sure to been stronger than another. And if you continue to overbalance them like you did with traits, now you're to a point to where it doesn't matter what weapon you have or what button you press because all is equal. And even then, you have superiority between ranged and melee, because in some instances the ability to do the same damage at a range is invaluable, and in others cleave is king. 
---
Continue to "balance" things and you end up with a clicking simulator, where any input gets you to your goal all the same. Although I guess there is a market for those, so that's a possibility.
---
I apologize if any of this came of hostile or aggravated, I just don't think most people have a proper grasp on balancing things and the difficulty of doing so while still providing player choice and allowing their choice to have meaningful impact in the way they play. 
---
For as much as people shit on Anet class balancing, we don't give them near enough credit for what they've done so far. 75% weapon viability is pretty damn amazing.

Ah yes thief gives 0 utily except for the utily it gives that makes sense and no thieves are made for movement not dps thieves are already op in pvp  they dont need to do more dps 
---
Skillful gameplay is overrated. Gw2 is a casual game.
---
I love these professions because they are so simple to play. They are much more fun to play compared to ultra-complex DPS classes. No stress about perfecting rotation or messing up a complex rotation (which I do half of the time because I don't care enough). Spam few buttons and everything is dead already.
---
Nice meme. Trump is a russian spy tool too. 
---
As long as I'm still getting Kaspersky for free from work I'll continue to use it. Pretty sure Russian espionage has better things to do than backdoor some twenty year old gamer kid who has nothing better to do than virus scan app dll's at 5 am. 
---
You mean the mirage build thatll get you kicked everywhere
---
I am not an experienced firebrand, I got into it few days ago. That said I've done the math and some test already so here is my feeling. 
---
First thing, you want to keep perma quickness. This seems to be easily achieved. In fact I was able to do it with a 0 concentration stuff, only with permanent alacrity on me. This allows you to run offensive stuff if you want to be more a dps-support. Anyway in your case you will get concentration from giver and ministrel so you should be more than fine on the permanent quickness aspect.
---
For the healing part, you would have even more in ministrel than in harrier so there again you should be fine.
---
Finally, as other mentioned, you will have a lot of toughness with giver/ministrel, meaning you will probably tank on some raid bosses. With that much toughness you won't have any problem tanking, as long as you know the bosses mechanics. The hard part would probably to find groups who accept you if you're pugging. Some people don't want to mess with the meta. 
---
My suggestion is, if you don't want to tank, to replace some of your stuff with Magi pieces. You won't suffer from the concentration loss (at least for the quickness, not sure for the other boons) and still get plenty of healing without toughness.
---
So you want free rewards that shouldnt be yours You should have to put in effort not get free kills with everyone but you doing all of the effort if you play leave ur groups your not adding anything of value
---
It has 1 cc all 30 secs that's not even utility and mostly you don't even bring it with you. Thief in PvP is not outshining and except 1 shot de it's totally fine 
---
S/d Thief actually needs good amount of skill on top lvl games or you will get rekt to oblivien
---
No thief is skilless class for noobs in every place
---
xD any evidence for that? 
---
Your effort? I assume you are playing raids. Guess where the boons are coming from when you try to complete your rotation, deffinitly not from the weavers or the engis. Guess where the other 80% of dps comes from, surely not from you alone.
---
Raids are a teameffort, why are you even getting salty about someone else doing damage.
---
Only reason there can be is that you are getting outdpsed by those same players. Only advice I can give you then is - git gut.
---
You can outdps your average pug with any damage oriented build since none of them actually know how to play the game - including you probably. So again git gut.
---
Obviesly troll or another noob that get rekt by roamers all day
---
Pro tip play mirage in PvP then we talk about op 
---
There aren't any bad classes in GW2--only inexperienced, lazy or unprepared players.  If you don't like what someone is playing why not take it up with them instead of ranting on reddit and showing everyone how profoundly lazy and immature you are.  This game is more than a DPS subtraction equation and different classes bring different strengths, tools and capabilities to instanced PvE. 
---
No actually if you dont use meta you wont be able to beat raids youll hit enrage and die most dps only do 5k afetr chrono nerf
---
Show me how you read 36k on rifle deadeye. Benchmark is 40k.
---
Thank you for this entertainment.
---
The game should reard skill but it doesnt so chronos do most dps now

Thats ez just spam 1 and 5

No play soulbeast or thief or firebrand then we talk op

There's plenty to do as a new F2P player and the game is plenty alive. I'm not gunna lecture you on why you should try it, it's free for that reason. Just download it and try it out, there's nothing to lose.

Yea but using any form of transportation instead of going on foot anywhere can cause many problems too. Still recommended to use them.

A new player, like you are talking about, might well have problems with it.

There's no smoking gun, but they look a little bit suspicious for sure. 
---
&gt; Kaspersky previously had publicized its help in bringing down Lurk, which allegedly stole up to $45 million from Russian companies and banks. But it was not known that Kaspersky allowed an FSB agent to be inside its Moscow office to supervise the operation. 
---
&gt; "For any commercial security vendor to be overtly involved in work like that is extremely unusual. You're basically doing an offensive cyber operation, targeting an individual system's people on behalf of an intelligence organization."
---
&gt;

&gt; The company's founder, Eugene Kaspersky, graduated from a KGB-supported cryptography school and had worked in Russian military intelligence.

You need to equip them at the exact same slots tho
---
Well, you are right, but hearing "this sucks and makes no sense" after explaining to someone why some players can simply buy their gear and be good for all content while others have to tediously level up crafting, get super expensive recipes and extra pricey materials just to be okayish. Or that on some maps half of their loot is account bound worthless trash that cannot be sold and either has or has not eater that can be acquired through soe obscure achievement.
---
After hearing "this game makes no sense" from new people for half a year (and loosing new members after a month or two of them playing) I really start questioning if GW2 is really as good as this subreddit claims... 
---
According to gw2efficiency, top account is 35,381 hours, though I'm sure they just leave the game open 24/7. Still nuts. Top 90% is 6,050+. You're not too far off :P
---
Yeah you're totally right, and I never usually do either. But man Clerics just keeps being relevant somehow, even in pve, let me give just a couple of examples:
---
Clerics until 1400 toughness was always best for heal tempest for example, which was a staple of training squads for certain bosses.
---
Right up until harriers was released Clerics was the strongest option for druids until they reached 1400 toughness because it gave more personal dps over magis.
---
Until the recent nerf to chaos, Clerics was also bis for heal chronos in semi hardcore fractal groups.
---
The value of Clerics was that magi's and harrier's trinkets are far more difficult to obtain. And in any place that toughness checks can be avoided and extra concentration isn't required Clerics just leaps ahead, also in many wvw scenarios Clerics has been incredibly valuable as a stat. I know its a bit of a meme, but it's still not a totally useless stat. I think it's useful enough often enough to at least carry a set of them somewhere on your account.
---
Also if you enjoy it, the expansion is not that expensive, I paid 10 Euro for heart of thorns and I guess if there are special offers you can get both for 30,-
---
But...tempest only has 1 out of 8 skills applying swiftness by default!
---
^ Anet adding boons to air skills
---
So trying to tell me the chance of deltaconnected putting something bad in his dps meter that is used by the entire raid community is worse than 1 in 114? Some people...
---
What exactly out of the fractals is what I should be looking for to make gold? I know the exotics can cost a handful of gold on the TP and I don‚Äôt want to spend all I have on those items unless I know a reliable way to make some cash back. Not looking to make hundreds. 
---
Fantastic, I would've never guessed that. That makes me glad to hear. Thanks for the sub recommendation.
---
They just want a soft rub to calm their dead bodies. 
---
ah, you are the type of weaver that gets carried. nice
---
Cosmetics in this game are limited time purchases.
---
Also a good number of cosmetics are only accessible through rewards and achievements. (Example being the Hall of Monuments, which requires Guild Wars 1 account link and completing achievements in Gw1)
---
Other than that, all cosmetics are available from buying the unique Exotic from TP, crafting them, reward tracks, and farming map currency to trade in.
---
Everything can be earned, provided yu have the drive to go for it. 
---
The only ones which give people headache are those RNG drop ones from various bosses and Event boxes. 
---
&gt;  Pick if you like oxygen
---
I spit out my coffee! Thanks lol
---
Sounds like a great system to me, thank you for the reply and information!
---
Tempest is very playable though
---
Let's also talk about how most if not all Warhorn skills have disgustingly long cooldowns, with the exception of Ranger.
---
*Enchanted Snowball + Mini Angry Snowball*
---
I used to leave my game open afk ing in Lions Arch and HoTM back when i went to school. I am currently sitting at around 12k Hours, most likely played around 8k of those. This game litterally was my childhood &lt;3
---
Most of the gold comes from opening [fractal encryptions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cracked_Fractal_Encryption) early on so focus on doing your daily recs. Later on you'll have higher chance at good loot like ascended items and chests. You'll also be able to get all 4 tiers of chest just by doing the T4 fractals.
---
Nope. That is a half-double crochet stitch for sure.
---
No, Have enough powercreep as it is in this game.
---
as long as it would involve instant revive after being downed I would be up for that!
---
Heal Scrapper got nerfed, and Heal Tempest is a good substitute that can also provide some superspeed.  Also when traited, you can Arcane Blast while attuned to earth to instantly immob 5 people from 1200 range.  It's really powerful actually.
---
All of season 4 is a buggy mess.
---
So hyped!  Glad you all had a good time, and definitely looking forward to more of yall joining the server!
---
Does this count?

Nice character by the way! looks dashing.
---
Just do what they did with Paragon, have it come back for magical reasons.
---
Or do what guardian does in the water now, He doesn't actually throw the spear. He uses it as a magical tool to create a spear of light that he does throw.
---
Or in the warriors case they could just have it on a chain that he yanks back.
---
In any case a spear is a polearm &amp; the warrior/guardian definitely use it as such under water.
---
Great! *_* And thanks, its my main character, a holosmith :)
---
Yeah the gold is usually in the fractal encryptions and the keys you get from your daily‚Äôs.
---
Having classes that does all the things better doesn't make tempest "not a very playable option" imo. I play tempest in raids, wvw and fractals and i guarantee you it's pretty viable.
---
okay what i meant in simple terms is
---
buff power reaper
---
buff power berserker
---
buff power rev
---
&gt; I love the monthly anti-arcdps posts on this sub. I get that you guys are butthurt about bad dps or whatever but take it easy on the rest of us with your hate.
---
Are you for real?
---
That comment seemed to me to be about keeping your sytem secure and not anything about dps. And I think there is a subtle difference between suggesting not to trust everybody on the internet and hating people.
---
To this day I still think they missed out on a great opportunity to make summoning skills with warhorn, kinda like ranger 4 but cooler :/ especially on ele... Imagine a fire skill that summons a swarm of lil exploding imps. And you DO use your horn to call for aid, after all, don't you? Ain't that right, Boromir? 
---
Just doing your daily tasks will net you 2 gold a day, so within a week you should have the money to gear up in exotics, with at least a cheap rune+sigil variant.  
---
Doing daily fractal recs, even at t1, will also get you some nice golds a day. That is in addition to learning the mechanics which you'll need to nail down as you progress in the tiers.‚ò∫  
---
Starting from fractal 20, you are going to need agony resistance which you can only slot in ascended gear. This is going to be quite the money sink(a single ascended piece can cost around 40g to craft), so don't worry about those for now.  
---
You could occasionally also hop in for an hour to one of the major money farms and make 15-20g~ an hour to make the money back.
---
It's like every other transaction on the trading post, as the currency exchange uses the same transaction fee of 15%.
---
Question about mesmer, if i destroy a clone with mind wrack is it double damage against an enemy because the explosion happens from the clone and myself?
---
For the first time since since LS3 I will be able to play on patch day .. hope there aren't any bugs stopping me :D Will be really fun :D
---
Fixed after 2.5 months of release while the sigil cost spiked up from around 1g to 18g for like 2 months lol.
---
Fixed my tail.
---
If it would not be the case you would get infinite gold by exchanging back and forth.
---
**Transaction fee** is a 15% fee for trading gems for gold or vice-versa. For example, exchanging 1 Gold coin gives 85 Silver coin worth of gems while reselling those gems returns only around 72 Silver coin 25 Copper coin, resulting in a net loss of roughly 28%.
---
From the wiki.
---
Play for about two hours every four months and forget the game exists the rest of the time pretty much sums up my relationship with GW2 at this point.
---
won't take a lot^^
---
Worth playing in 2019? Absolutely
---
Worth playing for free? No way. Having only 2 characters not able to talk to all those fancy lightbulbs cruising on their shiny mounts while you walk from A to B.
---
well, not everyone even in real life have perfect teeth^^
---
Even the different races' story isn't a thing, though it's commonly misunderstood. You can only get the mastery points for a level 10, 20, and 30 block once no matter how many races you play as. The first time you clear one of those blocks, you have the mastery point and the other races' story will just give you the achievement/ap.
---
thank you&lt;3
---
This was very helpful. Going to save this for later and get to work on all that. Thanks very much for the help :D

It will probably be like the time condi chrono was "a thing", on condi bosses this and power that. More interesting is whether or not mantras will be patched to 10 players. If he wants to heal I guess harrier but if you want a build that is viable in instanced content I would still wait. For open world there are cool builds on metabattle.com 
---
I love it, especially for open world.
---
Ranger greatsword gets even more maul spam
---
Guardian greatsword gets some nicer cooldowns
---
Mesmer illusion / phantasm generation feels a lot faster
---
etc
---
Yes. Player character counts as a clone for this purpose as well. You can even shatter for damage with _no_ clones up, and you will still damage the enemy if you are close enough. 
---
Mm, I‚Äôm not 100% sure about that but it _should_. Typically the rule of thumb is if you can see the cooldown timer of the skill, it will reduce it. 
---
I know for certain it reduces the CD for swapping attunements, so I‚Äôd think it would work for the overload CD as well. 
---
There was a X-Force character name Meme at some point. Maybe the guy just likes comics.
---
Anet not giving warhorn to Guardian because... I don't know why honestly...
---
That's what those goblin-gnome inbred science rats say, right?
---
A lot of people answering your question but I don‚Äôt see anyone actually addressing _why_ so I thought I‚Äôd chime in. The point of the transaction fee is so you can‚Äôt play the market like stocks. 
---
For example, if the trade was 1:1 a rich player could invest a couple thousand gold into gems and just sit on it. Then, if gem prices rose during a sale he could cash out his gems and he‚Äôd have more gold than he put in. Rinse and repeat, it‚Äôs basically free gold from just playing the trends. 
---
You can still do it with transaction fees but it becomes much hard to pull a profit worth your while.
---
Omg that‚Äôs one of my favorite asura female lines! 
---
Level 9 + 10
---
I play scepter/shield and great sword guardian in fractals and never been kicked or had anyone naysay it. Granted have been in fractals in a few months
---
Every time you complain about tengu, The Wall gets 10 inches taller.
---
If your end goal was to make gold, then yes, it's a loss. The gap is there to prevent people fluctuating the currency market, I think. Also a way for gold sink so economy doesn't hyper inflate...
---
Guardian for the builds and Mesmer for the utility. Third tier is Revenant.
---
All pve content is now hosted on "megaservers." Your information is wrong. 
---
Wait, how did heal scrapper get nerfed?
---
&gt;  In raids, a power quickness FB will need some diviner gear (or other sources of boon/quickness duration)
---
I believe with full berserker + scholar runes, a Firebrand would only need Potent Lucent Oils and Soul Pastries to achieve the same amount of boon duration as Fractals. Not that big of a change honestly. More BD would just help comfortably keep 100% quickness.
---
PGP signatures! no-one would use them but it would be nice.
---
I avoid this Reddit like fire when its on its summit. 
---
I think they reduced / eliminated the superspeed application.
---
Good morning!
---
I‚Äôm a  returning player, my wife is a new player. We are refugees from WoW, and we are excited to find a new MMO to sink our teeth into together. Currently, we are leveling a ranger (her) and a guardian (me), with the hopes to end up being a Druid and dragonhunter on my end. 
---
My question is this: are there any iconic class pairings that would work really well together, or is this good? I know, obviously, the ultimate answer is ‚Äúplay the class you enjoy‚Äù, but I‚Äôm just wondering if certain classes will play better together than others. She seems to really enjoy ranged game play, while I‚Äôm pretty flexible.
---
Thanks for your insights!
---
It would be great if they just removed most of the CC in this game, but HoT's breakbar mechanic really made competitive game less fun.
---
Long Live the Lich is for free to unlock till tomorrow - Jan. 7
---
Yeah, I didn't want to sound harsh as I personally don't really care and I do agree with you atleast on the part of deepstone, you don't have to do that.
---
The Jahai story I assume a lot of players **want** to play though (and if you played it you know you get up close and personal with a giant spider for a considerable amount of time). So I actually feel like that is contradictory to their statement on the spidermount. If I'm around when the AMA happens and I remember I'll ask it.
---
Well I must have been lucky because the only problems I and everyone seemed to have was in Long Live the Lich, others went smooth with just little crashes which were understandable.
---
Huh, I never thought of it that way, you're right that for the base classes (except thief and mesmer) there's no resource to manage other than cooldown, so you basically just click stuff at the most opportune time when they come off cooldown. Elite specs did introduce really good "tempo" to how most of the classes.
---
I would argue they still miss the mark with Revenant though, the unique mechanic from herald and renegade doesnt feel that it changes the profession enough, I always felt that Revenant gets one more weapon, one more legend, and some traits whenever I switch between herald and renegade.
---
Yes but excluding charr from the termn humanoid is just wrong 
---
Remember kids. Playable =\= optimal.
---
Thanks for the answer =)
---
I‚Äôll donate exactly three hugs for this post. Thank you.
---
NANIIII ?!
---
&gt;Started playing gw2 recently
---
Not sure why the down votes, this isn't a thing in most games so it isn't something a n00b should know automatically.
---
killohurtz has it right. It lets you look around and do some tricks (depending on your profession).
---
Here's a pretty good breakdown of camera and targeting options, why, when and how: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y2czD6BREw 
---
They should make a minionmancer warhorn spec for revenant
---
after the dagger/dagger nika assassin.
---
The main movement of camera is set by 2 different operations;
---
1) left mouse button, moves the character in which ever direction you move the mouse.
---
2) right mouse button, moves the camera in which ever direction you move the mouse
---
Hope this helps.

Our wiki actually has a list of every totally unavailable item. [It's pretty short.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_unobtainable_wardrobe_unlocks)
---
Naaaw
---
I came here to say exactly this.
---
First time having this issue also. Waiting to find the report system also, however I am happy to have made one person out there happy!
---
Sure.. But also Do NOT go on Reddit, forums or any social media where leaks are possible.
---
There will always be one person who doesn't do a spoiler tag or do it properly... So just avoid them.
---
Which one can do more pushups? That‚Äôs the real question here.
---
"xD" isn't though.
---
I monitored a springer jump using the mumble link API and Python. It gave me https://imgur.com/gallery/ZOqlAqu.  
---
I used numpy .polyfit to fit a second-order polynomial (green line), results were z(t) = -15.19653312 t¬≤ + 59.34598262 t + 72.22531465. Leading coefficient is half (my mistake) the gravitational acceleration, so around 30 m/s¬≤.  
---
It seems huge, so I double checked. I have a Python script giving me my instant speed, I used it to monitor my fall from some high place, I do reach the terminal speed (around 25 m/s) in less than one second, so an acceleration of 30m/s¬≤ makes sense.
---
aren't they super squishy like ele?
---
I think you can bunny up and glide into it. You don't need key at all,
---
Or just wait and go fire ele in peak time. Someone probably has it. :)
---
Old, old days before HoT, playing condi war on PvP was so fun .... almost passive fight leting people die on condis.
---
It's about time it gets nerfed.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
But what is there to fix? 
---
The game is very clear that if you switch an active skills then it's going to be cancelled in place of the new one, be it mantras or necromancer minions. 
---
And the solution is obviously to just run the same thing both on ground and underwater, if the skill doesn't change it's never cancelled. 
---
Or are you saying you want necromancers underwater to keep all of their minions while using a complete different set of skills? 
---
It would be a different story if mantras didn't work underwater, rendering the elite spec almost useless underwater, but as far as I can tell you can still equip every single mantra underwater. And with the QoL updates lately you can just change all your skills be it ground or underwater straight from the hero panel. 
---
So again, what is there to fix? 
---
This key is spawning. It just dont have a name. You can still interact with it.
---
No more minions. Please.
---
Move over. I‚Äôm joining. 
---
Thank you for the quick answer! I have tried to use the springer and glider, as shown in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bPImbcZuXs, but it seems to have been patched. I've not had any success after completing the fire elemental event niether.
---
I sincerely doubt it doesn't spawn for you - I think it just doesn't spawn very often which is \*generally\* fine since it regards group-related events. But it can be really annoying when you keep missing it.
---
Lol welcome to the club
---
They don't give a flying fuck about pvp, or wvw or anything that doesn't involve selling ugly skins. "B-but different teams.." yeah whatever
---
Fuck these useless clowns 
---
The problem is that she tries to align the camera with RMB to change the direction of the character movement and it just doesn't work - yeah, the camera turns, but the character isn't. But for me it works correctly - character changes course with a turn of a camera. Settings and actions made are same but outcome is different.
---
This is what I see when I wake up with sleep paralysis
---
Why are we bringing this back up?
---
Both kinda creepy and cool.  Homer been lifting though?  We really are getting all we can against the battle of kralkatorrik. 
---
That's wrong, the reason why it is wrong already being posted here.
---
Duff Beer curls, yes
---
&gt;	so how's yur day fellow dead guy?
---
See, there‚Äôs no M in that.
---
They're referring to double dagger which is by far the most played and best Deadeye weapon loadout. 
---
For what it's worth with double dagger you're pressing only 1 and 5 on the left hand side of your bar for most of the fight (you press 2 a bit near the end), but that isn't the only thing to do and trying to naively press 1 and 5 with no prior knowledge you'll barely do better than simply autoattacking in terms of dps.
---
Rifle deadeye is really difficult and unforgiving.
---
Still, I'm playing it as one of my main DPS classes and because the auto-attack chain is so fast, it's much harder than it sounds to get top DPS. 
---
It's in the drop list of the black lion chests atm.
---
Honestly,  these two probably pair really well as they can support each other,  go melee or ranged, transition well into late game, and have a variety of playstyles.
---
I could name other combos and try to rank them but they all pretty much are able to achieve what you ask with varying effectiveness.
---
Yes, that would be enough, as you need 12% quickness duration for theoretical 100% uptime. Probably the easiest way to adapt for people who don't have legendary gear, but I'm not sure whether it will be the most efficient one. And, at least in my opinion, some cushion of some extra % boon duration will be more than helpful in real scenarios.
---
Okay, He can have the purple ones.
---
This list is absolutely incomplete.
---
Source: Just looked at AT LEAST 5 different cosmetic items I've seen in game and would love to get, but they're no longer available. Like the black feathered wings. None of those items are on that list, I bet there's countless others, probably a hundred or more.
---
So it all depends on what you want to do. If you will mainly be achievement hunting or doing open world content (there is a lot of this and people from other games underestimate how much and how detailed it is) then it really doesn't matter much. Any two classes will do well together, it just depends on player skill. Some classes do better in open world, like necromancer. Dragonhunter+druid will be absolutely fine, you should be able to do everything fairly easily. 
---
For organized pve content, it is probably better to have at least one support class, and I personally prefer to have a DPS over 2 supports. This is because I can reliably have a solid damage dealer and at least 1 person will be doing their share of damage. I think your composition is again very solid here. Druid is a very strong endgame support class for basically everything in organized pve. Dragonhunter might not be the absolute top here, but it is still really solid. I am not sure what the absolute top would be, maybe weaver, but dragonhunter is near the top especially for fractals. 
---
For pvp/wvw, I am not really an expert, but I think dragonhunter/druid wouldn't be the best. But you could probably adjust to something like soulbeast/firebrand and do decently well. Again, I am not an expert here, so if someone contradicts me then they are more likely to be correct. I think dh is fairly weak in pvp, and firebrand is a stronger support than druid. Soulbeast is pretty solid, though, and does have ranged builds that use a longbow or axe so that fits that requirement. I hear the best 2 man composition is probably firebrand/scourge but it also depends on player skill a lot.
---
Got it in my 4th birthday present, yesterday.
---
The dyes you get from the Winter Chimes Kit are available on the TP, and they're fairly cheap. About 8-9g a piece
---
you posting this screenshot on reddit wont get them banned either
---
Necro minions are horrible to use cause sometimes they just do thing I absolutely don't want them to do. 
---
It would be fine if we could controll the AI like rangers can. But we can't. Therefore please no.
---
what fake news? 
---
For a second i thought it was a pvp matter and was almost going to do a shitpost about pvp thief bfor i saw the pve tag
---
It's nice to know I'm not the only sucker with 20k+ materials sitting on my alt in prep for this Longbow and then disappointed. And another 20k+ mats because of the mystery Greatsword, for the love of Ogden's great savings, I want a properly themed GS legendary.
---
I have also noticed from the sound clips of this preview that all I hear is a quickly speed up sound file of a Skill for the Draw Affect (reminds me of the new Guardian Staff 2# skill), even though it is a completely new sound, the projectiles sound like off brand light saber sounds too. The sound completely killed the rest of Pharus for me... I expected heavenly sounds at least similar to every other light exploding sound in the game but refined enough to be completely unique. I would have crafted it if it had good sounds and maybe I could have liked it more later.
---
After the GS I just want ArenaNet to refine the visual affects of lack luster Leg's like Rodgort, and adjust multiple visual scale issues on Charr. Example, the Arm affect of Nevermore sucks on Charr.
---
Login...do dailies 3/3  (with long stretches of non logins) see if anyone i know is online...Log out. 5 years on a game and i still don't want to do end game content. Still i will keep ranking GW2 as one of my all time favourite gaming experiences.
---
The key is tiny and has no nameplate so it can be very easy to miss if you've never seen it before. If you're NA I can help you find one.
---
High Sage in Lake Doric is bugged out too =(
---
nice kill and nice numbers, but thats very situational and for REALLY good groups only. in pugs you cant trust ppl with dodges, so gotta run SYG/stab mantra, and probably firebrand rune.
---
Maybe move it somewhere else. Boons are distracting enough as is I can't imagine having another 6 buttons on there to keep track of mid-combat.
---
The black feathered wings were on sale on the gem store a couple months ago. Like other gem store items, they‚Äôll come back on sale again in the future.  
---
*cursed image*
---
It does spawn but [it's a really small green blob](https://i.imgur.com/I6VPLns.jpg), almost indistinguishable from background static models; doesn't have name but shows interact button upon close proximity
---
Wow that's awesome, glad to hear! Feel free to message me with any other questions :)
---
I'm honestly surprised warhorn isn't a universal offhand.
---
ANet don't care.
---
Acknowledge that PvP in this game is left for dead and do it for the Reward Tracks/Gold.
---
If you look around Thaumanova, you'll see chaos shards all over the place. The key looks like one of those, but tiny, hardly visible.  So tiny it'll look more like a greenish smudge.   
---
And it doesn't have a name, so it won't be easier to see while holding Ctrl to show object names. You won't know it's it until you walk next to it and get the E-prompt to use it.
---
On top of that, it can also appear inside the bushes in the plant room, and it's impossible to see it there. So when it's in there you have to walk around those bushes until you get a prompt to use it.
---
... and gives swiftness too
---
"Now" *chuckles*
---
No. Totally unavailable means they can no longer be obtained, ever, in any way. Skins like black feathered wings that you mention are *presently* unavailable, and they do rotate them on the gem store. Those are two completely different lists and latter has no place on a list for former. 
---
How can we mark it right? Just by writing "[Spoiler]" in the title or is there some link/button like "NSFW" to mark it?
---
Begone, demon!
---
Tbh, never had any problems playing on the first day.
---
I have to agree with you. It would be so perfect for guardian.
---
Yup,
---
They could be stacked vertically next to the mount and novelties buttons, Limit it to 3 buttons :)
---
Are you me? I love GW2, combat, lore, map etc. but I feel after doing the same thing day in day out, it gets boring and time to move in.. then i try other games and im like, why arent games like GW2.
---
Ok, put this way is more acceptable
---
Edited that out iirc
---
Na bro
---
I would argue the opposite, its the addition of elite specializations that make things seem bland.
---
Early on, in the first year or so every profession had a pretty simple game flow they wanted to follow.
---
* Engi: control the tempo of the fight with heavy cc, overwhelm opponents with offensive combos for high spike damage. Overwhelm targets with low duration, but highly varied conditions in the case of condi builds
---
* Mesmer: harass and force foes to exhaust options with illusions, shatter to finish foes.
---
* Guardian: pressure targets with consistent damage, negate damage with aegis/ blind, reduce damage with protection, punish attackers with retaliation.
---
* Ranger: Overwhelm targets with damage from 2 sources, force targets to split damage between you and your pet, letting you out-sustain them  
---
* Necro: out-sustain targets with naturally high health, snowball off deaths to become increasingly more powerful.
---
* Warrior: overwhelm targets with high damage attached to a sturdy body, use burst skill to insure you kill before dying.
---
* Thief: use the best skill available to deal damage, utilize stealth for high burst (ye-ole backstab).
---
* Elementalist: use high damage combos for massive damage, utilize attenement swapping to either protect yourself, or heal, thus guarding your low base hp.
---
Not all these game plans were great at pve content in the strictest case. Since most weren't focused on maximum dps. For a long time mesmer was total trash in pve, since the only thing they brought was Time Warp. That said each profession did have a unique style about them.
---
It wasn't really until HoT people started getting focused on having max dps for everything all the time, due to the addition of raids. Ever since we've seen everyone complain about benchmarks, even when by design some specializations are not made to do top damage but support via other mechanics.

I manually leveled one of every class, so I could learn how they work. Duplicates of any class I just boost these days. I always urge new players to avoid using that shiny Level 80 boost until they've gone through the leveling process at least once.
---
I can say I have both of my boosters.... But time of knowledges were saved and I used them up after I leveled to the next as not to waste them lol. You are hardcore if you never used the time haha 
---
So it sound like if I want to focus on healing and support, I should really focus on Harriers so I dont have toughness that will draw aggro.
---
Do you think they will ever release a stat set that doesnt make healer/boon a tank?  I cant think of any stat sets that have major heal, minor concentration without having lots of toughness.
---
I'd love to see a Heal &gt; Vitality + Concentration stat set.  
---
Not sure if sarcastic but power mirage is also viable right now.
---
I did and I'm not going to be drawn into an argument with you, but you need to learn to read logs (*spoiler*: boss damage only isn't always a good metric) and then think about why certain compositions, including five power chronomancer DPS in this instance, are used.
---
It just give me an excuse to learn how to play the class and farm materials. Currently right now I am wrapping up central map completion on them. Just need to finish Guardian, Elementalist, and Thief.
---
The last one I leveled was my thief right after the Rev. Let me tell you it was very tempting to use that 80 booster.
---
I found it to be a little jarring when I went to GW2 the first time. I had only been playing WoW maybe 3 years by then and I almost always played a healer. The every-man-for-himself thing in GW2 can be a bit off-putting, but stick it out. It's kinda nice to be able to ficus a bit more on the target and less on the group. 
---
One thing you can't avoid is the need to get used to the various combo's. Certain attacks can generate a separate effect when combined with other attacks form other people. I've played GW2 off and on for a couple years but these days I still have trouble understanding it sometimes. I suppose if I played it consistently for weeks I could get used to it, but playing just a day or two every few weeks means I can never remember how to capitalize on this system. And it is a very cool system!
---
I think Guardian would be a decent first choice, but you'll want to make one of each class pretty soon just to see how they play. I think you will be glad to have started the game!
---
I miss old LA. Seriously wish they just rebuild this instead of the theme park we have today 
---
Same.
---
Ahhhh yes my account name. We do!! 
---
Always need more Moffett sass. 
---
Pretty much this. I got a message from some guild on discord that I got kicked due to inactivity but I can rejoin if I come back to the game by giving them a message. Not sure how worth is joining some guild just for two hours every couple of months.
---
Mine's working fine, must be a bug, or a an enemy that can't be knocked back? 
---

---
Since those boosters are stuck in the shared inventory slots you could do what i did and just use it on a lvl 80 character. This way you get the stuff from it and also two free shared inventory slots.
---
I hope they don't make player housing an expansion keypoint ever. It may be a nice pet project, it may even entertain some people for a while but it's ultimately a very shallow thing for a game. 
---
Not even for games like Wildstar where housing was superb in every regard did it ever become important enough.
---
mem eeeeeeeee
---
i have a heal fb and i went full harrier's with water runes,  a concentration sigil. and 3 concentration infusions for 100% boon duration, with that i got crazy heals + ez 100% uptime on quickness and fury; with alacrity ofc.  
---
i'm not an expert in support in general nor do i play it a lot, just wanted to share my personal experience.
---
If you are coming from a world top 250 guild and you want to raid here, you'll need to lower your expectations considerably. Raids are released far more slowly (we've had one new raid of 3 bosses in the past year), we don't have real variable difficulties like WoW and instanced PvE balance is poor. The community is also *very* keen on gating new players through kill proof requirements that make the dark days of GearScore look good - if you do want to get into raid check out training Discords such as the Crossroads Inn (EU). There are others on NA too.
---
In terms of healing, due to how boons in this game work, Druid is pretty much mandatory since it can provide a full stack of Might and Fury to a full raid group. It also has unique buffs that cement its spot in raids. However, actually healing has no finesse like WoW and instead you'll mainly be healing through targeted AoEs or point blank AoEs around your character - you cannot target people through raid frames. The content itself is also not challenging in healing requirements. The vast majority of bosses can be easily solo healed. This leads to healing feeling closer to spamming Wild Growth all over a raid group in the pre-WotLK patch and is miles away from any sort of triage or intelligent healing, never mind how much coordination was needed in early Cataclysm. At best, most encounters feel like Siege of Orgrimmar for healing - you'll either sleep through it or wipe to a mechanic. Don't expect things like chaining long duration CDs, stacking for healing or needing to cleanse individually based on target priority - that too is fire and forget AoE with a UI that supports awareness of conditions on allies very poorly.
---
There is some more variation for the secondary healer spot (with options that do have slightly different play styles) but there is nothing in this game close to healing Paladin in WoW. The closest you might get is Firebrand due to the conical abilities.
---
For versatility you really have two options at the moment - Ranger can go Druid for healing and Soulbeast for power (direct) or condition (DoT) damage. Mesmer is the other option and while it can't heal it has been broken for years in PvE with Chronomancer being 20% of a 10 man raid group for 3+ years due to bringing the boons Alacrity and Quickness (think Bloodlust, but on steroids, impacting cooldowns and attack speed, with ideally 100% uptime) while it now also has very strong power DPS and condition DPS options. Less likely to show variation in raids, but having some applicable in open world, are Necromancer, Guardian and Elementalist.
---
In theory, any profession can tank (and only a slim number of raid bosses actually need a traditional WoW style tank) but due to role compression and gear offering different stats, this tends to fall to the Chronomancer to do.
---
All that said, as an ex-WoW player who used to raid loads in that game, I've been here since WoD let me down. Part of that is because GW2's combat and movement will absolutely ruin other MMOs for you and the other part is the vain hope of PvE balance getting better one day!
---
Kitless Holo btw 
---
Yes.
---
The gem store do not have all items at all time they circle them. That does not mean they are not avaiable at all just not all the time.
---
Sadly no, PoF maps don't have engaging metas.  
---
On the other hand, HoT maps have mastered what a map wide meta should be, with the best one [Dragon's Stand](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon's_Stand).
---
Also haven't gotten a gift back :/ Was looking forward to see what my Secret Toymaker would come up with from the little poem/rhyme thingie I sent, haha. Happy I was able to successfully send a gift; they responded and thanked me :D
---
Not sure where to report either. Although it is past the deadline I still have hope that some of us will receive our gifts! Very possible that some are busy with real life or forgot
---
Does having an "original" game account really matter?
---
I bought this game in 2012 and played some, but didn't really get into it. I'm wanting to get into the game now, but can't recover my account. I've contacted support but it looks like they are out probably until Monday. I'm playing the free game now (used an alt email) and having fun, but I don't want to get too invested in my character if there are good reasons to play with my original account. Like, am I level limited on the free account that I wouldn't be on my original content account? If I can't access any of the new content until my character is of appropriate level, anyway, it would be good to hold off buying the expansion(s) I think...
---
Thanks.
---
I tried to write this exact thing but not as eloquently.  +1, thank you.
---
In the end, if the event isnt close to finish they have to respawn anyways, cuz they lose participation on the event and get no rewards.
---
I'm 100% sure she didn't. Tbh, I'm very confused about this problem, because neither I or my other friends who play too have ever encountered this issue. 
---
Follow up tidbits. You can even Shatter with zero clones. The effect occurs where your character is.
---
That's the best server ;) but I'm biased :D 
---
Same, I really liked that game even if you could be horribly unlucky.
---
Burn it with fire
---
Think I saw this guy the other day, he ended up half way through afking. But then started playing properly once we were winning by 100....
---
Downvoted but true
---
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
---
As someone who came in very late, I wish I'd gotten to see old LA. 
---
this is why the gods left
---
[fox](https://i.imgur.com/o6wG5cl.jpg)
---
I like this idea, I'm constantly asking myself why this isn't already a thing when we have a shortcut to seldom used novelties.
---
However this doesn't make anet any money, so it probably won't happen for a while if at all. 
---
Living World is the DLC-style PvE updates we get get between expansions. We are currently on Season 4 Episode 4. Season 1 is unavailable.
---
&gt;Don't talk to me or my progeny ever again.
---
ftfy
---
Or Tumblr.
---
In Spanish all vowels have the same pronunciation unless accented, so that makes sense. "E" is always pronounced 'eh' unless otherwise indicated.
---
Player lines are already expensive because they have to be read 10 times. So the creative team(&lt;-this is not a thing btw)  probably did "think about these things", looked how expensive it would be to do ~ 3*10 voices and decided not to do it.
---
But hey what do they know, they only do this for a living. Good thing there are armchair gamedevs who know everything better all the time.
---
That's because everyone will be bitching about how it's not an option *unless* it is stronger than all other ranged options. You already can use longbow **if you want to** but what people are claiming on this thread, which apparently evades your attention, is that they want it to be superior to scepter. Unless that is the case, there won't be satisfaction. Therefore yes, I would prefer the longbow to be total garbage.
---
Nowhere did I say I don't want build diversity.
---
"This is why the charr have no gods. They saw this in the future and left before introducing themselves."
---
On an aside I like how the charr hands are actual paws as they are in lore and not.... Whatever it is we got in-game.
---
Mm... Soft Charr fur...
---
&gt;80% of them have a British-like accent.
---
You're right. And it should have stayed that way. I'm not painting the game with a brush and saying all the VO is bad because most is great. Play the Norn story and when Sieran is talking to you it's night and day. Sieran is PERFECT, wonderful VO actor and the Norn sounds like a cross between Judith from 3rd Rock From the Sun, and Rem from Death Note! Monotone and bleh... (Maybe the Norn have the Eyes)? Not heroic, but maybe it's possible there will be magical journal that falls from the sky in the next expansion for the Norn. THEN it would at least be logically terrible... I don't want it to be bad it just IS.
---
Just hit 1000 hrs on my main character. Definitely worth playing!
---
Hey, the patch may have been broken all day, but that mount party was a hella good time.
---
Or Myspace.
---
For the Istan bug, I‚Äôm not sure what you mean regarding the GH and Palawadan (other than the already opened chests, but that‚Äôs not a bug), and they announced the fix to Akili is coming up in the next patch. Sandswept isles doesn‚Äôt have any bugs which I have seen and I‚Äôve done the fishing event a few times. Kourna doesn‚Äôt have bugs to my knowledge either but who cares about Kourna. In regards to Jahai, the bugged race was fixed a couple months ago.
---
hehe, yes we charr did not destroy our gods they sort of ran screaming x'D also i like to call the in-game paws "skeleton hands" :P
---
I remember this, now I'm sad.
---
Skritts aren't playable
---
Sadly
---
1 reason actually. It's a technical limitation of the engine that goes back to GW1. Items with charges cannot stack. Forgot the exact reason but that's the result.
---
Kind of surprised they didn't fix it when altering the engine for gw2 but either they didn't think of it or couldn't.
---
The problem existed before online store, let alone anything you listed. 
---
Whyy
---
Wow, just like Bart!
---
Despite everyone going 'hurdur cuz infinite tools profit' the actual reason is about 8 years older than the first infinite gathering tool.
---
It's caused by a technical limitation of the engine that goes back to GW1. Items with charges cannot stack. It's been so long since I heard it so I forgot the exact coding reasons but that's the result.
---
And people will start complaining at the eventual gold sink for the decorations...

No thanks! I rather keep my home nodes instance farm instead xD

[Here's my build for Fractals and Open World PvE](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNAW3ensADNCjFBDuDBkCjlHCbveePDoYBgGwHIr9MfyAA-jRyGQB3UnQJ1EAgjAgKVCOk9HSpyvgq+T/eAAk7iAQKgAHsB-e)
---
You can swap the swap for a mace/shield and change your food to Delicious Rice Balls if you want to focus more on healing. Staff is a big part of your might generation, so it's important to run it if you are replacing a Druid. This build can actually quite comfortably replace both a Druid and a Chronomancer in Fractals.
---
At the moment we don't even know if/when there will be another expansion.
---
Even if I like housing, I think it shouldn't be the main part of an expansion. The main part should be something a large percentage of the players will use regularly like mounts, gliders etc.
---
Kinda true, just put this hastly together in the preview and it does resemble more to voldemort with that face haha:D [https://i.imgur.com/1UJJks0.png](https://i.imgur.com/1UJJks0.png)
---
By Ogdens Hammer! 
---
I would be fine with that placement, if they reworked the boon display to have static positions.  Boons jumping back and forth is the main reason they are so distracting.
---
Equal. Footing.
---
30k dps with scepter, 30k dps with longbow.
---
Build diversity and preference.
---
Since all that matters in pve is dps, every weapon should be within 20% of each other. If they want low dps builds and high dps builds to be viable, then we need more options that are impactful without cobtributing dps like chrono, druid, banners. If there are not options like that, then dps is all that matters and not buffing a weapon that doesn't offer dps is a disservice to the players that find said weapon fun/attractive for whatever reason.
---
I always like to read elite spec concepts, so please don't let my nitpicks discourage you.
---
1. The lore of spellbreaker is that they were Sunspears, who cut off the blade of their spears in order to blend in and not be recognized. Having another elitespec having spears would feel a bit weired, at least for the expac right after PoF.
---
2. Cross winds should probabl not be a chain, but a flipover that appears when the first skill lands. The difference is small but relevant, since blocking the first skill would be a form of counterplay.
---
3.The Name 'Eye of the Storm' is already taken by a tempest shout. While double ups arn't unheared of they are bad style since they lead to confusion.
---
4. A defensive f-skill (even if only on the weapon) kind of doubles up with the spellbreakers full counter (even the names are similar) what would this specs unique niche be? 
---
5. 3 Dodge bars on a warrior seem unwise. This is a class that already has a decent amount of options in terms of damage mitigation and it's hard to see what the role difference between the Windreaver and the spellbreaker would be in sPvP.
---
eAT

PANT

If you are on desktop after you make a post you have the option to flair it and choose spoiler. But simply putting [Spoiler] in title still helps and if anything the mods will see it and flair it.
---
Weapon and armour vendors such as those in home cities will sell you white equipment appropriate for your level.  
---
Another option is to go on the trading post and narrow the parameters down.
---
dont forget to watch a yt vid on season 1, then do season 2, hot, season 3, pof then season 4 in that order.
---
OH GOD NO
---
Is it possible to do guild missions for multiple guilds? I saw you could get ascended accessories with guild commendations and I was wondering if I did it for multiple missions that I could get those accessories faster.
---
They have the medium-level health pool, just like rangers, revenants, and engineers. They have the highest amount of *active defense* in the game. This means that instead of relying on passive abilities like ranger pets, necro minions, or high health to deal with attacks, they rely on evades, blocks, and distortion (brief invulnerability) to evade attacks. In end-game content, including open world in level 80 zones, every class is pretty squishy. You just can't facetank everything and spam 1 to victory, unless you're a fully traited necro with minions. This game isn't designed for tanks. Mesmer has a very active playstyle that rewards quick thinking and knowledge of your abilities, imo :d
---
This is so awesome
---
Who?
---
i dont know why ppl reccomend not using a booster, i boosted my 3rd character but still did the storyline from L10 up on that toon. i reckon it's better to have full skills available and a decent build wearing exotics so that you can learn the build as you play.
---
why have lower level traits when you are just going to discard them for the meta anyway, better to learn the meta build from the very start.
---
It is very good at being an anti-virus software.
---
However, over the past couple years, the United States Government, Military, and Intelligence agencies have all said not to use it. Additionally some European and Asian countries governments and/or intelligence agencies have said the same due to the company appearing to be lying about having no relation to the Russian government.
---
One post another user posted but you can do a simple search and find tons of articles about it. If you want to keep using it than that's fine, but it's banned from all Federal computers in the US for a reason.

Does anyone know if ANet has acknowledged this botting crisis? I‚Äôm curious to know if this has caught their intention enough to stimulate some sort of future changes.
---
Yeah except no one will bother even saying spoilers for the videos that are made on it for YouTube
---
Of all possible replies the big burly charr could have delivered, the best he could do was "NO U".
---
Man, why did I not join GW2 when it was new? So much regret. So much I didn't get to see or hear...
---
To add to this: try and kill neutral creatures in "empty" parts of the map as they can give big amounts of bonus xp (bonus xp rises when a foe hasn't been killed for a while).
---
It seems to be the only way to get them to actually do their jobs. How many times have they taken action without the community getting in an uproar? I can't think of any
---
You'll need to be more specific. When you try to submit the form are you getting an error message? Have you tried using a different browser?

Let's write creepypasta about this image
---
The process to make this weapon is pretty dark. You raise a baby quaggan from an egg in a fish tank so you can use it to facetank a raid boss or legendary. Payback for those incredibly annoying hot springs quaggans in Bitterfrost Frontier \*cough*
---
I don't think or hope that classic player housing will be a thing, there might be something similar in the works thought. We already have some player housing features in guildhalls and we do have a home instance. The latter has not been very relevant except for harvesting nodes, kittens and 1 side story for a long time. We did however get a personal upgradable instance this LS Season. There is an argument to be made that this instance was a test of sorts for a 2020 take on a home-instance-like feature that could come with the next XPac.
---
Im not getting any error messages. It just sits the on the page with no change or loading next page. I tried on firefox, internet explore and chrome.

That was what I used when I first started playing last year.  :)  Very handy!

And that is your choice.

Personally, I will never use nor recommend Kaspersky. Same with Huawei and Xiomi devices for similar reasons though the biggest is just because I feel their UI is garbage and I went through 8 Huawei Nexus 6P.

Hmm.. nah, I preferred the disenchanted ones

If you scroll back up the page, is there any red text indicating a field has been left out or has an error in it?
---
I havent gotten an email. I cant log on because to reset password it keeps asking for a character name.

i think it looks awesome! the colours mesh really well with your sylvari's bark colour and the hair also contributes to the theme of an udnerwrater leaf, great work. look forward to seeing what else you make :)

Wasn't Zerker the go to stat combo for every class in PvE since ~1 year into GW2? I mean people were going for max damage long before HoT. Dungeons were usually filled with 3-4 Warriors due to high damage and sturdiness, one Mesmer for their elite and reflects and one occasional Thief for skips and defiance stacks. All wore Zerker and went for max damage.
---
its not letting me do an anonomuse log in

Hello! New to GW2 and I just hit level 80 on my guardian. Been watching a lot of Twitch and YouTube and notice that there aren‚Äôt much firebrand guardians in any raid comp or even fractals. I know everyone prefers other support classes over firebrand. 
---
So basically what I want to know is will it be hard for me (firebrand guardian) to get into a raid group whether its condition dps or support, and if so should I switch to another profession. 
---
Thanks in advance. 
---

I'm sorry if I sound like I'm picking nits. I just want to make sure you're in the right place. If filling out that form to the best of your ability and hitting Submit doesn't work, you might try doing it from another computer or your smartphone. It seems to be working fine for me right now.
---
who cares? pvp and wvw are just minigames
---
It's an outfit, that's barely fashion wars. At most you're going to play with colors. 
---
Get armor skins, play around with how they combine with each other. 
---
???
---
I leveled my first character manually, used a few tomes on the second one but no more than 5 I think. Nowadays when I make a new class I use a mix - level 20 scroll to get the first boring part out of the way, play story/open world and use a few tomes to get to the next story chapter when I feel like it. I like that way of getting familiar with a class bit by bit. Once I feel like I've grasped the basic idea of the class (usually happens around level 60), I boost to 80.
---
I've also made duplicates of each of my two main classes, and those I just insta-boosted. It feels weird to play a crippled version of a class I already know, it's not fun to me.
---
&gt; Is the game P2W? Do I have to pay real money for items or can I spend some time to grind them out?
---
You can get best in slot gear with $ - buy gems (premium currency) for $, buy gold for gems, buy legendaries (best weapons) and materials for leveling crafting and craft best armor. It's rather expensive, but every title with IAPs banks on whales.

Try to find some more fitting dyes that go with your character's skin color / night glow etc, perhaps try to use a different staff skin, the [Aureate Staff](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aureate_Staff) is a cheap but solid skin to use and would probably fit your char well.
---
nice screen shot!!   
---
you used regular windows PrtSc or software to capture it?
---
One other reason you should get Heart of Thorns is that one class is not available until you get the expansion and that is the Revenant. It is the only class locked through expansions. However you can play it from level 1-80 just like any class as long as you have the expansion. It is the only reason to buy the expansion before you get a level 80 character. Outside of that the expansions only really add content to the game for level 80 (max level) characters.
---
However buying an expansion if pretty much the only way to upgrade your account from a F2P to a fully unlocked account. A F2P account will allow you to play the core game in full but has some minor restrictions. Like you won't get log in rewards, limited use of the Trading Post (GW2 version of the Auction House), and your ability to communicate.
---
Hopefully this info will also help you.
---
Ideally need to get a youtuber or twitch streamer involved though.
---
It seems ANet's company policy is to appease the media first of all, so need to blow something up big so they want to save face. Shameful really, when you ought to be showing that **exactly** this has **no** effect, everyone is treated the same way 100%.
---
None of that helped :/ i cant even open the game to login, like it crashes as the launcher is starting. bit confusing :/
---
I also renamed the d3dll or whatever file to "ReShade" and the game opened fine but the gw2hook or reshade wasnt working, nothing was showing up
---
Well.. DoNotD.. from the vid üôÇ
---
Am on FA and I love it. I came from Maguuma and have been trying to make FA Team Chat Mag team chat since I got their. 
---
&gt; Thief: use the best skill available to deal damage, utilize stealth for high burst (ye-ole backstab).
---
This is a pretty bad plan in PvP or WvW, unless it's your first combo if you play a stealth build
---
That prep skills don't reactivate. That's there to fix.
---
I agree most of the bugs are fixed or team is trying to fix or whatever. This is ok for me in an mmorpg and it's developers job to fix the bugs anyways. I'm trying to say every new map comes with a bunch of bugs and the "bug fixing patches" sometimes causing new bugs. The guy should have changed the comment to "All of season 4 'was' a buggy mess" imo.
---
About GH and palawadan tho, GH was preventing Palawadan to start and vice versa back in the day.
---
Hello!
---
I really want to find a fun condi or hybrid thief or engineer build for WvW roamer. Does anyone know of any? It will be off meta ofc but that's the fun of it:) any suggestions appreciated!
---
Not much to rate, though. You're using an outfit, not really using your creativity there to come up with a cool look. 
---
&gt;The below screen shot, shows just an idea of where they could sit for example.
---
Yay, more UI! (I know, just an example :P).
---
However, I would prefer a new window for it. A new symbol at the top left and a new hotkey to open it (if you want). 
---
The window itself could be like an inventory. Maybe even with inventory functions, so you can not only link your shortcuts, but also store your item of choice in yout Shortcut-Inventory. 
---
Let's say it has five slots and and each slot is assigned to a shortcut, which can be changed in options ofc. 
---
So you would have your food/utility stuff out of your actual inventory and can easy switch the items.
---
I would also agree to see this variant as an gemstore item, since it's the same kind of qol stuff as shared inventory slots are, imo. It could be like you have 2 free slots and you can upgrade up to 5 or 10 slots maximum. 
---
Great community, btw.
---
You can type /age in game to find out! 
---
&gt;so need to blow something up big so they want to save face
---
Just like Price and her "white knight" Fries firings that happened 6 months ago? [](#s "I still don't understand the exact of the 2 reasons that got her kicked, but it made me really interested in how Anet keeps things under control when there are various loudmouths behave like that in other companies.")
---
How do I request an airstrike in this game?
---
Mounts are great fun, go for it imo. 
---
using a phone worked. thank you grey. not to wait for a reply from them.
---
Do you have any adblockers or add-ons like that in your browser? 
---
Anet doesn't care because 99% of the population is cosmetic collecting jumping puzzle completing casuals that are happy to make their character look dumb as fuck for 50 bucks
---
Yeah, because it took 6 years to have enough novelties to have a demand for sortcuts/wardrobes. 
---
You have the exact same situation as me, I think it's definitely worth it! Make traveling so much quicker and will honestly probably save you hours worth of time over the course of the story. Also it's only $15 on Amazon right now (and if you pick it up before the 8th, you can get episode 4 of the living season for free)
---
That is awesome. I hope you have fun.

I disabled them and it didnt work before. Its all good now got ticket submitted.

Are there any fun ways to play Warrior? I would like to have a very mobile Warrior where I have to evade and block often (pay attention to what I am doing) and dish out high amounts of damage.
---
As someone that played the base game.. Then had all their friends and themselves quit because the story was extremely bland. The classes all felt the same.. and the beautiful world design was all the game had going for it.. I definitely think they went the right direction with this one.
---
Correct me if i'm wrong but isn't weaver one of the highest DPS in the game right now?
---
It's me :)
---
If I were you I'd wait there for a month if I had to.
---
&gt;PvE has always been their priority in the first place and if today we lack some content in PvP it is about how the developers choose to build their game around, it is not a money related issue at all.
---
Resources = money. Arenanet are playing it safe by investing in churning out tried-and-tested story-mode/raid PvE guff. 
---
It's popular content that's easy for them to create-and-forget. No post-release balance is required, nobody has to decypher previous programmers' weird code. Competitive mode content is the opposite.  
---
That's why competitive modes are more-or-less in Maintenance Mode.
---
Because they know they're wrong.
---
Well done
---
I really liked HoT (it had some of the best map design imo) as well and think they have been moving in the right direction ever since LS S2 started, but the production value in terms of instances, cutscenes and Maps has really started to shine since the start of LS S4. 
---
Not necessarily true, deadeye can pretty much infinitely stay in stealth. Other thief builds have more trouble with it though.
---
Eat pant
---
There is only one mount, Griffon, which can fly or technically glide, griffon requires you to complete pof storyline + a collection which costs 250G.
---
 The others would be for vertical and horizontal movement, each have a unique trait, the Springer can jump and get you to height, skimmer is fast on water and such these mounts don't cost much gold, the max is 20g for jackal, raptor is free, Springer and skimmer cost less than 4g. The mounts would definitely make gameplay easy. Note that gliders are unlocked with HoT and would not be included in PoF purchase. 
---
And then you'd have pay for it and not a cheap price 
---
At the moment, many players and groups are experimenting with firebrand as alternative to druid for fractals. You should check it out.
---
I'm sure you're a smart enough person to figure out which videos will contain spoilers though.  Or just wait to watch coverage for a day or two.
---
the story is soo mess up that even spoiler become pointless
---
Sounds like you wanna play spellbreaker. Depending on Gamemode Axe/Shield + Dagger/axe or Dagger/shield + Greatsword might be what you are looking for. Shield is not really usefull in PvE, but since you wanted blocks‚Ä¶ Full counter fells like a block anyways. For further mobility consider bulls charge (als procs peak performance).
---
what's your ingame name I'll come rez you! (whisper Sunspear Exile)
---
Are you the real anet
---
Not sure how basic you need it. But basically you gather materials from the world (or buy them on trading Post) and then slowly craft different types of stuff. You start with low level stuff and then gain experience to be able to craft higher level stuff. 
---
In this game specifically it's mostly used to get your first set(s) of ascended gear (which is the highest stat gear you can get).
---
Let me know if that wasn't really clear or you want more specifics
---
That would just make all the other mounts redundant...
---
My current holo build which I use for fractals is sword/shield with a grenade kit as the only extra kit. 
---
What about a child saying "is that your face?", it always cracked me up 
---
Please tell me that dialogue is still in
---
just bad 
---
I'd love this, too, but I think Anet is really trying to maintain a clean UI in GW2. 
---
That's likely the reason they totally CRAMMED the novelty and mount UI on the kill bar.
---
Haha
---
Yes, you can, the only restriction is it can't be one of the second generation legendaries tied to collections. So Shooshadoo, HMS Divinity, Eureka, Shining Blade, Ipos and so on.
---
Isn't that what Legendaries do? 
---
&gt; How do I begin this process? (Never crafted before so I am not sure how it works at all)
---
gw2crafts.com
---
&gt; What does it require outside of materials and time?
---
? Nothing, besides Gold for materials you dont have
---
&gt; Can I do it on any character, or is it better to do it on my level 80?
---
Crafting is actually a pretty good way to level up, but for your first crafting I would wait for level 80, simply because you need a lot of materials to get from crafting level 1-400 (or 1-500 depending on what crafting you're doing), which you can gather while you level up. 
---
&gt; Is it possible to do multiple crafting skills at once?
---
You can have two on one character, which should be enough. I purchased myself something from the gemstore which gives my characters the ability to learn three different crafts and I rarely use it.
---
&gt; Does it make sense to have multiple crafting disciplines on one character or spread them out?
---
Of course it does. Say you have a Thief, you can learn Leatherworker and Weaponsmith so you can craft both your Armor and some Weapons for yourself, like Daggers and such. No need to change characters, unless you want a Pistol for your Thief (then you also need Huntsman, but this can be just crafted from another character).
---
0/10 for making a post like this on /r/guildwars2 instead of /r/GuildWarsDyeJob as well as using an outfit 
---
This was a nightmare world we had come into
---
Low value post? You're kidding, right?
---
As many others have said, firebrand is probably closest thing to pally, thematically. (Can be spec'd to me somewhat of a melee healer, heavy armor, etc.)
---
Necromancer may be a good choice, too. Support scourge (PoF specialization for necro) is really strong if you do want to heal/support in endgame group content. As you level it, you may like the tanky playstyle and skills that come from the blood trait line (traits are like WoW talents). Necros have a lot of self-sustain, and I like wells for AOE damage and support. It's a light armor class but very hearty due to large health pool and its shroud form which has a second health pool called life force.
---
and who is that?
---
Or Angelfire.
---
I saw a support player go totally toxic in TD map chat one day.  They'd brought baggage from some other game in with them, expected "healers" to get preferential treatment, and couldn't understand why they weren't being rezzed immediately during the meta.
---
True to form the community did their best to explain to this grumpypants the fact that open world content is designed to be completed without support classes, but... they just weren't hearing it.
---

I was so broke I couldn't waypoint out of the map I was on once.  I doubt it'll ever happen again, but it's a thing that *has* happened.
---
Variety of currencies from dungeons that give the stat combo gear you want. There's a table [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Equipment_acquisition_by_stats#Dungeons) that shows which dungeons overlap for what stat combos.
---
Most Spitfires in DS.  Which is was where I was told that player corpses scale content.
---
So based on this, Citadel, Crucible and Arah are the ones I need--does that mean I should run them multiple times a day and buy pieces as I earn enough currency? Is there a "lock-out" timer mechanic in this game or can dungeons be chain runned to farm the currencies? 
---
[You were inspired by this, weren't you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/acw9f9/presenting_the_ffxivminionoutfits_album_a/)
---
Nothing wrong with that I guess but the timing is just a bit too perfect.
---
tho HoT on release was lacking by the end it did turn out pretty good, both expansions have a different feel over all, which is fantastic really, they are ment to give different experiences and they do so not just in design but feel aswell
---
im honestly curious were the next one will take us design wise now that we have two that are very different, will it follow PoF or be a third entirely new feeling experience
---
Just to expand / be pedantic (I don't disagree):
---
&gt; sPvP doesn't have them 
---
The Guild Lords on Legacy of the Foefire and the lords on Battle of Champion's Dusk do.
---
&gt; only lords have them in WvW 
---
Players also have them if they are holding a Turtle Banner, Dragon Banner, or Centaur Banner.
---
Eh, I still have legit criticisms with PoF. 
---
The PoF maps events were clearly rushed, they reused a lot of assets in metas and just sized up enemy models, the rewards were and still are badly tuned, the event timers are out of whack compared to everything else in the game, the metas have severe culling issues, and the maps just don't have much replay value in general. 
---
One last criticism: Elegy Mosaics are also a useless currency if you aren't going for Funerary weapon skins or Gift of Desert Mastery. And the latter is a much bigger pain in the ass than Gift of Maguuma Mastery because Funerary Incense have much the same material requirements (Amalgamated Gemstone, Obbi Shard, Ecto), but they are *timegated* by 13 days for a stack, for what seems to be no reason.
---
Yeah, sorry to rain on your parade. But PoF really needs an expansion 2.0. polishing update, much like HoT once had.
---
At least the story is pretty good. 
---
Toe to tip, that's a Bart!

Yep I redid this puzzle for a couple months (i'd try a couple times a week) just to try again on the damn dive.  The puzzle wasn't even the hard part anymore.  
---
Finally after watching youtube videos over and over again to see positioning I eventually got it.  Never again.
---
As someone who's ran around leveling toons, I'll go through my bank and pull out any tomes I have, and all the experience boosters, as well as cheap foods and utilities that offer bonus xp. A lot of the boosters have up to 100% bonus experience from kills, so I'll run around a map collecting way points, doing events, and killing everything along the way, especially the yellow named ambient creatures. Creatures that haven't been killed in a while offer extra experience, and combined with my boosters, food, and anything else, I can get 6-7k off a single creature. Keep yourself in areas that are at your current level, and move when you start getting downscaled. It's a good way to open up a bunch of the map and learn to play a new toon if you're lacking on tomes. 
---
I'll also fully complete the cities for extra xp and charges for fashion wars.
---
Hyperbole.
---
I think I got Stockholm Syndrome because I really like it. Spent so much time getting these goggles...I still have a character parked there, if anybody needs the legendary collection thingy or the goggles and has tp to friend, PM me :'D (EU Server) 
---
I'm about level 42, and I'm just starting to get fatigued of map completion as a means of leveling. I was hoping that dungeons would be a savior to offer something to break it up, but the story versions are too difficult for me to solo and a few hours in LFG didn't get any results.
---
Is it pretty much a single player experience until level 80? That'd be a little depressing if so. Especially given how many skill slots I have to fill on things to make traversing the world less of a chore, so I don't really get to play with many combat skills.
---
I can only assume you died of cardiac arrest, judging by that picture.
---
I think the main thing for a tempest rework is to swap the aura share trait in water with the aura heal trait in tempest.  
---
Let tempest share auras and water heal on auras.  
---
This will let tempest share offensive auras (with fire/air/tempest) and will let core ele use auras for sustain.  
---
  
---
On top of that:
---
&gt;* Minor Proficiency: Warhorn Proficiency - You can wield the warhorn weapon.  
---
&gt;* Minor Adept: Singularity - Attain elemental singularity by remaining in an attunement for a period of time. Upon attaining singularity, you may overload the attunement to your vicinity.  
---
&gt; * Major Adept: Gale Song - Trigger "Eye of the Storm!" when a foe attempts to control you by stun, daze, knockback, pull, knockdown, sink, float, fear, taunt, or launch.  
---
&gt; * Major Adept: Effective Conduit - Using skills from an attunement reduces the recharge of its overload.  
---
&gt; * Major Adept: Unstable Conduit - Overloading an attunement grants an aura based on the element you're attuned to when the ability is completed.  
---
&gt;* Minor Master: Speedy Conduit - Gain swiftness when overloading an attunement.  
---
&gt; * Major Master: Tempestuous Aria - Allies affected by your shouts gain a boom and Enemies are affected by a condition based on shout. Shouts have reduced CD.  
---
&gt; * Major Master: Elemental Bastion - Auras you apply heal allies.   
---
&gt; * Major Master: Harmonious Conduit -	Gain stability when beginning an overload. Upon successfully completing an overload, gain a buff based on overload (fire 5% dmg and condi dmg, air 10% crit dmg, earth -10% dmg  and condi dmg reduction, water 10% healing effectiveness) for a period of time.  
---
&gt;* Minor Grandmaster: Hardy Conduit - Gain protection and barrier while overloading an attunement.  
---
&gt; * Major Grandmaster: Imbued Melodies - Gain increased concentration when wielding a warhorn. Use Sand Squall when struck while below the health threshold.  
---
&gt; * Major Grandmaster: Lucid Singularity - Remove and gain massive resistance to movement-impeding conditions while overloading your attunements.  
---
&gt; * Major Grandmaster: Tempestuous Auras - When you apply an aura to yourself, apply the same aura to 10 allies.  
---
I don't believe you're going to get a ton of support for this sentiment on reddit. While PoF favors open exploration and ease of getting around and getting masteries done, as well as getting hero points done with a smaller/solo group, there are a number of people for a number of reasons who prefer HoT.
---
Some of us prefer the complexity of the HOT zones, which are brilliant designed. Some of us prefer the difficulty of HoT where I actually feel like I'm in danger much of the time. Many of us prefer the big organized metas that provide rewards that actually make doing the worthwhile. 
---
HoT metas are better, to me anyway, than bounties in PoF. 
---
The one thing PoF absolutely has going for it is the mounts.  For everything else, I'll take HoT over PoF and on that note, gliding is no slouch either.
---
I think in general PoF appealed to a more casual crowd and HoT in general appealed to a harder core crowd. Obviously this is a vast generalization.  I think the next expansion need to borrow from what made HoT and PoF successful.
---
Exaggerate much, they weren't 'incredibly vile and disreputable', especially Fries.
---
I'm gonna have nightmares. Thank you. 
---
Can you clarify a bit? What do you mean by 2 different skills? Would you recommend any builds that could encapsulate the above? Berserker stats I am assuming?
---
It borders on out of control good sometimes I log on my ranger just to run around and one shot things for the lulz
---
Would you recommend any builds that could encapsulate the above? Berserker stats I am assuming? I noticed spellbreaker is a lot about buffs?
---
it's one of those circlejerk reddit things where if you repeat something enough it becomes gospel..like necro having amazing survivability, thief being very hard to play in pve etc.
---
it's nonsense of course, you learn literally nothing from using a crippled build with probably wrong gear choices while fighting arguably easy enemies(as story is and should be)
---
it's some imaginary tutorial that's supposed to prepare you but it ends up teaching bad habits while your wasting time
---
you can see it too in basically any open world event, people just pressing every button available cuz that's what they "learned" from leveling up
---
Asura monitors has low refresh rate obviously:-P
---
You can craft it a second time.  The stuff you got from collections can be purchased from Hobbs in Lion's Arch.  You just craft the 1st tier precursor up through The Mechanism then buy Gift of the Cosmos from him.  Done.  I have zero idea why people are saying you can't craft it multiple times.
---
I don‚Äòt play that game ... I was making an Lavi (D. gray-man) inspired character (-&gt; orange scarf, black coat) and searched for a matching mini afterwards :)
---
How so?  You can buy the collection chests from Hobbs in Lion's Arch and craft the precursor again.  After that he also says the 4th tier gift, in this case Gift of the Cosmos, and then you just get Mystic Tribute, Gift of Maguuma Mastery and use Cosmos for Gift of Astralaria.
---
HoT is widely regarded as easier/more solo player friendly. Really "challenging" isn't the right word. You won't have any problems if you have spent some time getting familiar with combat and your character in general.
---
I can't really chime in on webcams. I'd assume most people go for whatever HD webcam they can afford. Or just anything that has good reviews on amazon.
---
As for mics, the Blue snowball or Yeti are fairly popular among streamers and youtubers. They're USB, easy to setup and don't tend to break the bank for the quality.
---
If you want quality though, you will have to pay out for it. 
---
Noooo, how do I match Scarlett?!
---
Holo mode and ... infusion? (I just own holo-scarlett).

It's below you on the land-level in a cave with fleshreavers.  Slightly to the southeast of your location is the path in if I remember correctly and it should be a channel.

Why are botters / wvw cheaters / pvp wintraders still running around unbanned if they actually ban people? Surely they have more than enough evidence given that some of them have been going unpunished for months, even years at a time. 
---
Before going into that, let‚Äôs ensure your CPU is even up the the task of running and streaming GW2 at the same time, as GW2 hogs the CPU and likes to let you drop frames while streaming. 
---
Which gathering tools should I be using?
---
Events are usually where it's at. For both people and more experience. They are those orange things that pop up on the minimap. 
---
Creepy looking characters.
---
Not sure which one is mini though...
---
Elementalist - played a few classes so far and I realised that elementalist is the only class that does wide range aoe burst damage. I'm not referring to cleave, I'm referring to being able to deal huge damage to enemies that are spread out in a wide area. The drawback is their squishiness.
---
That is probably why they rushed it, lel. See y'all at tuesday. 
---
You want good stuff but it has to be cheap? Yeah OK...
---
Can you replay the first story chapter on the same character to get all the collections for Raise the Banners: Amnoon Arbitrator, or can you only do one per character?
---
of.
---
I'll bite here, what's the attack?
---
&gt;But whatever, you aren't taken seriously for a reason.
---
This?, lmao.
---
I just checked my old twitch and I have a VOD from when I made my first legendary in 2013, has the old LA and everything in it. My gear was so hideous back then but we had no wardrobe system so it was extremely impractical and unintuitive to work with the transmutation crystals. The trading post also looked SOOO much different.

It‚Äôs a fun little gizmo to use here and then and gets you to the platform too
---
Are you f2p or do you have expansions? Do you have any level boosts available? If so, you could consider using one. It isn't recommended for a first character, but it is possible to just learn everything at 80. 
---
I am going to be pretty brutally honest next. Gw2 is very tailored to a single player experience. There are group play options like fractals and raids and pvp, but the majority of the game's content is balanced for the individual player. For example, loot and experienced are earned from just hitting a mob, you don't have to hit it first or last or do the majority of the damage. Gathering nodes are all individual based and no one can steal your nodes. Events are tailored and scaled so that basically everyone gets to get full credit from them. The game mostly doesn't force you to group up with anyone. It's kind of like a single player game that other player are also in. This may not be your kind of game. I for one love it as I have to rely on random other people as little as possible, and only really when I specifically am doing content that I am looking for that kind of gameplay on. It is also possible to exclusively play group content at Max level, but a hardcore raider with likely run out of content, and a hardcore pvper will probably feel like their content is neglected. 
---
Now advice for you. It may be that the character that you are playing isn't for you, or maybe you should change up your build. If you are playing a greatsword warrior, try out sword/sword condition damage warrior or something else radically different. You also may be focussing on the wrong content. A lot of people find the hearts to be pretty boring, so finding event chains may be better. Also, keep in mind that experience is scaled to your level, so you can level in lower level zones and will only get a slight penalty. You could also try spvp. You can get tomes of knowledge that give you 1 character level per. You get them pretty often. Your character is set to level 80 in spvp so won't be at a disadvantage in level or gear (normalized), though if you don't have expansions the elite specs are very strong.
---
&gt; - "Eye Of The Storm!": In addition to its previous effects, this skill now also grants Shocking Aura), so that it gains the same aura-providing utility like its counterparts.
---
Absolutely no way. There's a reason why it doesn't give a shocking aura. That would be sooo damn stupid in PvP, especially since that shout already has a trait activation and Tempest are already in a good spot (2nd best support after Firebrand).
---
&gt; After reporting it, what else to do? Pray?
---
Play!
---
YES! For things like silverwaste shovels :p 
---
Bahaha I love that answer x)
---
How do you know they didnt receive temporary bans?
---
In addition to what everyone else is saying, make alts and leveling them up is much easier in gw2 compared to other MMOs. I had the same concerns as well but then just made other classes .
