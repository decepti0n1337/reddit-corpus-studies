Well yes, you can do that, but I'd still suggest a training guild/discord. Those usually have no li requirements and the explanations are done in voice by knowledgeable people.
---

---
You can also think that as a way to get yourself more experience leading and organising groups. The training guild I am still in allows anyone to gather and command groups, there are experienced leaders ready to advice and mentors to help with classes. 
---
---
---
Ofc not, first you should ask reddit for help. Read the post, he never heard of arenanet, and the message isnt even shown in his messages. Only in mine as in sent from his number.
---
Could someone be using my number deliberatly? Is there anyway someone could gain smth by this? 
---
Oh yeah. Worth 2000g
---
they're called sylvari you racist
---
1. Asura PS proclaims that magic is finite. Until we have reason to believe otherwise, that's correct. 
---
2. This is 100% confirmed through things like The All and Omadd's Machine. There are six, no more , no less. Granted, there might have been more or less in the past, but as of the game's beginning, there be six.
---
3. While it's unclear if the Elder Dragons ever managed to devour every single scrap (it's unlikely since no magic = world dead just as much as too much magic = world dead), they do aim to devour all magic while awake, among doing other things. 100% confirmed.
---
4. Elder Dragons do indeed go to sleep when there's no more magic for them to consume. And they do indeed release magic as they sleep. This has been 100% confirmed.
---
5. And 6. as well, are conclusions of points 1, 3, and 4. And this conclusion is the logical deduction and restatement thus as long as points 1, 3, and 4 are correct, points 5 and 6 are correct. So surmising that the asura PS was not a red herring about the finite amount of magic, then they are 100% confirmed.
---
Not sure where the "not enough information" lies.
---
They didn't add more magic to Tyria. Their "gift of magic" was just releasing some magic that was stored in the Bloodstone, which in turn was taken from the world itself to prevent the Elder Dragons from consuming it.
---
The only time magic got added would be Abaddon's death, but that was a temporary thing as Kormir took it all in within minutes (not fast enough to prevent Primordus' awakening mind you).
---
**Daaayuummmm**
---
With a friend to carry you through the first pof mission, you can unlock the raptor with a low level character and save the boost for later. 
---
Everyone can edit the Wiki. Don't be afraid of doing it wrong, if your edit can be improved somebody will do that in the near future. 
---
The gift of magic that Abaddon and the other gods granted were just releasing power from the Bloodstone among certain groups.
---
And while souls are a source of energy, I wouldn't be so quick as to call this source of energy \*magic\*.
---
Yes, though point 6 is really just repeating 5 which is just a conclusion of 1, 3, and 4...
---
Regarding to why there are six, that seems to just be how The All sets up. Keep in mind that the Elder Dragons don't only balance magic, but The All itself, and The All is made up primarily of 7 parts: Tyria and six "[spirit realms](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hidden_Arcana#At_the_Durmand_Priory)" or "spheres of influence and powerful magic", and the Elder Dragons are connected to those (as are some stars), making up the other six spheres.
---
One theory I had at one point was that the six spheres might be the afterlives. Though like trying to relate the dragons to the Six Gods, the lineup falls short fast.
---
I forgot about the Elder Races and Bloodstones, they exist before the Gods arrived with human, right?
---
So this is what trolls write, when they are revealed?
---
I wonder when you recognize how ridiculous your answers are. Well, sometime you will grow up and learn it.
---
make one with long hair so it can look like me.
---
I thought thirsty thursday was yesterday &gt;\_&gt;
---
Black lion weapons.  You can buy them off the TP as well.
---
i believe you read too much into how the different "factions" interact, the way they fight or not is probably the result not the reason..maybe that was a workaround when season 1 occured since the game was still young and all that but i doubt it's the case nowadays
---
most unwanted interactions are controlled by invulnerability or just coding a certain script into the behaviour
---
i think it's mostly just anet's inconsistency..what do you mean by arkk getting attacked by scarlet minions?
---
Dhuum didn't die because he can't die.  He is merely being contained.
---
**GW2Browser** is still the best source, it allows your to browse through the game files, and from there you can extract the model, I used it myself at times \^\^
---
venom rework would be nice so that it would be viable on fights with adds  
---
I did a little bit of farming around the North West part of the Iron Marches killing a whole bunch of Flame Legion soldiers that drop medium loot bags. These tend to have linen and rugged leather sections, which gives the bag a sort of decent price. Not really a great way to make profit at all compared to other farming methods.
---
Even farming different maps for events to get the map rewards would be more profitable. Moral of the story: the more engaging activities in the game tend to be the most profitable.
---
Yes, I completely agree with you. I've played all story instances on a female human and no offense meant to the VA but it's just terrible. Particularly the lack of emotion and that bloody breathing everytime she starts a sentence. It's slightly better now but I don't know how the devs let it pass for so many years. 
---
To be honest, it does affect how immersed I am in the story, unfortunately.
---
not everything has to make perfect sense and fit together, it's called having options
---
you even answered yourself..
---
"why would necro wanna melee?"
---
"dagger is melee"
---
hmmmm...
---
staff is meta in pvp and wvw and has been since forever? 2/3 game modes meta for 6-7years or something..yea pretty useless indeed
---
i won't argue the rest of the points you made because they aren't real points
---
Okay, I figured that would be the case. I wasn't sure if some of the older groups were much different outside of culture (I know more GW2 than GW atm, though I expect those roles to reverse during this project).
---
So the standard GW2 Era of races being playable. I'm also looking at a few expanded where possible, such as the bird people.
---
You can use this build and it will probably be half decent too in open world content. In content like fractals though it probably wouldn't be too great considering condi already struggles in most instances and i'm sure thief isn't the strongest condi class. I also recommend using shortbow as weapon swap since it has decent condi damage at range if you plan on using this build, though you will sacrifice a good bit of damage, especially since this build is probably riding on the trait Dagger Training for its success. However, some fights can be annoying to fight melee in so it's always a nice option.
---
Hmm, interesting! I've not focused much on gods in either game, but this feels right given how little there seems to be. Thank you for reminding me of this.
---
Because when the world needed Them the most, they vanished.
---
Since the firing of Jessica Price and Peter Fries, there has been a noticeable lack of Anet interactions on Reddit.  In fact some of them have deleted their accounts. I suspect that trend will continue. 
---
The amount of times Mordremoth's been broken early (by level 80s no less) speaks to the fact that a surprising amount of players cannot correctly identify cc. You just don't have to learn in PvE zergs, and people fall through the cracks.
---
Lmao! It will just be proof you did it first üòè
---
Considering most other games I've played the main character was barely even using their voice and most of the time just nodded/shook their head while NPCs talk to them, I'd take nearly anything over that. I would prefer the breaths in between sentences not there but as far as the voice itself I find it to be pretty solid. Very assertive and fitting for someone leading a team.
---
I don't use it, but I believe you should place the .dll inside your bin64 folder.
---
Haha another of this question.
---
Tis alright. If you play Tera, you'll find this game similar when action cam is on but much fluid in animation (Tera attack animations are cooler tho).
---
It's a fact, but given how this is the internet, and against subreddit rules for GW2 sub I'm not going to just post all my personal info online. That's just asking for identity theft. While not necessarily directly pertinent to the matter at hand, I most assuredly have shown greater understanding of structured debate up to this point. While you have only ignored what you can't answer and deflect with cheap insults resorting to ad hominem, with "you must have been very bad there" and such.
---
I've had this happen before but they don't do anything and go away after a map change
---
Well the main character doesnt become a god for a reason...
---
Unless the game ends and heads unto GW3, Only then can we become a god...
---
But like Gw1, the hero there didnt become a god
---
We can turn into Demi-gods, God Slayers have access to godlike powers which are needed to slay gods/dragons, Creatures tied to creation itself.
---
But I dont think we will turn into gods we rather let someone else take the (Fall) Godhood cause they deserve it more
---
Never had to group up for story, if anything the story quests are too fire-and-forget for my taste in some cases. If you can deal damage mindlessly it is enough for solo instances as they are designed to be super easy, the story itself is what matters, not the challenge. Other than that, PoF is significantly more straightforward compared to HoT, and even HoT has many players still roaming the maps to this day, as group challenge is the entire motif of those maps. Core maps are a bore and too many mmos forget to actually include the "mmo" part in the open world.
---
Google gw2 event timer, run Istan for an hour when Palawadan is up, buy T6 lootchests you get about 30g/h.
---
Do CM + T4 / recs fractals each day for about 60g/h.
---
If you're chilled you can make ~100g a day while only playing like two hours or so.
---
Even if you play bad and can't T4 you can allways run Palawadan and Great Hall etc.
---
While playing GW2, you might think of these aspects..
---
TERA: Tera has amazing skill animations and true class trinity. Gw2 combo autoattack looks alright but really lacks the uumph that TERA has, esp in critical number dmg and combos. Class trinity is great in hard content as it distributes duty and people with dedicated roles. Gw2 is nice that any class can do DPS role (obv there are the ones that stand out the most) but since this is the case, there are people who play half assed roles and fight over roles at times.
---
ESO: Skill evolution will be missed. Games like BnS, C9, BDO like ESO has skill evolution by either investing more points on them which makes builds very interesting. Gw2 has very limited builds to be frank, we do however have elite specializations which can alter core skills but this is not nearly enough for skill diversity unlike it's predecessor Gw1.
---
WARFRAME: Unique weapon upgrades will be missed. Similar to skill evolution, the perks on the upgrades are significant and really fun to tweak and shows a sense of horizontal progression. Gw2 caps really easily and even with infusion stacked, the upgrade seem very futile and gold dump vs epicness factor is very lacking.
---
WoW: true hard core community will be missed. Toxic sure but I do miss people playing game a lil more seriously at times. If they came to play the hardest content, they ought to come prepared. Well, that's like less than 5% of this community filled with casuals. Tis nice if you're within the 5% and make a name for yourself so people want to team up with you but you'll also cap in rewards weekly and for the rest of the week, it's hard to find people of the same level of interest aka half assed raiders.
---
Then what keeps me playing this game? Nicer people, not feel like losing much progression even after a long hiatus, fashion wars is prolly one of the best in MMO history.
---
All are my subjective opinion but you might be able to relate because I did play all the games you mentioned :) welcome to gw2 regardless.
---
I myself have a question related to this. The Elder Dragons are basically a force to maintain the balance of magic in the world. Therefore wouldn't killing them be bad because then the flow of magic is disrupted? They eventually go back to sleep (aka thousands of years later) so why not just deal with it and accept the fact that Elder Dragons are part of maintaining the magic levels? Not trolling or trying to be rude, serious question.
---
&gt;Despite the Crystal Sea boiling of the battle, no wild energy was released that really disturbed the magical balance of Tyria. Additional side note to the side note, no Elder Dragons were in close proximity to the Crystal Sea/Desert at that time, as closest being Zhaitan in Orr.
---
As you mentioned before, Abaddon weren't killed there. So it's was not like his second fight or when Balthazar died. They destroyed a whole sea, but there were no disruption in the magic.
---
&gt;Lastly, Dhuum's defeat. Same as in the case of Abaddon, during the fight there was no magical chaos, but when Dhuum was defeated, there was no haywire magic like in Abaddon's case, and oddly the fight took place literally above Zhaitan's slumber in Orr which didn't affect it in any way.
---
‚Äã
---
&gt;So what was the difference? Why didn't magic go haywire in Dhuum's downfall compared to Abaddon's? Was it that Grenth after outright stripping Dhuum of his powers imprisoned him instead of killing him? Abaddon straight up died in Nightfall.
---
I think that's the case. Grenth only "took" Dhuums magic and imprisoned him, just like Balthazar took Primordus and Jormags magic in LS3. 
---
&gt;Also: Which beings on Tyria are capable of absorbing magic of that scale? Kormir was a simple human when she absorbed the full powers of Abaddon. During the side story where we forge the Shadowstone, we learn that we as the commander, were exposed too much to ley energy to the point where we experience hallucinations.
---
Kormir was able to become a god, because of the other gods. They offered her this way and she had to choose. 
---
If we look at Humans in GW2, we see that they can't contain too much magic. Humans and other creatures became crazed by Ley Line magic. Matthias became an abomination by consuming too much Bloodstone magic. Xera on the other hand used bloodstones and their magic, but didn't consumed it. 
---
I think it's the same for all other races. Sylvaris could be an exception, since they are dragon minions and we know that other dragon minions can consume magic.
---
&gt;So, instead of having a dragon to contain the powers of Kralkatorrik, why not just straight up become a god like Kormir? I know its a blunt question, but this is really a bit itchy from certain standpoints.
---
We know Kormir was able to become a god because of the other gods. Bot the gods are gone. Also that's Elder Dragons and no gods. I mean helping to become a god is a bit different to helping to become an Elder Dragon. 
---
We don't even know if a god could contain an Elder Dragons magic. We know that Balthazar absorbed a Bloodstone and a big part of Jormags and Primordus magic, but we also know that the other gods took away his god magic (like Grenth did with Dhuum), so the "container" named Balthazar was almost empty, when Rytlock freed him. We don't know if Bloodstone + Jormag/Primordus boost **+** Balthazars original magic would fit into his body. 
---
Just one things needs to be explained hard!
---
Every ability with the power to destroy break bars
---
Those big blue bars on enemies needs to be destroyed with CC
---
Stun/taunts/roots/fears unleash it all to destroy that bar plz!
---
thank you for reading kind sire/madam may you be blessed with luck!
---
By providing the source for that information, I would put myself and identity at risk for basically no reason other than to spite you, why would I do that? But like I said it's not really pertinent to GW2 or Mordremoth at hand so, yeah just disregard it since that is all you can do anyway. While I have insulted your character I have re-iterated my points about western designs of dragons making more sense due to Arenanet being a western studio several times over with no rebuke from you on any of those arguments. That is the core. I can insult your character all I want because my points made about the game and Mordremoth's design don't rely on ad hominem to try to appear credible. You offer nothing of relevant value to try to discredit those key points. So yeah, I'm gonna throw some shade at you while still holding the initiative for a proven argument.
---
What‚Äôs the last day to enter 
---
GW1 in general had atrocious dialogue and VA lol. I love Shiro in concept, but damn tat last scene is hilarious.
---
What I like about FFXIV's Stormblood is that it not only borrows a lot from Japa from Doma, but also a lot of Thai and Hindu cultures as well as some neat Indonesian and Thai references.
---
I don't hate on Western European fantasy, a lot of good Germanic and Celtic fantasy is great; it's just that it's mired down in a ton of low quality generic English cultural repetition. So I can afford to enjoy Middle Eastern and Asian takes a lot more since it's lesser quantity and thus less likely to be derivative.
---
I do wish at some point we saw some more fantasy settings with Eastern European/Eurasian mythology, because people underestimate just how much ethnic diversity Russia alone has let alone surrounding regions and slavic culture in general just gets completely overshadowed.
---
No no no. Being proud of your heritage isn't a political agenda. However, shoving it down our throats while making good, honest people out to be the "white devil" is very much so an agenda. Which is why I absolutely despise "black history month", because it's no longer about celebrating African American heritage and freedoms, it's about putting white people down for shit that happened generations ago.
---
His whole modern day Black Panther (not the movie) bullshit has people like MLK and Rosa Parks rolling in their graves.

There's really no restriction.

I count the highest vote moments before the winner is announced. So you have till Tuesday 2/26 9PM EST.

Core necro doesn't get GS. 
---
That aside, GS and Dagger generate the same amount per chain, but the Dagger chain takes 2.04s and the GS chain takes 2.88s, which is about 40% longer, so yeah. Good news is they both generate 8% life force per chain.
---
Because Elder Dragons kill/corrupt everything else while they're awake. 
---
I do feel like both Finno-Ugric and Slavic mythology have a lot of potential for really interesting fantasy settings. I fundamentally like fantasy as a genre and I don't think Germanic/Celtic fantasy is impossible to do well, but a lot of fantasy in that vein has become an extreme ouroboros. Sometimes people can create really interesting Germanic/Celtic based settings just by actually going back to the historical record and not relying on circular references to other fantasy (especially when it comes to social systems/belief/real world political practice/contact with other cultures/syncretism). 
---
Where Elona really interested me and got me on-side was the way it mashed up different elements; each of the nations visually and culturally references a bunch of different places (unified mostly by climate, which is a really interesting way to do it), and I actually think Cantha has moments of that same ingenuity. I mean the Kurzicks are this bizarre nod to Japanese gothic lolita combined with Padme-Amidala-esque references to Manchu traditional make-up combined with their explicitly gothic naming conventions. The Luxons likewise are one of the most interesting visual concepts I've seen in fantasy for a while, I've been doodling siege turtles ever since.
---
This doesn't work. There are guilds that I've experienced where it's laid back and no pressure in t4 fractals and raids, but the diffetence is, there is a level of expectation, such as at least having a meta build and a semi solid team comp. Personal skill didn't matter as long as you somewhat did your job. What you're describing is good on paper, but not practical in any way shape or form. No one, not even the most casual players like to die over and over again for hours on 1 boss or fractal level. This requires some form of organisation or actual meta builds to accomplish. If you have a full 10 man team of everyone with random gear and "fun" builds, you'll get nowhere in upper end game content. 
---
Captain Grumby doesn't need any "saying the right words" or "weakening them enough" or even magical peach trees nurtured by a mute druid/nature spirit. Which is why I'm pointing him out.
---
The peach tree seems a bit special, itself being magical and capable of calming the ghosts. But Grumby's the only ghost we see that is confirmed killed on the Ring of Fire Bloodstone, and he alone is never crazed without external forces un-crazing.
---
there's generally some March sales that go on. Take a look at their [retailer list](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/) to see if you can't find a sale on one of their registered retailers
---
&gt;I'm not sure how to look for them, as what I'm searching for is neither really casual, nor it's truly hardcore, but some middle-ground 
---
There definitely are guilds in the middle ground. But considering how many times you said you wanted to avoid effective builds, raids and high tier fractals are off limits. You're definitely looking for a fully casual guild.
---
Casual builds  - High end content
---
Pick one, not both.
---
If you ever can‚Äôt find something on wiki, I would suggest typing ‚Äúgw2 wiki *insert item you are looking for*‚Äù

I find that wiki is sometimes a little difficult to navigate, because if you don‚Äôt have the spelling right in the search bar it sometimes doesn‚Äôt show what you are looking for. It‚Äôs also time consuming to find it by surfing through the categories of the home page, but google is excellent at navigating through gw2 wiki.
---
So more devs can get fired?
---
You‚Äôll have to buy both unfortunately. They‚Äôre relatively inexpensive, and are fairly likely to go on sale mid to late March for the spring sale.
---
Only if it stays the same size! =D &lt;3
---
Also why don't the time trials count towards the achievement for the scarf? :?
---
Well, I can without a doubt in my mind say: you are incredibly egotistical.
---
&gt;because FIRST I didn't say anything bad about white people
---
&gt;How am I 'shoving it down people's throats'? This is the first thread I've even made on this particular subreddit
---
&gt;about a black person getting his black character drawn and just wanting to share and be happy because they have something they can relate too in a game that makes them feel equal..
---
You seem to think this whole thing is about you in specific. When in reality, compared to what this is ACTUALLY about, you're an insignificant part of a much greater whole that pollutes the system. The fact that you think this entire thing is about you and that I have to actually explain that it ISN'T about you speaks volumes about your character.
---
I'm not "getting defensive" that a black person is happy about a commission they had done; I'm not mad that you're posting your commission. Pull your head out of your ass and stop thinking the world revolves around you.
---
This is about the whole "black history month" nonsense you posted, then continued to engage in. You could have just as easily left the whole "Happy Hate White People Month" off your post and no one would be having this pointless argument. I wouldn't even be talking with you and I would have even upvoted your post because the art is fucking fantastic. But because race was brought into this with the "Happy Black History Month", here we are. Flinging our shit like the monkeys we came from.
---
Going on a complete guess here, but it may be that when you collected coins, they were actually put on a very long cooldown for you (think years-long) which just happened to end, and now they're interactive again. Cooldown like the one you get on mining nodes, chests, etc, all the "gadgets", except for those it lasts only for a few hours instead of years. Could be that whoever designed the coin gadgets put an arbitrary number of "1000 days" or so as cooldown.
---
Some time after HoT release I started noticing various heart-related gadgets being interactive again for the character I did world completion on back in 2012-2013. Could be the same issue. Except back then I thought devs just made them interactive outside of hearts because certain legendary weapon collections required interacting with them [citation needed], so to avoid the hassle they just went and changed them globally.
---
Nothing new, just to say that they're right, you don't have to do anything for the event to spawn and your instance isn't okay. I also had to do it not too long ago for Nevermore. Good luck.
---
The reason I started optimizing my play is because I found playing in casual guilds to be a wildly inconsistent and frustrating experience.  I think non-meta is generalle find if you can consistently cover your bases, but it's like a house of cards.  As soon as someone complains or is unable to adapt or swap roles boon &amp; buff coverage falls apart.  You can run off-meta or non-standard compositions, but you need to be prepared to go into things expecting to struggle and take much longer to do things. 
---
Hey guys, I've bee logging in casually for awhile because I haven't had time to play the game. I have been trying to make sure I log in to get the newest Living Story episode each time, but I'm not sure if I have. Is there some way to tell?

Not sure about Ember Bay but Istan is great for Karma farm.

&gt; The level of interest in the Unending Ocean is very surprising to me. I thought I was the only one. I think a proper exploration of it would require a reexamination of underwater combat, but that's a risky proposition. A bunch of time and development resources put towards something that may not be well received.
---
The obvious thing to do is to create a Living World Season 5 map which is almost completely underwater. Bring back the largos, throw in some quaggan and krait, expand the deep sea dragon's lore and introduce the game's first underwater mount. Really invest heavily into thinking about what exactly can make underwater content in GW2 feel good, do some things similar to what Black Desert Online has done with Margoria and it's water content (GW2's skimmers and water combat would be a lot of fun in BDO's water content).
---
A single season's episode isn't a huge sacrifice to make to test the waters to see how water content received by the players. If nothing else it would be a breath of fresh air to have a map which is radically different from all others, and bringing an underwater mount to the game would be hugely appreciated by people who still do underwater content. If it's treated a bit like HoT, they could even layer it with islands and have tiers of exploration (above water islands tier, water tier and a cave system). It would also give the skimmer a chance to truly shine, something which Living World maps do very poorly imo (Season 4 maps usually didn't utilize masteries well, Season 5 maps don't seem to do much of this either).
---
If the content is well received they can do an expansion with large amounts of ocean content. If nothing else, we get an underwater mount out of it and a nice change of scenery from yet another map on land.

&gt; The destruction of a god releases a good amount of Magic that flows into the world, as we know today, through the ley-Lines. Since either the Dragons lie on those ley-lines because of the magic or these ley-lines form or shift because of the elder dragons they will react to fluctuations within them as we could see through the Season 1 cinematic in which Scarlet drills into a ley-line below Lions arch to awaken Mordremoth or that the Magic spiked through the ley-lines which triggered Primordus to wake up.
---
Well, the destruction of a god without something to immediately absorb said god's power would destroy the entire world. Based on Abaddon's death (specifically the [storybook for Abaddon's Gate](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Night_Falls)). Unlike with the dragons, gods and former gods release their magic violently when killed. Even though Balthazar wasn't on par to a god anymore, the release of his magic still caused a tempest that immediately engulfed half of Vabbi before Kralkatorrik and Aurene ate that magic.
---
Abaddon's magic never got the chance to go through the ley-lines, as Kormir absorbed it all from the heart of the Realm of Torment. Primordus didn't receive any magic, unlike Mordremoth, but rather sensed the momentarily increased amount of magic due to the Realm of Torment being partially merged with Tyria by Abaddon's actions during Nightfall.
---
&gt; And if we look back at Balthazar then the argument of "Kralkatorrik absorbed Balthazars magic on his death" isn't quite right either because Balthazar wasn't a god anymore at that time and he replenished his magic from the Bloodstone explosion and the machine by syphoning Primordus and Jormag which initially is magic from Tyria.
---
Though it seems that ArenaNet is making it that, even as a former god, Balthazar altered the magic he absorbed into his own domain thus explaining the lack of utilizing ice magic at any point. Similarly, any magic the Elder Dragons absorb not from a fallen being connected to a domain of magic such as another Elder Dragon or (former) god would change that absorbed magic into their own domain, thus why we never got Zhaitan utilizing a bunch of ice, fire, air, or nature magic despite stealing a metric shitton of magic themed towards the gods from throughout Orr. Or why Primordus, despite ravaging asura lands, has no asura gate-like portal magic to utilize to further spread destroyers about.

Hello! I‚Äôve been looking for a new MMO to play and am looking at GW2. I‚Äôm a bit confused with the business model. Is it free to play, do I purchase the base game, or do I go straight to purchasing expansions? Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
---
Love his art style, normally I don't enjoy these look someone drew my char posts, but that looks smart. 
---
Why do you want to be bad on purpose and dragging down your group?
---
This achievement was insanely harder before getting gliding/mounts. And before thief‚Äôs even got staffs!
---
But it is, actually the most demanding game CPU-wise that I've played (GPU not so) beating even AC Origins and Odyssey. No idea about other MMOs cause I don't play those.
---
The thing is, it's extremely reliable on high single-core performance and can't utilize multiple cores efficiently, you might have one core maxed out while the others aren't doing much at times. The DX12 mod could be your best bet, it increases the overall CPU load but it should also let you utilize the potential of your hardware more.
---
So my 4 meter tall norn gets to merge with a giant ice wurm?
---
Buy it. Collections are a pain in the ass. 
---
I crafted Dawn, learned the lesson the hard way so now I'll only buy when it comes to Gen1 pre. Would be nice if the same can be done for Gen2 pre, but too bad.
---
Hello guys I help daily people who need JP chest, dive spot or precursor places. If you see me online, just whisp me or send a message. If I am not in middle of some event or so I can port your poor souls just from the waypoint.

---
pity you didnt know the easy way, you could save so many TPs .D
---
You're a leecher who wants others to play the game for them? Hit me up, I'm in a raid selling guild on EU, I bet we can offer you a good price for what you want
---
If you play at higher res than 1080 never use supersample you get a worst image quality due to blur.
---
No use of highest quantity limit with lowest quality : you get low fps with the worst quality.
---
Medium quantity + medium quality (high quality in normal open pve / spvp) is the way to go.
---
Yeah I looked at it out of interest. The only source they cite is an international student event in Rotterdam held in 2011 for which the website is now defunct. Safe to say this is a very flimsy source to say the whole of the Netherlands celebrates black history month. (Spoiler: we don't). Someone edited that wiki page with an agenda I guess.
---
Ever heard of a saying "there are no stupid questions"? Not everyone knows how the game works and this kind of attitude discourages people from even asking.
---
"Fun" is a buzzword. It is empty, pointless and subjective, you can use it wherever you want and I'm not going to bother arguing with it. The only solid characteristic there was "tryhard", and no, fractals aren't nearly "tryhard". 
---
&gt;but you only get trash parties because everyone with any amount of experience is in T4.
---
Wow wow wow, such elitism!  So, maybe, lower skill players that rush for t4 should be pushed back? If t3 isn't easy enough, maybe to t2? I mean, people are advocating for easy mode for raids, but somehow refuse to play easy mode for fractals, seeing it for a trash dump it is. 
---
&gt; garbage
---
See "fun". I'm pretty tired of this, tbh. First some people say something constructive about new fractals, their positive and negative sides, then mob starts yelling random emotion-filled words. Sigh.
---
&gt;Forgot about the Molten Boss rework where they replaced a cutscene with several minutes of running through trash mobs. Fun and engaging content right there.
---
Actually, they replaced it with two pretty distinct encounters with a nice possibility to skip for advanced players. But yeah, bring back the cutscene. Cutscenes, this is where the actual fun is. 
---
Or you have it the other way round. Yellow Blue Purple : Good Neutral Evil
---
This just shows you have never set foot on AC.
---
This was to me an even worse offense then answering mostly only fluff questions. As if it were planned. 
---
1440p no blur, supersample renders 1440p x 2 aka somewhere around 4k, this helps with the mess of Antialiasing (using reshade myself).
---
char model lowest quality = wvw(srsly this helps a lot even on my 2080ti)
---
whats the best way to get leather nowdays?
---
Not one of those downvoting, but I can see why. What the OP is looking for doesn't really exist, so basically it sounds like they are hoping that they'll find someone nice enough to carry them through end-game content.
---
When you look at their comment history it's even worse -- OP is a new player, and [actually posted about looking for a challenge.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a95kyr/challenging_and_interesting_pve_sort_of_is_it/) So, *now* it sounds like they want to engage in challenging content without actually bringing the right gear and build for the job (to a reasonable extent, since nobody is probably going to kick you for only being 90% meta).
---
Given all that, I'm not surprised everyone is downbombing the post. 
---
If AC refers to Ascalonian Catacombs then yes, I did that a while ago with a couple of friends but that is in no way relevant to this argument.
---
No need to be so hostile, if you think something is stupid then explain why instead of adding nothing to the discussion.
---
'Your plan is stupid and just won't work' is a quote from an NPC in Ascalonian Catacombs. Masuli was making a memey reply.
---
If you don't find such guild, did you consider making one? 
---
Pls report back how your project worked out ;)
---
Dungeons are fine, they're not quite as hard as fractals or raids, non-meta builds aren't really an issue there -- if anything, getting 5 people is more of a problem.
---
But high-level fractals and raids do require you to at least bring a build and gear that makes sense. OP can go full Soldier's gear on a dragonhunter for example and use a really weird build, but if it doesn't help the group then the group is just carrying OP. It's not that OP has to play a meta class with full meta gear and 100% benchmark DPS to be considered 'worthy', but they don't even seem inclined to even try. 
---
And that's 101 of group content: Your choice to play how you want ends where the group's tolerance ends, because it's 4 or 9 other people in it with you.
---
In the story section of the hero menu you should be able to see if they're locked or not. 
---
With 1.5k you can craft 1 gen1 legendary and 0 gen2.
---
stations on airship pass are also very close together
---
Once you get used to the layout you can get anywhere with a single jump and a single launch while in midair. It's insanely convenient. 
---
Well, you have mounts now so this should a piece of a cake.
---
Thanks for the advice and the link. Have a great day. x
---
Again big thanks for your work on this! I'll check this version out for sure but if the earlier one was any indication it's a bit too much for my i5-6600 to handle, actually lowering my average FPS despite getting rid of the stutters that occur with DX9. I suppose that is because my CPU was already on the limit in cities and group events and d912pxy increases the overall CPU load. I suppose it's i7s and ryzens that benefit the most from this tool.
---
For reference I have the same GPU as you (except 2GB version but I also play at 1680x1050 resolution which saves quite a bit of VRAM) and only 8GB RAM but I'm not maxing out that anyway.
---
&gt;A single season's episode isn't a huge sacrifice to make to test the waters to see how water content received by the players.
---
I think you're right, but I'm skeptical of whether or not it would be received that way. How loud will the minority of people who dislike it be? Will they even be a minority?
---
I also think that the reevaluation of underwater combat is probably more extensive than what the LWS team could handle on their own. If they bring in people from the main expac team, then they'd have the manpower, but would they have the time? Or would they need to start building it even as they're building their next map?
---
Which isn't to say that what you've suggested is a bad idea. So far as I can tell, it's one of only two ways of (sanely) approaching this. Either you create an experimental LWS episode, or you use some of the resources for developing the next expac to do some initial tweaks to underwater combat, then develop a small section of one of the new maps as a proof of concept - how new underwater content would look.
---
So yeah, not a bad idea. But I'm not sure its as simple as just doing it. I'd imagine that there's going to be a lot of development resources they'd have to commit to do even a cursory examination, and that will be enough to give the suits, obsessed with ROI, serious pause. So I wouldn't hold out any hope.
---
I do *hope* they go through with it, however.
---
Thank you for all the work you put into this!
---
But "Grey" doesn't refer to a colour but the man Christian Grey :D
---
Immediately upvoted. Looks really good, thanks for sharing.
---
Necromancer is actually solidly tanky. You'll like it.
---
I'm sorry that I want to have fun playing video games. It's my mistake for deciding what content I play based on the things I enjoy doing, and I'm a terrible person for avoiding content that I don't find fun. Shame on me for going onto a public forum and voicing my opinion about how a game mode that I *used* to find fun is no longer enjoyable because of decisions the developers have made, since at no point should anyone consider whether or not the video game is fun while designing it. What a fool I was to consider my enjoyment of the video game paramount to the experience.
---
You, sir, are a god among men and have enlightened me to the error of my ways. I will quit my day job and instead use my savings to merely subsist in real life while experiencing fractal birds all day every day in the height of their glory. To experience this masterwork, especially while on slippery floors, is the peak of human existence.
---
-------------------------------------------------
---
On a more serious note, I haven't played Molten Boss in a while, so I did not actually know that. I will swing by and check it out when I get a chance. Thanks for the update.
---
Sorry but supersample only works very well at 1080. At higer res you only get a more blurred image with lower fps.
---

Racing Scarf should be a good alternative to Caucedus shoulders IMO, dyed red like the strings on the coat.
---
You can get exotic stat selectable armor and weapons from reward tracks.
---
can not reproduce on my i7 6850k + 2080ti, fps stays the same 
---
https://imgur.com/a/QAPyZjk
---
I don't know what you've done but it was bad enough to get you grounded.
---
&gt; since i do mostly wvw? is there any path i can choose to get exotic trailblazer gear? that would be the best solution for me honestly
---
I always keep a few dozen of [these](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Armor_Box) around in case I want to try something. 
---
i will run back along to testing with this current batch of feedback XD thanks guys and gals 
---
Are you using heavy lumasharpen from Reshade?
---
The images looks so unnaturaly sharpened.
---
If so this is the reason cause you don't see the blur from supersample.
---
I LOOOOVEEEE this! 
---
you can get ascended weapons very cheaply by completing the caladbolg missions after completing the heart of thorns story, 1 per character. you can then select trailblazer stats on these weapons. [This is the wiki link for the caladbolg weapons and has a walkthrough about obtaining the weapons.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight_of_the_Thorn)
---
The fact that you are asking this shows that you are totally not the man for the job. 
---
A native solution would require to rewrite quite a bit of the engine itself for example. Rather than just changing the calls. 
---
&gt; i mean the article is not great but i don't think this is its weakest point
---
You are propably right but I stopped reading after the profession introduction.
---
Most people with some sort of technological understanding could probably see the difference. A band-aid would for example never work as stable and as well as a band-aid. It would also potentially end up getting quite broken if/when other changes were maid, either to the application itself or to the cards/drivers for example. 
---
So the triumphant path is the answer to my prayers isnt it? Haha 
---
Is the stat difference between ascended and exotic noticeable?
---
do you have depth blur on?
---
&gt;  as in I can call someone an asshole here whereas I can‚Äôt on the forums without the post being removed and getting a suspension
---
Except nobody called JP an asshole on reddit. 
---
She was a psychopath and was 100% responsible for her own misfortune. People were nice and respectful to her and she had a breakdown and started insulting the community because someone gave her a milquetoast suggestion.
---
SOOOOOOO sick, well done!
---
&gt; A native solution would require to rewrite quite a bit of the engine itself for example. Rather than just changing the calls.
---
You could try to read the whole post? And it wasn't meant to be a personal attack, it was simply a suggestion that the fact that you don't seem to know what the difference is would suggest you probably don't currently have the skillset required to actually implement it natively. 
---
what do you mean, [you people](https://youtu.be/xPxs0Qh72kY?t=33)?
---
Or she basically answered what Deroir was trying to ask about before? I can understand why that might annoy someone since it means one individual expects a tailored response because they can't be bothered checking what you wrote in a public forum and clearly think themselves worthy of a personalised response.
---
I really liked JP during the AMA and I think the outcome of the entire thing was a travesty, especially with PF being fired, so I can see why Arenanet don't want extra contact with the player base.
---
\&gt; If you are unwilling to play effectively, you will have little success in endgame content 
---
I don't need success, gameplay is enough for me. And as I'm keep hearing complaints about "not effective builds which make the whole team do stuff longer", that's pretty much serves as a proof you \*\*CAN\*\* do that kind of content with an ineffective approach - just it takes more time.
---
\&gt; That's terribly selfish and exploitative. 
---
Where is it selfish? I'm going full-disclosure and specifically ask for \*\*seemingly-minded\*\* community which don't have issues with such behavior and play the same way - exactly because stay away from toxic drama queens of elitist high-end content scene, so we would not bother each other. It's as far from selfish as it can be. Just because somebody doesn't respect your overly-serious view of the game doesn't give you right to go full ad hominem, your know
---
Yay, but I am still waiting for Planetside Arena...damn delays xD
---
&gt; optimized like a potato.
---
Actually the game is optimized fine, it's the fact that it's pushing the limits to dx9 is why fps is shit.
---
A lot of the classes change dramatically with the elite specs. 
---
For example, the Weaver Elite Spec (Elementalist) turns the typical caster class in a fast paced melee dps. My current favorite spec. 
---
I agree with you that the warrior human animations seemed heavy (particularly with the greatsword). But if you give spellbreaker a try and play Dagger/Axe - Axe/Dagger it can be very fast paced and fun. Not the most meta build but good enough if you bring banners. 
---
What I would do is check some youtube videos of some of the elite specs for each of the classes to see if you like them. If you want competitive specs, check snowcrows website and see the builds they have for each class, watch the video rotation and see if it is something you would enjoy playing. 
---
Low level gameplay won't be that indicative of how the high level class will play in case you go for an elite spec. 
---
I like this mode for one particular reason. It proved Anet lied about possible performance increase if they invested in dx12 and/or engine rework. Thank you for your job. This is yet another case to my list of Anet's lies I'm preparing.
---
&gt; And yes, a solid **dps boost** in areas where I'm not already at 15fps without it.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
So what you're saying is that actually you have no idea?
---
You are distorting my words.  I want to play for fun, not specifically be bad, and I need a group which plays for fun and thus don't care about efficiency that much (until they can complete content in a reasonable amount of time - like, it take 2 hours instead or 1) - exactly because I don't want to "drag down" anybody for whom it does matter.
---
I know. But they could have explained like like that and it would be cool. But they decided to lie.
---
And I can call someone an asshole on Twitter, so communication when your job is at risk is safer in a moderated place, I wouldn‚Äôt use Twitter either and I haven‚Äôt heard of anything coming from a devs Twitter in a while. If I was a dev at anet and I was asked to communicate with community I would say no unless I had gotten some social media training and it was in a well moderated place because screw getting fired for having a spat on the internet.
---
Could be bots too.
---
Haha okay thanks:) that makes more sense, cheers mate
---
&gt; what you're asking for is actually harder than just grabbing an existing build 
---
It's quite possible, but then again, I don't care if it's harder or not - only whether it's fun. As I answered in other comments here, repeating one meta skill combo or going along one effective meta rotation you have to memorize and always use is end of fun (and gameplay) for me. And until there is some interesting gameplay, it doesn't matter for me how hard it is, and how much time it takes to beat content (well, in some reasonable margins, like it's not a problem (for me) to spend 2 hours instead of 1, or only be able to beat content once per 2 attempts).
---
Yes, I believe it make it harder to fine a guild like that, as it may be pretty niche community. Still crossing my fingers.
---
No prob ^^
---
I'm surely would be learning encounters mechanics, and I'm willing to play my character better - until it doesn't involve memorizing some meta rotation and repeating it over and over again for hours, just to "clear faster".
---
But, as I've noted a few times already, I'm already respecting their time in the first place - by searching people who don't care about that time that much, so we would not irritate each other with our play-stiles. I can't get why so much people can't see it and go straight to accusations that I'm ruining a game for them. That's actually exactly what I want to avoid - need to play with people who perceive such playstile as end of their day.
---
naturally the gw2 community is *very special* and against this despite it likely being a huge improvement for variety.
---
"Game already has some imbalance so why not make it 10x worse?"
---
I'm sure there have been groups of friends that have gone into raids full "yolo" just for fun but this just doesn't last long, trust me.
---
Wiping to no end without a clear sense of direction wears down even the most staunch casual players. You just don't know that because you've never raided yourself.
---
You seem to think that you'd like it but it's a common human mistake to asume that we would enjoy something before even experiencing it.
---
Well, low-tier fractals are perfectly fine for me, I don't aim to the tops, in the first place. Though I just can't get why raids are off-limits as well, aren't there easier raids which even casual can beat, though spending twice as much time and effort? 
---
&gt;They have salaries 
---
Quite low salaries. Especially in Seattle.
---
Dunno about the asian part, I know asian is a really broad term and encompasses many different facial features but talking solely from and east asian standpoint I think there's 2 faces for human male and female, one of each pair being a very "semirealistic anime" look instead of an actual asian face. 
---
Personally I also really like how much diversity they put into the elonian faces overall. That's something they didn't consider when creating the white faces, most of them follow the same barbie doll principle which is annoying when you want to creater a character and not just a dress up doll.
---
I'm hoping they'll start adding more faces again soon. I think there's still both some core and PoF NPC faces that we don't have access to atm. The more options the better.
---
Indeed. Could be options in the bag dropdown underneath ‚Äòcompact‚Äô etc, it could say ‚Äòset as account-wide layout‚Äô and ‚Äòuse account-wide layout‚Äô. Then you only have one extra piece of data to save, ie the accountwide layout. Each character either uses it or their own.
---
TRON, fights for the user!
---
No crafting tho, and my main crafters are characters on a JP
---
Very nice concept. But I've tried to find out what skins you're using for the dress, and I didn't finish to locate them! Could you share them, please?
---
That's hardly is true, as many already confirmed here, that you can do at least dungeons and low-tier fractals with this approach for sure. In my experience, a categorical "NO" answer like this usually means "possible, but in a way I don't personally like and approve", in fact.
---
i haven't played in a while, what armour/outfit is that? it's lovely!
---
I can already taste the new power Meta if something like this would be impemented. All power specs with 3 power signets. 
---
Ahh this variety. These interesting builds! \s
---
Imo move to the PvP lobby and the dummy area and try everything out. You can go there with a lvl 2 but you are upscaled to lvl 80 and everything is unlocked including your elite specs. This way you really get to feel how every class and how it is played at level 80 which is VERY different form lvl 20. 
---
If you try a elite spec you can only do one at the time and you go to the pvp tab on top of your screen (nor your normal build tab) and add the traits you want and place the elite traitline at the bottom and now you can pick all skills belong to that elite spec.
---
You find the PvP lobby on upper left corner the icon furthest out. You will join the lobby and not a match so don't worry :)
---
As a answer to what you asked i would say Guardian or Necro. Both are played in a way that you can take on a lot and get away with it (if you learn how to play it ofc)
---
Also don't have tunnel vision on hearts, they are more of a pointer on the map and will tell you a little story about the area but it is the events that you should always pick first hand they also are additions to the story of the area if lore interest you. 
---
Same thing with mapcompletion. It is something you do not have to do. But if you like to do it by all means go for it, but again if you feel bored about it just leave it. You can come back later at level 80 if you want to make a first generation legendary and then you get Mastery experience for it instead.
---
Awesome work man. I never doubted you from the very beginning. Your tool is amazing and makes the game so much better to play.
---
ANet hasn't said anything yet about this specific tool but my guess is it's perfectly safe to use.
---
Read this topic both on arcdps and gw2 radial both [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/issues/38](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/issues/38)
---
I did not get that impression at all that he ask for people who want to carry him. I read through it and thought wow this guy is actaully doing what all those players who want to play it in their own way should do and trying to find a group for that and i appreciated the post. 
---
this game is more cpu intensive than gpu so you might want an upgrade if it runs poorly 
---
I use gw2hook solely to shut off bloom while retaining other post-processing features. So if you had to pick a feature I would go for that, something practical and gameplay-focused rather than flashy.
---
The other main feature is probably messing with the fog distance, I don't care for that but it does have a dramatic impact on the look of the game, and is more than just applying some messy coat of paint.

Dance the macarena in public while only wearing a pink string onsie
---
Well, nvidia geforce cards have code in drivers that block this technology on purpose to force people to get "nvidia grid" cards dedicated just for it. There are no problems with AMD cards though.
---
Assuming only default slots... 20*5 = 100, so you can make many combinations of rows and columns and keep a nice square (or rectangle) without the ending gaps.  (4x25, 5x20, 10x10, etc.)
---
Then you go to 32*5 = 160 and your square changes to some kind of rectangle.  (4x40, 5x32, 8x20, 10x16, etc.)
---
It gets even worse when we mix and match 18's and 20's (like 92 being most common, I would guess).  The best bet is to set around ten wide and then you (for op's combos) get either a ten row or sixteen row, which they have to scroll :x.  On all alts, you then do a twenty, three eighteens, and a sixteen to have nine rows of ten.
---
The reason that arrangement of the window can be important, for example, is having all your gear sets neatly lined up, or placing potions in a square to one side, or having the main food/util at the lower-left section for easy access during play, and other things like that.  So when you have OCD, you either make all characters have the same (or close), which is what I do, or end up with a mess between them :(
---
tl;dr: the hide bags option is really essential, but it does not solve our problem because math.
---
&gt;I don't understand why you got bombed with downvotes. 
---
Seems to me half of those people can't stand even a thought that somebody don't take what they do - high lv content - seriously (very sad case on itself, imo), and the others just have a personal thing against people like me ending in their groups through LFG (exactly what I'm trying to avoid by finding people who play game the same way as me), and they didn't care to spend time comprehending what I'm asking for, and just jumped straight to starting sharing their pain and building accusations.
---
The Astral and Stellar weapons require a week of doing a pre achievement to unlock from E1, IIRC. The Olmakhan Bandolier and Inquest Bacpiece from E2, the Dauntless backpack from E3, the Requiem Armor from E4, and the Dragonsblood weapons from E5. 
---
some people want to play a certain race they just don't like the VA. personally for me, it's human male. I don't dislike nolan north but i played way too much destiny 2 to ever want to hear his voice again... i still get nightmares from ghost's lines
---
Well you'll want to max out the crafting disciplines that you'll use for ascended crafting. If you level crafting while leveling you'll get about 7-10 levels from it (crafting 1-400) so it's a great source but honestly it's pretty easy to level so it's not a huge loss if you don't. I would suggest [following a guide](http://gw2crafts.net) when crafting though to make the leveling process faster and cost less.
---
Collect twenty coins, get a mystic coin?  Would maybe change the market a touch...
---
Something is bottlenecking your system, cause with those hardware it should run fine.  
---
Try to check temperatures at your hardware and check if everything working.   
---
Also it is highly advised to do a fresh install of the game.  
---
Putting gw2 folder in an SSD it can also increase performance a bit.
---
It provides a decent amount of experience, so if you have a character you want to level as well as a crafting discipline you want to level you'd be killing two birds with one stone. 
---
I *think* going from 0 to 500 nets you about ten levels. 
---
Ya I'm definitely an altaholic but I still don't know what I want my main to be lol
---
Sounds good. Thanks for the confirmation!
---
if it is the same as in season 4 it would be most likely the inquest backpiece
---
Absolutely gorgeous! Both the boy and the artwork itself!
---
So you have to use a specific manufacturer of GPU, plus WINE which may or may not produce good results for your particular game.
---
Yeah, sorry no, Linux gaming is just not there yet. It cannot compete with Windows to a point where it's practical to switch over to Linux.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Until I can install whatever game I want to play and have it give me just as good an experience in Linux as it does in Windows, **with whichever manufacturer's CPU/GPU I want**, Linux gaming will not be there.
---
Thanks. So, you think the best way to spend my pvp/wvw potions, is on the Istan reward track to get the trophy crates?
---
Well I'll like to see people finish T4s by using builds which don't make sense, for example, Power Staff Mirage. 
---
If Anet is reading this, can you guys put a tail on this costume? Pls.

&gt; were just releasing power from the Bloodstone among certain groups.

Citation? I'd love to see where you get that from. This isn't an attack by the way, I'm legitimately curious. I like to think I've read/seen all there is to see outside of the novels, I'd love to be wrong and see more cohesion in the lore.
---
Like people have said, with your specs you should have decent FPS in most places. WvW is a crapshoot but I guess you could try this if you want:

Showing done dungeons would be nice aswell. 
---
This tool, while awesome, is just a proxy and not something ANET would implement as an official fix for the game's performance. Making these changes directly in the client would probably be a colossal effort and thus not viable.
---
It's great that somebody is working on an unofficial performance fix, but it would be disingenuous to say ANET could have done that and just lied to us. 
---
No you don't. You literally need a few different options for alac and quickness together on one profession and then for all healers to be able to bring enough might and fury.
---
At that point it becomes a simple support (alac + quickness), healer, 3 dps setup. 
---
plus a lot of stuff with the chests, plus winterberries, plus champs that are almost soloable, plus ...
---
Fuck, I love bitterfrost.
---
I just do 10 items per row and hide bags.  That was when counting things/stacks of items across any character it is made infinitely easier.
---
Please keep at this! It's definitely far from ready to be in primetime but my jaw was on the floor at how much smoother it made my game right off the bat. Thunderhead Peak, Ember Bay, AND Shadow Behemoth all running like goddamn silk on improved settings from my normal!
---
"Laggy at some places"? I'm guessing you mean FPS drops, lag is connection related.
---
In zergs/Lions Arch/at worldbosses? - That is normal, turn character model/quality limits down. Any place with many people concentrated on one spot will cause any PCs FPS to dip.
---
Also yes, there are a few (newer) zones that really tax FPS as well, the dwarven ruins in the Desert Highlands for example, with all the hidden caves and the giant lavafall.
---
Else your PC should do fine. Perhaps you can set your GPU/Power settings to "best" or at least 'more' performance in 3D settings or Powersettings respectively. Also make sure your drivers don't cause any problems and you are really using your dedicated GPU instead of an integrated one.

Tonics do not count.

The tallest playable norn size doesn't get to 2.75m.

I never said SteamPlay/Proton utilizes DX12 but does it not use the more efficient dxvk solution on DX11 and DX12?

Goog job, my guy!

Why even buy an account? The fun is playing the game. 
---
I can increase my FPS by 10 or more frames in crowded places like cities and WvW by simply deactivating "show player names" in options.
---
I picture it like grape juice or a strawberry smoothie. 
---
Fuck, I need more fruit in my life. 
---
Yes. It's not worth it, especially with expansions on sale. Just buy the legit code.
---
stick to the wall,like snake!
---
You're assuming they care about the account when they are trying to sell it in the first place.  If they sell it, they dont care about what happens.
---
The second assumption is that they are selling their own account, a lot of times account sellers are selling accounts they stole from improperly secured accounts.
---
The third assumption is that you think you may get refunded.  Often times sold accounts get reclaimed after a significant amount of time has passed, that way there's no way to dispute the transaction.
---
If you want to play the game, buy  license from a authorized seller, dont buy an account from a person.
---
First, I think you need to try them out in the PvP lobby (where everything is unlocked), because if you're just running around in the open world at level 10-20, you're not really going to experience what the class is like. At that point, you're going to have a limited choice of utility skills, you won't have an elite skill, and you won't have any specialisations unlocked. Classes change a lot in how they play compared to what you have access to at the beginning. Also, elite specialisations change them even further, and in most cases are different enough to be thought of as entirely different classes. 
---
I've played a lot of classes now (not all, and not all elite specs, so I don't have all the answers), so this is what I think: 
---
* Warrior - As someone else said, try axe/axe. It doesn't root you to one spot as much as the greatsword, and is still a decent build (it's what I used to level to 80). I wasn't actually a big fan of spellbreaker, but I enjoyed beserker. I changed it up a bit and went with a longbow, and found it great for rapidly attacking mobs with lots of burning. 
---
* Guardian - The health pool is low, but that doesn't mean it isn't tanky. It has access to a lot of blocks and active damage mitigation, so as long as you're paying attention, you won't take much damage anyway (but get lazy and you'll be dropped pretty quickly). I personally didn't like base guardian, but I had some fun with both the elite specs. 
---
* Revenant - I've not played it much, so I won't say anything here. 
---
* Ranger - The pet works well at giving you a chance to use your ranged attacks. Most enemies will run to you as soon as you attack, but if the pet keeps them busy you can actually attack at range without needing to run backwards. Still, if you don't like the AI (this is my main class, but even I eventually got tired of it), then there's the soulbeast elite spec, which I love. You merge with your pet, gaining 3 new skills and a stat boost (depending on the pet), meaning no pet AI. The dagger as a main hand weapon allows you to get up close and deal fast melee attacks, then I use the shortbow to attack them while keeping just outside of melee range. 
---
* Thief - I've not tried the daredevil elite spec, but deadeye has what you could call passive defence. You can attack from very far away, and you have access to a lot of stealth (with the right trait chosen, every time you dodge), so in that way you'll be avoiding a lot of damage. It's not quite as mobile though. 
---
* Engineer - The one class I have absolutely zero experience with so far. 
---
* Necromancer - This one is probably what you're after, specifically with the reaper elite spec. It's passively tanky because the shroud has its own health pool in addition to the main one. Reaper shroud gives you access to a bunch of melee skills (with a giant spectral scythe), and you can set it up for permanent quickness, so it's very fast and fluid. Also, you can easily switch to a minion build, which I think is by far the best option for tackling difficult open world challenges (like when doing group event hero points while solo). 
---
* Elementalist - I've only played it a bit, so I think I'd better let others give advice on it
---
* Mesmer - It's been a while since I played it, but I believe they should move onto your next target. But you have to actually be in combat with them before killing your current target, or they'll shatter. It's a great class if you like playing mind games and tricking enemies. I've not played any of the elite specs though, so I can't speak for those. 
---
 If you want to look up builds, search for metabattle. They have builds for open world/fractals/raids/etc. for every class. I'm not saying you should stick to what they say, but it's a good starting point from which you can tweak the build to your liking. 
---
If by 'quests' you mean hearts, hearts were intended as filler content for the core maps, they're not the primary activity you're meant to be doing.  That's why they don't exist in the end-game zones of the core game and in Heart of Thorns maps (though they've returned since then).  In the new maps, you're meant to explore and to do the various event chains.  In the daytime (Even:30 to Odd:45 server time) there will be five event chains throughout the map, one at each outpost, which will give you a lot of XP for completing them.  At night-time (Odd:45 to Even:30 server time), the map gets more dangerous and there'll be random events all over the place, culminating in fights in the canopy at Odd:10 server time against five bosses.  Then when the next day dawns, it starts over again.
---
That's for Verdant Brink, at least.  The next map, Auric Basin, operates on a similar concept but with different timing, its normal event cycle starting at Odd:30 and going to Even:45, with its boss battle starting at Odd:00 with fifteen minutes of prep beforehand.
---
They never said that there would be no performance increase, they just said the gains aren't worth, which is in fact true.  
---
To have actual gains, they must rewrite the game engine, which is a totally different thing and requires a lot of testing.
---
Actually no part of the game teaches you how to raid or raid mechacs. So it doesn't matter if he levels up normal way or buys account / boosts himself.
---
It's one thing to translate dx9 to dx12 on the user end. It's something completely different (or not even feasible) to implement something like this on the devs end (and they can't have **any** crashes for any user).
---
It might e something to look at, but definitely not as easy as some might suggest.
---
I already can exp clear w1-w4.  I just want to quickly change builds for WvW.
---
If you follow the Personal Story for Heart of Thorns, it will take you on a linear journey through the maps.  won't require a lot of exploration and it is fairly independent of most of what happens on the maps.
---
However if you want to see the most of what it has to offer (as well as collections, etc), you need to get involved with the metas that take place, and explore.  Each map has a central "theme" that is relevant to the overall war against Mordremoth.
---
You should already be level 80, if not then don't go to those maps on a low level character.  You will get obliterated.
---
Best advice I can give is to take your time on each map.  Follow the story, learn the meta for each map, get mastery points (you will need a ton) and as you do these things, it will all come together.
---
These are really good points, I hadn't considered the point of someone selling a hacked account.  
---
Although, to have DoB and original address of a hacked account seems unlikely.  Not to mention having those AND not having the hack disputed already by original owner.
---
&gt;So not high end content, then.
---
Well, how do you suggest to call it then? :) It's definitely high-lv content, as the system won't let you in until you'll reach lv 80. But, anyway, that's exactly what I wanted to say: I want to play some end-game content (doesn't matter if it will be only low-tier end-game content) in a relaxed group of semi-casual players which don't care about "wasted time" and "not putting out meta dps".
---
&gt;Which shouldn't be an issue, if you don't care if you kill the boss at the end of the day 
---
Yes, that' not a big problem to me. Thanks, I hope I'll find some people who feel the same, doesn't really seem to me it's that hard at all, it's just it's hard to reach them as seeing how much backlash a simple request like this can meet here, I may imagine why they don't frequent discussion boards like this.
---
Ah ofc :) Have been thinking about that myself, would be interesting to see if it performs any better in Linux.
---
Right on, best of luck. Personally it seems to risky, but if you won't be upset if it gets banned eventually, go for it.
---
To add to that, a player should at least be proficient in the Silverwastes meta before starting off in Verdant Brink.  SW is a good training ground to get a feel for many of the most common Mordrem enemies.
---
You said you want to try out ‚Äúlegendary armor‚Äù just to be clear they have the same stats as ascended. You can also spend real money to convert gems into gold to make ascended armor faster and in pvp armor doesn‚Äôt matter. Honestly the only thing that you will get by buying this account is bragging rights (about something most people don‚Äôt care about) in a game you are not invested in. I would say don‚Äôt buy an account and just get you own and pay to get gold to help you with whatever you want to do.
---
I'm interested in the quick stat change / rune swapping capabilities of the armor to mess with builds quickly and on the fly for wvw.
---
He's not really mad, he sees you as a business opportunity.
---
Would there be some (probably wonky) setup to use this and Proton or Wine in tandem on Win8.1? Or am I asking for trouble? :D
---
Weaver is pretty much an improvement over the core Ele, so I left it for the future. I also still want to have a bit more time having fun with dagger/dagger setup, so I went into the direction of adapting Tempest to this playstile. In openworld, it works quite fine so far, though I'm still learning and trying to find the most convenient setup for my tastes. But as the only meta for dps Tempest seems to be horrendous abusing of a single "Fresh Air / Air Overload" combo, going meta on it is not an option, for me. And without this, playing the way I like, I only can achieve around 8k dps on the golem, under full set of offensive boons I put on myself via the console in Special Forces training instance.
---
Hey, it's always worth trying. Takes half a minute to install and another to delete if it doesn't work.
---
&gt;That's pretty much quite categorical statement, especially taking into account that a few users already have posted in this thread claiming they know such communities and offered me to help joining them.
---
Cool, but I didn't say they never existed. I said it doesn't really exist. And I am going to bet that in those groups, you will find that even they will expect you to play in a way that makes sense and contributes to the group. If not, then well it's basically just a casual, play-how-I-want group, which like another user said, is firmly in the casual side. There's no real 'middle ground' like what you describe.
---
&gt;Also in the light of the fact there are videos on youtube showing how at least some of the fractal and raid bosses can be soloed, one can doubt that a group of not very effective semi-casual players couldn't beat them too, though perhaps with much more time and effort invested (and the later isn't a problem for me at all).
---
Those players who did the solo stuff weren't non-meta, play how I want type players. Those were players who in a 5-man group, min max and optimize shit -- your usual speedrun player, basically. Of course in a solo attempt you build differently, but you will find one common thread; it is all designed for as little tankiness as possible, and as much as they can throw towards DPS that won't kill them.
---
&gt;Yes, I indeed like to see some challenge in my games, thanks for being interested in humble me enough to do some research like that btw :) But, as in anything I do, both in games and IRL, I never go to extremes, nor I'm ready to sacrifice too much to just "get things done in most effective way" - making the whole thing fun and full of diverse experiences is number one priority, the rest should just be at "okish" level.
---
It's hardly research when everything you post is in the open. And you seem to have gotten the entire idea of the meta mistaken. I don't play a meta DPS class with the most optimized gear and stats as well, but I make sure my build works and actually contributes into clearing content. And people are very understanding when you're not fully optimized. Shit is expensive, impractical or not worth the effort. That's fine. The issue here is that you seem to want people who will indulge crappy builds in endgame content for hours and hours of potential failures. I'm going to say this right now, you'll have a very bad experience when that happens if you don't adapt, even if the people you play with are casual and chill.
---
&gt;So yes, I'm looking for a particular kind of challenge which you can approach without reducing your actions to spam of single meta rotation, otherwise it just isn't worth time to even start, for me. I.e., I see no point whatsoever in just "beating the content", not to say "doing it faster" - if to do that you need to "gut your character" of anything inefficient and throw out a lot of tactics and play-stiles simply because "they are not that efficient and will force you to spend 1.5 hours on an instance which you can beat in 30 minutes, while putting in twice as much efforts" - again, it's not a problem for me at all, nor the additional time, neither the additional effort, as long as my gameplay is diverse and I can play my character in a lot of different ways, not just one effective meta way.
---
And it's not worth anyone's time to play with you if you're unwilling to learn either. You think you're special, but I have seen *thousands of similar arguments* in my years of playing GW2, and all of them can be boiled down to 'I want to play how I want and fuck the rest of my group'. It's a lazy, self-centered point of view. Before you say 'I'll do what I want' -- you're allowed to think that way, and do what you want, yes. But, others are also allowed to criticize it.
---
&gt;And unfortunately being "just" 90% of meta is not what I'm talking about, it's more like being 50%, at best.
---
Then you'd better have one hell of a build that blows people's minds, a very tolerant group of friends or just do things solo, because that kind of approach is not acceptable.
---
I'm still on Win8.1, so I wonder if there's a way to get this going with Wine or Proton...
---
How to make a personal opinion some sort of fact, exhibit A.
---
&gt; Although, to have DoB and original address of a hacked account seems unlikely. Not to mention having those AND not having the hack disputed already by original owner.
---
how do you know the DoB and adress they give you matches the ones on file at Anet?
---
&gt;i prefer a more bruiser playstyle, like sword and board with damage or a fast 2H. a medium tank playstyle with nice passive tankiness / recovery. i dont really care about burst but just doing good damage. i like being mobile and having a bit of mobility but dont like it being the sole defense and damage avoidance of a class. 
---
Once you get past the softer early levels and start getting traits and utilities unlocked this is the Guardian. 
---
&gt;And FYI for the last one : I did play Healer Reaper. It's weak and doesn't work in T4s or any high level content.
---
As a fellow reaper lover I'm kinda curious about what you did tbh, sounds like an interesting story!
---
Outfit is just a skin that applies to your entire armor.
---
It really just boils down to whether you like the outfit better than the non-outfit armor skins.
---
Use the wardrobe section of your bank to see if you can come up with anything that you like.
---
if you like an outfit, got for it. as you already stated yourself, they are purely visual. generally they are very limiting in terms of fashion wars. mix and matching is completely out of the question, and dye slots, the only modifiable thing about them, are limited to 4 for the entire thing, as opposed to up to 4 per each of the 6 armor pieces - though it doesn't seem like you'd have a problem with that.
---
in the end you need to be ok with your characters look, just don't ever expect any positive feedback on an outfit based look, since it's generally regarded as a cheap/easy/utterly uncreative way to make your character look somewhat decent.
---
I'm talking about GPU utilization, not VRAM usage.
---
High CPU usage can also cause low GPU usage, since the GPU is now waiting for the CPU to finish calculating for the next frame.
---
You can wear outfits at any level, doesn't need transmutation charges or anything. It's an easy way to look good.
---
Skins unlocked by crafting are not the best looking ones. You can check all available skins at wardrobe panel at bank and then Google how to obtain them. Often people focus on crafting when they want ascended armor for playing fractals. 
---
Yeah, low tier fractals are fine, so don't worry about getting a lot of AR. But as a general rule, raids are harder than high tier fractals. It's definitely possible to clear raids with non-meta builds, but clearing them with ineffective builds is just plain impossible. There's a simply a higher bar to entry.
---
If your group isn't bringing effective builds that create a raid with enough DPS then you will run into a DPS check that *stops* your progression, not just slowing it down. There are specific bosses and events that might be possible because of lack of DPS/CC checks, but you'd have to do research to figure out what you are or aren't allowed to do. It's not about "twice as much time and effort". Without effective builds, you will run into unbreakable walls of content.
---
Outfits are nice to have if you find yourself in shit looking armour that has decent stats. Especially pre lvl 80. 
---
Crafting is 100% worth it at completely necessary if you don‚Äôt regularly play fractals (and hope to get ascended armour chests) or raids (and also hope to get ascended armour cheats). 
---
Ascended armour is the natural progression after exotic quality. Exotic is easy to come by; can be bought, crafted, looted. But ultimately ascended is much better though I would definitely craft ascended weapons first. Speaking of ascended weapons, you can do the specialisation collections for an ascended weapon if you haven‚Äôt got your crafting up by then. 
---
I digress, sorry, outfits are worth it to cover up mismatched armour but only for aesthetic purposes, don‚Äôt buy them if you haven‚Äôt got the RL money or in game gold. 
---
Once you hit lvl 80 you will probably have been given a fair few pieces of exotic armour, whether they are the stats you want though depends on what you‚Äôre playing. Fairly sure I got a bunch of stats that were useless to me. 
---
&gt; So, you basically have met thousands of people in the game who are inclined to the same kind of playstile as myself, and then you claim that "it's not worth anyone's time to play with you if you're unwilling to learn either". Don't you see a little contradiction here? ;) And in no way I think I'm special, quite contrary - I'm almost sure there are a lot of people who feel the same about the game, and that's the only people I would like to be in a grop with - hence the original inquiry it all started with. Again, your own statement proofs that those people exist. Thus I can't see your point.
---
Not at all. Because those players, more often than not don't actually find groups to do it with, but complain that they get kicked from pugs for not playing the meta way. And those are **not** middle ground players like you stated in your OP, but are fully casual, PHIW players. Go to the forums and you'll see them a lot -- especially in the 'raids should be easier' threads.
---
As a pretty casual player who used to be hardcore (I was raiding at launch and used to clear wings 1 and 2 every week when those were the only ones around), I stand by what I said. You won't find the players willing to do what you want that will stick around for long unless you *adapt*. Casual players aren't idiots, they want to get things done as well, even if it's not as fast. 
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure I stated quite clear that I need a seemingly-minded people who don't care about efficiency or (success at all) that much, and just play it for fun. I can assure it again, if you need: I don't need a group which will "carry me", quite in contrary - I don't want to be in such group, no matter what, I don't like to be in the places I don't belong to, overall. That's why I want to find a stable community of people who willingly throw effectiveness to the wind and just play it for the fun of it.
---
For you, wiping for hours on say, Siren's Reef might be fun. You may even find like-minded people who will agree for say, 5 wipes. Maybe even 10 or 15. But nobody will want to spend a few hours wiping on endgame content without **any sign of progress**. Again, the community you want is unlikely to exist, because it requires an enjoyment of failure -- and we're not wired to enjoy failure. It's the human condition.
---
Have fun searching, but I don't think this is going to be a game you'll enjoy for long if you refuse to adapt. 
---
Rifle is bad for open world.  I mainly PVP, but when I PVE I go with AOE set ups.  Staff/Bound Daredevil is great and with mounts you no longer need Dash to get around.  Lately though I‚Äôve been using Deadeye S/P with Shortbow with DE haste and recks AOE with constant remarking and haste.  I change out to rifle or P/P when needed for single targrt..
---
Well he made clear hard time is not a problem so he wanted to try it and was looking for people to do it with. 
---
Thing is this triggerd a lot of people when it should not because he is doing exactly what we want him to do, find a group that want the same thing. I mean people even downvoted the guilds responding, hey we might be what you looking for. Why are people so afraid of other players doing their thing together with other people tha want the same thing. 
---
The fashion. It was the fashion.
---
what
---
&gt; But like I said it's not really pertinent to GW2 or Mordremoth at hand so
---
And yet you wrote such unnecessary stuff...
---
&gt;While I have insulted your character I have re-iterated my points about western designs of dragons making more sense due to Arenanet being a western studio several times over with no rebuke from you on any of those arguments.
---
&gt;Why are you even here in the subreddit anymore
---
&gt;Go elsewhere
---
Yeah, I see. Those things **really** reiterated your points about western design. How could I not see! It's so obvious!
---
Dude, are you drunk?
---
&gt;I can insult your character all I want because my points made about the game and Mordremoth's design don't rely on ad hominem to try to appear credible.
---
So you say "I can insult you all I want, because my arguments are right? 
---
Dude really, Are You Drunk?!?
---
As I said at some other points, *nobody* can be this stupid, not even you. So I think either you are drunk/high or what I think since a few posts -&gt; just a troll. 
---
For the unlikely case that you **are** serious on this statement: Well, have fun with the Reddiquette, seems like you haven't read it before. 
---
&gt;Insult others. Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion
---
(So does it mean you never were interested in a rational discussion? Since you started insulting very early.)
---
&gt;So yeah, I'm gonna throw some shade at you while still holding the initiative for a proven argument.
---
No, you don't. Learn the rules of this forum. ;)
---
However, you also have no proven argument to the point that you disguised your opinion as facts to give them more expression.
---
PS. Since you unceasingly come up with your "Anet is a western studio" "argument": 2 points, a counter argument and the reality. 
---
1.) Counter argument: Anet is a western studio so dragons must be western style? So what about the celestial dragon, which **is** a chinese style dragon? Or the mystical dragon mini and the snow flurry dragon? Both chinese dragons.
---
And what about the whole Faction campain of GW1? The **whole game** is in asia style. Including Kuunavang **another** chinese dragon.
---
Also "is a western studio" means absolutely nothing. No game studio bounds their game/ideas to their country. It's the opposite, for western countrys asian stuff is exotic. Also for asian countrys western stuff is exotic. It's pretty common for both to use the opposite style to show exotic things. 
---
2.) And now the reality. Your argument is obsolete. As I said several times before, the original "discussion" about Mordremoth's physical form is *over*. 
---
It's over since the moment I revealed that it's all only your own opinion and you confirmed it. It's absolutely nonsense to discuss about anyones own opinion, so you can bring up your "Anet is a western studio" as much as you want, it doesn't change anything, because nobody wants to discuss you own opinion. Me neither.
---
Whatever, like all the other times you won't understand *this* too, start again with wich clubs you joined in school, how I "flee" from the discussion and bring more insults with your, right? Ofcourse you will, because I still think you are nothing more than a bad troll.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65547/policy-third-party-programs
---
&gt;The best way for you to assess whether a specific third-party program could have any impact on another player is to ask:
---
    "Does this program allow someone to play faster, better, longer, or more accurately than someone who doesn't use the program?"
---
    "Does this program allow someone to 'play' when he/she is not at the computer?"
---
    "Does this program allow the user to gain unnatural or undeserved rewards?"
---
Nice
---
&gt;If they ever say anything about this mod that's not an explicit "no do not use this", they would have given tacit permission to use it, and thus become responsible to support any and all problems that the mod causes.
---
I am not sure if that's true. AFAIK other games that allow mods/addons (i.e. WoW) are not responsible for support related to problems caused by mods.
---
i have an i8700k and a 1080ti. I get pretty much the same fps. Nothing is wrong with your system, the game is just bad. You shouldn't compare this to current gen games.
---
I personally prefer outfits over all the other skins. Other players spend countless hours getting certain looks/dyes but an outfit is an easy way to cheese out a nice look for all your characters. When you get to 80, it'll be a bit challenging to get your first ascended set. Crafting one is still in excess of 250g nowadays, so try to cut up that number as much as possible by doing achievements for accessories, farming living season 3 maps for more accessories, and when you got enough AR start joining fractals. Making a daily routine out of fractals will ensure you, after a while, a steady (mostly liquid gold) income everyday, as well as a decent chance of getting ascended armor chests. It'll help elavate you from open world grinding on the next difficulty tier gamemode. But yet again, the skins will be mostly mediocre. Ascended skins are a little bit nicer than others, especially some of the weapons, but as a beginner it's better if you stick to these normal skins because at your level right now, shelling out the gems on outfits is unjustifiable. An outfit is at least 700gems, or at least 230g. Think about that. It's late game content, frankly.
---
i think it was fixed; but the old dream used to be walking someone back and forth through spectral wall; which chill or cripple was needed to do (could to with spectral walk or flesh wurm, but not for the lifetime of the wall)... sadly this sort of gameplay doesnt fly so well in current gw2 but i suppose you might be able to catch someone off guard with their defences down
---
There is something with vkd3d, but not working yet.
---
I generally agree with your statements (in one way or another) and the aspects I disagree with are minor and because my current employment is in a very adjacent area. However, I think this statement is the important one;
---
&gt; But I'd like to believe we can agree that responding to ignorance with hostility usually doesn't end well for anybody. It just gets somebody pissed off and usually cements another person's ignorance. 
---
This is exactly what this Reddit and a huge number of people on Twitter *didn't* do. They encouraged a witch hunt over something that was, at the end of the day, relatively minor. There were no winners from them doing that and if people really had opted to avoid hostility we might have two great writers still working on the game, Deroir not given the side-eye by many segments of the playerbase and Anet not receiving mountains of negative publicity. Instead, in true reddit style, we don't let people live their mistakes down and keep quoting things that rile up drama all over again.
---
Officially saying "this is not against the rules to use" is all it takes to assume responsibility. If someone gets a crash with the mod, now anet cannot just pretend it doesn't exist. If someone takes the code, injects malware, and people get hacked over it, anet now has to spend time and money to respond.
---
This is standard procedure for almost every software developer.
---
It is bad, daredevil is way better for open world 
---
I was there a week ago. It's tough.
---
I'm going to copy what I wrote in another thread with a slight edit. There are better options for dealing with groups of mobs in open world but if I want to stick with Rifle then pull mobs and use rifle 2 when kneeling, pierce through mobs to immobilise them together, throw out an Assassin's Signet buffed Shadow Flare on the snared group, use Rifle 2 to hold them in place and use Dagger Storm as an AoE finisher if needed.
---
If the mobs aren't in a nice line for Rifle 2, use Death's Retreat to move backwards and force them to reposition and move closer together in order to reach you.
---
For this to work best you want to run Invigorating Precision (lots of healing from Shadow Flare and Dancing Dagger), Payback (cooldown resets) and Improvisation (cooldown resets). Burst of Shadows can also be useful. You want to keep the mobs together with Rifle 2 and recast Deadeye's Mark as often as possible to force resets on Shadow Flare and Dancing Dagger.
---
Go look at the TOS for third-party tools. Go down the list and ask yourself if having the game run more smoothly with better performance for the same level of CPU/GPU load violates any of those tenets.
---
You *should* arrive at "no" for all of them. It doesn't run afoul of any of them, but you'll never hear ANet actually give approval for use. In a case like this, you'll have to assume "ArenaNet knows about this, they know it's being actively worked on and that more people are starting to use it, but they haven't come out and said it's prohibited to use." And believe me; if ANet wanted to prohibit use of this, they absolutely could. It's well-known that multiple ANet employees browse the subreddit and interact with us.
---
Giving specific approval puts the company on a hook they don't want to be on. Not saying anything at all allows development and use to continue, but keeps them off the hook and leave it in a "use at your own risk" state, which is where it would have to end up anyway.
---
Jeeez this is harsh, i'm doing that and i don't see the light at the end
---
P/P deals damage in long and powerful burts, no buildup is required. Rifle requires you to mark every single target and kneel, which makes you an easy pick for anything that hits hard. To kill veterans or better mobs efficiently you also need to build up malice and spend it on stealth attacks. You have to rely on stealth skills on long cooldown and the DE trait that makes you invisible after each dodge. Both weapons have a huge issue with groups (absolutely no aoe, melee is always better in this case), but it's far easier to switch targets when you're on pistols, because they don't need marks to work.
---
It's not that rifle is totally useless in the open world. Other options are simply much faster and require less work for your kill. For many events (and several raid boss fights) you can just camp in a corner and shoot at everything that moves, but if you're bothered by mobs and aoes begin to land on you, it's far better to just stand up and deal with them upfront. In the open world it's a secondary weapon at best.
---
We all do, after all, we have infinite number of skills, and even though I hate repetitiveness and meta, I don't got the other extreme direction by mashing buttons randomly - I still try to do some meaningful combos with my skills. But there is a big difference still between just constantly abusing one trick, and repetitiveness like this which includes most of your skills, I can clearly feel it when I play the game. It's kind of difference which separates fun from a chore for me.
---
Speaking from years of maining Thief: full berserk Daredevil with Staff (and 'Invigorating Precision' if needed) is by far the best for Open World... DE is immobil, squishy and only single target... exactly what you do not want for Open World.
---
Rifle DE for raids? Yeah, have fun with it :P
---
&gt; AFAIK other games that allow mods/addons (i.e. WoW) are not responsible for support related to problems caused by mods.
---
It's a much less risky position to take. When a software developer takes such a stance, they do know how much damage a malicious person can cause through going through such channels.
---
The maximum amount of damage a malicious person can cause through DLL injection is... anything the computer can do. If any such person would achieve nefarious ends, any developer which gave their go-ahead would at the very least have a PR storm on their hands. Disclaimers may protect you against liability, but they don't work as well for negative publicity.
---
*Too Lewd*
---
\#skrittwisdom Real and true. True is shiny.
---
You'll probably have much better luck approaching the reshade developers, since it is still actively being developed for.
---
Gw2hook is a fork of the reshade project. While gw2hook doesn't support anything beyond dx9, reshade supports DX11.2 (as well as opengl, dx10, etc), and possibly dx12 in the future. Asking the reshade devs to get chainloading working would be much more likely to succeed.
---
yes but its much more time consuming then the druid stone back, so comparing the effort u have for the collections the 2 backpacks are closer to each other then the weapon collction especially with all the map currency u need for the weapon 
---
This information can lead to compromising an account in the first place and thus leading to selling a stolen account.
---
&gt; As though doing a meta rotation were some sort of exploit.
---
it's not an exploit technically, but in its nature it's still is. And yes, I can't help but feel animosity against it as it reduces the gameplay for a very diverse class I like so much in the first place (and it was the reason why I chose it) to using just a tiny subset of its abilities because they are so much better than anything else. The latter is just a sign of a bad game design, to me.
---
So you want to abandon an account with progress established... for the convenience of stat swapping?
---
The fuck?
---
Can't be. Must have used a DSLR camera. 
---
And yet he got several guilds saying they might be what he is looking for.
---
And i am not complaining on the way you play the game and that you feel you are a casual, but you kind of mix your self up with how others might look at what casual is. And even so if this guy find a group that are willing to play it the way they decide is what they want then that is really their buisiness. It might not work at all or they find a way to make it work or they adjust in a way that work for them. Either way it is what they choose and he want to try that experience. 
---
There was so many posts that it was hard to pick and your kind of put words on it to make it more clear were it went wrong and why i picked your post. And i don't say you downvoted him but there are obviously a shit ton of players that did even though the person is doing exactly what this people been telling him to do since raids came out, make your own group with your own preferences. But instead they jump on him and make them self the worst memes on reddit. It just blows my mind. 
---
Haven't been around for awhile. Mesmer now has two PvE DPS possibilities? Power Chrono and Condi Mirage?
---
Add the extra level and make it a pic of a screenshot
---
I'm sure anet is already using your code internally. After all, you've given them permission: it's right in the license file in the project's GitHub.
---
In fact, you've given anet (and literally EVERYBODY) permission to use your code for any and all purposes, including selling it commercially, both by itself or as part of some other software, as long as they provide a copy of the license document with their software.
---
This means that anet can quite literally release a "dx12 beta" client, that consists of nothing but the stock client, d912pxy, and a precompiled shader cache, and be able to call all of it theirs and sell it, because you've given them permission.
---
If you are ok with this, then that's fine. If not, you may want to contact anet, ncsoft... Or change the software license.
---
Guarantee is the new one in LA , Kiel's office. 
---
By that logic all hacks and exploits are okay to use until Anet explicitly says no
---
Expecting Anet to be aware of every little tool/add-on people have made and expecting them all to be okay until otherwise stated is not a good way to go about things. Official acknowledgement doesn't have to be "yes this is ok to use" and Anet has given tentative approval of other tools such as arcdps, taco, and iirc even augtyria. There are people out there who still make/use tools that can inspect the gear of other players and that has been explicitly decried by Anet.
---
I dunno about arcdps helping anyone play better, faster or anything as it's just a number calculator basically. It does nothing that anyone with basic math skills can't do. 
---
As for Taco then we may as well as ban people from using Dulfy and other online guides because that's exactly what Taco does. It provides the same content a guide could but overlayed on your screen. 
---
It does not give anyone an unfair advantage over anyone and it doesn't do anything that anyone with two brain cells can't find on the internet.
---
You're being antagonistic just because it's A-Net.
---
Sure, you're welcome :) Spoiling somebody else's game won't give me any satisfaction either, so finding people sharing the same vision seems like the most reasonable way to achieve my goal.
---
No, they don't? Arcdps has absolutely no impact on your gameplay, it shows what already happened.
---
Taco too doesn't make you play better by any means, it just shows where(?) to go and some minor stuff.
---
&gt;By that logic all hacks and exploits are okay to use until Anet explicitly says no
---
Well, yes. All hacks and exploits are allowed until they aren't. This isn't new, and shouldn't be controversial.
---
First off, congrats!
---
I made my first legendary after I had been playing the game about 1 1/2 years, way back when WvW maps had to be completed for world completion and ktraining was THE way to get obsidian shards.  Twilight was worth it, though.  Now each one I make takes less and less time.
---
On the note of anyone doing it quicker, I knew a guy in my old guild who got his first legendary about two weeks after starting the game, but he bought a lot of gems to convert to gold so...
---
&gt; how to take a picture of my screen
---
"Nonsense, i can take a picture of anything and that includes my screen " üì∏
---
Toy with the wardrobe and make your own unique look with mixed in-game armors. That will give you more goals to complete in the game, maybe give you incentives to complete content you didn't think of like old dungeons and the satisfaction of having your character reflect your personal taste rather than wearing a boring outfit and being another uninspired clone. 
---
Nah I think he's just a great artist. 
---
Taco pathfinding is a guide of sorts; it doesn't actually make you faster, it just shows you a way to go.
---
arcdps doesn't actually improve you; it just gives you a way to measure. Arguably the gear templates does give you an advantage in some niche circumstances for everything, though not realistically
---
And both were given tentative approval by Anet
---
This is just in, price of invisible walls went up 400% on the gamedev market
---
More violets, I say. Less violence.
---
OK, thanks :)
---
I think (hope) we'll see Kralks full body at some point, maybe at a final fight if there will be one. I don't think (hope) they'll put only his head in the game for a third time
---
I agree with you. I was merely pointing out that there's still a difference between d912pxy and a native dx12 implementation.
---
Practically speaking, the difference is pretty small, but a difference still remains.
---
I'm also pretty sure that anet is using at least your shader translation code internally now. One of the challenges of porting to dx12 is that there are thousands of shaders that need to be rewritten, and you've just given them the code to batch convert all of their shaders.
---
I saw those too. But I highly doubt they're the 'middle ground' guilds the OP wanted initially. And honestly, they've since clarified they wanted dungeons and low-tier fractals too -- that's something any guild can do. Hardly a high bar.
---
&gt;And i am not complaining on the way you play the game and that you feel you are a casual, but you kind of mix your self up with how others might look at what casual is.
---
I am very much on the casual spectrum. Casual does not mean not following meta or being a bad player, it just means not doing everything hardcore. 
---
&gt;And even so if this guy find a group that are willing to play it the way they decide is what they want then that is really their buisiness. It might not work at all or they find a way to make it work or they adjust in a way that work for them. Either way it is what they choose and he want to try that experience.
---
And that's fine. But in group content, it's not about the individual. It's about the group. And every group needs to be adaptable. OP not being adaptable to begin with is already an issue in and of itself.
---
&gt;There was so many posts that it was hard to pick and your kind of put words on it to make it more clear were it went wrong and why i picked your post. And i don't say you downvoted him but there are obviously a shit ton of players that did even though the person is doing exactly what this people been telling him to do since raids came out, make your own group with your own preferences. But instead they jump on him and make them self the worst memes on reddit. It just blows my mind.
---
People are likely bashing him because of their own bad experiences with similar players. Is that fair? No, probably not. But OP isn't exactly helping when he initially gave the impression of wanting to look for players who could carry him.
---
look at character portraits in character selection screen
---
Lol it violates the first rule as people with megais d912pxy actually get fluent frames instead of stuttering mess in wvw, unfair advantage :D
---
that whoud explain why in ls 1 we were told that kasmeer is naked all the time, ls2 was story of 2 leasbians,ls3 had gay boss,with pictures of naked logan. this game have plenty of sexual topics.
---
That would do the trick, but it would be a tad boring. 
---
Making them salvageable also has an added benefit. The TP is full of recipes that have been becoming practically worthless.  
---
If they were salvageable into some items with the chances just right enough to produce an average minimum value in their results, they could be adjusted to stay around 2-10s minimum instead going all the way down to 2 copper. 
---
It's the fallout of the Jessica Price/Peter Fries incident.  None of the remaining devs are going to risk their careers talking to us unless the company forces them to do so, and even then they're going to stick to the most anodyne questions possible.
---
&gt;That may be one opinion, but commercial success of games of rogue-like genre which are basically geared for inevitable failure (unless you are really lucky and exceptionally good at it) still gives me a bit of hope :) In such games, when you start a session, you're pretty much sure you'll fail to achieve the final goal (if such goal even exists in this particular game). In, like, 99% of times you'll die, often quite shortly. Still, playing such games give tons of joy, at least for certain people, both due to their rich mechanics and the challenge they offer.
---
You're comparing an MMORPG to a roguelike game. That's your first mistake -- games of different genres do things differently. It'd be like pointing at Tetris and asking 'why isn't there a boss fight?'
---
Your second mistake is assuming roguelikes are all about failure. Nope. Roguelikes are designed for the player to fail multiple times, yes -- but that is so they can *adapt and learn to win eventually*. The 99% of times you die is preparation for the 1% you don't. But you're not trying to progress. You just want to fail over and over again, you literally said it doesn't matter. No other player can tolerate this for long. 
---
&gt;So it's a fact masochists of this particular sort exist, and it's very likely some of them are present in this game as well (I'm here, after all, so why not?) Finding them is what seems to be difficult.
---
And there's a reason it's difficult.
---
Too modern. Go oldschool.
---
üñºüë®‚Äçüé®
---
&gt; a game that never touched that subject
---
oh boy here we go
---
It's the Shrine Guardian Outfit. :)
---
Yea it really has, from caithe/faolain to marjory/kasmeer, to sya, there's plenty of subtle and more overt references. 
---
Lvl 80is max lvl, but once you unlock masteries your exp goes into training masteries.
---
Once fully trained you spend mastery points to unlock and upgrade masteries. 
---
Hot maps are very similar to silvereaste and dry tops (which timewise happen just before hot)
---
There are no tasks, you talk to scouts which tell you whats going on in the area and you as a commander hop in and help the pact out.
---
Each map has its own thing going on (which make even more sense if you do maps as you progress trough the hot personal story)
---
By participating in quests and actually completing them you get rewards and map 
---
Specific "keys" .
---
You use the keys to unlock map specific caches and chests for more loot and map specific currency.
---
You spend map specific currency for map specific vendor rewards (its very similar to silverwaste events, shovels, bandit crests, bandit keys, and bandit chests).
---
After every so often the map phases into a different state, similar to dry tops sand storm.
---
In the first hot map verdant brink you gather fallen and injured pact soldiers and fortify defenses around various camps during the day. At night modrem attack the camps which you defend and after that you go trough a series of offensive events.
---
Phasing meta events reward you a massive reward at end based on the tier of your participation. So you get more and better rewards if you stick around and play more events than some guy who just joined in and simply tags events around.
---
If you Google "norn sexuality" you'll find a whole post and lengthy thread about the topic of sexuality in gw2 üòÅ

The thing I didn't notice before I made the video was, that not only Kralk's eye is missing but his entire right horn thing aswell
---
An older laptop like that with the behavior you describe leads me to think Thermal Throttling. Your GPU(or maybe CPU) is downclocking to reduce heat output before it reaches critical temps, which reduces performance.
---
Once temps drop the clock rates go back up and performance returns to normal until the heat builds up again.
---
Monitor your temperatures while you're having these FPS drops.

I'm living in Russia and don't care about this, as i know that everything can be reverse engineered, regardless of license words, leaving real only price of support/maintain.

&gt;She made some aggressive comments for sure and she shouldn't have been that way with a customer but it really wasn't that bad, I think the worst she said was someone mansplained her job to her and she called him a rando asshat, people are acting like the poor content creator was bullied by the big bad dev which really wasn't the case but she wasn't alone in the firing, another dev got fired for standing with her when the community did get out of hand, there was a lot of bad stuff that did come from the community at the time.
---
This is absolute bullshit revisionism litterally just made to defend a psychopath who put their own foot in her mouth and doubled down on it.
---
There is nobody to blame but herself. She represented the company and she started insulting people when nobody had insulted her.
---
Yes, this is a content creator being bullied by the big bad dev. The dude did nothing wrong and adored her. He approached her in the absolute model way one should approach a developer.
---
She has absolutely no leg to stand on, nor do the people defending her.
---
&gt;These people are developers their job is not to talk to the community, if they do it is welcomed if they don't want to and if they could get fired for calling someone an asshat then they don't need to.
---
It's easy to not get fired. Don't be a psychopath.
---
If this is such a massively insurmountable challenge for someone then they have bigger problems to worry about.
---
&gt;The devs have been a little more quite with the community as of late and like I put in an early comment a dev explained why we don't have dyeable weapons really well and they got a lot of comments asking the same question ignoring what they have said, and it was clear it was getting under their skin, it is easy to lose your temper especially when barraged with comments, they are only human. Have a little empathy for the devs, they are human.
---
This is more bullshit revisionism.
---
Nobody was "barraging" her with meanie poopyhead comments. The person adressing her was respectful and the previous day had made a stream talking about how much he liked her and her work.
---
I have empathy for people who deserve empathy. She was a psychopath fueled by her own ego.
---
1. Download latest release.
---
2. Unpack it into the game folder, so d912pxy folder is in game root folder. (Next to Gw2-64.exe)
---
3. Run d912pxy/install.exe
---
4. Use default install by pressing "Enter" till programm exits  
---
Which of these points are you having issues with?
---
Rename it to Incoming!
---
Incoming gave a speedboost and it make sense that it gave aegis because when you yell incoming, it means you want to guard yourself from something.
---
simply having gay characters exist in a game doesn't make it about them. It just makes it more realistic. ~~Or are you going to tell me gay people aren't real
---
~~
---
No its the best legendary backpack
---
&gt;Run d912pxy/install.exe
---
That point in particular :)
---
Deimos ranged strategy is pretty good with a rifle. Other than that I can't think of any
---
Because it's irrelevant except for people who are into ERP, or just want general attention. The former don't need public discourse for their sessions, and the latter can just piss off.
---
I mean, why not discuss housing prices of Divinity's Reach? Or the local cuisine of Soren Draa? What about mating habits of krait? Maybe some of them are gay as well. 
---
Way to play semantics, thanks üòë
---
I can't find the file after extracting the folder. I'm on a surface book 2, so it's roughly as much of a windows machine it gets xD. I get the d912pxy folder and the two folders it contains, but I can't for the love of me find a .exe file in there.
---
Is it Tyrian economy?
---
He does ^_^
---
It's equal parts measure of:
---
* Reactionary gameplay
---
* High mobility gameplay (compared to other in the genre, particularly for caster types)
---
* Wardrobe system
---
* True horizontal progression
---
There's a lot of other really great aspects, but those 4 are what get me to come back and then hook me again.
---
I mean, technically a video card driver could then be argued to be against tos :P
---
The dynamic events system. Most MMOs have a system like it now, and Anet wasn't the first to do it, but they were the first and only ones to get it right imo. Every other game makes it feel like some mini game is starting up in a tiny little circle on the map, but GW2 feels like you're a wandering adventurer stumbling on an organic and real situation with people that need your help.
---
I tried another MMO recently after some friends got into it, and WOW, I cannot believe how boring traditional questing is. Kill ten of these, go here, talk to a person, run back... GW2's hearts are sort of like this, but you can create your own objectives from like 4 options for each, and it feels like a real role playing experience even if you're just killing things or collecting items for someone. 
---
He does!
---
I've read it.
---
That policy is not enough to protect them from the negative PR caused by a tacitly approved mod that ends up causing crashes, or steals a bunch of credit cards.
---
Taking a wild guess that your antivirus swallowed it
---
Thanks, I am still kind of confused how malice works. Does it just build up over time from attacking a target? Do I have to "unleash" it to use it once it builds up?
---
My bf does the same thing, I know that game, not playing
---
Sure. Why? Ask Anet. :D
---
They're separate products and their story is sequential. Some people buy PoF to get the raptor mount in the first mission and then go back to what they were doing in the vanilla content, but if you do this, you will not experience the HoT content and the sequential story. I'd recommend getting both -- tons of content and totally worth it. However, if you just want a mount and can't get both, go with PoF (Path Of Fire). If you care more about experiencing the story sequentially, go with HoT (Heart Of Thorns). Keep in mind that the expansion purchases don't automatically unlock the living story episodes you missed for each expansion. You'll have access to those episodes for the respective expansion living world episodes going forward as long as you log in when the new releases are active, but you will most likely need to unlock the episodes you missed with gems -- also tons of content, great farming opportunities, and highly recommended, especially LWs3 episodes (Living World Season 3) for their zone-specific stories. 
---
What about a file named install? 
---
&gt;You're comparing an MMORPG to a roguelike game. That's your first mistake -- games of different genres do things differently. 
---
I'm comparing two games, first of all. And it's entirely possible to play mmorpg game a similar way and for similar reason you play rogue-like game: as long as you are interested in the game, first of all (not farming, not achievements, not fashions, not developing some masteries asap, but only in the process, i.e. the actual combat encounters, the actual gameplay), and stick with people who have the similar vision. What exactly, in your opinion, can prevent one from doing so, except for the human factor you mentioned? So far your arguments for it's not being possible tend to gravitate to the the statement that people who are doing such content won't accept me - but's that debatable and you can't know it for sure. People *you know* probably won't, but that's only because you also stick to people who share *your* vision and disposition towards the game. There can be a lot of different people with different visions somewhere out there.
---
&gt;Your second mistake is assuming roguelikes are all about failure. Nope. Roguelikes are designed for the player to fail multiple times, yes -- but that is so they can *adapt and learn to win eventually*. 
---
I've played nethack, dungeons of dredmor and synthetik many times. I haven't beaten them (or even got any close to beating them) even once. Still I couldn't care less about it, had tons of fun playing them and will continue to do so. I'm pretty much sure the hell will freeze before I'll ever beat one, realistically. Yea, I can sometimes dream about it, but that's about it. And I actually don't even need to beat them, as this won't bring me more fun than the actual process of struggling through them. Something about the journey being more important than the destination, eh? ;)
---
That said, we are not talking about never ever beating content here, just about it taking more time and effort, and facing more failures than an "effective group". So, again, except from difficulties of finding people to do it with, what could realistically prevent me from playing the game like this? The only solid argument I've heard so far is that raids are generally very strict to DPS group can put out, and simply won't allow you to proceed if your DPS is below the threshold. But it seems not the case for low-tier fractals, at least, so those should be fine for my play-stile.
---
Im playing diviner S/d 
---
It was a rhetorical question.
---
But you probably should ask anet. The worst they'd say is no.
---
Odd one for you guys:
---
I returned almost a year ago after playing at launch. I started doing zone completed for the chance at black lion keys and received absolutely no rewards beyond the "zone complete" message. 
---
So I contact support. 
---
They apologize and send me two gifts of exploration. Not what I wanted but wow holy crap. 
---
I start working on zone completes on my other character from launch. Same thing. Contact support. Another two gifts. 
---
My question is... Since I never mentioned my oldest characters names would it still be possible to get gifts of exploration from these old characters? We're these gifts made from thin air? I want to complete on my engineer while  I'm working on HOPE. 
---
I love the wardrobe too.
---
But not having a way of saving outfits is such a pain in the ass.
---
the beauty of horizontal progression :) , im going forward with each race for each armor archetype balancing genders and each character only going with one specialization to make em more unique and crazy variability :)
---
What‚Äôs a good map for PoF mastery exp? I‚Äôm assuming that like HoT doing metas is the best way to get exp, any particular location that people favor?
---
While I‚Äôm at it, are there any fun/useful rewards in these areas I can also try for? Like Ascended gear or the Anti-Branded gun that one guy trades you?
---
Depends on your traits.  
---
In general it will build up per hit (on your marked target only) each time you use a skill that requires initiative (2-5, auto attack does not spend malice). You also can gain one if you crit. You gain a max of 2 per skill use.
---
I guess with the recent update you no longer get a damage boost per malice in all your normal attacks, just your Malicious attacks (skill 1 changes when you're stealthed, into "Malicious X" in every other weapon besides rifle). In Rifle, that's +25% damage PER STACK. You can trait to up your malice stacks by 2 with Magnificent 7.

Once it builds up to max it will just sit there until you use it with a Malicious attack, the target dies, or when your Deadeye's Mark has cooled down and you target something else, then you start building it up. There's little reason to hold on to it with regular mobs. With Renewing Gaze trait your Deadeye's Mark will refresh with each kill, which keeps the Mark- Max Malice- Death's Judgement dance going.

Once again, you are not wrong that ArenaNet would never explicity approve a mod in the first place, that *would* lead to negative PR when it breaks; But the mods most people are currently using *have* been tacitly approved by this policy with the conditions that ArenaNet will **not** support them at all.
---
In fact, I believe the whole point of ArenaNet posting this policy was to clear the air about what kind of mod are not OK, while also making it clear that **any** modification (approved or not) is not their responsibility to support.

If you see objects loading in realtime, with all that no-texture behaivour: it installed and works.
---
&gt; Because it's irrelevant except for people who are into ERP, or just want general attention. 
---
Why do you get to decide that? Give me a credible source, or large sample size survey that isn't just your built in bias on the topic. 
---
What we do have however, are Anet writers explaining writing decisions in the past when it comes to the playable race sexualities. Because it's interesting to see how stuff is written in this big fantasy universe.

---
&gt; I mean, why not discuss housing prices of Divinity's Reach? Or the local cuisine of Soren Draa? What about mating habits of krait?
---
There is no reason why not. If you're interested in a thing in a game, why not discuss it on that game's reddit or forum? Find people who also care about the thing that you care about. 
---
Don't get on peoples cases for caring about stuff you don't care about :)
---
The combat.
---
The fact that everyone is on equal footing in sPVP.
---
The game's aesthetic. 
---
The ability to change your appearance for free and without having to go to an NPC
---
These are probably the main ones. I'm sure I'll think of others though
---
you can try to use dx12 mod.  If you dont like to use third party programs, you can try to install dx9 manually
---
I'm not entirely sure myself, where casual ends and hardcore starts, in this case. I used "casual" for the lack of a better term, as going full-meta heavily centered around a single most effective skill combo you build has seems like pretty hardcore to me, as it swaps part of gameplay which is important to me for higher dps counter. At the same time, I don't want to end up in groups where people running around, auto-atacking things and not willing to try something harder where they can get killed a few times, as still I would like to see *some* challenge and play it to the fullest (not going to extremes, though.)
---
Thanks for your understanding so far, you're one of the few who've actually been helpful, so far.
---
yeah i understood that, but u also need 60 branded mass per weapon, which is not as bad as at start but still quite a lot 
---
Ya I know how you feel, I‚Äôm the same but the opposite, I prefer heavy armor. Trying to get my Elementalist to where something heavier than just a T-shirt and pants, but so far have only found a set of gloves and shoulder that look like heavy armor.
---
Really wish they updated the wardrobe system to let you use any weight class, but it reverts to the original look in PvP which is the only place being able to tell at a glance what kind of armor someone has really matters.
---
hey I missed the part where there was naked Logan pictures- are you just talking about that portrait in caudecus' room?
---
People can discuss stuff all they want, they just don't need to be surprised and look after special reasons if it doesn't end up being massively upvoted.
---
Okay, thank you. So, it looks like I'm not really getting any noticable FPS benefit from it. I'll keep it running for the time being though as every bit of data helps out, I guess.
---
Every skill that consumes initiative (regardless of weapon) gives 1 malice regardless of how many times it hits the enemy. If that skill crits it gives 1 more malice for a total of 2. 
---
Malice can only be built when hitting the target marked with deadeye‚Äôs mark, but it can be expended to hit any target. 
---
Malice disappears if the marked target dies, if the mark expires overtime, or if you mark a new target. 
---
While in stealth all your weapon‚Äôs first ability changes to a stealth attack, this applies to Thief and Daredevil as well. 
---
Stealth attacks as a deadeye will consume all malice (if there‚Äôs any). Each point of malice consumed increases the stealth attack‚Äôs damage by 25%
---
You don‚Äôt lose stealth if you receive damage. If you break stealth by doing damage (be it a stealth or any other attack) you lose stealth and become revealed by 3 seconds. Revealed prevents entering stealth again during its duration. If stealth ends naturally (runs out, snd you don‚Äôt attack) you don‚Äôt get revealed and can stealth again right away. 
---
Against weak enemies just kneel, mark, and spam 3. Unless you‚Äôre severely undergeared they will die before you hit max malice
---
Against veteran and + monsters you will do the same kneel3 spam then F2 at max malice to stealth then stealth attack pressing 1
---
Traits:
---
First tier: change traits depending if you fight packs of monsters or not. Malicious Intent for small groups pf mobs or single target. Collateral Damage when fighting large groups of mobs. 
---
Second tier: silent scope
---
Third tier maleficent seven for monsters with high health. For example a hero point, hydras, djins, basically anything you won‚Äôt burst down in kneel3 spam + stealth attack at 5 malice. Having 7 malice means +50%dmg to stealth attack. Reaching 7 malice also gives a lot of initiative back so you just spam kneel3 until 7 malice then stealth attack rinse and repeat because you will never run out of initiative. Against weak mobs take be quick or be killed and they will just get deleted
---
Listen to what this guys says lol
---
Open world rifle melts any monster even those pesky hydras or djins in path of fire. Rifle only struggles against groups of mobs. When that happens just weapon swap to dagger and dagger. If it‚Äôs too risky to stay kneeled with rifle, for example doing bounties, use pistol pistol and dagger dagger
---
Also, copy pasting my other comment
---
Gambling. Also i hate guild wars because it got me into gambling.
---
You can buy it on trading post as a named weapon. Pretty sure it's on wiki.
---
Yeah I wasn't sure if it wanted the weapon or the skin. The wiki didn't specify anywhere either, although it did list the skin as part of the collection, it also listed the weapon called Mordant Edge as part of the collection.

No, I actually play this game for 6 years. But I did not play when both DLCs came out, just came back a month ago.
---
Why so passive aggresive?
---
Why so much guild which I would like to join are always have to be NA guilds? :) I'm in EU tz, unfortunately, so unless your prime hours lie within 11am - 2am EU time (3am - 5pm CST, if I'm not mistaken), it won't be possible, unfortunately. Sorry for the offer, though, it helps to know there are still communities like that in the game.
---
I just wondered because there are quest on the PoF Maps.
---
... these all seem like sarcastic responses 
---
Probably the various LS4 metas, especially Istan and the current ones in Thunderhead Keep. PoF doesn't have many metas events like HoT does, but PoF's Mastery XP requirements are much lower than HoT Mastery XP.
---
&gt; I'm comparing two games, first of all. And it's entirely possible to play mmorpg game a similar way and for similar reason you play rogue-like game: as long as you are interested in the game, mostly (not farming, not achievements, not fashions, not developing some masteries asap, but only in the process, i.e. the actual combat encounters, the actual gameplay), and stick with people who have the similar vision. What exactly, in your opinion, can prevent one from doing so, except for the human factor you mentioned? So far your arguments for it's not being possible tend to gravitate to the the statement that people who are doing such content won't accept me - but's that debatable and you can't know it for sure. People you know probably won't, but that's only because you also stick to people who share your vision and disposition towards the game. There can be a lot of different people with different visions somewhere out there.
---
No, you can't just take one game and compare it to another for the sake of comparing. I could take Dead Space and compare it to GW2 and then shit on GW2 by saying 'why doesn't this game has dismemberment as a feature'. I could, but it's a bad argument to make, because games of different genres attempt to do things differently and the absence of Game A's feature in Game B doesn't make the latter bad. And your 'comparison' also requires you to throw out so many aspects of GW2 that matter in order to make a comparison -- how is that fair?
---
My argument has never been about it being impossible, but very unlikely, as I stated in a previous comment. Yes, you could very well find the players you seek, and enjoy the game with 4 or 9 other people like that. It isn't impossible. But eventually, some of them are going to want to progress, because what's the point of failure for failure's sake? And that is *exactly* what you want, given that you don't care about progression.
---
I can't know for sure, like you said. But I can make an educated guess, because I've played longer than you have, and because I've seen people like you in my guild try to do exactly that. Hint: The groups that did that ended up breaking up eventually. 
---
&gt;I've played nethack, dungeons of dredmor and synthetik many times. I haven't beaten them (or even got any close to beating them) even once. Still I couldn't care less about it, had tons of fun playing them and will continue to do so. I'm pretty much sure the hell will freeze over before I'll ever beat any of those, realistically. Yea, I can sometimes dream about it, but that's about it. And I actually don't even need to beat them, as this won't bring me more fun than the actual process of struggling through them. Something about the journey being more important than the destination, eh? ;)
---
Your inability to beat a game doesn't mean it is unbeatable, given that others have. And quoting the Stormlight Archive to me isn't going to make reality change. You may have fun, but will others? Because the moment they stop having fun, and you refuse to adapt, either they'll leave, or you get booted. 
---
&gt;That said, we are not talking about never ever beating content here, just about it taking more time and effort, and facing more failures than an "effective group". So, again, except from difficulties of finding people to do it with, what could realistically prevent me from playing the game like this? The only solid argument I've heard so far is that raids are generally very strict to DPS group can put out, and simply won't allow you to proceed if your DPS is below the threshold. But it seems not to be the case for low-tier fractals, at least, so those should be fine for my play-stile.
---
Cool. Then you'll probably learn in a few months' time why the meta builds are meta builds, or end up tweaking your super duper awesome non-meta build to something you think is super duper awesome non-meta as well, but is just an imitation of the meta builds. Nobody cares about low-tier fractals. You can go in there with 5 people on Nomad's gear and still do it fine. But that's not what we talk about when we talk about 'endgame content'. 
---
I've said everything I needed to say, and anything else will just be repeating myself. So I'm going to leave this conversation now, and I would appreciate if you didn't write a long-ass reply I'm not going to reply to anyway. Cheers.
---
Thief staff didn't exist for Dry Top and Silverwastes ;P
---
The animations (overall. I still hate the female animations with two handed weapons), how smooth the combat and movements feel, the model designs. You don't need more to make something enjoyable. I know the balancing is a complete mess but the core gameplay is solid enough that I don't want to stop. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Lost_Badge_Dulfy_translation_table.jpg
---
I still love this world, all QoL we have, combat, but episodes are just not enough for me. 
---
I'm able to finish most of it in a week, just playing after work (i skip on collections, aka weapons i can't use/don't like).
---
This is the only way for me to enjoy it at the moment, and i don't even know if there will be more expansions (i really prefer it that way, instead of ls episodes, at least i have a choice, in what i want to do, different map, etc).
---
Pointless distinction.
---
balancing is a fool's errand that will never ever reach a state that is acceptable to anyone. 
---
the most balanced games are the most boring. there's no reason to pick anything. every choice is hollow and meaningless. everything is equally good. the gameplay and meta is extremely boring as a result.
---
but you idiots want that. no fucking wonder the game is dying.
---
Raise!
---
P7 will be here as it do his job on logging, metrics and such.
---
You can do another logging bicycle and contribute on github if you THAT concerned.
---
If you need an in-game reason, consider that the Path of Fire maps take place in areas inhabited by people, be they Vabbians or Kournans or Olmakhan.  The Heart of Thorns maps aren't inhabited by any playable races, they're warzones.  Like Orr, we're much more focused on establishing military footholds and destroying dragon minions than we are helping the locals.  By and large, except for the Hylek tribes and Exalted, the locals want to kill us.
---
So you leave a *long-ass reply* of your own, and strip all joy of leaving mine own from me at the same time? How incredibly thoughtful of you! XD Nevertheless, I don't see any good coming from this conversation either. Yet, a few points just need to be addressed here (you may not answer them, if you wish, or change your mind and put another *long-ass reply*, I don't care).
---
First of all, it's not about specific features, it's a quality of gameplay. If you need to just repeatedly hit one button to proceed, it's a straight awful gameplay, regardless of a genre and year when this atrocity was published. Thus if some environment reduces your options in a particular game situation to a bare minimum (like, you have 20 skills available to you, but only is force to use 3 of them 95% of the time) - it's much worse kind of gameplay that one which allows you to use all 20 - at least it is like this for me. It's all about variety, diverse experience and freedom to execute your play in a lot of difference way, what **always** have been a measure of a good, engaging game design.
---
Thus, again, you can compare games with different genres, like, for example, you can say that Heavy Rain is a bad game (hardly even a game, actually) than Mortal Combat - simply because MK gives you ton of gameplay, and HR is just an interactive movie with a bit of occasional game-like moments.
---
&gt;Your inability to beat a game doesn't mean it is unbeatable, given that others have.
---
Well, there were those people who put down raid and fractal bosses in solo play, so what? Is everybody ever trying raids and fractals must aim to achieve the same now? What is your point here? There are not goals in both of those games except ones you set for yourself. If you want to dedicated your life to beating the Nethack - go for it. But most of the people will just keep playing it as a un-beatable game they just enjoy to play.
---
&gt; But that's not what we talk about when we talk about 'endgame content'.
---
Apparently that's not what you call "endgame content", but from a logical standpoint it is one - you can reach it only after hitting levelcap in this game. There rest is subjective, and every player sets his limits for themselves. In my case, I don't see much point aiming for anything higher than that.
---

---
It's like people aren't allowed to play how they want to. Who died and made you king?
---
&gt; Your definition of being "hot shit" is being able to dodge
---
No, *my* definition of "hot shit" is when people like you need to pad your egos and pathetic epeens by making obnoxious posts like these without thinking about the consequences.
---
As for what I've done, it might be being someone who has decency. But I doubt you even know what that means, judging by your actions :^)
---
To me, the single one thing that I adore this game for is the helpful community. I've heard bad things about fractal groups(something I personally do at all), but in open world and in chat I usually find the average player more helpful and friendly than in other mmos. There are way more things I love this game for, but the community is my number 1 thing if I have to be honest
---
- The lore (it is extensive, but not overwhelming. given enough time, you can grasp it really well and that is a nice feeling to have when it comes to telling your own stories and anticipating new ones) 
---
- Tyria/the world design (of all MMO worlds I have visited, Tyria isn't the most warm and comfortable, but it's certainly the most stunning, rich, and beautiful. There is so much love and stunning scenery in every new map they put out.)
---
- Sylvari (I love so many things about this race and feel very connected to them, they are among my favorite races in any fantasy setting ever) 
---
- Mounts (the things they make possible are amazing, they allow for even bolder map design (see Thunderhead Peaks) and other mechanical stuff.
---
- Levelling (I have my gripes with the event system, but one thing I love is that every playthrough is automatically different because of how and when and where events spring up, and because of how many choices you have. I don't play terribly much, so I still find new things, and things I have forgotten).
---
- Jumping Puzzles (I have done all of them by now, and it makes me sad that we aren't currently getting any new ones. I also wish there was more of an incentive to do them. That being said, I just love that they exist. Many of them are very fun and it just feels so adventurous to hop around in old ruins or on giant mushrooms or on holopads... awesome!) 
---
- Elite Specs (I get that there are balance issues, but I  don't get how Elite Specs never receive the praise they deserve! Other MMOs give their classes two new skills per expansion and maybe one new class every second one. Meanwhile GW2 has 9 core classes with 18 elite specs and likely 9 more to come, and no one ever talks about this except for when a new player inquires... it makes me mad, sometimes.)
---
- Shared Nodes (People who just casually snatch a resource away from under your hands are a reason I feel like players are enemies in other MMO open worlds. In GW2, I never have to worry about this, and I love it)
---
- Alt-Friendliness (I love it. I do a lot of character RP in my head, and there is nothing more tiring than a boring levelling and gearing journey on several alts I want to add to the family, so GW2 is kind of perfect. FFXIV also has a great system, though)
---
- Festivals (I love the flavor each festival brings to the game, except maybe for LNY, which has the least effort put into) 
---
- Story (I know it's not stellar, but ever since HoT, I constantly find myself excited about what might happen next and where. It's an entertaining story and I care(d) about Aurene and all characters they have made an effort with recently. Taimi in particular.) 
---
- No Gear treadmill (I sometimes wish loot would feel more exciting in GW2, but if it is the price for not having my gear rendered useless every two years, I pay it!) 
---
All in all it's an outfit like the gemstore outfits, even though it doesn't look so fancy. It's actually pretty simple.
---
In the early years GW2 had a different wardrobe system, also "outfits" were different. At this time every character got town clothes, standard race clothes. With the new wardrobe/outfit system these town clothes (and some other clothes as well) were transformed into tonics. I guess it's a year now, since then it's possible to exchange these tonics into actual outfits. While all other tonics became really expensive with this change (well, they were gemstore items as well before), the town clothes stood cheap. 
---
Also, if you look a bit to the future, you can get another outfit for candy corn at Halloween.
---
They could as well have misunderstood each other. Anyway, getting on her high horse because of that was not the smartest move. Could've defused easily, as said above.
---
Moreover, be careful not to use argument from authority too much. Even experts can discuss with other people, and be wrong/not think about something.
---
Get some friends or join an active guild and try to be part of it. Otherwise, if the feeling of burnout is there don‚Äôt resist it, take a break. I‚Äôm on my like, 10th (and final) break as the game just isn‚Äôt for me after 6.5 long years. 
---
Wasn't this guy a keylogger?? Alright son
---
i7 8700K here and I have to say that everything runs smoothly even in WvW with full map blobs fighting each other.
---
Honestly not much anymore. Anet keeps making something and instead of improving it, they completely bail on it. Everything from path of fire just seems half assed. From the story to the metas to the elite specs. Design wise the game as a whole suffers from this too. Balance patches are all over the place. They introduce things that are never expanded on like SAB. Wvw is an after thought. PVP is in shambles. And their attempt at eSports was laughable. The old Anet made this game and the new Anet can't keep it going. Collin leaving was the canary in the coal mine dying. 
---
I just play when I feel like it and don't when I don't \o/
---
Lol it's a small world, I just saw you asking about this in the map chat.
---
I played for the first time through all the season 4 maps after Ep.5 came out and none of them were died out, all of them were very populated. But I can see how they can die out faster then then HoT maps. 
---
I really enjoy the combat system and the gameplay of every class' meta build. The raids are really good in this game too. Even though I've done them thousands of times, i still get excited and look forward to my weekly full clear on Monday night and drunk raids on the weekends. 
---
I'm happy it worked , take care =)
---
hehe :D
---
Did not say it is not playable. It is "just" dammit impractical for most bosses and therefore not recommended... and absolutly no fun. 
---
I loathe anti-vaxxers and honestly think they should be imprisoned for endangering children. 
---
But... OP, this isn't the right place to meme about anti-vaxxers. And it's not funny either.
---
You can get good xp by collecting volatile magic in thunderhead keep. Go south to the dredge heartand follow the volatile magic over the water with your skimmer. Repeat with alts as you like. There are also some maguc line in the air for the griffon or with gliding.
---
Diversity if activities. Lately it has been easy for me as i cannot play to long time but when i played for more i just had a list of what i like to do in the game and did a bit of everything and never no-lifed just one of them. Even when doing legendaries etc i just took my time.   
---
meh you should add \[Nerdish\] tag....
---
You've certainly received your moneys worth!
---
T3 is a bit weird, most people that are in T3 are still learning the fractals and it is the point that fractals start actually being challenging content for unorganized groups. T3 was designed for teaching the more difficult mechanics needed for T4 so it where you should learn them.
---
To make it easier on your own part make sure you are using a meta build on a class you understand, use the fractal potions you get from the daily recs, you always get 1 of each. Omnipot is a great QOL goal for someone who hasn't got it yet.
---
As for your groups, if you are pugging it is luck of the draw, try and join a group that has a dedicated healer + boon spammer, (or play one of these classes yourself) it will make it a lot easier.  F+P means food and potions which is often a requirement people make to join their group, this is often the only requirement to join a T4 group (which is why omnipot is so great). If you take the plunge and start doing T4s then you'll find that the groups will generally be better than at T3 with veteran players that often have the potential to carry a group if it is struggling.
---
Another option is joining a guild where you don't have to PUG and your teammates will be more forgiving of inexperience.
---
If you are having trouble with a specific fractal then Deroir has a great series explaining each fractal.
---
Lucky.
---
You're playing a better game than your team.
---
Could be an announcement for a feature coming in 2021, who knows.

Great, I was unaware that ArenaNet has made other official statements approving specific mods. That's great news for the users of those mods, but this policy still applies to **all** third party modifications and it really doesn't matter whether a mod is acknowledged by ArenaNet or not.
---
This policy clearly states that ArenaNet **can not** support mods, under any circumstances, as they give no exceptions to this policy within the policy itself. This is a completely fair and normal stance for a game developer to take and there is no logical argument here that ArenaNet approving a mod obliges them to support that mod as well.
---
I take really long breaks.
---
Well it contains the models you used on your character and can compile them, so **theoretically** yes
---
The ascended light armor is decently armorish. Expensive, but at least it doesn't have a bare midriff...

Holy shit did you notice his decap and the cooldowns on the other guy? Nice attempt to discredit very strong coping strategy lmfao
---
Posting a time without a time zone on an international forum is as useful as opening a window and yelling the same message.
---
I guess I don't binge reddit enough as I haven't seen it before. Oh well, I'm a big reposteroni.
---
Hands down the best part of GW2 is the lack of gear treadmill. I can take a break from the game for five or six months when I get burned out. When I come back I know that my gear is still relevant and the most I'll have to do is swap out my runes/sigils because of a balance patch.
---
I know people who took a break from other MMO's and they were already burnt out again by the time they caught their gear/max level up.
---
So basically you're calling people who respect other peoples' ways of playing the game how they want to, candy asses. Gotcha. 
---
You don't need "to be" the most cancerous piece of shit, you already achieved that. 
---
Never having to rely on others for heals.
---
&gt; Big hype was made about alliances, and now that I think about it... I don't really care very much. It won't really make me want to play WvW more, command more, or be more invested in it. All it really does is just rotate who I am fighting, and who is fighting by my side. It doesn't really give me a reason to fight anymore.
---
The delay in implementation has itself been an issue in this regard.
---
Yes. They should tell. I won't find excuses for the behaviors in this thread, just explaining.
---
Uhm... you didn't play GW1, did you?
---
Making effectively all skills open to all characters through the secondary profession system, and adding hundreds of skills to that pool per expansion left the game with an absolute disaster of a balancing mess. There were combinations which were just crazy OP, right next to ones that were completely useless.  And any tweak to a skill meant thinking about 1000 combinations it would affect... 
---
End result: lack of balance, leaving some ideas OP and others nonviable.
---
Attacking while moving, and the story.
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Armor you can earn game wont loot as good as gemstore cus anet needs all money they can get :)
---
Hello, it's arena net update here. Kralky will eat mists soon, so for better immersion we are removing WvW and PvP game modes. Have fun exploring open world folks!
---
I have a character or two to completely call "mine". They're characters I pay attention to the story for, do map completion while paying attention to the tiny details.
---
I do have a character that is geared just enough for fractals so I can still run them with friends.
---
Made an illustration of my main group a year or so back. Don't like it anymore, so I decided to make another one. 
---
I'd love it if you could transmog to any class. I want some chainmail pieces on my char ranger, or some of the cape-ish shoulders on my guardian. 
---
Anet needs to take a note from Diablo 3 in that aspect. 
---
Id say go for armor in game. You might find an outfit you enjoy, and if so, feel free to buy/use it.
---
I personally really like some of the prestige-y armors like carapace/luminescent armor from silverwastes, and requiem armor from season4
---
Thanks! Maybe it was on tumblr - I dusted it off a few nights ago and posted it there. Also, the overall composition on this is original, but I'm re-using some of the poses off of these sketches I made recently:

I also think there is an outside chance the announcement is for a battle royale mode that is in development.
---
Yes sir/ma‚Äôam! But I had to take the opportunity to explore outside the arena :) 
---
Two years of improvement!? Hot damn.
---
Also, how long did it take to draw those?
---
Usually not just the skin for these kinds of things. Found out that the hard way with legendary crafting. 
---
Went back and re-watched, looking for CDs.
---
* Looks like you did need to use shadow step + steal to stop the decap.  You should have had heal up, which is an advantage to you (as Sind is on a 10s CD at the start of the fight). 
---
* You stole to Sind but he was able to evade it. He then got off a steal on to you without you evading it. (To your credit, he did miss his second steal, but you didn't attempt a second steal?)
---
* You both had signet of agility up and in fact you had it up for the entire fight. So I'm not sure what you're talking about there.
---
* And to your first point about him 'double losing'. Look at the score and the map. You're down 70 points at the start of the fight, but on a double cap. You have a necro 1v2ing necro+ ranger at stillness, and a warrior+guard inexplicably 1v2ing and not winning vs guard on mid. You were forced to rotate reactively and had to choose between either giving up a decap or giving up stillness and potentially your necro (for the record the necro did manage to stay up it seems). Maybe stillness was always lost and you made the right call, but I'm not so sure as staff thief can pressure light/mediums pretty well.
---
If I had to guess, your team lost this game ultimately (which would not be your fault). But this was definitely a pivotal moment where your team could have made some significant gains to even the game, and they didn't.
---
Well I don't play that way, but again,  you have to weigh against is failing over and over again fun. The kind of casual audience you're asking about is also the same casual audience that's not going to like losing over and over again.
---
My guild doesn't generally insist on meta builds and many people don't run them. We get through dungeons and low level fractals just fine. We don't get through T4 Fractals that fine, unless we have enough people with enough knowledge to carry through the people who can't keep up, which are most of those people. 
---
But I can do T4 fractals and I can keep up and I don't always use meta builds. HOWEVER, I also have a good build. I don't use a rotation. But I know my character and my build and my skills, and I know what I need to cast when.
---
Meta builds aren't as necessary has having good builds that work that you know how to play. If you don't want to play with a rotation, don't do it. But don't expect to find a guild of people who play just like that. Find a group that doesn't mind YOU playing like that. That's the best advice I can give you.
---
I'll never use a hard rotation or a meta build unless I find it fun. I just have very little interest in raiding because it's not my thing.
---
Generally the people most interested in raiding are going to want to A) Win and B) Win quickly so they can play more raids and get more loot.
---
Those who are left are still going to want to win. Getting into a group with a bunch of casuals all with their own builds makes it harder to win.
---
Meta builds are not there because they're the "best" builds. But because they're the agreed upon builds the community uses so you don't have to talk for ten hours before a raid to make sure all your bases are covered. You know what you need, you have those roles filled and you go.
---
You'd need to find a static group that accepts you and your build. But the casuals who'll just take anyone are a whole less likely to beat raids and therefore a whole less likely to keep raiding and that's where your problem lies. You may find doing what you want fun, but 10 people doing what they want is not going to win, and losing is probably less fun for more people.
---
If it‚Äôs locked and says spend 200 gems to unlock, you don‚Äôt own it. If it is locked but you don‚Äôt see 200 gems but just to purchase the expansion, I believe you should have that episode once you get the expac.
---
I like the first one a lot more but I can see the improvements, well done :o 
---
Dont rush thru things, or grind out things in the smallest amount of time.
---
this looks so nice! i love it
---
You are a undead, easy.
---
Holo and spellbreaker are totally viable, the latter being used in fractals almost daily. Spellbreaker as a main spec kind of sucks in PvE for PvP reasons. However, when its a boon day in fractals, you have your BS go spellbreaker to strip protection. Though you may mean non-BS spellbreaker, which aint happening until they do something about how strong 2x banners are to a group/raid.
---
Engi is a core profession, and almost all of those are just far outshadowed by elite specs--warrior as BS being the exception. The elites just give too much a dps and/or utility increase to use pure core specs.
---
Scrapper, well, that one I do agree on. It was somewhat strong at release since the 1million step rotation, for those who could do it, would pump out a ton of DPS, and it was able to solo break CC bars like nobodies business. It was another target of PvE nerfs for PvP reasons. But it also suffered from some power creep in other classes/specs, which when put together with a crazy rotation, made it pretty bad.
---
A problem here isnt just that these specs are bad (which, some of them are for several or all purposes), but also that some of the specs you mentioned are flat out OP--mirage pumps out stupid dps on several bosses...its even one of the few condi classes that are accepted in fractal CMs.
---
Fullclear monday mornings
---
I have to play devil's advocate because I think most of your points are really weak. I'm probably gonna get downvoted since I'm on this game's sub after all but I very much enjoy this game regardless of what I'm about to say.
---
&gt; World completion is genuine exploration, filled with little moments of coolness and discovery.
---
The world does have awesome things to explore but World Completion will have you skip over the most cool stuff (majority Jumping Puzzles and little secrets/easter eggs have nothing to do with map completion).
---
&gt; The meta only matters in very specific circumstances. You really can roll your own build and play how you want for most of the game.
---
This is true of basically every game unless you are going for world firsts and whatnot.
---
&gt; The story is, mostly, pretty good. It feels like it's actually improving over time. I feel like it's probably going to grind Taimi up and make you wear her tears as armour at some point, but lordy lord has she developed as a character since her first introduction.
---
This is personal preference so I'm not gonna argue against you but personally the story did not grab me at all and is much weaker than GW1's.
---
&gt; The HoT maps and metas are outstanding in their design.
---
HoT maps are incredible, much better than PoF which is a shame. Aside from some mistakes (like creating the centaur leather farm) which didn't help the economy, the devs DO make a really good job in this department.
---
&gt; The Path of Fire scenery design is beautiful.
---
Personal preference but I agree.
---
&gt; Mounts are da bomb.
---
This game DOES have the best mounts gameplay-wise. It sucks that visually it's pay-wall central though.
---
Makes sense, we're technically full of skeletons.
---
I'm playing Scrapper pretty well in WvW and PvP.
---
PvE tho...... :c
---
Ah, good old perma tank times.
---
I quite like the female human voice actor.  I think she has excellent range and delivery.  
---
That being said, I generally found the story and overall direction of Heart of Thorns to be terrible.  Most of the voice actors gave very ‚Äúconfused performances‚Äù in Heart of Thorns.  I largely attribute this to Heart of Thorns not knowing what it wanted to be in terms of story.  It is very hard to get a good performance out of an actor when the script and direction isn‚Äôt up to scratch.  
---
I‚Äôm glad they managed to turn things around in Path of Fire.  The script, voice acting and general direction was really well done in Path of Fire.  I especially like how Canach was written as the ‚Äúcomedic relief‚Äù in Path of Fire and the voice actor rose to the occasion.  
---
DLGamer is one of the game's official retailers
---
#nOt EnOuGh HeAlTh
---
March (around spring break) generally has a sale, and August (anniversary) also generally has a sale. They also can go on sale when a new living world episode comes out 
---
And as /u/MorbidEel said, dlgamer is a great site. It's not like Cdkeys or G2a, it's an actual registered retailer for ArenaNet (see list of retailers [here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#UnitedStates-physical). 
---
Only condi holo in vg... and i can't use engineer anymore. 
---
DH is stronger than holo, i can do more dps with DH with a boring rotation in power wings, thats why i should use DH instead of holo.
---
Yeah, because making all weapons available would bring soo much variety. 
---
Ever looked at the weapons we already have? How many of them are used per class? Right, we have some meta weapons and the rest is "useless fun stuff". New weapons maybe would only bring more "useless fun stuff", but no improvement to the game.
---
Balance implications aside, this is adorable
---
They don't have the vocal cords to have a feminine voice.
---
Imagine that a lion could speak one day.
---
Yea that's how it'll sound like.
---
Getting my ass beat in wvw.
---
And beating asses in return.
---
Can you please share the tools used to make this?
---
As a late adopter, this is an answer I'm happy to see. Thank you and keep up the good work!
---
Sounds like this could very well be the issue. 
---
There should be black spots above your health orb, they light up as you accumulate malice.
---
The base amount is capped at 5, with a trait it can be made 7.
---
You gain 1 malice by hitting with skills that cost initiative, 2 points if you crit.
---
It is only gained towards whoever you have marked, and it enhances your stealth attacks, so hover over those to see the effect.
---
Your new stolen items will grant you stealth if used at 5 or more malice, so learn to utilize that.
---
And try reading all your traits to see how they synergize together.
---
Trash are meant to be sold to fund Copper Fed Salvage Kits
---
malice is a special deadeye feature, represented by the red orbs right above your endurance bar. Certain traits and skills make use of malice, and you generate malice by spending initiative when you have a target marked (Deadeye's mark, F1).
---
The biggest use of malice is that when you are stealthed, your 1 skill becomes a special stealth skill that uses your malice as a resource. The more malice you have, the more damage the stealth skill does
---
Ah okay thanks for that, I wasn't sure just because the front page talking about 100% secure transactions and user reviews about getting keys didn't build my confidence much.
---
High level content is earned, not guaranteed. The game expects you to practice and improve before succeeding at high level content. Most end game content is aimed at the community that wants a challenge, that wants their abilities tested, and wants success to be earned.
---
It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that content is locked behind progress. If you want to fight the epic raid boss Dhuum, you need to defeat the challenging trials before him.
---
I‚Äôd recommend changing your mindset from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to progress‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine with slow progress‚Äù. There are plenty of casual groups that fit this description.
---
That's like saying a merchant isn't allowed to sell a product and buy more stock at the same time, are you mad?
---
What a jackass
---
That's like prime time on the other side of the world. Unless you're in EU wherein most players are in neighboring countries and the time variance isn't as wide.
---
Exactly he had the superior team members. But i was superior to him. Proven by the duel that both started with full hp and equal cd‚Äôs. So it was a fair 1v1 and he lost the duel and didnt decap.  even when he had advantage by not having to defend a node ( which was an handicap for me, cuz it didnt allow for me to chase him freely, untill hes dead) so he could move freely to create openings for himself to engage while i was staying inside node. But alas even that didnt help him win the duel.
---
actually imo it shouldnt matter where in the mists kralkatorrik is - mists is not the all. if he is not in the all, world should be imbalanced. i don't think it's stated anywhere that "being in the mists that are close to tyria" (is that even a thing) counts as being in the all
---
There are more skeletons on Earth than living humans!!
---
What part of that post is disconnected with reality?
---
The short term profit driven mindset of the games industry at large, Anet included?
---
Or that it a native solution isn't easy to implement?
---
That the devs would probably like to see it happen? Because that's been my experience talking with devs in general. They want what's best for the game, and feel for a lot of community suggestions - but a lot of the time, they don't get to decide what gets worked on.
---
I may have written that post when I was annoyed and sleep deprived, and it obviously shows, but it was an attempt to have a real dialogue and propose an alternative explanation. Not that Anet was just lying, nor was the difficulty of implementation the whole story. Yeah, it would have been a technical challenge, and that's not really disputable. But the games industry solves technical challenges all the time, and this one is clearly solvable. It almost certainly isn't impossible like a lot of fanboys make it out to be. So why haven't they solved it?
---
Because there's no immediate return for the cost.
---
That is the crux of the whole post. "Game company makes bad decision based off of short sighted greed. More news at 11." The overwhelming short sighted greed of the game industry seems like one of the few things most gaming communities can almost universally agree on. So I have to say, I'm kinda surprised that I ate such shit.
---
I guess I can only attribute that to trying to articulate that point when I was annoyed and very tired. Or, you know, I'm just a delusional moron. Could go either way.
---
As someone who has heard many 50-something hillbilly chain smokers, I don't know what you're talking about. Female charr sound great, esp compared to some of the other gender/race combos.
