&gt;1.While playing Guild Wars 2, you must respect the rights of others and their rights to play and enjoy the Game. To this end, you may not defraud, harass, threaten, embarrass or cause distress and/or unwanted attention to other players. This includes posting insulting, offensive, or abusive comments about players, repeatedly sending unwanted messages, reporting players maliciously, attacking a player based on race, sexual orientation, religion, heritage, etc. Hate speech is not tolerated.
---
---
---
Yep 
---
Read through her Mictrotransaction Design Primer. She made some really good points. Before people rant over her because they read "Microtransactions", they should read a bit in her manual.
---
And my argument is that anything they allow the game itself to render on-screen, as well as any sound they allow the game to play, clearly *also* is intended to be perceived by the player. Ergo analysing, magnifying and re-rendering specific elements only uses things that are *intended* to be accessed even if you hook an entire heavy-duty neural net to it.
---
The issue of course is that this use case clearly is **not** intended and in fact outright prohibited under the various "unfair advantage" clauses by any stretch. But then TacO and any similar program must also be judged by the same rules, and ANet haven't elaborated on what specifically counts as "unfair" or an "advantage". Chest trail and JP overlays definitely let you play better than any alternative which doesn't interface with APIs. So basically any TacO-level tool in my eyes requires explicit clarification because the stated rules are too broad.
---
Yeah, it's terrible how it had to be that way so you can properly moderate. Hope you enjoyed it nonetheless.
---
There has been at least one other post about it already.
---
The new SA is my favourite instability and I'm having a lot of fun with it.
---
r/communistpropaganda
---
But the guy is right, it's not particularly subtle at all. And considering the influence from certain individuals on that episode, I'd wager it was an intentional "HEY LOOK GUYS I PUT GAY PEOPLE IN THE GAME" gesture. Which isn't unprecedented either in GW2 for that matter.
---
Personally, my view of "subtle" would be Director Jim Miller from Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. A character that is a human being first and foremost, rather than a token gay representation shoe-in. You can discover his backstory when searching his apartment through emails and photos.
---
We hoped to kill Kralky so Aurene could soak up the magic and be a nice elder dragon
---
You missed the fact that Aurene was supposed to take Kralk's place.
---
‚Äúone taught me love‚Äù but there‚Äôs three NPCs there? ü§î
---
The idea was that Aurene would absorb the magic let out by Kralkatorrik's death, keeping the magical balance stable
---
Most underrated mentor.
---
Fair enough, the rewind is faster and more fun for me but staying on the mount the whole is definitely easier, but either way doesn't make up for the folks that don't even use the spears in the first place. :\
---
The 9900k is not only soldered but its IHS is gold plated whereas the 8700k/8086k has neither of these things that help reduce temps meaning that the 9900k is able to oc higher than both chips naturally. I don't know where you got the idea that an 8086k could oc higher.
---
https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3421-intel-i7-9700k-review-benchmark-vs-8700k-and-more
---
Take note that the difference between the stock 9900k and the 9900k running at 5.2ghz is 10 fps or less. Even the 9700k is dominating the 5ghz 8700k at stock frequency.
---
https://youtu.be/kmAWqyHdebI stock 9900k outperforming 8700k in cinebench.
---

---
https://www.anandtech.com/show/12945/the-intel-core-i7-8086k-review/14 5ghz 8086k single thread score in cinebench is 219 and the stock 9900k scores 220 as seen here https://www.pcper.com/reviews/Processors/Intel-Core-i9-9900K-Review-Competition-Renewed/Media-Rendering-and-Encoding
---
Then you can compare the multithread cinebench benchmarks and see the huge gap between a stock 9900k and a 5ghz 8086k. There's also benches for the 8086k at 5.2ghz too and guess what? 9900k still outperforms it.
---
I hope there is a future elite spec which is based of the Olmakhan‚Äôs magic!
---
I wish Balthazar was still here, he is awesome :(
---
Oh no. Oh no no no.
---
it does that on a lot of armors, and I would highly prefer the weapon to clip into the armor than this, floating around my character
---
jUsT buY mOrE baNk TaBS
---
But how do I do that? I reported him for verbal abuse but I doubt anything is going to be done about it.
---
oh ok, when did we discuss this in the story?
---
He's wearing the male Wedding Attire Outfit. Each race has a different version when they wear it.
---
I had a lot of fun with it today. It's fun with friends, it's maybe annoying with some randoms that just want to rush through.
---
The drawing at 1:43 made me tear up, so good job.
---
I am not even saying that she is the better character, just that she isn't a generic NPC from what has been established so far, and not a wash. It's true that it's too early for any other major judgements, but I would lie if I said I weren't keen on seeing more of her. 
---
Wow.... just wow. I was irritated so hard by it but only niticed in the comments. You need a medal.
---
Little aurene was cute, teenage aurene is cute during cutscene, but in open world she's not that cute at all, so yeah no
---
But there were probably ripped apart by risen... slowly...
---
To be honest, I'd rather have the brutal deaths that I can't just rub back to life instead something like Demmi who was shot once and then just sat there for a long time bleeding out in a world full of magic. Now before you go "BUT IT WAS A BLOODSTONE INFUSED BULLET!!!" Anet could have then at least put the effort into either giving her a bloodstone debuff or visual effect, but without those it just looks like she bled out from a single gun shot while surrounded by healers.
---
Yay was waiting for these.
---
because 6 months from now, the map will be dead and all the metas that you need to beat 10-20 times will fail every time
---
My opinion will probably be unpopular, but my guildies and I cleared every boss first try. There is, in fact, a safe place right beside the mislock to stack at the first boss, we did all the bomb and orb mechanics just fine at Artastiiv, and no one died at all during Arkk, even when parts of the platform disappeared. Despite also having sugar rush, we didn't feel so much of a difference, cleared it almost as fast as we normally did, and had more fun than we normally do during our daily runs. Sure, we had to change up our gameplay slightly, but it made the run more interesting.
---
All I'd want them to do to old dungeons is prevent people from being able to one shot Lupicus, and to rectify the fact that he instantly resets when he approaches the right/left of the entrance to his big arena. They fucked shit up with AI over the years, I've noticed all bosses in the game move faster and differently when you walk in their hitbox and I'm assuming it had something to do with raids.
---
And for the fallen god we did a Dragon ball and got a power up then came back and killed him
---
Mount skins all have cute requirements?   News to me.
---
I guess typing is the only option.
---
did not have a balance patch yet. That's what I meant. I have a corrector who makes me more wrong than correcting.
---
It should be very clear by now that ANET do not make design mistakes. They have a long history of not admitting to ideas that just weren't good and probably has a lot to do with thier lack of learning from mistakes. 
---
It's not a "bug" if the programer choose to code that only the slayer get the rewards. Sure, it's not frequent in GW2 to get does mecanic (pretty much never actually) but it's still not a "bug". It's a bad way to code this rewards, I'm totally with you on this one.

Is this the computer? If so, these things were not made with gaming/heavy graphics loads in mind, all they have is the i3 integrated graphics. 
---
If you're into gaming and want a great upgrade, head over to /r/buildapc  or /r/buildapcforme with a good summary of what you use the system for (work, personal, gaming [what types of games, hours of gaming per week, etc] ,and most importantly BUDGET) and I'm sure you'll find something that you can plan for or buy with the money you spend on beer each month (example, I'm sure you're a find upstanding citizen) that will exceed your expectations. Seriously, these guys built a $400 desktop that slayed their ps4 and xbox brothers a few years ago. 
---
Either way, if you only game occasionally and the AIO x5801 unit fits the majority of your needs, then the graphics tweaks in the other comments should be sufficient. If you want to do graphics heavy stuff in the future, though, give /r/buildapc a view and see what might fit your needs. 
---
Good luck, and I hope you enjoy Tyria! 
---
I was jealous. Aurene has never snuggled up to me as the commander like that. 
---
Also, I don't like Caithe and I never will. Not after the way she murdered Wynne just because she refused to stand up to her maniac girlfriend.
---
Also not acceptable:
---
[spoilers] I AM LITERALLY CRYING!
---
Anyone who played E4 knows really only two reasons why you could be crying.
---
thanks, i'll do that :)
---
I saw that too, and given information from previous episodes there was really only 2 reasons why they would be literally crying.
---
They didnt have to make a thread title basically telling us one of the two most likely characters to die, dies.
---
Only in Dragon Stand, and that whole map is a freak show.
---
Take screenshots and send a support ticket.
---
In raids and fractals I'm allways efficient, pushing to the limit. But not in open world.
---
Here I'm just running the build with more surviveability and which is fun to play.
---
Open world is the only place to me where nothing else matters. :)
---
they are amazing
---
The skipping and it being hard to skip is part of the fun üò° don't touch my arah!
---
It was pretty easy and fun, at least something new.
---
I'm not sure if we will next episode, but the next season will theoretically move us towards the next x-pac's story (i.e. Like season 3), so they need to wrap him up quick and start migrating us to the next chapter. Kralkatorrik will die either the next episode or in one of the first episodes of season 5. The fallout of which will push us towards the next part of the narrative and next x-pac.
---
To be fair, they do provide a value? It‚Äôs something I can give them money for and get something back without having the desire for said something. 
---
I won‚Äôt buy an outfit I don‚Äôt want or a glider I don‚Äôt want so I might spend $20 on keys and open like 25 chests instead. A way to support the game if there isn‚Äôt something I want at the time but still feel like supporting them. 
---
However, I struggle between liking the adoption licenses and hating them. It‚Äôs a super cool idea of being able to get random themed mount skins, most of which are modelled after real animals so it‚Äôs cool. But it also sucks when you care about which one you want because you don‚Äôt want to fucking gamble for it. So, glad they‚Äôve started offering choices as well. 
---
Someone already posted this.
---
I do hope we get to see Kas and Zafirah meet to compare and contrast their views on the Six. Kas's backstory as a noble who fell on hard times before rising again while coming to terms with Balthazar's betrayal and the departure of the gods, and Zafirah once having been one of Zalambur's Hamaseen lieutenants before abandoning the organization for the Church of Balthazar and realizing that Balthazar lives on in a different way, could provide us with some interesting conversation potential. In fact, I'd love to see a reunion of Zalambur and Zafirah and see how it plays out. :)

If there are many futures, (and Aurene saw multiple,) then prophecy isn't very valuable at all.

Yes, that champion is both infuriating and adorable with its kicking attacks.

The great powers of these jackalopes makes me hope that [Hare](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hare_(spirit)), the often ridiculed Spirit of the Wild, is ultimately revealed to be a deceptively cute, pint-sized powerhouse who slaughters Icebrood left and right when the times comes for the Spirits to (hopefully) lend us a paw or two in the fight against Jormag. ;)

It really is as we get a lot of those reported but then we're like well it's not really breaking the rules but if you think about it you can sort of figure it out. A lot of the reaction posts were like that. 
---
I'm thinking that for the next episode we may just make one 'Reaction Megathread' and not allow individual posts discussing the ending at least for the first day or two. I think it's safe to say with how this episode ended, 6 is going to be even crazier. 
---
If GW2 were restricted to age 18+, I'd have no issues with loot boxes. But they make me very uneasy when kids play.
---
&gt; I'm a player getting back into GW2, and I honestly am not having the easiest time gearing up to a set of Ascended gear so I can reach that perception of having minimal standard for higher level structured content.
---
Ascended gear is not required for Raids or low level fractals.
---
Raid training here: https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/
---
Possibly up to date gearing guide: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character
---
I‚Äôm sorry, you say these are for raids... but fail to mention, raiders and drowning in stat selectable gear, even if they don‚Äôt have legendary armor already. And fractal rings have the stats too.... like, diviner is super easy to get for raiders.
---
Right behind you, brotha
---
Why is Exotic Gear harder to get than Ascended Gear? That's kinda unintuitive. 
---
Why does the crafting recipe exist in the first place if it's not a viable method of obtaining the gear?
---
I missed it! When will the next one be? And what's your IGN, can I friend you and join for the next one? I go by Wonderbouter; hope to see you in game!
---
Yes, "Bright Eyes" is such a memorable song in it, and the score is great too. The novel is quite wonderful and well worth a read, as is its sequel *Tales from Watership Down*. :)
---
Incidentally the rabbits and hares of Tyria have their own Spirit of the Wild, the sadly often ridiculed but sympathetic [Hare](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hare_\(spirit\)) who may one day be revealed as a cunning pint-sized powerhouse and end up kicking all kinds of Icebrood butt from Deldrimor Front to Far Shiverpeaks if given a chance. :)
---
I'm preparing to run my own Sylvari through this but I imagine she'll most likely just collapse under her own weight and stare blankly. Maybe someone will put a comforting hand on her shoulder and she'll break down. She raised Aurene, teaching her to help people and to do what is right for the world. She'll see this is more than just a massive failure on her part. She failed to protect Tyria's future, and blames herself for letting that hope die. The only other person that would even remotely understand her pain is Caithe.
---
\*Sighs heavily\* This was heavy enough. Now I gotta do it again. Awesome video though! Really drives it home with "Escapism" playing in the background (which I think, for a video game, there's a strong sense of irony, because we escape our own world to be in this one only to face tragic events here too)
---
All of the second half of PoF starting from Kesho onwards and all of Season 4.
---
I am actually confused on how you missed it unless you didn't do that story.
---
[SPOILER] Koss is awesome!
---
Haha.
---
Sorry should have been more specific. Right now my guild which is made of alot of my friends IRL, we are raiding in WoW and we enjoy it, but my friends don't really want to give Guild Wars 2 a shot because it doesn't have traditional rolls, also they tried it a long time ago and didn't really like it.   
---
I would like to raid with them as the way we raid is by going in blind and not looking up any guides, coming up with our own strats.

Ahhh rubi nooo.
---
All of the raiding is tied behind both expansions, Heart of thorns and Path of Fire. The only real endgame content you have access to would be the Fractal system, which is the guild wars precursor to the WoW Mythic + system. a range of dungeons with various levels, affixes and difficulties .
---
Low skill floor sky-high skill ceiling is what GW2 is all about. Inlcuding gearing your toon.
---
Yes, let's make GW2 like every single other fantasy world. Why not add orcs/orks too?
---
In case you couldn't tell, that was sarcasm. Both Sylvari and Humans have elven traits (the Sylvari basically being plant-shaped elves, or elf-shaped plants, and the humans filling the "once proud race that has since faded" paradigm), so there's narratively no place for traditional elves 
---
Try a relog.
---
Had a similar idea in mind, though not as a video. I hope I can still muster the will to do it now.  
---
Beautiful drawings.
---
if you don't buy the game (although now would probably be the best time to be honest, full game plus both expansions for $25 total), then your end game content will be fractals of the mists. Fractals are kind of like 5-man dungeons, each should take maybe 10 ish minutes from a random PUG, sometimes more, sometimes a little bit less, and you get rewards for doing 6 daily (should take about an hour total)
---
Fractals are split into 4 tiers, and each tier has 25 levels. At each level is a particular fractal, of which there are 20 now, so there are still a few repeats.
---
Each jump in tier makes the enemies hit harder, have more life, and introduces a new mechanic called an instability, which is a daily rotating system of weird modifications to each fractal. For example, Sugar Rush means that for that fractal, both you and enemies will have increased movement and attack speed. 
---
The first 2 tiers are pretty easy, and can be done without really paying too much attention to DPS. Tiers 3 and 4 are substantially more punishing from there.
---
What's the easiest ascended weapon to obtain?
---
Seems like they forgot to add infusions slots during the hype.
---
Where do I send a support ticket?
---
Calling Sylvari elves makes less sense than calling Asura dwarves. 
---
and thats kids, is how you cc
---
I am not familiar with raiding in WoW but going in without guides is totally possible.
---
Currently raid groups (composed of 10 man squads) are composed of these classes/roles:
---
Tank - chrono (mesmer), 
---
Healer - druids (ranger), heal scourge (necromancer)
---
Dps - basically all other classes 
---
its very helpful to know your roles/classes before you go into raids though. But if you enjoy the challenge and learning everything on the road you could do that blind as well :D
---
Loot boxes are just generally terrible no matter what age is involved.  It can create addictions and that's not good.  The only game I find them acceptable is Overwatch.  That's for a few reasons.  1. There is no in-game economy to trade items.  2.  You get the crates/boxes for free whenever you level up which you do by just playing the game.
---
They could do client side skins I guess. There's a lot of client side phasing done in recent times
---
It's still not on precursor armor ):
---
Better, eliminate rng and find Mesmer port in lfg and tip the person opening the ports.
---
I didn't even talk about a build really? This is just an introduction video to the series. The builds will start next week.
---
Except that Glint hated Kralkatorrik with every fiber of her being in GW1. It's because of him that she was corrupted.
---
&gt;What made France special for Dofus?
---
Hilarious question without context.
---
&gt; My hope is that we go on a big quest to resurrect aurene, but it comes at a price.

A meta map that has us balancing kralks energy levels.  Encasing him in crystal then him breaking out every so often. Could even have some time loops with his dragon magic

Sylvari used to be a [lot](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Sylvari_15_concept_art.png) [more](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Caithe_02_concept_art.jpg) [elf-like](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Sylvari_03_concept_art.jpg) in the concept art, so it's not really all that radical to compare the two.
---
But no, elves as a race have never existed in Tyria. If they were to implement a playable race, it would more than likely be an already established race within the lore, rather than creating a new one altogether just for the race of making a new race.
---
Tengu, Largos, Kodan are all established races that personally I'd rather see than elves, who would really just be shoehorned into the game
---
Okay but how would you explain the fact of Glint bothering to tell Aurene about Ascension then?
---
Btw good post, solid case for the most part for yourself and one of the few I've seen that seems to be ''accepted'' and not secondguessed very much by the community! 
---
asura are obviously gnomes ...
---
Alright, just had to vent how this is being **exploited against players:**
---
So I'm (stupidly) riding the wave of players coming in after one of the metas. People are already getting frustrated at the drop rate.
---
One mesmer has a plate on his back but sticks around. Maybe to help, whatever. He later remarks that he has had MULTIPLE MORE plates drop from various kills. People begin to yell at him to leave so others can get drops. He seems to at first, but returns after about a minute.
---
He announces he's gonna just port people to the end. He lingers in the room until enough people decide to follow him.
---
I stay. I figure once the crowd is gone, I can get my drop and go through the rooms (because I find them fun, tbh).
---
But the mesmer comes back and just hangs out in the back of the room, even remarking that he's getting more drops from our kills despite not even participating.
---
He eventually convinces the other stragglers to let him port them. I stay out of pride. By the time I get it, my Light of Deldrimor is expired.
---
No worries though, I have another two plate fragments.
---
Only I can't turn them in until the next day. So all of that was completely wasted.
---
__________
---
So it seems that the drop table fixated on one player as long as he was in the room, allowing him to deny others with his presence alone. He used this to leverage people to use his porting service, probably racking up some tips along the way.
---
When I explained the situation to him, he played dumb and remained in the room.
---
I was the first one in and the last one out. It took me 37 minutes to get the drop.
---
If I had a nickel for every time one of my undead minions tried to turn on me...
---
&gt;I'm all for changes like this, content is too easy nowadays.
---
Slippery Slope does not add any difficulty whatsoever. It's just annoying. The increased Stability duration doesn't directly counter the instability either, which makes zero sense given the design of the other instabilities.
---
&gt;You had to carefully think about your rotations or leap off and slide away.
---
Not remotely accurate. The counter to SS is literally just to stand still and shit out Stab so that you aren't getting CCed (for example, getting knocked back and therefore gaining momentum and sliding). There's nothing challenging or fun about that. You gain next to no momentum whatsoever on mobility skills so it is actually easier to use skills like Surge of the Mists or Whirlwind Attack than without the instability, and in the event that you slide more than you like you can dodge and get rid of all of your momentum instantly.
---
SS is awful. It's a wonky, untested mess that does nothing to change the playstyle of good players while managing to be more obnoxious than old SA.
---
I'm talking about the one in the comment I replied to, not the one in the overall post.
---
And Charr fill the orc archetype. You can run from the fantasy tropes, but you can't escape them.
---
Sandshifter would be a fun elite spec, be it for elementalist or ranger...
---
The Branded Wing Glider can now be dyed. Doing bears no result.
---
Literally 99% of every single pug run I do, and I pug Arah every single day, majority of the time there is no run where everything is perfectly skipped. People are aggroing shit constantly and there is a lot of RNG involved with patrols where they aggro even if you do everything perfectly because they walk close to you.
---
But sometimes you can aggro shit by accidentally hitting something with a blast when you're trying to stealth and reveal yourself. Sometimes you might fuck up and use a leap skill but not cancel the end animation with a weapon swap and get revealed. Sometimes you might be trying to target something to use a teleport skill but then accidentally autoattack afterwards from having it targetted still, sometimes you might stealth too late. Sometimes shit just happens. Even the best and most knowledgeable players will die sometimes... but they won't die if you remove any potential threats.
---
Seriously I don't know why your comment has 5 upvotes but it's alarming that anybody would agree with the idea of nerfing the difficulty of dungeons in 2019, wtf?
---
The commander is an empty character that the player can try to picture himself in. Calling him/her a Mary sue is just ignorant.
---
Not to mention the commander has faced defeat or bittersweet victories as soon as the first personal story quest. And later No matter your choice in race you will always lose your mentor on claw island.
---
As I told you in my youtube comments, I'm not a professional youtuber and I'm not soliciting criticism. 
---
Secondly, I am well aware of how to script a video, I've got hundreds of videos on my channel and many are indeed scripted. The fact you believe you have to explain this to me says a lot about your perception of yourself and the value of your thoughts. Having good self-esteem is nice I guess, but you'll go a lot farther in life by keeping most of your thoughts to yourself unless invited to share them. This is solid advice if you follow when you get out of high school and move into the workforce will see you get rapid promotions at whatever fast food establishment you gain employment at. =)
---
I'd rather see Largos than yet another furry "race". Anthropomorphic animals are such a cheap cop-out.
---
you are not, I believe, allowed to have 2 accounts in WvW at once because of active player limitations (filling up server with multi-boxed accounts) allowing to denial of service of players on the server (even to a small extent).
---
&gt; E.g, using that previous example, if someone WANTS to play a Longbow Soulbeast, what might their best option be?
---
I cant create infinite build videos about every trash weapon and class combination, but rest assured that a power soulbeast build will be shown. It's a class with very strong dps potential and support capabilities.
---
A lot of older players have a loooot of mystic forge stones, so the silver kit just isn't worth it for them. Even if they burn through 2 or so a week they'll be flush with kits for a long time. But if you don't have that many, then sure, silver fed is just fine. Rares are very, very, very plentiful, so we see lots of them. 
---
Personally, I bought the silver fed when it came out and used it about 3 times, because it seemed pointless to use when I had a stupid amount of stones. So I'm trying to use my stones up because making kits with them is the only worth while use of 'em. 
---
My favorite is how we both get downvoted

He has a valid point. The community doesn't benefit from nerfing old content, it just makes the game less interesting. Nothing about that would be good for the community. As I said in another comment, significant powercreep has already made Arah much much easier. 
---
Perhaps anet could add an easy mode as an alternative to explorable mode, but nerfing existing dungeons would do more harm than good. 
---
hmm orc aren't usually known for their engineering skills
---
Hey guys, I'm relatively new to FoTM and am looking to do Raids in the future.  
---
I have a Condi Bannerslave Berserker (3 ascended trinkets, all being berserker since I used to play on Core Warrior), and since I got kinda bored of it, I was looking for a main to get 150 AR and get into Raids.  
---
What do you guys recommend?  
---
So far I liked Chrono, Ele, DH and Rev.
---
Possibly because a lot of people, like me, stopped running it 5 years ago because it was too hard, and there wasn't any point.  I still kind of don't want to do twilight arbor because of how hard it was at launch, and that's as simple as hell these days. The giant wurm at the start still makes me nervous, and that never fails these days. 
---
Probably your elite specialisation collection.
---
Fair point, GW1 charr are much closer to generic fantasy orcs.
---
So, you're claiming that any given guardian can solo any elite mob in arah? 
---
The Largos are sorta like dark elves. I hope we never see real elves tho, they're the most generic fantasy race.
---
Unless they transferred their mind similar to mordy to trahearne
---
If we're allowed to assume they have a brain, then yes.
---
i dont mind challenging content for real.
---
give more fractals cms or tune them higher but god pls make it **constant**.
---
rng is tilting and some of those instabs are not fun at all.
---
i would rather have an instabs that increases enemy hp by 25% instab of this slippery garbage.
---
since i do fractals on a daily basis and 42 farm sometimes its a profit mode for me. what is the point of challenging content if it doesnt get rewarded?
---
why should i put more time in fractals due to instabs if i get the same rewards? for the challenge? it isnt a challenge since i will finish it anyway daily.
---
it simply drains more time than necessary
---
Feel free to check out the [new player guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers) here
---
The mounts themselves come from Path of Fire, and you unlock them just through playing the game, but to experience the full game, you will want to buy both Path of Fire and Heart of Thorns. Both expansions have features that can't be accessed if you only have the other one (elite specs, specific raids, specific masteries, specific maps, etc.)
---
The standard edition is perfectly fine, you get some quality of life stuff from the deluxe edition but it's not really necessary.
---
Path of fire will give you access to the 5 first mounts introduced in September of 2017. The beetle mount is available in the living world season 4 episode 3. Heart of thorns is recommended for the story and access to gliding which is a nice save from falls, but if you just want mounts path of fire is a good start
---
Thank you, I have a gt530
---
Thank you!!!
---
It costs too much to be worth it. Silver kit costs 20 times more per use than the Copper-fed, but it isn't 20 times more effective. Someone's done the math somewhere (try the wiki) but that's the gist of it.
---
You admit that you haven't even tried them for 5 years yet you want them to nerf it when people who regularly do them are claiming that it isn't a good thing to make them even easier to do than they already are.
---
Yeah you have made it very obvious at this point you don't have what's best for the community in mind.
---
And I don't disagree with the notion that conquest is a node-centred game mode and that the nodes and their status (who owns them, who is currently located on/around them) dictate the status of a map and the direction of a game. Obviously.
---
The reason I take issue with the specific "fight on the node" sentiment ist that it is echoed so strongly and blindly that it is to the detriment of many players learning the game. People will happily die on a node feeling that they did something worthwhile by  holding it for a few more seconds. In other cases they will pull someone harassing them on the roads to a node a foe is located on, getting themselfs outnumbered, rather than try and deal with the harasser first, getting combat break and then attacking the sidenoder (obviously the sidenoder should see this and plus them on the roads anyway in most scenarios, but this still gives more opportunities to the original player).
---
When playing unranked I see rather bad players calling out people doing something sensible all the time, because they are not "fighting on point" all the time - this discourages players that are actually on the right track.
---
How so? I'd love to see a Largos expansion, but the Tengu are cool as fuck. Kodan would be kinda boring tho imo, I don't think there's much you can do with them.
---
Ok so the bit about no traditional rolls is kind of, not so wrong but kind of "dated" subjective wording wise due to elite specs.  Most early game content/open world/personal story/dungeons  don't need your classic  "I am tank i provoke the mobs". Anet  wanted to make it so people can play the game regardless of the class.  
---
Currently every class in the game has a viable support (viable reading as "you can spec into a build without it being counter productive see following example, with the exception of warrior(no healing weapon skills for allies) and thief (but it has venoms so, support..ISH) choice.  Some classes are just their to output  unique boons better like how chrono brings low self dps but  facetanks and provides amazing boonshare and quickness/alacrity. Meanwhile firebrand brings  constant aegis to block damage period, tempest has great sustain, druid etc etc.
---
We don't have a divine" paladin tank, disc priest etc" but currently we have 4(5if we count tempest)  valid often brought healer types being druid, firebrand and im not sure the current verdict as of this patch if herald or renegade is the better choice, and  we can not deny that  "healing" scourge while it provides  low actual healing has massive rez and damage denial via the barrier mechanic for extreme carry potential.
---
The main reason  people  bring chrono is it can go bulky at the same time it gets its boon duration/ it has the ability to just not give a damn about boss attacks due to the amazing sword 2 blur, distortion and the shield blocks.
---
TLDR:  For anything lower than a tier 3 fractal or raids  you can do whatever with zero issue, we do slightly have roles for harder content. a handful of raid bosses do use a traditional tank= toughness stat. some have special fixate or "is this person far away, im going to chase them down"
---
Hope that helps i can go into less rambly detail if you want and feel free to add me : )
---
I was just being cheeky.   :-)    I don't like the idea for other reasons pointed out here, that it just seems wrong to me.  I don't think anyone deserves a downvote for their opinions though especially something silly like this.  Have an upvote!
---
There's a difference between not needing it and it being optimal. A Diviner/Assassin mix is optimal for any Chrono.
---
On the other hand, if you raided before, Assaulter (and apparently Healer, too) drops from raids contain Diviner stats, and so does Legendary gear.
---
&gt; ArenaNet also declined to discuss how many Game Directors it has.
---
Interesting... I've been with this game for 4 years now and have seen 3 Game Directors in action (Colin Johanson, Mike O'Brien and Mike Zadorojny)
---
However I have never heard this name... that's pretty quiet for someone *this* improtant. She didn't even get mentioned by people who worked under her... and now we hear of her departure a good 2 months after the fact... very wierd.
---
The community of 5 dungeon runners who cling to old content because it makes them feel special? *pats you on the head* run along and run your dungeons, dear.  We're done here. 
---
This question has been asked a lot so I guess a quick google search would provide much better answers.
---
The easiest IMO was caladbolg collection, this is however only possible if you have completed HoT storyline. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caladbolg_weapons
---
Apart from them elite specialization collections would be cheap. 
---
However the only sure way to get them is crafting.  
---
Was posted quite often already. While it is annoying the instance isn't as long as it seems the first time through and the achievements are not that challenging compared to other story achievements we had this season.
---
How much is cheap
---
I‚Äôve played weaver in fotm for the past few months and I‚Äôve never had the bug
---
Elite elementalists and hunters you can literally AFK with a wall of reflection up and watch the elites kill themselves. Then there are illusionists which really can hurt and will require you to dodge and interrupt and/or rely on killing it before it can use chaos storm. Elite mages can have their autoattacks reflected but it uses a knockback in melee range and occasionally will summon pulsing wells which apply regen to nearby risen and damage you if you stand in them. Elite abominations are extremely unthreatening except for their charge attacks which will 1-shot a person in berserker's gear.
---
There's a lot of things you can learn about them if you bothered to set foot in the dungeon and practiced it before claiming something with which you've hardly ever done before needs to be nerfed.
---
I've never personally had it....but my group members see it religiously but only when a Weaver is in the group 
---
Speaking from a fractal perspective and not raids
---
Chrono is always welcome, but it also takes a bit more effort to gear up and get confident in your rotation. Also, they change chrono around so often in an attempt to balance everything out that we'll have to see how the future holds for that.
---
Ele is also a strong DPS choice pretty much everywhere, but it's also extremely punishing if you mess up in PUGs because you're so squishy and your party might not accommodate for that perfectly
---
DH is a solid but not amazing power DPS choice with decent sustain. No real complaints there. A bad DH has the same problem as a bad Ele, just not quite as much, since life pools for DH and Ele are tied, but armor is not. 
---
Rev in fractals is interesting. It hasn't really been a top pick for a while to bring a revenant in any degree, because herald dps isn't the best, and it brings boons that can be supplied otherwise, and condi renegade has some issues with ramp up damage. Support renegade has been making some interest recently though, because of its pretty easy alacrity sharing ability, so FB/ren is a decent quickness/alacrity combination.
---
I don't really want to see Aurene mounts everywhere, that doesn't make any sense. Can we preserve at least a tiny amount of immersion?
---
now i'm thinking if there was any time i encountered the bug without any weavers, my memory fails me
---
I'd like to see more Kodan-Norn interaction, see how the lore really ties those two races together, but I wasn't really throwing them out there as a playable race, just an example of established races that they can work with rather than Elves.
---
"I want content that I don't ever do and haven't touched in 5 years to be nerfed when I know nothing about them to have a relevant opinion of" -MechaSandstar

If stupidity were to be contagious then the only reason I'd be feeling "special" right about now is from reading your comments.

Uncategorized Fractal
---
It's so uncreative. "Hey let's anthropomorph &lt;insert animal here&gt; and call it &lt;race name&gt;!" They're all over the place. Everywhere.
---
Tengu do have a somewhat fresh twist on the whole animal race thing as birds rarely get anthropomorphized. Same with quaggans, for example. But I'd rather see something actually fresh.
---
Yes thank you. 
---
I had this happen to me today: He didn't drop a plate on a full instance, so I swapped into an empty one (where people were doing south meta, so the tomb was pretty empty) and then got purple runes drop 10/10 times...o__O
---
So while this is annoying and obviously a bug I agree with OP: Other than that its fine. You get 3 guaranteed, have at least 8 dwarven chests with a change to drop another oen in the tomb itself, additional chances in the south wing (not sure how many yet) and a chance from the meta. Even with bad luck an average of 6/day seems achievable. This is 1 exo+asc weapon/day or 2 exos a day, leading to 8-16 days of farming if you go for the skins and a bit more if you go for the armorstats...whats the big deal?
---
This cheap gold wise: https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/ascended
---
He didn't really win at the end of LW3 either. We kill his dogs and stop him from stealing all of the energy from two elder dragons.
---
The hivemind is probably going to gangrape me, but I'd rather see Elves with a twist than another "race" that's just anthropomorphic animals.
---
Imagine being this much of a condescending asshat *unironically.*
---
And before you try to come at me, no I don't run dungeons.
---
How did you verify your identity? I don't have my HoT serial number, but I found a purchase for gems I did on the account and sent them the order number.
---
Nothing is stronger then magical plot armor
---
The fix didn't work for me. I had to wait for reset.
---
Most what you linked isn't relevant. Games the scale well with number of cores/threads, multithreaded benchmarks etc. Of course will a stock 9900k have better single core performance than a stock 8700k, boost is 300 MHz higher. And a stock 9900k being marginally better than a stock 8086k is what was I said too. I pointed out that a 8086k/8700k with 100 MHz higher clocks has better single core performance than a 9900k. Oh and guess what, one of your links [confirms that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmAWqyHdebI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=770).
---
And yes, single core performance is the only thing that matters for GW2. It is happy with a 4 core/8 thread CPU, any more cores won't make a difference. And an delidded average 8086k will clock higher than an average 9900k.
---
Are there groups/guild/schedules that are still running Serpent's Ire meta? I'd want to complete my Inquest backpack and I'm held by the collection that requires that meta be completed.
---
&gt; You need to move on. You've had "your" arah for 6 years. Time to make it accessible.
---
How in the actual fuck is it not accessible? How are *any* of the dungeons not accessible? We've got fractals and raids that are vastly harder than the dungeons, and nobody complains that those aren't accessible. You can skip virtually everything in them if the subreddit is to be believed, and the same subreddit says that even if you *don't* skip, the enemies are pointlessly simple to kill anyway.
---
Fix the bugs that have developed over the years, make the dungeons (and their drops) work correctly as intended, and be done with it. Maybe if dungeons lost their reputation for being such broken buggy crapshoots, more people would be interested.
---
Okay but did you try grieving base ele?
---
What? No one ever called Asura dwarves. We're (realistically) gnomes, gremlins, &gt;!or more accurately, your rightful rulers and masters, bookah!&lt;.  
---
I feel you. I actually made a post the day before the patch hit. I commented how I couldn‚Äôt believe people were already posting all kinds of potential spoilers. I said I would log off Reddit until Sunday. I actually did the entire story today, start to finish, so now I‚Äôm back on Reddit (this is my first post since Monday evening).
---
It‚Äôs funny/strange/awful because the post was evenly upvoted and downvoted, but the mods deleted it because they called it low effort (just because a post seems low effort doesn‚Äôt mean that it should be deleted ‚Äì there was an intent to warn people in it).
---
And yet here I see all of these posts three days afterwards calling out the fact people are spoiling the story. I tried to warn people, and it just didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll count this as a win and let this be a lesson to myself to make sure I don‚Äôt log on the Monday before a release until I finished the story. It worked this time because I definitely would‚Äôve seen all the things that you guys did.
---
I can confirm that every time that I have encounter this bug I had Elementalist in my party. Maybe it don't affect the Ele itself? 
---
The only elves I know of in Tyria are either pre-release Sylvari design and Wintersday elves from GW1 (a tonic - the only remain of that in GW2 is Lord Faren's Wintersday special miniature)
---
The kourna case is the default gw2 loot behavior: You have to do enough dmg to tag the boss and you will get loot. The problem is that the boss that gives you loot has very little health (the golem form is technically another foe that doesn't drop anything but transitions into the relevant boss, thats why you dont "inherit" your tag from the golem phase). So here the problem doesnt have anything to do with implimentation, but with game design: the asuras health should scale more with the mobsize for the last phase so everyone can tag it easily.
---
The problem with the gravling is another one altogether that likely has to do with implementation since the drop behavior is different from what gw2 usually does. The reason for this is most likely that this is not actually an item drop, but a phased spawn event triggered by the deathstrike.
---
You get more stones randomly in the [daily login rewards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Black_Lion_Goods) too and seeing as it only takes 3 stones to make a 250 use kit some people have a lot to work with. Assuming you give no value to the mystic forge stones then the Mystic Salvage Kit is only 10.5 Copper coin per salvage, compared to the Silver-Fed Salvage-o-Matic's 60 Copper coin per salvage. After just one kit you could have saved ~1.2g on salvage costs. Also, I don't go through mystic kits all that fast so I don't really get any saved space or convenience from the silver-fed like I do with copper-fed
---
Uhhhhh chrono is most definitely going to run Diviner‚Äôs in raids. There is 0 reason why it shouldn‚Äôt so I have no idea where you got that from. 
---
Benchmarks have already been released for chrono using the gear if that‚Äôs not enough to point towards its use in raids 
---
As for Fb/ren in fractal, i see more and more groups using a firebrand due to its ability to provide ridiculous stability aswell as the ‚Äúchaos‚Äù boon we no longer have through chronos. It is extreme quality of life at very little cost of dps.
---
Also a viable option is  dps/alac chrono alongside it to provide portals and alac aswell as outputting roughly bs level damage (likely higher now with diviner‚Äôs I haven‚Äôt tested in fractals) while most definitely using diviner‚Äôs gear.
---
[removed]
---
raids in gw2 are way more dynamic and honestly more fun. 
---
The downstate-mechanic also makes the progress less cancer in my opinion (when only one person fails a mech, you can easily get him up again and continue) 
---
Also, I'm not sure if you really care about something like that, the raid-instances are always so god damn beautiful and filled with tons of details to explore, I really enjoy that (just watch a video from the "Mythwright Gambit" and you see what I mean) - the music is also pretty nice btw 
---
There is a meta which forces you a bit to certain classes for certain roles (Roles are mostly: Healer, Dps, Tank (+boonshare), and kiter for some final bosses) 
---
Another point I really enjoy in gw2 is that the old raids don't decrease in difficulty when a new one comes in. Because of the mastery system the bosses will always be as though as on the release day and you still need to improve by progress 
---
Sorry, when did they change how the Dungeon worked? Oh, that's right, power creep.  Got it. 
---
New SA is tons better than old SA. Stacking agony just for being too close to a player was *way* more punishing than pushing players back a little bit if you run into them. It's a bit inconvenient, sure, but in the end all instabilities are just minor annoyances. I think instabilities should either be made for specific fractals (in order to add meaningful mechanics to the fractals instead of just being annoying) or they just shouldn't exist at all.
---
&gt;Take for example with revenant making more of an appearance, it has a very strong CC on staff 5, but if you use it on the boss you're likely to push your entire party out of position.
---
This has some merit but a good Renegade should know how to position themselves to minimize the intrusion.
---
Slippery Slope is the instability that I think needs to be talked about. It's extremely annoying while also failing to change how you play. The physics are awful and it genuinely seems like Anet didn't test it whatsoever. Momentum is extremely inconsistent and skills like Surge of the Mists are actually *easier* to use with SS because you move less and get more hits in, and dodging completely halts your momentum. It's like they threw in the technology to make all the floors turn to ice without actually testing its playability and how it interacts with the fractals. It feels lazy.
---
SS encourages players to stand completely still and use Stability/Aegis to nullify incoming hard CC which is terrible design because you ideally want to stand still and Stab/Aegis through any mechanics you may come across anyway, making this instability seem completely irrelevant in combat. High-level groups phase so fast that they will literally never have to deal with mechanics so they aren't really impacted by SS either other than the fact that movement, especially uphill and downhill, is obnoxious.
---
Its a EU/NA thing. I havn't really done DS on a release day ever (because: new content), but periodically come back to DS for currencies at odd hours and never had problems either.
---
Yupp, I do fractals daily too with the additional fourth "instability" of spiky high latency heh. That's how much I like the content. 
---
Fractals used to be awesome, I remember a time when fractal team was widely regarded as the best team in Anet.  But everything seems to be going downhill within the past year, starting with the random instabilities. 
---
I miss the quick clears from non random instability era. I miss when fractals wasn‚Äôt all about pDPS, when pugs made up from lots of non meta classes. Hell, just as I‚Äôm getting comfortable with pugging CMs they slap us with this bullshit. It seems like they‚Äôre hell bent in destroying the game mode. 
---
The reason I got into fractals was to have fun, git gud in the process and be rewarded for the efforts. As one get better, the runs become smoother and easier. I‚Äôll say again and again that Nightmare fractal is my favourite (both non CM and CM), hell I‚Äôve even taken a liking to 100CM. These are quite challenging but fun. 
---
Slippery Slope though? Not fun. And I say that from the perspective of someone with SAB W2 infusion. It‚Äôs tolerable in SAB because it wasn‚Äôt a group thing, but something that can be done in our own time. Again, I will say, if Slippery Slope is so good, then make it live in Raids as well. You know, because it‚Äôs *the other* end game PvE content. That‚Äôs only fair. 
---
&gt;oesn't give an achievement but it's a fun little thing. Not sure if anyone found out yet but north of \[Maiden's Veil\] poi on top of the mountain there's a green rabbit (skittish rabbit) and you can chase him down the mountain. At some point he turns into a champion Jackalope. He chain stuns so spread out (don't go alone) and just gives a champion bag + some random loot.
---
The original rabbit disappears and turns out to be an illusion cast by a monster with mesmer-like abilities called    [Nulfastu](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Nulfastu,_Earthbound).
---
The design on the new map is specifically designed to not allow hardcore players to get the new stats immediately, while being attainable in a fair amount of time. Tying stat sets to maps is also something they have done since back with Dry Top and nomades and it still works for that map even thought nomades isn't really in high demand in any gametype.
---
Ssoooo Kralk is in fact a Vex Mind...... Someone call Osiris.
---
You're too far into denial to accept being wrong. You found one result in your favor out of everything else that shows you are wrong. Please do tell me how an 8086k will be able to oc higher than the 9900k, what is it in the physical architecture of the cpu that will allow it to do so?
---
"Of course will a stock 9900k have better single core performance than a stock 8700k, boost is 300 MHz higher. And a stock 9900k being marginally better than a stock 8086k is what was I said too." Choosing to turn a blind eye to every benchmark that shows the 9900k leaving the 8700k/8086k 5ghz/5.2ghz in the dust is not helping you.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/797x8a/53_ghz_delid_is_this_a_good_score/   5.3ghz 8700k and is still 300-400 points behind a stock 9900k.
---
"And a stock 9900k being marginally better than a stock 8086k is what was I said too", "Overclocked 8086k is better for GW2 than overclocked 9900k. Fite me." Do you see how what you said makes no sense according to what you have admitted?
---
I could make a benchmark that uses full Giver's and say that full Giver's is the best build for MT Chrono and that would be just as meaningless as a benchmark for Diviner's Chrono.
---
You can absolutely use Diviner's just as much as you could use Harrier's or Giver's. Diviner's is good for players who need the extra BD, but Zerk/Assassin is still going to be the optimal choice.
---
I'm not saying you can't use Diviner's in raids, I'm just saying that it isn't needed unless you need the extra BD (aka: you're bad).
---
You missed the good stuff. Scarlet Briar was the best thing to happen to the game and it's gone down hill slowly since. 
---
Doomguy is the Commander we need, not the jabroni we have now.
---
What may be running like butter to you may not be to others.
---
Getting both expansions as a bundle will be a good use of your cash. But if you're only interested in mounts you'll need PoF and, I think, all of Season 4 unlocked so you can actually access the maps that lead to *Long Live The Lich* in the first place.
---
Especially since they know he's also going to lose Taimi at some point in the not-too-distant future, too. He always seemed closest to Taimi and Rox.
---
Kralky has no chill and decided to force the issue by starting to destroying the fabric of Tryia himself via the Mists. 
---
Buuuut! It's possible that our attack, his huge "By our powers combined!" beam, and Aurene's branding all de-powered  him enough that he can't access the Mists anymore. In which case we're back to having the Commander being the only person on Tyria destroying reality through their actions.
---
Which I'm kind of hoping because the Commander hunting down a badly injured elder dragon and wanting to kill it solely out of revenge would be a nice counter point to Braham going off on his own rampage after Eir died. And it would prove what we all know in our hearts to be true:&gt;! Joko was right.!&lt;
---
you put it pretty politely when the whole video is "uhhh..might is important and fury too..uhhhh..quickness too..uhmmm..alacrity not so much but still important"
---
it's ok man..you'll learn to give better criticism when you end up being a sports-obsessed, washed-up public defender
---
Except that you should absolutely not do this if it's your first time leveling a character to 80. Central Tyria was not built with mounts in mind and it should be explored on foot, as it was meant to be, for the best experiance IMO. 
---
The more people will be there to help you .. the less chance for you to get it. Even people with who already have the key still have the same chance to get it droped again as you do. The best way to get it is to be there alone. Sadly with the story focing people to go there its almost impossible to get the key from that veteran. I know your pain. Took me over half hour to get my key . Everytime I thought, I was finaly alone, someone showed up again. They didnt even attacked the veteran and yet the key frop for them and not for me. The purple room is one of the worst ones in the "minidungeon". 
---
While true still,tank chronos and some off will def swap some pieces for toughness gear for tanking and tanking control (example, tank get dcd or go down due to crap healer so off will take over)
---
What upsets me about this episode was how Anet made us bond with Aurene with all the trials dating back from LS3 and then went George R. R. Martin on her. 
---
Way too many characters are getting killed off in GW2 and now I feel like what‚Äôs the point in immersing myself to the story when a seemingly major character can suddenly drop like a fly? It breeds and apathy and IMO not a good writing direction.  I‚Äôm saying that from the perspective of a life long bookworm, i.e. generally it‚Äôs hard to make me not care about a story. 
---
Standard collection is a good value and will give you access to all of the mounts that enhance mobility.  HOT gives you gliding which is also nice.  
---
I'd only do the minimum required to get the mounts and then go back to your main character that you're enjoying with the mounts unlocked, since they're account wide.
---
trade-ins are unlikely since pretty much everybody that plays this game for a while has a stockpile of limited use convenience stuff like these
---
removing them from the loot table if you have the permanent version would be fair and far less impactful
---
Plz make them Senpai :)
---
Are you talking about the example given here? Because it's ambient dialogue and doesn't even explicitly mention that they are/were a same-sex couple, it's just a male name. Also, you'd only recognize that the name "Oleg" is male if you were familiar enough with eastern Slavic names. If it's the other one, it's just part of a conversation between two characters about their lives in ambient dialogue.

What is your point here exactly? Is it because these characters are not important, so that makes them tokens because they decided to make them gay? That's not really how tokenism works. A token is when a character that should be given more development and fleshed out isn't because the writer just reduces them to their sexuality/race/etc. In this case, NPC's that are really just there to populate the world and provide some ambient dialogue are never intended to do more than that. There's plenty of ambient dialogue in places like DR and everywhere else really where characters reference their opposite sex partner in all sorts of ways. Why can't we do the same with a same sex partner without people crying that it's a shoe-in for woke points?

I think I'd make a really good uncle.

I don't think I can handle a child at this point in my life. It's enough if I can handle my own finances right now lol.

Yikes. Easiest way to get someone against your content is to start off with "I'm not soliciting criticism." He put it nicely. This video is a waste of time aside from maybe 1/10th of it. 
---
I made a deliberate point of leveling my first character to 80 on foot, and I can say that you don't actually miss out on anything you'll care about by going around Tyria on raptor. In fact, you'll save time getting from one interesting thing to the next, meaning you can see even more interesting things.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Seriously, people should be free to level with raptors if they want without others judging them for it.

You haven't been paying much attention, eh?

Kralkatorrik, I've come to bargain!
---
So can anyone give me a help with Ele's PvP build? I've been trying Weaver but quite honestly I'm not sure how to play it and I'm pretty much dead weight. 
---
There is a small chance of getting a troll included in the group.
---
&gt;you can select it from LW3 trinkets which are super easy to get.
---
To be fair, we don't know if this is a bug yet, since it's been in the game already as a PvP amulet but the recipe involves LS4 materials.
---
he came in somewhen 2012 from nexon to give the gemshop a facelift.  
---
see what was in the shop over the years? give her the credit for that...especially those lootboxes, because thats basically what she came in for. "how to milk customers".  
---
sure you won't hear much from her over the years. would have been really weird if anet talked much about exactly that tbh. 
---
there won't be

Even if the sub did that wouldn't it only work if you were directly on the sub and not the homepage? Correct me if I am wrong.
---
Visions of the future in a setting where multiple possibilities of any future exists will never be fully accurate.
---
Even Glint's Flameseeker Prophecies were not fully accurate (and where they were, were so vague that you can apply the course of events to both Joko's rise and fall in Turai's time, as well as Zhaitan's rise and fall). Neither was Aurene's visions - **ANY** of the three we've been given access to.
---
Hell, the entire idea behind prophetic visions throughout fiction and myth is that they are either A) Self-fulfilling prophecies which occur because the persons involved make them come to pass by trying to prevent them, or B) One of many possibilities and it is prevented because it was foreseen.
---
And guess what? Aurene's vision of Mordremoth making clones of Trahearne? Prevented because it was foreseen. While the Flameseeker Prophecies was a self-fulfilling prophecies due to mechanizations by Glint to ensure everyone had the proper knowledge to go along the course she saw.
---
ArenaNet has established pretty clearly that the setting of Guild Wars follow the style of infinite possible futures. This was established point-blank in Infinity Ball (yet another case of prophecy unrelated to crystal dragons) as well as A Light in the Darkness. **ANY** vision of the future can come to pass or not, depending on the changes (or lack of) caused by witnessing the future. Which is why Aurene was able to see a dozen possible futures in A Star to Guide us, and is why Glint had to spend 800 years ensuring everyone got the right amount of information about her prophecies to do as she needed them to do for her vision to come to pass.
---
Besides all that, however, it should be noted that the Elder Dragons' magic has been confirmed to be the same types of magic as what flows in the ley lines. Meaning that the crystal dragons' magic of foresight exists in the very world's magic itself, and is accessible to all who knows how to access it.
---
&gt; She didn't foretell shit. All she predicted was that the Emperor would have him killed during the harvest ceremony. She didn't predict that he would enter the temple.
---
Can't kill someone at a ceremony said someone isn't attending. To kill Shiro, Shiro had to be invited into the temple, to the ceremony.
---
So by claiming the emperor would kill Shiro at the ceremony, by extension she was proclaiming Shiro would be invited to the ceremony, when such has never happened before.
---
&gt; I'm not prophetic for pointing a gun at your head and saying "you will die soon. beware the man with a gun", and then pulling the trigger.
---
No, but if someone says "You will be killed at the White House" while you have zero intention to go even into Washington D.C., then you get kidnapped and taken to the White House, but you pull out a gun and shoot everyone and run, that doesn't mean the person who proclaimed you'd be killed at the White House didn't foresee a future where you died there.
---
Probably keep it the same since the mastery is called PoF, it's tied to the expansion and since there isn't a new one yet that means that season 5 falls under PoF.
---
Glint's dialogue suggests to me that he had this "vision" of a peaceful world several millennia ago, before Glint was corrupted let alone before Glint was cleansed by the Forgotten. The Forgotten tried to cleanse Kralkatorrik within the past decade, after Glint's death.
---
All the people who cared about GvGs formed into groups that fought each other and nobody else for a while. Then they realised everyone else wanted to blob anyway so they left. 
---
The skill gap between a veteran GvG group and a random pug group is too big and there is no incentive to GvG, so everyone has given up. NA WvW is, even compared to a year ago (when there were GvG tournaments and all this excitement) really dead nowadays.
---
Also the meta has been broken and done to death, FB support and scourge bomb with a WoD (if they are even used after the nerfs) is both too punishing to play (for a newbie group) and too boring to GvG with (there's basically one set of actions a team needs to do, there's not enough room for creativity). 
---
This is talking about NA 10s-15s GvG which was melee-ball-y and usually done in enclosed spaces, which from what I understand is somewhat different to how EU plays. 
---
Where in the title does it say 'skill' or 'montage' or 'high level play'?
---
Or are people just mad that I made a tongue in cheek comment about Mesmers?
---
You need to have poison mastery to craft the weapon anyway so just focus on different aspects of the journey
---
Then dismount. 
---
There are many many areas that do not feel that way. The majority of shiverpeaks and ascalon benefit mightily from a raptor, as does most of Orr.
---
I can't really say anything other than: you're pulling this out of your ass. You're assuming their intent without providing any actual evidence of whether they did something to look woke. I've never seen them be performative about how they do representation at all.
---
I'm assuming this person is Price? You can just come out and say it. I see no connection between more gay people and work she did. The chances that she had impact on really minor character dialogue is low, she pretty much stated she was working on bigger pieces of the narrative, her job was not dialogue. ArenaNet has plenty of gay people working for them. Maybe, just maybe, they felt like representing themselves in a few characters here and there, and it had nothing to do with trying to look progressive or whatever other political thing.

&gt; What happened to making the maps completable for any level range of players??
---
lol that was never a thing. Would you expect a level 40 to be able to complete a level 80 map?
---
I honestly don't know where to start explaining to yu, but most returning players usually wanna at the very least update their gear, so why not start there?
---
If yur still in Exotics, then there is a tier higher called Ascended, which has more stats and armor.
---
It's advised to follow yur own pace when farming yur Ascended, rushing it could be expensive.
---
Next is probably to practice and understand yur favourite class, and the classes 2 Elite Specs. Each Elite spec needs 250 Hero Points to fully train so yu might wanna look for people advertising Hero Point Trains in HoT or PoF map instances and see if yu can get yurself some hero points.
---
Other than that it's up to yu to explore the expansions at yur own pace, and purchase Living World 2, 3 and 4 if yu crave more story and content. 
---
About the comment. I literally pull 40 Celsius playing gw2 with shadowplay and music going. You just need a good fan and airflow. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heroic_Dragonsblood_weapons
---
Nope, and neither does it say  "video of interrupting heal! very funny!", but it seems to imply you're getting "justice vs mesmers", which is what people think and in that department the video is rather poor and nothing to do with cheeky comment about mesmers because mesmers get enough hate already.
---
Turn depth blur off and curves off and toggle the rest :p
---
Really can't tell if you're extremely upset or trying to cosplay Jessica Price. Maybe you should lay off the internet for a while :))
---
Well if this is how Mesmers react to a joke, I would say the hates warranted.
---
You have to complete the forge part, which is part 2 if I‚Äôm correct, just done it, you need 8 laurels and other things to make your first one 
---
Mechanically there was no system keeping track of XP before HoT so there would of been no way to do that. Not to mention that would massively screw over new players as old players would just instantly have everything done.
---
It is not really hard at all to earn XP in the HoT maps. Do the Auric Basin or Dragon's Stand metas with an XP booster on, either ones you've gotten from login 2 hour ones, or buy 30 minute ones with laurels. Go to guild hall and get XP buff from there and there are a few other XP buffs you can do. Only a few runs and you'll be done with enough boosts.
---
There are some areas in the maps that I believe do require the masteries for completion because ANet expects you to earn all of the masteries except the raid ones.
---
As far as the collection goes, only Nevermore, Astralaria, Hope, and Chuka have these long collections. Rest of the gen 2 ones are just a crafting gold sink. The scavenger hunts look complicated at first but my advice is to go on the wiki and print them out to keep track of what you are doing or just bookmark the wiki and do it that way. I got Astralaria 1,2,3,4 done in only 3-4 weeks just using the wiki and looking up what to do.
---
Whereas your parents only made one. 
---
Its fun, but it really drags on for what it is. Short and intense would feel better than the current slog they can be.
---
He would probably never leave that map tho.
---
He seems so unmotivated to do anything after suffering so much. 
---
I have so many single use hair kits at this point that I practically have a permanent one.
---
Why not all?
---
But if you have to choose... Rev and Ele are by far the flashiest. Ele is one of those things that is super hard and will die if you have no idea what youre doing, but once you learn to play the piano on you keyboard and swap to the right stuff when needed it will become really good and impressive. Ele can also have that high damage and rev can beat em up real well, but I cant totally speak to gaurd and engi. From what I understand firebrand (gaurd elite spec) and holosmith (engi elite spec) are really good for damage. 
---
All around I personally would choose rev just because I think its the most fun, but what I said above is more objective to your criteria.
---
Oh no, I was offline eating. I'm actually on a TTS guild. Thanks though, I will watch it out tomorrow then.
---
Yup that post was stupid as fuck
---
You forgot to call him an asshat, didn't give him a weary stare and didn't use a single 9_9 emote. I rate this post 3 Jessica Prices out of 10. Apply yourself, you can do better in the future.
---
Upvoted for 20 year old deep cut.
---
I dont think its that bad to start over, if you have a free character slot, or a character youre willing to delete to make a new one. It might be helpful to jsut go through the leveling experience again and get accustomed to everything. Maybe try and find someone to play with that will actually help you and not say "sucks to suck", im free lol, and get quickly play through to level 80 again.
---
On the other hand, you could just keep asking for help in some of the more populated maps and re-lay through some of the stories until your comfortable.
---
You can't judge the metas on release. Well, you *can*, but it won't be representative of how they will look for the bulk of the game's lifespan.
---
See how easy they are in a few weeks. Come back later after the next season is out and see how easy they are. Ice floes in particular is concerning because you *need* to be in three places at once in order for it to succeed.
---
I honestly don't think there's much reason to come back to this map unless you're collecting weapons, doing achievements, or getting Diviner's gear. I'm concerned what will happen to Light of Deldrimor prices once the population dies down, and I *despise* that there's an enormous amount of downtime between the meta events with basically nothing to do on the map.
---
There's just nothing good about this situation.
---
I'd think this would go without saying, but you can't stop people I guess.
---
Trahearne wasn't impaled, he was imprisoned by tendrils and killed by us. We slayed him with his sword.
---
It was polite feedback.  No need to get defensive over it.

Any way to farm cured rugged leather square?

Sigh i'm done arguing with you, I already know that gw2 needs single core performance. I've already explained that 4.7ghz single core 9900k outperforms 5ghz 8700k and all you can come up with is thermal density lol. You're trying to prove to me that the successor to the 8700k is worse which is false. You can't  prove to me anything about the physical architecture as to why you think it can oc better. The 9900k uses the same 14nm architecture but further improved upon as you can see with higher cpu cache. In fact you probably don't even know about anything other than the cpu clock frequency to determine the cpu's performance. Given that the 9900k's architecture is the same 14nm as the 8700k but further improved upon and enhanced it is simply impossible for the 8700k to beat the 9900k in single core or multicore as the 9900k has a higher cache, better thermals due to solder and gold plating, and the fact that the z390 platform supports better communication between the cpu and onboard memory, shared memory, and ram. This is why 4.7ghz 9900k and 9700k is better than 5ghz 8700k. They are physically in a different ballpark. Please back up your statements with facts next time before you go challenging someone to prove you wrong.
---
The nice part of the Merch and tp is others can use the single use one whereas the infinite only you can use. 
---
&gt;I can't really say anything other than: you're pulling this out of your ass. You're assuming their intent without providing any actual evidence of whether they did something to look woke. 
---
And I can't really say anything other than you're likely just being disingenuous. You don't need to interrogate everyone at ArenaNet with a polygraph to be able to look at the trends and discern the obvious intent.
---
&gt;I've never seen them be performative about how they do representation at all.
---
Except the examples throughout the game's history (Kas &amp; Marjory, Sya), not to mention past PR from them on the topic of diversity, such as the women developers tweet.
---
Not that I have any objections to the tweet mind you, but it establishes a precedent and contributes towards the overall trend. To contrast another studio in the region, there was no similar media from Valve.
---
So it's entirely reasonable to say that ArenaNet are on board with diversity-as-marketing.
---
&gt;I'm assuming this person is Price? You can just come out and say it.
---
I'm not giving a sociopath the benefit of recognition. Said individual has bragged about their intent in the past, not to mention their history even beyond ArenaNet.
---
&gt;I see no connection between more gay people and work she did. The chances that she had impact on really minor character dialogue is low, she pretty much stated she was working on bigger pieces of the narrative, her job was not dialogue. ArenaNet has plenty of gay people working for them. Maybe, just maybe, they felt like representing themselves in a few characters here and there, and it had nothing to do with trying to look progressive or whatever other political thing. 
---
No, I think it's more a case of you *choose* to see no connection. The motivations are quite clear, most likely a confluence of diversity-as-marketing and rich straight white ultra-privileged Americans doing what they do best, using minorities as their own personal affectations. 
---
If a company like EA is on-board with the concept of diversity-as-marketing, we must be well over the hill for exploitation of that particular little scheme. Not that this concept is [original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaxploitation) in the first place.
---
**Blaxploitation**
---
Blaxploitation or blacksploitation is an ethnic subgenre of the exploitation film that emerged in the United States during the early 1970s. The films, though receiving backlash for stereotypical characters, are among the first in which black characters and communities are the heroes and subjects of film and television, rather than sidekicks or victims of brutality. The genre's inception coincides with the rethinking of race relations in the 1970s.
---
Blaxploitation films were originally aimed at an urban African-American audience, but the genre's audience appeal soon broadened across racial and ethnic lines.

I definitely think Ele matches almost all of your criteria except for burst damage, i'm pretty sure it has high sustained dps but isn't huge on "burst". Could be wrong on that though.
---
inb4 they fix a bug where we need to fail that event ;)
---
So why did Caithe remark that the commander and Aurene were in the trials for two days when the commander felt that it had been a fraction of that time?  That piece to me says there is some type of time manipulation happening. 
---
There's a new class...tried it...hated it.  Background char screen is different too...
---
what *do* they have for sale for you?
---
Mhh nice links. Did you click on the average overclocks on the top?
---
8086k: average on air: 5087 MHz. average on water: 5243 MHz
---
9900k: average on air: 5004 MHz. average on water: 5072 MHz
---
Nobody cares about sub ambient results for daily usage.
---
Ele does much better burst damage - at least on the s/d weaver I main, but that would get rid of the desired AoE attacks
---
Someone else suggested warrior, I think it‚Äôs a great choice for you to begin with.
---
If 4.7ghz 9900k outperforms 5ghz 8700k, then what makes you think 5.2ghz 8700k will outperform 5ghz 9900k? lol
---
Also, most of those on water are not even custom loops. A custom loop 9900k can comfortably go beyond 5.3ghz.
---
You can't.
---
There's gayness in every race
---
I haven't tried it, but I don't think that's how that works...
---
That's too bad. It's in sale for less than a boost alone. :(
---
Droedgipus?
---
Thanks for the tip! I'm trying to decide which class I'll focus on and let you know!
---
Hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I help a lot of people get back into the game. Easier than giving you a 4 year rundown here.
---
Your bf sounds like the type who doesn't want to take the scenic route. Tell him to go without a mount!
---
crossing fingers that its gonna be 2 greatswords like the vanilla game
---
The first time, yes
---
Haha I might, I keep mounting out of habit and then getting off as soon as I do, I think that‚Äôs part of where the jealousy comes in lol. I just have such a habit of mounting up now. 
---
Saying that all Power classes can Spike when Condition is Overtime isnt necessary true with all classes. To create a Spike Damage you need enough Low Casting Time Spells with High Damage Output to fuel your Burst. Classes like Power Renegade and Firebrand Power didn't have great Burst because all Skill that deal damage have significant Cast Time or not enough Damage.
---
On the other spectrum, Condi Firebrand can apply a lot of Burn with low Duration in a short amount of Time. I have done Opening in Fractal Bosses with Burn tick over 40k after 5 secs...
---
IMO, Burst build is better in Power due to Direct Damage vs Damage Overtime but tou must take into consideration the Skills that the build could use to burst.
---
I'd just like LS5 to surprise me.  I was hoping for an expansion or new elite specs instead of LS5, so I hope that whatever they have planned goes well for them. 
---
That kind of sad acceptance is honestly so much more heart wrenching than the stuff with Aurene. I think partially because it‚Äôs just so realistic. So many people deal with loss like this and react with just stoic acceptance and make a new life goal similarly. 
---
Plus it‚Äôs little things like that, that I can‚Äôt go into expecting and therefore partially preparing myself for. 
---
Have you completed the entire story on the character you‚Äôre trying to buy them with? I *think* that might be part of your problem if not. 
---
Thanks!
---
Are the dwarven chests character or account capped? It would be a pretty good farm if it was character 
---
Although I wouldn't recommend it. I'd say try to go for the natural, vanilla route so you get the mounts naturally as you progress through the story.
---
Trust me, it's an experience that you might not ever get.
---
It's good. Of these classes I would tell you that each specialization has its own perks, but it looks to me like your goal is to maximize AoE DPS. With that in mind, I'd have to say that Guardian is your best class, particularly the Dragonhunter specialization. The traps it unlocks are extremely powerful in PvE, not to mention the buffs the player gains on trap trigger. If you run Dragon's Maw with Procession of Blades and use some form of quickness with a greatsword and a longbow, you can do great things in PvE. For me personally, I've been using ascended/exotic gear on a Dragonhunter, with the combo I just described, and I'm pumping out very satisfying amounts of damage. And if you want a change of scenery, switching to Firebrand is very powerful as well, though they're mostly used for support, they have great potential for DPS.
---
As for Revenant, Elementalist and Engineer, while these classes are great, Elementalist lacks in DPS and instead is a more balanced class for casual players who want to survive, particularly Weaver and Tempest. Revenant core isn't a huge damage dealer, and both of its elite specializations are intended to be used for buffing. 
---
Engineer is also a very viable position for this, however. Scrapper is more of a tank-oriented specialization, but Holosmith has potential to deal ridiculous amounts of damage, the only downside being debilitating conditions that are used by many open world enemies. As long as you bring some condition cleanses, quickness buffs, and the middle Grandmaster trait (huge explosion on overheat further supported by Laser's Edge) you can deal a ton of damage.
---
Over all it's up to you, but I recommend Dragonhunter, Holosmith or Firebrand.
---
Why was this downvoted to hell? It's a perfectly reasonable argument. 
---
"Why are you booing me? I'm right!"
---
Omg I forgot what we were talking about and this definitely sounded nsfw
---
Glad you're at least enjoying it together though!
---
&gt; you dont wanna do 6 days of 2 events each on the new map content for your lovely new gear but you can stay weeks in Istan
---
I don't want to spend weeks farming *any* open world content. Istan blows anyway compared to fractals and raids in terms of gph
---
Guardian. No other class gave me the satisfaction of aoe dps than a DH. If u want a bit of everything, go FB. 
---
And then you can combine *that* one with eternity?? Yes??
---
Oh don't worry. Aside from legendaries, raid gear and mist trinkets *also* have time gates.
---
map was released with expansion which we are not getting. the whole map dedicated to 1 meta to kill a dragon that is.
---
Let break something down real quick. I'm going to be referring to Lotr style elves for the sake of things because they commonly the basis for fantasy elves. Elves in lotr traits include: They are wise, care for nature as an equal(few exceptions), tend to use magic based in nature. sound familiar? The only difference between Sylvari and elves is the fact that Sylvari are a young race and are legit plant life, thematically they are nearly identical....
---
Also you ask if Elves have ever existed in Tyria. According to lore, no. Personally I think the idea of Sylvari is more interesting than Elves in the first place.
---
But who wants exotic armor?
---
Lmao that does sounds soo horrible out of context. 
---
And me too. I‚Äôve played for 2 years, he finally is able to join me and I‚Äôm happy he at least wants to try it. 
---
Yes in single core performance, jeez. I'm still waiting for you to explain to me what it is physically inside the 8700k/8086k that makes it outperform the 9900k in single thread in your fantasy.
---
5ghz 8086k scores 219 in cinebench single thread: https://www.anandtech.com/show/12945/the-intel-core-i7-8086k-review/14
---
9900k stock 4.7ghz scores 220 in cinebench single thread: https://www.pcper.com/reviews/Processors/Intel-Core-i9-9900K-Review-Competition-Renewed/Media-Rendering-and-Encoding
---
I have, it‚Äôs great!
---
Sure. "Been there done that" on six years worth of characters? Zerging through Queensdale makes sense. 
---
But it's designed around being on foot and you definitely lose most of the flavor and intent of the the maps racing through them. The same way Elona is a brown empty wasteland while walking. Yeah, power creep makes a lot of the core maps easy now, but it's nowhere near as easy as being able to jackal-port past a tunnel full of dredge on your way to collect a hero point.
---
True! But if you're only in it for the jewels, the hidden chests are just a bonus.
---
Guardian is closer to ele playstyle and same HP / high damage but safer / funnier / easier.
---
DH is like a better version of Weaver with the bruiser style of play and FB is a way better version of Tempest with all the huge AoE damage and utility it brings. 
---
It's an elite fire elemental north-west of stone keep.
---
And then the commander stepped in and oneshot both of them at the same time. 
---
I don't expect anything. I'm hoping for more frequent raid releases and a new Fractal CM or two, but I certainly don't expect either of those to happen.
---
The replacement of Kralk confirmed to be us?
---
I think so ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Thanks for the links, those‚Äôll be useful 
---
It was nice to see something "russian" actually soviet in the game the first time I saw dredges long ago and especially now. Thanks that they are allies not enemies. And hi from Russia.  
---
I think i have seen it around the keep, after completing the north meta, near the shiny thing.
---
&gt;Grenth wasn't able to kill Dhuum
---
To be fair, how do you kill death himself?
---
Tl;dr Kralkatorrik is a Chronomancer that was never nerfed
---
&gt;Satisfying to master,aoe dps,flashy, fast attacks and high burst dmg.
---
Engineer. Holosmith is an amazingly fun elite spec that has solid condition and power builds. It has amazing burst and the rotations are fast and satisfying.
---
If you want something that's a bit easier to play, you could pick Guardian as Dragonhunter is an easy power DPS that also does very good burst. Firebrand is a decent condition DPS but it isn't meta anywhere like Holosmith and Dragonhunter are.
---
In the end though, I highly suggest getting level 80s of all of the classes when you can. It's very good to be flexible in this game and GW2 is fortunately very alt friendly.
---
To be fair, down Lava Font is op, since it's pre-nerf Lava font.
---
Thief has a portal skill?
---
Thank you! I searched all the high mountains and difficult to reach areas and even went to the heroic font to see if there was any hint.. but somehow failed to see the fire elemental right beside it..
---
I guess my comment sounded more argumentative than I had intended 
---
For raiding you don't need full ascended gear, so if someone wants to get into raiding, they can buy exotic armor for that purpose.
---
No, but raids do.  The White Mantle Portal Device obtainable from the Forsaken Thicket raids gives any class a portal, with a 30 minute cooldown.  Which is enough to allow me to offer patented ThiefPorts to people in need occasionally.
---
OPs username is "nobody cares", so he was saying thanks to OP. Went over a lot of heads, I think.

I personally run [this build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQJAsYhUMoshNNwkB8RsIAYBBgCwBQ4SeBqh3v6Z9tG-jhRBABmpE8q9HlfUq+De6BA4BAY8JAAA-e) on my weaver, sometimes changing Arcane Blast for Arcane Shield or even Primordial Stance.
---
Sandstorm (Glyph in Earth) is amazing for blinding mobs on a decent cooldown for how good it is. 
---
Overall the build is close enough to the meta raid build, but suits open world just enough for me
---
largos are just sentient skimmers ^^/s

I'd rather see Tengu; they have a ton of history in the world and could tie into either a Primordus or Cantha (or both) expansion...
---
- The Dominion of the Winds has a destroyer problem; we know this from the heart at the Dominion Killing Zone, 
---
- They were a race from the game before launch (wiki)
---
- they share their skeletons with Charr; meaning a lot of the animations and armor models could be lifted directly from Charr with only adjustments needed to make them "fit" (mostly Tails and probably some helmets)
---
I could see their implementation play out like this:
---
- the starting instance would be the middle part of the The Dominion Of Winds; the instance would play similar to LWS1's [Escape from Lion's Arch](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Escape_from_Lion%27s_Arch), but you're a Tengu helping your fellow birbs flee from Destroyers.
---
- it would end with the Tengu players fleeing the Dominion, appearing at [Titan's Staircase](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Titan%27s_Staircase).
---
- Their story would be continued through NPCs at [Hanto Trading Post](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hanto_Trading_Post) ^([lvl 10]) &amp; [Ireko Trade Camp](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ireko_Tradecamp) ^([lvl 20]), and the [Shuttered Gate](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shuttered_Gate) ^([lvl 30])
---
-From the Tengu story would tie into the base game story at level 30; where they join an Order.
---
They cannot return to the Dominion of the Winds until level 80; when the Tengu Specific expansion/Living World Season picks up.
---
After the Dominion of the Winds  story chapter comes out, the story can either go to Cantha ^(having lost their safe haven, the Tengu want to GTFO to far away from this dragon shit-show that's happening all over Central Tyria) or to the depths of Tyria (having worked together with the other races against Zhaitan, Mordremoth &amp; Kralkatorrik, they've realised together is better than alone, and they've enlisted the Pact's help to eradicate the Destroyers, and end this shit)
---
Wat. Stock single core boost for 9900k is also 5.0 GHz, not 4.7 GHz. So, at the same clock 9900k is marginal better in single core performance (1 CB point here), as I said before. This tiny advantage is easily lost when 8086k/8700k clocks 100 MHz higher, I linked you the bench in the video for that. I also showed you that on avergae 9900k doesn't overclock as good as a 8086k. I don't get why this is so hard to understand.

Tybalt, introduction!

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
More profitable to [buy certain exotics](http://www.gw2profits.com/equipment_salvage.php?order=buy_profit&amp;R=NNNYYY&amp;min_profit=1000&amp;min_percent_profit=20&amp;min_day_profit=100&amp;min_velocity=10&amp;gem_sale=100&amp;GoDM_price=0) and salvage them for runes, ectos, and sometimes inscriptions/insignias (depending on the exotic in question). 
---
I just hope its not a Chaos weapon with more effects
---
&gt;sadly i can't help you about its state in wvw bc i don't play that game mode.
---
In WvW it's one of the center points of zerging as Scourge, with two viable builds achieving the same goal. Boon corrupts and rips.
---
Reaper on the other hand is more a roamer, but I think it's on the more "balanced side" of things. Emphasis on the **I think**. I only ever see Minion Master Reapers who are obviously from PvP so ... xD
---
Yeah, but dedicated raiders who have been doing weekly clears for months have way more than enough ascended gear and magnetite (and relics for fractal players) lying around to get basically whatever they want immediately. While these resources are time gated, they're never made obsolete and can be stockpiled indefinitely. When a new stat comes out, they can throw resources they've already accumulated at it in order to bypass any content-specific grind.
---
I would know.
---
Sometimes we can't get over the fear, but we have to go anyway. 
---
............
---
I am going to fucking massacre Kralkatorric.
---
same happened to me today (23 kills total +5 more helping another guy). not sure why the plate is an RNG drop....

Check here for a lot.
---
I use Xephyr's Clarity from that thread.
---
There is also Zackgasm which is a very bright one with a lot of blur but it can be good for dark monitors and is great at night.

---
You can play around it by using your brain and it promotes having to play like a team instead of single player mode. I like it. 
---
Yes... Of course... Maybe the day they add orcs, goblins, taurens and so... Jesus why people want different games to become generic games. 
---
I don't know, but I think you should get whatever is advertised. So if you buy PoF and don't get the boost, contact support ant tell them ANet didn't deliver. I guess they will give it to you, if they didn't state otherwise regarding the PoF with boost.
---
Don't,  it's a waste. Just do PvP/WvW and you'll end up with lot of tomes of knowledge for leveling. 
---
They should disable mounts in core tyria like how they disable them in the story instances for core tyria.
---
Never capitulate!
---
Balance being one of the major issues with the game, my nail in the coffin was the rampant win trading of the top placed players in the ladders, in addition to ANETAs inability to revoke rewards (titles etc.), and give them the lightest slap on the wrist I‚Äôve ever seen in a game. 
---
This has been going on for so, so, so many seasons. This precious season included. Ranked PvP has been a joke for so long, as are the people who still show it those wintraded titles. If I could go back in time to launch week, I would, just to play with all my friends who have now quit the game/mode. 
---
Awesome, it was Nimmin, thanks a lot mate
---
oh, i checked the wrong user name xD
---
Something you'll never achieve.
---
This is a good thread. Side note, Vlast saw his own death and instead of fighting it, he made a variety of voicemails for his younger sister, Looked balthazar in the eyes and walked backwards into hell.
---
but i really like it
---
Ok, so what changed ?
---
Is the joke just that a god said ¬´¬†bless you¬†¬ª ?
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm missing anything
---
And I just hecking used a lvl 80 boost for that...
---
100 percent boon up-time 
---
Np dude.
---
Also a weird side point, the reason heal engi is not used for raids is purely because its source is basically the regen but it doesnt bring other amounts of buffs. Meanwhile tempest brings out regular heals/regen. Druid has spotter(crit chance flat buff to party) spirts (various buffs) in addition to great regen, actual heals, best might and fury uptime in game.   All of the healers feel differentISH enough. I can't really tell you the differences between healer rev/firebrand other than firebrand has more buff coverage but rene has some unique class only.   But to summarize a difference between tempest/druid/ healing scourge,  ..I guess...the differences between like  and i'm glancing off the top icy-veins here, how resto  druid suffers from  not being able to react(again if my info is wrong sorry), scourge works to mitiage  like"oh hey samarogs big damage skill is up, aaaannnnd, my allies got hit but its ok the barrier ate the damage" or "oh their dying and knocked away? np np transfusion their back and and i just rez'd them all at once choo choooooo".
---
That said druid is  veeerry strongly going to be still at least a singular  mandatory for a veeeeerrrry veeeeerry long time because it  simply..its bloated. It just really is. But thankfully because it covers 10 people with its buffs now its allowed 2nd healers that dont need to do its raw healing/regen.
---
What's the best way to help contribute hidden chest markers you didn't have yet?
---
It's bad game design that only hurts more casual players, as I said.  Random further explains this as well.  "They've done it before, so they have an excuse to do it again," isn't exactly a compelling argument. 
---
Dude if that really works, we can slowly convert Kralk's army into a Branded army which is effective against Kralk without Dragonblood weapons since they are already Branded in Kralk's crystals. 
---
Wiki EVERYTHING your not sure if before destroying! Things not become other things and those things become something else.. Idk if you have any of said things.. But it will save you the heartache abs support ticket later. 
---
I should have specified that yes, you still need the plate. I thought you meant that you just can't open chests in other rooms if all you do is port.
---
Yes the map is quite heavy with details and very populated
---
At least Diviners is on LS3 trinkets for some reason.
---
Is minion master reaper a thing in PvP? I've never seen them in my ranked matches (though I'm only Gold3 scrub)  and thought they were just a joke used by lazy players. 
---
Trading them for perms items would be amaaazing but I don't see ANet changing that anytime soon ..
---
For you maybe but not for all. For me it looks like you turn up red and blue to a point were you need sunglasses to watch it. Like a overtuned tv screen were someone went mad with the slider to a point were it hurts the eye. 
---
But for people who like colors on steroids then i guess Hook is a great tool. But yeah not for all :)
---
there a little line above hp,called boons.
---
EU
---
Even if it didn't boot you, you'd still need to go to the dwarf to cash in your deldrimor plate to reveal the serpentite chest.
---
How ever the exotics ones are very underwhelming so get those that looks pretty nice you will need to make the ascended.
---
Start over again and maybe fiddle around with your level 80 character on the side when you want to do something else. You just need to get in to the system again and understanding the combat the new elite specs and so on.
---
So... You can still go back and see baby Aurene?
---
You posted something on the internet so yes you did solicit criticism.
---
Technically speaking, yes. Mainly you'd be looking for leather drops from centaurs ([supply sacks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Supply_Sack) + [bloodstone warped hide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone-Warped_Hide) (season 3 episode 4)). However the farm in LS3E4 was nerfed and very few run it now. 
---
The real answer to your question though if you're looking for the most effective way would be gold. Do the best gold farm you can (Istan, silverwastes, even AB daily) and just convert that to gold to buy leather. [Shipment containers](https://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html) in Istan too.
---
That is not how RNG works. RNG is personal and do not depend on what others get.
---
I can't be of much help but Gods of PvP has some [guides](https://www.godsofpvp.net/guides/getting-started/introduction-r1/) and [builds](https://www.godsofpvp.net/builds/elementalist/) to look at. A lot of PvP is learning your opponents class and your own really well, then just practicing. 
---
Perhaps a seventh mount to blow my mastery points on. 
---
An exciting start into season 5. 
---
Super Adventure Box World 3. 
---
Getting more into fractals and raids. 
---
Finally finishing my final core Tyria mastery. Gods, the EXP I've wasted so far... 
---
Ya'know, I sadly hadn't thought of any of that. It makes so much sense! We've probably just been playing Kralk's game this whole time. Him allowing himself to get injured in that final instance was a calculated risk to get what he wanted. They said earlier in the episode that he can regenerate too, if I recall. So that means he basically lost nothing.
---
They could implement the skill pinging that was in place in Guild Wars 1. Then your character was saying wich skill you would cast next that way the party members knew what to do.
---
I always used that a lot and always helped coordinate the battle.
---
There is also set of trinkets and most likely backitems (be capes please).
---
This is why ESO's loot boxes are better. Every useless item can be turned into currency (Black Lion Statues) to purchase something you might actually want. Makes it MUCH easier to save up for something you want (especially with how many free loot boxes they give out).
---
Hey again, so I have been playing mesmer for the time since we last talked and did some t3 fractals and daily stuff and I can't stop feeling like the mesmer is not viable...
---
I see nearly no other Chronos/Mirages around and in fractals I have the feeling that my dps is the lowest of the group (Played power Chrono there)
---
Makes it hard for me to stay on maining onn my mesmer...
---
I had the same problem with my other classes (ranger, guardian, necro) 
---
I sthis something you just get used to?
---
As soon as the rewards are good, more maps is not bad.  
---
Power dps holo is quite solid. It brings enough utility that nobody will look down on you for being a few k dps short on for example a dh.
---
Survivability is okay. Better than weaver, not as good as a well played daredevil.
---
Rotation is quite easy and very straightforward. Actually quite similar to the rotations of bannerberserker and -warrior in that you have basically just 2 loops you keep repeating.
---
Sadly, no legendary effects on kits. But holokit looks nice as well ;)
---
Thats why I left this subreddit until I actually played the story for myself.  
---
I worked... 
---
I don‚Äôt know, but reality actually tends to be real - if you want real friends
---
You can ping boons in party chat once you cast them by CTRL-Clicking them from your buff bar line. I do that to signal "it's bankai time" for example ;) 
---
But most of the time if you're in a heavy duty guild you'll be in TS and someone will be running the show and asking for specific input.
---
For PUG fractals and such, yes it's true we could have something up but not essential.. 
---
I would prefer true UI customisation ... But that opens a huge can of worms sadly 
---
Biggest thing Kormir has done.
---
I love seeing that post every so often! Cheers 
---
It's pretty easy to build an open world soulbeast to have might and fury at 1500 range most of the time.
---
[This should help](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Weaver_-_Mender%27s_Sword#Usage)
---
&gt; and I'm pretty much dead weight
---
Welcome to ele! Get used to it or reroll, Anet shows no interest in making this class useful after more than 1 year of being garbage.
---
At least many of the PoF sets are available as rewards from the PvP/WvW reward track
---
In this line there's random lights that appear every every now and then with no warning for 2 seconds. Usually in big fights 10+ of these  appear, most of them have no meaning because basically 'everything' is happening for 2 seconds all the time.
---
I'm saying this isn't really meaningful information.
---
&gt;1. There is no in-game economy to trade items.  
---
To me, this is a terrible point. How does it make it better to force you to spend real money? 
---
&gt; 2. You get the crates/boxes for free whenever you level up which you do by just playing the game. 
---
Have you played GW2? A game in which you get keys for free as (extremely rare) random drops and as a reward for levelup/map completion? 
---
I'm really happy to see some friendly Dredge for once.  I find their lore quite interesting and its easy to miss if most of them won't talk to you.  
---
If you keep on calling people trash in any shape or form you can come up with just because they do not want to be the hard core player you prefer, will only catch a lot less players who could maybe get interested in improving but after hearing all that trashtalk they turn away. Social skills can be a good thing to have if you want to reach out to more players and get a improvement.
---
Can confirm.  Short/thin body type male norns have these issues a lot.
---
Holo feels veery strong in open world. Aoe and burst dmg, together with sustain are great(tho i use kittless sword/shield for that). Raiding wise, rotation is at the same time complicated, but easy(rifle+bomb+grenade). It requires you to constantly switch between 4 skill bars, plus toolbelt skills and using 2-3 skills from each of those off cooldown(which makes rotation list pretty lenghty). The thing is that its hard, but forgiving if you dont do it in exact lineup. If you decide to level holo natural way, try using the same build and already on the path youll learn most of rotation(or you could atleast do like 10 levels naturally). I also play thief with derp rotation, but mistakes are not forgiving. It actually took me cca 30 minutes on training golem to get a grasp of rotation, and 1 raid run to implement that in boss fights(on holo). You also pack so much  aoe damage that you wont believe it. 
---
DE rifle is good in open world, but not my cup of tea. I find daredevil much better, although alot of people find DE rifle the best(dunno why). Dps wise, it is still there in tops of benchmarks, but they did those benchmarks in kneeled stance, which in reality, on bosses, you wont use that much since you cant stay rooted in one position all the time. On the plus note, its a ranged dps so you wont lose dps in moments when you need to move away from boss, like when you would need to move using dagger or staff builds. 
---
Another important note is, if you decide to go holo, you will actually rarely have your rifle out during combat. Rifle is there just to throw 2 skills and switch back to holo/kits. Thats the main reason id rather op for deadeye, since youll have that sweet rifle out all the time, and youll still find your use in raids, and even more in fractals. 
---
Even so, I'm pretty sure that a smell- and hearing-based race could easily tell the difference, as plants do have scents and humans are stinky creatures.
---
I use the latest reshade, so not sure whats available on GW2Hook.  Regardless, post process off of course, DPX for added brightness, Ambient Light for a nice sense of atmosphere and Adaptive Sharpening which makes the game look higher resolution.  Pretty bare bones but the game feels much more realistic to me this way than with all the dramatic level adjustments and unnatural saturations.  
---
Nice then, thanks !
---
What are the utilities you are talking about ? CC ?
---
And are you sure about the rotation, cuz when i look on SC, it looks like piano Weaver to me xD.
---
I imagine humans smell like humans (blech) and charr smell like cat-hyaenas and asuras smell like shark-rat people and norn smell like giant tankards of ale.
---
I'd LOOOOVE to be able to trade Black Lion Boosters/Revive Orbs/Repair Canisters for Statuettes.
---
I dont get any sms notification that someone else is trying to log into your account.
---
This comment shows how degenerate you are. There no point in discussion.
---
Love it! Do you plan on doing this for all of Dragon's Watch?
---
just use the dedicated patch bug sticky for evidence and exposure:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/adx8ul/patch_bug_thread_8_january_2019/
---
That's only for veterans, though. There's a lot of stuff to plow through before you get to that point, and then you're expecting more from a small publisher than you really should expect, imo. 
---
If you want faster content updates, you will probably want to play on a game like WoW, which has a much bigger studio and a lot more revenue from monthly subs + xpac fees + cash shop stuff, vs smaller ANet that only does xpacs + small cash shop.
---
Stone age engine. Ooga booga.
---
I'd just like to point something out, now that we know about Kralkatorrik's visions. 
---
In *Edge of Destiny,* it's explicitly stated that the plan to kill Kralkatorrik failed because Logan left to save Jennah. Without him guarding the entrance to Glint's Lair, the Branded were able to reach Snaff and kill him, which in turn allowed Kralkatorrik to kill Glint and escape. If Logan had been in position, Snaff wouldn't have died, and Rytlock would have had a clean shot at Kralkatorrik with the spear. 
---
Now, we have new information that completely changes the context of the fight: **Kralkatorrik had foreknowledge of Glint's plan to kill him before it was set into motion.** He knew what was waiting for him at Glint's Lair, and he could have used that foreknowledge to change the outcome of the fight. 
---
**The attack on Ebonhawke wasn't a fluke. Kralkatorrik attacked Ebonhawke deliberately, because he knew it would lure Logan away from the fight.** 
---
That part of the vision where we see Aurene on a pedestal and everyone cheering.
---
Is that the twist?
---
That is actually Kralkkie trapped in her body and everyone happy about it because big, purple gem dragon is now Aurene with an eyepatch?
---
Aha but you misunderstand the specific phrasing used! 
---
While it is true that Glint and Aurene cannot see past their deaths, Kralkatorrik's vision is specifically a 'world without him', not a vision of his death. 
---
This makes the idea of incapacitating him by trapping him in the mists more plausible, he is no longer in the world but is no longer dead. Therefore it is a 'world without him' that he could still potentially envision, his devouring of the mists may actually be him trying to erase the potential place he could be imprissoned, we've seen how depserate he is to stop that vision coming to pass.
---
The drying up of armor skins is especially galling considering that I came from GW1, which has a lot of beautiful armor skins to collect (especially for the time), and also that this turned me into an armor collector. And three, you can't, unlike GW1, wear your own helms with outfits.
---
"I don't know."
---
*queues up the deafening silence*
---
That's it for me. The reward stuff popped up, and I didn't care - stunned by how well the ending played out, and then the silence that continued on. My character didn't shout anything (thank goodness I wasn't on my Chrono - the last thing I needed to hear was that I was faster than a centaur as some random boon popped). It was incredibly well-done.
---
We all have a forbidden love for Logan. Doesn't count. 
---
Spoilers: Watched the cutscene where this guy gets chomped and he does, in fact, send out a shockwave explosion‚Äîsomething that happens when dragons/gods are killed, and also happens when Balth consumes someone‚Äôs power, which is only something I‚Äôve read and not witnessed. I‚Äôm sure he mentions it, but honestly, I‚Äôve forgotten. 
---
So hmmm, does Aurene consumes Joko‚Äôs lich-revival-style power? Who knows.
---
What is your theorycrafted diviner build? Genuinely asking, i am very interested in the new stat.
---
Each of the collections has three side objectives which, when completed, give you an invisible reward of the same name as each achievement.  Obtaining these three gives credit for the three deeds which then advances the collection.  The focus collection cannot be completed because [two of the objectives give the same reward and the third cannot be obtained](https://youtu.be/b8MVlzMFmKA), halting the collection from advancing.  
---
Already submitted a bug report but posting here for video evidence and exposure.  
---
"Great story I'm literally crying" means that to you?  
---
Cool.  Stay off the internet then. 
---
I find it absolutely entitled that this subreddit expects people to not talk about the newest hot stuff with their fellow players because a bunch of entitled cunts are browsing reddit crying SPOILERS instead of playing the fucking thing. I will never ever watch for spoilers while those same people don't take the steps to protect themselves first. Until those entitled cunts turn off their chats and stay away from reddit for a day I won't ever give a flying fuck about you and your experience that you clearly don't care about yourself. 
---
 /gg community enjoy the spoilers 
---
Im gonna copy paste my comment from other thread down here. But firstly, dont start over, just start devouring wikipedia :). Wiki anything and everything you come up with. Here is the paste from a thread, where a guy asked what should he prioritize doing other than story line:
---
Since i was in a completely same position couple of months ago, ill write you some notes, other than just finishing story.
---
First of all- masteries. Its that golder (level) number next to player portraits, which goes up to 278 max. They are divided into core, hot (hesrth of thorns) and pof(path of fire)
---
You need to fill up experience bar and use mastery points to level them up. Both points and exp are gained individually in core and expansions. In order to level a pof mastery, you need to do content in pof expansion to get pof experience, and get pof masteries aswell. Same for other 2. Refer to youtube and wiki for guides on getting em.
---
Core masteries-if you plan on doing fractals, you would want those. Fast revive also comes really handy and should aim on getting that one.
---
Pof masteries- you can get raptor soon after getting into pof and id suggest you to get raptor asap before anything else. I could also say that springer(2nd mount) is also important so you can aim for that aswell. Refer to wiki on to how to get it, but youll need to level raptor a bit more till you get longer jump. If you want to venture further, you can also go for springer jump.
---
Hot masteries-lots of these are important for making your life easier and also getting certain achievements like ascended weapons. 
---
Specializations- each class has 2 new specializations. See which one you want and try to farm skill points in hot and pof to unlock atleast one of them for the beggining. You need 25 hero points for this. I would also put this under highly needed upgrade for beginning.
---
Ascended gear- highest quality gear(same stats as legendary) which you will need to advance in fractals. Why? Higher level fractals yield more reward, but require agony resistance(AR). Now what is and how do i get AR? AR is special stat that reduces passive damage in fractals. Without it you cant even enter tier2+ fractals. To get AR, you need to infuse your ASCENDED gear with it(usually each item with +9, up to 150). Exotic gear cannot be infused.
---
How to get ascended gear so i can advance in fractals?
---
Easy to get:
---
 -rings from fractal vendors for fractal currency
---
-heart of thorns living season episode 3 unlocks a zone where you can get materials and spend them at a vendor to buy 1 accessory, backpiece, diving helment and ring.
---
-from laurel merchants get yourself a necklace and if you have much more laurels, you can spend em on second accesory. 
---
This should give you all the trinkets(6 of them) in ascended netting you around 54 agony resistance.
---
 
---
- weapon - easiest to get from the caladbolg quest by finishing heart of thorns personal story and doing couple more collections, not really a fuss. You can get 1 item only, choosing between sword, dagger, greatsword, shield and 1 more item i dont know which one. To get a second weapon, finish hot again on another character. You can also switch between these any time you want for small commission. For this, refer to dulfy caladbolg guide
---
Other easy go get weapons are from specialization collections(under achievement tab) but will require you getting couple of masteries before, so you can leave this for some later time.
---
Hard to get- armor. How? (Expensive )Crafting, cheaper crafting + fractals, cheaper crafting+pvp or raiding. So if you want medium armor, youll need leather worker, armorsmith for heavy and tailoring for light. Only raids allow you to get it withoug crafting. You can also get it from fractals, but drop chances are awfully low. 
---
Each zone in expansions has it respective vendors and currency. Usually these zones have meta events, which you will want to do for experience for masteries and to get currency to buy rewards. Dont spend these currencies just like that, cuz there will be a moment youll need em(like in before mentioned specialization collections for ascended weapons).
---
These are some main points youll want and need and how to get em. Feel free to ask questions or correct me if i made a mistake somewhere. 
---
End of paste.
---
Wait, there is new xpac in GW2? 
---
I don't think that the rifle build on DE is viable on Fractals, plus i don't really like the playstyle that involves you being rooted in place and spamming skill 3 during the whole encounter lol.
---
And yeah, i'm aware of that about Holo, but heh... don't really have a choice. 
---
The living story episodes are free on release then cost 200 gems if you missed it, with a 20% discount if you buy the whole season at once. You can unlock them in the gem store.

Think of it like catching an episode on TV for free but needing to buy the DVD box set if you want to go back and watch the last season. 
---
LS2 has a complex story but no new maps.
---
LS3 has an okay story and each episode has a new map, popular because they're unique and have easily gotten ascended accessories. You need HoT to play it.
---
LS4 (episode 5 just came out so is unlocked for free forever if you log in around now) has new maps, a new mount and a storyline that is either emotionally manipulative or dramatically epic, depending on how you feel about it. You need PoF to play it. 
---
Yes it did mean that because anyone with an IQ over 60 could tell it was Taimi or Aurene dying if anyone was getting upset. As for the rest of your rant, you sound like a fucking charming character. Real cream of the crop of the gw2 community mate. Keep on being a fuckwit.
---
Yes.  However, stun-breaks are much more common in sPVP. 
---
So I think there might be unofficial reason for this.
---
Until we started heading into expansion territory, the commander hasn't done superhuman feats. Yes, they are indeed very capable and strong even during the early personal story. But for the big moments during the personal story, we were pretty much leading zergs to defeat the enemy. The fight with zhaitan wasnt even really a true show of our physical strength, but rather shooting cannons until he died.
---
Season 1 and 2 didnt have any powerful foes we had to fight, other than the Shadow Dragon. Yes, we were able to hold our own against the dragon lutenient the first time, but we werent enough to kill it and it took a second time with all of Dragons Watch to kill it.
---
It wasn't until HoT where we started fighting unusually powerful enemies. Mordremoths Lutenients, Faolin, MoM, and Modremoths Mind. What also happened during HoT? We secured the safety of Glints legacy, Aurene.
---
What if us being her Champion is more than just a title?
---
As quoted from the GW2 wiki "The most powerful dragon minions are known as "champions", or lieutenants".
---
What also does the wiki state about dragon champions?
---
"Dragon champions are of themselves extremely powerful, but they also tap into the inexhaustible power of their lords."
---
What if the commander is Aurenes Champion like how other Dragons have Dragon Champions?
---
It would make sense. How else would a sylvari character be able to withstand Modremoths voice deep in his mind? How else would we be able to best an recently awakened Lazarus with an old relic?
---
Balthazar was the odd one. He was the first time the commander lost a fight, and it ended with death. Even with Sohothin, it takes the wielder to win not just a weapon. What if the reason Balthazar lost was not only because of us using Sohothin but also because being next to Aurene, who was both powered up by the 2 dead elder dragon energies, gave us more of a boost in strength since we were so close to her?
---
It explains the Commanders sudden rise in feats of strength since HoT; being able to kill fallen gods, the mind of an elder dragon, and bloodstone empowered mesmers that could reshape the surrounded reality.
---
But if the commander is the champion of a technical elder dragon, why are they just like any member of their race mentally and physically instead of a monstrosity or any sign of physical change?
---
Maybe because either Aurene was too young to make them a full fledge champion? It makes sense, seeing Caithes transformation in the latest episode after being touched by a more grown Aurene. Ot maybe because Aurene is a potential elder dragon that is purified, just like Glint.
---
Maybe it's because when the commander was turned into Aurenes champion, instead of getting a sudden power boost, the  commanders potential in strength was raised exponentially. This way, they could not get corrupted by the power boost if they worked naturally to it.
---
I'm not sure, but I'm really intrigued by this theory.
---
yae, used griffon on the boss fight and got stuck in crystals, had to re-start from closes checkpoint
---
Parting ways is much better than killing them off because they can still exist as part of the game world. They can help out during specific plot points they are relevant, or even appear in side stories like Lord Faren often does.
---
I would love if Rox continued to appear during festivals, especially festival of the four winds, where Olmakahn have a presence.
---
/w [Taunt](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Taunt)
---
Can we also appreciate he's a sniper who, as a Dredge, has very poor eyesight.
---
i thought the same 
---
&gt; She's dead, but continues to help from the mists? That's fine because Glint died and lives on in the mists. 
---
I mean... in a way. 
---
Glint still exists in the Mists, but death changed her, as it changes everyone in the setting. She's a spirit now, and that's a pretty substantial downgrade. She doesn't have a physical body anymore, and she no longer has the gift of prophecy she once enjoyed. 
---
Her death *did* have meaning, and it *did* have consequences. If Aurene came back into the narrative the same way, she'd still be unable to fulfill her role in Glint's Legacy, because death deprived her of the abilities she'd need to properly replace an Elder Dragon. 
---
Death isn't cheap in this setting. Certainly malleable, but not cheap. 
---
It‚Äòs called ‚Äúmaking a baby character cute and adorable for marketing without considering functionality‚Äù
---
Outfit coming soon to a gemstone near you.
---
New feature: story-only mastery!
---
But you saved all that time that you'll never get back, trust me.
---
They literally could have been crying from happiness. There's no implication in that title the ending is bad it's your assumption.  Riddle me this fuckwit,  why are you on reddit reading threads when the patch hit live and anybody with an IQ over 60 knows 99% of them are gonna be about the patch?  I am dying to know why aren't you to blame for your own experience but instead a person who wrote "I'm crying". 
---
At least not only do I not spoil anything I also don't go at people because I was too stupid to stay away from social media like a junkie for 24h. 
---
My logic is VERY simple mate,  if somebody cares about spoilers they would stay off of the reddit,  turn off map chat etc.  If they don't do any of it then they quite obviously don't give a shit. 
---
I'll gladly spoil every patch from now on until you and the other entitled babies learn how to avoid spoilers and who's job it is to protect your own experience.

---
Like actually funny, but not real pornographic material \^\^
---
"Commander... there was no other way."
---
We thought we were doctor strange but it was kralkatorrik the whole time! He saw a single future in which he wins but he had to sacrifice an eye to achieve it!
---
More maps is fine so long as they have longevity, goals to work towards and engaging gameplay loops. Even something as simple as the Bitterfrost Frontier berry farming loop can be satisfying and keep players involved and coming back.
---
However, the issue with the PoF and LS4 maps is that they don't do that very well. LS3 certainly had the advantage with desirable gear stats and HoT has rewarding metas but the PoF maps don't have either of those and you can end up with barren and lifeless maps like Domain of Vabbi, Domain of Kourna and Thunderhead Keep all too easily.
---
I think the PvE content that actually benefits any MMO the most are dungeons/fractals and raids - so long as they have an accessible difficulty - since they will be repeated for a long time as we see with Spirit Vale and the original fractals. That isn't for everyone though so we need a good mix of instanced content, new maps and new metas but they need to be worthwhile otherwise they end up like Serpent's Ire/Vabbi. 
---
You're not meant to climb it-- it's the end of a flight path that will superspeed your griffon downhill.

Hmm...

---
Hmmmm...
---
Personal preference, both are strong.
---
No elves please. Just play sylvari, they are close enough.
---
Emm I think there will be a change to the release schedule to every 1 to 2 months. I think we will get more than one new mount. A new set of Elite specs this will show living world can do what expansions can do. I expect the WvW updates in the summer and an announcement that season 1 will be implemented and thats what the expansions team is working on hence season 4 to 5.
---
Yes, that would indeed be her.
---
It would be a cool heavy set. But it‚Äôs an outfit.
---
You know, if they‚Äôre gonna keep on adding outfits at least make them something that you could not achieve with armor. Bc this thing would work easily as an actual armor set.
---
We need to kill Kralky because he is bloody super powered if we don't the mists will be destroyed and so will Tyria.
---
I've got to say, this is actually legitimately brilliant if true.  That is some amazing "foreshadowing" that no one ever saw put in motion so long ago by the writing team if so.

Cheeky humble brag about having a permanent hair kit eh?
---
Would be nice if you could just buy statuettes with black lion consumables, even if they cost multiple of those items.
---
Yes and they are rarely seen.
---
Reason being stunbreaks and stability are everywhere in pvp.
---
But don't be discouraged from using Taunt if it complements yur playstyle, it's as good as any CC.
---
Can someone recommend some good "inbetween" gear for a beginner druid? Something that is both at least decent for open world, and for starting to practice support in fractals. Basically, I'm just dumping my fresh level 80 ranger into the jungle to start training the specialization, and need a good exotic set for that. (investing in two different sets and ascended gear is a longer term goal...)
---
Yes.
---
But Taunts aren't really seen cos they either require the player to trait it or run some less popular build
---
The problem is that you can‚Äôt active two PoFs on the same account
---
Their just called Asura.
---
Well probably only get one more fractal this year (because we already just got one). But if they stick to their schedule it will be 2 more raid wings and one more fractal
---
Glad this helps you out! Thanks for working on the wiki. :)
---
Probably gonna get one more fractal this year cause we already just got one and maybe 2 more raid wings
---
Personal opinions on classes 
---
- Satisfaction in mastering: ele/engi&gt;rev&gt;&gt;guard  
---
- Aoe coverage: tempest&gt;weaver (depends on build, can be a lot lower)&gt;engi/guard&gt;rev  
---
- Flashiness: weaver/holo&gt;tempest/rev (any spec)/firebrand&gt; scrapper/dh  
---
- Speed of attacks: rev&gt;guard/engi&gt;&gt;ele  
---
- Burst: holo/dh&gt; firebrand/weaver/tempest&gt; rev (yes I'm aware of ele benchmarks but 15+ seconds under effects of buffs that you cant reproduce by yourself dont really qualify as burst).
---
Thanks. I was going to make the focus but I'll do another weapon first now.
---
A dozen is 12, not 24.
---
Can't we not post spoilers in a non-spoiler thread?
---
I guess Zafirah's gonna replace her in Dragon's Watch. This might make dor some interesting interpersonal dynamics, if Zafirah will be still bitter about the fact that we killed Balthazar (and actually inadvertently caused all the crap we're in now in the first place).
---
Unless the reward are somewhat balanced between these maps as well as good enough compared to the rest of the game, the winner takes all and the rest can continue to struggle for replayability. 
---
Being able to sit in chai- wait a minute!
---
ooh, why don't we add Kung Fu fighting panda bears, too?
---
NOPE, just nope
---
Which is why you ask them to come to your map and offer a tip.
---
You can log out / tp to friend from some parts of the room so it's not too big of an issue
---
I don't use any addons.
---
Thats just because the writers couldn‚Äôt give the commander too much of a personality because its an mmorpg /s
---
But Largos are anthropomorphic animals too...
---
I'll preface this by saying, I'm not a fan of Arena Nets current business model so I'm probably a bit bias. But I'm struggling to digest some of her opinions, primarily those related to player feedback and feedback collection.
---
If we look at Digital Extremes, the developers of Warframe, they constantly seek [direct feedback](https://twitter.com/sj_sinclair/status/1081641917002194950) and host "Dev Streams" in which they answer questions and show off upcoming [micro-transactions](https://www.twitch.tv/warframe/clip/VictoriousSpeedySmoothieTheTarFu) while reading live reactions. This is the most direct form of open feedback I can think of. The community manager will even [pressure the developers live](https://youtu.be/HA_o8sSrWCE?t=1565) about any system that has had negative reception. The playerbase gets to experience the [human side](https://www.twitch.tv/warframe/clip/CarefulBadMonitorOMGScoots) of the development process and they have thus cultivated an environment where the players [trust](https://twitter.com/sj_sinclair/status/1081273876842233866), forgive, [laugh with](https://www.twitch.tv/warframe/clip/PerfectPhilanthropicPlumageDoubleRainbow), and [openly discuss](https://twitter.com/GooseDE/status/1071160290606223361) with those responsible for the implementation of the games systems/monetization. They have even begun going so far to sell [fan made cosmetics](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=230410) with a sizable portion of the sales going to the artists responsible. So while the company and their methods may not be perfect by any means I do believe they are adequate proof against her claims that players are incapable of talking about micro-transactions. For example, [this](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1044714-mesa-prime-access-surprise-new-item-in-prime-accessories/) is a result of monitoring [player feedback](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1043490-lets-discuss-the-mesa-prime-accessory-pack/) prior to the release of a micro-transaction bundle.
---
On the flip side, it's hard to care about a developers needs when we have no connection with them. The first and last time I was on the guild wars 2 official forums I had a comment removed and I was issued a warning. My comment was talking about my joy for a particular bow mechanic from guild wars 1, the warning entailed "Guild Wars 2 is not Guild Wars 1 keep the discussion on topic". This type of [censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7bupa0/another_example_of_ridiculous_moderation_on_the/) makes it feel like there isn't much way to reach the developers with civil discussion, so what's left besides throwing salt? On the topic of loot boxes, they had to have known prior to implementing the adoption licenses what the public opinion would have been. Despite this they went ahead with "testing" the model and almost certainly got positive sales data. However this caused backlash which [Mark O'Brien](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/15523/a-message-about-the-mount-adoption-license) then had to deal with. Had we had a more direct communication on the idea of loot boxes the response would have undoubtedly been no, as Chrystin predicts in the primer, but would it have been a completely negative outcome as she claims? I'm not sure, it probably would have hurt their potential income but if the Digital Extremes examples above exhibit anything, it's that transparency goes a long way in figuring out exactly what players want before making a poor decision.
---
Also somewhat relevant to the forum censorship issues, when users went to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/a2cl2q/something_needs_to_be_done_about_the_rampant_mod/) over abusive moderation in warframe the developers personally responded with [this](https://youtu.be/WV-HoxYP6hs?t=570).
---
Sorry, as a huge fan of Guild wars 1 that has been fully discontent with the monetization system in Guild wars 2 this struck a bit of a sour spot for me. This was way longer and I had to force myself to trim quite a bit of it. Commence with the downvotes due to differing opinions.
---
If we want to go full galaxy brain, there is another creature in Tyria that keeps messing around with timelines. 
---
It keeps jumping from time loop to time loop and affecting the outcome of notable events that happened in specific areas at specific times. It is not trapped, It does it for his own entertainment and for the sake of acquiring powerful artifacts and gain renown for his own accomplishments. It is not alone ,there are at least 3 millions of them and have been doing this for the last 6 years, while more keep joining them.
---
Amen.
---
I love Sergei. Did the adventure and after that I just spent time there, listening to him. The details in this game are incredible! 
---
Is that what that's for? I saw it after the meta the other day and then when I brought a crystal there, nothing happened.
---
It should be able to salvage ascended as well, its a "cash shop item" q.q
---
He and Almorra need to sit down and share an ale or two.
---
Too bad it's another Outfit, I want the pants with the belts. :(
---
So I hit a weird situatiion where in the Dragon's Blood storyline I have to destroy two crystals. However, they do not appear on my minimap. No indication as to where to go. If I leave Thunderhead I can see it but as soon as I come back: nothing. I even set a personal marker and when I get to the area there are no crystals. Thanks for any help.
---
That reminds me. I am absolutely livid on how bigger pauldrons magically hoover over a norn character's shoulders, or when hip protecting plates also stick out as if they were floating - best example, stag chausses on the thinnest male norn body option.
---
Not to mention the terrible grip on one handed swords that every character has when they wield it in combat. I would really love to hear the reasoning behind our characters holding the grip closer to the pommel instead of the cross-guard of a sword.
---
And now the hackers who scan Reddit looking for you know exactly which sites they can hack via your PWD and login details 
---
Mwuahah all part of my mischievous plan! 
---
/Tinfoilhat off 
---
It's going to be the generic level 1 greatsword, but yellow.
---
But she was hurt badly before that.
---
The rewards are good, imo, albeit grindy. You get ascended pieces, I only know of Silverwastes and Dragon's Stand doing that.
---
TFW you have to turn your graphic settings to "best performance" to get playable FPS, while having to put on headphones and turn the volume to the max so you don't have to listen to your fans spinning like mad, trying to prevent your PC from melting. Good times.
---
So that‚Äôs why I was top 2...
---
Just the sharpen option made fall in love with it. It is a must have.
---
It also never hurts to have more of a supply of Globs of Dark Matter. I seem to spend those just as fast as I make them. :(
---
But they must of had a plan surely? I'm sure they had created a very rough timeline when starting developing GW2. Key events would have certainly had been marked down and creating a dragon egg as well as what would be the purpose of the dragon that comes out of it seems pretty key to me. Dealing with elder dragons and gods also are pretty key facts. Even if they hadn't refined story and details back then I'm sure they had a specific timeline and story in mind to base the story and events and expansions around. The story is planned out at least 1-2 years in advance so it's not impossible.
---
Well, for an Asura Human legs *are* big...
---
i guess she doesnt care anymore
---
Some Quaggan are worthless, sure. But the hot tub tender in Bitterfrost Frontier is my favorite NPC out there. I can't find her line, but it's fantastic.
---
The DNA results just came in.....
---
Sadly he doesnt go that far
---
I prefer the original graphic.
---
Absolutely retarded it's not guaranteed.
---
Anet refuses to fix it, meaning it's intentional. What the fuck, Anet.
---
It's probably bugged atm, seems like it only gives the plate to the player dealing the killing blow
---
and why couldn't we have a kralk xpac (besides "i don't want one?")
---
Why did they leave though? Haven't had a working desktop for a while so I've missed/forgot stuff.
---
Thats what clued me in so i lost the inpact
---
Not so long ago I used like 100 bl keys and I got more than 20 hairstyle kits. I already have perma one, so it was really a waste of keys... I sent a ticket explaining the situation and they gave me 5 BL keys.
---
I suggested them the same thing that OP, but they told me they cant make them stop dropping even if we have the perma contracts.
---
what?
---
They are? What animals?
---
She is... :/
---
Could be an omssion for "\[I\] bless you.", but being blessed so directly would be a bit much for our humble Kasmeer.
---
check out the light HoW shoulders on norn :D
---
even the legendary and brave among us!
---
&gt; Me and my friend 
---
i think this makes a world of difference! 
---
Thanks! I guess anything goes for just practicing the rotation, so I will stick with dps gear for now. Though I saw some ranger builds with condition damage but I'm still inexperienced about that and don't know if I should bother with it, but I'm also curious about trying. I think I could craft either berserker's or sinister/carrion for roughly the same cost, or get berserker's for karma, so that's what I should figure out...
---
Stingray
---
I wonder if he thinks the author of that comment is a professional commenter who's soliciting criticism...
---
I‚Äôd give you gold for this if I had the money to spare. Awesome theory!
---
How? On NA, a person known to use 3rd party hacks has the number one spot which I thought was a teleport hack.
---
I was letting people know only but I think the reason they stopped doing them here is because it doesn't seem as ''official'' as hosting them in their own website...? they did state the reason somewhere in the past before they revert from reddit to forums.
---
Dormamu, I‚Äôve come to bargain!
---
The only others that have been solo'd are Cairn, and Slothasor. Desmina escort too if you count that I guess
---
Doubt they would ever come back here in any organized way until people grow up. 
---
I read somewhere that the graveling must not be killed on it's spawn location, or else it doesn't spawn. It also took me ~15 kills until I read about the possible solution and then it worked. Got only 5 minutes left of the buff for all the other rooms.
---
What did I did wrong. I am not a bot,??
---
All the contracts are inconsistent and have been complained about for years but I completely agree. 
---
Don't actually need to borrow if you have beetle unlocked.
---
Yes, the *instance owner* must be level 80 - the lower level player(s) joining to unlock the mount don't. The players joining also do not need to have Path of Fire story marked as their active story instance, just joining is enough.
---
I know the circle jerk is hating the new bow. But do realize that it's your opinion. I think it's really nice.
---
It's kind of like all the joke legendaries. I hate pretty much all of them. I don't whine about it, I'll simply just avoid making them myself.
---
The shattering of the bloodstone,for example.
---
The devs debunked the fact that Gods are opposites of Dragons as in good and evil,but their spheres of influence tend to overlap,and that s just something you can t deny.
---
Pretty much everything relates Kralkatorrik to chaos,since he s the most destructive and aggressive of dragons,and especially since he revels in mind controlling anything and everyone.
---
EDs also vary in power based on what they consume,since they managed to rule over the other EDs s domains after absorbing some of their magic. Nothing says gods did not work likewise.
---
The gods saying that their conflict would destroy Tyria makes 0 sense since they never even tried anything about it. They just up and left. They also state fighting EDs is bad. They never said replacing them would have consequences.
---
Abaddon s Death really didn t do much since Kormir was there to absorb most of his rampaging magic,so that s off the charts.
---
Balthazar was already being opposed by part of the WM under his guise as Lazarus. He was again opposed by us until we find out he was Balthazar in disguise. And we kept opposing him since. Past all that,he still gave us a chance to join him,presumably due to respect for our strenght,since he clearly didn t need us to bitchslap Kralk.
---
Balthazar was caged for disagreeing with the Gods s Exodus and their idleness towards the EDs. He literally calls them weak cowards and swears to strike them down as well if they do not help him.
---
The dev can say what he likes,it contraddicts the Living Story itself,so i m taking the LS for it. He also wanted to fight yes,and add the ED power to his own. But the entire reason he was struck down by the other gods was due to him wanting to join the fray.
---
He clearly cared,going as far as to challenge 5 other gods.
---
Also,Living among humans in disguise isn't exactly much. Neither is stopping 1 war. Abaddon was more into humans yes,with the magic gifting and all,but i can bet you 20 bucks no human prayed to Dwayna,Abaddon and Lyssa in their darkest times.
---
Call it bias all you like,the fact is PoF was rushed and the commander made stupid decisions. Also sorry for the structure of my reply,i have no idea how to highlight what part i am replying to.
---
Nothing that I mentioned has been confirmed directly; they're just theories that I subscribe to.
---
Regarding the Pale Tree's lineage, the wording of Wynne's line, 'We come from the jungle dragon. We belong to it.' appears to establish a connection between sylvari and Mordremoth that only the Pale Tree can bridge. If sylvari 'come from' Mordremoth despite being created by the Pale Tree, doesn't that strongly suggest that the Pale Tree also 'comes from' Mordremoth?
---
It's still not a guarantee, and Wynne isn't necessarily a reliable narrator, but I'm not sure what else that line could be implying other than that Mordremoth either sired the Pale Tree or produced her seed himself. It doesn't suggest to me that she was created by another being and adopted or corrupted by Mordremoth, but I would be interested in hearing other perspectives.
---
Personally, I feel that if it turned out that they were going to retcon sylvari's implied origins on the basis of semantic technicality, it would feel like poor writing.
---
'Oh, they're not actually dragon scions after all, they're (avatars of Melandru/similar to jacaranda/advanced choya/reincarnated Maguuma druids/elementals of nature) and the Pale Tree/her own mother was *corrupted* by Mordremoth.'
---
From a narrative perspective, it'd be the cheapest possible way to reveal it as a red herring. And if we were going to find out that the sylvari *aren't* actually grandchildren of Mordremoth, the time to do that was at the end of the Mordremoth campaign, before we left Malyck's plot arc and all the other outstanding mysteries of the sylvari race to die in a muddy Maguuma ditch.
---
What's your time doing thst? I got 28s but I could improve by like 6 or 7 seconds (still had time on the rewinder when i arrived at the adventure)
---
Can't believe how much of an asshole answer this is. Especially the last part. If you didn't agree, just don't answer instead of this.
---
Playing fractals almost daily here, some bosses happen to be invisible for some people in the group at times, we never have a weaver in the group though.
---
How do you get back into the room after the story is done?
---
Maybe a broken down respawn shrine
---
It might have something to do with how TP box works. Maybe it's hardcoded that for player to be able to grab stuff from delivery box they have to be within X units of a TP NPC. And maybe all the TP NPCs are coded to show on map. Though the permanent contract NPC permission (only creator can use) might just have to do with economics in order to sell more TP consumables so peeps with permanent one can't just pop one for all to use. It might have been a decent "sales influencer" back when game started, but can't really tell if it still is so. 
---
TL;DR past economics and prolly hardwired coding.
---
No I'm saying different engines require different resources, and the gw2 engine, like most mmo engines, is very cpu intensive.
---
I feel sorry for any dev who has to attend these dev celebrations on release day instead of being able to play the new episode themselves.
---
And its a shame they still call those "Ask Me Anything"....
---
Its simple they shut their mouths but they want to be the first to get that karma and i wouldnt care if they got a banned.
---
&gt;And its a shame they still call those "Ask Me Anything"....
---
Where do they call it "Ask Me Anything"? 
---
Yeah I just bought that as a goof.
---
He would need serious surgery after the hole we left.
---
Same here, got stuck 3 times
---
Condi build is quite easy and it's not particularly strong in fractals due to high ramp up time on its damage. It's good for raids/open world when you just wanr to turn your brain off or focus on fight rather than on positioning/rotation. 
---
Well, I think Jalis is still alive, fighting destroyers in the earth's core? maybe he thought "Small break guys, let's slap a djinn for a change" and they went for it.
---
I hope so. If we get time travel I will talk shit about the anet writing staff almost daily here.
---
The stupid thing is that you can't use your tp contract and merchant contract at the same time because only 1 npc is allowed to spawn for you
---
They thought they could only do more harm to the world. Any way they could help would backfire in the run and Balthazar kind of proved them on this point.
---
What you are describing is investing. Only invest once you have a decenf amount of capital to invest with. It's a slow process and it usually takes a few months to pay off. You can start doing that around 5k/10k gold depending on how brave you are.
---
Example: I invested in sigils of concentration. I think every mesmer needs it for raidinf and fractals and stuff. I bought a bunch and put them in my bank. I am now going to wait at least 2 months before I start looking at the price again since I know panic sellers will dump and bring the price down.  
---
  
---
What you should be focussing now on is flipping. That way you can build up capital and gain knowledge about how the market moves. There are more methods to make money of the tp than investing and flipping but you'll have to discover those yourself.
---
WvW World Restructuring.
---
Thou could make it possible to sell it for gems, back to BLTP somehow. Ofc not the same price as it is in the BLTP, for example sell it back for 1/4th of the market price.
---
I got lots of revive orbs, and repairing kits I will probably never use.
---
Because you replied to a person who suggested that nerfing a bunch of elites to vetarans would make Arah slightly more bearable. And he has a point because they aren't hard to deal with (since they are scripted to do the same thing always and you can get used to it) but they are nothing more than damage sponges which aren't worth your time wasted there. People stopped bothering with dungeons because they nerfed the rewards from the vanilla ones and arenanet never really added new ones in the expansions for reasons unknown to us.
---
I used to sell CM runs for gold, so yeah I can say that I was slightly better than a big part of the people playing.
---
Making it impossible for the 1% to share gg anet
---
It also saves a lot of inventory space.
---
I'm not as bothered by the map icon as I am with the fact you can 'interact' with it. The npc turns to face you and does nothing else, keeping you from interacting with other stuff around it and you KNOW people do that shit on purpose. There's no reason that I can see that it can't just work like portable bank access and make a window just for the user.
---
Well i think i have, and it looks like i've forgotten one story mission from POF and missed/forgotten some dialouge from 4 months ago, seems pretty easy to do.l
---
Answered below: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/acu0ca/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_january_05_2019/eduasf4/ 
---
Basically, Caladbolg is free from a quest at the end of HoT. PoF specialisation weapons are fairly quick, free (but you will need to get the jackal mount, which costs 20g) and mostly soloable. HoT weapons involve doing meta events and a bit of mastery grinding but are easy if you do those maps and metas a lot. 
---
Praise Khorren! Khorren the beloved! Khorren the ever living!
---
long run **oof**
---
GW2 has guilds now?!
---
Well, where else do you think their ears are. Or they just reused animations. Who knows.
---
Then again, bank has at least a few different npcs, no added functionality when being near the npc vs not, and also different access locations (guild bank, crafting places) that could have been decided on before those convenience items, therefore making an invisible npc kind of thing (relatively) easily implementable. But all that is just pure speculation. Though would be nice indeed to get rid of those private NPCs or at least make them public, though the latter **might** have financial impact. 
---
Why /s? This is literally the case, they themselves said as much in an AMA.
---
Anet has finally learnt to write tragedy.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65267/living-world-season-5-all-or-nothing-devs-here-ask-us-anything#latest
---
Those are not skritt eyes.
---
The closest eyes I've seen are those of a mini rock, but one would be larger than the other.
---
The shape of the small black dots look like the eyes of a quaggan calf, but orca quaggan have marks over the eyes, not around them. And the marks would be a round texture, not a part of the model with angles.
---
Its advertisement to get a contract too
---
Might be something for one of the dragonsblood weapon collections? 
---
Tbh, if people dont know about the contract, try to talk to the TP NPC spawned by a contracter, they'll just think 'WTF' and walk away. If I was new to the game, I didn't understand, why I cant talk with the NPC although he's an icon on the mini map and I CAN interact with them. I thought its bugged. It simply doesnt make any sense to me. :c
---
Just throw all the NPCs out of the map, leave all the music and ambient sounds, and let me use Thunderhead Peaks as my guild hall.
---
No no no that wouldnt work ! wheres the immersion ! you dont have anyone to talk to ! thats just not possible for gameplay! /s
---
lets just forget the TP dude spawns out of nowhere without any effect
---
I can't stand hitting M and seeing an empty map, which is why its been so hard to stop playing my thief.
---
I'll probably just throw on netflix and go.
---
The time i found it was right after we had done the Thunder Head Keep event. Before the storm comes.
---
Thank you so much! More than half of the info here is the stuff I was completely lost on!
---
Super excited to descend into the depths of Tyria and meet him in person, if we ever do. 
---
I don't agree when you say that "Metabattle is no help with that". There is a great range of open world build shared on their website and they gave me great advice on how to play my elementalist in open world.
---
how long does support take to answer, ive been locked out of my account because i have a new internet provider and my sms authentication is on my old phone number that i dont have access to
---
You can get into the bubble with teleports though. Even after you got killed. 
---
Praise the Six!
---
On second activation both skills will pull the enemies hit by the first activation towards you. This doesn't realy stop them from using skills, but instead can interrupt their current casts. Additional it can bring the enemies into your GS burst range, which makes it easier for you to kill them fast.
---
As an addition to the CC section: Signet of bane is a strong knock down and will actually prevent an enemy from doing anything for the time of the effect.
---
I might end up buying both since I checked if I buy HoT on a later date it will cost me 30‚Ç¨ so yeah. Thanks!
---
Awww...! I'm sorry! I do love seeing the posts on this subreddit of people who went from that to a better gaming rig and didn't know how amazing the graphics are for GW2.
---
Really? Source on this?
---
only if the people you know are trolls. this is very easy to avoid, since YOU KNOW THEM
---
I'd like to trade those for black lion statuettes, i mean, come on, giving away revive orbs that i don't care about, to get a cool visual upgrade i'd probably use? IT WOULD BE AWESOME.
---
This started happening to me yesterday. I have now downloaded the guild wars executable 4 times.  It downloads and I can even run the game and play... But when I exit, the GW executable file name is there but shows 0gb saved to disk.  So it's gone again.  My system did NOT do a major windows update but it did do some smaller "minor security updates" which I rolled back....  Problem remains.
---
I think he also dies after a while?
---
i second this.
---
giving away 100 revive orb, 10 hair kits[seriously, i don't have any hair to restyle, and i have 27 characters, why the drop rate is so high in blchests?] and 100 teleport to friends to get a set of infinite gathering tools? PERFECT.
---
yeah, I expected to find a npc comment on in, its very wierd.
---
There are two orange/yellow runes. Make sure you didn't get the other one. They have different patterns.
---
Aaahh, the day Nikes video gets outclassed by metabattle. Nice.
---
So I reached lvl 80 on warrior as f2p account and want to get a versatile set of gear which I can use for dungeons, fractals and WvW . I can't buy an expansion right now so which prefix gear should I get and any suggestions on how to get them . Also need help with superior runes and how to get them I have 53 gold saved up.
---
ikr, why the drop rate is so damn high?
---
back in the days i had to buy them, now i get almost one a week with the weekly lv10 key
---
Also I am not a hardcore player and exact optimal gear is not necessary for me
---
I am all for them re-visiting Gandara and making a proper meta, but considering we get a new map every 3+ months, they probably aren't invested in making major adjustments to previous ones anytime soon. 
---
Which in the case of the Moon Fortress really is a bit of a shame. 
---
I have all of the contracts, and I agree with the criticisms. It would be really appreciated if the merchant and trading post guy could be updated to match the newer vendors (tarrktun, etc), as well as how the bank and forge conduits work (they just open windows, no NPC). Being usable on the move is very useful with how a lot of the newer farms and metas work now, being usable together would be very helpful as well, and not popping up to annoy other players would be great. I feel bad anytime people try to use my trading post and merchant; I get why they are personal, but if that's the case, just a window would be better. &lt;3
---
I can't see my guilds historial/log ever since last patches.
---
Tbh the easiest way to avoid spoilers is to avoid coming here or to the forums at all, before you've finished the story yourself. If you're adamant about not wanting to get spoiled, then what in here could be so important that can't wait until the episode is finished?
---
It doesn't matter how well the moderators enforce the no-spoilers rule, because there will ALWAYS be *that guy*, or several thatguys, who will try to ruin the fun for others. Intentionally or unintentionally. And we should know better than to risk it by coming here at all before it's safe. If we do come here and get spoiled, there's no one else to blame.
---
If you get the timing right, you can drop a reflect on a karka just as it begins to snipe. If you're high enough level, they'll take out most of their own health.
---
Surely ArenaNet wouldn't abandon a game that's doing perfectly fine just to create something entirely else that's only related by name?
---
Oh...
---
For F sake. That‚Äôs the best thing you could have ever ask. 
---
Thats a FoS referance. ‚ÄúBoooooOOoooombaaa!‚Äù
---
&gt;A way to support the game if there isn‚Äôt something I want at the time but still feel like supporting them.
---
In that case, just buying gems should do the trick. Let's be real, there's always some use for gems, be it character/bag/bank slots, makeover kits, dye packs or even just the good old gem2gold conversion. 
---
...or you can accumulate gems while waiting for something you like to appear on the gem store.
---
We almost never get tips, and most of us never ask, because we help just to help. It's a nice surprise when it happens, though.
---
Amazing instabilities design.
---
Shittery slope,then bumping and falling of the platforms with new Social Awkwardness. 
---
I would rather take 200% more damage than this bullpoop. Welcome to "GW2 for Kids".
---
But that improvement doesn't really affect the one who has the contract which is why I didn't include the potentially more key sales with the first option as it's a QoL change for the ones who don't have it. Unless there are some other shortcomings I'm not aware of?
---
Sadly, they are into adding content fast. Not exactly good.
---
https://twitter.com/Gaohmee/status/1083109464650145792?s=19
---
Crazy thought.. how about "take all" button = true everywhere! 
---
Honestly if I were you, I'd use a second screen to marathon some youtube playlists or something on netflix while grinding out the map completion instead of boosting. Or use "Ontopreplica" to force a window above the chat and watch something that way. Orrrr listen to a podcast. (I'm currently doing 100% world for the 4th time)
---
i got stuck in the dragon's eye.. multiple times haha
---
If it matters, buy Path of Fire first.
---
It's more fun to play and you can use your mounts to make the jungle less of a chore in some places ;)
---
Kind of funny, though: "I hate killing all my loved ones. But pass me some more ammo."
---
Underrated comment.
---
There are various NPCs that are in male/male relationships, including a few in the current story, but no main characters yet.
---
You analogy is good, although water dropped into water can still create ripples
---
I think gw2 would be in a better spot if there more skills like this.. 
---
Shes pro lootbox sooo....
---
Buh bye, dont let the door hit you too hard as it slams shut :3
---
Wht not create a new character on the same account ? You keep your AP, gold and everything
---
Because dragging out fights against Elder Dragons is a poor idea storywise, not to mention the fact that PoF and this entire season have been connected to Kralkatorrik. Sure they could mingle in the connection to next x-pac while we finish him, but a stronger narrative would be to transition from one conflict to the next rather than have one start to muddy the water of the other. Imagine how much more cluttered and unfocused Season 3 would have been if we ALSO had to finish Mordremoth off.
---
Tbh the only reason for me to get this build is that i don't want to change gear all the time and I'd rather play suboptimal build and just not care  got boon? Great, so shut up
---
Nah, in that pair, it's the Asura. (He also offers to tie the corsair's neck in a knot.)
---
You are definitely not alone.  In the final story, I got stuck in walls twice, and then at one point I somehow fell beneath the map, and got stuck in a cavernous-like box.  As others here have said, you can use the /stuck command and get teleported to the beginning of the instance, and then use your griffon to get back.  I think what I did was: fly back using griffon, and then if you die near where you're supposed to be, you'll respawn at the correct location.
---
I remember when we all hated on "Flame of War".
---
 Which sites do you use to examine prices?
---
This bugs me so much. You pay so much money for these QoL features and then you can't use them fully.
---
Well in terms of finding a guild, are you NA or EU?
---
Just ignore him lol, he doesn't realize ironically acting like an idiot still makes you an idiot
---
What you're not aware of is this troll posted the same comment t on my youtube and I told him I wasn't interested in his trolling disguised as constructive criticism.  Apparently not taking no for an answer he posted it again here to make sure as many people as possible saw it.
---
Eek..
---
I've spent some time to stitch together the complete map of Thunderhead Peaks showing all underground sections in a single image. Including: 
---
- Dwarven Catacombs
---
- The Forge
---
- The Grotto
---
- The Auditorium
---
Even derpier to spot one in the middle of a Fractal CM boss fight. Some human dude just standing there unperturbed in the middle of Ensolyss' assault.
---
Isn't it possible that the Pale Tree is already filled up with enough magic, since both Zhaitan and Mordremoth died not too far away from the groove? What happens when a Dragon Champion step up and consume a big part of their masters power? Wouldn't they fall asleep when beeing 'full', just like the Dragons themselves? 
---
I expected Aurene to hibernate sooner or later after getting rid of Kralkarorrik, not only because I can't think of such a small dragon consuming all the magic of an Elder Dragon, but also because I can't think of the story going anywhere with an adolescend Elder Dragon at the commander's side.
---
Nice work! The final instance is much bigger on the map than I thought.
---
YES ! It looks so much better/more fluid like this
---
As someone else already stated, the commander likely suffered a concussion. Remember the falling rocks? After that it's impressive the commander is still alive.
---
I'm more upset that you're using water spirit in 5 man content where it's literally redundant
---

Wonder if they'll do it akin to the racial city themed backpieces? With a birthday gift unlock.
---
Also love him accidentally describing himself just then.
---
I havent had the oppertunity to play yet, but if that happened before this patch, i dont remmember
---
Honestly instabilities are either annoying for normal group, or just impassable wall of death for less exp group. Sitting in observatory and waiting for at least 2+ ppl that know how to play is the best gameplay that GW2 can offer.
---
Over this year I quit doing 99 CM, and now with that crap fractals altogether.
---
Wow, I never knew this item existed. So this is basically an item for non-mesmers to safe-portal during JPs?
---
One day I'll get there and will be able to enjoy the wonderful graphics of this game in all their glory :)
---
Based on the dark spot in the auditorium (karlks head), is he bigger than primordis now?
---
Oh yeah, forgot it had that :).. That's a good reason for the other contract!
---
What does using Jar Of Luminesce Polish do? I know it's for precursor crafting but double-clicking it seems to do something too
---
I've found that some of them are branded crystals, but not all of them. It's also weird to see that some of the palm trees are pretty small compared to some others that are really big, what could be the cause in size difference between these mesh bugs. 
---
Which didn't stop them from doing them here for half a decade. Don't spout your tinfoil hat nonsense.
---
People will never grow up. Especially not on the internet.
---
I like to do this when I see random wildlife fighting. There. You both die. Fight resolved.
---
Got Dced during the last instance and I'm ported to a Checkpoint. After the third crystal nothing happens anymore and I'm Just softlocked in the instance. Restarting it won't fix anything, can't complete the LS now
---
wasnt there one right after christmas? 
---
Indeed, which means that they will probably never come back and doe the celebrations here. 
---
There was a sale on them just a few weeks ago.
---
They need to stop pushing the stone age engine to it's limit and start working a new/updated one. 
---
Are you trying to say these instabilities are HARD?
---
It has nothing to do with the complexity. It is simply annoying and stupid.
---
Using arcdps?
---
from experience:
---
reset the instance completely, checkpoints and all. you can do this by starting another episode before re-entering the instance
---
Or maybe they will. They did it here for five years despite the internet being a cesspool. But I can see why they'd want a bit more control over it.
---
Character slots were just on sale at the end of December. Given how infrequently that happens, you're probably looking at a another 6+ months until (if) it happens again.
---
Best tank
---
we got 3 version of fishing already in game:
---
2012 -there is heart at branded lake at Iron Marches -there you use speargun to fire at water and pull branded fish to ground and beat it 
---
2018 - Sandswept isles -there are event with actual fishing rod to catch and put fish into basket
---
and of course 2019 - as you mention we got "fishing" in new map dredge zone
---
But as someone else mention - this is not fishing people want. Basicly, no matter how noble they sound with new activity, recepies for new fish food and whatever, they want nice afk farming. Lets not lie to ourself - its same in real world with recreational fishing.
---
Oof, this is *nice*. Please don't forget about this QoL change and revert to some other past method in future, anet. This is perfect.
---
I guarantee you could have sent the mods a mail or the poster a message asking them to remove the post.
---
Raiding isn't the only possible way that those items came to be in the hoard. We know that the dwarves were very good at manipulating metal since we still use Deldrimor Steel for some of our highest level crafting over 200 years after the dwarves stopped making the stuff. It's quite possible that the dwarves sold some of their steel or even weapons and armor made by their smiths to buy the elonan wine and other "exotic" contents of their vaults.
---
My main issue is that once I'm done with the fractal, in the next fractals I'm still unconsciously adjusting for the sliding, out of habit because I've been doing it for the entire fractal. 
---
Same issue with old SA...
---
I think Primordus doesn't corrupt beings, he just molds new minions out of lava, rock etc. Tyria is ever changing so my correction could be incorrect already though. :D
---
That my friend, is a troll I personally have fallen for hundreds of times and was is especially bad when I was new and didn‚Äôt understand. Anet has been coming out with QoL updates recently so maybe that‚Äôll be one, but I think I‚Äôd be a little sad if it was removed to be honest :) 
---
You only bring water spirit for the 10 man regeneration. Warhorn 5 (and healing spring) already provides the 5 man regeneration. The ~900 heal from water spirit itself every 10 seconds is useless.
---
Thief. Thief is life. Thief is love.
---
It does damages, a lot. It is fast, highly mobile. It is very polyvalent.
---
Weapons I use most of the time :
---
Sword+pistol : huge dps, high mobility, stuns
---
Pistols : brainless middle range high dps
---
Daredevil : Moves like crazy, multi-target techniques and good defence
---
Sniper : pretty much best glass cannon imho, very good dps support in PvE
---
A lot of being invisible, blinding mobs, dodging and really. Doing a lot of dps.
---
Classy leather armours.
---
Could've been, if those had some fancier clothing/looks and another NPC name that indicated it's personal.
---
They are poorly only one time a year on sale. Last time was christmas
---
Yup, no more sitting through the whole chapter to do 1 achievement. Now you can pick a section of the chapter you need to see and get the achievements. 
---
People also keep asking where is X, where is Y, because the cast of Dragon's Watch is a tad to large.
---
- ~Zojja~ Bug boy or Taimi is Asura
---
- ~Caithe~ Canach is Sylvari
---
- ~Rox~ Rytlock is Charr
---
- ~Eir~ Braham is Norn
---
- ~Logan~ /~Marjory / Kasmeer~ Zafirah is human
---
In raids thiefs whole support is basilisk venom. 
---
Next episode will be brought to us by the makers of Kourna \o/
---
Remember: this item is probably used by less than 1 % of the playerbase. If i was Anet i would fire anyone even thinking about spending time and money on something this irrelevant. 
---
Water spirit is mostly used in scenarios where you need squad-wide regeneration, mostly one-druid (one-healer) compositions in raids as its regen applies to ten people and makes your CA fill up with barely any input on your part.
---
In fractals it is a worse choice because you have only 5 people total to worry about and Call of the Wild is already enough to maintain regeneration. The passive effect of water spirit is also abysmal so taking it is like not having a healing skill at all when you could be using healing spring or glyph of rejuvenation. 
---
Not entirely true. There are still a lot of story instances left that you have to sit through to get achievements.
---
The link's disabled apparently. Is there another link you could pass on to a potential TP flipper? 
---
few time a year not one.
---
How did the entire surface region of thunderhead not get branded by kralkatorrik? Did he only stick his head out of a portal from the mists directly into a mountain? 
---
The Shark doesn‚Äôt effect the boss. It damages everyone in the circle, so you stay near other players to share the damage between the party similar to the green circle mechanic on Arkk CM. 
---
If you‚Äôre caught on your own when the green detonates then you receive full damage. 
---

Gotta keep other hand busy while tagging enemy blobs with a treb.
---
It's a rather minor mini-game. It's not bad; heck for a heart-game it's pretty fun. But when compared to animal crossing or warframe, it's definitely sub-par. This isn't "oh! GW2 now has fishing!" It's "Hey, go in this spot, grab a fish and take it to a barrel so I can feed my family" sort of thing.
---
Now I see how Kralkatorrik perfectly fit there during the final battle, and I think his body occupy whole bottom half part of the map :o
---
In days of yore, and sometimes even in very recent history, there were living story chapters that had enormous amounts of NPC actions and dialog that players had to sit through in order to attempt a replay for achievements. Arguably, the greatest offender of this scenario was [The World Summit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_World_Summit). Check the objectives that players had to slog through before they could attempt achievements during the Shadow of the Dragon fight.
---
Yeah, doesn't give me much hope either.
---
I‚Äôve heard a story before of a player who‚Äôs engineer only used the Med Kit for their weapon and tried to get to level 80 without harming a mob. Totally possible because I believe every heart (quest) has a way to progress it without killing mobs.
---
Unfortunately, they never finished because they accidentally killed a pirate, so they believed they should become one to carry on that mob‚Äôs legacy.
---
I mean... It's a luxury convenience, not something which you need or dramatically improves your gameplay experience. In all these years I've never really found myself thinking "I wish I had a bank right now" aside from when opening like 20k unid gear in SW.
---
Implies..
---
By the time he is joining raids, he will know what to choose. Raids are a very late game content.
---
But you are right, Thiefs are vastly rejected in any type of competitive and challenging experience.
---
Still. From randomly walking through Tyria to donjons, Living World and all, Thief is a solid class.
---
Warrior is, i guess, a solid pick for him : dps, durability, vast supports technics. But I find it boring.
---
I posted this as a bug in the bug report thread for ep 5, hopefully it doesn't get lost among all the story bugs and disconnects.
---
One time as regular sale and 1 single day in march
---
Welcome to the jungle. Stay away from the pocket raptors.
---
If you can keep a high number of boons on yourself, around 10-11, you can still play the old chaos build. You just need different team setups because with the meta comp you cannot maintain 10 boons permanently.
---
The problem with the chaos build is that it relied on high average boon uptime as it gave you a ton of free condition duration. Also, signet was nerfed from 20% condi duration to about 12%. With changes to soi, chronos can no longer generate almost all boons which makes this tricky.
---
There is no benefit of running the non-shatter build. The burst is lower and you don't apply much confusion which is broken on some raid bosses.
---
If you think that the shatter rotation is too complicated you can do a simplified version of the rotation and only shatter f2-&gt;f1. You have less average confusion uptime but it's much simpler to play.
---
Anyway, you can still play the old build but you have to live with the fact that you could be putting out much more dps if you were playing shatter.
---
Except scholar runes are 8g each now so 53 gold is really 5 gold lol
---
Wel Kralk inside the Auditorium was a lot of neck, not just the head.

I see, thanks! Would you have to swap to the trapper trait with healing spring or is that unnecessary as well?
---
i think you can also evade the shark tho. so go away and dodge it.

As a few people already stated, compared to other MMO's, getting the BiS gear isnt thaaaat hard (still gonna be quite a bit when starting from scratch, gonna get easier once you can run endgame content like fractals/raids), however, gearing up one character won't be enough long term (This is mostly from a raid perspective):
---
Once you set up your first char and were able to, lets say, clear a bunch of the raidbosses, you'll see that the minmaxing in gw2 is less about a gear treadmill and more about class versatility - boss 1 is best to be cleared with a bunch of power DHs, while boss 2 ideally needs you to run a condi mirage, boss 3 suddenly works best with another specific power class, and so on. Ofc you can still tackle all bosses with a single class/build, but you'll notice that some builds simply perform subpar on some bosses.
---
Depending on how much you like experimenting/gearing new classes, you'll have quite a journey ahead.
---
As for dungeons/raids: The endgame dungeon in gw2 is called fractals, its basically a bunch of minidungeons that have multiple tiers of difficulty. For raids, we currently have 6 raid instances with approx 3 bosses per instance, 4 of them are coupled with HoT, 2 with PoF with (hopefully) more to come.
---
Either way, for the full experience i'd recommend both expansions, for testing the waters i'd recommend HoT as the raids bundled with PoF are currently harder to get into.
---
As someone who's spent almost three days solid in her guild hall with slippery enabled, [I'm looking forward to this.](https://i.gifer.com/Fvgq.gif)
---
Every build i do has some kind of aoe to put around me, just because of these devils in scales.
---
Long-time WoW player here (since launch), thought I'd share my impressions of a month of playing GW2.
---
- Welcome back, responsive controls and no motherfucking bullshit GCD murdering my combat flow.  Good *lord* it felt good to get that Legion-style "pow-pow-pow-move-pow-pop CD-powpowpow" that was back-shedded in BfA.
---
- The story being its own thing going very clearly from A-B-C, no hunting around where the next part is, is refreshing to me.  Also, *no quest log* is a delight.  In general, the total lack of need for a "party finder" addon is a joy.
---
- The UI is god-mode IMO.  No addons needed, absolutely loads of options to tweak how I want the interface to work.
---
- You said you love endgame, so I obviously can't speak to that as much as I just hit 80 last week, but from what I've seen there are a decent amount of dungeons/raids; not as many as WoW, but from videos I've watched the dungeons/raids are much more mechanic-intensive than WoW's trash-boss-trash-boss layout.  That may or may not be your cup of tea.  [The wiki section about Endgame](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endgame) was helpful to me, highly recommend reading that.  My impressions of min-maxing is that it really blends a combination of endgame gear (that requires grinding content to get, sound familiar?), finding the skill set that works for you (shit-tons of skills available), and your actual ability to execute with those things.  Rotation is important, just like WoW, but being aware of status effects (on you, on the enemy), avoiding bad while standing in good, dodging/evading, working the mechanics of the fight are more pronounced IMO than in WoW.  I think there's plenty to like even for a min-maxer, it's just framed in a different way.  In any case, you won't be paying a subscription fee to find out.
---
- The community is vastly superior.  People are encouraged by the game to help each other, so getting involved is much, much easier than WoW.  In-game player "Mentors" are everywhere to help you with whatever you may need.  Everyone can "rez" and I have yet to die without someone just rezzing me on the spot.
---
- As for playing solo?  Others will have their recommendations, but I play solo and my limited understanding is that your best bets will be Ranger (hello Hunter my old friend), Thief (WoW rogue but without the stealth and with amped up stealing and mobility and damage), Mesmer (no real WoW equivalent), and straight-up Warrior (see: warrior.)  Every class self-heals/mitigates, so you generally don't need a healer in the way you might in WoW.
---
- The Auction house is again, god-mode.  Sell your shit from *anywhere* at any time.  No need to go back to town to sell stuff.
---
Feel free to ask any other questions you may have.   I definitely think it's been worth it for me, you may find the same.
---
Yeap, when you know how gets knocked closer, I got stuck between a rock and a hard place. My partner was also glitched and died, but because I couldn't die she couldn't revive. I ended up logging out and having to do it in my own instance.
---
I main druid, and if you run with *really* bad pugs, believe me, that 900 will make the difference in wiping or carrying your team through
---
Unless it‚Äôs for stability after the 33 phase maybe? 
---
focus on story first and foremost. once you are done with story then you can relax and explore. exploring will get you lost and dead. the story content tends to be more forgiving. 
---
Yikes. Eagle, then! 
---
Who cares about PvP when there are bots running around. Choose ranger, if u master that class you will be OP, you don‚Äôt really have to control or use it you pet if you don‚Äôt want to, but it‚Äôs helpful when soloing. Guardians are great for a defense build. 
---
I main a Mesmer and I can say in PvP can say I can crush a Nerco and Guardian pretty easily. Ranger are most difficult to get down imo. Thief‚Äôs are not great a healing support. 
---
WvW doesn‚Äôt require much skill, so any class is fine to play. You want think about what‚Äôs best at doing raids, fractals, small Zerg groups, soloing metas. 
---
At the end of the day I say Druid, but you gotta find a class that you love. My Mesmer is not the best but I still do every game mode because she‚Äôs fun to play. 
---
I'd love it especially if they made the raptor skin \[this\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mordrem\_Guard\_Mount](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mordrem_Guard_Mount)).
---
Hah. I like it!
---
Expected this to be a WvW rant and was really puzzled by the spoiler tag...
---
another way of minmaxing is constantly switching sigils/runes on your legendary gear 
---
And Siren's Landing! But hey, if it comes with another new mount I'll be happy.
---
Do the 'walls' in that 3-room section of the Catacombs (11:00 door; can't remember the color offhand) spell something out? The placement seems oddly specific...
---
It's more of the map being stuck in the time before Kralk shows up. 
---
&gt; [crash down out of nowhere like WvW supply](https://i.imgur.com/sC917Rh.gif)

I mostly play for story. IMO Gw2 is the best at. 
---
I'll sure Anet would find some obnoxious particle effect for it.
---
To read the update notes, to ask a question, because your game is malfunctioning somehow and you want to see if anyone's having the same issue, etc
---
considering how kralk can brand everything around him just by being there (or even leave brandstorm after moving away, like he did in Kodash) the final instance of this episode makes no sense and all soldiers involved should be branded before doing any damage to kralk
---
another way of minmaxing is constantly switching sigils/runes on your legendary gear based on who you fight, and that takes a long time to get 
---
A mordrem wolf for Jackal and teragriff for Griffon... I mentioned that using the Fern Hound texture as a base for the other skins would be harder simply because these mordrem creatures already exist, you'd technically have 3/5 mounts done, I know it's not a very accurate comparison (look at the branded griffon) but it's something.
---
wrong word. 
---
There were implied to be a couple of reasons for this - first being the collateral damage. The Gods' fight against Abaddon destroyed large parts of the land and this time there were six elder dragons, which combined would probably be harder to take down than Abaddon - all of them in their own habitats which would lead to more collateral damage. Also, once an Elder dragon died, the others absorbed its magic somehow and adopted it into their own magic (Death-touched/Vine-touched Branded in LS3; probably also the way Mordremoth brought corpses of Diarmid and the other bosses to blighted life in HoT). 
---
The gods were also beings made of the same magic the elder dragons want to nom, and we see Kralky becoming super-charged after consuming Balthazaar's magic. Its possible that getting consumed and super charging an elder dragon is not a risk they wanted to take.
---
And also, the elder dragons essentially kept Tyria in balance.  Its possible that the gods lacked a way to properly replace them and didn't want to throw Tyria out of balance.
---

---
It‚Äôs like saying you want a non-Mesmer build. Try the ele build. 
---
Yeah I'd like that, even if they just made the loot once per character instead of once per day.
---
They answered this on yersterday's stream - the Awakened Sylvari were cut from Kourna/Gandara because of some bug with their body glow. And Awakened charr were in episode 4 already.
---
Hopefully! I prefer him filling a role of  (overpowered) sniper deadeye than Zafirah.
---
&gt; Whatever, you know what I meant, and I literally cannot be bothered with reading your insane ramblings on a word definition.
---
Obviously either I don't know what you mean, or I disagree with them. And I'm pretty sure I'm not insane, tyvm, nor pointing out that there are indeed multiple oracle individuals (and devices) in the game and that not a single one of them predict an absolutely true future would be counting as "insane ramblings".
---
&gt; That's checkmate for you. Shiro was the emperor's bodyguard. Of course he'd be at the temple. There was literally no doubt that he'd be at the Harvest Festival.
---
... Go replay Factions dude. Better yet, let me quote for your lazy butt because you obviously don't know shit and hate to be proven wrong:
---
&gt; Emperor Angsiyan: "Has the temple been secured?"
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Temple Guard: "Yes, my emperor."
---
&gt; Temple Guard: "There is no one inside. Your safety is assured."
---
&gt; Emperor Angsiyan: "You will allow my retinue and my bodyguard to pass. They are coming with me."
---
&gt; Temple Guard: "But... but... no one except you is allowed inside the temple."
---
&gt; Temple Guard: "Those were your own orders."
---
&gt; Emperor Angsiyan: "There has been a change of plans. You will let them through."
---
Shiro was not supposed to go **INSIDE** the temple. But Angsiyan denied tradition and had Shiro go in.
---
So as you say, "checkmade for you". It is, indeed, just the Emperor and four priests praying to an altar for a blessing of Dwayna. Because that is what we're explicitly told. The temple is cleared before the emperor arrives.
---
I think I know some people who would buy keys to get the permanent contracts if they were "better", more consistent or w/e. You don't need to make it available while running, imo.
---
But right now, if you move some (but not a lot and no new map) distance you can't it again since you already spawned an NPC (and the limit is 1?). So you can't even use the merchant and TP at the same time.
---
They now have the tech to make NPC's and the like only be visible on the map to certain players. BUT. Back-changing all the existing items players have in their inventory is the harder part, I believe. That seems to have been an issue when they've made similar changes in the past, and I'm thinking that's where the real coding labor lies.
---
#firstworldproblems
---
Ome thing I might add about endgame gear: equipping yourself for endgame is about maximizing your build for playstyle and content. There are loads (around a hundred each) of different attribute combinations, runes, and sigils with which to tinker with your gear to try to get out just a little bit more out of it. 
---
In my experience, if you want to go really hard into theory crafting, the only MMO with a deeper buildcraft system is EVE online.
---
So, when figuring out what your build should look like the questions I ask myself are like this (in a bit of a jumbled order):
---
What content is it?
---
How hard do I want to try?
---
What weapons best suit this content?
---
What utilities best suit this content?
---
What traits best suit this content and the above selections?
---
What runes and sigils unlock hidden potentials in this build so far?
---
What mixture of stats get me where I need to be, whether maxing my crit, keeping my tougngess up, or keeping my boon duration high etc.
---
If this is daunting, you can also look up a build :)
---
"Heart of Thorns" is truly the "git gud" expansion. You quest through Central Tyria, thinking you're a god among men because everything dies when you look at it and then you venture into the jungle.
---
Welcme to the mayhem. You're gonna love it.
---
Hard disagree there, see my post elsewhere in this comment pile
---
Just make a character and start learning the mechanics of the game &amp; profession. Leveling up to 80 is so easy, I've come to think of it as "tutorial mode" for any class. Gearing for raids will take time, and you can worry about which you like most by then. You don't need to worry about gear for PvP AT ALL. The game makes it easy to have a max level for Open World, one for PvP, one for WvW, etc. Once you get into ascended gear, you can swap it between characters that share an armor class. The meta is constantly changing, so having a variety to choose from that you can play solidly will help with "being desirable for X".
---
But focus on learning the game and fall in love with something, THAT will become your main (or you'll just become an alt-oholic, like many other players).
---
Trash items are a staple of RNG monetization. It gives you no value while psychologically tricking you into feeling you got something, which keeps you buying RNG chests in hopes of getting the things you really want. Then because you need that no value item to be worth something, you horde it which eats up inventory space, which itself does have value to Anet because you need to buy more inventory to house your trash.    
---
Its scammy psychology that abuses human impulse control and primitive feelings of survival. If you don't like that, then don't play the casino. House always wins.
---
This is what I did for my alt account.  Multi-boxed the first story mission so they would have mounts and make my life easier to level up.
---
It seems to be intended, but as far as I remember you could use it as material, if it's in your bank.
---
If you do dailies as you go along, you should have sufficient gold to get a reasonably powerful set of exotic berserkers, soldiers, Valkyries, or carrion gear to get your foot in the door to endgame. It probably won't be exactly the best thing for what you want to do but it will be a very good start
---
I got stuck too, but luckily my Mesmer skills got me out. 
---
Not to mention that you can always just jump into water and kill fish for loot, which is esentially a form of fishing.
---
If they haven't improved their quality i sure hope this is episode is just as pointless as siren's landing was, because not being able to see gandara was really dissapointing.
---
You seriously gonna pretend GW2's raids are somehow more advanced than WoW's? that's hilarious
---
this game has its strong points, and i don't have a clue what WoW's been like since the end of Wrath, but i'm pretty sure WoW raiding still includes elements like "be aware of status effects (on you, on enemy)" and "avoiding bad while standing in good" 
---
Remember the Ghost Messenger at the start of The Crystal Blooms story? She says that the good souls of Domain of the Lost wounded him pretty badly, which might explain why everything isn't branded right away.
---
&gt;This infers one of two things: Anet re-used assets, or the Dwarves led by Jalis Ironhammer tracked down Zommoros and raided the mystic forge (or whatever current state that it or its precursor was) and this room houses their spoils of what appears to be a very successful run.
---
It's also possible that Jalis/dwarves just traded with Zommoros. You know, like we do via mystic forge. 
---
That just sounds like you need ascended Minstrel armor for your Warrior. Go nuts! :D
---
Same!

&gt; there's the luxurious pile of gold novelty chair that comes from the most recent raid wing.

---
With 17 accounts and never actually playing the game.
---
&gt; The shattering of the bloodstone,for example.
---
Which happened at the beginning of Season 3, not the end...
---
&gt; The devs debunked the fact that Gods are opposites of Dragons as in good and evil,but their spheres of influence tend to overlap,and that s just something you can t deny.
---
Do... Do you think I was assigning that assanine theory of the gods and dragons being 1 to 1 opposites? That's hilarious. I've been debunking that since day 1.
---
I'm saying dragon magic in general is shown to be countered by the gods' magic time and time again. And this, in fact, is true.
---

* [Foefire magic, which originates from the gods, is immune to branding](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Help_Sentinels_instigate_fights_between_ghosts_and_the_Branded) and [burns through risen far more effectively than anything else.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/A_Grisly_Shipment)
---
And that's just what I remember off the top of my head.
---
I'm not saying the gods and dragons are opposites. I'm saying their magics from a general sense counter each other.
---
&gt; Pretty much everything relates Kralkatorrik to chaos,since he s the most destructive and aggressive of dragons,and especially since he revels in mind controlling anything and everyone.
---
Every Elder Dragon is "the most destructive and aggressive of dragons" depending on their level of activeness. Kralkatorrik is no more so than the rest. And he doesn't revel in mind controlling everyone - that's Mordremoth's spiel. Kralkatorrik was described as wanting to "have" every*thing*.
---
&gt; EDs also vary in power based on what they consume,since they managed to rule over the other EDs s domains after absorbing some of their magic. Nothing says gods did not work likewise.
---
Actually, everything about Nightfall states the gods do work differently. I mean, not only would Nightfall's plot make zero sense if the gods could just take over the others' domains as they die, because why imprison Abaddon and not kill him, but the gods' magic literally goes volatile and threatens to destroy everything in a LARGE space around it if the god dies. Whereas when an Elder Dragon dies, the magic safely seeps out but The All is a bit less balanced.
---
&gt; The gods saying that their conflict would destroy Tyria makes 0 sense since they never even tried anything about it. They just up and left. They also state fighting EDs is bad. They never said replacing them would have consequences.
---
No, it doesn't make zero sense, because it's not about the act of conflicting, but the outcome. Gods win? The All is destabilized and the world dies. Dragons win? God's magic/divinity explodes, wiping out the world.
---
It's literally a predictable lose-lose scenario.
---
&gt; Abaddon s Death really didn t do much since Kormir was there to absorb most of his rampaging magic,so that s off the charts.
---
Right, because Kormir was there, with a blessing from the gods to become a new god. But there'd be nothing to replace the gods should they die in battle to the Elder Dragons. Best case scenario is literally the Elder Dragons somehow managing to absorb a type of magic that seems counter to their own, which means they become even more unstoppable as Kralkatorrik is now, as he only ate magic altered by a former god.
---
&gt; Balthazar was already being opposed by part of the WM under his guise as Lazarus. He was again opposed by us until we find out he was Balthazar in disguise. And we kept opposing him since. Past all that,he still gave us a chance to join him,presumably due to respect for our strenght,since he clearly didn t need us to bitchslap Kralk.
---
He wasn't really being opposed by the Caudeducs followers of the WM, they were too focused on Kryta. The Commander didn't really oppose him while he was disguised either. We just had Marjory watch him, but not try to stop him. That's not opposition. We literally opposed him **ONE TIME** before he began massacering hundreds left and right to fuel an army.
---
And hell, the fact that he would *lie and deceive* people left and right immediately upon his return is kind of red blaring lights that he's not being a good and honorable guy.
---
If Balthazar honestly wanted our assistance, he would have told the Commander the truth about his identity when defending Aurene against destroyers. But **he didn't care.** He saw the Commander for pests from the get go, irrelevant to his "grand crusade".
---
&gt; Balthazar was caged for disagreeing with the Gods s Exodus and their idleness towards the EDs. He literally calls them weak cowards and swears to strike them down as well if they do not help him. The dev can say what he likes,it contraddicts the Living Story itself,so i m taking the LS for it. He also wanted to fight yes,and add the ED power to his own. But the entire reason he was struck down by the other gods was due to him wanting to join the fray.
---
He didn't agree with the Exodus of the Gods. That happened in Year 0, due to Abaddon's actions and the destruction the war between the gods caused. It had nothing to do with Balthazar wanting to fight the Elder Dragons.
---
I mean, calling others weak cowards and swearing to dominate them is not exactly a guy who's out to save the world. He's out for personal gain. Always has been, never denies it. The dev doesn't contradict anything in the story.
---
And no, the entire reason the gods struck him down was because Balthazar swore to fight the other gods after killing the Elder Dragons (which would destroy Tyria). Not because he tried to fight the Elder Dragons, but what he swore to do after that fight. By that point, they were fully justified in imprisoning Balthazar and stripping him of his godhood, because he had gone off the looney bin.
---
But nothing you said shows that Balthazar cared about Tyria. Because he didn't. You will never find a single line that suggests such.
---
&gt; i can bet you 20 bucks no human prayed to Dwayna,Abaddon and Lyssa in their darkest times.
---
I mean, that's literally what the scriptures of Dwayna and Abaddon are. Humans praying to the gods in their darkest times, and the gods answering...
---
So, pay up.
---
&gt; the fact is PoF was rushed and the commander made stupid decisions.
---
I don't disagree. But Balthazar never gave a shit about Tyrians all the same.
---
Very well said
---
YOU WERE NEVER A HELP IN THE FIRST PLACE
---
Better than BFA I'll tell you that much 
---
&gt;is there still one out there?

No. Chaos was already worse on every encounter than Illusions before last patch, and last patch took away ~18% condi duration from the Chaos build. It's dead. If you don't want to shatter play Renegade instead.

What do you mean by "hardcoded" and "hardwired coding"? I always thought of these terms meaning the code was built into the hardware.

Leaded by the story, it seems that the legend only have to be in the mists, no matter if dead or alive. I mean we could invoke Jokos power when he was imprisoned in the mists and we were imprisoned in istan.

However, I would take the fractals too serious if it comes to lore. After all it's just a way to justify all kind of fractals/dungeons. Also we know that nothing can leave the fractal, that originates from a fractal.

Oh really? I had no idea. I‚Äôll fix that rn
---
"I can outrun a centaur!"
---
Not sure if I used those terms correctly, but what I mean is that (maybe, as it's still a guess) they can't add "X can also do this" because the "this" was built with just one "X" and to be able to add extra "X"'s they'd need to first even make it possible to do that, which, depending on just how complex and built-around-just-one-"X" the thing is, can be quite simple or way too time-consuming to even consider the option.

---
&gt; Wouldn't they fall asleep when beeing 'full', just like the Elder Dragons themselves?
---
Gonna tackle this misconception first. Elder Dragons do not fall asleep because they're full. They fell asleep because there was no more magic left to consume and they began to starve. I'm pretty sure Kralkatorrik has surpassed the point he was at when "full" during previous dragonrises, having the lionshare of two Elder Dragons, a bloodstone, and some of the Mists.
---
Hence why Primordus and Jormag went to sleep when drained of magic.
---
And there's no indication that when an Elder Dragon goes to sleep, that their minions do too. In fact, the presence of Destroyers in Desert Highlands outright contradicts this.
---
&gt; Isn't it possible that the Pale Tree is already filled up with enough magic, since both Zhaitan and Mordremoth died not too far away from the groove? What happens when Dragon Champions step up and consume a big part of their masters power?
---
To backtrack to this now: In Season 1, Tequatl got a canonical powerboost. This was later revealed to be because he was replacing Zhaitan as the new Elder Death Dragon. So dragon champions can indeed replace them.
---
But for the Pale Tree: she's been in and out of a coma since The World Summit instance halfway through Season 2. So she might not have gotten the chance to absorb that sweet delicious Mordremoth juice. Especially since Primordus and Kralkatorrik seemed to get the majority of it, just as Mordremoth and Tequatl (and Kralkatorrik?) seemed to get the majority of Zhaitan's magic.
---
I'd imagine the best time for the Pale Tree to get a bunch of Mordremoth magic would be after Knight of the Thorn, mid-Season 3, when she was fully awake again. With Primordus drained and put to sleep, the Pale Tree could potentially take Mordremoth's magic that he didn't get to yet, or even what he did take (keep in mind Balthazar didn't absorb all of the magic passing through the machine, in fact the beams of magic barely got reduced, so some could have spread to the world).
---
And I agree with Aurene. Something would stop her from being a forefront character. Death seems like a good method for that though. ;)
---
I'm kind of sad there aren't time trials.

If you care about story, then HoT comes before PoF
---
If you want to get access to living world season 3 for some really easy to obtain ascended level trinkets, you need HoT first
---
Half of the elite specs are from HoT and are unplayable if you only have PoF.
---
4 of the raid wings currently out are also HoT related
---
How many geodes does that BL Expedition contract give anyways? And yeah, event farming is very tedious and it's only good if it's super organised, think it gets to like 400ish geodes/hour then, but that happens rarely (think some group does them every Wednesday in EU?).
---
Why did kralkatorrik kill glint then?
---
If all permanent contracts were reworked to be just pop-ups (and the technology is here, sandstorm or tahrrkun) I'd be first to buy them.
---
A night fall¬°
---
All given away except Toy Mini Eye 
---
Seems to be intended, although pretty stupid imo.
---
Gw2 Heroic Edition please!
---
The other account would mostly be used for long term storage for investment items and overflow from materials I collected.
---
Why don't you use them? O_o
---
While it is not required, it certainly helps a lot.
---
Toy Mini Eye please!
---
Well you did just attempt to run/jump full speed down the slope as if the instability wasn't a thing.
---
It'd for the Rift Event that happens there. It was the same with Snow in Jahai
---
&gt; preserve at least a tiny amount of immersion
---
I understand your point, but we already have [that](https://i.redd.it/pu7e6d02kby11.jpg), [that](https://i.redd.it/cb21fc02kby11.jpg) and [that](https://i.redd.it/4j2s1661gn121.jpg). Is an Aurene skin really so much worse? :D
---
Something is wrong with your setup.  Reinstall, do some house cleaning in Windows.
---
Well, damn. That seems to be it. I remembered the video, but not that it opened with a crate.
---
Dem leg textures... 
---
Black lion kits wants to join your cause.
---
Hmm, I have some of those bound already, but I think i can figure out a combo that would work for that. Thanks!
---
iirc thunderhead keep was my favourite place to afk in gw1, especially during halloween wintersday festivals, it was a major mission area when doing the glint storylines. so i'm pretty nostalgic about visiting.
---
I'm in :D twinrova.1675
---
I can‚Äôt get enough of those!
---
&gt; I've never really found myself thinking "I wish I had a bank right now"
---
I access bank literally all the time: to get something I forgot (and I forget things a lot), to quickly check mats or use any of the stored items, to move things to another char quickly etc etc.
---
Permanent Bank is a absolutely the most clickable icon in my Inventory and a game changer for me.  
---
&gt; It's a luxury convenience
---
Yes, and that's exactly why it is extremely disappointing. One would expect a certain level of quality for this kinda price.
---
Everytime someone asking for build templates, it will take another year.
---
There is even a button in the launcher that takes you directly to the patch notes. 
---
What if Kralkatorrik's *‚Äúworld without him‚Äù* meant that he saw Tyria in the future when he was actually in the Mists. He foresaw himself leaving this dimension. 
---
My only problem is they share the exact same keybinds as weapon/heal/utility/elite skills.
---
I too take the ‚Äúworld without him" vision as a foretelling of him leaving Tyria for the Mists. Whether it's the portalling he is doing now and he just saw a glimpse of the world when he was entirely in the Mists, or his total removal of Tyria and the followijg effects of his Brand cleaning up, we can't say that for certain. I like the ambiguity.
---
Wish Anet made certain class specifics such as portal to actually work in content they release. Whats the point of having a portal if they lock out its functionality and people have to resort to unconventional non-intended tactics. Had same issue with them when they first patched guardian wall to not work on certain bosses years ago.
---
If the idea is to have certain skills and professions split between game-modes, split them corectly. Not just eh yeah you can try to port but hoho it wont work because fuck you. You are killing gameplay and profession variety this way Anet. 
---
The second trial instance's knockdown aoes are invisible for me. Because Aurene prevents me from actually dying, the instance is beatable, but getting the achieve is utterly impossible when every other second I'm getting knocked down for a whole two seconds.
---
Not to mention there's the theoretical min/max rotations but then there's your own skill level on whether you can execute it, and how you recover from an interruption due to, say, dodging an attack or the boss moving around. Actual min/maxing is very hard.
---
The opposing argument could be used.   
---
Instead of a popup private window, allow others to use the trading post NPC wherever you spawn it. It makes more sense in game, as it has never made sense to me why a merchant wouldn't trade with everyone if his contract brought him to a place. 
---
Damn, would have loved Nightfall for my girl. 
---
Honestly unplayable. 
---
Thanks for the report!
---
Does this error also occur when you try to set them up on a fresh created account?
---
I don't have faith in arenanet to do a proper build template...
---
works perfectly, however the game instance window name plates cut off the names, i have gunho alt 1, gunho alt 2... etc but all that displays are "gunho a..." for all of them
---
One of my alt accounts uses an email with a period in it which makes the displayed version when it obfuscates the email with \*s all wonky. So, if the email is ["first.last@gmail.com](mailto:"first.last@gmail.com)" the email that gets displayed is "fi\*\*\*\*\*@\*\*\*\*.last@gmail". I don't know if this is just a display issue, but the account won't properly launch.
---
Its currently a workaround porgramming wise. The instance window will be resizeable in upcomming versions.
---
Bought a Aoc monitor which has a few shader models available on a push of a button and they look amazing. Dont think its stressing the card nor cpu at all. 
---
In the first page of option the last items when you scroll down is related to mount animation it could be it. 
---
If not it could be something wrong with game files you need to fix or reinstall the game as said.
---
So the Input checking seems a bit of. Gonna add this to the hotfix patch ToDo list!
---
He said he just hit 80 last week and was going on his impressions of the game...

I am so glad I‚Äôm not the only one who remembers how useless kormir was (still is)
---
Well, you talk about fractals only from "CM+T4" guy perspective, skipping entirely another types of people. While CM's are  not hard enough to be called "for elitists", talking about people who are skilled "enough to do t2/t3/t4 fractals" as "shitshow runners" is disrespectful anyway.
---
Is there a way to change the font of LB? It used to look better on the last/old version. Now the names of the accounts are huge and it doesnt look good on the program windows or the game instances window.
---
Also is there a way to launch only the gw2launcher without autologin? 
---
launchbuddy will notifiy you if your current client isnt up to date and then will update it for you. No need to have a secondary launcher outside of LB
---
tryhard.  
---
ps : we went a bit further with additional portal while doing what's shown in video and linking another coin to the chest it's the same trick that you use for thaumanova to link 3 different places together , results in you doing 2 coins in barely 20 seconds from the moment you enter the room. You might want an additionnal gg at this point to finish the third one with the same trick.
---
wow, awesome, ty
---
Currently there isn't a way to change the font of Launchbuddy. Might be a thing to add in upcomming versions.
---
To not use autologin just leave the login credentials empty
---
Yip - full exotic berserker armour from the trading post is 14 gold which is a week of dailies, assuming no other income and there are plentiful karma options for core stats.

Guild Wars 3: Adventures in Space
---
Thank the gods of gaming, she was not just a horrible game developer, but a genuinely horrible person.  She won't be missed, and may she never come back, or set her evil claws in another game again.
---
Yeah, but those people should shut the fuck up about high level gameplay. Instabilities can be fun for these guys and experienced players, like (almost?) all new other instabilities show. I speak of their runs as shitshow because they think their experience is relevant to mine. It isn't. What they want from a run also isn't. 
---
Hey, I liked Siren's Landing a lot... And bitterfrost frontier is one of the best.
---
love it :D
---
Yes, I wish they would go back and add more checkpoints to various instances. I still don't have the Bitterfrost Frontier meta finished because I've lost so much time to that horrible last instance (15 minutes of unskippable scripts before you get to the final fight). I agree it shouldn't be "dev team based" because that's just ridiculous.
---
Yes true, but I kinda understand why they want to limit the portals interactions.   
---
What we're doing here is basically bypassing the main machanic of the treasure maze.. and by limiting the usage of the port, they're forcing us to actually make this part like it's intended. Even though we're not exploiting any bugs, I wouldnt be surprised if they happen to patch this sooner or later tbh, sadly.  
---
I hope they wont bcs it's a cool little trick that u nearly cant use anywhere else so why not let it be a specific thing to this fract idk.  
---
Anyways :p
---
"I don't even remember you. That makes this easy"
---
Yip, and while no addons are needed for just playing open world there are a tonne of useful addons or UI options for WoW while GW2 has none. Want a roleplay addon? No chance. Want an addon to store your favourite dress up combinations? Nope.
---
If you are min-maxing a character, that is gear and other stat enhancements. Min-maxing "skill" is practice is quite different.
---
Glyph is nice for more Grace of the land and can be used as a nice spike heal, when you pop it during Celestial Avatar.
---
What is a solid class for FoTM/Raids? 
---
I'm currently on Core Bannerslave Warrior but I find Warrior mundane and would like to main a different class (get 150 AR, start raiding).  
---
I was thinking of going Chrono but the dT Discord says Chrono keeps getting nerfs and is quite hefty to gear on the money side of things.  
---
Cheers!
---
Completely changes the game. I loved going back and flying around central Tyria when I first got mine. I never imagined being able to fly over the Shiverpeaks or Orr when I first started playing. 
---
the "gear grind" in gw2 is, because it is very alt-friendly, to have one of each profession with ascended gear and different sets of gear (armor/weapons/trinkets/runes and sigils) to play different aspects of the game and fullfill different roles. (buff support/tanking/healing/power dps/condi dps, special roles in wvw for solo roaming and zerg play or to play certain builds in high tier fractals)
---
that will take you a while. some "best in slot" gear takes some degree of grinding. but only when you really want to min/max your chars.
---
you see, that you can specialize your chars pretty extensively when you want. so there is def. some aspect of "gear grind" in gw2.
---
Okay so I can't say much on guardian, but I do main an elementalist (mostly PvE):
---
Wlementalists are one of the squishiest classes in the game, so you take damage really easily. This is NOT a problem for group content, provided you have someone doing support. For solo content, you just really need to learn the class well - know when to dodge, when to attack, what your skills do - instead of just spamming buttons. Then you should be fine. 
---
The upside to end-game elementalist builds is that they provide some of the highest dps in the game if you know what you're doing - you can look at [**snowcrows.com**](https://snowcrows.com) or [metabattle.com](https://metabattle.com) to look at viable builds/numbers. If you specifically want to do high-damage melee, look up some power weaver builds (what I play).
---
For support - I hate to say this, but if you want to be guaranteed groups then your pretty much stuck to chrono/druid jail. You can play support with other builds, but it's generally not anywhere near as desirable. If you just want to do low key PUG's or something like than on an elementalist, you can find tempest builds that are semi-decent, but would be more mid-ranged or ranged weapons than melee.

---
They haven't made any new activities since 2013 I believe.
---
But doesn't your gameplay affect your character min/max? Like if you can't maintain x% of the time at 90% hp, scholar runes are not the optimal choice.
---
Na There was a other post comparing the sizes of all dragons, and Primordus is waaaaay larger than Kralk, Just google it
---
I hope this map doesn't die like most of the other LS4 maps. The metas are fun and I like doing the whole key/plate thing as part of my daily routine.
---
The mounts are awsome.
---
I did not encounter this personally, but i heard that they bug out sometimes and display a different color as they are in reality. So just try every room, you might be able to enter one
---
thought you meant race as in high-speed race, before i realised you were thinking "racial" my response was "yeah go faster stripes everywhere"
---
Petition to make this effect a standard thing in gw2. I want my personal space god damnit.
---
Wait until you get the beetle.
---
It's a fair thought and one I considered.  I lean towards it meaning death because of how the vision terrified him and, as you say, how desperate he was to stop it.  I imagine that Kralk would not be particularly frightened by the idea of being "trapped" or "banished."  This game has shown us multiple times that A) powerful beings have a way of getting out of being "trapped in a realm" and B) basically anywhere you can banish someone to is itself a realm full of stuff to consume.  Being an all-powerful reality-shifting elder dragon, Kralk probably isn't losing much sleep over the idea of being trapped anywhere.
---
What WOULD scare him is his own death.  He's too big and proud for that.  But, it's unclear.  You could still be right.
---
Did anyone else think this was a GW1 screenshot for a second?
---
/u/TheCheatsrichter Does this update have the account import option we talked about from [1.7 Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a0wf3p/gw2_launchbuddy_17_release_hooking_without_pirates/ealbo3i/) ?
---
Druid. Can't go wrong with it. 
---
Much sadder than the actual mainstory. I mean we were told beforehand what'd happen in the main story.
---
Slippery Slope is good, I like it. It shakes things a bit
---
I've been using 1.4 since forever now. It's an amazing app. The only issue I had with it is that sometimes it would launch 4+ copies no problem and sometimes not launch more than 1 or 2 giving me error that there is not enaugh memory, which was not true as in both cases I had over 10 gigs of ram available.

In 1.5.1 it would keep showing me that my game is not up to date even if it was fully patched until I restarted LB.

---
I originally planned to integrate the import function. However as I started i noticed that there actually are 4 different "types" of account data over the last few versions. Writing the import function to make all 4 kinds of data work would really make this "small" feature a big task and take as long as a few features.
---
This version however is the FINAL version of the account data. Any upcoming Lb version will not require you to reenter any information again.
---
Damn, Skull Kid got some fancy clothes after he got rid of Majora's mask

+1 to this idea. It's not a private contract- just a permanent contract.

This was an issue with the HandleManager, the part of code which clases the Mutex.(the stuff that keeps you from multiboxing). 1.8 Introduces some fixes to further reduce this problem, however its not fully fixed yet, as it is a really complicated topic.
---
OR like the Novelties; once to spawn, again to despawn/dismiss
---
I finally got it to work. ESET was a bit fussy but finally recognized it. I also had to turn off the Windows Defender SmartScreen as it was also being a real pain. Now that it works, very nice interface!
---
That's actually correct. A developer confirmed that the legends Revs channel are not 100% sapient. They are sentient and have a limited conscience but they're not completely aware. They're echoes of the beings they represent so they have memories about events in the past or present but aren't going to simply talk to you about how to solve a current crisis. Like we can already tell they may ask about what has happened since they were last alive or ask you about a rumor that echoed in the mists when they were formed. Or just act like assholes.
---
Calm your tits 
---
Hey, so I‚Äôm looking to get a gaming rig but I‚Äôm on a budget. Just wondering what people‚Äôs thoughts are on I5-8400 processors? 
---
It‚Äôs probably the highest I can go price wise and as GW2 is kind of the main game I‚Äôll play hoping it‚Äôll run it well? 
---
Not an overlook.
---
Yes you can
---
Because then he wouldn't make a vain Reddit post about it
---
That does sound like gankdara. 
---
Thanks! I'm glad its working now. Just hit me up on any further problems.
---
&gt;If I recall correctly, this was a response tweet to a troll insulting some female game devs, or the idea of women working in game development. They just wanted to quickly celebrate all the women who have leading roles in their firm. I get that there's a marketing element to that when you do it on social media, but their social media managers are also their employees who also want to express some respect for their coworkers. 
---
No, you're thinking about the response to said tweet, then ArenaNet's own response in turn. 
---
&gt;I think it's pretty clear that her intent to include more "diversity" is not about marketing for the firm, it was just an ideological thing for her. 
---
I didn't say it was, the point was those intentions are representative of a class of individuals throughout the industry with such attitudes. (Fries also demonstrated this attitude to a lesser extent) This ties in to a degree with the marketing aspect, the adoption of such schemes are obviously driven by advocacy from these people, but ultimately from a corporate perspective it's motivation is the usual profit maximisation.
---
&gt;She did once tweet about putting more of her "girl cooties" or something in the (next) episode which would have been episode 4. I remember playing through it and having to question what that was. The closest thing I could think of was Zafirah, but there's nothing remarkably diverse about that character when you put her alongside all the other characters we have already. For all I know it could have been something they just dropped because they no longer had her to work on it, or she was just making shit up for attention.
---
Playing through the episode, I recall there were a number of flavour text or other interactions that manages to oh-so-coincidentally "reveal" relationship status. Ironically, that is what I originally noticed, not the orientation.
---
&gt;However, you can't just look at any example of diversity done in media and make this claim.
---
Sure, but I'm not doing that, I'm looking at the bigger picture. ArenaNet have demonstrated a distinct trend towards these behaviours.
---
&gt;the writers at Arena Net are by no means rich. At best they are middle class, but even then with the cost of living in Seattle-Bellevue area many of them do have to be careful about their spending.
---
The fact they're in the games industry and are capable of living with said costs I'd say rather contradicts this point.
---
&gt;A lot of them are also not white, and on the topic of gay people in this thread, a whole lot of them are LGBT+. I was trying to get at this earlier. . some of this representation can just be the devs or writers putting something they can relate to in the game. 
---
Do we even have any meaningful statistics on this? Because given the aforementioned points I don't think judging by their marketing material is a particularly accurate.
---
most other games with mounts I've played boiled down to 
---
1. change animation to sitting on mount 
---
2. increase speed with 100%
---
so yeah gw2 did a much better job
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

---
There's nothing quite on the scale of dragon's stand, or really anything that matches the idea of "map wide meta" since HoT. The closest you can get is probably on the Domain of Istan (LWS4E1), or if you want a bigger challenge, Serpent's Ire in Vabbi (PoF). On a smaller scale, the newest map Thunderhead Peaks has two main meta events that are pretty cool, especially Thunderhead Keep.
---
Again though, nothing quite on the HoT level of map wide events
---
They somewhat changed it but still do this: ls3 used this with stat selectable trinkets and seraph stats. Pof somewhat did this as well. Season 4 has started to use skinsets to a similar end.
---
About the 6: 3guaranteed + a chance of 2 by metas + a chance of 6by hidden chests in the 3 rooms you go through + 2 non hidden chests in green + 3 or more in the southern wing. For my guildies and me this has lead to 4-8 a day averaging around 6. For more specific drop rates we'll have to wait. 
---
I know. But when you double click it, or right-click and select Use, one gets consumed from your inventory.
---
The contracts are definitely showing their age. Back then it didn't seem like such an annoying issue. But so much quality of life has increased in the game that the fact that I can't move without my back contract window closing is outlandish. I found it hilarious when they decided to change/fix the let line converter to not do that like 2 years ago. But no contract changes :/
---
The Jagged Kournan Beetle mount skin, from Distant Lands. I use it on most of my Sylvari except Engineer. I love the look of that one
---
I will join, I am Shadeflayer.5610 :D
---
Take the chronomancer rage with a pinch of salt. 
---
For reference, chronomancer was *absurd* in how powerful it was, so nerfs mean "no longer at a tier entirely of its own for raids". It used to tank and provide every boon for everyone fairly permanently. It's no longer god-tier and that upset people who had put work into getting their build right and learning what was a fairly complex rotation. It's also in demand a lot so having two instead of one in a party means there's a shortage of capable chronomancers who want to raid, and that has upset some people. 
---
Mesmers are still good in all forms of play. Chronomancer is a solid DPS with support on the side, high self-buffing ability and will always have a place in fractals. In raids it's common practice to have two because they hand out alacrity and quickness like it's nothing and can maintain for a long time. 
---
I run my chronomancer with mostly berserker's stuff and a few diviner's bits, mostly for general PvE because they siphon boons off phantasms if traited for it. A mixture of berserker's and assassin's is the standard, I think. 
---
I also have a druid which is kind of simple to play. Healing as needed. Generate might. Warhorn for fury. Repeat. It's fairly low effort and always appreciated. 
---
dude. Take a step take back and a deep breath. Since you're on the topic of life advice let me share what I've learned. First, being able to take criticism gracefully, whether constructive or not, is important. Think of it as proper PR for yourself, if it is mismanaged you will fall out of grace with whatever community your interacting with. Being able to take that criticism and really self-evaluate to judge whether it was good or bad or at least has some merit, will take you much farther. Granted this isn't easy, sometime it hurts to admit that you didn't handle/do something right or it could have been better. Personally I think your video is great. Yeah it could use less umms but I like the one take aspect, made it feel genuine. Be proud of your content, but also be open to constructive criticism. Also the internet will always give unsolicited criticism(e.g this comment), you can always ignore it.
---
That‚Äôs the one. Thank you, I could not remember the name but could picture it perfectly. 
---
yeah they said they can drop expansion level content in living story but i guess not

I was refering to

&gt; absolutely loads of options to tweak how I want the interface to work.

Hi everyone! I'm thinking about returning to the game after 2 years or so (when season 3 finished), I really liked the game but I ended up burned out after playing so much back in the day. I'm reading about the game again and it seems there is A LOT of new things that it's overhelming. I'm reading the returning player guide too, but I wanted to ask a few questions:
---
1. There's now a season 4 of LW and I pretty much missed it, so I need to buy the chapters with gems so I can play it. What place is nowadays reccommended to farm gold?
---
2. Do people still run old maps like those released during season 3 and HoT?
---
3. Any tips or things I should know after so much time without playing?
---
Rollerbeetle, after that probably skimmer and rabbit
---
Something nobody is mentioning (and I'll probably get downvoted for bringing up) is that without a $15/mo subscription, most of Anet's game income is from the gem store (cash shop) and it shows. Players who haven't played a fresh account recently seem to forget just how much QoL is locked behind purchases. Sure you can convert gold to gems, but the kind of gold income to regularly do that is going to require a lot of time/effort plus a fair bit of start-up.
---
The main way to dispose of drops is salvaging -- think disenchanting, but everyone can do it, and by the time you reach max level the main reward from events is large quantities of cheap gear to salvage for materials. Problem is, you need salvage kits to salvage gear, and you can either buy a dozen every time you're in town and play a constant game of Inventory Wars -- or you can buy the two types of infinite-use salvage kits for about $15. With this style of drops, even with infinite kits you might need to buy an extra bag slot or two ($5 each) unless you like salvaging mid-event. Decide to play an alt, too? Looks like you need to invest in some Shared Inventory Slots ($8.75 each) unless you want to move your infinite salvage kits back and forth each time you swap. Constantly salvaging gear results in a large amount of materials, but never fear -- you can deposit them into a free material storage, up to 250 per material. A few common ones are going to start building up fast after you hit level cap, easily passing that 250 if you're regularly doing the right gold farm. You can either buy an extra 250 slots ($10) or store extra stacks in your bags/bank. Your bank is shared between characters, but when the base 30 slots starts to feel like not enough, you can buy more tabs of thirty ($7.50 each).

Most of the story is locked in "Living World Episodes" which you don't get with base expansion purchases. You can buy them either individually ($2.50 each), or get them in bundles of "seasons." Even if you don't care about the story, the current best gold farm in the game is locked behind one of these (S4E1, Istan), and these episodes are also home to the primary ways of getting certain gear stats and foods which you'd need for high-end raiding or fractals (M+ equivalent), depending on your build. 
---
Then there are cosmetics. GW2 has no barbershop, but you can buy a hairstyle kit ($3.12) or total makeover kit ($4.37) that hold most of the better appearances. Each time you want to transmog a piece of gear, it requires transmutation charges. You can get these by playing, but apart from the 3 free charges a month you can either play a bunch of PvP or complete maps (think doing all the quests in a zone) for them. If neither of those suits your fancy, you can always buy them ($1.87 for 5, $7.50 for 25). That's not even getting into the hefty gem store "Style" tab, full of appearances ($10 for a set you can mix-and-match, or $8.75 for a fixed set) and mount skins ($5 for a skin lootbox, $15 for a specific appearance from the lootbox, $20 for a set of themed matching skins, $25 for a high-quality individual skin). All optional, of course, but I recall the artificial scarcity people were just recently criticizing Blizzard for is the bread and butter of ArenaNet.
---
The only thing they're doing better than Blizzard on the cash shop front is that they don't sell absurdly-priced instant level boosts, and server transfers only matter if you play WvW (large-scale PvP). 
---
I'm not going to get into combat or content or anything like that -- others in this thread have made some excellent write-ups about those -- but I feel like you should know what you're getting into when it comes to microtransactions.
---
Once you hit level 80 there are three tiers of gear to really think about; exotic, ascended, and legendary.
---
Exotic is very easy to get, you can buy the gear straight off the trading post. They are fairly cheap
---
Ascended is a bit harder to get as you can't buy them off the TP. This page has the different ways you can get ascended gear. [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended\_armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_armor) Ascended gear is not a whole lot better than exotic.
---
Legendary gear has the same stats as ascended gear, but you can change the stats at any time while out of combat.
---
There are dungeons and raids that exist in the world. There are also fractal dungeons which don't exist in the world, these have scaling difficulty if you want to see how good you are. However, unlike WOW you're not going to be gearing up via these things. You can get unique looking gear from them, and stuff to sell on the trading post. There is no LFG/LFR system except via something akin to an automatic message board, but an LFG/LFR system isn't needed since the very difficult content is not required for advancement.
---
So, what is there to do at level 80? There are a lot of world events that require a boat load of people to complete, and there are end game events require groups to coordinate if they want to complete them. There are guild missions that can spawn in world bosses. You can do achievements (the achievement system has a lot to do). You can hoard gold. You can craft things and sell them on the TP. You can just gather materials and sell them on the TP.
---
If you can, I would get both expansions just so you can access everything. Heart Of Thorns adds a mastery system, a new class, gliders, elite class specializations, and a new jungle area. Path of Fire adds mounts and a desert area.
---
 For anyone struggling to read the abomination that was my hand-writing and grammar, here you go. I've tried to keep it as accurate as possible, I even left the mistakes for you.

‚ÄúMy name is \*blanked out\* and I‚Äôm going to buy the Guild Wars 2 collector‚Äôs edition as soon as I can because even though I‚Äôm still relatively new to the MMO community (15 months) and I never played the original game, I still feel ecstatic about it. The races look really good and the professions extremely polished. The mechanics where you switch spells &amp; abilities when you change weapon type amazes. I‚Äôm confident it will bring a new depth to the game, create interesting gameplay and I hope it will scare off the kind of player that think they should be given epics and achievement on a silver platter because I honestly detest that attitude. Why should a game be dumbed down just to fit your convenience or epics become easier to acquire. You complain how the more devoted players, or ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù as you always dub them (which is fairly innacurate) have better gear and whatnot so you think you deserve the same just because you pay to play. Well guess what, the people with true skill and evotion deserve their rewards because they earned them, through skill and dedication. I really should get back to college now, don‚Äôt wanna be late!

\*blanked out name\*

‚ÄúRecently I have found that writing down my thoughts, although slow and often hurts my wrist, has been almost refreshing. It‚Äôs wednesday today and less than 50 hous to go before the first BWE for the upcoming revolutionary MMO, Guild Wars 2.
---
I never played the first game back in the day and I have only properly known about this game for 3 months but I am extremely hyped about it. I can‚Äôt wait to create my Asuran Mesmer at launch so for now I will just be a charr. I have learnt the language that will be in-game, New Krytan, for some extra immersion. Currently 3 letters are missing but I am confident I will discover them this weekend. At the moment my handwriting is rather messy. The Beta Weekend Event will last 60 hours and unfortunately I will not be able to partake for so long because even though I will literally not sleep at all, I will still have to have dinner and so something constructive/useful to the household because it‚Äôs pointless trying to explain this once a month opportunity to play this incredible MMO to my dad. Staying up all night, friday, saturday, and sunday will not be easy, especially without energy bars or drinks, but I am up for the challenge and I can‚Äôt wait to play.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúMany people say that Guild Wars 2 will kill WoW. I doubt it will. Even though GW2 offers no sub fee, a linear leveling curve, incredible graphics, incredible combat and crafting mechanics and more, WoW still has 10 million subscribers and still spits out new and appealing content. My belief is that it will hinder their subscription base harshly and it will revolutionise the industry. Guild Wars 2 does so many new things that it‚Äôs audience clearly love; other MMO developers would be retarded not to take a few leaves out of Arena-net‚Äôs book.
---
I pre-purchased the Collector‚Äôs Edition and I am so glad I did. Non gamers may think that ¬£129.99 is too much but an items worth is what you think it‚Äôs worth and how much you are willing to pay for it. I can‚Äôt wait for my 25cm tall figurine of the charr Rytlock Brimstone, my five custom art prints, my own CD of Guild Wars 2 soundtrack and my book detailing the development of the game. This game will literally offer my hundreds of hours of entertainment as I will be leveling my Mesmer, doing hundreds of dynamic events, I‚Äôll be looking for every secret and puzzle and running all 32 dungeons. And after that I will level an engineer and after that a thief. This game will envelop my life and will enjoy playing more than any other game in the world‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThirty-five minutes left before I must go back to class and after that just another 3 hours before I can go home. Once there I shall continue downloading the beta client and I will read more posts of the Facebook page.
---
Lunch at college is boring and it just fills me with even more eagerness to go home. Writing is blank, nothing, something and full. Writing something special isn‚Äôt easy, nor is it hard. Any book about life is filled with answers but also blank pages. They tell you nothing today but something next week. T
---
Twenty minutes before I must leave for class, this is getting tedious. No one ever wrote that we‚Äôre not special because we are special; that perfection is impossible because perfection itself is a flaw; but I am now and no one will ever read this because are my thoughts and so they shall stay.
---
Tom will no doubt ask where I was last week and I will answer with: ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt really feel like coming in‚Äù.‚Äù
---
 I just re-read your post. I just have my mount ability 1 and 2 on Q and E. The utility skills are just the same as my normal skills.
---
&gt;Kralk: "So what now, my daughter? Are we to be two immortals locked in an epic battle until Judgment Day and trumpets sound?"
---
&gt;Aurene: "Or you could surrender. "
---
like this? :D
---
Can you quit the ep, start a different one, then come back? That might reset your progress on the story step.
---
Please don't waste your time typing if you aren't going to be helpful. I'm not a vegetable and I know how sliders work. I clearly said CERTAIN lines don't play.
---
With that same logic I could equally say they could just remove all of the mobs in fractals and have just as valid of a point as he does, because they are not hard to deal with either they just serve as damage sponges that aren't worth my time.
---
it reminds me so much of the good ol' TF2 days pushing anchored team mate engineers off cliffs i love it
---
thank you
---
Completely get you but its in core not a desired mechanic. In reality CS allows you to move a few meters before you get placed back in time and not teleported (intentional focus on time rather than space). So more of an "accidental" or side product of class mechanic.
---
Classes being locked out of certain gameplay possibilities is completely fine (stealth, wall, jumps, portals,...), makes you think on how to work around your obstacle, select team, etc. Classes having means to beat certain obstacles but being locked out of using them by design is in my opinion a bit off the point. Refering back to stealth. Introduce a class that evolves around stealth, then put perma reveal to everything makes the class loose its charm and if there is nothing else specific or usefull about it, welcome cemetery. 
---
Is this possible if you're not part of the guild, or is this a guild-only thing?
---
I am also really happy it doesn't kill you any more. 
---
1. Sadly, the best place is season 4 episode 1s map. Silverwastes is still viable. Octovine still gives a good chunk of gold. But your best bet is fractals. If you do your 6 daily fractals and save literally all the money, you can get an episode every 4 days or so.    
---
2. Absolutely, with the possible exception of Verdant Brink. Season 3 introduced a legendary trinket that requires you to do stuff in all 6 maps, so they're very alive. PoF and Season 4 didn't introduce too many large meta events, so AB/TD/DS still draws crowds.    
---
3. Not really. Unlike HoT, PoF and Season 4 didn't add too many new systems. Just a lot more content in those existing systems.
---
Well everyone is faster then Aurene now.
---
[this one?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DxS7eT_ky4)
---
Ya,  so those will be the same as your default skills. I have my mount ability skills (griffon dive / rise ) set to the same buttons as utility 2/3. With the new mastery skill I now cant use it without changing my keys. Does that explain it better?
---
I really don't understand why the underground portions don't appear on the map in game, even on the bottom layer.
---
It's not that much harder. However, people are complaining because they paid for the convenience of not having to do that. Going to the kitchen to grab a drink is easy, but it's easier to grab one from the mini-fridge beside your desk. It's worth it for some people.
---
The spice must flow!
---
That was really great!
---
I think this will be more helpful as a response to the OP, as I said I'm fresh and have no idea.  Great writeup for me as well though!  Thanks!
---
Gotcha. Thank you!
---
Have the same issue, but it loads just fine for me
---
This is 90% of the reason I love the contract. The Black lion trading company has really good service. They‚Äôll come all the way to interdimensional space to bring you your goods
---
"I'm rich you know"
---
Gives life force to nearby necromancers, too.
---
&gt; So what? The fortuneteller didn't predict that. Shiro didn't have to enter the temple to be killed at the Harvest Festival.
---
Except that the ceremony happens... inside... the temple...
---
The mini iron farm has some very annoying invisible walls in it.
---
Ah wicked! Might just go and get that then. Btw, what BD% should I aim for?  
---
All of the people over at dT are saying stuff like getting 300 AR or 222 AR and then using Mist Potions to get 100%BD, but is that really necessary?
---
Ohhh I really love this. 
---
This map has a ton of invisible walls too which feels like extremely lazy map design. 
---
Asuran magic. Everyone knows they are the ferengi of gw2.
---
Yes plz. Give us a Snowy guild hall!
---
yea so basically you took the elixir build but made it worse by adding some elements of the protection build(without the protection cuz that would make too much sense)
---
i mean sure it works and this is one of the reasons i can't be impressed by roaming videos..the people you "fought" had worse AI than the moas in queensdale
---
rifle turret is a terrible idea, elixir s is much better but you already knew that and just wanted to make something different..rocket boots, hell even battering ram would be better than rifle turret
---
oh and sigil of force? really?
---
I've opened all 13 hidden chests and 24 map chests as well as doing 2 metas. So far I've gotten a max of 5 jewels (today, 1 from north meta, 1 from hidden chest, 3 from treasure room), and mostly 4. Average of 6 is not gonna happen.
---
Could not open Crashlog!
---
Value was either too large or too small for a UInt16
---
Does that make him the strongest?
---
When they updated some of the contracts they said it was technically challenging to change the other contracts to work without an NPC
---
I suspect the problem is they use the NPC to decide whether you can pick up items or not, since you can already load the trading post window anywhere
---
&gt;lets just forget the TP dude spawns out of nowhere without any effect  
---
you can even spawn the NPC while gliding.
---
They super nailed it with the feel for each mount. Going for utility over generic speed boost was a break-through..
---
How do you have so many!
---
Waiting on that comparison between his old and new models, u/that_shaman... And perhaps an updated version of [this image](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Elder_Dragons_size_comparison.png) using Kralk's new model.
---
After his battle he may be too weakened to brand stuff. When his head was down, it looked like he fainted, or in game's terms, went into downed state. He was lucky he got a kill and rallied, otherwise Kralk would have been toast.
---
" We have overhauled Mistlock Instabilities and added new ones in order to promote a more positive gameplay experience."
---
If you are F2P: you can't, since F2P are server locked.  
---
If you are Core or the expansion you can transver if you have no characters active or transfer with gems.  
---
If you are F2P who pass into Paid Account, You'll get one free transfer, then similar to the above conditions.

The "underground fortress" is three areas. Only one, the giant hole area, is part of the story, the rest is open world. And we don't go through the entire Auditorium area, just three of the platforms.
---
The name Dreamthot though lol
---
Right, the damn incels and their ridiculous vocabulary are popping up everywhere. The wife let me know they actually had an incel episode of Chicago Med this week. 
---
This... is a good idea. Thank you!
---
Hooray for a non-rectangular map. I mean mechanically it is, but visually not really, once you exclude the underground parts.
---
Community: Mesmers need better senergy in groups.

Anet: so... more clone spam..?

Anet: nerf support chronos?

Get off my Lawn!
---
The metas certaintly lose interest once you do them but I like the current system. I just go do smth else when I'm done with the metas. 
---
HoT metas work the same way. Get the spicy reward once, however if you repeat ain't getting it no more. You do still get loot and you can still make progress on the grindy achievs related to these metas right? So I think its not all bad. 
---
Better than Battle for Azeroth.
---
^^^Which is not saying much.
---
Most of the time i run domination for the cc trait. If it's not needed, dueling for damage or illusions for more shatters.
---
I think I have the most useful permanent contract, the bank one. Stylist is nice bit I have like 50 hair style kits and I'm content with my characters looks since launch :P
---
Dormamu I've come to bargain
---
Thats why i made a tour with all my 9 characters. Now i feel the urge to play through all stories and ls seasons with all of them to get rid of the green stars.
---
Does the snake still pendulum swing all over the place? Is it only on Asura or is it with all races that it does that?
---
I agree with almost everything but at this moment I don't think class variety in Gw2 is an issue(only the buffing classe, i.e chrono , is but I believe it is going to change pretty soon). 
---
You can go dps with anything you want. You can go heal with a variety of classes, most of them are accepted in everyday pugs. The only 2 locked spots in raids is the BS and Chrono buffer. Atm you don't even need a 2nd chrono if you have the right setup. 
---
Mesmer and it's specialisations has build for everything you want and is very versatile with its weapons and traitlines. 
---
This is the best option, HoT maps are still very populate with the meta events.
---
Since its [not in the API](https://github.com/arenanet/api-cdi/issues/628) somebody would have to type them in by hand every week. I can't think of any sites which already do this off the top of my head.
---
It isn't fun when you fall off the bridge when fighting Bowser. Doesn't mean it isn't fun when Mario gets to the axe and Bowser falls. 
---
Thot wasn‚Äôt invented by incels...
---
He sounds like a local hero in one of the old Soviet's novels.
---
Change character name to something from an anime, and dye all armor black - guaranteed nobody will want to come close to you.
---
I vaguely remember seeing eyes like those in something related to Halloween. Maybe as part of the decorations of the old LA, in some dark spots. 
---
The eyes are likely just eyes, not part of any model.
---
Lil' Shish-kabob's bonding was spread over large amount of time, so people got bored of her. Sergei's story was compressed into a short adventure, so it hit you with its full potency all at once.
---
"my impression of GW2 is that unlike WoW, the challenging PvE content requires you to pay attention to buffs, debuffs and environmental hazards"
---
sorry, that's a ridiculous statement and one's experience of GW2 has no bearing on that ridiculousness
---
Well, that's why he has one more bullet.
---
You don't need the buff, only plates. Even if relogging removes the buff, you can still continue.
---
This is why I prefer the perm "merchants" you get from the ecto gambling/sandstorm gambling.  Those open up the vendor window directly, and don't require that you stay still to keep it open.
---
Ok. Now hide this before arena net reads this and fixes it
---
Have you checked the wiki? His wiki page at the bottom of it might be what you are looking for.
---
Will there be any new expansion soon? I've seen a post here with a picture that looks like a new map
---
Yeah he was. Just saw it, right before the last attack he did and aurene protected. Last crystal. B was above kralky. Or at least some image of him. 
---
Still a confusing ending so abruptly. 
---
the grind is there, its just optional, game has endgame, raids and fractals "similair to mythic dungeons in wow" as for fashion wars, gw2 takes the approuch of never increasing the level cap, so all content across expansions and base game that is lv80 always stays relevant and challenging, reason to go to say one raid over another is uniq loot, people want there kool looking shinies :P hence fashion wars
---
you can min max your characters, you can go from exotics to full legendary gear, you can go from base infusions to one with stats to max that damage out, you can go from basic fractal runner to augmenting your account with buffs from grinding your ass off daily for a year plus! , again the grinds there, but its option :P , everyone can play, but if you wanna take it that step further, you can :) 
---
Goddamnit thats genius. Gonna try that tomorrow. No more skill clicking \o/
---
Ah yes, I had missed it haha thanks
---
I would personally disagree, depending on what you mean by min-maxing. If you‚Äôre talking about perusing new vertical numbers, then you‚Äôre correct. Once you get ascended that‚Äôs the numerical higher power level and it‚Äôs gonna stay that way. HOWEVER, if you play WvW you‚Äôre in for a treat.
---
 I spent a few weeks around the release of HoT absolutely min-maxing the fuck out of my condi revenant. I started with (full ascended) celestial gear + dura runes, and slowly tested out different stats on different slots until I settled on Cele, Viper, and Shaman.
---
 I also think min-maxing exists to an extent in PvE. You‚Äôd have to really put some thought into it, and would absolutely require running numbers on it and knowledge of the class. Examples: grieving/viper guardian in PvE, chrono gear sets depending on what level of tankiness you want. 
---
TL;DR: 90% of the time you‚Äôre not gonna need to min-max, unless you really want to make something off meta work or WvW. 
---
I'm not sure why you're confused. It was a cliffhanger. Its a common tool in writing for all sorts of Media. Braham asks "What do we do now?" To which the commander replies "I don't know". I honestly don't get what there even is to be confused about.
---
As for the picture of Balthazar, you'll note there was also a picture of Mordremoth and Zhaitan, and all three merged into an attack. The three major sources of power Kralk has absorbed.
---
I'd rather be close to an all wearing black dude than the atention craving walking pride day parades full of irradiated christmas elves that walk through LA.
---
I was wondering the same thing. I thought it might be part of one of the adventures, but someone would likely know that already. 
---
That is called living world. There is a new ‚Äúepisode,‚Äù map/story, around every 3 months. They are free as long as you have the expansion and you log in during the episode. So you will unlock this episode if you get PoF but none of the previous, those you have to purchase with gems. I believe they go on sale as well.
---
HoT has some very good living world maps for trinket gear for end game. I don‚Äôt expect a new expansion to come out before fall 2019.
---
But Gaheron's are the best :D 
---
I love it when i was push my guildmate out of the orb during 99 cm 
---
I'm still playing [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQRAnf3anELDNoh1LDWoBMMjlVDrsDUcCA+HwG4D0MGsc6JA-jxxHQBDU5nN2fYeq/MO9Dz6JAkRlgA4kAQKgFVWB-e), and it works fine.
---
I'm sure I'll switch to an updated build when I stop being lazy.
---
Yeah hearing her cry made me start too.
