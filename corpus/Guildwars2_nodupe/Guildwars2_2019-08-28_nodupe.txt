Unless I have missed something, this looks like these icons are for all the weapons that aren't already associated with an elite spec.
---

---
This looks to me like it just completes the set, which to me screams they have been designed for the build templates
---
---
---
&gt; Laurelai
---
... It *can't* be. Well, on the other hand, it's from 2015, so maybe it *is* our Laurelai.
---
You should remain at that story step even if you begin a different step.
---
You only have to reactivate that story in your journal when you’re ready to pick it back up again.
---
Maybe they are making them land weapons perhaps? Or maybe it has something bto do with build templates.
---
Ask each "What is your favorite moba?"  Follow that up with "What is the best feature of that game that you wish gw2 had?"  Follow up from there as you see fit.
---
T H I C C !
---
If you are on EU then you are shielded a bit from the effects, NA is in a completely different spot and the off-peak timezones are different again; the effects are much more clear for these timezones.
---
Id be fine with it if it wasnt the only skill in your arsenal that did any reasonable amount of damage. At this point, facing a Deadeye is super-easy because even the glassiest builds cant kill you if you just dodge DJ. If Three-round Burst wasnt hilariously overnerfed, or if Spotters Shot was like PvE (instead of being the only kneel skill to be a *downgrade* compared to its regular version), Deadeye would feel more playable.
---
It could possibly be something to do with build templates instead.
---
Zero.
---
If there isn't a major class addition (elite specs, dual classes, a fourth traitline, anything) that'd be the actual dealbreaker for me.
---
Lol rip, I read the mail but not well enough apparently, I even made 50 of those to level my cooking to 465 and vendored them all. Here I am trying every food in my inventory and bank to see what he wants...
---
Did this account have any security on it apart from a password shared with other places? :)
---
Your account might be compromised.  Change your password and contact support, they might be able to recover your character.
---
to open them all at once with maxed out magic find to get some more ascended gear.
---
Its not like i didn't open any chest at all beside those i opened here in the last 1-2 years.
---
^(*holy shit*)
---
upsides: the game is casual, and is designed around a cooperative community. Quests that happen in the open world, called events, can be done by anyone that is in the area, without giving priority to whoever tagged it first or anything. The combat is a fluid mix of action and tab target, where your own survival is dependent on your own ability to maintain life and avoid damage through dodges and blocks (although it is super easy in the early game, which can be a pro or a con depending on perspective). Unlike in a lot of other MMOs, GW2 doesn't utilize a hard trinity system of dps/tank/healer, and instead, we have more of a soft system. What this means is that every character has the potential to fill different roles, depending on how you want to play at the time. A ranger for example can play as a dps role in one party, and then change gear and skills/traits and play a support/healer role in the next. Gear and level caps haven't been increased since the start (well, gear cap got increased once near the beginning to introduce ascended gear), and without a sub fee, that means that a level 80 character (max level) can stop playing for a while, and come back and not be obsolete.
---
downsides: If you're looking for an MMO that's focused heavily on hardcore endgame content, this may not be the best immediate choice for you. There are some things (pve has 5 man fractals and 10 man raids, there's also pvp and wvw), but updates don't come as often as a lot of the hardcore community would like to see. Starting out, you'll have plenty to do, but if you're joining this game for the super dedicated hardcore content, I wouldn't say that this is the best choice per se.
---
Honestly, I'd love if GW2 had some kind of Allied races like WoW.
---
Just a different variations of currently existing races.
---
If not, give us norn Sylvari.
---
You can't just change a game to a new engine or do a similar massive update. You literally have to rebuild the ENTIRE game, which would make it GW3 and therefore not a performance update.
---
Instead of pressing one theyll be pressing X in no time!
---
I must say I like almost all of them. Nice job on this one, Anet.
---
Aye, after looking into it, it seems like the only real issue with these is just waiting for your daily herbs to come in.  And with a free garden plot you can pull in 4 plants worth (unsure if you get 2 herbs per plant like with normal garden or 1 per plant), which'll mean either 4 or 8 hours worth of food per day.  None of the other stuff needed seems super absurd, thankfully.
---
Dude, Chris Brown's "stans" are not people you should be using to make you're point. Those women who posted "he can beat me any day" are genuinely fucked in the head IMO
---
Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F. as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robyn F. picked up Brown's cellular phone and observed a three-page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.
---
A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.
---
Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.
---
Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'
---
The detective said "Robyn F." then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer.
---
Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'
---
After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!'
---
Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown.
---
Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand.
---
Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.
---
Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.
---
Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it.
---
Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness.
---
She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions.
---
Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.
---
I was looking at stats and SOS does seem to be the best for Ocx times
---
I'm going to wait for the announcement but truthfully I'm not expecting much. Most likely it's just living world season 5.
---
At this point I would shame ArenaNet for wasting dev time
---
Hot was rushed and PoF felt empty. I'd rather get the stuff with a drip if that'll mean it can be as polished, varied and fun as Dragon fall.
---
You're saying skills should be disabled in WvW?
---
[removed]
---
Not now, when the core swap event was out. You could bug it and cast your utility skills with almost no cooldown.
---
Source?
---
If you mean the garden plot, you get 1 free plot with the in game collection.
---
It's currently bugged, hence they have disabled them, and are fixing. 
---
But once that's up and running, it shouldn't cost any real world money.
---
There's some remnants of jotun structures. Most of what's left is start charts carved in large obeliscs and runestones that they probably do not remember how to use anymore. 
---
Their buildings were probably similar to them, made out of large gray rock.
---
We Know the Eye of The North was not created by any race known in GW1, and considering the rectangular motifs, it may have been Kodan.
---
&gt; Fractals haven't been touched in ages from what I've read. 
---
New fractals have been released here and there, and recently they've been reworking older fractals that people could just rush super easily to make them more challenging (and not "pop a protective bubble &amp; avoid all mechanics" anymore).  
---
So what you've read is false, at least regarding fractals \^\^
---
It's the anniversary sale period.
---
WTF did you expect?
---
This is the worst kind of trash post. You aren't asking for advice, you have already made up your mind. You just wanted a chance to :
---
1. Dump on those *filthy casuals* for who you have so much contempt
---
2. Reinforce your decision/opinions hoping that your post will stir up all like minded people to get on your bandwagon
---
3. Flex your *"elite"* credentials while peering down with sneering derision from the heights on the rest of the plebs
---
I am fairly new to GW2 and I read Reddit (amongst other things) to keep current with things and to try and pick up some hints/tips that will help my gameplay experience. I am already sick to death of posts like yours. 
---
Play or don't play. The decision is yours alone. If you are genuinely intending to base your decision solely off the advice of a bunch of strangers on the internet, then whether or not to play again is the least of your problems.
---
If the game doesn't offer the content you enjoy at the level you enjoy then it's not the right game for you. None of this is rocket science.....
---
The combat is just weird for a lot of different classes. It's a totally different game, and people don't like it, myself included. That said, with some changes, I think it could be done well. Even in its current state I'd say GW2 has some of the best underwater combat out there just because most games don't get it right.
---
I wont lie I was kind of impressed that they actually made skill sets and spear guns featuring underwater nets/mines and stuff. Most games just only let ya swim or it's the same skills as on land. I appreciate them trying something new even if it isn't the best.
---
Technically you could use the 2h primers from the garden or the ones in the gem store, but at that point you're likely better off just crafting the ascended food itself.
---
Sure, it just seems strange to completely block core gameplay altogether for an event in wvw. Better off just cancelling the event instead, no?
---
Gonna go shark hunting with a pistol, you're in charge of clearing my browser history if I don't make it back
---
Exactly my point, but they didn't do anything.
---
We do have an idle animation where we feed them more treats
---
Same face and hair picks and  then just adjustements to face/body? Not that hard if you think about it. Just make screenshots for every adjustement you made for your first character and use it for new ones.
---
Skritt playable race would be my dream, we need a better comedy race than Asura.
---
It wouldn't be so hard to do either, just take the Charr mesh, scale it down and BAM we have Biped/quadruped Skritt with existing armour that (mostly) fits.
---
I spent 103 key to get it. Want to exchange luck?
---
Your logic is "I don't want to pay" so......I really dunno what free games you're comparing the content of GW2 with. Sounds like you just wanted to shitboast.
---
&gt;Fractals haven't been touched in ages
---
Every two episodic releases
---
&gt;Pvp is laughable
---
Decent rewards if you're good and some unique skins, plus new maps. But it's quite true that the amount of people playing PvE is really small. Not that it's sinking though; it's been that way for awhile. Don't notice it much.
---
&gt;raids are decent but dps meters arent really an easy or commonly supported piece from anet
---
It's much more painfully obvious to tell who is failing mechanics in the newer raids. DPS isn't so important as is keeping up with the fight. Raids are also supposed to be released every other episodic release, but they've fallen a little short on that.
---
.....idling
---
Back around the launch of the game there was mention of an event where someone would discover something underwater and it would trigger a huge event that would change the landscape of a map. Was that a real thing that nobody has found yet or was it a planned idea that never went anywhere. (I remember it being mentioned a lot around launch and it haunts me to this day)
---
....or jam the Koda heads onto the Nords....
---
With the current LS formula they cannot hold 45 min presenting it that's why we are curious
---
Yes! Skritt are most definitely the bestest of them all! 
---
They don't even need to remember events of base game or even expansions. Idiot savant approach with unstable memories.
---
As time advances I miss more and more the enchantment/curse system. It could be reintroduced somewhat, but it wouldn't be the same. Eternal love for GW1 Spiteful Spirit + Clumsiness (+  Wandering Eye + Wastrel's Worry for an extra layer if needed)!
---
That's exactly how I've envisionned it. 
---
No more interferences between the two situations.

I consider "an inability to employ the US legal system effectively without tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to burn in the name of potentially bringing an abuser to justice" a glaring flaw. Evidently, you don't.
---
you killed him lol
---
This is due to power creep over the years. After revamp the event was big thing. Dragonfall however is easy and shallow right at release. You can fail and revive champ trio multiple times and still complete the meta. Pylon mechanic is close to irrelevant. Premise of the fight itself is a joke - we are killing purple pimples on the back of the dragon. Dermathologist dream.
---
The only thing that makes this meta popular is the loot.
---
&gt; What about this: New Warrior elite spec called Gladiator. They get a Minor trait that lets them use a shield with a 2-handed weapon and their new weapon is the Trident.
---
I've been told that there are massive technical issues surrounding the idea of spear or trident being used on land. As always, this ancient game engine holds back good ideas.
---
Nothing gets changed that much.  Tell me what did he get right, in that part I quoted?
---
I rarely watch vods other than to clip something, so the thought hadn't occurred to me at the time.
---
The issue is that it's 45 minutes long and it's a real stretch to suggest they're gonna have a 45 minute long trailer. So we're expecting some kind of showcase akin to an expansion/them telling us what they're doing to shake up the Living World format in the future to satisfy people who think there's nothing to do after they clear their green starbursts.
---
I think it's pretty realistic for us to expect a feature list/roadmap/something big. I.e. "Here's what's coming down the line."
---
DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER
---
Ah, probably a good idea. I still think they might have *something* for Alliances, even if it’s only about a minute of them saying “still working on it, more info soon” type of a thing.
---
They should make it like a Warhol exhibit, have it be a table with soup cans in stacks with pictures of Hype Train Colin on the labels.
---
I'll be contacting support if it goes on sale in the next week or two and they offered it full price with the cooking release.
---
Shake those money makers you naughty Skyscale girl!
---
Yea it just matters in outnumbered fights where they just freely pew pew you and you can't really do much about it if you don't have much mobility. You only have so many reflects etc.
---
Just made a mint strawberry Cheesecake. 10% outgoing heals, 100 concentration, 33 chance to gain might on crit.

That's very possible, if the Jade Sea returned to water, depending on how it happened, it could have caused a massive title wave that flooded the entire area. The slums are perfect for water to just flow through as a channel/valley.

Herb nodes. I have been to many maps, and always get Seeds from Herb nodes only.

I'm well aware. But someone else made a post about the other stats *including* this one 2 hours before it. So I'm confused as to why OP posted this one in the first place.

This joke has many layers to it.

FYI, both mounts are selection licenses in this pack (even though it doesn't specify for the 2nd mount unlock).

Careful with leaks. I am not even holding my breath for Elite Specs and those seem more likely.

---
3 Strawberries

Result:
---
10% Outgoing healing,  100 Concentration, 33% chance to Gain might on crit. 
---
Really weird food, was trying to find 10% outgoing, 100 healing &amp; 70 conc food.
---
Well, that is how game balance often works and it is not the first time for gw2 in particular. I mean elite spec gets released, gets nerfed over multiple patches, new spec comes out, rince and repeat. It was the absolute same discussion once seaweed salat got the hammer. Today nobody cares anymore.
---
In truth it should have been done way more often like that in the past with many things ingame, keeping the general powercreep of the game in check.
---
Since you're saying you'd aim for 'hardcore' content, I'm afraid there's no point for you. Pick up a stick and start digging holes, should be as fun as playing gw2 today. Or actually even better, there are people making money off of that on youtube. There are hardly any new fractals, a raid a year, and nothing out of it is challenging in a fun way, only annoying, mediocre, or both.
---
Many Skritt, Help!
---
I done a ton of blocking husks/egg in the past so I know it isnt too hard. That being said, this mechanics certainly are a step up from octovine where you can just bring any build and do it. The wurm mechanics are easier to mess up compared to octovine because of despawning kegs, and abominations killed early.
---
I would say that the success rate would be higher if wurm was a 80 map but still lower than octovine because its mechanics are less forgiving than octovine.
---
a little short? we're getting a raid a year XD
---
Exactly. I played WoW the same way I play GW2. It really isn't that different, except in GW2 you're actually surrounded by players in the open world who you have the option to talk to, whereas in WoW you may as well be in the zone all by yourself. So social...  
---
And raids and dungeons in GW2 require talking to people on the same level as WoW's.
---
Boy, is your face going to be red is this is a "Mobile thing"
---
It's extremely unlikely, I checked my account and such, only one PC authorized (this one) and only one IP address has ever had access to the account(my current home), I put it down to the fact that the account was considered inactive and therefore the characters were wiped, any it was no loss.
---
There are a lot of us who fall in between, it's not just two types of players. I mostly WvW and am on an active server, and know plenty of people still WvWing. I also love cosmetics.   
---
If you love to raid and you've done all the raids, then you probably won't have much to do. I'd never recommend GW2 as a game for raiders because it's not really a game that was designed for raiders and that is not, and hopefully will never be, their focus.
---
Dragon;s Stand with Dragonfall's loot. Oh lord.
---
Not to mention there are no big groups of people doing the same thing in WoW, so it feels even less like you're playing with people in WoW.
---
A little short of their "one raid every two episodes" goal, since TKoA didn't release with LWS4E6
---
I thought the career was being a part of a community providing useful guides and showcasing content for people but ok

Just got the announcement email again from anet... and looking at that picture I no longer think it looks like snow on the ground but rather waves...

go back to your incel forums
---
This also means you need to reacquire the varietal seeds, and also recraft the packets.  This means you'll need to constantly be salvaging various tiers of food to fuel your compost.  Sure is convenient that Halloween is coming up soon, and that it's the one festival we have that gives a variety of mostly useless food across a wide array of level tiers that most people don't even bother with anymore!

It's not a question of it being a "problem" or not, the fact is condi cleanse doesn't take care of most of the issues I described, and even if you filled your entire bar with condi cleanse, you'd eventually end up chilled because their auto attack cooldown is smaller than your utilities'.
---
I'm just pointing out how Anet loves to make annoying mobs, not hard to fight or challenging, but just annoying in open world, and now that we have mounts they double down on that as shown with PoF, so I just hope in season 5 they turn away from that aspect.
---
Ahh I missed this one, but I'm almost just in time for the Sept 3rd run! I can't wait :) Thanks so much for offering these again, I tried to defeat the corrupted facet bounty and it was just impossible.
---
Cc the griffon before it evades.
---
Yes there was the FurnaceTaken meme, and some spammed those "scary" frogs during the last official GW2 stream, but all that is directed at Anet as a company rather than their devs.
---
When some dev like BenP goes to a twitch stream to say hello in chat they are usually welcomed and even Teapot's chat behaves. There is always a couple of idiots no matter where you go, but it's not the norm.
---
If anything, I'd say most veterans agree that those devs need more help and aren't the cause of the game's shortcomings.
---
Man I never thought of that ! Oh wait.
---
Yeah it works on regular griffons, until a veteran shows up and CCing him just makes him fly away even faster.
---
Is there a Mini Kormir's Messanger?
---
"Okay, go south now. Further, further…"
---
Nothing bad, just using Addon.
---
She claims you were under water alone with her 20 years ago. #WetToo
---
Defining features for GW2 for me are: possibly best combat system of all MMOs, easy to get into and pick up again, game does not force you to grind, easy to gear and spec characters, many different fun game modes, best mounts out of all MMOs, no sub fee, no grind, no invalidating old content, good community, many convenience items, no gear treadmill. 
---
I might think of more but those are definitely the big ones
---
Thats definetly how it is not and should not be.
---
It is only finger pointing until theres a proper trial. We have seen this before how accusations have ruined people's life even when they have been found innocent.
---
It's like driving a car with a TSI engine, the chassis of Jaguar E-Type and the handling of a bumper car.
---
" One of the remaining dragons can influence time and is trying to use that to change history. Kinda like fractals but for everything. Lots of returning stuff like Zhaitain, even some dungeons getting re-used. Meanwhile the human gods want to abandon Tyria because they think it’s too risky to stay, could destroy everything. "  
---
This alone proves this is an asspull, anyone that played PoF story knows that Balthazar went rogue because the gods were completely leaving Tyria behind, there was already the exodus to The Mists, now they were moving on to some other location.  We saw two empty god realms in the personal story, met Kormir when she was basically on her way out the door.  We also saw three empty god realms during the first instance of War Eternal, there was barely any landmass left because Kralkatorrik had eaten nearly everything.
---
 We also know the spheres of influence of the Elder Dragons, with the exception of Steve whom is unknown and presumed to be water none of them are time.  Zhaitan was death and shadows, Mordremoth was mind and plants,  Kralkatorrik was crystals, Primordus is fire, and Jormag is ice.  It is possible but highly unlikely that Steve has time as its sphere of influence, we are also unlikely to find out as they're teasing Jormag and Norn themed content for season 5.
---
Now I have to train my daily gathered to cooking 500. ＞︿＜
---
Just one more reason why they should make crafting fully account-wide.
---
You’re literally just trying to antagonize people. You mocked him being a “pro player” and a “white knight” and completely went off when all he basically said wS use more CC. You’re intentions to simply communicate things gets thrown off track completely when you constantly throw bitch fits. Good luck to you sir.
---
Removing the timegate of fractal daily rewards would be insane. Daily fractals gives so much gold, and you and I both know that if they removed the cap, people would find a way to exploit that and farm fractals to no end. Natural skill barriers are impossible to add without making fractals an ungodly level of difficulty/length. People will find a way to farm them, devalue the rewards, and make it so difficult for a new player fresh into the game to catch up with everyone else who's been riding the wave of gold income.
---
You could argue that hey, maybe only account-bound fractal rewards like the RNG ascended drops shouldn't be timegated, since they don't fuel the economy in any way, but that feeds into the other game's reward systems. If you can farm fractals without any limiting factor beyond skill level and get a fairly respectable chance of an ascended drop each run, then ascended becomes devalued in other areas of the game. Who cares about getting Tequatl's Hoard when a good 4 hour marathon of T4 fractals gets you thrice the amount of ascended gear? (Veterans are already feeling this to an extent since after a certain point the game throws ascended stuff to you like hotcakes)
---
We can go deeper down the rabbit hole; who cares about the Deldrimor Steel Ingots, Bolts of Damask, etc, and all of the ingredients required to make them when ascended is so much easier to get through sheer grind? Why would ascended gear even feel rewarding if everyone who dedicates a few farming marathons doing the same content over and over again get their ascended gear without much investment?
---
I agree with you that timegates *can* feel frustrating and lazy... but in a massively multiplayer, social game like this with many reward systems and an economy, timegates are often a valuable or even crucial tool to keep things in check.
---
Argue that something like the timegate on the Skyscale is annoying all you want, and I'll agree with you. Arbitrarily waiting for 2 hours for Gorrik to finish his research or waiting an entire day for your baby Skyscale to feel hungry again *is* annoying. But timegates on reward systems are more than just a lazy way of padding content.
---
The "New Horizons" theme makes it sound as if we were going to go to the Far North, the Deep Desert, and the Unending Ocean.
---
I don't think anything like that was *ever* stated. Only thing we were told is, much like the Elonian quarter in DR, there was going to be a Canthan quarter that was removed and replaced with the collapse.
---
Never heard anything about plans for actual Cantha, just idle speculation from fans.
---
I just realised I should have made my joke character, "Feed Me Seimur", my chef, not my random DH
---
Norn win the space race by literally being the only race to survive the nuclear fallout from those two races trying to sabotage one another.
---
&gt; I admit that it is a very situational roamer
---
I was thinking about this the other day. In open world it really seems to excel in bunker defense scenarios where you can pick off mobs as they come but everything else requires a lot of movement which negates their best abilities that come with the kneeling &amp; stealing. And heaven help you if a boss has a reflect.
---
What part isn't accountwide?
---
I’m not sure what’s the best way to word this question is but I’ll try my best.  
---
With the recent organisational changes at Arena Net, have there been any changes to how the GW2 Team plans, tests and delivers major content?  For example will Season 5 be delivered in a different way to Season 4?
---
You can get the new meats and seeds on any character once they are unlocked.

When are quaggan going to be playable?

PoF had betas and stress tests though.

What limits it to 12? I haven't crafted any ascended food yet. Just curious.

If they know the email/password combination, they can also verify that you are using the same password, by hashing the leaked password against their own hash.
---
Looks like an abomination imo
---
and we've seen accusations when they were found guilty, i literally just said "we dont know"
---
If they were going to add spears and such why doesn't the new gem store skins have underwater weapons?
---
And some real garbage BLC drops, too. Ouch.
---
They have a test server. There are people who play on it.  Saying they don't do testing is factually incorrect. You think this game is buggy? You have no idea how many bugs would be introduced if they did no testing.
---
The truth is the test cycle from alpha to launch probably isn't long enough.
---
God forbid this become some kind of massively multiplayer online game
---
I just picked this up.... this is really interesting. It's hopefully going to take a lot of pointless food out of the economy and give value back to a lot of those herb nodes.

'Stop playing', is more respectful to your time than 'grind more'.

By having most of it before the episode came out ;)
---
Noticed there is no power &amp; condi damage food.
---
Kinda sucks as there are a number of specs that can easily cap the conditions that they use.
---
I did not want to dignify that tirade of contempt with any kind of rebuttal. 
---
But on reflection I felt I need to say this :
---
Anyone who has such contempt for the games new players has no thought or care for the future, simply their own self interest. All games have a certain level of player attrition, it's the natural course of things. Therefore all games need new players to help with longer term viability. Your failure to grasp this simple and obvious truth says far more about you than I ever could.
---
There's no one riding on the skyscale tho, all I can see is the new lava skyscale with the very fat tale
---
That and there likely are not enough of them that actually do the testing.
---
These all seem super good.
---
I bet the Condition Duration and -10% reduced damage taken is gonna be huge for WvW.
---
Looking forward to seeing these things on the floor.
---
Not a clue about that, but you might be right.
---
Thank you for your insight! That's very helpful.
---
Funny enough, I got inspired to ask this question because I want to see if any form of Staff Ele would still be decent if only for Fractals. I know a lot of people didn't like it but I loved how staff ele was a high risk high reward class and being a good staff ele meant something. The skill ceiling has been considerably lowered since those days. Maybe it's for the better in the long run, but I still miss the old days.
---
I’m not really referring to this in particular. I’m just saying in general. I don’t know the situation at all, so I don’t really have an opinion on it.
---
Well looking at the other posts it seems you need one of items grown from the plot. You can have up to 3 plot if you buy two more from the TP. Each plot gives 4 plats so ... 12. I guess you could get a bit more if the plants give more than one per gather. Although 6 hours of buffs per day is probably enough for most people but if you don't buy the plots that goes down to 2 hours. 
---
One the other hand there is the primer thing that you are supposed  to be able to buy the recipe for from the gardener but I am not sure if that requires buying the gemstore plots to unlock.
---
Can you explain me please what's the point of leveling up in this game if you eventually choose a specialization that completely changes all of your abilities?! You spending a lot of time leveling from 1 to 80 and then you get almost a new hero, kind of. The point of level progression in any game is that you learning your character, how to use his ability efficient so when you reach max lvl you have some skill to show in endgame group content. And in this game when you feel you finally became really good with your kit - it changes completely and you have to learn again and also should forget all the abilities you used up to this point? Why bother getting good if you will leave your abilities behind and switch to new ones? Am I correct? I just downloaded a game and trying to figure out how everything works. And I'm really disappointed in the system I mentioned. 
---
Ex., I want to play as a guardian because I like the Dragonhunter's abilities. So you tell me I have to play guardian with base kit of abilities which I dislike in order to finally being able to have the abilities I like at the very end? It's like starting the game with one class in order to gain the completely different class later. This is the weirdest and uncomfortable thing I ever seen in games. I don't like it. Come on, I really want to play that Dragonhunter, but I don't wanna play the melee guardian with mace or sword and shield. 
---
The same thing goes with the Ranger. I want to be a Druid, but I don't want to waste so many hours/weeks/months playing an archer in order to be able to play a completely different class...Seriously, who and why came up with this? I don't know what to do. Can't imagine playing a class I don't enjoy. I know there's a level up boost so I can skip the thing I don't like, but obviously it's a bad idea skipping the 'base game' for a new player...So guys I really don't know what should I do, lol.

This sort of shit never would have happened when King Joko was here.
---
I **despise** that this is a thing but you're completely correct. Without some solid evidence, I just can't be bothering to pay attention to every single accusation thrown around these days. And it's completely tragic that this is the case because I guarantee you that some innocent person out there is going to suffer horribly because of it and I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
---
But the truth is that if I took the time to pay attention to every accusation, I would never have time for anything else.

Hearts! I found hearts to be the most enjoyable method for my personal tastes. It felt different than the usual mat farming grind, I was able to memorize each map and get faster with each run, and it gave me more interaction with the local NPCs/familiarity with the maps. For me, that worked well and didn’t burn me out. I’m also obsessed with alts and had plenty of characters to use.
---
Another good option would be WvW or PvP tracks, provided that you’re experienced in these game modes and can fill a reward track quickly. 
---
If you’re going more slowly, consider doing meta events to break things up, or stopping by the Dragonfall vendors to exchange VM for a couple map currencies each day. It’s not a huge amount, but it helps^^
---
Well you can always adjust your gear around the food and see if you can get more favorable stats that way.
---
That thread is a total joke, don't take anything it says seriously.
---
This has been suggested before, and I think it's really important that more attention is called to LFG tool. Also, more attention needs to be drawn to the idea that so much is on timers.
---
I've lost count of the number of people who are new/or just not paying attention, who rock up to a Dragon Stand map mid cycle and then come and post that the zone is dead. No timer, no LFG tool.
---
The timer and LFG tool work hand in hand to get me into many events that others are missing. 
---
The LFG tool also needs some love, but playing without it right now now seriously curtail my ability to play, or at least play profitably.
---
Didn't like the Sword. Got the hammer and axe
---
One more herb/garnish: Cultivated Peppercorn Seed gives 10% damage reduction as its bonus. I've only bothered discovering the sous vide steak as of yet but I assume there are recipes for all 12 of the potential stat bonuses.
---
**MOLTEN COOOOOOOORE**
---
Try to find a home instance to farm daily particuarlly if you're taking your time. You could be half there on every zone if you farm someone's home instance daily. A full home instance has nodes from every single zone. 
---
This and play the zones. Do hearts, park multiple characters on easier hearts even.  Open chests in those zones. 
---
The difference between how I play and how others play is that I stay in zones and do metas and just enjoy the events and explore when they come out. So by the time the collection came out, I only needed currency from Dragonfall. I had all the rest of it.
---
You can lead a deer to water, but if you can get him to float on his back, you've got something.

Does anyone actually cares if shes a girl or guy? I mean, i look up to her website back then and i still will do the same even if shes a dude. Male or female, his/her website is helpful.

I’ve been saying for years warrior should get an elite spec that lets them use 2handed weapons in one hand. Don’t even need to change any of the skills, just let warriors mix and match. Greatsword+Axe would be dope as hell

---
GAH! Thanks for that. Will work on that next.
---
I only read your TLDR. My point still stands though.
---
You mention that you haven’t finished Holosmith. You’re better off not running a partially traited holosmith and sticking to a core Engineer. (Learned this the hard way myself when I ran an incomplete Berserker, and struggling massively as a result.)
---
[You can find some engineer builds here. It also has some core engineer builds.](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Engineer) You also don’t need to get the ascended gear, exotics will do for open world. A good build makes all the difference!
---
Fuck ALL THAT SHIT. DUAL IPOS CLAWS!

Somebody ought to send some to ANet for the anniversary celebration. Get them to eat it on stream.

Yeah, i replanted after reset. Thank you.
---
FYI, you still say that the food can be divided into four groups, not five as shown with your later edit.  Awesome list though, mega thanks for gathering it all up into a single post!
---
Wow, calm down, dude. 
---
Have you even reported this bug in an official way? Or did you just cry without doing anything constructive?
---
I'm at the same step I was at this afternoon when I went to buy the licenses but didn't have the gold. I made the gold and went back to  get the licenses and the NPC is in its pre-cooking-500 state. I'm not jumping to conclusions here, I'm fairly confident about what's going on. The most recent mini patch that disabled the garden plots (because of course that had a glitch in it) also disabled this NPC from seeing I'm at the required step.
---
I'm so tired of the devs fucking up releases and hiding behind the spaghetti code defense. If it's that big of a problem, get a fucking test server running.
---
I've run into this myself. It's the only thing I have left to do and the dialogue option to buy stuff from him is missing.
---
I went ahead and posted an image
---
What are the stats for each of these?
---
Answered
---
Really great work there!
---
Reading comprehension. OP already said that both PoF *and* HoT had beta tests (as well as the game itself btw.).
---
The crafting areas are elaborate meta jokes that deconstruct a dozen or so tropes and genres?
---
Actually it's factually wrong. They do have test servers and they do testing. It's a known fact, saying they don't do testing is just false.
---
ok change your elite into a core trait.
---
how are you geared?
---
i.e. i have a pure zerker guardian.
---
If you play WvW or PvP, the reward tracks give you 50+ currency.
---
There are some simple [guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/br8kjl/how_to_easily_obtain_season_4_currencies/) about how to obtain it.    
---
    
---
I literally just did this part of the collection and it took me about 2 weeks, i used 4 characters and went map by map, doing every heart on each character. Thats an average of about 80 currency per day per map. Some maps like Jahai have events you can do as well which just speed up the process even further.

---
Had the same prob. You have to have the meat from the step before in your inventory
---
Looks like you're getting build help, so I'll recommend https://gw2crafts.net/ to help level crafting quickly and cheaply.
---
&gt; lmao i'm the last person to defend anet.
---
Actually this time you were one of the first
---
GW2 don't like to group up. They don't mind playing along side other players. What they don't like is having to rely on or having people rely on them. That's just the way it is. As I said in another comment. If you have a boss on a map than you will get a hundred people running to fight that boss. It's the same with things like bounties, etc.
---
Ask people to group up to do a 1 hour dungeon/fractal/raid and you will get maybe 2 responses.
---
&gt; Can you explain me please what's the point of leveling up in this game if you eventually choose a specialization that completely changes all of your abilities?!
---
I mean, you only gain one small set of new skills, 5 utility and a new weapon set.
---
&gt;  You spending a lot of time leveling from 1 to 80 and then you get almost a new hero, kind of. 
---
The elite spec is more of an extension of the core class. It still uses a lot of the base build, with just some extra features. It's not really a new hero, just the same one with more stuff
---
&gt;  it changes completely and you have to learn again and also should forget all the abilities you used up to this point?
---
Again, no, you only really get a small handful of new abilities. You still retain most of the features of the core class
---
&gt; Ex., I want to play as a guardian because I like the Dragonhunter's abilities. So you tell me I have to play guardian with base kit of abilities which I dislike in order to finally being able to have the abilities I like at the very end? 
---
Some of the abilities you won't be able to use until you become a dragonhunter, but that doesn't mean that everything fundamentally changes between guardian and dragonhunter. 
---
&gt; Come on, I really want to play that Dragonhunter, but I don't wanna play the melee guardian with mace or sword and shield. 
---
Then don't. Guardian and dragonhunter both use scepters as their main ranged damage output, that doesn't change. Longbow is largely a utility weapon on dragonhunter anyways. 
---
&gt; I don't want to waste so many hours/weeks/months playing an archer in order to be able to play a completely different class.
---
Ranger doesn't mean archer here. It has the option to use a bow, yes, but it also gets a large portion of its output from melee weapons (greatsword, sword) and medium ranged weapons (axe). You'll still likely be using those as a druid anyways.
---
The only thing I can think of is you need to have the filet in your inventory for the two gold items to show up.  If it's in your material storage the NPC wont sell to you.
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
Cooking on my Necro ...got most of my seeds on my Guardian with o/500 cooking

I got the warclaw very slowly by just doing wvw dailies that don't really involve any pvp (veteran creature, land claimer, monuments). Took me around a month I think. Then I just had to tag along for one random tower cap and one keep cap I think, neither of which involves me pvping at all.
---
Having said that, the warclaw is actually pretty useless in pve (it's basically a strictly worse raptor or jackal), so all you're missing out on is the visuals.
---
"what's it like being a golem? Does it have a mother?"  XD
---
No, the goal with single player versions of the raids is to drive investment in the game mode. More people will probably do raids as a side effect of that goal and there is a fair chance that more people will join GW2 to raid if there is enough investment in the raiding content but that's also a side effect.
---
The alternative is this. A/Net is not going to invest some of their limited resources in a game mode that is played by 1% of the population. It doesn't make any sense. They can throw money at it until they are blue in the face but that won't make regular GW2 players suddenly start raiding.
---
Think of this as a trick or a something that pulls the wool over the solo players eyes. It's something else that reuses the raiding content in a way that appeals to a much wider audience to generate funding for that game mode.
---
My own judgement at this point is that you area person who lets feelings drive your judgement, and should never be let into any important positions where you could harm others with power. 
---
This is my judgement that seems to just be as valid as yours on the topic. I do not personally know you, but since we started to throw assumptions and judgements based on couple lines of words and lack of facts.
---
I don’t know what your skill and attack rotation is like but I want to add that Engineer has one of the more complex rotations and being as on point with it will help boost your numbers.
---
For rifle Holosmith you want to alternate between using Photon Forge attacks 3 , 4 and auto attacks. Before over heating, hit 3 and give yourself stability.
---
Get out of Forge and use rifle 4 for a knock back and knockdown. Rifle 5 on top of the target. This works well on any enemy but you won’t get a knock back on anything Champion level or higher.
---
what if you plant it on your main account and gather it with an alt account? would you get the gathers without ever having to replant?
---
His music will stay the same regardless of validity of the accusation.
---
Because it's all about immersion and exploring in this game.
---
Yes but he will be removed from all future projects, meaning we will not receive any more of that amazing music. It really does add and extra layer to TES and GW ya know?
---
Sounds like you already know your answer and just used this to shit on people who play differently than you. But in case you still wanted advice I'd say go ahead and don't bother playing. No need for people like you.
---
I don't know why I made Kraitkin, but I love the wiggly eel stick
---
It doesnt. He wasnt working on gw2 music after core release
---
They are 100% the “missing icons” for elite spec weapons. We haven’t had elite specs with: Trident, Speargun, Scepter, Pistol, Mace, Spear and Focus. And that’s exactly what these icons are.
---
IF and it is a big IF (because we have to wait if it is possible to proof the accusations) then it underlines even more what an bad person he really is, but remember he does not perform the music alone, there still musicians behind the music we love from him who are probably good people. So if you have a problem with the music now try to forget him and think about the musicians who performed this music
---
Chances are tho, he could work on a Guild Wars 3, or another Arena net project, or another TES game
---
What have dungeons got to do with raids? Dungeons had already been superseded with fractals when their support was dropped. I don't see a similar situation with raids. 
---
I like the fact that, because you have no coherent argument, you want to just try and suggest I don't actually play the content.
---
Try piecing together a more robust argument with different reasoning in your next discussion, instead of lazily creating a straw argument that shows you can't critically think.
---
Assuming there will ever be gw3 or another anet project. Even if, long time ago they switched to in house composers and the return of Soule in context of gw amd anet is unlikely regardless.
---
Yeah, he dipped shortly after GW2 came out so you only have to worry about Elder Scrolls. And considering that TES VI already got teased, the score for that could be done by now, resulting in an easier transition to a new composer who writes in a similar style.
---
Do you play on EU? If so I can boost you through PoF maps to unlock your elite spec at least. You don't need anything except for a basic raptor, I got everything else covered.
---
I don't see them adding a fist weapon.
---
I don’t think it would’ve been unlikely in the pay, but now, him returning to an Anet project is never gonna happen
---
Which server is most active during the evening after i get back from work? GMT +8, playing from malaysia, currently in JQ, been away from the game for some time
---
Most of his scores as featured in the game are actually MIDI. A few were rerecorded later by a live orchestra. The difference is pretty noticeable to me as a musician. Maclaine started recording his scores live when possible, and that's one part of why they sound so much better. (The other part being that he's willing to compose in a wider range of styles, etc etc.)
---
It's a pretty common thing in games, also in GW2. 
---
"Deliver (show) item XY" quests are nothing special, nor the requirement to have Item XY in your inventore to progress. Especially when the quest say exactly this to you.
---
Well, aside from the fact that we had raids tested on testing servers, and aside from the fact that they've allowed people to apply for a testing server and aside from the fact that devs have said so in the past, and aside from the fact that I have had devs in my guild who've talked about the testing servers, and I actually know someone who is a tester (but I'm not supposed to because they've all signed an NDA, aside from all that, yeah, you're probably right. /s
---
Sounded like another of those "HURR-DURR IF THEY DIDN'T ADD EVERYTHING YEARS AGO NO POINT IN ADDING IT NOW BECAUSE DEAD GAEM".
---
Are you trying to say that between, the release of episode 4 (since the leak is about episode 5 and 6), that would be about 6-7 months, they completely scrapped both the raid they were working on, and the maps they had planned for 5 and 6 (cause his leak about episode 5 is also hilariously wrong), and complete redid both of them in 6 months?  Utter lunacy.
---
Ah yes. The 2 biggest groups of people here, people who are immature and people who thinks they are mature to call them out.
---
Why are you so sure that this is a bug? This may also be something intended.
---
Maybe they just want these food to be placed only in public areas to share it.
---
And don't get me wrong, i don't like it, but it can be a possibility.
---
Cool. Never saw any of that and have yet to see them put out releases without bugs that would be caught with even the most basic of tester checks so forgive me if I'm skeptical that they have a robust testing group. Particularly with these most recent releases.
---
I mean, Hans Zimmer is personally terrible person and his music most of the time is made by ghostwriters aswell... However, I don't care about who the person is behind the track, I simply enjoy the music. And regardles of the outcome of this accusation against Soule, his music we know won't change.
---
They have a testing group. I don't know how robust it is, because obviously I'm not a tester. But, how robust the group is wouldn't matter if the stuff they're given to test they don't have enough time to test, that's my point. From what I understand, testers are players and they're not employees. They're not paid. 
---
I've played games with far more and worse bugs then this. Have you ever played a Bethesda game at launch?
---
7k is nothing though, that can be achieved in a year at most.
---
If this is true you are going to dislike his music?
---
L  M  A  O    
---
This is obviously unintended but it's so, so fitting.
---
Can confirm, same thing happened to our guild tonight.
---
Probably want people to announce feasts going down in the Aerodrome so that more people can benefit... or they somehow forgot to test it in a raid :)
---
No, however it’s a shame since I would like to see more of his music
---
Well this is already something.
---
Like they tested ascended food not being usable in raids? Or warclaw not breaking into literally every single objective in wvw?
---
Right.
---
I'm usually not salvaging that much stuff at once but for a moment I thought this was an issue on my side or that the salvaging stopped after 1-2k items in a "That's enough for me, I'm out" fashion.

I was from EU, don't know about NA you are right.

And no, i didn't mean you did not play the game. I meant that maybe you remember more than just vanilla wow in the experience you describe.

You laugh now..  but this posted a while back might actually come to life.. http://guildwars2.waveofshadow.com/  O_O

Their mode until competition \*finally\* releases, at least. Crowfall and Camelot Unchained are both gunning for the job, starting to get to early betas, maybe finally out by 2021 in some respect?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The community right now is swirling the drain harder than the toilet bowl meta of HoT. In talking with a few guilds looking for player homes, a lot of them have just said they're out as of this month. It's hella disheartening to see a mode with so much promise just die on the vine from lack of proper attention. A lot of the groups have been moving to FF14, and group play in games like Overwatch to try and get the PvP itch down on the side. PvE may not be WvW, but at least raidbosses are better than doors on empty servers.
---
I don't know how you miss getting inside every objective on a new mount, basically the main feature that needs testing before it gets in the game.
---
I'm not making assumptions because I see what's happening. You're making assumptions by saying that they test stuff yet they always seem to miss the most trivial things.
---
Not to mention that these took months to fix.
---
For real? Lmao, that’s even a meta food. Incredible that they missed that one.
---
What part of I know a tester personally did you not get? This isn't something just made up. I know for a fact that testing occurs period. Anyone with half a brain knows that. How effective testing in depends on the testers themselves, including the time they have to test. I don't know how many WvW testers there are, how long they were given to test it, what their skill level is. I don't know how long the devs had from the time the testers tested it till release date. But if you seriously don't think anyone tests this game, then I have nothing left to say to you. Nothing at all. Because I guarantee you that's not the first thing that would have been tested. The collection would have been the first thing.
---
yes definitely, i still hope is just a bug
---
Lol this is spot on.
---
never use incomplete trait lines also get a full exotic set
---
press h, go to equipment, screen shot, post here.
---
=)
---
also, know that some players have a rotation of skills.
---
I saw that too but figured that in programming “console” has different meanings. As well as the fact that if they do make console ports then they should also make gamepad support with a proper UI for the PC version.  
---
I honestly doubt they’ll do any of that.
---
I like Asura for their sarcasm.
---
If you want to eat in raid then sleep on dungeon!
---
I still hope it comes at some point, I do RP so I am in need for housing :D

Another MMO isn't gw2 though and gw2 isn't in alpha.

Some food items say "+1% all experience gained". What does it mean? What the difference with the regular +10% experience food?
---
You're right. No other MMO ever has bugs that should have been caught. No other MMO ever is badly tested. All Bethesda games come out of the box working perfectly and you don't know enough to have this conversation. Have a great day, I'm out of here.  Feel free to get the last word.
---
There is two type of damage in gw2, 1 direct damage and the other one condition damage or damage over time. Direct damage is self explanatory, condition damage is damage like bleeding, burning, torment etc. You can see what type of damage a weapon or utility skill does by hovering over the skill. Condition damage is usually in red small icons, like 5 stacks of torment for 5 secs and similarly. The condition may stack intensity (how much damage it does per second) or duration(how long the condition affects). The condition damage may have a secondary nature as well, like say torment does more damage when the enemy is moving. 
---
The stats you're using is wrong in the sense that you should usually go for one type of damage. If you have take direct damage stats then the other should be related to that. Like the helmet which you are using has power, precision and ferocity stats. Power is direct damage, precision is the chance to hit critically( deal more damage) and ferocity is the amount by which your critical damage will hit more. So it would be better if all your gear have same berserker stats in open world to deal more damage as condition stats work well for elongated fights. 
---
Next the runes if all matching provides extra benefit, say you have 6 matching runes on all armour pieces, then the 6th one would provide an extra benefit. You have 4 matching runes, can be seen as 4 shows in blue colour and the rest with 1 in blue. Ideally your runes should be related to the gear stats you chose, if you go for power build, put 6 runes of type which has stats power/ferocity/precision. 
---
Currently you have boon duration, which is good but with open world and more solo play it won't help much. Boons are kinda opposite of conditions.
---
You can read about all of these in more detail on gw2 wiki as well!
---
I've never found the looking for group tool to be particularly hard to find or in an illogical place. I agree that the game doesn't really direct you to use it, but the whole tutorial experience for the game is pretty poor so that's par for the course. Personally though, I think a bigger issue lies within sharding for meta events, there really should never be a reason why you need to lfg for a map meta, the game should handle that on its own.
---
Can we first fix all main features before we add new fluff features that get abandoned by the devs with the next patch?
---
It's not about being perfect, it's about releasing features that lack/have mandatory parts bugged. Food in raids may not be mandatory, but mount jumping certainly was.
---
The ceiling for Ele went up a shitton with the introduction of Weaver. Core Ele and Tempest are both laughably easy with staff.
---
Really great thread. Thanks for all the effort ordering them and linking everything. This is really helpful. 
---
Those -10% damage taken foods look like they'd be quite useful for PuG/Training Raid groups. Though I expect the meta will settle on the damage and lifesteal proc.
---
Housing! Like Wildstar did it
---
this level of logic is a step too far for him/her
---
If you are WvW or sPvP player, then you have access, through the various Reward Tracks, to a loads of [Desert Crafting Material Coffers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Desert_Crafting_Material_Coffer). You can choose [Pitcher of Desert-Spiced Coffe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pitcher_of_Desert-Spiced_Coffee) from the coffer. It's an exotic 80lvl feast - you can salvage it into 10 Exotic Extract of Nourishment. This should cover all your needs for exotic extracts.
---
No. I'm saying that giving out a "Customer Appreciation Package" but don't give to all your customers based on the country they live in is discriminating a population group (I will not give other examples). They should have chosen a different token of appreciation (eg. Black Lion Claim Ticket) if they wanted to show their 'appreciation'. 
---
Furthermore it doesn't make sense they don't give out an item to people in a country that we still can get in game.
---
Where can we see all the ascended food versions. Im trying to find it, but no page seems to have it yet
---
The usual "+10% xp" often mean and read "+10% xp from kills". the "+1% all experience" will also apply to event rewards and depending on the food also to WvW XP if I am not mistaken.
---
In a game that provides this much love to the concept of a dynamic open world with thousands of events, I think there is a very real chance we won't ever get housing. But since they haven't said so, I guess all we can do is wait. :)
---
"It's still gambling", even if it's for free. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I’m looking to eventually gear up all 9 professions with ascended equipment, but in the meantime (while buying/making everything) what are some good intermediate options for exotic armor/weapons with HoT or PoF stat combos?
---
Is it better to just make the exotic versions? Make some combo of base game stats?
---
I’m mostly looking for vipers and harriers, but if the tactic would work on all stats that would be better.
---
Ah, so it is more along the lines of: "If I can't have it no one else should either!!"
---
You can throw the blame at ArenaNet all you want, but fact still remains that the party to blame here is your government which forced ArenaNets hand in banning these things in your country. 
---
A Black Lion Claim Ticket would be incredibly limited and boring though, you can only use it for a single thing while with the Key and Chest you have a chance to get quite a bit of nice and useful stuffs. (It is of course also the whole deal with them hoping to get people to buy more keys). 
---
They have been giving Key and Chest several times before, why should they suddenly change that just because a single country decided to limit their population?
---
Grinded hearts on alts. It's not fun.
---
Or just use a VPN.
---
I think there are two possibilities: 
---
* Less likely: gathered plant is bonded to the account that planted it
---
* It can be harvested by anyone and thus, it could be potentially possible to visit other people home instances but THEN: people who operate on multiple accounts will be locked with ascended plants they can't use.
---
We have 3 failed attempts to implement housing. Home instance, guild hall, sun's refuge. How many more failed attemps for housing do you want?
---
GAINAX PHYSICS.
---
I don't think that this is relevant, it could be the land version of those.
---
Professions don't have to have a specific color, you can design any profession around any color scheme that you like for your character:)
---
A lot of it really depends on your personal preference, but I will say that my favorites are the bows and guns. I do also like the staff as well.
---
The bladed weapons just look too much like a paddle for my taste, and the blunt melee weapons also suffer from massively oversized syndrome. But that goes for basically all the ascended weapons as they use the same models. I know some people like that look, but it isn't my cup of tea.
---
Who needs quality insurance when you have a player base
---
DEKeys from DnT used to have a spreadsheet that calculated it, so im guessing Excel might still be used for the mathes and then its go and try it?
---
just done rush upgrading.  youll get it eventually.
---
Those players that just lost in a final aren't losing "rating" for it, however in this game we lose a very significant amount of points that are used to value our ratings, that's the reason of this post, which you clearly failed to understand.
---
It looks... weird but I dig it lol
---
No. That's on Anet's end. It's probably easier for them to tag any sales that contain lootboxes regardless of the price.
---
I genuinely want them to release Cantha just so we are done with this.
---
Well they could have given you another item (at least a handful of statuettes for instance).
---
Lootboxes are not banned... PAID lootboxes are. It's still possible to get the free keys when you do the story missions in belgium.
---
I think the point of u/Orvall is that the FREE one is still locked. He is not talking about the regular paid ones.
---
Hope was your mistake.
---
&gt;Discrimination based on laws is very much legal
---
Yet it is not the law.
---
Paid lootboxes are illegal, not free ones (like the one you get in story missions).
---
every time you change the stats of an ascended weapon in the mystic you get a different set of coloured skin - as others have already said. Wiki it!
---
I just shoved my hoard in the bank for when I knew what I wanted from it, I still don't!
---
How does malice work, and how do you see that telegraph of the big damage one?
---
It's all RNG and the best stuff has the lowest drop chance. Slot machines will remain slot machines.
---
As with many questions, the wiki is your best friend!

* [Inscription](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Recipe:_Trailblazer%27s_Orichalcum_Imbued_Inscription)
---
No, free lootboxes are not:
---
1) you can get them in story missions.
---
2) if it was true, all loot bags and boxes would be considered "lootboxes".
---
no actually, keys still drop in the game and BL chests can still be found in open world or bought on the trading post, it's only on the gemstore where they're disabled
---
Maybe you should stop paying taxes to your government as they are the ones who did this. Please update us later how it goes.
---
Dafuq I just watched?  
---
Bring me the bleach, please, **all of it**!
---
Problem occurs when people outside your group control your access to your food (troll spams shitty feasts on top of yours). Just let us put them down in instances, please.
---
Can only read that line in his voice xD
---
I agree with you. In this case it is not the legal term 'discrimination'. If you go to a store and everyone gets a present because of 'appreciation' and you don't (because whatever reason), would you feel inclined to keep going to that store?
---
I will keep playing GW2 (ofc) but I no longer feel a happy customer because they clearly didn't think about all their customers when giving out 'customer appreciation packages'.
---
I thought shield was the ONLY weapon that was exempt from the dual-wield mechanic.
---
Cilantro is already down to 49s for [seeds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Varietal_Cilantro_Seed) and 13s for [meat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cut_of_Quality_Red_Meat)
---
Being FORCED to share in a social MMO game is pretty bad, yea...
---
I think they just added elite weapon icons for all the remaining weapons, but I don't see them being used.
---
Holy moly I stacked over 250 of these coffers because I was tired of constantly opening them just to get a few flax fibers which are close to useless anyway. Guess hoarding sometimes pays off.
---
Uninspired waste of $$$
---
Ah, finally someone who understands how that kind of behaviour can pique someone's interest. I think there might actually be dozens of us, heh.
---
It makes perfect sense.
---
You can get booted from instance by bug or disconnect or whatever and you lose your feast. Instances are temporary and thus putting there such items makes no sense. 
---
Putting them in Aerodrome is the spot where most of raiders will see them and they will persist for their duration as well.
---
My government didn't give out 'customer appreciation packages'. A company where I am a customer decided to give them out and told me and my fellow countrymen we don't get them. I is it illogical I don't feel appreciated as a customer?
---
Good point! I actually had that thought, too, but I completely forgot about it. Dulfy Incorporated, yeah. Makes sense. Maybe it started out as some bloke playing at e-girly and it became a bit of a company.
---
And please remove that stupid spam block, it's impossible to lead a pug raid with that shit without relogging every 30min
---
Oh... what?  All ascended foods are feasts?  I haven't really looked into the new ascended cooking much, but this sounds kinda... err... meh. I don't know.  Now in addition to the gathering/hero guild banners littering the world, there's going to be feasts everywhere, right?  I kind of hoped they would instead just add some unique combinations or effects to the ascended food to expand past the usual buffed stats stuff.
---
Ah, so what you are suggesting is that ArenaNet code a new version of the package so that people in a single country in the world can also get them? Because the issue here is that it is a package in the gem store, therefore it is locked. The things dropping from mobs and story missions are not gem store items and therefore not paid while this one is basically a 100% discounted gem store item.
---
Unironically would dig GW1 mobile.
---
It is illogical that you don't feel apreciated as a customer because your government said that such apreciation is banned. They still apreciate you but can't show it off. You are crying on wrong grave.
---
&gt; There is absolutely nothing suspicious about that
---
Accepted.
---
Literally who gives a shit?  Tbh if anybody ever cares what gender somebody is they're automatically thirsty in my book
---
alacrity ren doesn't exactly remove the necessity of a chrono.  Hell if anything, SoI's make it so that renegade doesn't have to take full Diviner gear lololol
---
but yes, 10-man SoI is absolutely toxic to the raid meta lol
---
That depends on what you mean by everyday user. I spent about three hours buying and salvaging food to last me less than six months. I have three plots, so let's say the everyday user only has one plot; they'd spend probably an hour to prepare 6 months of compost in advance. Most of this is eaten up by the salvaging time.
---
An hour every six months doesn't sound like a lot, but it really is, especially if you spread it out. It would actually take much longer than an hour total over six months if you craft everything from scratch every day, but that's less to do with the salvaging and more all of the other stuff and travel times.
---
They are following the law of a country accept it.
---
fuck sake anet
---
To be fair unless he's making a living off of that work he doesn't owe anybody jack shit
---
&gt; centralized store for the cards, it's all user markets.
---
So the relevant part is who makes the money? Gabling is harmless as long as it's not a company making the profits, but some few individual traders? And yes, the market sets the price for things, which isn't necessarily what the company intended. doesn't change the fact, that adding a market after loot-boxes means that they actually can pay out real money.
---
And again, your argument is that adding the chance for a real money pay-out is a good thing that removes the bad side of gambling. Which is still complete nonsense.
---
&gt; I'm almost 100% certain I did not suggest making BLC lootbox cosmetics the center of a player market,
---
No, but you are claiming that gambling with TCGs is different and defending it there. That the double standard I mentioned earlier.
---
Its not discrimination what an idiotic phrase to use why shoild the rest of tje player base be denied something because the Beligian players can't get them grow up and stop acting so entitled.
---
Yeah, sucks that they don't give a shit about some random european country. Sounds sarcastic, but I mean it. It wouldn't kill them to throw them a non RNG bone, but obviously it's too much effort.
---
On a sidenote: I think it's fucking amazing that your country took the first step, and I can only hope that the rest of the EU can stop gargling corporate balls long enough to back you up.
---
Adding to that:
---
From 450-500 huntsman (and for a future weaponsmith/artificer)  I STRONGLY suggest making Mystic Curious if you can, (may need legendary crafting masteries) quickest, easiest and cheapest(I think I even made some profit): 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/74xugu/grandmaster_huntsmanweaponsmithartificer_leveling/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
You call these three customize Housing?
---
Thank you! I might have missed the provision master mastery when I checked this earlier. Is Dire an alternative for Trailblazer since I can't buy the recipe yet?
---
oh I see, so technically they could choose not to implement them at all.
---
I main Engineer and had similar problems starting off. Also I helped a friend recently who had similar problems.
---
You should at least be able to select a full line in the Holosmith specialisation before using it.
---
This will be:
---
Prismatic Converter,
---
Crystal Konfiguration: Eclipse,
---
Enhanced Capacity Storage Unit
---
Luckily for you, this is (at least in my opinion) the best configuration for Holosmith to run around in Open World anyway. After that Holosmith is playable.
---
You can easily complete Holosmith by unlocking all maps and farming the Hero Points within a day on the weekend (you will meet other players randomly on the hero points and beat them together), but I would recommend playing the story, if it is your first time and unlock all mounts.
---
Another really important thing is your gear.
---
You won't get Ascended Gear easily, but make at least sure you have a full exotic armor with Berserker stats (Power Precision Ferocity). You can buy that on Trading post.
---
Put Power, Precision, Ferocity, For Engineer, rarity exotic Level 80-80 (not lower!) In the filter on the Tradingpost (there is a gear symbol next to the search bar). Then you can sort by price and order the cheapest ones.
---
Also order a shield or pistol with the same exotic stats. You might also want to carry around a rifle with the same stats. Sometimes it's beneficial to have that rifle in your inventory, so you can switch to a ranged weapon when needed.
---
You will also need it for now, until you have the Holosmith Build playable.
---
You should already have a good sword, which you got when starting holosmith. Hopefully you selected Berserker stats...
---
If you need to get rid of you current armor, think about either salvaging it and selling the parts or throw 3 pieces each + a mystic forge stone and you will get back one piece you can sell on the TP (with a lot of luck it will even be be worth something...)
---
Then go into the PvP Lobby, go up to the Laurel Merchant and buy 
---
Crystalline Band,
---
Ring of Red Death,
---
Althea's Ashes,
---
Magister's Field Journal,
---
Mark of the Tethyos Houses.
---
If you don't have enough laurels... log in daily and wait for it?
---
Exotic Trinkets are quite cheap on the Tradingpost, I think...
---
But usually you should by now have enough laurels anyway for the Ascended Trinkets, which are 2x stronger.
---
There are cheaper/more efficient ways to get Ascended Trinkets, like doing Meta in Dragonfall and other Season 4 Maps or doing Starter Fractals in a group, but for you right now Laurels should at least provide half of the set or even a full set. 
---
If you need money, farm in silverwastes or use the LFG to search for a commander who is doing a bounty farm train in Crystal Oasis. (Or buy for gems... :/)
---
If you find a Silverwastes Farm train (look for SW or RIBA in LFG) you can do that. Holosmith + Flamethrower + Turret is great for tagging mobs.
---
You can also sell stuff from your crafting material storage for now and buy it back later if you really need it.
---
Take a look using gw2efficiency.com which of the materials in you material storage will bring lots of money.
---
As a start, you should probably read and follow this:
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Protection_Sword/Shield
---
Take the Inventions Variant instead of Firearms and select Mecha Legs instead of experimental turrets. Make sure to pack Thumper Turret instead of Elixir U. You can use the Thumper Turret to keep enemies on the ground and the toolbelt skill to quickly break stuns (that's a general recommendation).
---
This sacrifices a lot of damage output, but in my opinion the mecha legs add a lot of quality of live over constantly using the toolbelt skill from Elixir U to make you faster.
---
If you find a hard to beat enemy, you can swap Inventions back to firearms.
---
While fighting, stay in photon forge as long as possible.
---
This requires some skill. Don't get frustrated, skill will come to you after a while. Engineer depends a lot on player skill.
---
You will learn this.
---
Never overheat!
---
While in Photon Forge:
---
Use 2 to get to your enemy. Use 5 + Thumper Turret to stun your enemy and deal CC on bosses.
---
If you don't need to decrease distance never use 2.
---
If you don't need stun or CC never use 5.
---
Use 3 as often as possible while near your enemy.
---
Use 4 as often as possible if you are on medium range.
---
Never break the auto-attack chain on 1. You need to hit three times with 1, because only the third hit will deal a lot of damage.
---
When healing, always explode or pick up your turret immediately. If you do this, it's the best healing skill for you and your team.
---
I recommend the standard equipment recommended on Metabattle. It is the best one for experimenting with different builds.
---
Most importantly: Have Fun!
---
Running around with a flamethrower lighting up beetles is a great way to fight frustration.
---
250 on each map takes a bit of time, imagine doing it when completing that map and achievements. It is 1,5 years of content to go through, so don't feel bad to take your time. If you squeeze such amount of stuff into few days, it will suck.
---
Home instances have guaranteed, nodes, hearts, dailies on that maps. It accumulates if you actively play that content. 
---
Most players that actually ever played on those maps had currencies already so it was no deal. Only those who skipped playing all that content (usually while also shouting on forums that there is no content) had bad time not having it and needing it. New players have a lot to do, this is just another thing in long list of stuff to play , hundreds of hours of content. So be reasonable in your speed. It is better to go there once a day for a bit to play some meta events and dailies than farming it until your head hurts.
---
Never mind, but it is totally possible to implement even complex code or functionality and it be working right at the first place without testing. Or just the opposite. If something obvious in the game is not working as intended, you can take for granted it was either not tested, or they decided it was not necessary to be fixed before shipping. Both options are bad.
---
Oh stop acting like an entitled baby for god sakes "oh Anet are big bad monsters they are denying us a special present". Stop acting like Anet planned this and if Belgium didn't have these laws they would have still ignored them if you want to bitch and moan do it to your elected representative not a company following the law of a land.
---
Stop being an actual slave to min-maxing? Genuine suggestion here.
---
You can grind that lettuce to make simple salads, which will give you the low level salvage item.
---
Good troll
---
i cant even craft the composter despite being at that step... just doesnt show up and im lvl 490 lol
---
There is a really dark joke here about what his company did to people trying to buy his music.
---
i think you can tp the plants or mail them to your main account so you still get your plants without having to replant
---
Fk the charr.
---
The grind is here only because those people did not played on that maps on map release and later ever. If your choice of map to play is 100% by gold per hour, then you never accumulate currencies and then new release needing them gives you bad time. 
---
It is good to just go play on random maps from time to time, there are still good events and your arm would be fine if you done it. Imagine playing eahc map once per week for 10 minutes. You would have everything without single day of heart farm.
---
Staff? Metal mage (metalurgist?) like Magneto + some liquid metal etc.
---
I think we have plenty of metal staves that could be used for fashion wars too.
---
Because Arenanet still exists :P... if arenanet never make another game they will die and don't think for a second that NCsoft would keep a non profitable game running for the love of the western world.
---
They have sunset servers for less. 
---
I am not saying Anet are dying, I am just saying that anyone wishing for them to not make another game is asking for the company to die.
---
Oh ok, so "all" means "from all sources". Thank you!
---
what?
---
I can imagine someone put all nodes on top of each other and then just let bot accounts go in and AoE harvest infinitely.
---
It is probably your best pick for now indeed. You may need to compensate a bit with Runes/Sigils/Food/etc a bit while you are on Dire.
---
Also if  you do some fractals, PvP or WvW it could be better and easier to get some armor/weapons with the crafting Marks directly in ascended without having to pay the ~10 gold of Magumma Lilys for each Insignia or Inscriptions. Will also make you save quite a bit on a Linseed Oil. This can usually be applied to most/all HoT stats.
---
You could also check [Exotic equipment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trailblazer%27s#Exotic_equipment) that you can get in Trailblazer through events, achievements and map currency.
---
and then you realize that anet didn't invent the name balthazar
---
but why would anyone put them down in the instance? they stand around for only 5 minutes, right?
---
I am still feeling sad that PoF didn't feel like an Xpac to me. People keep saying "you get all this free content" but most of that is stuff that comes with any other game's core expansion, and then they get free content on top of that.
---
are more recipes going to be discovered or is this basically it?
---
Innocent unless proven guilty
---
The images came from data mining yesterday's patch.
---
Most of new weapon sets doesn't have a trident, a harpon, and neither a spear skin in them, so there are two options:
---
  
---
1. Anet will release all missing skins at once, and they didn't release them earlier to not spoil anything.
---
or
---
2. Those are just build template icons.
---
I really want to believe, that those icons are for elite specs, but unless Anet wants to surpsize us, it's somehow counter-productive to release elite specs using underwater weapons on land, where skins for said weapons weren't released in a pretty long time. 
---
We all know the second name for the game is Fashion Wars 2
---
Trading post timeouts might be because thousands of people actually went and were buying things. 
---
Also, go change maps sometimes, especially if you salvage. It helps to reduce the lag.
---
You're really not expected to gain a significant amount of keys outside of the gemstore - they're a bonus. Not sure why you'd compare them to any rng drops from regular gameplay.
---
This. Sorry bro, but your account was, almost without doubt, compromised. Arenanet doesn’t delete inactive characters.
---
RIP Wildstar. You were the better WoW.
---
If you have salvaging lags, it is because of the endless "queue" of items you got (on right side of screen, the scrolling items). Helps to change map or just go through loading screen in general to flush those out. Also helps with trading post after you salvaged a bit.
---
Bully elite slec, coming soon
---
Sadly, I must agree. Chances that those are build template icons are pretty much higher.
---
Untill I hear what those icons are for from devs, it can be for elite specs as well. 
---
Call it Shroedinger's hype.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You're not the only one.
---
Yeah there are ways to reduce the stress but even pacing yourself and enjoying the maps it takes a long time.
---
I'm personally not a fan of PvE and just came back to the game last week after a break, I play WvW 90% of the time so I chose to get the Skyscale the quickest way. 
---
Doing it the way I am makes the grind much more obvious compared to spreading it out but either way you do it will take a significant amount of time.
---
I've looted at least 30 herb nodes on my non-cook and have got nothing
---
Basically, yes. Collection gives you 50 free cooking skill levels and unlocks gardening plot and bank and cooking station in your home instance, though, so it is pretty much worth it.
---
that reminds me of this post:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cr61th/psa_check_your_accounts_for_free_glyphs_of_alchemy/
---
It really won't though... the implications behind the creation of a piece of art affect the way you perceive it...
---
That's something some of us still hope for.
---
But there is the thing - for a while, when new skin sets were released, they didn't include underwater weapons.
---
So either Anet is making elite specs with underwater weapons on land, and release all missing skins at once, or those are just build template icons.
---
There is also a possibility, that they will not release missing skins, and release elite specs with those weapons still, or giving an option to apply staff and rifle skins onto trident, spear, and harpoon gun.
---
I know Anet intend us to go to the aerodrome, but in reality everyone preclears at VG, Sloth, W7 and waits at the Boss till the last late guy arrives. Noone wants to go out aggain then
---
The way I been getting them kinda fast is in wvw, there's that track for legendary weapon stuff it gives them out every now and then. I don't know if it's the fastest though
---
i remember that post. if only they gave him some glyphs of the crucible, too
---
If you play WvW that much, just do reward tracks and get all the currencies while playing WvW. Should be more enjoyable. Maybe not that fast, but should work.
---
There will be short drama if true and most people wont care long term.
---
They work in WvW
---
Same for me, if Elementalist was given trident to use on land. 
---
I would scream like a 10yo in Epstein's dungeon.
---
Lmao aerodrome bout to be lookin like an all you can eat buffet
---
* Reward tracks in PvP/WvW
---
* daily logins -&gt; last chest
---
* fractals have vendor for few a day 
---
* mystic forge if you have resources
---
Dies anyone have a gem cost breakdown for this package? Not sure if the value is worth it compared to just waiting for individual purchases/sales.
---
soo if you switch specs from condi to power on one character for example and therefor need different food you now have to leave the instance?
---
nice!
---
Absolutely. Gw1 is pretty suited for mobile anyhow since point and click movement always has been a thing there.. i know im in the minority but id love a gw1 mobile version.

now this is quality lgbt

finally a reason to support that community

You can, but delay until stuff is added to voucher list is very substantial. If anything, you'd farm it about 10 times over if not 50 until they'll add the new stuff there, tbh.
---
Maybe in popular culture, but his music will have that black mark forever.
---
lol its a good joke
---
&gt;You are not supposed to make your own judgements. Thats what I was after.
---
That is one incredibly ignorant hill to die on
---
In hindsight, that's absolutely the route I'd have gone with.
---
I'm actually using one of the tracks to reduce the pain for the difluorite crystals. Sadly I underestimated how bad it was going to be so I didn't start the reward track until a few days ago.
---
At this point I'm committed to getting it done as fast as possible.
---
&gt;You're really not expected to gain a significant amount of keys outside of the gemstore
---
Not sure how it's related to what I wrote, do you mean it in the sense "it doesn't count because it's not frequent"?
---
&gt; Not sure why you'd compare them to any rng drops from regular gameplay.
---
Because you wrote:
---
&gt;Free gambling is still gambling though.
---
And that in essence, a BLC is a rng box. What subjects it to the gambling regulation is that you can pay for it with real money.
---
If that is true it‘s hilarious! Do you really not get exp from them anymore?
---
The fastest is mystic forge.
---
cheapest is reward tracks
---
You could argue that it's still somewhat relevant because there are still people out there to this day who have not received their copy of the GW2 original soundtrack lololol
---
&gt; you can get them in story missions.
---
So? The gemshop ones are still banned in Belgium and that's what it's about. 
---
Even a free lootbox from the gemshop is still a lootbox from the gemshop. By distributing some free poker chips for your casino you still invite them to gamble.
---
&gt; if it was true, all loot bags (eg: champion's) and boxes would be considered "lootboxes".
---
That's not the definition fo "lootbox". 
---
Champion bags etc. are rng, yes, but you aren't able to buy them for RL money. The word "Lootbox" is used for rng boxes that can be bought for RL money. 
---
You spend money for a chest with random stuff inside -&gt; gambling. And it's still this, no matter if you are able to rarely get a key ingame or once a week via story. You are (mainly) able to get them for RL money, that's the point.
---
However, the "invite to gamble" point I mentioned probably is the reason they blocked the free one as well. No matter if it's "technically allowed", one charge and they get some annoying trouble, even if they win. Unnecessary trouble.
---
RNG in the game is still homophobic.
---
I know, but Blegium's gambling ban is all about the gemstore/RL transactions. Not about ingame loot.
---
Him not delivering on paid customers and making dubious metaphors already put him off that kind of deal.
---
Negative percent
---
Huh... interesting...
---
This is a Chris Brown test comment.
---
They said that about Season 1..
---
I have to agree. Ranger being able to match, if not completely do better than deadeye really irks me.
---
They last 5 minutes on the ground. They could very well dissappear in the Aerodrome itself if you have a bad d/c, so that makes no sense to me.
---
What makes more sense to me is that raid instances are flagged with items that you can or can't use while being inside and that they probably forgot to update the list with these feasts
---
Raids are competitive??? Against the AI?
---
Pff, no. 
---
That 'reputation' is exactly what they meant
---
That reputation needs to not exist. Can't play a god damn dungeon or low tier fractal without some elite Player flashing their big dps c*ck and crying like a baby because they can't move an inche unless others do the same amount. 
---
Meanwhile my Guild mates and I laugh and have fun learning mechanics and chilling. We do the same shit as 'elites' but we sleep good at nights even if one of the more intense content screws us over. 
---
The minute we lfg and get a randomn 'elite' our nights become sour. 
---
That 'reputation',  needs to be undone. 
---
Saying they won't stay is not something you should use a defense, it only makes the first point more solid. 
---
'Casuals' want to do the 'elite' things, but you know why they don't?  Cause most of them are still new or simply don't have the time to learn mechanics fast enough to do it. They'll come around, slowly but surely. The same person who said it's 'too demanding for me; -; ' 
---
They coming back in a year or two with more confidence. The same casuals you all saying would leave the game, they still gonna be here in two, three years. 
---
People saying just leave the game have a point though. Why you complaining on reddit when you can just pay subscriptions on a new game with more fun?  You already just had to pay once on gw2 and you milked about 7 years of content from it, move on then (?)
---
Like really, I've been seeing all this rant for content, just make your point and leave so anet will see stats and feel the burn and fix their shit for the future players.
---
No, the stupid part about this update is that utilities duration hasnt been touched at all
---
After obtaining the seeds you progress in the collection the donate them to the npc it gives no step in the collection but onlocks the recepie

By that logic thr entire game is gambling because you kill enemies and they drop random loot.

Maybe don't compare a company being bad at seeling its products with a person raping another?
---
When you see the red laser, you have to dodge immediately?
---
yeah, i was using the wiki pages for the glyphs. crucible doesn't have a table for plants, so i just used the one for alchemy to see what drops plants that also have seeds. seems only t2 converts into peppercorn, though.
---
That’s because it’s not at PAX. It’s before it.
---
I wouldn't claim to know so much about the law like you do. 
---
But I don't think such statements are actually legally relevant:
---
&gt;I'd consider a free lottery ticket still to be gambling  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Just 'cause you get a freeby once a while doesn't change the purpose of said item.
---
In fact, if you look at [the statement from the Belgian gambling commission](https://www.koengeens.be/news/2018/04/25/loot-boxen-in-drie-videogames-in-strijd-met-kansspelwetgeving), you see that the fact that you purchase them for money is at the core of the idea.
---
Please, we just had a very hard three days of telling players not to be entitled brats. Could we maybe have a break?
---
The situation that momoa described is EXACTLY what's happened with many prospective players i've met over my time of playing who were put off by the concept of raiding.  Make no mistake: Raiding absolutely has an "acquired taste" of a reputation, and it directly affects the size of the raiding community (which is already so miniscule to begin with).
---
Yes please! I always found it odd that an important group in elonia were the sunSPEARS but no one can wield a spear on land.
---
Kourna is easy. Do the heart at the west shore. Collect all bottles, relog to a different character, collect all bottles. If you collect every bottle twice with each character and then hand them in the heart will be completed.
---
&gt; ignoring the reason why it flopped was because of shitty rewards. 
---
I'm glad you brought that up actually.  I feel like the major reason why so much of the content in this game is deprecated is because of the lack of satisfying rewards.  It feels like Arenanet just doesn't like satisfying their players who actually care to put effort into the game.  Or they just actually don't know how to make rewards feel satisfying.

So you want them to make an already easy and fast af farm that gives ascended accessories even easier?
---
Have you considered that that CC is the price to pay for almost free ascended accessories. 
---
Gathering Winterberries could be easier, but it shouldn’t be. What is wrong with having to fight your way to get those precious berries.
---
I'm just going to step in and correct you a bit there: " Arenanet let the JP incident sit for a day and no official statement"  
---
The "incident" happened on July 4th, i.e. national-wide holiday in the USA. There was literally no one to respond at the office that day.
---
While I agree with you and would personally never buy the chest keys, I needed to put a price on them. They cost 125 gems, but they’re probably not worth 125 gems. I see your point but for the sake of consistency I used the 125 gems to be able to draw up the value from the drops.
---
Wow more lootboxes how fun
---
It really makes sense, but I'd like to queue them for the next 7 Days. Maybe they could copy the UI from the Assembly Device from Guild Hall for each spot.

1 LI/LD for the complete wing clear would be nice. That way you could get slowly invested in the legendary items while trainning with cheesy mechanics preparing to later try the normal mode.
---
I mean I agree with you, I'm just explaining why people care about these things.
---
Oh damn, I competely missed that you get the bonds and ocean weapons regardless of your choice. I wish arena net wrote the description more clearly, thanks for the heads up!
---
Yes you can do that too but you will end up with a lot of extra, if cook coffee/bowl of elon red, u can sal them later using [Portable Composter](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Portable_Composter).

---
Now that they made recipe sheets account-wide, what's left is levels and discovered recipes, and being able to use all 9 disciplines without having to talk to crafting masters to change the learned disciplines.  
---
Since there's the crafting licenses (currently accounts can purchase 2, for a total of 4 disciplines per character active at the same time), they would become meaningless if they made crafting truly account-wide, so they would also have to create some other use for crafting licenses before they could make it account-wide, since I doubt they'll want to make gem refunds.
---
Ah yes, cause every joke in the universe has to be true because otherwise it’s not funny.
---
Very true, I was just making the point that OP shouldn’t make the focus of their argument based solely on the timing of responses.
---
On top of that JP used the holiday as an excuse to attack and insult the community. “Entitlement to my fucking time.” As she put it.
---
People can think what they want on Internet personalities and companies, I just want to make the point that “it took a day.” Is a weak stance to take.

doesn't that describe how dozens of existing collections already work?

Okay, Off-Topic question here. You have all three plots and I have seen that it was announced AND the wiki says it is available since yesterday yet I can't find the third plot in the Gem store... so, where is the damn thing?
---
Of course not. There's also irony.
---
But that's not irony. That's simply something that cannot happen. 
---
OP took the time to photoshop a bloodstone dust where it cannot exist, when it would have been more fun to show an inventory full of bloodstone dust stacks next to the TP panel with the food. By the same principle that makes the stoning scene in Monty Python life of Brian so funny because of the exxagerated number of rocks and the huge boulder at the end.

2v2 maps are accesible only through custom games, person out of the loop would have no idea those exist unless they go through custom games list. There is literally no point of releasing more 2v2 maps as they are hardly used anyway. And if somebody wants to do a couple 2v2 skirmishes with friends they will probably use normal 5v5 maps because nobody cares about fancy mechanics and 5v5 maps are better known and provide larger sparring areas and it's easier for people to swap places/teams are they can hold more people. Designing 2v2 map just for the sake of releasing anything is stupid and the devs who had to design and implement the map could have worked on something more meaningful for the community, like more 5v5 maps (as it's the only mode that has an active queue), or actual 2v2 queue and leaderboard.
---
Yeah well ok, but can't you just IMAGINE it not working. Picture yourself standing in a keep and you can't put your feast down. Doesn't that make you FURIOUS at Anet
---
Malice is a resource they generate by hitting you with their other skills. Each skill generates 1 malice, and 1 additional malice if they crit. And the telegraph is a big orange/red laser with a very loud and obnoxious sound effect. When that happens, dodge, block, pop an invuln, whatever youve got available.
---
See? That's pure pride. Who goes around saying how smart they are?
---
Eh, Three Round Burst does such shit damage that you really cant kill anyone with it. The optimal version is just spamming skirmishers shot and hoping to hit a DJ.
---
3, at most. Even those 3 only work if they have not used any initiative at all, in which case they sure as hell havent been trying to kill you, so you dont have to do anything.
---
Never tought of doing that! Is it like a really better chance to get better stuff? Sorry if dumb question
---
You can still get them buy key farming, or as rare drops if that even happens anymore. I don't really see what the difference is as that's completely free too.
---
Gefeliciteerd! Je bent nog achterlijker dan een broodje pindakaas :/
---
And make sure the corresponding filters like Ascended and Master are ticked in the cook crafting station.
---
When you lie on the resume but still get the underwater mount job.
---
That does not affect the speed of crafting, salvaging, or opening bags. The items will just appear later in the item reel, no matter how fast you do it.
---
The item reel may slow down your FPS in some cases, tho.
---
Everyone think it's amazing but people still buy keys :/
---
TYVM!!!!! Excellent, succinct guide mate! Have an upvote sir.
---
*yes*!
---
thats so a massiv oversight lul but no wonder since anet doesnt play their won game
---
Yeah because they're by far the ones with the best design in every part of the game. And they rule. They should definitely take back their Ascalon.
---
They get smarter in groups, right? So, will we get a WvW bonus when the whole squad is Skritt? :)
---
WAIT WHY IS THE NECK THE JIGGLY PART, OF ALL PLACES
---
I would absolutely love housing, I almost started playing ESO just for the housing feature (and the Skyrim nostalgia - unfortunately it's just literally got those 2 things going for it and nothing else) and it's been my #1 dream feature for both WoW (when I played it) and GW2 for ages. As has been mentioned it was the standout feature of Wildstar and a huge reason why people are still mourning that game despite it never really getting off the ground.
---
I get the worries that it would lead to people just spending time in their houses  but I think that severely underestimates the draw it could have on doing content out in the world in order to collect things to PUT in our houses. Furniture and decorations from achievements and map currency vendors, from gold (which means gold farming which you can't do in your home), trophies for trophy cases or displays from defeating world/raid/fractal bosses, PVP/WVW trophies, plus if you keep the system of being able to visit as you can with home instances you also have people engaging with each other by visiting each other. More ideas: maps you can put on your walls from exploration, get paintings from viewing vistas, make scribing a mainstream crafting skill for furniture, maybe even throw in some items for other professions to make. 
---
Not to mention I think they should keep home instances as the default starter housing, and then doing proper housing as an endgame feature which would be akin to a legendary weapon in terms of effort/gold/time to achieve (ideally I'd say there should be tiered options so smaller houses for less effort/gold/time). 
---
Basically the possibilities are endless and it would just add more reasons for people to spend time out in the world doing all sorts of content and making gold and keeping the world alive. Just don't add poker tables or something to the homes and it'll be fine (Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates players know what I'm talking about).
---
&gt; Eh, crazy internet people
---
The crazy internet person is the one who seems obsessed with the "real gender" of someone they've never met online
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuZ0znvhyeE
---
So, I can't decide what class to play. In other MMOs, I typically enjoy fast-paced melee classes that have a bit of versatility to their kit and are constantly active, and use some kind of magic or something -- Shaman from WoW, Medic from Wildstar, Monk from WoW (Fistweaving), Druid from WoW, Chloro / Cleric from RIFT, etc.
---
I also enjoy having RNG and dynamic rotations/playstyles, as opposed to static ones.
---
... what class would fit for me?
---
I mean, you could take shortbow offhand, but then you give up on cleave or the ability to fight up close at all. Which means youre even more of a sitting duck. Plus, the whole "no initiative to run away if youre trying to kill someone" problem remains. And no, S/P cant juke, and D/P cant spam stealth if theyre low on initiative (not to mention that D/P stealth is so slow the enemy wouldve killed you two times over by the time you tried to). And Shadowstep has looooong not been a complete disengage. Most roamers can match it with ease.
---
lol just traits.
---
It's perfectly okay to be boring, just don't drag me down with you.
---
Trident, Spear-gun, Scepter, Pistol, Mace, Spear, Focus.
---
Seeing those underwater weapons suggests we can look forward to being able to use them on land, at least for the new Elite specs.
---
They are the ones missing from https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elite_specialization_equipment , so it could also just be a bit of future-proofing.
---
It's not though. It has no negative or positive aspersions towards the gender. It simply states that one gender can easily ruin another's life in our current society. Now that might be wrong, but it's not sexist. 
---
It's like saying, men can more easily get a job in construction. The statement itself is not sexist.
---
I like how the majority of your comment is dedicated to being toxic, even though you could have excluded it and simply made a point that contributed to the conversation.
---
Nice ty.
---
yeah stating a fact is not sexist, stating a lie based on prejudice and stereotyping is, i hope you can see the difference. if you think what you said is "general knowledge, fact" then i pity you
---
Against other raid groups. Record runs exist
---
Asuras are the funniest, I'd say Charr for second place (mostly based off of the one voice line in Thunderhead Peaks when you're doing the inspirational speeches and mention a book club to the charr group, and one of them deadpans ".... What's a book club?" which has me chuckling every time I hear it - just perfect line delivery by that voice actor). Sylvari are strong contenders too, I'd say norn 4th and humans last probably. 
---
If we're adding non-playable races then it's skritt in first place, quaggans in second, then choya (you wouldn't think a non-verbal race would be so funny but you'd be wrong).
---
the only decent boost are wxp and karma. rest is garbage
---
OMFG LMAO. What an oversight. IS this just a bug or did they just not allow it?
---
Thank you!
---
This works very well. I checked my new name and it wasn't used by anyone. Thanks.
---
Still, this isn't the point of the game mode. Only a few players do that.
---
The thing you said about building up over time is something i feel a lot of players miss out on. Piling them up over time is the very best thing to do. Then you never really run out of them and don't have to gamble in the mystic forge for a large amount of gold.
---
Won't help that person now but something more players should think about. Planning ahead in this game is making your gaming life so much easier.
---
sorry but thats not an option since i consider myself a toxic elitist
---
/s
---
What is the future of legendary crafting? Is Exordium the final legendary weapon ?
---
I mean if you are unable to spend initiative on stealth for D/P or juke for S/P, you wouldn't be able to spend them on attacking in those sets anyway unless you are only swapping to them for auto cleave.
---
As for Shadowstep not being enough, I guess SlB or Mirage can catch it still, if its not covered with Stealth after use that is. Though by using the chain skill it can still be used for juke for most cases I guess. If that is not enough, I guess Shadow Portal can be used in its place before engaging in a safe place, and for that I think we can agree there is nothing an enemy can do about it.
---
 Also, I don't think there is a point to argue how a Thief should manage their initiative to use the defense/mobility available to them. The point was I believe that they were there, not that its hard to manage class resources to use them.
---
By far not even close to being enough to make it "dreadful times to be a succesful white male"

On berserker your mace burst skill changes from being a 3sec stun to a 1sec daze. That's a huge decrease in breakbar damage, and being able to break Samarog quickly is absolutely necessary to beat her effectively.

---
you telling me our thicc boi is an her??? 
---
fair point, but last week when i played core warrior i didnt event get to use all my cc cause the breakbar was gone instantly, soooooo whats the point of overstacking cc
---
and even if it made a few seconds of difference, would that be enough to accept a 7k dps loss?
---
How about actual content and not something that's only gonna exist as a gold/item sink? You know, like dungeons, raids, world bosses, new zones, an expansion, WvW changes, fractals, etc.
---
Cooldown on core warri mace F1 is so short that you can use 2 of them in a CC phase if your squad has very bad CC. This would make it a superior CC option in PUGs I guess. Same for Sloth.
---
yea my thoughtprocess was similar, i normaly take wild blow additionaly to headbutt+option of mm, i dont see how cc as bers is inferior to core unless overall cc is absolute miserable in group
---
Well admittedly I don't know enough about DE playstyle to argue any further, its just that what I know from regular Thief to extrapolate on what DE can have. If you are a DE main and say that the playstyle doesn't allow for usage of mobility and defense, I will take your word for it. Kind of explains why Core is much more popularly used too.
---
I always feel bit strange when explaining to new players where to find the LFG options..
---
If you endlessly respawned every 5 minutes to be gutted by some random passerby you would also consider ending it on your own terms.
---
Good point, I guess. I play condi zerker and Headbutt is a big part of the rotation for upkeeping berserk mode. Perhaps saving it for breakbars decreases zerker dps dramatically or dramatically reduces the uptime on berserk mode. Idk.
---
first anet need to change their policy about their current approach with gw2 since PoF and turning this game into a solo game where almost no contest exist with requires effort and players working together in guilds/communitys
---
Yup. Core is considerably better, both because its damage isnt frontloaded into just one easily avoidable attack, but also because its free to use its initiative for mobility and utility/defenses, instead of having to dump it into low damage skills just to build up malice.
---
well this is certainly the first time i heard of it, gonna check "her" out tonight if i see certain indications if you know what i mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yeah, but in terms of speed, gold can be sped up with gems to cash.
---
You can't gem to karma or spirit shards.
---
doesnt that apply to core as well though? your dps is going to shit anyways when you are on mm. right?
---
Wouldnt you have to level cooking on your alt first? It's gonna take quite a few seeds to make you break even.

It really is frustrating how complicated the good/bad divide is with Ascalonian politics at the time. I feel like Barradin would have made an excellent king, but even he was in support of Adelbern. He even has us [make sure everyone is loyal to Adelbern](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Opposition_to_the_King).
---
Obviously, Adelbern proved to be less than ideal for Ascalon.
---
But then again, Rurik proved himself to be what could have been an incredible king to the Ascalonians, wherever they were. It's absolutely tragic to all of history that Rurik was killed during the voyage to Kryta.
---
Althea also, no doubt, would have been a great queen. Unfortunately, while we were so close to having a solid pair on the throne, everything went wrong.
---
But to really support your point: Rurik could have easily decided to give into his father's rage upon Althea's death. Instead, he decided to preserve those still alive and move on from Ascalon. He has a much better heart than his father did.
---
It can be done aye, just hope that if they do it they’ll give is a proper UI for it too.
---
there's a staff build that you wouldn't expect:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKXe8S1GZm0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKXe8S1GZm0)

---
Of course they are not. Why do you say that?
---
i don't think an alt account would need cooking to be able to harvest and sell the herbs or send them to your main which does have cooking. but i won't know for sure until tomorrow.
---
I agree.  One of the things I don't like playing with a controller is when its on the TV I tend to be in my bed room using it with steam link so I can't really read the UI very well so if they did overhaul it like Elder Scrolls Online did that would be awesome.  ESO has a really nice UI for controller mode VS keyboard mouse mode.  Something similar to that would go along way if they did add it.

Working on it now. A couple of the heart quests in each zone are really easy so they are worth doing. I'd also recommend giving the dailies a try as some are trivial (but hot hugely rewarding).

Sandswept, Kourkna and Jahai are all fairly doable if you do the meta events and a few hearts.

Dragonfall and Istan are really generous if you do the metas to the point that they're the least effort to complete by far.
---
WvW and PvP reward tracks provide a decent amount. 
---
Lastly, you can buy them directly for volatile magic in Dragonfall.
---
You don't get the luxury of running Outrage unless you're playing a DPS warrior, not a BS. With BS it's 100% better to take Signet of Might over Headbutt+Outrage combo, and avoid using Headbutt entirely, saving it just for the opener and CCs.
---
At last, the underwater expansion we've all been asking for.
---
Elaborate what you mean by "fitting", im clearly missing something here.
---
It reminds me of a splash background for an elite specialization, such as one for Necromancer with the greens and black colors. Though I don't ever recall seeing those in-game so it could be something else.
---
It looks like the bar crossing the bottom is for text. Maybe it's something we'll be able to see in-game as some sort of advertisement for upcoming content.
---
Seems like a normal PvP game to me.
---
No, but when you show up with an allegation and not any evidence it doesn’t help. If she has evidence I genuinely hope she takes his ass to court and gets him locked up, until then he’s innocent.
---
I don't think we've had any clarification on the issue. I've seen a few threads on the official forums but none of them have had an answer one way or the other.
---
That was it, thanks! I didn't even notice that the meat was an ingredient and had been put in my bank.
---
why tho
---
they are grown in your instance with seeds obtained by rng via any plant node with 'herb' in it(ex: young herb, mature herb, verdant herb)
---
And what do suggest we do if there isn’t enough evidence to prosecute?
---
I could see it being about Jormag or maybe his champion Drakkar being underwater and infused with some of Mordremoth and Zhaitan's magics like what we saw in Bitterfrost Frontier.
---
Or a warrior with that uses a trident. Imagine a Daredevil while using fire/earth/water/air magic.
---
It's not being toxic, it's just a tongue in cheek comment that's pretty realistic. ANet has done dumb stuff in the past and I am genuinely scared they'll do it again.
---
None of these rewards have been returned yet. I'd expect them to be added to wardrobe unlockers at some point for people who did miss them.
---
Since its basically the only new reward for these events, they shouldnt return at all.
---
it's fitting it can't be used in the area it's intended for, in true anet fashion
---
In limited quantities though :(
---
Wings 1-3 had good release schedules. An anet raid dev said they were capable of 6 wings per year as a maximum. Now, any rational thinker obviously wasn't actually expecting 6 wings per year but they also weren't expecting it to end up as 1 wing per year either. Your "TWO WHOLE MONTHS!!!" is unfortunately far from the full story.
---
That's not true unless you're including the CC from head butt, but then you're ignoring the chance to take rampage.
---
They should make new tonics if the same event returns.
---
Just like the updated wvw reward structure, desert bl, the link system, how they are designing alliances, ...
---
People who use the term "reee" to mock others tend to have a lot more experience using the term then the people they're trying to mock.
---
You could see his toxic didn't work well.
---
&gt;MediaWiki
---
I hear ya. Thing is, there *used* *to be one*, "GW2Wiki", which was by no means excellent, but it worked! Then allasudden it just stopped working. Now I can no longer find it in Google Play Store.
---
Common clothing Outfit

I do water content sometimes just to show off my shark stick for sure.  Wish it was more relevant to main content, but it's still fun

---
Wildstar was a failed experiment in trying to cater to "hardcore" players.
---
It probably has something to do with the coding in the gem store, that it still counts as a transaction even though there is no cost. I wish they would just mail everyone who logged in the free item or made a different listing in the gem store that wasn't linked to the same one where you actually purchase items.
---
I got mine from 400-425 by making Chocolate omnomberry frosting, which then i sold at a profit, after that just following the Cooking achievements got me to 500 by chance.
---
...may I see it?
---
&gt; Am i overlooking smth?
---
Golem doesn't go invulnerable every 5 seconds in addition to half an hour of invulnerability twice in the fight.
---
Core bench is 9k higher than DH on Samarog if that helps. ;)
---
Hm? Quite sure they haven't had [Celebration Hat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celebration_Hat) obtainable since release, and while [Dragon Emblem Clothing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_Emblem_Clothing_Outfit) has been made available a bit now and then it is in no way available in any large quantity. 
---
[Toymaker's bag](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Toymaker%27s_Bag) is also unavailable (although a rather similar one is available through reward tracks.)
---
So while they do in general tend to avoid one off rewards they DO exist.
---
no need to be so rude, I don't see anywhere OP asking Reddit to fix it, isn't it a good to know thing?
---
Wait, so the reason we could only buy 2 black lion garden plots was so we could earn the third in game? That's kinda cool (by modern MMO standards, anyway).
---
well, I did find a github repository [here](https://github.com/Felixomni/gw2wiki-android) but this wasn't updated in like 7 years. The Maintainer also has 1 contribution in 2018 and a few others in 2014 and nothing else, So, I would think the project is dead.
---
However, I would try to reach out to contributors, mods or admins on the wiki and ask for this to be enabled.

Because I'm pretty sure the common clothing outfit isn't covered in solidifed magma.
---
You expect right. Anet has let us down far too long.
---
it seems that a few ppl didnt get the joke.
---
how unfortunate.
---
Its probably because feast items are usually made by combining 10 of the normal meal, which is kind of a nice touch even if some feasts are crafted outright and not combined.
---
Actually, it is. On charr specifically, it allows the infusion to cover the entire body. Wiki it.
---
weirdly enough, this version uses the https prefix and causes a certificate error for me from firefox, but other one is just [guildwars2.waveofshadow.com](https://guildwars2.waveofshadow.com) and doesnt trigger it.

So what actual, explicitly stated "dumb stuff" scares you into thinking they will make elite specs for underwater only?

I cannot imagine you being stupid enough to make a claim like this without providing support for it. Well, I can and you did, but I don't want to believe it. ^it's^not^being^toxic

Can someone confirm whether gathering the Cultivated Seeds is linked to the region you're in ?  
---
If it is, the repartition I got was :
---
* Sesame in Krytan regions
---
* Mint in Ascalonian regions
---
* Peppercorn in Shiverpeak regions
---
* Cloves in Maguuma regions
---
* Cilantro in Orrian regions
---
Got them from Mature Herbs mostly, unsure whether other herbs give them.
---
I wish the rest of the world would adopt what Belgium is doing. You should be thanking your country for not allowing you to waste money on virtual gambling, however it may be skinned. If we all followed your countries example, guild wars 2 would probably have more in game obtainable cosmetic rewards. Please don't shame something the rest of the world actually does want.
---
He pretends that he is just role playing rUdE aSuRa but he is just not a nice person.
---
Did people already get their rewards? I did participate in the event but I haven't got anything yet.
---
You should post in an another subreddit. Gw2 guilds or something...
---
I didn’t know there was another one for raiding
---
Can we salvage Halloween Food tho??
---
I mean i tried it with the Lunar food and well i couldn't......
---
/r/guildrecruitment
---
Because op said they "flash up". Which implies "appear" to me. In which case this could be an issue where the platform that wins is first in the code and its location is randomly set, and then the other platform is placed. Causing a delay between when the two assets load and divulging unintended information.
---
The Charr were the original inhabitants of Ascalon though. Humans drove them out. The Charr and Humans were at war because the Charr rightfully wanted Ascalon back.
---
You can stealth and capture the HP. Until the Avatar is in combat the fire under HP doesnt hit.
---
the blueish background looks like water with ripples in it!
---
It might be intended. I don't believe normal feasts can be placed either, to avoid trolling an instance where interacting with an objective or obscuring a point might be bad.
---
Wiki says it's cilantro for salsa. First thing I thought of was avocado for guacamole. Either way, now I'm hungry for Mexican food.
---
While banners seem to be bugged currently to stay permanently when placed, feasts only last for five minutes in the open world, so you won't see a ton of them scattered around.
---
GW1 Spiteful Spirit is my "Yeah, keep attacking, bitches" spell.
---
I wish suns refuge was a home instance, or we had personal instances across every expansion such as the egg chamber in HoT, and possibly a hidden chamber within Kesho for PoF, which could harness all our unlocked nodes etc within.
---
wait, we can get plots that arent in the gem store? wait how do u do this i totally missed this
---
interesting, never caught this clip
---
Thanks for the speedy responses 😃. Is the PvP fairly balanced?
---
Berserker cc is less reliable than core cc. You will notice once you try to kill qadim.
---
But you definitely don't need core at Sama. Play berserker if you prefer it like 95% of the player I see do it.
---
There is a Lasermarker which tell the direction.
---
And there is a anoying sound like "Deeeeeeeee".
---
Optic is not the only signal which tell: dj is coming.
---
Just sayn.
---
Just started playing GW2 again after about 4 years out of the game. It appears much has changed, and lots is new. Anyone kind enough to fill me in what's the biggest/new things to do since 2014/15?
---
Right now I'm a little lost in what to do/where to go with little money!
---
I think you're mixing up two things. The Guild Wars were a historical event in the lore, that's a fact. But how did you come up with the conclusion that this is the full explanation of the game's title? Futhermore, I find it fully justified that people expect that an online game called "Guild Wars 2" will have a significant amount of guild-related content, especially after seeing how guilds worked in the prequel.
---
This makes the most sense. At the very least let us craft some kind of asuran golem called a  Semi-automatic Horticulture Organic Vehicle : EL 2000 that will sit in our garden and hold up to 5 seeds and plant/pick things for us.
---
limit to 1 egg per character per day, 5 eggs per account per day
---
For who?  I only see a Skyscale in this photo......
---
I guess, somehow, idk.
---
But it's pretty barren. Especially at high end.
---
Btw, there's also WvW.
---
As for general PvP/WvW community, i think a lot of it hangs on what ANet says on 30th.
---
&gt; Is it worth getting the Deluxe (Or even Ultimate?) version of Path of Fire? (For the max level boost and additional character slot, I suppose)
---
you get the max level boost regardless of which version of PoF you buy. Other than that, the stuff that comes with the deluxe/ultimate edition are nice, but they're not absolutely game changing. The big thing that comes with the ultimate/deluxe editions is the [lily of the elon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lily_of_the_Elon#Guild_services) which is a lounge area that you can teleport to that contains all the standard services you'd expect to see in Lion's arch (crafting, trading post, mystic forge, etc) plus some more, in a smaller enclosed area. Again, not super necessary, but it's a nice little feature. You can only get this trough buying these versions, but you can get other similar lounge passes on the gem store if you choose not to do so now.
---
&gt; It doesn't look like there's any other versions of Heart of Thorns other than Standard anymore, is this right?
---
I believe so, yes
---
&gt; When I'm in the check-out section of the store I'm prompted to add "Living World Season 2 Complete Pack" to the purchase. What value does this additional purchase add to the experience?
---
the living world seasons are the stories between big expansions. They're effectively like expansion-lite dlc packs, which contain new maps, new gear, new masteries (like new mounts) and continues the story in between expansion. season 3 is between HoT and PoF, and season 4 is after PoF and leading into season 5 (which we'll hear more about on Friday)
---
Season 2 came before HoT, and it's important if you're really invested in the lore of the game, but other than that it brings the least to the game realistically since it doesn't have any maps locked behind it.
---
i am not playing it, but simply more content patches.  
---
gw2 is as slow as a snail apart from story every few months (beaten in ~2h + a few h achievements if you are someone who does that).  
---
if you search a game where you can watch netflix and press 1 in openworld meanwhile to kill some worldboss, gw2 is for you tho. easy loot simulator.  
---
there is a lot of content tho for someone new, depending on how much you play, you can get another two years out of gw2.
---
&gt; I'd tell you to play the F2P version for as long as you need to understand if you want to keep playing or not. 
---
He doesn't need the F2P version, he's got the basegame.
---
prince Rurik! Prince Rurik!....

&gt; It didn't occur to you that when you're asking a question and receiving an answer that didn't answer what you were really asking, maybe you weren't asking it properly?

&gt;Either way, get fucked, welcome to my block zone.
---
Your skin is about as thin as your cortex.
---
Even if you ignore that some players are still waiting for their Soundtrack to be delivered to them to this day, when they ordered it around the release of GW2 - How does someone who compares pirating music with the holocaust have a good reputation in the first place
---
F2P = basegame, right?
---
Or by buying the basegame when it wasn't F2P he also got both expansions guaranteed?
---
From my research, Glyph of the Crucible has the following effects on herb nodes (for varietal seed gathering purposes):  
---
Copper: Doesn't change the node into anything else (T0 herbs don't exist, after all!)  
---
Iron: Can yield varietal peppercorn.  
---
Steel: Doesn't seem to yield any varietal seeds.  
---
Darksteel: Can yield varietal sesame.  
---
Mithril: Can yield varietal mint.  
---
Orichalcum: can yield varietal cilantro.  
---
Logically, this should mean that when you use Glyph of Alchemy:  
---
Copper: Gives varietal peppercorn.  
---
Iron: Probably won't yield seeds.  
---
Steel: Gives varietal sesame.  
---
Darksteel: Gives varietal mint.  
---
Mithril: Gives varietal cilantro.  
---
Orichalcum: No effect (because T7 herbs don't exist).
---
TL;DR: When you do the daily node farm gathering route, use Glyph of the Crucible on Spinach, Strawberries, Cauliflower, Sugar Pumpkin, Artichoke, Butternut Squash, and Seaweed nodes (Flax nodes should also work, but Flax is pretty valuable as it is...)  
---
Use Glyph of Alchemy on Carrots, Lettuce, Potato, Grapes, and Cabbage nodes.
---
It's \~6 hours for 2 Mystic Clovers, with full boosters and starting from 0 participation. No way that's fast. You are better off farming at Dragonfall for that amount of time and getting all the materials and gold for about 40-60 clovers in the same amount of time.
---
Basically because he's burnt out on GW2. 
---
Don't get me wrong, FFXIV may be a good game for some too, there is a trail until level 35. It's a much more traditional MMO compared to GW2.
---
If you don't enjoy GW2 when you played it for a bit, you can try if you like FFXIVs approach better.
---
It is balanced quite well. First, the design is that everyone plays with same possible stats regardless of equipment and such, you basically can make it out of tutorial, go into pvp lobby and get same build as anyone else.
---
All builds don't perform same though. Many builds do have counterbuild, so you can find balance to be a lot in spirit of rock-paper-scissors on 1vs1 basis. That means, you need to learn when to fight and when to run, when to switch positions with teammate that is more suited for the job. As teams are 5vs5, those inbalances should even out. Some builds perform better as people naturally search for every advantage they can get, but there are balance patches that try to make it better over time.
---
So yes, it is fairly balanced numbers wise, the rest is based on personal skills of player, and here you can find huge differences. It means that if you get good, you can win many fights against same geared players. But also lose against better skilled ones. No numbers or better equip will help you :)
---
It could be plausible. I mean are we REALLY sure they’re not our everday cat?
---
Yeah it would be nice to have a ingame options instead of using taco.
---
If you have bought the basegame, there are differences to the F2P version. Access to the tradingpost, no limits on communication. It is a different thing.
---
thanks for the insight
---
This is an appropriate price for a &gt;10s utility item
---
The underwater stuff would be pretty intresting considering this is looking like the underwater expansion/season, but if these were in the file the entire time I'm pretty sure they were in it for completion's sake.
---
If they are recent additions that would be a reason to get hyped.
---
Switch maps into a major city.
---
All the levelup rewards are spaced out so new person is introduced to various game mechanics over time and not at once, so it is absolutely a difference. I doubt anyonee would read through all mechanics in one go, but getting one small read every few hours is way more acceptable.
---
1: For new players, there's an absurd amount of content to last you for years, depending on your play time.
---
2: Play and experience the world and combat from level 1. Look into external resources to decide what you want class you want to start with.
---
3: GW2 is not your traditional MMORPG.
---
I don't disagree with you on most points except the 'if you don't like it leave' mentality. But I'm not arguing something I won't change your mind about. My one point is 'Theyll come back 2 years later with more confidence' mate they've been playing with no breaks since beta. They've played this game for 7 years and are still bad, they come into something where they can't just coast by on autoattacks and then leave because apparently that's the most elite and difficult content. Raids have been out for 4 years and this person is just now trying it after having had 4 years to prepare and 7 years to learn their class. You want me to give someone a decade to learn how to press more than one button every 4 seconds?
---
\*their kingdom.
---
Ascalon was charr land to begin with. They were mearly trying to drive out the usurpers.
---
hey, that almost costs as much as an entire stack of the non-feast version which i could just send to all my friends if the mail restrictions weren't so harsh.
---
&gt; "I can outrun a centaur." 
---
Well good for you, human, because you sure as hell can't *beat* them. 
---
While I don't mind the inverse-trope of Human's Last Stand instead of Humans Are F'ing Everywhere, getting pushed around by centaurs makes them feel pathetic.
---
Looking forward to this. There's so much potential that JPs have as repeatable content that adventures might not offer. Simply adding some map currency for completing it would cause way more people to be interested in speedrunning them.
---
On one hand, it's sad that the big jumping puzzle designer Josh Foreman left Anet earlier this year, but on the other hand maybe we could get some more unique designs with some new minds working on them now?
---
You mean their ancestors took it. And then who did they take it from? It's always someone's until it's yours.
---
Adelbern was doing pretty much what the charr did during the Searing, can't blame him.
---
For all we know, dropping a feast used to crash the server, and port everyone in the raid to the middle of the unending sea in a downed state.
---
Not being able to drop them in the raid might have been the fix that came from their beta testing.
---
I wish I was being completely sarcastic.
---
Is it possible to configure this game to be controller friendly? I'm a FF14 player, but I played this for a time a while back and I'm thinking of peeking back into it when there's content dry spells. The problem is, I have small hands and find KB&amp;M to be uncomfortable, and FF14's controller-friendliness is really attractive. If I can get a setup that lets this game work well alongside a controller, it'll really endear me to it.
---
I've updated the wiki page for chef to show effects of herbs and the base foods:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chef#Ascended\_Crafting](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chef#Ascended_Crafting) 
---
basically every base recipe can be combined with every herb, so 12x5 in total for now.
---
Yeah, well we HAD Gaile Grey...
---
But they decided to lay her off rather than laying off a developer. Tough decision.
---
&gt; On berserker, Headbutt is part of the DPS rotation
---
Is headbutt + outrage better dps than signet of might?
---
I see no promise from ANET for any hand held container fashioned from canvas, so not quite the same dev process as Bethesda
---
Guess ill start logging out my toons there
---
currently the ghosts endlessly re-live their daily lives unaware that everything they have ever known has come to an end. it's blissfull existence, better than submitting your country to charr and letting them eat/torture everyone.
---
There's all kinds of stupid people in this world.
---
You got promised build templates. A couple of years ago.
---
...maybe you're right, it's not all copied from Bethesda, some is from Wollay.
---
I'm sorry but like so many other you don't understand the point of my post, of course they made it that way so you don't walk in there and gather in 5mn.
---
My point is CCs and mechanics meant to stall you rather than to kill you are stupid, make the mobs actually threatening if you want to make it a challenge, I can literally stand in the middle of 5 mobs and walk away with 80% health.
---
Plus, there are so many other parts of the game where these types of mobs exist, in PoF for example, where the mobs' aggro range is way too high just to put you in combat every second, even when there's no reason to do so.
---
What everyone seems to be misunderstanding is that I'm not looking for "help", i'm just wondering if there is maybe a better way to go about that "challenge" you speak of in open world.
---
Well that doesnt work currently either
---
A hack is a mod (short for modification), a mod is a hack. The only reason we use different words is to differentiate their intention.
---
A DPS meter gives a very real advantage too. It literally provides more information about the game.
---
TACO gives a MASSIVE advantage. We wouldn't use ANY tools if they didn't.
---
We don't have modding support so everything (except for the overlays) are literally hacks. They inject code into the executable, for fuck sake.
---
In this instance, it wasn't being used to cheat in any way whatsoever. It's a privately developed hackmod/modhack and only used for the ERP.
---
But they didn't ban anyone, did they? They didn't mention a specific exception, so they're pretending like they didn't know. Often they don't ban PvP and WvW hackers for ages (if at all) anyway. Even the people trading wins were left alone.
---
ANet rules are bullshit, inconsistent and applied on a whim based on however they feel that day. And it's been that way since launch.
---
&gt; benchmarks on golem dont match bosses? i mean yea, thats common sense
---
Exactly. The 7k difference only applies to the golem, not to samarog
---
The belly jiggles too!! But you know, thyroid problems...
---
Yes, but i did the nevermore collection, and for that you have to kill him
---
This is just depressing. Whenever an AAA dev fucks up, it's something to talk about due to sheer size or hilarity of it. At least I can laugh.
---
Whenever ANet fucks up, it's just part and parcel of playing GW2. It disappoints even there.
---
Then you would do precisely what my aunt does. It never fails.
---
I get the opposite feeling. Throughout the story, the centaurs keep getting pushed further and further back. It really seems like the initial battle outside Divinity was the closest the centaurs have come to a decisive victory. After that, they don't win a single battle as far as I can remember. They're driven out of Queensdale, their Kessex forts get captured, their assaults into the Gendarran Fields keep being thwarted, and the story in the Harathi Hinterlands indicate that their homelands are falling too. 
---
Granted, I main Asura and got used to Metrica Province in the early game, so I suppose people who are more acquainted with Queensdale's events may have a different view on it, but I've gotten the feeling that the humans just keep winning after the Queensdale battle. Which is boring.
---
I'm almost wondering if Anet will make them account bound.  having 3 alts mean I can get up to 4x per seed planted, that seems wrong since the other unique plants for the Utility/food primers are account bound.
---
Anything ascended is almost account bound from the start....
---
WE'VE BEEN ALLOWED TO PLAY ON THE TEST SERVERS IN THE PAST...
---
In fact some people had to consult ANet to delete their test toons because when they cut us off from the test servers our test toon names were still locked in.
---
i would like doing JP if they had good reward system, smth akin to beetle racing. whats the point of doing them more than once if i have the achiev already? i mean sure you can go there once in a while if you're bored, but there's no real incentive
---
I wanted to respond to this comment with link to bug megathread, but there is none for this patch for some reason.
---
The new necro spec, Death Moth
---
yessss.
---
would be cool to get various biomes to choose from and then place the house, river, forest, whatever.
---
I'll just add that I think the main issue was UI. It can be really hard to find decent UI designers / coders and they generally have to go through a lot of iterations.
---
Heck, look at the "Customize" UI when it first launched. Even now, it's better but not amazing.
---
As a backend programmer, I can assure you that UI is the literal devil.
---
Yes.
---
Well if you’re not using the mechanics at your disposal, how is the phrase ”learn to play” incorrect? He gave you answers for basically every class and instead of taking that in you got *super* defensive and drop phrases like ”white knight” and ”pro player”  that are only meant to stirr up conflict. If the phrase ”learn to play” was enough for you to go this deep then I’m not sure how anyone could say something remotely rude to you without getting a 30 pages document in their inbox.
---
They definitely are waging a good defensive campaign, but AFAIK they don't really win any major battles after the one  outside Divinity. They managed to get there, so how come the humans are able to overcome anything the centaurs do after the first mission?
---
3 garden plots? Did they add one or are these different garden plots?
---
I was mostly adding to your point. But yeah, I should have mentioned them in my post.
---
as much as it takes until it's not failed attempt
---
I get the soap taste too. And those British cookshows add it on every single dish for some reason
---
Humans were brought to Tyria by the gods. To most of the races that already existed on Tyria, humans were an invasive species. Not to mention the oldest human civilizations were Cantha and Orr. Definitely not Ascalon.
---
And besides, whether Adelbern was "doing what the charr did pretty much," shouldn't apply. Remember how they were seen as barbaric? The king of the "good guys" shouldn't resort to that, especially when it means enslaving the souls of his people for an eternity of rage and suffering.
---
There should be levels of JPs. I don’t find it fun AT ALL - it’s just jumping, you can do it anywhere on the map. But here we are, there re achievements that I want to get. If I could do the simple level, I might be doing them all. But at this current set up, no thanks.
---
&gt; Are you trying to say that between, the release of episode 4 (since the leak is about episode 5 and 6), that would be about 6-7 months,
---
The leak was posted 10months ago, I'm not sure why you're even disputing how long ago it was posted when it's right next to the reddit post.
---
&gt;they completely scrapped both the raid they were working on, and the maps they had planned for 5 and 6 (cause his leak about episode 5 is also hilariously wrong), and complete redid both of them in 6 months? Utter lunacy.
---
Do you know how many maps and shit they've worked on only to scrap it? There was an entire new WvW map and tons of PvP ones that were basically almost done - Never got made public.
---
Leaks are not exclusively complete content, It can be stuff that literally hasn't been started yet.
---
Considering the layoffs, I would imagine a lot of stuff got dropped.
---
lol what was Anet thinking when they made that?  Like, there has never been a time in this games history where that material cost would even come close to reasonable.  Were they thinking you would be able to roll this thing in the mystic forge with some other expensive stuff to make a reusable one and it got scrapped?
---
”So I was doing my daily winterberry gathering and **as always** I couldn’t help but notice **how obnoxious every mob** with all the **permanent chill**, **getting stuck in iceblocks, knockbacks** griffion evading for hours...”
---
This is a direct quote from you post where I highlighted both your complaints and the frequency. If this is not a complaint then I do not know what complaining is anymore.
---
Demotivated people don't work quite as hard as people who are encouraged.
---
Constructive feedback is completely different to "FurnaceTaken".
---
Scripture says they were brought to Tyria by the gods. Recent story has suggested that there's more fantasy to the stories than what's been told, much like in real religion.
---
And nah, it's easy to say that in hindsight but when quite literally everything in your world, your family, your people, the literal land you grew up on is being *destroyed* by a barbaric war machine, I think nobody has the right to tell you you should've taken the moral high ground.
---
I'm skeptical about this post. Obviously it's not new? Did you post this with the intention of getting upvotes for a leak of one of the new elite specs? You said you pulled it from the Gw2Browser, so you must already know about the current specializations that's been in the game for two years.
---
Yes, that all *exists* but look at everything else around it. All of Queensdale, save for the southeast corner, is painted with bright colors with happy-go-lucky fields where common issues are either A) bandits are pestering us, or B) centaurs are pestering us.
---
So yeah, centaurs have a presence, but given the way they're used, they're hardly posed as threatening. And even then, they're mostly overshadowed by bandits. Go outside Queensdale and you'll find more bandits, pirates, centaurs, krait, ettins, Nightmare Court, and even Mordrem.
---
To say that centaurs are a big part of Kryta's problems feels really misleading. They come off as pests in most maps, with only Harathi Hinterlands to really solidify their image as a threat. Even then, bandits have a pretty strong presence there, too.
---
So when the most prolific enemy of humanity is a bunch of goofy-written humans, how are we supposed to feel like humanity is really being oppressed by the outside world?
---
Not to mention, Caudecus's eternal festival in DR also stands against the image of humanity's plight. I think ANet wanted two different things from Kryta and ended up with something really watered down because of it.
---
\&gt;  i didn't, but can it get worse?
---
When I used to play ranked, it was pretty common to see people wishing terminal illnesses like cancer on the family of players who failed once or twice. Racism and sexism was extremely common too.
---
Nope, it was a simple observation of what's literally going on in the game. Also nothing you proposed negates anything.
---
Still waiting for valid arguments so the actual point of my post though, if you ever come to understand it.
---
what do you mean by "level"?
---
The only way to explain this ridiculously insane recipe is that whoever made this station used deldrimor ingots instead sharpening stones because they were shown the icons for the items that had to be required for the recipe instead being given the actual names of the items that should go in the recipe, and deldrimor ingots kind of look like sharpening stones  so they mixed them up. 
---
It would make more sense to require something more in line with the ascended feast recipes, but considering these won't have all the extra bonuses, like: 
---
* Something that can be bought daily at any faction provisioner for 1 provisioner token each.
---
 * For the daily timegate we all 'l♡ve' so much and we know has to be there whether we like it or not. 
---
 * Up to 4 could be bought per main release: 4 at any Core privsioner, another four in HoT and provisioners would also be added to PoF, offering another daily 4. 
---
* 5 of a level 80 Utility item.
---
 * For the 2 base stats the item will have. Let's face it, if it required something like 20 or 50, hardly any of the people using the station would refund any of the cost, so it's only fair to keep the cost to 5.
---
* Rename Crafter's Backpack Frame to "Wooden Frame", increase price to 10s, and require 5-10 for the recipe. 
---
 * For the gold sinks, and so that material only used for crafting backs stops being such a waste of a material storage slot. 
---
* And maybe 10 Obsidian shards, for the karma sink.
---
I think the game, as is, is frankly pretty bad. Nothing but wasted potential. If there was any alternative to WvW in other games i would have left long ago. Mind you, I think the story in this game has always been garbage and living story nothing but a mistake.
---
Well if you’re going to shot down every counter argument in this post then I guess you win by default. Have a good day
---
Lack of object permanence, maybe? xD
---
If shutting down means proving you wrong, then I guess I do.
---
Good day to you as well
---
Yeah but WoW has been "dying" since day one. With a short break during Wrath of the Lich King.
---
I guess someone copy and pasted the effect from Bowl of Spicy Meat Chili
---
here's how i do it with power necro:
---
first i read patch notes and look which of the changes are dmg buff/nerf
---
then i have many ideas in my head about them, different combinations i could try, see if it's in fact better this way or if it doesn't change anything
---
i don't do math cuz i'm bad at it, but i do sometimes refer to necro coefficient spreadsheet someone [posted](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PSRrYkvxP6C0QxuOt_xt1ETmccDjea83pAz0ODzTZZ0/edit#gid=0)
---
i go to the golem area and i try all of my ideas out - if there's visible difference even after 1 try then i stick with it and try to polish it even more. 
---
i try out different runes and sigils if applicable (for example accuracy vs impact on reaper, impact always came out better for me)
---
there are few players that also work on reaper, sometimes their ideas were better than mine, for example the opening rotation on power reaper wasn't my idea, but i improved the mid section. so i look them up too and double check their stuff on my golem
---
you need to make sure your gear is optimised, so all infusions +9+5 etc 
---
and it's much easier if it's a class you main for 7 years, you do everything by intuition, you get "the feel" factor down
---
Offenece fully intended, you've got to be the biggest assclown I've ever seen. 
---
He asked you a simple question and not only were you a snide smug unhelpful smartass about it, you got butthurt ontop of it when you were called out.
---
Grow up you pathetic manchild.
---
He wasn't enjoying GW2. That's reason enough to switch. His friends are on WoW Classic.
---
This. IIRC, the Black Lion Store is separate from the main game (Web server running on IIS, if I remember correctly). Disabling something from a separate application it probably a lot easier than futzing with an extremely complicated game
---
An asura having a very bad day at a paintball game?
---
If we take Head of the Snake into account, the centaurs were effective, because they got support, intel and slaves from Caudecus' Manor and the Seraphs could really use a rank above captain to effectively coordinate larger campaigns. The biggest threat to humans was always infighting, which seems to be their defining weakness.
---
Well I quit 3 weeks after launch, coming from years of playing GW1 only, so that'd be a hard pass for me.
---
The joy of no shared inventory slots
---
wait 2 days and I'll let you know.
---
no LFG, overtuned dungeons, an Orr where you couldn't take 5 steps without being "Death... Good!"'ed and yanked back by a random mob, no gliding, no mounts
---
There's actually a meta event where a group of Flame Legion charr try to use the Searing Cauldron to renuke Ascalon. If you fail at stopping them, they end up destroying parts of a nearby town. It doesn't get fully destroyed, though.
---
What? No.
---
Plus imagine of ending up in another instance then where you placed the food 😂
---
I mean, it's not the cheapest thing to do 🙈😄
---
the Joy of no Wardrobe
---
Dad bod!
---
The next Champion Rush event, probably, hence the name.

That's been in the game files for quite awhile; I remember seeing it on the wiki awhile back.

&gt; Would be very cool for a Paragon warrior spec to use Spear

GUARDIAN DRAGOON SPEC WHEN
---
The guy asked OP what armor he was using and he accurately responded, and went as far to explain why the outfit behaved this way. The guy basically said 'oh you really couldn't infer what I meant from what I asked' as if he is supposed to read his mind. Might I add asking the armor is a legit question, especially for people who know the aura but can not recognize the armor due to the ubique gimmick on Charr.
---
It is kind enough for the OP to inform people repeatedly, but he doesn't have to take that guy's or your bullshit. Fuck off.
---
So, let's start at the beginning:
---
Episode 4 was released in september, almost 12 months ago.
---
Episode 5 was released in january, 9 months ago.  
---
The leak was released around october 15th.  Here's what it said about episode 5:
---
Episode 5: Jan 2019. New map south of The Desolation. You ally with survivors from Balthazar's army, and assault a branded volcano. New mastery lets a friend ride on your moount, they get special combat skills, you'll need to use these in the new map a lot. New Fractal: Glint's Lair. You help Turai Ossa ascend, fighting the doppelgänger, forgotten priests, and Glint herself. Challenge mode included.
---
Tell me what he "leaked" about episode 5 even remotely resembles what happens in episode 5.  But, according to you, in 3 months, they managed to completely scrap all that work, and create an entirely new and different episode 5.
---
WvW and pvp maps aren't story content.  The "leak" describes story content.  That's not as easy to scrap (especially in 3 fucking months). 
---
The layoffs happened after episode 5, in February of this year.  So, after the layoffs, they scrapped all the work they did on episode 6, wing 7, and the legendary ring, and made an entirely different raid wing, LS map, and legendary ring effect...in 3 months?  That's just ludicrous.
---
Hehe, sure, but you can also break them without mounts :&gt;
---
Eh I'll give 'em that. I preferred dungeons like they were before HoT
---
Just send a bug report on it
---
&gt;no 38 slot bags
---
32
---
Wondering too
---
oh the classic gw2 with barely any content in it, i so want to go back
---
&gt;  dualwield all one handed weapons (excluding offhand only weapons like shield).
---
wtb awkward turtle warrior spec.
---
I don't think you can return it after this long. :^)
---
QADIIIIIIIM!
---
They have been very specific that the announcement is about Living World season 5 only. I don't get why people think it will be about an expansion, competitive game modes, raids or fractals, or any number of things people are foaming at the mouth over. People are setting themselves up for disappointment and are then going to rage that ANET didn't talk about any of the things they wanted them to talk about. This is going to be exclusively story focused, and what people really want is QoL and systems updates. I would love to be wrong.
---
oh i see, interesting. thank you!!!
---
&gt;lol what was Anet thinking when they made that?
---
It's to get on par with Guild Hall decorations...
---
already have. It is just mind boggling to me how such obvious things can be missed.
---
Sure more intricate issues can be overlooked sometimes but just rightclicking on an item which is explicitly mentioned in the patchnotes should not be a hard task for a capable QA team.
---
&gt; We should be able to explore tyria with all the wonderful excitement of virgin eyes 
---
Just because the game will be reseted doesn't mean your brain will be.
---
They do have a QA team its just compare testing a game with a few people then putting it on live where thousands of people are trying it at the same time something going to go wrong.
---
Then selbbub be on our side since jormag is a selfish beech!
---
Yeah remember back when Raids didnt take 9 months, god we have it so good now
---
I didn't. 5 people, huddling in a corner with the boss and spamming everything they have wasn't exactly entertaining. They took forever to finish, too, because every enemy group took ages to kill.
---
Just play ff14
---
Yup this is the experience us raiders had.  Guild works all day on leveling someone's cooking, prepares expensive feasts for raids, get ready with a thank-you speech for everyone that helped (not kidding)....
---
Only to be met with pure disappointment and heartbreak.
---
The feast interactable item stays active for five minutes; the buff still lasts an hour.
---
*laughs in charr*
---
Oh for sure, but there is something really satisfying to skipping to the end of a puzzle like Skipping Stone or Dark Reverie by climbing then jumping off a mountain.
---
I quickly glossed over the blog post.
---
It is mandatory to hear what the other side has to say. As well as her ex boss at that Vancouver studio.
---
No names called, even the name of the studio?
---
She contradicts herself several times, like with her doing the job and not getting paid, and then in one email she acknowledges that she didnt upload her most recent work for 8(!) months because some stuff related with svn"system was giving me errors". If she wanted to upload them, she would contact some devops and resolve the issue in no time. And then she actually gets paid, while her employer could very well show her the middle finger, and to top it all off, she calls that "abuse".
---
She offered some links to her work, and that shit is trippy, it's something a high school kid on meth would make, probably. Not even the word "indie" can defend that.
---
On the other hand, if it's all true, she's been living with this for \~8 years now, and i can't even imagine how hard that hurts.
---
All-in-all, shady stuff, need more info.
---
Was a reference to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRWvfMLl4ho)
---
No leak.
---
Yeah bring back 1.0 Shadow Behemoth and Claw. Was sooooo good back then
---
But the bloodshed was not needed in the first place, both city states could of came to some sort of agreement, at least in the future they could've. However humans are just as much in fault as in this situation.
---
&gt;But there's no proof they started making ascended food before templates.
---
Well hind sight is 20/20.  Black lion garden plots were released 20 months ago.  And back then we suspiciously only had access to 2 plots even though they put 3 in the home instance, and now with the cooking update we finally have 3/3.  So It looks like they had plans for 500 cooking going back more than 20 months.  How long were they working on build templates?  No idea.  But if it takes more than 20 months to make them after deciding to do it, then they are clearly not prioritizing them.  
---
Also in case your curious about the time lines (I know I was), 24 months ago, some random guy released build templates with unofficial official Anet support.  And 27 months ago he made them without official Anet support.
---
Yeah, it *is* much better they are there for tokens only.
---
Fractals aren't the same as dungeons sadly.
---
&gt; I'm also missing playing it
---
You should hop back in then.  You have 3 expansion/seasons worth of content, and a new Necro elite spec to play with.  I think it'll be worth your time.
---
They're not setting themselves up to be disappointed. They're hoping that the game modes they play will actually be supported, because otherwise there's no future for them.
---
Yup this is it, not new at all.
---
I love afk autoattacking and not actually playing, for what else would I even play videogames?
---
Also competitive against your own past clears (can I improve on my mechanics/rotation), or friendly competitions for top DPS.
---
Between this and the redacted statement from the watch company. Something is definitely going on.
---
Not sure if you intended this or not, but you gave us charr an easy win.
---
Fractals are luckily much better. 99 and 100CM blow all other 5man content out of the water with how insanely well designed and fun they are.
---
&gt;©
---
What did he do?
---
Too easy xD
---
They shouldn't happen, but they do. Any game will have stuff like this and you need to actually know *why* it happens to understand it instead of complaining.  
---
The feature was probably implemented, it worked fine in test builds and it was left alone. Once it hits the server it's a whole new level of fun, it may be something you are wearing, where you are at, what's in your inv, maybe a letter was misplaced in the update causing it to not work as intended, hell half the time it works *flawless* on test server and when it hits live it turns to shit. 
---
Maybe it wasn't fully ready, it was updated to reflect that "Not in this patch" which was mistaken as "In this patch" to the compiler of the code, mistakes happen, we are all humans.  
---
Maybe it was written, tested easy code and shipped on, another update broke the code (it happens) or maybe it was a last minute addition for next patch that is yet to be tested and was added to cut down on the next patch size that squeaked by that broke it, yet again it happens, were all humans.  
---
Maybe it was a last minute addition decided to be squeaked in as a QoL improvement deemed as a simple fix and a code forgot a space.
---
Checking to see if the new features are even in the fucking patch shouldn’t change with test size. Even then, if that was really the problem then why the fuck does a game in 2019 not have a public test server?
---
Same here bring me back before arcdps ruined the game and all the toxic hardcore players started runnimg around
---
Judging by Guild Chat and the seemingly wrong colors for food salvage, the interns are running the game development now. 
---
Dude, 'Do you even play?'
---
This is the only thing that makes sense, since normal feasts and Hero's banners can be placed just fine.
---
(Not that it makes it acceptable on Anet's part, but at least it will get fixed/)
---
They literally said don’t take that out of context after.
---
Hmmm this could go either way.
---
I never said it wasn’t...   we were talking about something getting disabled.
---
Yeah those are the best ones. There are also a bunch which aren't nearly as good and some instabilities are stupid. Luckily the worst two have been removed.
---
An obvious alternative is making elites that let you equip tridents/harpoons as normal land two-handed weapon.
---
You can contact support and give them the names of your chars, they can easily restore them, I read somewhere they can restore one though, not more. Look up here and explain to them the situation: https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010181213-Restoring-a-Deleted-Character
---
No.
---
The difference between GW2 and WoW is that WoW got gradually worse, while GW2 is getting gradually better.
---
No, the trading post lag is caused by something else. There's been thousands of people buying things since the launch of the game, but it's never been lagging consistently for months on end, so there's definitely something else going on.
---
The map-change-to-get-rid-of-lag thing has been made irrelevant, since the item scroller doesn't stack up to infinity anymore.
---
And anet should not get alot of slack here. Ascended food is a big release for the game and while its understandable how we could have gotten here the fact that we are here highlights flaws in anets processes.
---
&gt; It is not obvious. If I knew what the aura looked like and wasn't aware of the Charr glitch, I would have asked what armor was that too. I mean its only natural when you ask someone what armor they are using, they tell you what armor they are using right?
---
Except when the aura is so interwined with the armour that they basically look like one and the same, and considering that there are armours in the game that look like this, its not immediately clear that someone is going to be wearing both.
---
&gt;Actually taking time to answer the guy's questions is not snideful. OP did not use any insults or anything. If anything he was blunt, but he still answered what was asked. The guy expecting OP to infer what he meant and then calling him out was snideful. Like who the fuck are you?
---
I except it that by the second comment where it was made obvious that the guy was after the magma glow, for OP to say "Oh I'm using an aura" instea of taking 3 entire comments of being intentionally obscure past that.
---
&gt;Another way to look at this is that OP responded the guy 5 times.
---
I mean yeah, if you give shit answers that don't actually answer of course the other guy is gonna keep asking.
---
Let me introduce to the wonderful technology of recording if you dont plan to interact with the chat anyways. But hey everything is going great. :)
---
Sort of but not really. In any given raid group, you could have people using:
---
*100 power 70 ferocity
---
*100 power 70 precision
---
*100 precision 70 ferocity (no ascended variant)
---
*100 condi 70 expertise
---
*100 expertise 70 condi
---
*15% burn duration 70 precision (no ascended variant)
---
*10% healing, 70 healing power
---
*100 concentration 70 toughness
---
*100 concentration 70 power
---
*100 concentration 70 healing
---
and that's not even all of them. At most, you'll have maybe 6-7 players able to share the power/fero food (though it'll usually be less), but the support players are still kinda fucked if they want to use ascended.
---
I love that people still reference that video. Had a bonding moment at my first job when we all remembered seeing that on TV as kids.
---
Hahfshfaha fuck that shit, I would sell the deldrimor and make some gold.
---
Thank you, someone remembers the correct historical reason. This was more of a bloodstone dump than anything else.
---
QAAAADDIIIIIIIIIIIMMMMM!
---
&gt; common sense and maturity
---
This is /r/GuildWars2 you're talking about
---
He gave me multiple uninformative answers and was being intentionally vague with nearly every single one them.
---
[Look at this.](http://prntscr.com/oyrqxv)
---
By that point it should have pretty clear I thought the glow was associated with the armour itself, and yet he still went out of his way to actually avoid mentioning its source to the point where it took me 4 comments to finally get it out of him.
---
I think some guys who play darksouls had a bit of fun dualwielding giant shields. Looked hillarious.

"shitty" anniversary stream has more viewers than teapots "amazingly interesting" wow gameplay...

Housing would be "actual content" but I agree with you that there are more interesting things. Not a big fan of the concept mylself, but would be happy with a bedroll and a campfire novelty… and a smoking pipe
---
What are you talking about? Anet didn't talk about build templates until a few *months* ago and even then they specified that they had no timeline for the feature.
---
I'm not ArenaNet, didn't think I'd have to make that statement.
---
*I am Forgal, son of Kern. My father was the last Dolyak Shaman! I am a Warmaster of the Vigil! You will never make me kneel!*
---
This needs an award...
---
But I’m not saying one nation is ‘innocent.’ That’s my point. Neither humans nor Charr are good or evil. They’re just doing what nations do: trying to hold onto their land.
---
please at least read the related patch note...
---
Oh im serious all right. Anet needs to stoping catering to these toxic players and just delete wvw and spvp they only encourage toxic behaviors and have nothing to do with the living world story. Why should i have to leave by beautiful home instance just to craft my gen 1 legends its totally unfun and not fair.
---
Usually every third chest yeah.
---
It’s a good idea but hard to fit into a student schedule. If I got the rare time to play video games I want to do something fun not farm keys. ):
---
Spot on. Wish NCSOFT took control, even if there's a chance for it to get worse, at least there's a chance for it to get better too.
---
Yeah, only that it isn't that easy. The main issue will still be there that you promote to hack the game for an "event".
---
Ridiculous recipes are one of this game's most recurrent problems. Many of them don't make any sense, and we aren't talking about just a few here and there, there's dozens of them.
---
no
---
WoW did not get any worse then GW2 did.
---
Gw2 powercreep is fucking stupid.

Hello fellow human players of this virtual environment do you also want to know this particular employee's favorite quaggan because boy oh boy I sure want to know more about quaggans and be happy and consume goods and services for this videogame monetization platform.

Masterwork extract, hiccuping, "I'm the only one that's tilted like ascended bottle!" :)
---
And those seed pouches going randomly left/right/square/triangle... :( 
---
Also some foods in-between give two different rarity of extracts. Like strawberry ghost, for example. So it's twice as good (without counting some trays that are 10x of single item food)
---
You're on EU servers, right?
---
Why even bother then? It's like the stupid guild chats they did right after releasing a patch.
---
Right when everyone is playing and no one's gonna bother missing out the novelties to ask some questions that probably won't get any replies anyway.
---
Yep i filled a report she also slashed the tires of my bike, broke everything made out of glass that i had in my kitchen and TOOK my freaking dog.
---
Stay in FFXIV weeaboo troll.
---
Or maybe the ones responding without taking the time to think for a second are not "everyone", in fact the post isn't at 0% so there are plenty of people understanding, even maybe agreeing with me, that don't bother posting because of the sheer amount of circlejerk that comes from reddit.
---
Also you should stop assuming things, especially when you're so far off the mark, it just shows how bad you are at it.
---
I think he means like jumping puzzle ratings, like novice, intermediate, expert level jumping puzzles with increasing awards at each tier.
---
I don't know that I would be a fan of those, but I see why someone might want something like that.
---
But ArenaNet can do no wrong! Haven't you been paying attention?
---
Oh, let me guess, you're one of those toxic players! Boo! Go away with your toxic logic! Booooo!
---
Would just be a waste IMO, especially when weapons can be specifically designed to work with a spec already.
---
If it was missed, that means it was done manually by person, that means they wasted probably like a whole day of a technical game designer instead of asking a programmer to automatize the process in a several minutes and change all the food in a matter of seconds. Why?
---
At this point, underwater content is pretty sink or swim.
---
Long term relationships with you must be stressful :D

Ty vm, 7000+ hours zero deaths across the entre account. Quite achivement
---
Future proofing. This probably didn't take long to make anyway, they're fairly simple images. (A single professional artist shouldn't take long to make stuff like this)
---
Yeah content that's not standing around in home instance is just too hard. We need heroes from GW1 back so we can be carried through content with no effort again. If you want to group, or play engaging content, this game is not for you and you should just quit. Practicing content is like a job and too elitist.
---
Hello fellow human, do you think it's cool to come to someone's anniversary celebration full of people sharing fun tidbits, and repeatedly scream major work-related questions when those are scheduled to be addressed in less than 2 days?

I wanted to stay home last the weekend playing the game, cause i was tired and didnt had will to go out she rants like crazy about me not wanting to go into a night club with her saturday, i was literally ignoring her and playing the game while she was screaming at me, then she goes even nutter pulled the power cable turning off my computer (i was during a raid btw) and asked me: YOU GOTTA CHOOSE: GO OUT WITH ME OR STAY PLAYING THAT KIDS GAME. 
---
Dell i Just pointed her the door
---
Theres literally someone from QA on the anniversary stream right now.
---
the joy of a pile of shitty traits where the best choice is whichever is the least worst
---
Damn! What the hell did you do? LMAO
---
Turns out video games actually cause violence..for ones that don't play them.
---
died 0 times? What were you doing all this time? Petting quaggans? XD
---
I am pretty interested to know what we will get, elite specs being a top want, but it amazes me how people can't handle their shit.
---
It's almost as if Anet streams during their *work time from their office*.
---
That really kind of sucks. I'll see if I can do a test later on by killing two NPCs and see if I get more/same XP.
---
I swear, some times these games expect us all to be lawyers or something.
---
&gt; an Orr where you couldn't take 5 steps without being "Death... Good!"'ed and yanked back by a random mob
---
and for those who actually miss that they could just  go to some PoF zones
---
Why does this Skyscale have a hump?
---
Ah yes, incel-lites
---
You can cheese most of them with mounts.

---
7k viewers an hour after he stopped is indeed curious. Not that I care either way very much.
---
How's that even possible, fam? I reckon it's a API bug.
---
This is what would happen to our Skyscales if Thanos came to Tyria, snapped his fingers, and half of ~~The Avengers~~ Dragon's Watch turned into dust.
---
I don't think the game is the reason. Sounds like the two of you were a bad match.
---
I don't see why you would think otherwise. This isn't the first time that a booster has specified XP and WXP boosts next to each other, it's pretty clear that they're separate systems requiring separate buffs. I mean the WvW foods don't even have XP buffs on them; you think anyone would use them if that was a helpful buff in WvW?
---
Rubi's weight gain concerns me a bit. That can't be healthy. Hope she is okay.
---
Yeah man I agree, these ArenaNet devs should be getting flogged on stream instead.
---
When will devs realise they're not people, they're property. They exist to service us, and no more. If we aren't pleased, they should suffer.
---
GAMERS RISE UP.
---
Look here, he answered every question accurately. That is as good as it gets. 
---
It is you pulling out of your ass that the guy's wrong question should be obviously understood and cleared out when he made little to no attempts to get it through. On top of that he immediately called OP out on the very first response about how he was being snide.
---
Okay, what the fuck
---
Or Lake Doric.
---
You should consider doing sexual art for GW2. Not being sarcastic or trolling, it's pretty good.
---
Can't wait until it costs money to repair armor again!
---
Half of them aren't even good sinks anyway, since no one's gonna bother crafting them in the first place.
---
Read his other post - that ex was a rabid, and completely insane cunt. Lock her up in an asylum before she kills the dog she's abducted.
---
Ah yes, because this totally justifies misogyny. What a toxic movement that is.
---
More people than teapot right now though.
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
-  Anet, probably
---
Regardless of the severity of the actions I would say taking action like this is pretty unstable.
---
Putting it in a more gaming related way it's like one of those people who post here complaining about the game even though they supposedly quit or a to a more extreme end, DDoSing the game after they quit.
---
yes lets be sexist and live in alt-right misery to avoid crazy girlfriends
---
Nonono, they just "voice their opinion". It's not toxicity. You're toxic!
---
There was never a need for him to do anything else. That's the parody part of the review.
---
TL;DW Youtuber bashes game coincidentally until the magical 10 minute mark for monetisation.
---
To be fair, I remember the terror that was 1.0 fire elemental. Man that was hype
---
You certainly have it all figured out, you must fulfill your destiny to be a Game QA Manager.
---
Man who doesn't play game well reviews game.
---
IT HAS TO BE ON THE SAME DAY, AT THE EXACT SAME TIME!
---
They are working on build templates, ascended food, S5, the Alliance system and likely a bunch of other things. A simple thing like the inability to pop a feast within a raid instance is currently blocked by a common sense safeguard that prevents raids from being vulnerable to countless potential unintended game mechanics.
---
You might have to wait a few days for them to flip the switch on feasts in raids. Trade in your bitch fork for some adult pants and accept this will pass. Just like cancer, war, famine, Mariah Carey movies and all other horrible things - your great suffering will be over.
---
Hopefully someone at ArenaNet will be flogged and fired, forced to walk down the street naked with the shame bell dinging behind them while people throw rotten food and shit at them - it's just unacceptable that they released ascended feasts in this state and made you experience this completely avoidable amount of possibly days with the inability to pop them inside a raid instance. Hopefully ArenaNet will punish that horrible dev for making you experience this. Clearly they are bad people, they are bad at their jobs, have no idea what they are doing and owe you a great apology. /s
---
OR maybe they made ascended feats. This is an easily missed outlier and a complete non issue. You are looking for things to bitch and moan about no matter how ridiculous and pathetic it makes you look, while everyone else will go about their day eating the food outside the instance until maybe it is changed.
---
FUCK soulbound dyes
---
according to the wiki, the recipe is auto-learned, once you receive it, so double check, if you cant craft the composter via chefs crafting panel
---
Staff is a great Option for solo, since you have acess to almost everything (Aoe, stun, dodge, heal, condi cleanse, etc). But if you are have trouble, I'd say go dagger/focus. Dagger is great for dps while on air, and focus is great for damage mitigation and stuns.
---
Reminds me of a less angry DarkSidePhil. What a time that was.
---
i've always preferred scepter/dagger core ele for open world. that scepter burst is still more than strong enough to end most open world fights, well-before most other builds can wind up their DPS.
---
How do you make it through the day with such extreme oppression thrown at you by ArenaNet?
---
I always try to do the daily jumping puzzles the hard way. i only port if I keep failing due to BS. I still go do Abaddon's Ascent from time to time. Best JP in the game.
---
So just because there were NPCs in GW that were in guilds makes it a good idea to ignore guild content?  How does that logic track?  Strong guilds create a sense of community, which in turn strengthens the game.  Even if you don't want new guild content to participate in personally, to deny their importance in an MMO is disingenuous.
---
Not sure how you botched up Mursaat so badly.
---
I'm sure he's gonna make a ton of ad revenue too ^^/s
---
OKAY KAREN I GET IT
---
Do you not pet quaggans?
---
We need an achievement for petting quaggans.
---
Daggers, no contest.
---
It's not worth it if he cares about organized content, and isn't in a guild. LFG tool is pathetic, and even if you decide to use it, it's most of the time empty. Sure, you can make your own LFG entry and wait 1.25 eternities for anyone to join, but that's *now*. Imagine if announcement is something equally pathetic, like GW2 mobile, and more people leave - you won't be able to play *shit* outside of peak hours.
---
&gt; He is not required to read your mind. He took the time to answer your questions, thats as good as it gets. 
---
Taking the time to be unhelpful is not as good as it gets.
---
&gt; In turn, you should have taken the time to ask things properly, and not blame him for getting 4 comments to answer your questions.
---
How am I supposed to "ask things properly" without knowing every infusion in the game by heart?
---
&gt;If you asked anything like 'How do you look like that?', 'What do you use?', 'What are those effects', I guarantee that you would have gotten the answer in first try. On top of that, you had the nerve to call him out because he couldn't infer what you asked. 
---
You for real?
---
[Look at this exchange.](http://prntscr.com/oysvl7)
---
It doesn't take a mindreader to realize that the answer is "ember infusion" instead of requiring an additional question, considering its basically intentionally omited.
---
&gt;And then basically called him retarded because you couldn't figure out what you are asking for 4 comments.
---
I'm pretty sure I figured out what I was asking from comment one. Excuse me for not memorizing literally every single aura effect in the game.
---
Easy, the pvp and wvw salt pump's me back into the heat 🤙
---
So you can say, the community 😄
---
I just realized I have a life. I also just realized how many don't have one.
---
Why is gw2 twitch so fking sensitive af. I only said : 'Hey baby are you pre event? because you make my Shadow Behemoth rise from the underworld not even directed towards someone looooooool :DD 10 mins timeout REEE
---
Shout out to the Expanse as well. Amazon has some really good shows on deck lately.
---
Maaaaan full respect.
---
You probably don't need to worry about trolling in an organised 10 person group. Anyone causing trouble will be swiftly booted.
---
More than likely they are blocked by the code that blocks every inventory item by default until they manually allow something (even permanent hair kits are blocked in raids). The code exists to avoid any inventory items (like stealth kits, CC items, water fields etc) from being used in raids, instead of balancing raids around them or manually blocking each one, they blocked every inventory consumable and then decided which ones to allow. This is the most efficient way to do it (and it avoids allowed future consumables like the revive consumable from Dragonfall from warping raid balance) which frees them up to spend their time on other things (like more raids).
---
It likely wasn't a problem before - people didn't often pop a feast for only 10 people when so many ran different types of food (condi, power, healing, boons etc) so personal food was the norm and there wasn't much of a demand for feasts in 10 player content. Now that BiS food requires a feast the problem is more visible and likely will get some kind of manual override to allow it to be used in raids.
---
I know, but that is not what this thread is about. Also im aware of the CC bar thing that cant be broken twice. BUT i did test this HP today a few times and the CC bar doesnt apear, even if the champ is killed and respawn.
---
Will full beserker's gear. They have around 11k health. With full Valkyrie (still decent burst damage) I got to 20k health.
---
Hello.
---
Is 5% of all experience gained better than 10% exp from kills? I plan to go for World completion doing events and killing champs, if that helps.
---
But that still makes no sense. A bloodstone sink would be something where all the input is at the very least equal to the output. The deldrimor ingots in that recipe are so valuable that no-one would ever bother with it, this the bloodstone would never be used for this purpose.
---
If the recipe required 5 ingots of each of the ascended crafting mats (dragonite, bloodtstone and empyrial) without any other expensive mats, that would be an actual sink, but attaching a valuable resource to the recipe completely removes its ability to function as a sink (which is why bloodstone is completely pointless even today to most veterans).
---
troubleshoot went on for hours to no avail and no response from support :(
---
i never understood why they make that restrictions **THAT** harsh, only to come up with the execute its to protect against bots... i mean come on you could made the limit cap at 10 per minute and it would still done its purpose like before, but now you dont cripple one of your game functions so bad that noone wants to use it
---
Why the hell would you waste 5 deldrimor ingots to get rid of a bloodstone brick?
---
Buy a guild hall, peasant.
---
Nope, full marauder gear 20k hp, either it’s a one shot or I get down super low and the auto attack finishes me. The fact is you can’t expect the burst if the thief is in stealth and 1200m away... maybe change your build cuz I’ve seen tonnes of players get 18k’ed by dead eyes who are in stealth.
---
https://media1.tenor.com/images/80bb050ba982e83bbc618d43158a167e/tenor.gif?itemid=13521108
---
I tuned in expecting a celebration.  This is far from it.
---
Decorations are good. But Bank agent or TP better not be there. Cause when house gets too convenient, less ppl will hang out at major cities
---
Well yeah 18k is what I get with a well timed assassin's signet, but I don't use it usually. Also, what class do you play?
---
"Do you guys not have PCs?!"
---
How can anyone expect a new game when Anet was axed for working on other games?
---
Yep, they can deal with this kind of thing by performing an account rollback.
---
https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230555167-Account-Restorations-Rollbacks-
---
You muthafucka . . .
---
Yes, how inappropriate to spend an anniversary looking back on the past. Such strange behavior for people to look at where they've come from when they reach a new milestone. /s
---
You don't have to watch the stream...
---
Change the locks, get a account roll back, change the account password
---
Other than raids, i have no problem at all getting a group for CMs, T4s, Metas, bounty trains, and dungeons (though i am in a dungeon-based guild). In reality, you only need a guild for raids. 
---
Then you have WvW and PvP, haven't played PvP at all yet (after 5.5k hours) and i only go to WvW for a Gift of Battle every now and then.
---
We'll see what the announcement brings, but i don't think i'll change my opinion even if they announce that no LWS5 is coming, which should add at least another 100 hours if you are a completionist.
---
checked their account after your edits. better for everyone that his comments don't show up. what a waste of time and air.

Revenant
---
The toxicity is an ironic meme. They aren't really being toxic, they are just memes. It looks like a toxic "veteran", it act's like a toxic "veteran, but it's actually just a really "clever" meme. /s
---
&gt;TOOK my freaking dog.
---
John Wick time!
---
So you didn't face Balthazar at the Elon Riverlands, then.
---
Okay, so you see how this isn't a celebration then I guess.  Its not celebratory at all they are nearly whispering on the mics, talking only about the past few months of content, have nothing related to a party in the room, ignoring chat, and so on.  Now don't get me wrong, every stream doesn't need to be over the top but their energy and how they present the episode carries onto the viewers and chat.  Hearing about things I've never and will never see doesn't really do anything for me.  If those ~700 enjoy it, then fine but why not do more?  Why not take it a step up and attempt to make something fun?
---
&gt;Let alone crafting 5 Deldrimor Steel Ingo needs 5 days
---
Or you know, 30 seconds on the TP.
---
what did you have pictured in your mind?
---
No, timegates are there to artificially slow down your progress so you don't eat up all the content in one sitting.  It's also Anet's way of giving all players a chance to progress "at roughly the same pace", which is irritating because it caters to Casuals.
---
they are releasing commercials for wow classic again, thats how badly they fucked the future of their main endeavor. We are on a much better, much different path.
---
It's an anniversary stream. The point to celebrating anniversaries is the celebrate what has happened since X began.
---
I.E. My wife and I will not be announcing to ourselves or our family our plans for the next several years of our marriage during our anniversary next week, instead we will be getting a baby sitter and celebrating our time and experiences together.
---
&gt;Do you really think Anet should've release something rough and clunky as that?
---
In what time frame?  After 20 months they should at least be able to do that.  Really they should be able to do a lot better.  But currently, we have nothing.  And even if they release build templates this friday, we still had nothing for 5+ years, and the issue turned players off for 5+ years, and it presumably hurt Anet's profits for 5+ years.
---
Why do you keep replying to me with this comment?
---
Are you for real ? Is reddit actually filled with real people or bots at this point ? How many times do I have to repeat that I already adapt, I already make it much easier to bypass all the CCs and that's not the point of the post, have you even read a single reply i've made to anyone else ?
---
So for the 50th time, i'm not complaining, I'm already doing everything you're saying, so get off your high horse with your godly knowledge of open world mechanics (lul)
---
The point of the post is to question Anet's tendencies to make mobs annoying rather than threatening, which is a valid opinion that no one on this thread has talked about, which is why i get irritated by all the people answering with something that has nothing to do with the discussion itself, like really just read before posting please.
---
When you cook irl it doesnt take you 1 min to cook literally everything. You also dont learn cooking by watching youtube videos for 1 hour and you're done for life. Both of these take some time irl so that time translates into in game time - RP value. 
---
Time gated crafts exist for economy reasons as well.
---
Oh jeez, I didn't realize they weren't account bound/were TP-able!
---
It's steep, but not outrageous. I think I might have to buy it.
---
It's much easier to file a police report and get physical objects replaced than digital accounts.
---
You should progress it as your Chef character.
---
This made JPs tolerable for me.  No longer did I have to do them all on my mesmer lol.
---
The need for additional styling and maintenance is the main reason we've never enabled the mobile layout extension- in essence, nobody was willing to commit to the effort it would take to make it actually look and work well. However, it's been a few years since we've last discussed this topic, so maybe it's time to take a fresh look.
---
donut come for me, because i'll destroy you
---
no one asking the real question of where did you get deez from
---
For reals this! The causal fan base wants everything immediately and will throw a fit if they don’t get it. the reality is things taking time is the natural part of MMO gameplay. It does provide artificial content by extending how long it takes to get it, but adds meat to the other parts of the release. 
---
When HoT came out, the rage storm over the elite specs taking time to unlock was really the start of the downfall of any extended gameplay. Anet caved and adopted the “you can get it almost immediately” so the casual community would STFU and but Gem Store outfits. 
---
I’m sure I’ll get the “I don’t see how time delays are content response.” And a ticket to the reddit dungeon. But that’s the reality of this, when things take time games gain a sense of longevity.
---
Seconded. PoF and LW4 are a lot of fun to play through, and the mounts are great.  I think the way GW2 designed the mounts to work is the best out of any mmo I've played, and definitely worth experiencing.
---
People like that, are awful. what you need is a fellow gw2 player. Way more fun and relaxing staying at home playing gw2 than going to some loud, crowded, smoke filled place, with bad music and over-priced drinks. I'm sure she was pretty, but not all things pretty are good for you. And she obviously wasn't.
---
It could be 5 minutes and the casual community would cry out timegate.
---
As if you could do that with your low dps!
---
Yeah, I mean, that was obvious from the start.
---
issue is that it wasnt enough gems. EH O!!
---
I know this is a late response but no, they are disabled in Belgium, including the free one. Can't get free BL keys when they have them either.
---
Let's say you're 100% right. Let's say OP is an absolute asshole, ignored his GF, consistently prioritized the game over her. Ok? Worst case scenario here.
---
The rational, appropriate response would still not be breaking and entering, destruction of private property, and stealing his damn dog. In no situation is that an appropriate response. It's irrational, psychotic, and illegal. If someone is an asshole and doesn't respect your feelings in a relationship, either talk it out or break up. That's it, FFS.
---
Lewd.
---
It doesnt cater to casuals it caters to economy. Without time gates (on crafting) all of these mats would be worthless.
---
if youre a necro? get in before the meta changes bahaaaaaaaaa. seriously though scourge necros are gross
---
&gt; Look here, he answered every question accurately. That is as good as it gets.
---
The guy literally left out the name of the infusion when the actual effect of the infusion was brought up here.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cw76cx/this_skyscale_skin_was_made_for_me/eyciy0p/?st=jzvm5l0n&amp;sh=842e04f2
---
Being intentionally obscure to egg out questions is not "as good as it gets."
---
&gt;It is you pulling out of your ass that the guy's wrong question 
---
Except its not the wrong question. The idea that he should have automatically known it was an aura is an insanely elitist attitude considering the clusterfuck of cosmetics in the game. 
---
Nothing about the appearance automatically notifies that it is an infusion unless you already know how the infusion looks beforehand.
---
&gt;On top of that he immediately called OP out on the very first response about how he was being snide.
---
Well yes. If I saw someone wearing a glowing lava outfit, and I asked "Hey what armour is that" and the answer I got was "common clothes", I too would think he was mocking me, because common clothes don't tend to be covered in lava.
---
People were defending the time gates because they would result in more content, no joke. The thing is not about wanting loot *now*, it's about being able to progress on someones own pace.
---
We will confront jormag, we will reach the climax of the scene, and then Aurene will come out of no where and eat him.
---
Gold does not grow on trees. \^\^
---
Stick of Cotton Candy's still 10m too.
---
uhhhh wtf.... damn sorry that happened to you. Contact support
---
It's not defending Anet, it's calling out someone for complaining about something that needed to be addressed, and the complaining party lacking the ability to think critically with ascended food on the horizon. If they crafted a bunch in preparation for ascended cooking, why? It makes zero sense to have done so. Were they trying to play the market? Ok, then they have no right to complain because they made the wrong decision and were punished for it. That's literally how investments work.
---
A very GW2 player meme to do.
---
Signed a GW1 player.
---
Yes, Adelbern absolutely made some bad fucking decisions with his stubborn bullheadedness and that won't get any defense from me. But the Charr aren't without fault here.
---
amen
---
Because interns and entry level full time employees also need to learn how to work with the tools.
---
Which is quite irrelevant really. Fact still remains that the only unskippable time-gate is 2 hours.
---
Hey all, Im sure these have been asked before in other independent threads, but just to be sure I'm not insane, I'd like to ask them too:
---
Can varietal seeds be collected from any harvesting node, or herb nodes only?
---
Do I have to use my 500 chef toon in order to collect ascended food ingredients (seeds, meat, etc.) or can I use any toon?
---
Thanks!
---
Wow the OP is very original in this idea. Oooo wow classic turned out good, why not gw2 classic Lololololololol. Nice meme bro.
---
No. Play ff14 Its good.
---
Because I'm curious? I mean if you don't have anything that's fine too man. Some people have trouble expressing their thoughts or imagining changes even if they know they don't like the thing.
---
Both you and Zehf (and some others from what I see) don't know/understand much about the MGTOW movement, if you think it's misogynistic or stands against cohabitation. Ie: you're both idiots.
---
No. No. Play wow classic instead.
---
Seed dropped on the first herb node i gathered. The meat dropped on bears and moas and pretty instantly too.
---
The problem is that when you do that, you are locked to the lowest (or fastest) common denominator. The group that wants their rewards fastest are the ones who determine what it is for everyone else, that's not realistic. And we're talking about an RPG here. No RPG, from PnP to JRPG to Open World RPG to MMORPG gives you everything you want within a couple hours of gameplay. If you want things quickly with only a couple hours of play because that's "All the time you have", then maybe the RPG genre is not the best genre for you as it's meant to have time put into the game to experience the game, not get the shiniest thing the fastest.
---
Never played WoW so the nostalgia factor isn't there
---
And people honestly wonder why Anet don't want to engage with the Twitch side of the community more...
---
Because all ascended have timegate, why are you surprised there is one?
---
That's called Charr propaganda and in no way were they the original, ORIGINAL inhabitants of Ascalon.
---
Factually speaking, Ascalon is a small territory within the lands the Charr inhabit and it is not their "homeland". They originally come from farther north and east.
---
Since when is this happening? I didn't watch anything Guild Wars 2 since about path of fire. And I remember her being thin was really surprised.
---
No times gate makes less flooded market. Everthing is not a plot against you.
---
People who spew this nonsense are obvivious to GW1...
---
Nice to see the Twitch brigade coming out to defend abusing employees for doing their job.
---
Except that at least for the purposes of this meme, The Searing is what put an end to the "thriving human society". All the Foefire did was seal the fate for those still left (hardly thriving or a society at that point).
---
Ah yes, the Charr propaganda line spouted by people who don't know their Charr lore.
---
and they also drops in fractals, in wvw and pve from reward tracks and the crafting material boxes and can so on every living story map that have those boxes you can get for map currency.
---
I agree with you, but we're only hearing one side of this, and it would be unfair and inconsiderate not to consider the whole picture.  If there's anything about claims made on the internet it's that you should always be skeptical.  You never know what's going on in other people's lives, and I don't really think it would be a huge deal to say, "Hey Babe, I'd love to go dancing with you, but I'm feeling a little tired, could we leave early," or something like that.  The main problem I have here is the disrespect..
---
On that note... currently, crafting the Mithrillium required for the Deldrimor Steel Ingot is profitable, providing 1.71 gold more for selling the Ingot at the end than the component pieces cost.  This is obviously inflated a bit by this Cooking stuff, but even before the patch it was still 1.26 gold of profit for doing the daily craft.
---
If you want gold and don't have enough to be able to instantly buy these things, you really owe it to yourself to be crafting these things in advance to earn that gold, or at least to be able to hold onto in your collectibles so that you don't need to worry about these timegates later on.
---
On a similar note, you can make over a gold of profit from the Charged Quartz Crystal you can make daily.
---
Not too mention burninating the countryside.
---
Pretty much why I quit playing GW2. Crap like this. Sadly, one wonders if ANET has played GW1 these days.
---
Good points, especially about the afterlife being more certain that it is in our world.
---
I'll just say that I don't think the history we have of seeing King Adelbern as a good ruler is given to us by an unreliable narrator, since that's straight from ANet's mouth in a summarized fashion.
---
The information regarding the gods and even the source events of the Foefire are all witness accounts.
---
I can't really blame them. I wouldn't be enthused either if I was getting abused on a livestream for doing my job.
---
Anything with tempest works well. You have access to tons of survivebillity and damage to kill shit and cc as well. Which weapon you pick for story is totally what works for you. I prefer staff but sometimes run scepter or dagger/warhorn or focus all depending on what i am fighting in that instance.
---
I just feel like you're trying to troll me and not have a meaningful conversation when you do that.
---
The point is, the stream is far from any kind of celebration.  As nearly everyone in chat was saying, its boring.  Anet needs to be happy and uplifting.  There are a few good questions but Rubi is letting people ramble on too much.  Its not engaging for people to listen to someone talk about things they did nearly a year ago that is only funny or memorable to them.  Sure, insight is nice and hearing about behind the scenes stuff can be interesting but not when it goes so much into becoming an inside joke.  Other than the rambling, Rubi or someone should have done something to the room.  Balloons, streamers, something.  Maybe some fun music playing in the background that's very low as to not go over the guests talking.  Yet none of that is really happening.  Its not engaging yet quite the opposite.  This is one thing many normal, everyday streamers face too.  If you don't keep things interesting, who is going to tune in?  You have to draw people in and hook them.  I don't see any of that with this stream.  Again, it doesn't need to be over the top every stream but this is a multi-million dollar company having their 7th anniversary.  It should feel like that.
---
I judge it based on what I see in /r/mgtow.  I'm comfortable saying it's misogynistic.
---
Thanks a lot that's really hope to know
---
The problem with underwater combat is that you can't telegraph nearly as efficiently without a floor, and judging the distance between you and the mob becomes also a lot more difficult without a floor. Add to that the awkward movement, the fact that it's impossible to ground target, etc... There are so many inconvenient things about the pure concept of underwater combat that ANET really can't make any interesting mechanics for underwater fights. 
---
The best they could do with underwater content is try to make puzzles that are light on combat.
---
Welcome back.
---
you're rude! do you think thats funny?
---
Seriously, even if the company wanted to for PR, I feel like that would be one of the jobs the devs would have to draw straws over. I certainly wouldn't volunteer.
---
Not *specifically* this exact situation, but this is why I've never done a serious relationship. You get all emotionally invested and when things go wrong, best case scenario you both just feel bad about it. Worst case is like this, where you find out how depraved and petty the person you were invested in actually was. I keep people at a distance and get involved casually for that reason. I'm selfish and want my time for me, I consider any time given as an absolute gift if not duly compensated (such as work). And I'm naturally paranoid and untrusting. Feels bad for you, my dude. I don't know how this will affect your future relationships but hopefully you don't resort to being me.
---
I'm not sure why you think OPs complaint is cancerous. They obviously got to 400 cooking by working for it. Now they want to get to 500. They're not getting loot or high end gear. This person is willing to put in the same amount of work as everyone else but for some reason time really matters to you.
---
&gt;Without time gates (on crafting) all of these mats would be worthless.
---
That's assuming everyone maxes out their cooking right away.  A 2 hour timegate does little to maintain prices.  Without gates, some players would try to max out as soon as the update drops.  A majority of players would still take time to level and max cooking.
---
Back on the economy, rich players may *try* to corner the market on uncommon or more rare ingredients, thus raise prices.  So if certain ingredients are already hard to come by through harvesting, I would argue that this is a gate in and of itself, so any additional timegates are not needed.
---
That's fair. I feel like the parts I've been tuning in for have been good energy and more or less interesting but then I just close it out when it gets boring or I need to focus more on what I'm doing.
---
I expect the real anniversary to be this Friday because this is just yet another Guild Chat stream which have always basically just been vlogs, but this one has more guests rotating in than usual.
---
Frankly, if you're not giving someone your full attention when they care enough to shout at you then you're an asshole.
---
A man of culture.
---
They aren't reading the chat though (at least from the 10-15 minutes I saw).  Maybe if the person monitoring chat relayed all the messages people are mentioning then yeah.
---
Raidar has everyone set to private (or squad privacy, I can't remember which) automatically, you have to opt into being public.
---
Way to get mad over a simple question not ditected to you. If you are looking for hard raids its best not to get invested into gw2 just so you can buy two expansions only to realize that 1) Anet will never make anything close to wing 5 again and 2) waiting 9 months for every wing to be released.
---
&gt; Don't you think I might want to bring those two events together (the anniversary and the new launch) in some way, both from a marketing and scheduling point of view? Wouldn't that be the obvious thing to do?
---
They want to celebrate the anniversary on the actual anniversary and they want to do the living world stuff in a way that they can get a big audience, that is, people attending PAX. Doesn't seem that crazy to me. I'm sure at the living world event on Friday they'll mention the anniversary at least, but I think it makes sense to keep the in-person one pretty focused on the actual announcements.
---
Well, you have going to both of those sub-reddits. Enjoy your time there!
---
What I said clearly flew over your head, as I expected it would for the average person.
---
Honestly, purely context/surface level assumptions, 8k hours in GW2, sounds more like addiction then asshole. Breakups suck dude, regardless whatever anyone including myself assumes, I do wish the best to you.
---
"I think I made my answer pretty clear.. btw, would you take my pee bucket with you when you go? Thanks"
---
Guild halls are objectively worse than what we had before.
---
Ahh yes. So they get abused and see the comments, on places like reddit and social media anyway so, somehow, that makes it okay?
---
What point are you trying to make here? "People will see shitty comments so just keep making them" isn't exactly a wonderful stance to make.
---
Toxic comments shouldn't affect anyone ideally, because toxic comments shouldn't be the norm.
---
On a side note, he also made The Sims 3's music and Desperate Housewives, both excellent (and very alike)
---
It's really up to you. There is more than enough in the base game to keep you entertained to level 80, but removing the restrictions can be helpful. While the expansion areas are for level 80's, things like map chat and the extra bag slot are great QOL features at all levels.
---
All things considered though, I would say that if you have already made up your mind to buy a copy of the game, then there is no reason to not go ahead and do it now. If you still need time to make up your mind, nothing wrong with waiting for a bit.
---
People are emotional. Ignoring them only furthers the emotion. This comment section is turning into a real relationship advice thread lol.
---
Timegates are for the "RP" part of "RPG". You "raise" a Skyscale and "learn" to cook from other chefs. RPGs aren't just stat gains, story, and/or new shiny gear/skins.
---
Hello there, are you my lost twin brother?
---
Upgrade once you know you'll stick with the game.  Maybe wait until after Friday, in case they also announce some sales.
---
if you care about your ass only than yeah lol
---
I had similar issues back before the expansions. I tried dagger/dagger and it changed the whole profession completely. No more trying to aim the static aoes to where the mob will stand, or compensate with (long cooldown) cc skills.
---
D/d core elementalist  is a juggler of attunements, constantly on the move, always out of reach. Once I figured out how to play that role I could take on superior force and win.
---
It's not for everyone, but I found it tons of fun. If you like it try the sword weaver for a steroid version ;)
---
I am not the slightest mad but you seem to be stuck in your feelings not realizing it is very different to start the game now then playing it for 7 years and done it all. 
---
Also not all people raid. Some come for PvP and WvW or fractals or just open world. Everybody run their own agenda. And playing htis game and investing time in it is never a loss since you can take time off without falling behind.
---
Yes, because somehow I'm a plutocrat and able to enforce "systematic" issues. Good one.
---
I don’t know that it’s fair to claim Rurik had a better heart than his father.
---
Rurik was a young prince, with none of Adelberns life experiences, and without the pressures of an entire nation on his shoulders. While Rurik was correct, and following him would have potentially saved their people, Adelbern thought he was doing what was best, until the last. To have an entire people abandon what they saw as their homeland? Insanity!
---
If the war had gone differently, and the humans had overcome the Charr, no one would be talking about how brave Rurik was, not how correct his ideals were. He would have been seen as cowardly and radical.
---
The largest thing I think we can *truly* fault Adelbern for is his final living act. But if you remove the Foefire from the equation, his entire people would have just been slaughtered. I honestly doubt he knew full well what he was doing when he cursed his nation the way he did. Unless the sword came with an instruction manual, everything known about it would have been myth and legend.
---
I already understood that you aren't getting it at all, we can stop talking now buddy.
---
And I'm saying that by even asking for the "other side" you're leaving the door open to justifying her actions. It literally does not matter what the reason is. It sounds like OP could have been an inconsiderate boyfriend. It's almost certain that this was not the first time that he gamed instead of going out with his GF. It does not matter. In the absolute worst case scenario, OP should have gotten dumped, not had his shit wrecked. That's why people are sympathizing with him, and that's why your comment sounds like you're blaming the victim.
---
The community always has a choice with how to react. Trying to blame Anet for people acting in a shitty way isn't great imo.
---
I did that and picked up a hero banner. By the time I finished the quests, I was 498 / 500 without really needing to grind craft anything. It was a simple matter of discovering a few things and I was done.
---
See, that's clearly bait but I love it
---
The lack of QA is so apparent I still doubt it. Throw a name card on any random person Ta-da
---
Nothing against you bub, but I have a hard time taking drama threads like this seriously when they only portray one perspective.  It sucks that she's so vindictive, but it makes me curious what you did.  Obviously nothing excuses or justifies revenge, but revenge tends to happen for a reason, and when you leave those reasons blank it makes people like me think you have something to hide.  I don't think that you treated her well, and I don't think she treated you well.  I'd like to think that you don't deserve this, but I don't know you and there's no reason for me not to be skeptical.
---
If you try to force somebody to go out with you to a night club and shout at him, even though he is tired and just want to relax, I think *you* are the asshole. I mean how egoistic can a person be?
---
You could've been making Deldrimor Steel Ingots for years.
---
Somehow I doubt that whatever random forum you're thinking of is much better.
---
shhhhhhh its still good let it happen
---
Did you miss the part where i asked him.what is he looking for in a game. If you want the things i just said its better not to waste your time on GW2 when Anet doesnt put that kind of content as a priority.
---
Why don't you ask him?
---
Imagine to put up squad for his viewers so they can play with him...
---
I can't wait for the "MightyTeapot went to the bathroom" post. I feel like you could make a post about the guy doing anything and it would get traction.
---
That's just an incorrect dude. When someone is upset and irrational, ignoring them only furthers conflict. People are childish and emotional. There's a name for someone who doesn't have emotions, it's sociopath.
---
Now, I'm not going to make assumptions about a situation that I know nothing about, other then the side observation that 8k hours in a game is a lot. 
---
But to be clear, ignoring somebody who is acting irrational only escalates the situation.
---
&gt; You cannot cherry pick real-life ethical defenses for a fantasy-based world if it, again, only suits you
---
Well, you were the one using real life politics to characterize me, so why cant I use real life ethical defenses?
---
this gun be good
---
"misandry"
---
*rolls eyes*
---
It also could be a trend. If this is the way she often reacts, it’s not just when she’s truly upset. When it’s that commonplace, anyrhing can often set it off, and it can be better to ignore it. Saying anything can often make it worse, no matter what it is.
---
I’ve dealt with people in both categories. Ignoring sucks, but if some is overly emotional and blows up over everything like that, there honestly isn’t much you can do.
---
Forgal's words to the Warmaster/Commander are certainly inspirational and touching. I'll never forget what he said to the Vigil recruit prior to his defiant last stand against Blightghast:
---
&gt; **Warmaster Forgal Kernsson:** I lost my mate and children to the dragons. I thought my legend was buried with them, that I had no one to walk in my footsteps and tell my tale.  
---
&gt; **Warmaster Forgal Kernsson:** Now that's changed, my friend. Thank you for being my legacy. Tell my tale at the hearth fires, where the skaalds sing of heroes.  
---
&gt; **Warmaster Forgal Kernsson:** Go. I will not fail.  
---
I'd love it if Jormag actually had Forgal's mate and the Spirit of Dolyak/Ox as corrupted Icebrood champions while we visit the fallen homestead of the last Dolyak Shaman to add salt to the wound for all Vigil players, especially if this champion was also intelligent and quite reasonable (as far as Icebrood go) yet it'd be pretty horrific to think we're talking with Forgal's mate who is now all about praising Jormag and spreading the Ice Dragon's gospel of survival of the fittest. Even better if said mate actually complimented the Vigil Commander and said how it's clear why Forgal cared for us like his own child and that it's an honor for the mate to fight side by side with us against Dragon's enemies (in case we need to side with Jormag for a while against Primordus etc. in a deal with the devil since Jormag should be the only Elder Dragon we can theoretically reason with as the Dragon prefers corrupting willing converts). Imagine all the drama and a complex hero-villain relationship. :)

&gt; Cursed Shore | [&amp;BBsDAAA=] Rental is south east of the waypoint, rift is just a bit east of that.

Imagine if they only talk about Living Story for 45 minutes.
---
Thank you for the answer guys, i'll wait for a bit then :) i still have a lot to do in the game anyways
---
&gt; -if we were in a relationship and I was shouting at you, would you put down what you're doing and give me your full attention?
---
Nope I would put headphone in until you acted like a reasonable adult as dating children is illegal for people my age. 
---
In all seriousness though I have left gvgs before due to yelling in my apartment hallway let alone someone actually apart of my life.
---
Reminds me of a video of some spiteful girl who deleted her boyfriend's WoW characters because he had to take time to do a raid.
---
Snooooow! Bundle up fellas, things are gettin chilly!
---
In the comment above, in context of previous comments.
---
I got timeouted for posting OSFrog.
---
Nah, dude.  You're complaining hard.  You're saying that the Griffons and whatever else are increasing the amount of time it takes to do your farming route.  People tell you to do things differently -- either cleanse, or CC, or SOMETHING -- so you don't have so much trouble and you're fighting with everyone because *they're not telling you what you want to hear.*
---
How about this?  What if there was no CC but then the toughness was pushed through the roof?  Does that make it more threatening since you'll have to burn through cooldowns sooner to fight an ultra-tanky mob?  Do you want them to freeze you *then do 600% damage to frozen foes* to make it more challenging?  I seriously can't make heads or tails of your complaint.  You don't offer a solution.  You're offering a complaint.  Complainer.
---
I knew it, OP was a toxic raider /s
---
Who fucking cares that his games MIGHT not be in future games, why is that so much more important than refusing to give him money, status and support that enables him to manipulate and abuse women who idolize him?
---
&gt; I almost never close the game
---
sounds like an addiction
---
I don't know for sure but I think it's 3 max. I'd get the free one before buying the paid one to be safe.
---
There are some promo items on the in-game store right now, and there is a big announcement regarding the Living World this Friday. It's possible they might put the games on sale. Best to follow them on twitter or their FB page
---
Taking credit? Wtf?
---
The story is that all the characters were deleted. That's an extremely unique situation, and OP is showing the oddity that happens when such a thing occurs.
---
Taking credit would be posting this as **"Game is EZ. Check my stats.  Almost 8k hours and zero deaths. Suck it, noobz."**
---
But no, they told us the context and pointed out how it affected their stats. That's not "taking credit."
---
Probably soon. This was tweeted and then removed yesterday. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cw7c47/deleted_tweet_maybe_incoming_sale/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=sharei
---
It's basically a meme about streams and communication in general. Had they answered questions, they would have avoided substantive questions and focused on things like Quaggans instead.  
---
Communication is so poor that it takes literal years for even basic questions to get answered.
---
Weird how you're so skeptical of a woman's claim that Jeremy Soule is a rapist, (now corroborated by another) saying she should go to the police instead of posting about it online, but you have absolutely no trouble believing a crazy ex-GF broke into a man's house and deleted their GW2 characters, with even less proof, nor do you have a problem with them posting it online, and you even jump to defend the person despite not even knowing if it even happened.
---
While this kind of rage tends to stop "creative" thinking, you should also look into taking steps to secure your identity, credit cards, bank account etc.  There is a chance anything else she was able to access via saved passwords has also been compromised.  
---
All bets are off when dealing with anyone willing to take it to this level.
---
This sub is gonna burn :3
---
I got timeouted for saying "This is incredibly boring ResidentSleeper" so I think you were lucky. Frogs are serious.
---
The thing is, WoW evolved. It is a very, very different game now, for better or worse.
---
Gw2 didn't really evolve, it just grew a lot of QOL and had a content/feature creep (which is usually clearly separable from the old stuff). So even now you can just use core traitlines (admitely a lot of them are way more focused now) and crappy gear and go do core map exploration/dungeons, it would be pretty close.
---
The only thing that would work as "gw2 vanilla" is some kind of ls1 rehash.  Guess some people would like that.
---
so she turned her shitty relationship issues into a triple felony
---
nice
---
Doubt for one thing they'd have to cut out major spoilers that'd be a 10 minute presentation. Also its likely Z presenting it as game director and other devs will be around for interviews and to talk to fans but thats just a guess on my part.

---
RIP, this will be 2am or so for me.

thx;3

Should I just go ahead and buy the expansions? I've been holding out for an anniversary sale but it looks like it isn't going to happen.
---
Don't feed the troll.
---
&gt;  YOU GOTTA CHOOSE: GO OUT WITH ME OR STAY PLAYING THAT KIDS GAME
---
That stuff never ends good later down the line. First the game, than your friends, than your parents, than your wallet, your dignity and humanity.
---
No, but considering your claims, you have to be able to substantiate them. Considering your supposed intelligence, that should be incredibly easy for you to do in a quick, easy to divulge manner.
---
I have. I’ve looked at their claims before, and while many of their goals aren’t a bad thing at all, the movement as a whole is ignoring those and choosing to stay angry. There’s no growth in anger- but it’s a fast an easy dopamine hit. It’s a lot easier to revel in your anger over supposed injustices than it is to change your reality in order to actually be happy.
---
A quick scan through posts just prove that. There’s almost no personal growth happening between individuals- it almost always becomes a circle jerk of talking about injustices and how it’s much it’s affected them... but there’s almost no talk of how to grow from there. There’s no talk of how mental illness from trauma/horrible experiences can change your brain chemistry and you have to be incredibly proactive in fixing that to feel happy again.
---
The whole idea of the movement is to go your own way and be your own person. Which is great! Everyone should do that- be the person that makes you happy, not society happy. The problem is that it doesn’t follow through. If you want to learn to be your own person, happy with yourself, you need to let go of anger, not surround yourself with it. You need to learn new things and gain new hobbies. And not because you want to do it to fuck over some woman who wronged you, which is the common thing people say- because that just means you aren’t going your own way. You’re trying to live the past out in the present.
---
an equilibrium?
---
...
---
May I see it?
---
Ugh ... too soon. I'll probably forget about this by the time it starts.
---
Player Housing
---
We still don’t know if it’s true. If it is, I don’t want him in future projects at all, but if it isn’t, these allegations are enough to keep him from working on any other project which would be a shame
---
Depends on the circumstances really. If you're just unable to get off the game because you're so hooked on it, yeah, it is a problem for sure, but you are absolutely allowed to focus on gaming sometimes.
---
Since youre used to FPS I recommend Looking up the Action cam GW2 offers - I rarely ever Play without it now
---
Hey another dude not reading, no i'm not complaining, yes i did offer options.
---
I don't mind if they have some hard CCs, but make it meaningful, how about the mob actually killing you if you are too careless and get caught in too much CC ? Because right now if i get ice blocked for 10s, i'm nowhere near death, I just stand there and take useless hits with no counterplay possible, all that to make the experience obnoxious.
---
Now if the mobs were actually capable of killing me when I literally do nothing, maybe the danger would make me consider the mechanics to be there for a reason, like "hey if you get CCed you're in trouble so be careful", but no it's just "hey you're gonna get CCed, better bring a pillow !".
---
From where I see it, it seems like Anet is scared to make mobs dangerous for the casual playerbase in open world (which is fine), but then resort to useless timestalling to make you play longer doing the most mundane tasks, a little bit like the timegating they like to add on every single thing these days.
---
Oh and again, I already do everything you say, i'm not frustrated by the situation, I farm my winterberries without any problem, my point is once again (because you all seem to be lacking in the braincells department to understand it) is that there might be another way less anoying and just as demanding of the player to make the experience better.
---
Context is everything
---
Oh, thank you!!!
---
No
---
You spelled "she sounds like a cunt" wrong.
---
don't forget damage sponge fractal bosses
---
Try caring about someone enough to know that "I don't want to go out tonight" doesn't cause a fucking argument.
---
or you go and do the other sections ...
---
As someone with multiple accts (Core, F2P, HoT/PoF), I'd say it's worth it for Path of Fire (you can buy the xpacs separately and you get a free lvl 80 boost per xpac, though you should save it). You can ask someone to run you through the first mission for PoF so you can get your mount, and that will make leveling SO MUCH FASTER. Once you hit level 80 though, that's where F2P starts getting difficult. Exotic gear, which is normally *fairly* cheap to buy from the Auction House, is harder to come by as a F2P (WvW is probably one of the most realistic sources).  AND you dont have access to Superior Sigils/Runes (you do, but only from drops), which make the endgame experience a lot more difficult.
---
Using the position rewinder makes them a bit more forgiving, but I find JPs insanely frustrating.  Especially when trying to use my Norn toon.  If there weren't specific achievements tied to them that are needed for other things, I wouldn't do them at all.
---
Thats the whole reason he posted that screen shot...cause she deleted all of them and now it says he has 0 deaths.  Like it went so far over your head you got insulted.
---
This is only extra funny because I'm a thief main since a couple of weeks after release.
---
Some free advice as an older gamer to a younger one. Go to the club, look for another girl. You will have plenty of time to game until you die. You can game until you're old and grey . There is only a small window in your life where clubbing is fun and appropriate. Enjoy it while it lasts

---
John Smith works in mysterious ways.
---
I guess you either have never had a relationship before or a lot of bad ones, a good relationship requires both attention and privacy. Shouting is not caring, jealousy is not love. If he was tired, if he didn’t wanted to go out that night she should have understood that. But instead she was trying to force him to go, maybe they could have deal with the situation better but if the girl was so easy pushed into shouting and mistreating his boyfriend property then she clearly has anger management issues and he dodged a really troublesome bullet right there.
---
OP doesn't sound like a charming person either tbh. you do not ignore your partner when they're upset.
---
Just in time for my drive home from work, WP you magnificent bastard.
---
It's almost as if streamers pushing certain opinions and perspectives consistently for the past few months might have made things worse...
---
It’s pretty easy to remove all the disruptive YouTube chat when there is nobody using chat on YouTube in the first place.
---
But it's almost midnight so it will turn back into a cute lovely mogwai then.
---
It would kind of work if they made large scale Stronghold maps with 1, 2 and 3 lanes and proper moba rules, kind of like the maps in Heroes of the Storm. The current stronghold map is way too small for that.
---
But they would have to give a default mount for players without PoF.
---
Same in WvW. They need to add something like a mount rental, a sidecar, a pulling cart, a pillion saddle or a 'spirit mount' for slot #9 that players can use on an ally to lend them a mount for as long as they stay close enough.
---
this looks way cooler than that from shaman^^
---
I would watch that until the end without sleep, but I have to put the human flesh suit, cross the threshold, exchange some platinum for cash, and go charge the pre-paid debit card I use to buy gems to get the Supply Drop Requisition.
---
he died a lot and was jealous she never did.
---
Not sure. Glint's Legacy was about finding multiple benevolent replacements that share magic between themselves, with no ill effects on the world. Aurene is just one such replacement. Unless we get some new lore on magic, this will be a retcon, that actually will sting me a little.
---
There should be a tick box in the options menu related to mounts. Sorry, on mobile and don't know the exact toggle offhand

new dungeons

I thought the same thing reading your exchange.

Llamas when?

Ey, what about the mesmers who port the complicated stuff like ember Bay or not so secret for achievements or collections :'(   :p

Hope you called the police, filed a report, and had that crazy bitch thrown in jail; she'll soon find out that Ladies Night being every night is going to get old on night one along with the prison hooch and Whippet Surprise.

Ye, that one is nicely done; quite easy to figure out yet it takes some time to complete :)

Wow, more players feeling the same way :D

BATTLE LLAMAS with layers on their frigging heads, the perfect mount to bring back that pirate ship wvwvw game play!

If he lost all his characters. it's 0 deaths now as they count per character.

Should have posted a surprised hylek face instead.

You can also use the miniature tonic haha
---
My wife used to yell at me too, but she would never have done some dumb shit like that. She used to play with me, still does to play fashion wars. She got burnt out of the actual game. When in a relationship you need to find a balance, and you both need to understand that you both need down time to do the things you enjoy. She enjoys laying down and cuddling and falling asleep binge watching shows or going out to try new stuff wheather its food or an activity. I enjoy it too, but I think over time (11 years and 1 year of marriage) we learned to respect each other more and more. We hardly fight, because of this.
---
And yet she knew your GW password. Better change all your passwords and watch you're credit cards.
---
&gt;RP reasons 
---
In your other reply, you said cooking IRL takes time, so having the timegate on cooking makes sense.  Ok, if you put it that way, then should we have to walk the map instead of use waypoints?  In the real world, we need to walk or drive between cities.
---
Thanks! It was way at the bottom so I hadn’t seen it.
---
Wanted to be the GW2 version of WoW's pacifist panda.
---
or since it was in his house and she broke in, she just got on his computer and he had his password saved in the client.
---
&gt; As someone mentioned, it's there simply for RP reasons, just like growing a skyscale.
---
So where are all the time gates for the story missions? afaik there isnt a single one for any story mission in gw2.
---
&gt; have you never been on those kind situations? Where you pretty much accept a lot of bad stuff because you have ONE THING that is REALLY REALLY GOOD? 
---
That's exactly what victim of domestic violence would say. It's not because you're a man you can't be a victim.
---
I think we're absolutely on the same page, and just debating language at this point.
---
Bringing it back to the context of this thread, OP continued to engage in the activity that was causing the anger in the first place, and did nothing to even acknowledge the other person's existence.
---
"...there are times where staying quiet (with maybe some nodding or brief “uh-huhs” is better in the moment. Occasionally, ignoring the situation or leaving the room is still the best action, even if it has ramifications to it too."
---
This isn't the same thing that OP did at all. What he described sounded intentionally inflammatory. Ignoring so as to win, in a way. "I'm not going to talk to you to punish you for acting irrationally." kind of thing.
---
Atleast, that's how I interpreted it. There wasn't much to go on lol. As I said, language. In addition to OP's language, there was also the parent comment.
---
"I have to disagree, even if only because I don't want to be an asshole. The more you shout at me, the less attention you get."
---
That kind of blanket statement is just not correct.
---
Imo as I said, these things are very intuitive and ingrained in human nature. Based off the way you phrase your sentences and thoughts online, the language and structure you use, I see mediation and de-escalation. After all, there's a reason all your friends come to you the way the do. Then, I see the way OP's and the parent commenter phrased their thoughts, and I really see it as more of wanting to take a stand, to make a point. 
---
There are some people that are just naturals at calming others. It's like at a bar, when a guy is making a scene, and bouncer comes up to them and says, you know, "I get it, tell me about it over there, it's too loud, yeah they sound like an asshole." etc. Then there's the big burly dude who just grabs the guy and takes him out. I'm not that first bouncer, I'm not like you are now, I don't naturally resort to talking somebody down. I'm a very arguementative and stubborn person, it's my jewy side lol. For me, I always need to think about ways to keep people and myself calm when in a conflict. And I'd argue that people making statements like "The more you shout at me, the less attention you get." are like that too.
---
I used to do them all on my Necromancer for the same reason. Spectral walk is a godsend for learning the ins and outs of all jumps.
---
Hunting down those damn coins in the silverwastes...ugh. It must have saved me thousands of silver in missed jumps that would have led me to my death from falling.
---
I mean. Tell that to the Seers.

Gw2 has height advantage for all projectiles. Very noticable as ranger shooting downhill from a tower: the effective range feels like it's around 2500.
---
Dont you guys have smart watches ?
---
i am proud of you
---
Asura also are completely lost without their wits.
---
Apply confusion to a charr, you get: *"I can't remember my orders."* No big deal.
---
Apply confusion to a human: *"What's going on?"* Perfectly reasonable.
---
But oh man, you apply confusion to an asura: *"Where am I?"* And I can't stress how hopelessly baffled they sound.
---
Yeah, as much as being matched with an abusive, violent psychopath is bad for anyone. 
---
Why are you acting like they're both at fault LMAO
---
No.7 (starting at 15:30) is quite interesting and something I've been thinking about since we heard the words "expansion like content first": What if there are no new expansions planned, and all the content is delivered in seasons?
---
Season 4 clearly showed what is possible within a season (thinking about victories over Liches and Dragons, new mounts etc.)
---
It's quite possible that all those expansion marketing isn't worth it if the gemstore-sales are good enough, as WP mentioned, too. At this point I can't see why a season shouldn't come with a lot of features or even take us to new horiozons or even continents.
---
I wish I have over 10k gold on my account. : /
---
I'd like to see a streamer making a legit hylek emote and then watch Anet hitting themselves in confusion.
---
Story missions are divided in instances. The time between those instances may as well be one month.
---
It shouldn't be particularly shocking to you. The vast majority of people offline find transexuals bizarre at best, and disgusting at worst. It's a very common opinion even though it's not polite to express it.
---
That's the whole point my man, you bring them back down to a rational position.
---
Lore wise, sure Rurik was cool, good guy ultimately responsible for the hero of Prophecies going to Kryta and essentially putting this whole universe into motion.
---
But did you fucking play when his AI was just straight up suicidal?  Fuck Prince Rurik and all of my time he wasted on those missions.  It still makes me so angry just thinking about it.
---
But in that case weavers are far stronger, dealing 10k to 20k dps (effectively taking one player out every second or two) if not pressured.
---
Tables, to go with 500 cooking obviously
---
They can also just restore the Charakters in thier state when they were deleted.
---
 When I think about it, deleting characters in Gw2 is some sort of Cyro- thing.
---
Halloween coming soon to re-supply us with more salvage fodder. I'll actually be happy to see these foods drop from bags this year. My gardens need the compost.
---
He deleted his original comment because it made him look bad.
---
Jesus Christ, just how much Guild Wars 2 do you play justify that? /s
---
Most if not all the ones who are complaining about the game atm are people who have completed most of the content and only do stuff like raids, wvw and pvp. Because for new players there is enough content to last years. 80% of my game time is dedicated to wvw and pvp as well but I play for limited time so I don't  really have a problem + I do have some in game goals to work with.
---
Now compare this with someone who plays 4-5+ hours everyday and only does raids, pvp and wvw. They are bound to have the stagnant feeling. Even when I find the story really good and play it, I do it once and then leave, and as I said since I pve less  we maps don't hold me there for too long. 
---
While new expansion would be good and I think enough of a hype announcement, I really do wish they give something for the wvw and pvp community as well. I'm not expecting much but a release or update on the Alliance project for wvw and maybe that swiss tournament for pvp they talked about before will help. I dunno if it will be enough but I really hope at least something is given.
---
You're playing a fantasy game though. Not everything needs to have its IRL equivalent example.
---
Wouldnt gardening in game lose its value if you could harvest your crops any time you wanted because "it's just a game"? Time gates exist to give some sense and value to certain things, but I do agree that some time gates are obnoxious when they are too long for no reason.
---
What the fuck
---
Do people seriously expect that to happen?
---
I mean surely this comment is satire right?
---
I would recommend to you, your wife and anyone that feels the same way as you do about time gates to exercise your own free will and choose to slow down and smell the roses a bit more when playing. Forcing time gates like in the skyscale collection on players is always a a bad thing. Games should allow more freedom and less (from a developer)play when we want you to and how we want you to.
---
I am sorry you feel I am trying down playing your opinion thats not what I am trying to do. I apologize for that. You made a point I had not heard before about timegate being for RP reasons. I thought about it for a minute and thought it was if timegates were really for RP reasosn why isnt there more of it in the game already and what you take on that might be, with some potential examples of what it could look like.
---
I said many months ago that PoF was maybe the last boxed expansion and season 5 will introduce a new way to release content.
---
no one believed me.
---
That's why I like e.g. ember bay and not so secret the most: They have both a certain difficulty and multiple reasons to return (legendary collections; mursaat tokens to collect; diving goggles) and due to their layout (into height rather then covering a huge distance) offer good collaborative possibilities e.g. to guide ppl, port them, or also for natural collaboration evolving while doing the JP. We oftentimes see players who by chance already formed small groups and got to know each other while jumping in there -&gt; In summary, despite or even **because** of their difficulty and frustration levels those JPs offer a nice spot to get to know others and by this serving the community very well!
---
im hyped ladies and gents
---
Why do they hate frogs?
---
Yeah, they in fact very specifically AVOIDED even mentioning templates beyond "we won't ban you for using ARC templates" until they were finally ready to tell us they have actually been working on them a couple months back.
---
Yeah my joke didn't land, thanks for pointing it out
---
This is what Drooburt has been building towards all these years.
---
Ah, but you see... people complained about those tasks and called them "grind", which Anet PROMISED to keep out of their game. Btw, reddit &amp; forum seem to call everything even slightly repetitive "grind", I wish they all played some older asian mmos for a month to see what REAL grind is....
---
So what is there left for Anet? If they add something to DO, then people complain its grind, too difficult, needs access to other ls content... pick one. If they DONT add something to do, then people complain about "unnecessary" timegates.
---
If anet makes all mats accountbound to regulate the economy, people are mad because its accountbound and they cant buy their way towards the goal. If they make it timegated but not account bound, people complain about timegate.
---
Im really NOT an Anet fangirl. Im one of those constantly harping how the game got turned into a shallow mobile game for PC. But truthfully, the community is also at LEAST partly at fault here. If people would stop complaining about every.little.thing. then maybe we would now still have an mmo worth logging into.
---
With everything we have got till now I'm pretty certain about Jormag, maybe will contain Primordus too. The email they sent before also had snowy theme + the suspicious travellers added to shiverpeaks in the recent patches almost confirms it.
---
I was hoping for more as this was an anniversary stream. It is nice to bring in the devs to talk, but it got boring really quickly. They didnt speak about milestones, didn´t release interesting numbers and facts about the game (and I don´t mean spoilers here), no giveaways and overall no birthday party atmosphere. This sadly felt more like a normal Dev talk than a special occasion.
---
speaking of, do primers work with the ascended feasts?  Has anyone tested?
---
and contact police for someone breakin in your house
---
I am good with canned WvW food for life... Loading from Armistice Bastion in some idiotic instance to plant food every day... nah
---
...but... I... believed!
---
Just as surface level as your opinion is. We have access to the same information. I just needed to defend myself using language like that because I know I'm an MMORPG sub and this is a volatile subject for the people here. Kinda upsetting you used it against me.
---
I think it's a perfectly fair assumption, and the norm, that somebody who put 8k hours into a game, and who just ruined a relationship because of it (not saying anything about her, just OP), is engaging in said game in excess. And most likely addicted. The one phrase that you chose to not quote from my comment was "I'd argue your situation is an outlier." At this point, you might just think you're an outlier.
---
Addiction to anything is not the time to assume the best in people. If there's a 1% chance that OP (or maybe you) might read this now, and in the future stop right before you're downloading the next MMORPG and go "Hm, maybe I shouldn't." then that's a great thing. In this instance, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong and maybe I hurt some feelings. I'm willing to take that. Just being nice and assuming the best, when looking at the situation (again, 8k hours, ruined relationship, note you tried to change the example to hundreds of hours), has no benefit.
---
i hate both of the volcanic jumping puzzles, i dont like puzzles where you don't see the path, where to jump. not so secret is nice because the platforms are there. my favourite one is the siren's landing JP becayse it's looooong and focuses on JUMPING instead of gliding to "guess where" locations.
---
What is going on?
---
I was thinking the same, somehow I feel like they want to transition into a LS = expacworthy content. Include stuff like we got now into the game and add it with the LS and try to keep retention that way. Now I don't say that it isn't financially viable but with a room full of players on site I think this would be a bad idea and I suspect that people will be really discontent with that.
---
I mean as long as they add more guild content, more raids/fractals cms, WvW content, sPvP content, instead of only Living World content, I think no one would bat an eye. 
---
This is why so many people are worried, xpacs usually means a big lot of content (even tho since HoT this is no longer the case, PoF was a glorified living world patch).
---
It also doesn't help that anet doesn't understand how twitch works and how they need to deal with this behaviour.
---
I know right?
---
An expansion is just a condensed living world.
---
Sadly, it's almost certainly just because they forgot to whitelist them as "usable in raid instances".
---
I actually really like pumpkin spice cookies and peppermint ice cream as cheap open world foods.
---
Is there a reason the third guy to the left has no pants?
---
They should just turn on sub chat only Kappa
---
Yeah this is where a lot of people are at the moment. We know from ex-devs that ANet was working on other shit and essentially getting the Living World team to bust their asses to make it look like the studio was fully supporting GW2. There was a point where S4 was going to be the end of Guild Wars 2, but they then got the green light for S5. The layoffs ended up a net gain for GW2 with more people coming from the cancelled projects than the number who were fired.
---
It really has me scratching my head as to what they could be doing. On the one hand, there's a lot of room for it to be really underwhelming because of all the turmoil and lack of direction. On the other hand, the Living World team created a godly amount of content on a skeleton crew. Could they really have made something insane with the time they got since the layoffs and a big influx of devs going back to GW2?
---
Me: Ha, that would be funny if that subreddit actually exists.
---
Also me: Oh, it actually does exist. Huh...
---
no pug group is bothering with going out, together all on the same map, also most pug groups are gathered over time some some are in already some not
---
Underwater weapons as land weapon elite specs for half the classes, other half gets off-hand.
---
Jormag is the main antagonist, well build up through S5 to the expansion probably called Heart of The Storm.
---
Player housing which is basically guildhall system but on a smaller scale and new houses later on in the gem store only.
---
Core mesmer and chronomancer are in a bad spot right now. Removal of instant chrono shatter severely gimped it's potential- limiting it to veil for stealth, gravity well and curtain pull. There are a few viable mirage builds for both roaming and group play.
---
Played correctly,  Soulbeast should be as able if not more so than mirage.
---
If it's anything less than an expansion it will be a disaster
---
This is literally the reason why I stopped playing. You are a mush of orange textures.
---
that's what gw2 teaches you early on
---
I know you have received a lot of downvotes, /user/Chickenooble, but I want to say that your advice is sound. Of *course* it's entirely possible that the OP's ex was really unstable and the OP did the best he could to be a good boyfriend (or husband, or whatever). On the other hand, it's also possible that the ex is so over the edge in part because of things the OP did in the relationship, or something else altogether may be true.
---
The reality is that we, the readers of reddit who have nothing to go on other than a few sentences written by one party in this incident, just don't know, so given the general theme and details that he *has* reported, "if a game is causing trouble in your relationships you should think about if there's a problem with how you are treating the game" is good advice. The guy might play an hour a week and have no problem whatsoever, and if so then when he thinks about the place of the game in his life he can say, "no, an hour a week is fine." If he does have a problem, hopefully he would realize it. 
---
It's good advice.
---
Franky is going for that cool beachboy look. Hawaiian shirt and swim trunks are all a ~~men~~ &gt;!cyborg !&lt;needs in life :)

&gt; Kappa.

I don't think we'll get Cantha. And afaik Kappas don't live anywhere else in Tyria.

Does cold wind sound different that warm or temperate winds?

This is gonna be a nightmare, no questioning that
---
&gt; last the weekend playing the game, cause i was tired and didnt had will to go out she rants like crazy about me not wanting to go into a night club with her saturday, i was literally ignoring her and playing the game while she was screaming at me, then she goes eve
---
yeah, no, the game is not the reason why this ended. While video games can be very, very addicting, this does not seem to be the problem here.  
---
my partner has never played video games, and has no desire to ever do so. but she respects that this is what I like to do in my freetime.   
---
This does not have to be a long post here. Just saying you did the right thing. If a partner ever says " this thing, or me" - point to the door. thats not gonna be healthy relationship.  
---
well done, sir,. Your toons should be back in no time
---
It's evolving into a dolphin
---
Only if you have no idea of MMORPGs or addictions. 
---
It's just lazyness. Sometimes I start the game and do literally nothing there. In the evening I see that I got kicked for being AFK for too long and I close the game. 
---
It's just the same as leaving your favorit website open (facebook, instagram, youtube, netflix, whatever) or your TV turned on. It's just a convinience to have it ready when you need it instead of waiting for the page to load / the game to start / turning on the TV. It just saves time and since there are no additional costs or anything when you leave several tabs/games open, there are no disadvantages.
---
That will not be the title of the next expansion.
---
Yeah, people *have* been getting a yearly expansion, just parceled out. The belief that they're somehow being short changed has always been nonsense.
---
&gt; sex with crazy ppl usually is AMAZING
---
First thing I thought while reading your previous posts.  "OP must have been getting some good sex to put up with such a crazy person."
---
Not really, Human female meta ftw
---
Sometimes you do. It just depends on the situation.
---
Sound design is actually really powerful, and although we don't always notice it (like in film, where we have visual cues to give us context), it can actually stand on its own really well.
---
Usually, wind in general is associated with things being colder, though there are ways to make it more distinct in one direction or another, temperature-wise.
---
Warm air sound often resembles the sound of steam, with higher pitches being emphasized. Generally wind isn't used in "hot" scenes in movies because it's more powerful to convey heat when the air is absolutely dead still. If it does, going back to the idea of steam, it's when there's a specific source of heat being highlighted.
---
Cold air sound often focuses on lower pitches, though it can also be really pronounced if made to sound like its traveling through something hollow, giving it just the slightest echo. For some reason, that conveys "cold" to us subconsciously.
---
That's a dolphin
---
It all depends on the person, I've talk w/ my bf about it and when he's upset he wants to be left alone. Ill check in on him for dinner and such, but when he's had a bad day, he doesn't wanna be interacted w/. Honestly communication is key to any relationship, but that still shitty that OP was given an ultimatum, that's just a toxic relationship.
---
I've seen a station like this in the wild maybe...Twice? 
---
Not even used that much because everyone has different builds
---
She broke into his house, shattered everything that was glass, and slashed his tires, and stole his dog. I wouldn't suggest the police very lightly, but this is beyond the line I would draw.
---
The funny thing is that there is just another thread today where the one ignoring his hysterical girlfriend gets all the praise praise for doing so.
---
GF feels neglected because BF doesn't do what she wants and tries to sabotage his life: 'OMG file a case and jail her!'
---
Players feel neglected because Developers don't do what they want and try to sabotage their game: 'Well they get what they deserve.'
---
Being afk can account for quite an amount of time... trust me...
---
Someone needs to give the stream Alacrity so this counts down faster
---
Judging by your girlfriend's actions I think the marked portion might change very soon.
---
Ex's be cray cray.
---
&gt; and include Primordus.
---
All things considered - updates and datamining - I'd go for Steve instead.
---
Truffle Steak is shook
---
Mounts and elite specs made PoF. Without them there was nothing special about the expansion.  
---
HoT's main features were the introduction of the mastery system, elite specs, and raids that followed.  
---
Going forward into LWS5 they need similar advancements to the game. Another batch of elite specs. Something game-changing like mounts and gliding. New game formats such as a new style of instanced content for PvE, a structured version of WvW built for competitive GvG, and something like Hero's Ascent from GW1 to breathe new life into PvP.
---
With as quickly as this map generates new IP addresses, it should not take too long before there is a fresh map to try.
---
Playable Kodan and new elite specializations. At least one of these two must become reality.
---
Not necessarily, especially in newer releases. There's usually some open world requirement before you can get into next instance so it works as a soft and bearable timegate.
---
The issue with older dungeons was that it was unreasonable to untangle them to update. Maybe time showed that new ones would be in demand.
---
because youre only hearing one side of the story. and both parties make themselves look better than they are.
---
Yea, 4am for me :'(
---
What I fear is that they will promise "expansion like" seasons on somewhat of a schedule but yet again not be able to deliver in a timely manner. They might promise every three months but it slips to every four, five, etc. Just like what happens with living world, not ready in time, not enough staff, etc. Soon!
---
Wollay has better communication than Anet.
---
Nice.
---
I swear to god if they're doing all this just to *only* announce the LS and nothing else the disappointment will destroy this game.
---
HOT completely redid fractals, had promised new legendaries, added the mastery system, added raids, and a new class. They are way more than living world content.
---
/r/guildrecruitment, find yourself a guild, that should be a good starting point
---
Not even fractals, look at LS updates. Every update we get living story dungeons that are meant to be played solo. If Anet could re-purpose them to turn them into dungeons that would be a *ton* of content they could pull from.
---
O man
---
When will people understand that too much hype can lead to devastating disappointment ...
---
I just checked mine, it also said 0 deaths until I hit refresh.
---
I'm not quite sure this guy is serious about no deaths, especially if he raids.
---
I was so confused why people say Kappa after only knowing the gw Kappas.
---
Mine said 0 until I refreshed the page. I'm doubtful he's serious about the 0 deaths.
---
Sounds like a bad match to me. When I was dating my wife in the past, I made it clear that I play a lot of games and she understands this. So I get my gaming time, as well as make time for her. I don't need to pick one or the other.
---
&gt; the #1 reason why players buy the expansions.
---
That seems a bit of an over-generalization, no? Otherwise it'd be 'Elite Packs, new story content included'.
---
&gt;  is there really a need for new spec for running around and afking in metas
---
you do realize you are playing GUILD WARS, not pong online, right?
---
Yep you should, had somone in my guild delete all his characters and even though that was incredibly  stupid he was able to get them back. Probs to Anet for having back ups.
---
The firsst ones wont, after you get the collection item it will drop for other characters.
---
I don't know how this usually goes but the last dev interaction I saw had a CM declare themselves leader of the office until the CEO threw a shoe at them.  Granted, it's been a while, but it was far more alive than this.
---
If you're a free to play player, you're more limited in your interaction. This is to prevent gold seller spam.
---
You can only whisper people who have added you to your friends list and you can't talk in map chat at all.
---
If you're on a US server, send me your name, I'll add you, and can help you with some of the stuff you might not know yet.  My in game name is Vayne.8563 but you can't actually add me without  me adding you, or at least you can't whisper me without me adding you.
---
We do get a hint kind of in battle with Kralky. He says that those same energies that are conflicted in him, tearing him apart are in full harmony inside Aurene, so maybe that will be the link. I do remember theories about Mother Tree stepping in for Mordy, but I'm not sure if this will happen
---
obviously this sucks but.. why could she get into your computer? I get saving your GW2 launcher login but, no PC password??
---
Almost certainly, but like others have already said they might get twisty on us and have Primordus or Steve show up as well. 
---
I’m personally burnt out—hah!—on fiery stuff after PoF so I’m really hoping for Steve the water dragon somehow and an accompanying underwater overhaul of some kind.
---
Yep you should, had somone in my guild delete all his characters when he was drunk. Even though that was incredibly  stupid he was able to get them back. Probs to Anet for having back ups.
---
No doubt. Still easier to bring a receipt for that stuff to small claims court to get it replaced, in my opinion. But, it's not like either scenario is good.
---
No, pure healers are non-existent because of the way the combat is. 
---
We have support, dps and very occasionnaly tanks. 
---
Support will likely bring heal with them, but their main use is damage buff and other buffs. 
---
Tanks are only useful at all on certain raid encounters because of how aggro works, also in gw2, more dps= better survivability because a dead foe dont hurt you and stacking defenses wont save you for long enough to be worth it, generally. 
---
As a druid, youd be a beacon of buffs for your team, and youd have the option to heal a bit when your team needs it more than damage.
---
While i appreciate the well thought out post, I was mostly taking the piss out of the irony calling races besides human - in GW2 no less- boring.
---
Like have you seen FFXIV's racial selection? barring Hrothgar it's human, wide human, tall human, short human, human with cat/rabbit ears, and spiky human.
---
I never had pc password neither on my desktop or laptop
---
Get that jerk locked up.
---
druids bring might, fury, regeneration, spirits, and a unique buff called spotter, and on top of that, they bring healing. 
---
The trinity isn't really a thing here, we have a set up of DPS and supports primarily, where the supports bring buffs, condition cleanses, blocks, etc, and healing.
---
"8 guesses". 
---
If people have noticed by now, he knows whats going on, 8 guesses is such a random number, most people would pick 10. 
---
Some of this is true, some of this is bull.
---
Simple, you still have access to everything(except the special mecanic, f abilities for guardian) that the base class had when you pick an elite spec.
---
Dont know where you got that info from, but elite spec dont change your class nearly as much as you seem to think it does. Sure the style of gameplay change but its silly to complain about MORE content when you still have access to everything you had before...
---
I'm sorry that my passing comment on the internet came off as a personal attack on your character. In the future I'll try to refrain from making jokes , about a game I'm not even playing, in the presence of those who may not understand them.
---
Playing a game while your SO is yelling at you will never end well. Log out, talk it out, and structure your free time to not cause these kinds of issues.
---
I disagree strongly with the notion of applying the framework of abusive relationships to public company &lt;-&gt; customer relationships.
---
Yes, there's people behind the company. Absolutely none of them deserve abuse on a personal level, and hitting them during a Twitch stream (while, sadly, to be expected) is gross.
---
Putting an entire company on the level of a private person in an abusive relationship comparison is disingenuous at best and harmful to discussing the issues at play at worst though.
---
I believed in you. I always have.
---
They're also an increased variety of play that applies to all game modes.  GW2 desperately needs that right now.
---
&gt; You can salvage food now
---
Did you hear that [RMX], [RmX], and [rMx]? You bank guilds are gonna get cashed out this month!
---
PoF was huge, what are you talking about
---
I legit think that sometimes ANet employees go like that. They see a forum or reddit topic about dungeons and be like "Wait, what? Since when does this game hav- Oh! Oh yeah, lol"
---
Casino coins could be consumed for PoF mastery experience. The note suggests consuming them all allows you to get all your experience at once, instead of clicking each one.
---
What're you gonna do? Send Regional Manager Darth Maul?
---
Im really hoping they dont just plan to continue doing living world. I think they need another expansion at some point. The problem is idk if they have the means to do it
---
