Better solution is to make two versions, a dungeon for the casuals with simpler mechanics and then an actual raid for the raiders. Maybe even make it so the last boss is only in the raid version so the raiders have something special.
---

---
I don't think you need to really play everything an MMO has to offer to make a good video comparing them. To save time, you could watch some guides rather than playing it yourself. Something like a [guide about Druid healers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cas4skkW8Ag) because healers are less common in gw2 because they're unnecessary in most content. Or a [guide for the final boss in one of the raids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEfAH8DdaUg). Or [a guide for one of the top tier fractals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxzywO8-Ha8). With those, you can get a very good idea of how the high end combat works without playing through everything yourself. 
---

---
And if time is an issue whatsoever, then I *strongly* recommend you watch some videos when you get to FFXIV in your tournament. It has a much longer beginner's curve, and similarly ramps up complexity, depth, and fun a lot at max level.
---
I will watch the guides, however the whole point is to play through it myself because it's an opinion based competition, my opinion, and i need to play the games to form my opinion.
---
Except you dont because there's no point of playing content that gives no rewards. People would do the easy mode once (just like with t1 fractals or story paths in dungeons) and still find something to complain about.
---
As for hard mode, as much as raiders think that it will solve their problems, I doubt that it actually would. Majority of raiders are struggling with most basic mechanics even (people are still doing ranged strat deimos for example). It would keep pro guilds busy for sure though.
---
In the best situation there would be 3 modes - entry mode for getting familiar with mechanics and story (with basic rewards as well), normal with difficulty of w1/w2/w5 bosses and repeatable CMs as 3rd "mode".
---
However, having more than 1 difficulty increases the time between raid releases which is the problem number 1.
---
As much as I do respect they spend more on squishing bugs, 30 mastery doesn't mean much in central tyria as long as as you got a tag :) they're totally capable to do anything.
---
We also had wild tengu as enemies in HoT. Still dunno why cuz no lore
---
With the skyscale and skimmer you can easily get to the limit in less than an hour in Thunderhead peaks on one toon. I do it every day.
---
I laugh everytime how the show teaches you say it wrong
---
I read it before it was edited. It came off as quite negative with only the part about Beavis and Butthead's fever dreams.
---
We get it, you love this game. What the video did was create a side by side comparison of two popular(?) games in the same genre based on multiple mechanics and dimensions that make up just about every mmo. On top of that, these are the sole opinions of the content creator based on their experiences. I didn't see anywhere or any indication of someone expecting praise for their opinion, they're just stating it. If that upsets you, you should make a video of your opinions in defense of the game. Otherwise vote it down and move on. You telling them to quit the series because you don't agree with the info presented is incredibly childish.
---
&gt;I have learned to never express my opinion on anything ever
---
You're clearly overreacting. You had a very shallow take on this game's combat and people immediately went for that, it's more than expected. 
---
&gt;I really enjoyed this community until a few moments ago
---
You should still enjoy it regardless of your poorly constructed argument. We don't get everything right, humans you know, it happens.
---
Thé amazing part to me is that you were doing the dark. It’s been on my list for 2 years but I just never find people doing it.
---
That's true, though you can't take it anywhere sadly, just wherever inside the instance.
---
[removed]
---
I second this. Nearly everything in pve that isn’t a champion or higher boss can be done solo with any class if you build correctly and most importantly have fun playing your class
---
I really like Chrono/Herald for open world, you cover most if not all boons.
---
Chrono/renegade is also great.
---
Great detective work - thanks!
---
If I had to guess. They're probably having issues figuring out optimal rotation and knowing when skills are off cool down.
---
In wow, by using some add ons and moving the UI around it makes it easier to keep track of which skills are off CD so you know when to use them and it's easy to track debuffs/dots (conditions) on mobs so you know when best to refresh them as conditions don't stack in wow but only refresh.
---
If any of your friends play condi builds, they may not understand how condition build works as condi builds in GW2 is pretty much press all the buttons and keep stacking them whereas condi equivalent builds in WoW only need to refresh conditions just before it falls off the mob, so there's a habit of only casting conditions once then do the Wow equivalent of auto attacking to fill in between the time when you need to refresh them.
---
If they play power builds, they may have trouble keeping track of when their CDs are back up. Wow add-ons allow you to keep track of this better. They may also not be weapon swapping either and it's exacerbating the issue as they don't know when CDs are back up again. Nothing much can be done here except to just keep practicing and to learn to do things without the luxury of add-ons or being able to move the UI around.
---
Whats the best possible gph right now anyways? 30g or something maybe a bit higher. Anet might just do something because they thinkg the farm is too good even for a small number of people to be taking advantage of it. Remember 40farm? more straight forward than this to be sure but they still nerfed the ability to farm it.
---
what a bait this is....

One I cannot ignore!

To be fair, Logan's got a documented history of ditching the plan and running off in the heat of the moment.
---
"free" xD
---
Also yeah me2 but I gained some gold in the process. Never gambled again since then.
---
This is one of the many reasons why Tangled Depths is the best map in gw2.
---
Can you give more details?
---
You have not seen me angry. Don't let the negatives outweigh the positives if you really enjoy doing it that much, I'm just too old to care about being polite.
---
&gt; Minions at the cost of lifeforce
---
I think you might be onto something there. It would almost imitate necromancer in Pre-Searing, where you constantly have to kill things to keep your army going. Only instead of getting more bodies to animate, you're gathering lifeforce to sustain them.
---
From the Divinity: Original Sin series of games, Pet Pal is a trait that let's the player communicate with any animal in the game.
---
alot of nice responses, i will def look in to all of these thank you guys so much for your time to respond with this nice info! Gold star for all of you! :)
---
That is so adorable ever since the game started they are my favorite, I wish they were a playable class.
---
I want to upvote this because indeed, hidden cats make everything better. But I also want to downvote it because it includes the phrase "Tangled Depths is the best map in gw2." I'm so confused.
---
i miss this, doesnt look right in phase 2 with wings still attached
---
It's all about exploration. And Tangled Depths is the best for that.
---
GO AUTOCHESS?!?!
---
Hmmm, come to think of it, what could the summoned golems be coded as? Minions? Pets? Or just golem? 
---
Wait, are minions considered as active companions right now? I’ve never thought about this before. If so golem May also be considered as companions.
---
Yes, I’m thinking about runes related to the new elite trait when typing all things above.
---
&gt; It's almost like Anet is trying to make easy bosses and interesting story to bring casuals
---
I mean, they make interesting stories for raids since W1...
---
Wait a sec... Eir is?
---
What is easier to fix - the overall balance or one specific boss? Use your brain.
---
It's somewhat acceptable if you need trade contracts.
---
Apparently, early on in development, it was planned that every dungeon would have a secret jumping puzzle hidden inside, but the idea was scrapped pretty early on.  The most complete one is in Ascalonian Catacombs (the JP is based off of one of the puzzles at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with the hidden bridge).  I think there's remnants of one in Sorrow's Furnace, and one other dungeon too.
---
Additionally, there's a hidden slime boss in Citadel of Flame that players clearly aren't supposed to actually be able to access (You have to go pretty far off the beaten path and make some funky jumps to scale a ledge, and it's a one-way trip where the only way to get back is waypointing).  Behind the slime boss is a lengthy tunnel, filled with slimes, that eventually reaches an area that features in path 3.  It's not entirely clear whether it was intended for something more, like maybe a dynamic, alternate route for path 1 or 3, or if it's just a hidden easter egg.
---
I remember we both got shunned in map chat the other day for this. (Paige Petrahorn if you remember)
---
PRAISE JOKO!!!

---
A solid bunch of underwater weapon skins, I think mostly spears after the transition from harpoons (but also a couple of harpoon guns and a few tridents), that became unobtainable though they still exist in game and can be previewed using their codes
---
Rytlock wielding a staff (with a new skin) in HoT trailer
---
You can now talk to animals, all kinds of animals, bunnies,monsters, centaurs, lizards. Except for stupid dragon possessed enemies, elementals and the creatures who are not in the mood to talk to two legged creatures
---
I can get behind that. I think that a caveat in the video/post about what you haven't done, and a quick explanation about what you've seen in reviews/guides to fill that gap would have alleviated a lot of the "backlash".
---
Well, the lowermost room in Tarir goes deep enough that the water is actually there in it, so...
---
Ranger pets? No.
---
Miniature pets? No.
---
Home/special instance pets? Yes.
---
Though you can get the mini fox and it'll be like you're taking it places, but out in the wild is too dangerous to pause and play.
---
Literally anything would be more interesting than "let's just go to this place from gw1".
---
That golem was present, under names that changed with the situation, through almost all of LS1 and seems to have a great deal of back story and story snippets that are hidden but also playing out along side the main story we experience... none of which was has been shown in game or otherwise AFAIK.  
---
It isn't a major character in any real sense, but it was present during the "more public events" of LS1.  (Meaning the kinds of stuff that make politicians look real bad whether they could have stopped it or not)  
---
Presumably the Bait-o-tron in Jahai that pulls a bloodstone elemental out into the field to lure the Death-Branded Shatterer is the same golem, at it again.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pNMlcNtuOE  "Cerebro" but this isn't even all of what's down there.
---
I did guardian and revenant with my friend it felt pretty good on survivability and boons. 
---
Solo I found necro pretty chill so maybe it can be paired with something else
---
Lmaoooooooo chill bro
---
I haven’t heard about it but it sounds reallllly awesome. Me and my best friend always play together so it would be fun and cool for us. I haven’t played pubg or halo myself but I imagine it’s the same feeling as driving a Jeep or a banshee together.
---
Nicely made list!   
---
Honestly, I'd rather the list remain short and full of unique mounts rather than overpacked.   
---
My dreams: 
---
* Underwater Mount 
---
* WvW Dolyak - Ideally, we may get some WvW love and surprises. Players being able to transfer supplies themselves and directly help out camps on their slower mount would be cool. Maybe even bring supplies to a Commander that needs to build siege. 
---
* Black Lion Caravan - Some premium caravan you can whistle for - it could be a big elephant or Dolyak that has a merchant/representative riding on board, alongside a ton of other features. (Maybe it would basically be the "Teleport to friend" permanent version for merchants - timer included to keep individual merchants valuable). Imagine a big Dolyak rushes alongside you where you are and pops open a mini 'base camp'. Repair anvil, merchant, bank, etc. Bonus points if you could ride inside to specific places like towns/etc (more from flavor). 
---
I hope all future mounts feel incredibly unique and not overpowered!
---
I would switch to hammer guard instantly
---
I ran this for a long while (as scourge), and eventually threw out my marshal set as it began to gather dust.
---
Scourge just plain doesn't do enough damage with a power build, even more so if you take out ferocity, making this seriously miserable for soloing. As for heal/support, the traits alone do well enough to process large numbers (10+) of downed players, especially if you run ritual of life and put well of blood as your heal skill. Shroud 4 will last long enough that the first wave of pulls will have gotten back up with two overlapping wells doing revive duty; or you can stagger them for more steady death rates.
---
Reaper heals by doing damage, and marshal doesn't let you do that much damage. It's even worse for champions and the like, where you want to do burst damage while they're exposed/stunned. If you want to run healing power maybe go x-1-1 instead, since blighter's boon will scale. But then you might as well go with spite for reaper's might... and just go full on into damage at that point, which lands you back at x-1-3.
---
Holy shit I never knew that, that’s a shame it’s not in
---
There is actually an app/website called Tyria3D that was able to render a great number of things from old dat files that never quite made it into GW2 for any number of reasons.  These include PvP maps, larger/unfinished/different versions of maps that exist now, and some concept-type maps that were not released like the Riverside Province area that was the subject of a mission in GW1.  If it isn't available anymore, there should be a group of youtube videos by Wooden Potatoes detailing a lot of what was found.  
---
It's been so long that I don't remember the source, but there was apparently supposed to be a ground attack sequence after we shot Zhaitan off of the tower he was clinging to.  Basically it was both unfinished and the duration of the Arah story mode instance was already pretty insane.  A very long time ago you could jump off the airship at the end of the instance and swim over to the body and look at it, there remains an unreachable PoI where this was supposed to take place too.  I recall a dev being the one to mention that it was unfinished when release day came, so it had be cut.  
---
Similarly with Mordremoth, it was made to impale it's head on a spike in the tree because it was decided that having yet another sequence where we do go "Up the tree, quickly!" would have dragged out the meta too long.  
---
The original dungeons saw a lot of cut content... The Ascalon Catacombs instance has as much unused as it does stuff that does get used and much of the unused areas are full of mobs.  The Sorrow's Embrace zone has a PoI, that you have to pull mildly tricky jumps to get to, which is far out of the way of the path's path.  SE also has an unused forge that you have to map break to reach (There are youtube videos).  The Twilight Arbor dungeon instance was changed via LS1, the paths in that dungeon go by which direction you choose to travel, the Aetherpath having replaced the "forward up" (FU lol) option.  However, in the location where you would have chosen to go up or forward again, you can see the mobs that used to inhabit that area of the FU path still present.  The 4th path of the Arah explorable dungeon has an event dealing with killing giants at the very end of it that was meant to be a gating event and it is still there but opens no doors and yields no extra rewards save for a needless waypoint.  
---
Another thing to be cut was the Canthan district of Divinity's Reach, and Cantha in it's entirity from GW2.  This happened because of real life stuff.  NCSoft is GW2's publisher and based in Korea, while GW2 is also marketed in mainland China... Both cultures basically want to see the other wiped off the face of the earth, and get really offended when their cultural styles are blended.  (Though incorrectly mixing celts, norse and some others is completely okay with them.)  GW1's Cantha did blend the styles, and there was an uproar.  The ultimate result was a portion of Divinity's Reach called The Great Collapse, which was meant to be the Canthan District and has since been turned into the Crown Pavilion.  
---
The polearm weapon type actually has made it into the game, but not available for players to use.  We do NPCs carrying weapons that could fall into this weapon type, or may just be NPCs breaking the rules, who knows.  Either way, these things keep getting teased and rumors that they may come soon have persisted basically since launch.  https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Polearm_(weapon_type)  
---
Weapons in GW1 could be dyed... Though often imperfect, it was possible.  This never made it into GW2, and the most I've ever heard about it was that it was a redditor recently commenting that it was a development trade off between getting a functioning trade post in game, or getting to put dyes on our weapons. (And back items, as the system considers back items as weapons) https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bzn4by/how_i_feel_with_the_new_legendary_trinkets_effect/eqwwdck/
---
There was the original pirate town Lion's Arch, then the destroyed LA that officially existed in game longer than the original... Both were a part of LS1, and now basically not available anymore (Save for parts of the original LA via personal story instances).  
---
Several skins from the original PvP locker system (SPvP had a system with a similar function to the wardrobe) are not available any longer because no method to aquire them has been put back in.  https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_unobtainable_wardrobe_unlocks
---
There are some other things that may also not quite count because these were removed for crashing people:  The bridge to CoF used to rise up from below when the entry events were completed, and fall if the defend event failed.  And the Claw of Jormag's wings used to shatter completely when it was shot out of the sky.  I'm sure there exist other things like this as well, but these are the only ones I recall off hand.  AFAIK, you can sometimes still the old CoF bridge "spawning" animation if you can see it soon enough after your client first loads the asset.
---
As people have mentioned, there is an entire lane missing from Dragon's Stand, and an unexplained nightmare court grand duchess helping us out during the final encounter.  We also run into nightmare court members, and Faolain herself, who were captured by Mordremoth but didn't want anything to do with him either.  So there was an entire arc of story that didn't make it into the game.  
---
Similarly with a mysterious Sylvari who was not of the Pale tree, he went back to his people, supposedly, but nothing ever came of it.  
---
Just to beat on HoT just a little, the Auric Bason and it's art and story are so wildly different from VB, TD and even DS that it feels like a large amount of content was cut or simply never made (due to time constraints) to properly bridge these zones both artistically and by story (Compare the color pallets of the zones).  AB has the story it needed to tell in it to set things up farther, but this is also where the HoT story very clearly begins rushing hardcore.  To me, it looks like it didn't get all the content it was supposed to.  
---
There are a lot of things out there that suggest places that were intentionally set aside for content to be placed, and may still be used for such in the future, but IDK if these unused zone portals or places like are shaped right for that job were properly "cut" as such.  Brisban Wildlands has one such zone portal to nowhere (non-functional).  Just outside Ebonhawke is a closed gate that leads south, which corresponds now to one in the Highlands zone in PoF.  In the Southeast corner of Mt Maelstrom there is a place that was blocked off by metal plates that looks suspiciously like an unused zone portal, and one roughly in the middle of the west side of Sparkfly Fen that looks ready for a zone portal to be dropped into it.  Not cut content as such, but places that were clearly set aside.  The wizard's tower in Kessex Hills has been a source of rumors since even GW1, again this is more of a "what could be" rather than something that ever existed.  
---
Here's one that doesn't really qualify for cut content, but there is a part of the LS4 e5 final instance where you run through a hallway that is set above a room where fighting is taking place.  While this isn't terribly special of itself, the room is not accessible from anywhere else AFAIK, but it seems to contain a large forge.  I can't put my finger on why that room struck me when I noticed it, it just felt familiar in the moment (and in the ~20 minutes I spent trying to find a way inside it lol).
---
What criminal cut this from the game
---
Would have been interesting to have a tiny fight with the forged in LA as a part of an instance. Would have put those defenses built after Scarlett’s attack to good use
---
S also slows your speed once you level off, so it's very dangerous to use. Losing speed will prevent you from gaining altitude. C doesn't slow you down, so it's much better to use.
---
Ohh this is a good one. The invisible walls in gandara are so poorly made that it’s pretty easy to walk out, not break, with a springer or something. There’s a lot of evidence that more of the map was supposed to be implemented. Maybe would have made the “boss” battle not low quality and made kourna a bit more interesting
---
People do it regularly since the patch to reduce the difficulty and increase the rewards.  Check LFG.
---
I can go and see if my screenshots show that...I swear I remember it not touching the water I was in, because I was trying to jump up into the room and couldn’t. But I’ll take a look at my screenshots.
---
Thank you! I never really put out anything but I think when I get better I might start doing so! This was my first piece that I thought I would share mostly because I love Matt's art and since I saw his piece on asura like 7 years ago I wanted to try for myself!
---
I looked up his name myself and that does look really cool in a stylized way!
---
Why not fractal 42?
---
You might just not have actually been at the lowest room?  I'm thinking of the room where the last Grand Chest is, when you're looting Tarir after a successful meta event.
---
&gt;but you don't really develop any attachment to the characters as a result of them just appearing one day
---
Yet a good chunk of players felt betrayed and angry when Braham told the Commander to go fuck themselves. The attachment was obviously made by that point. 
---
It just required more suspension of disbelief than normal on the player's part and a bit of time to get familiar with our head-strong Norn pal. Some folks couldn't do it and that's cool. It adds to the list good reasons to remake S1.
---
While a lot of the open world stuff might be impossible now like they say... Which I can see. Where are they going to stick Molten Alliance troops that doesn't interfere with Bloodstone critters, Awakened, world bosses, HPs, and the endless amount of meta on the maps now? Not a lot of blank space to work in... they absolutely can instance the majority of it.
---
Unless they deleted the coding and assets. That would have been massively stupid of them to have done.
---
The way males hold their greatsword looks so derpy.
---
Correct.
---
I didnt know about the duchesses existence as shes not someone ive noticed when doing the meta, thats so weird they left her in when its obvious shes a part of cut story... I forget about who malyack even was cause its been so long since i did sylvari story. Seeing the tree he came from would have been so fucking cool. I remember back when i did that story step (well before HoTs) i thought his tree would be mentioned again within the personal story
---
Ask the terrible customer support.
---
o i had a pretty shitty PC back then too but never crashed, i also remember them (wings) being underwater just behind and under second phase fight :D
---
Ze goggles. Zey do nothing.
---
Read this in Joko voice
---
Pet pal would be fun, especially if it had the same kind of dialogue as in DoS2. The rats have the best dialogue by far. Being silly and talking about cheese while at the same time telling how to solve a puzzle.
---
Also, no Lone Wolf? Makes the game even better imo.
---
a bit but still miles better than females imo. i feel like they should hold it like my Asuran Daredevil holds his staff when running, up on his shoulder behind his head https://i.imgur.com/Sh1CBiG.png
---
This is actually very useful
---
When i returned after 5 years, im kinda shocked that im still doing the old symbol, pull, spin2win using the greatsword.....even with 2 new expansions and new weapons, im doing the same maneuver still...
---
Heck, I can't even get Springe + Bond of Faith to Griffon to beat a normal Griffon jump.
---
Was expecting to be Skyrim rickrolled for a moment.
---
Quick question. The support with Anet allows you to show your serial key directly. Why bother waiting to show it? For next time, always set up 2 factor authorization. Then stuff like this won't happen. Hopefully a dev is kind enough to let you prove it this time.
---
Search for Youtube videos of Junundu in GW Nightfall (used to cross sulfurous wastes by swallowing the player and its party - works only on sand, cannot cross stone). GW Eye of the North also had Siege Devourer as mounts thought it only could be used on 2 maps.
---
I'd never recommend that someone learning Thief should try D/D Deadeye over Daredevil, and I main D/D Deadeye because I'm a sucker for the aesthetic and Shadow Flare.
---
The biggest issue with learning encounters as Deadeye is that you are even more dependent on knowing the fights to do both reasonable damage and stay alive, if running Invigorating Precision, due to the far higher requirements with both rotational accuracy and positioning. For both, Invigorating Precision isn't great if you aren't getting off Malicious Backstabs at the correct time (revealed) and at the correct location (flanking, which also removes you from your group and splash healing and boons) compared with your target.
---
Furthermore, you have less innate survivability due to less dodges or emergency evade frames with Vault and if you go down, you can have a long waiting period before Deadeye's Mark refreshes and you can regain the bonus damage of both Malice and Iron Sight. Which further hampers you if it is a boss encounter as you also lose the damage reduction component of Iron Sight.
---
And of course, cleave is lacking to a higher extent which makes you less useful to your team and further diminishes the benefit of Invigorating Precision for learning encounters. 
---
I absolutely adore D/D Deadeye but it isn't really a learning spec (in my opinion) when compared with Daredevil, despite many resources suggesting to the contrary.
---
Is this considered a hate crime?
---
Zerker gears is good (Assassin's is also needed tho) so i think that the main problem comes from the build.
---
If your are playing with GS, the Domination (2/2/1) traitline is really good, followed by Duel (1/3/1)/Chronomancer (2/3/3). 
---
Utility wise, you can try Blink (or WoP), Phantasmal Disenchanter and WoC and for Elite, Moa or WoG. 
---
Mesmer is indeed squishy but it has alot of way to completely avoid damage by using your Distortion,Sword 2,Sword 4,WoP and some CC like Diversion,WoG and Focus 4.
---
Don't forget you couldn't crit them either! 😂
---
I mean even OP used the "F" word.. so that right there is enough to get them a 7 day suspension..
---
selbbub already taking over the maguuma wastes, underwater expansion is coming
---
How did you get that mouse cursor!?
---
The laurel exchange rate is never very good. Have a look at a laurel vendor and see if there's anything worth saving for. It's good for gearing up alts quickly if they use certain gear sets.
---
I it quite the opposite, but I would've loved that. When going through the pitch black grub passage you can at the eastern entrance grab a torch and start climbing up the roots and canyon sides. This cave is at the very top of that passage.
---
Yolo mouse
---
You can urge the griffon into a dive
---
You're little bit less breath-taking.
---
Easily active enough, bloodstone bosses are run frequently and on ember bay it's a bit less active I noticed but still good enough and usually there's s nice Mesmer in JP too.
---
Now that you mention it, I wonder how rich Canach is now. How much did he win on his bets?
---
&gt; is a trait that lets the player communicate with any animal in the game
---
That's called "map chat".
---
Why on earth not? Do you think bug fixing is some secret spy shit? LOL
---
If I wouldn't have read in the comments that you never played end-game content I would have been really confused.
---
People worded it a bit aggressive but -yes- you REALLY have to play endgame content to judge the combat system.
---
You can beat the core game mostly by pressing auto-attacks and never have to look into your trait lines. You rarely have to cleanse conditions and synergy really doesn't matter.
---
There is a huge difficulty Spike in Heart of Thorns and while Path of Fire was easier it's still miles above core Tyria.
---
However, Raids and High-Level Fractals are the only PvE content that requires(!) you to run a good build and actually play good. Fractal 100 is no joke. There are tons of mechanics flying around and you still have to do a proper rotation or you find yourself just dodging around and do 3k damage instead of the 15-30k you should be doing. My T3-fractal runs were a disaster because I was so busy doging everything I barely could suuport my team and you're only 5 in there! I actually had to move to a training golem and memorize the rotation better with Plan "B" what happens if I waste certain hevaily important skills because the boss interrupts/knocks me down, I cancel my own cast because I have to dodge, etc.
---
I've never felt the same impact in WoW combat that I had in GW2. I mainly played warlock back then but the Macros did most of the job for me and it mostly was a set-up with fire attacks before seeing one giant number because you fired your attack that's based on all the fire-stacks (or something, don't quiet remember). Seeing the one big number after a build up can be satisfying but being a Chronomancer on Fractal 100 and managing to do all the mechanics well while also giving my team perma-quickness and not through macros but actual skilled gameplay is waaaaaay more rewarding.
---
I can't just press a makro-button and the game plays itself, nor can I just stand in one place and let the tank/healer do the harder job. (Because nobody in this games challenging content can "just stand around") Chronomancer rotations are insane and doing them wrong can cost your team so much damage when you atcually are meant to push it heavily when you're playing well. Actually, doing them very wrong can get you killed as the rift teleports you back wherever you first activated it once the time is up and if you're bad at predicting bosses you probably end up in their deadly AoE attack with no stamina do dodge, haha. Learning Chronomancer was a ride and it has absolutely nothing to do with Core-Tyria Personal-Story gameplay as a Mesmer. (I actually found Mesmer combat incredible lame until I got into the jungle and was soooo happy to have Clones that can draw aggro when enemies can suddenly 2-hit you.)  Solo'd my first hero-point/champion there as mesmer and suddenly the class felt so good I made it my main (as Chrono) for fractals. 
---
TL;DR: You don't have to play raids to judge the combat but -some- difficult content has to be played or else you're never forced to actual learn your class. There is more depth in this game than can be seen on the surface. 
---
... and playing a good elementarist/weaver is so difficult I never managed to do it. I mean... I play it in open-world. I just am not good enough at it to take it to T4 Fractals or raids :p
---
Says someone who plays a class that just spams actions.
---
I came to say that too, hehe. Too much /r/gaming!
---
Plenty of people do the whole thing anyway. I know I did. Asking you to master an area to get a legendary trinket that's completely optional is not all that unreasonable.
---
They could easily strip it down to just one episode with story steps going:
---
* Flame and Frost
---
* Sky pirates of Tyria
---
* Clockwork Chaos
---
* Tower of Nightmares
---
* Escape from Lion's Arch
---
* Battle for Lion's Arch
---
I played with Braham and the gang for Season 2, HoT, Season 3, PoF and Season 4 now... why do i still not care about any of them (like i do for Rytlock, Zojja, Caithe or even Logan)
---
Is it really that ONE season i didn't play
---
i am the very definition of chill ma dude
---
fyi its the same for all the visions
---
I see, thanks for answering!
---
It doesnt say infinite height either, it says infinite FLIGHT; which is possible just fine, Using some random numbers here, Say you start at 35 meters height, you might be able to get a good 5 meters higher up after diving and climbing a few times, but then you also hit the ceiling, but you will be able to maintain that if you dive and climb properly, All it requires is you to have a higher enough starting point and enough space to dive and climb continuously
---
OK there we go: [https://youtu.be/lZdeiz4J3Yo](https://youtu.be/lZdeiz4J3Yo)
---
It really depends, some find it too hard  others dont. Join some training guild and see how it works for you. Snowcrows website has almost everything you need to know about raids.
---
Having ascended weapons and trinkets is a huge bonus.
---
True. Being often encumbered is rather annoying. You either play a strenght based build (since that increases inventory size) or manage every hour or so.
---
Yeah I loved lonewolf AOEmancer before divinitive.
---
What are some good Volatile Magic farms, besides Istan?
---
What is the best Salvage kit combo nowadays? Copper fed  and Mystic or should I think of going for runecrafter too?
---
Thanks for joining, glad you had fun \^\^
---
Yes, it's true. I shamefully admit I saw your name and wall of text. My sincerest apologies!
---
Wtf. I bought a 2000gem mount skin and when I got it it had weird red lines and looked crappy. I put in a ticket to ask 'whats the deal' and they flat out told me 'sorry we can't refund gems'
---
invisible wall everywhere ? Cant be outfly or jump by any mount etc ? 👀
---
Art always goes up in value after the artist is dead.
---
you should apologize to yourself, not me
---
is there something we can do yet? i'm still stuck on that...
---
That's fucking cool. I remember doing it back at launch but must have forgotten it since, will check youtube videos for it.
---
Thanks! ;D
---
Congrats, you're both insufferable.
---
Raids are 50% knowing where to stand and 50% using your character efficiently. 
---
You'll be expected to use a meta (ish) build, which usually means swapping a few traits around and maybe a couple of specific skills that you wouldn't otherwise use. Exotic gear is fine, but stock up on food and utility consumables for a bit more oomph.
---
Find a good guild that does training runs on discord - pickup groups can be great but can also be terrible. Guildie runs tend to be more forgiving and a better experience overall.
---
Top tip: Anet often leaves the path to break out of the map hidden in plain sight
---
You mean the Dominion of Winds?
---
Can you elaborate please? I brought up the fact that explorer mode is not a good place for a lvl 55 guy, didn't tell him to leave or anything, yet I'm insufferable?
---
There's 55 achievements listed in my achievement panel that give progress towards the mastery achievement, so no, you do not have to do everything, only 38 out of 55+.
---
Oh yeah, I guess that is what it is. I tried to google search it a while ago,but my terms were like "Map bordering Caledon Forest" and stupid stuff like that.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Is the Dominion of Winds mentioned a lot/at all by NPCs? Im pretty bad with keeping track and piecing together any kinds of lore in gw2, as much as I like to know it.
---
Thanks, by the way.
---
oh well if your personal experience says you can always get your procs 100%..then yea pack it up boys! we've been proven wrong
---
btw it's not just lazy people saying it, iirc it was even in the SC website guide at some point..this unreliability of chill procs
---
i feel you're unable to understand what's the problem with a build that has to struggle a lot to still be under scourge dps-wise..it's the definition of a bad build especially since again, scourge has utility as well!
---
oh yea it stacks bleeds faster probably, meanwhile scourge stacks a lot more torment and burns
---
The game sends you a mail saying that you can do the dungeon, which is indeed made for level 55 characters. I'd never have said a word to the guy.  We are all level 55 at one time.  Might have been fine.
---
you are all breathtaking 🙊
---
That intro is obnoxious
---
Yep this is where the Tengu live and essentially live in isolation with the world. There are a few Tengu by the wall at the end of the bridge you can speak to. Likewise if you go to Lions Arch you'll actually find a gate marking the other side of their border, with a new Tengu defending it there also.
---
If Joko could convince his people to do it, no reason anyone else can't in an isolationist society.
---
Holy shit, Im actually unsure I've ever even made note of "Hey, they're Tengu"
---
Unless I have.. I don't remember d :
---
A horde of bogans descend upon Tyria.
---
Ehh I don’t know when it was because soooo long ago when I played but I remember being super super pissed when they re released the dragon mask (gw1).
---
So moves like this from gw2 are basically expected. The nice thing is now in gw2 we have artificially rare items because of account binding and some items which require quests or achieves... basically like the old mini moa quest on gw1 type of quests are how gw2 works (rather then buy/farm, horde, stack, and sell which was the mentality of gw1).
---
So I already know anything rare as far as skins will be cycled back around (only things they won’t be able to give away... WvW 2k Armor, PvP tendril set, Raid set) so those are what I consider more prestigious then old/re used skins these days.
---
And I’m okay with the gw2 model since there are some exclusives for the “earners” vs the pay/trade your way players (of which I’m not against the power traders, do your thing!... but Im more the “play your way” type by nature in games)
---
Do the masteries also state that there is a separate button (not 1) you should use for diving in order to ensure that the game doesn't bug the fuck out and plummet your ass in t-pose to the ground?
---
Not really trying to be contrarian here but I see a lot of people not even diving with their griffons. I mean we're talking about a game where a lot of people can't even dodge and in that sense the mount movement is like rocket science.
---
He is wrong.  Aetherpath specifically is balanced around being level 80.  A level 55 would get 1 shot.
---
Aetherblade path is lvl 80 though. Pretty sure any damage tick will oneshot him and kill him, skipping downstate entirely. The guy would be absolute dead weight and would make a bearbow ranger look usefull.
---
didn’t the northwest corner of frostgorge lead to bitterfrost frontier
---
I know it's crazy.
---
it is crucial gor even completing some of them.
---
You're humility is refreshing to see.
---
Iirc it’s a developer trademark. The devs tend to put some kind of secret npcs (like a swinging child) to mark that they made the map. This same cat is in Siren’s landing isolated NE of Lyssa’s area
---
&gt; i feel you're unable to understand what's the problem with a build that has to struggle a lot to still be under scourge dps-wise  
---
it doesn't struggle.
---
the last time I played was a year or so ago on another computer, it's been so long that I've forgotten the password for my account, I tried resetting the password but it wants the code from the box-which I have-and one of my characters names-which I have forgotten-is there anyway to recover my account?
---
Not sure what you mean by money, if you mean gold in game or actual IRL cash.  If gold they can remove any of that from the account.
---
you ever just post something and immediately get downvoted?
---
Molten boss engaging fractal lol
---
Did anyone else think Edge of Destiny was weirdly gory? Like I remember it describing people getting their heads crushed by boulders and their brains oozing out or something. I'm not squeamish with fictional violence but I had to stop like halfway though because it was just jarring and not very GW at all :\
---
Today is the last day but I can't join _( ,-,)_ 
---
Time zone.
---
There's another spot like that in the Four Winds Festival area. If you go back far enough into the cliffside, there's a spot where you can just walk right through a bit of wall and find yourself behind the cliffs, walking through shallow water.
---
M.O.X. will look after them when you're gone :) he mentions watching them run around and that he had to clean up another hairball https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/M.O.X.
---
Aetherpath is lvl 80 though. Not being casual won't help him.
---
I don't know about that. A bestiary could be made easily if they just make a picture of the model. For developers, that's infinitely more easy than for players. 
---
The amount of new species and creatures entering the game is also a lot lower than you might think at a first glance. I think in 2019, only about 5 or 6 totally new creatures entered the game? Wisps come to the top of my mind, Skyscales, and well... Other creatures? Haha!
---
Yes, you can do it. Just don't get frustrated if other players kill you while you are running around. That's the nature of the gamemode, and you won't be there for long so don't sweat it.
---
While I'm not against Cantha being a part of GW2 I would say that its too early to implement it. I mean after dealing with human lore in 5 raid wings, nearly 2 living story seasons and one expansion its time to move to another race and deal with their story and lore. The death of Kralkatorrik could lead to some interesting actions in the Charr Legions, leading to a war with the humans again as well as a civil war within the Charr Legions
---
But the race that could really use some foccs now would be the norn. They were out of focus since..... uhhm was there ever a focus on them? Or even some lore tidbits that expand more on them, they have been neglected by Anet for a long time and I think its now time for them to be in the spotlight.
---
Be careful you can cut yourself with this edge ;)
---
The amount of dodges is a problem because people are able to triple dodge inside of objectives, changing it will already make the warclaw very vulnerable.  
---
About gankers, I don't think that addressing the powercreep will solve it because some classes have a natural advantage for that. Also, I don't care about getting ganked outside of my own territory because I'm supposed to be vulnerable out there. But, be ganked inside of my own territory is ridiculous, especially near of a T3 keep.
---
Thats sucks :( i want all the cats
---
Doesn't even answer the question anyways, since "the edge of the map" isn't helpful in the slightest.
---
Yes it is, but it's unique enough that simply calling it "explorable" is horribly misleading when you consider how every other path in the game is 5 levels above story mode. Treating it like the same thing doesn't do people any favors and can lead to misunderstandings like this one
---
savage
---
This, my grp same but replace Lohse with Fane
---
Explorable for dungeons only really means you enter by pressing the Explorable button.
---
You can't start any of the explorable paths in Story, nor the story in explorable.
---
Of course people usually put "Aetherpath" when they go for that one specifically, but just "Explorable" can mean any of all 3. Specially when it's a dungeon daily and there's more people there who may just want any path for the daily.
---
Cant have Rev without expansions. 
---
What about Core Ele?
---
u need HoT for rev
---
yes
---
domino effect.
---
First impressions matter.
---
what weapons to use for spvp? dual daggers and what else? Which amulet and what moveset?
---
Ele works for blobs
---
Ele (staff dps), guard (boons + support), necro (corrupts/wells) and possibly mesmer if comm wants well timed focus pulls/veil bot would be ideal. Hope that helps.
---
Report using in-game function for botting, GM's will take care of it. I don't think the video should be on here.
---
Praise Joko
---
I used a core ranger for a very long time to roam.
---
You probably want [this](https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Radial).
---
I don't see why you're getting downvoted. It's supportive to OP.
---
Added an upvote to help counter the downvotes.
---
Sweet, So I wont get into any kind of trouble with this right???, Cause I honestly dont want to lose this game from my life lol
---
No, it's been approved by ArenaNet.
---
Thanks mate!!! Appreciate it.
---
If you have the expansions soulbeast with warhorn and mesmer.
---
Kind of feel sorry for you. It appears that everyone wants to keep you on 0 votes.
---
I mean, admittedly, this is low effort and definitely could be better; but a meme is a meme, and at least AN effort was put in.
---
It doesn't. Rev comes with HoT.
---
I would also be mad if a guy who is afk makes more money than a guy actually playing the game. And by actually playing the game is watching the afk player.
---
Core ele
---
GM are all get fired.
---
Imagine being so adamant on making 2 gold an hour by afking that you make it your whole purpose in life while spamming reddit about it.
---
There are specific keybinds for every mount in options. Remember that you can do something like shift + key, which makes it easier to figure out a reasonable keybind set to use that doesn't take up an action you already have set. For example, I use shift + w, a, s, d, and e for my mounts!
---
Core Guardian as support still viable
---
Don’t bother arguing with this idiot. 
---
They are from the Guild Taiwan Gate and barely even understand English. Tried to communicate with them and well heavy language barrier. 
---
Additionally he’s been spamming this subreddit with 4 sockpuppets with YouTube videos about this person, screenshots and now a stream for literal months. Mods are doing their best to keep it gone but he posts like 5 times a day with different accounts. Not kidding
---
You replied to the wrong person.
---
Aurene, or any of the other NPC from the story.
---
I've done this before on my turret engi. You only need 2 turret engis and hammer to set up a nest. Quite efficient.
---
Best part, since turrets die every 5min, you can't be accused of true afk.
---
I was confused as well at where my new Adina statue went.
---
Haven't seen any notes about this.
---
It's a tough cookie. On the one hand, it absolutely should be in the game in some fashion or other. On the other, as somebody who's already played through Scarlet's war, I have little interest in playing through it again if it means slowing down or ceasing development on literally anything else. They really shot themselves in the foot with temporary content.
---
At this point in GW2's life cycle, it's difficult to say which would be more profitable - maintaining current players or recruiting new ones.
---
Ask support.
---
scourge is superior because of more utilitie, not because it got way more dps.  
---
benchmark is at 28,5k dps, torment does 7,2k dps. add 45% as if it was moving and it would result in a 3,3k dps increase.  
---
scourge would sit at arround 31,7k with that.  
---
also iT WaS a PoWeR IncReAse. check some traits a condi reaper uses, and you will see it was not only on power. protip: chilling darkness &amp; deahtly chill.  
---
its not the biggest increase every, nevertheless it is one.
---
Wrong, yet so confident.. Such an easy thing to check too.
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Revenant](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Revenant)
---
Not as rich as Canach.
---
Lbow or something else? Besides, isnt Spirit Beast or whatever the Elite spec is called just straight out better than normal Ranger?
---
Praise.
---
Wouldn't this incentivize artists to sell their mentor's art as their own after their mentor's death, whilst putting aside their own works for their protege to sell after their death. Everybody wins!
---
Интересно, а есть русский вариант..
---
It wasn't that it was too much, just seemed out of place from GW or GW2 which is cartoon violence to real gruesome violence. I mean I watched graphic movies and things since I was young, saw lotr in theaters when I was 7 or 8. It just didn't seem to match up with the GW aesthetic is all, like if they suddenly added finisher animations where you disembowel your enemies. But it has been years since i read the book so maybe I'm mis-remembering.
---
&gt; Except you dont because there's no point of playing content that gives no rewards. 
---
Who said there will be no rewards? Current dungeons and fractals have rewards, "Easier modes" for raids should give rewards (easy doesn't mean you wont have to use your skills or brain to go through), but at least less punishing on mechanics.
---
Yea definitely performance issues. Light sources are relatively expensive, and giving players the option to place a gazillion of them in a tiny space would probably result in exploding rigs.
---
what did i just read
---
Yes, they give basic currency and some trash gear. There's a reason why fracs are done over dungeons and why t4 is done more than t1.
---
“The shimmer gate leads to an unfathomable, endless ocean” is definitely a sentence that I would’ve thought would describe something much cooler
---
Sorry for my bad english
---
Best?  Most will be doable but not optimal. Here a core Necro example [Core WvW Build](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vRAQNBmQDbkkGqpxeaw2G4wxBuQBbzA4AmFxJUF00oMeWA-jFTBQBJU9DsoEBjKh0wFBAAPBA8pR4f7PwFlGlUJY+0FkFlBIUFkAAHAO/8zP/8zjUAqOGA-w) and video with original poster [https://youtu.be/Oxht30HFci0](https://youtu.be/Oxht30HFci0) . You could use a combo of Bezerker, Valkyrie and Soldiers gear I suppose.
---
If i was your sister i would shout at you and tell you to stop act like a baby and grow up and get some manners.
---
Alternatively, you can buy limited (half the uses of a normal tool) special effect tools with karma.
---
like all other loot, Anet creates it out of nothing.
---
I earn more gold than you do in a month by doing my raid clears and T4 fracs on monday - and I actually play the game and have fun :)
---
You're either a very weird troll or a sad, pathetic human.
---
Buy this on TP if yu have the gold to spare.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lacan,_Denied_Respite_of_Severance
---
Unlocks the same skin.
---
What kind of human keeps a launcher like this on the internet, brav, this is not good and i paid big boi money on the DLC's.
---
Snaff being dead is like one of the basic beginning pieces of GW2 lore though... that’s like sitting down to read The Two Towers and complaining when someone mentions that Boromir is dead
---
I'm in the same server group as you and I've noticed that it depends on the time of day and day of the week. When it's active, it's loads of people, but it can seem dead during off hours. It's also important to check each map. If you see Commander tags, stuff is usually happening.
---
I know, thats why you are not my sister.
---
Calm down, i tried to make the text a little fun to read.
---
Dont even have a sister.
---
Owh lawd!
---
Yeah I couldn't remember a patch note or anything about it either, and searching the sub I found nada.
---
It's a huge positive change for scribing, I don't know what it applies to (if it's only kp trophies or if it's more). But it is amazing.
---
This is what it is. Just a launcher. Wait for it to finish and get on with it. It seems only you have problems with it since when its so fast. 2 clicks and u are in the game easy as that
---
Many things in guild halls are there to protect the stability of the map. Local cap, map cap, missing auras ... etc.
---
There is something in options that puts a timer on your cooldowns (iirc default is just the pie slice recharge). That may help. I also might just be confusing this with something else, since I've had it show how many seconds until recharge since forever.
---
And I think having been out for a decade, the need for being too protective with spoilers is diminished.  Can't keep everything under wraps forever.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the knowledge bomb. The Lake Doric part is pretty funny, I don't think I played early enough to see that completion pop up on DR comp.
---
It's weird to think (or is it? I don't know anything about the Tengu) that a bunch of the maps were underwater.
---
I have to say that WP has a really good reason for being triggered about LS1 though. The NPE (new player experience) is really shit for the living story because of it. Also I missed the introduction of Marjory and Kashmir. I would love to go back and actually be introduced to them. I ended up having to watch some video on YouTube to get a partial experience.
---
WP really wants the NPE to be so good that people want to stay. Almost every stream he talks about it and he's right. I really think focusing on new players AND keeping them is something they have to do. I've brought over a few people to the game and all of them have quit before they even finished the personal story. 
---
That's why when I was invited to give them feedback via private survey I told them my concerns for the NPE.
---
&gt;As far as I know, this portal has been here for years now and yet still no hints about where it should be exactly leading us to. :'(
---
A couple years back, around when Head of the Snake launched iirc, Linsey Murdock talked a bit about some maps planned but scrapped early in development, some early enough that they didn't get a name yet. And north of Brisban was mentioned as one of those.
---
My guess is that it was planned to be a level 25-35 map for the Maguuma Jungle, similar to how Gendarran Fields, Lornar's Pass, and Fields of Ruin cover those levels for the other four main regions of the core game. If we look at [the novels' map of Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Tyria_map_%28novel%29.jpg), we can see a square dot put around a bunch of places that would be dungeons (AC, SE, CoF - then "Flame Citadel" - CoE, Arah), and two other square dots (Bloodstone Fen, Ruins of Denravi); my theory being that they were meant to be dungeons, too, and got replaced by Caudecus's Manor and Twilight Arbor respectively (really wish they kept Ruins of Denravi as a dungeon and not some tiny no-one-cares-about corner of Brisban Wildlands).
---
I suspect that the map was to be "Majesty's Rest" and lead to a WM-focused dungeon, before it was scrapped and a new dungeon entrance made at Fort Vandal (before S2 turned that portal into a map, it was a portal protected by level 80 champs that had the same structure as other dungeon portals: a portal in a structure that has a PoI and a nearby WP) before Fort Vandal itself was replaced with Caudecus's Manor dungeon.
---
38g is cheap
---
Okay we'll all collectively stop because you asked
---
My pet gets sad when it dies.
---
Wish they'd make more novels. There's plenty of room for more stories to be told.
---
It's more like sitting down to read Fellowship of the ring and complaining someone mentions the ring belonged to Sauron.
---
Will repeat here that eles get melted solo (ele main). Best way for an ele is to be in a zerg and output as much damage as possible.
---
&gt; guard (boons + support)
---
no, dont do this. Firebrand is superior in every way imaginable, a core guard in a zerg is a letdown nowadays
---
£1100, and I wouldn't know where to start. Would you recommend PC Specialist for that?
---
hi can i check with you about the keyfarm?
---
when does the key drop? when you level to 10?
---
The list will be quite short because anet normally doesn't give official statements about add-ons being approved or not. There were a few exceptions but that's all about it. Just look for the features of the add-ons and if they are not against the TOS then they are fine to use.
---
[Policy: Third-Party Programs](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65547/policy-third-party-programs/)
---
This is literally what I just told you. 
---
But you get far more points from nodes than +1ing, and if you +1 someone, you will have to deal with them at far when they respawn.
---
This is amazing news.  
---
I hope it is not a bug.
---
Shame they didn't give a proper closure to the Edge of Destiny storyline, they just disbanded, forgot about Zojja, and did pretty much nothing on the latest story episode, which should have been their finale as well.
---
how do i delete someone else's post
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character
---
Most ascended trinkets are ***UNIQUE***, as in you can only use one of them.  So you'll need two different rings, for example.
---
yes! :) best thing imo is certaintly to buy the living world stories and to play through the story!  
---
next can come bank space later , but story and unlocking all the game maps is the first priority imo :)
---
/r/buildapcforme can help you out, then.
---
another oversight that should be addressed :)  
---
personally i yearn greatly for decoratable houses and more choice of home instances  
---
with craftable items and decorative things, house lights would need to have a lightsource not just a model of a fire torch....

---
Leveling up huntsman is actually cheaper, and more useful on the long run.
---
This is the comment we all need to upvote!
---
yea but given its price might as well level huntsman..it's slightly more expensive but worthwhile in the long-run
---
warrior spear 5 then :)
---
I’m with ya on that one. Definitely do not waste the bulk of your gems on the gathering tools it’s so unnecessary, especially if you tend to want to play the game naturally and earning gold through fractals and metas. Gathering is extremely boring and even if you do bringing some extra gathering tools is more than enough. 
---
As a newer player I think your biggest annoyance is the lack of inventory space and management. You will notice you always have to stop and others wait for you cuz you can’t loot in group activities. Getting that copper fed is amazing and if you only play one character like some people get an inventory space. It’s not as value-for-your-gold as a character slot, but it makes opening a large batch of items better and able to not NPC during fractals. For pure storage space get a character slot when it’s on sale and use it as a mule you’re gonna need it I bet! 
---
Perhaps you can save 500 gems to treat yourself to a little cosmetic? Haha jk you probably want utility first.
---
Based on your other post (single character, newish player):
---
* **World Boss Portal Device**- notifies &amp; teleports characters to boss fights for free, as long as you are at an appropriate level for the fight.
---
* Content- For more story &amp; lore if that's your jam, some LW episodes have nice rewards, one even has a Black Lion Chest Key for every character you complete it with.
---
* Unbreakable gathering tools with a glyph- perks on gathering, more stuff to sell if you're not crafting.
---
* Permanent Mistlock Pass- access to bank/crafting/etc, will teleport you back where you came from.
---
* Character slot- always nice to try other builds, or to have a weekly keyfarmer.
---
Bank Slots if you feel you need them, keep in mind Bag Slots are only for the character you unlock them on. I bought a Home Instance stone myself early on, because I knew I wanted to max out my home instance.
---
For Skyscale you'll need access to all LWS4 maps. Keep in mind it is a long collection, a lot of content in end-game areas, will require crafting (or buying those items off the TP for a fair amount of gold). Not trying to dissuade you from pursuing it, just that for new players it may be overwhelming. I wouldn't quite compare it to a Legendary collection, but it's up there.

The dude JUST BOUGHT the book. It's not like a game patch where they're going to get the content shoved down their throat whether they like it or not. Sorry bud but "technically correct" while frowning and scratching your chin is the only form of correct that you are.

I really hate that this Karka tonic is so damn rare. I really want an endless one like we have for the young Karka.

I leveled up a necromancer on a f2p account and plan to make a power minion master for open world stuff. Since i like the game, i just bought the expansions and am now wondering what classes i should use my insta-lvl80 upgrades on. I would like to make an alt to use in fractals/dungeons/raids in the future, since i heard minion master isn't that good for these game types. Any advice?
---
Really? I made raid statues a few months ago and I had to manually add all the statues in the assembly.
---
I aint complaining either, be it a bug, intended change, whatever. IT FUCKING ROCKS!
---
Introducing portalling the enemies can add some fun to the game, like lure the enemy mob to the portal and drop off the cliff or something like that. E.g. dropping the turrets in Portal was pretty handy.
---
If it is I hope it aint getting a fix :D
---
&gt; Like I said, no spoiler tags needed.
---
I'm pretty sure that this rule is for ingame stuff and not for the books though.

Also, would it hurt you that much to use a spoiler tag to not spoil things for others?

Technically that's how they did it in the first place. The ruined LA map wasn't the same as the actual city map; when people entered and opened the world map, everything but LA was fogged by a red mist texture, and if you altered the layers you'd see normal Tyria - the same as any dungeon.
---
EfLA/BfLA was basically an open world instance, mechanically speaking. Structured similarly to Hall of Chains, Mythwright Cauldron, every dungeon, and certain story instances like Domain of the Lost or Kormir's Sanctum.
---
It actually does still exist in the game's dat. If you used Tyria3d, you'd actually find there's 4 LA maps there - the current one, a copy of the current used for the PoF intro instance, the EfLA/BfLA map, and a pre-EfLA map used in the personal story.
---
Chances are that the S1 finale LA map is still setup for BfLA but has no means to access it, and likely still has all the code hidden behind a switch to turn it to Escape from LA.
---
Where wyverns blooooow and Norn chunder.
---
Sure, you just swap back the specialization
---
Title question: yes. It doesn’t limit your access to old weapons but some will make more sense than others given the elite spec.
---
Text question: anywhere. Once you gain the ability to use a weapon, you can use any version of that weapon, from the most basic level 2 garbage up. You can find exotics of most weapons through TP for pretty cheap.
---
&gt;can I still go back to Ranger with a bow whenever
---
You can still use a bow even if you're a soulbeast. 
---
Changing your elite spec doesn't affect the weapons that you're able to use with your core profession (ranger).
---
You can get a "free" dagger by doing the elite spec collection. Just search for it in the collections tab of your achievement panel.
---
You can keep using whatever weapons you've been using with the new elite specs, they add a weapon, not take away any.
---
You get a new dagger for main-hand (pretty sure you've been able to use daggers off-hand all along) as soon as you unlock the specialization. For more daggers, the usual methods of acquiring any weapons all apply (crafting, loot, trading post, etc.)
---
You get the key when you finish the level 10 story missions (it's a chain and the last one will give you the key).
---
Right, thank you.
---
Is okay, fortunately maining light classes anyway. Besides, can't quit before i have my ultimate dominator
---
Portals of Awakened fragments invade across Tyria. A portal of space time openes at Tomb of the Primeval King's to Kourna. There's even the rifts from S3 and that guy who mutters 97 in Fields of Ruin. Asura Infinity Ball PS has us opening rifts into the future. On top of that, all maps are stuck in time.
---
And you say a means to again access a map that is stuck in time is not fitting a game full of maps stuck in time, and full of tears of space-time leading to past, present, and future times.
---
I'm gonna disagree. Completely.
---
Uhm, the story was the biggest weakpoint of season 1. It can be described as " Scarlet bombs the plot"
---
Anet made sure that Scarlet was behind everything in Season 1 with the occasional "Alliance of the Month". Her background story had to be retconned like 2 times to make some sense.
---
Also Anet was like " We don't give out new information about her to you because this makes it more interesting" where in fact it made people loose interest in Scarlet all along. The biggest insult to it being the last scene in the Aetherpath dungeon " The only thing you found about me is something you already know"
---
Season 1 was the story at its low point, the writing was better before season 1 and after it.
---
It's undressed human female.

Well it's from the mystic forge, which means it doesn't necessarily have to be an item that previously existed

Wing 1, 2, and 3. We were never dissapointed with what we got. Wing 4 went downhill, as Teapot said, it was quite easy, but the CMs helped out alot. People were worried about what we would get for Wing 5 after that, most people thought it'd be really easy as well, and that trend would continue.
---
Needless to say for Wing 5, it didn't and we got the miracle of a fight that is Dhuum. So people were hyped for Wing 6 too. Sadly Wing 6 ended up being much like Wing 4, and Wing 7 the same. I find it confusing and sad how they can't mimic what they achieved through Wing and Wing 3, but maybe thats just how our community evolved, we're too good for those wings now, maybe Wing 6 and 7 are just like them, but we've changed instead.
---
You can try new characters in the PvP lobby as well (vs NPCs) and you'll get all your skills and specs unlocked there (as well as gear stats, you'll just need to get the cheapest weapons you can to try them too). If you're looking to get into fractals they are more focused on power damage to burst down the enemies quickly. You can check [dT's site](https://discretize.eu/builds) for the meta fractals builds. A couple of the builds (like reaper) are a little out of date so you may want to check other build sources like [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) (mainly for raids) and [metabattle](http://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) (community run builds) as well.

Superior Rune of Rage vs Superior Rune of the Scholar
---
Base stats:
---
Rage: 175 ferocity, 5% damage while Fury, 30% longer Fury
---
Scholar: 175 Power, 225 Ferocity, 5% damage above 90% health
---
In more-n-most PUGs, let alone longtime raid groups, you're going to have Fury up full time. People boon the heck out of each other after all.
---
Can supports keep you above 90% health full time? If not, look at the difference as a percentage: 175 power + 50 ferocity vs the amount of time you're under 90% health. I imagine the damage difference of 175 power and 50 ferocity can't be more than 10%, right? So, how often are you above 90% health in a pug? Half the time? 80% of the time? 95% of the time?
---
I imagine they balance out somewhat. Except the Rune of Rage helps you keep your own fury up when you're running around doing stuff solo.
---
So why do people go so crazy for the rune of the scholar?
---
What exactly is happening there?
---
I'm sorry but it's like 8 year old content. Can't expect spoiler tags. And poor etiquette... welcome to the internet, you must be new around here.
---
glad to hear it

Also, rangers should only be used in small scale wvw (like roaming or scouting), because projectile reflection screws them heavily in large scale fights (there are commanders that won't allow rangers in their squads). As a "ranger main", I'd strongly advice against building a ranger for zerging until we get a decent (for wvw) 3rd specialization or druid gets good stabs in its kit (which is extremely unlikely). Thieves are in a similar state than rangers: pretty good for small scale, subpar for large scale.
---
Guardians are solid and wanted. Firebrands outclass (by a lot) core guardians support-wise, but even with a core build you can be useful for the group, providing projectile reflection, stability, stun-breaks and heal per second. Elementalists will also work, although keep in mind that both Scourge and Herald are in a much better spot as well-rounded damage dealers and there's a higher demand for them. Elementalists are particularly good at clearing defensive tools (like cannons, arrow carts...) and dealing aoe damage in general.
---
Laurels will help you get the rings and an amulet.
---
Bitterfrost frontier is a great one for an ascended waterbreather, and one of two ascended earrings you'll need. Importantly, you can select the stats on them, so you can pick any prefix your heart of thorns desires.
---
Path of Fire has a collection to make an ascended back piece, as does heart of thorns. If you go the heart of thorns way, just don't be like me and pick an order of whispers back piece during the story when you belong to the priory of scholars or youll need another character to complete the collection.

You can check this site for the best level to open champ bags: https://silverwastes.loltools.net/
---
Nothing changed with bag opening, if you would have gotten a level 80 item it instead drops as unided, that's all. Unided before and after the change still only gives level 80 (so don't bother opening it on a lower character). You should always be "IDing" and salvaging unided gear (with the proper kits) for the best profit.

[Single Thread Performance](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html) is the best benchmark I've found for GW2.  Your CPU will determine your performance more than anything else.
---
Here is a [good guide](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/06/05/best-graphics-card-2019-2/) for picking GPUs based on what resolution you'll be playing at (GW2 is not super GPU intensive).
---
Depending on what CPU/GPU you get, make sure to buy faster RAM to match.  With many games you'll be better off with 16GB@3000MHz than 32GB@2133MHz.  buildapc subreddits will help with this.

---
Yeah... that's the obvious one that anet still doesn't want to use. Theres actually an npc in north desert highlands near a collapsed tunnel saying that it leads back to ebonhawk and not to use it even if you could
---
Wouldn't go as far as saying it was really good, but the game certainly didn't deliver it well. I played most of it back when it was available and I could swear half of the details in this recap were not actually in-game. This is the case either because they weren't or because you had to look for them like a hawk.
---
I never liked Scarlet as a character but she got the job done. Looking at it purely from what I can remember from playing it though they introduced her way to late and way too randomly. She didn't really fit my image of the silver-tongued city dweller they had been selling to us in early episodes.
---
For one, a random sylvari whose race has been part of the world for less than 25 years (implying she is younger than that, although not by much) wouldn't have the gravitas to pull all of this off in such a short timeframe. Especially not one who was slowly going/had gone certifiably insane if memory serves (or rather as we got confirmation for later).
---
Personally I don't care about how much they had to "retcon" some of her backstory into the game, e.g. through S2, because honestly a lot of that is because of the original execution of S1 so it doesn't impact the story when it is all said and done as much. On the contrary if S1 had nailed the delivery many people would simply be way more annoyed that it is not in-game in some form right now.
---
Bottom line, it is obvious that for narrative reasons she had to be a sylvari... but that is also her biggest weakness when you look at the big picture, including her obvious insanity, as she doesn't really fit the image of some great political mastermind able to orchestrate all that she did... which is why I imagine to some people her being involved in everything in S1 stung all the more and felt so forced.

Still more engaging than it was before. :^)

I've had the same problem, I swapped characters since I roleplay and I obviously didn't finish the collection in one day, then when my RP was finished for the night, swapped back to my main to finish the collection-my RP character has the buff still. Not just Dwayna's, but Almorra's!
---
&gt; you kind of just forget that the story was actually really good.
---
It wasn't good. Scarlet was so poorly written and as the main antagonist of the entire season she tainted everything.
---
It's one of them L shaped things.. and the mouse pad is on the small part of the L to my right.  So not a ton of real estate, but definitely big enough to put a mouse pad on.

Holy crap they finally fixed this to not be terrible!

The amount of timegating and random drops tied to character progression in modern WoW is why I don't play it anymore. I handled it in the previous Legion expansion because it was new and there was so much cool lore with the class halls. The AP/Azurite power grind absolutely murders playing alts and forces you to play only 1-2 characters. To have the next expansion repeat that just made me nope completely out of it and went looking for something else instead. WoW legit feels like a dead game when you see almost nobody in the open world, levelling and max level zones seem to be phased to only show a tiny number of players at a time making it such a lonely experience compared to the classic WoW of old. Most retail WoW players now seem to just login to do a weekly mythic, do their weekly raid then log off until the next week. Also a new tier of gear comes out every few months or so in WoW, the gear treadmill in that game is relentless and never stops turning if you want to have the best.
---
Found GW2 and not going back to WoW any time soon when the GW2 world is alive with players and so many things to do. So glad it's not a dying MMO either, there are so few MMOs left worth playing and WoW needs competition to kick it's ass so we get better games.
---
Have had this (and the other one for killing enemies) stuck on my characters quite literally since the collections launched.
---
Would be nice if ANet fixed it.
---
I know what you mean. I got them once and I was stunned. The legs works so good with the environment.
---
If you pug Largos feels just like any pug crusher. Same for the air boss in W7. In general it got easier but IMO it has to with the fact today we have heal scourge and heal tempest .. classes achieving 33k dps or plus without effort (back in the day only ele could do that and it was a pretty complicated rotation) and ofc the stats. Harrier for instance allowing even Druid to do some damage and heal for tons .. easy access to concentration allowing perma boons ... chronos are way easier to play, boons much more reliable .. etc ..
---
A lot has changed .. i feel like W7 is just as hard as W1 or even W2.
---
no will forever lock you out of no way of returning, also for some reason youll lose the ability to equip 2  weapon types
---
It clearly says "story content", which include books, since books are story too. 
---
Also again, both "spoilers" can be seen ingame since release and the point that Snaff is dead is a big point in the story, players get to know about it from the very beginning of GW2. Even if you ignore the books completely, there is no spoiler.
---
And still -&gt; both "spoilers" are well known facts you see ingame. SINCE RELEASE.
---
There is no "technically correct". There is no spoiler.
---
Or just use the broken af telekinesis to out your items in it.

Welcome back fwend
---
And I think with your insane AP and collections, you would know more than most. :)
---
Some problems that not a lot of people bring up with minions (as opposed to the whole totally passive/actives suck parts) is that one, they die from a lot of random AoE things (ex. no greens VG, well, enjoy your pets dying; pick up the chest in Sirens Reef, enjoy that 45 second elite cooldown right when boss spawns; are you nearly randomly targeted by Samarog, well, he will also murder your pets), and two, they dont actually scale...at all. It might not seem like the biggest deal, but in stuff like fractals, where bosses can be downed in a matter of 1-2 mins, losing 30-45 sec cooldowns for no reason means you wont resummon in most cases, and in the ones where you can, why would you resummon, wasting 2-4 seconds instead of just using normal weapon skills which will put out 20-30 seconds worth of pet DPS in the same time.
---
Don’t perfect loop doesn’t exi— hold up
---
That idea would be pretty sick! I have been hoping to see more Guild mechanics appear in the game. Having a player be able to rally allies to a specific place sounds perfect :)
---
I did enjoy the HoT raids a lot more because the fights are honestly more interesting, the game itself since PoF release has catered more to the casual playerbase. I can't say I blame them since the casuals are the biggest part of the playerbase but its absolutely disappointing as someone who prefer end game content to actually be difficult. 
---
Wing 5 was actually difficult and the fact that it took so long for groups to figure out Dhuum and effective ways to do dhuum made it a very enjoyable experience. I remember my first time killing dhuum my progression group spent a solid 6-7 hours on it before we killed it and we enjoyed the hell out of it. Then we get Wing 6, CA was gimmicky but fun the first few times, but we didn't spend more than 5-6 pulls on the boss, Largos was basically the same. Qadim was interesting purely because we didn't know what to expect, but once roles got flushed out and mechanics figured out, the fight itself is extremely low pressure. 
---
Wing 7 was a joke, the fact that normal progression took like 2hrs total is laughable. People are going to say "Oh it's SC, they're not the average players" but I was part of the 2nd group to get the full achievements (1st in NA, 2nd group behind SC overall) to finish all achievements, and it took us no more than 4.5-5hrs to get the chair and that was with us taking nearly a 45min break inbetween to give people time to eat dinner or step away from the game. 
---
ANet wants to get more players into raids, that's fair. But intentionally gimping the fights to make them "noob friendly" isn't the way to do it. Make the fights challenging, give the hardcore playerbase what they want, but also make an "infantile/baby mode" with easier dps checks, certain mechanics dumbed down or removed, and use that as a way to introduce players to raids.
---
Yes. Ghost of Ascalon, Edge of Destiny and Sea of Sorrows. If you forget you can check on the inside cover of the books. It will tell the previous books that are available.
---
Or a good joko
---
hä?
---
It happens sometimes.
---
The problem is that we are saying bold claims such as : W1 W2 and W3 were good content, challenging. W6 and W7 are trash. In the progression runs of everyone I watched, everyone was using either heal scourge or heal tempest. 
---
Go back to W2, Matt and sloth, and do it with an heal tempest or heal scourge. Is a snooze fest. You can ignore almost every mech and get away with stuff. Failed shake at sloth? No problem. Failed reflect at matt? It can wait, no one aint dying. Half the team is dead to hadouken ? Heh, no problem.
---
Things have changed and almost every discussion on this matter doesn't go deep enough, doesn't acknowledge little details like these and then ideas start brewing that the game is trash and blah blah ..
---
Because not everyone wants to raid?
---
what is a PvE track?
---
You can do them in the order but you'll miss out bit of the story or why you ended up in such situation with some characters you've met along the way. You can switch between chronicles for seasons and addons you've unlocked at any time.
---
The only 1 you can never ever do is Season 1 unfortunately.
---
Personal story - season 1 (not possible to play at all) - season 2 - HoT - Season 3 - PoF - Season 4 and we are about to start season 5.
---
This is the way it should be played if you want to follow the lore. It is stories with characters that progress together with you and if you jump in to the middle of it you wont know why this happen and how. 
---
If you are not a lore person not really caring at all then it wont matter. If you are then you do personal story and then start with season 2 and follow up with the rest in the order above. 
---
If you are a lore person then you do personal story and then watch this video who is a full recap on season 1. The only want to learn about what happen for now.  https://youtu.be/d17gwV4vXOg
---
Thank you! That second set is fantastic -- He's got a lot more of these guys on his page, as well! (like [here](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/YaR9rK).
---
Raid armor already fills the PvE legendary armor slot.
---
So basically you want the rewards that're *unique  to raids*, but not exert the **minimal** effort needed to do them?
---
**Tldr; wants rewards, but doesn't want to work for them**
---
*Sigh*
---
Oh boy.
---
Open world PvE doesn't need a set, but fractals definitely do. A few tiers of precursor skins and misty legendary armor would be a welcome addition to a game mode with no armor skins of its own.
---
you can have a macro that would trigger a diffrent key everytime you press it, that would still be ok by ANETs vague definition
---
I don't even go to the maps to get those. I play WvW and the reward track for the currency i need and do them a few times and then i have more then i need.
---
I missed the first day since I was travelling. My first clear of Wing 7 were the bosses with CM activated. I felt that the CMs for all three bosses should have just been the normal versions of it and then the CMs be another step in difficulty higher.
---
Don't wanna raid? Do PvP.
---
Don't wanna PvP? Do WvW.
---
Your armor piece need to be fixed. I'm not comfortable now. I can't see anything else.

**Contains spoilers for past Living World seasons**

If ANet were to ever revisit [that portal's area](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-531.5&amp;y=312.75&amp;z=3) leading to what seems to be [Sage Lands](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Sage_Lands) and [Majesty's Rest](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Majesty%27s_Rest) (and possibly including even [The Wilds](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Wilds_\(outpost\)) if they wanted to go for a big map with all three areas) from GW1 times, here's what I'd like to see in case they also decided to revisit some old, unfinished plots from throughout GW2 lifespan:
---
**1) The legacy of the White Mantle Hideout**
---
It would be nice getting to explore the now ruined [White Mantle Hideout](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/White_Mantle_Hideout) (which Exemplar Kerida and the Commander raided during Season 3 Episode 6) as part of this big map so it can finally appear in its rightful spot on the world map as shown in that_shaman's historical guide instead of it actually being located deep below Brisban Wildlands in the current implementation. Bonus points if it even had a sneaky portal to the Wendon Steps in Brisban. Perhaps some people or creatures took over the ruins after our successful raid, and we might even discover some additional, concealed rooms with artifacts the White Mantle spies of the Priory etc. stored there for reasons unknown with potential plot hooks for later.
---
**2) More druid and metaphysical lore in the Sage Lands**
---
For anyone who's explored the [Font of Maguuma](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Font_of_Maguuma) with a certain excited charr scholar of the Priory (out of all people!) in HoT's Auric Basin, the scholar's invocation made at the Font bears a striking resemblance to a ritual performed by druids during GW1's quest ["Wisdom of the Druids"](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_Druids) which also had some other intriguing dialogue with the Avatar of Dwayna and druid spirits:
---
&gt; **Avatar of Dwayna:** Child, Dwayna senses within you the impatience that all too often plagues the mortal mind. She now offers you an opportunity to glimpse a deeper serenity to which you may aspire. The druids of Maguuma, holy beings who surrendered their mortal flesh to become one with the jungle, will soon gather beneath a waterfall not far from here. Search through the Sage Lands for their meeting place and await them there.  
---
&gt; **Ancient Druid Spirit:** All that exists is all that must be.  
---
&gt; **Ancient Druid Spirit:** We are renewed by these waters. We are unchanged by these waters.  
---
&gt; **Ancient Druid Spirit:** Time moves neither forward or back. Time is the lens of perception.  
---
&gt; **Ancient Druid Spirit:** The spirit beholds the truths that the eye cannot see.  
---
&gt; **Ancient Druid Spirit:** It is not often that we allow mortals to witness our rituals, but we see in you the seeds of the divine. To be divine is to realize that we are all one. That the self is an illusion. Through this do you understand your own immortality. Through this are you freed from the illusions of the flesh.  
---
&gt; **Ancient Druid Spirit:** Do not rush your understanding of these mysteries. Allow them to take root and mature gradually within you as the seedling in the soil.  
---
Given the intriguing exploration of a Melandru-themed sanctuary deep within Sun's Refuge in Season 4 (giving us further clues about the origins of the strange hooded statues seen throughout Crystal Desert) and the druid lore we learned in Season 3's Draconis Mons, we could perhaps seek out mysteries of the gods and the wisdom of the druids to better understand the metaphysical aspects of Tyria that often boggle our limited mortal minds. "The spirit beholds the truths that the eye cannot see", as it were. Even better if we ran into Ewan himself from Melandru's scriptures in the Wilds to have confirmation if he really was one of the first druids, originally a selfish and godless nature-destroying person who underwent a transformation under Melandru's watchful gaze to become an atoning figure dedicated to preserving nature in a kind of parallel to Saul-Paul situation from the Bible:
---
&gt; And it was that a tribe of godless humans wandered the land. Where camped did they lay waste, senselessly destroying everything nearby.  
---
&gt; And so the tribe set out to find another camp, when suddenly sprouted a wall of thorny branches, which blocked their exit.  
---
&gt; Then saith Ewan, leader of the tribe, "Know ye our ways. Whosoever does magic in this tribe shall be put to death."  
---
&gt; Yet none comes forward. Then, from the earth grows forth a large tree, and unfurling its branches, reveals the upper torso of a woman. Saith She, "I am Melandru, the Mother of earth and nature. Henceforth I bind ye to these lands. When they suffer, so shall ye suffer."  
---
&gt; And as She saith, so was it done. From their limbs sprouted branches, and the blood in their veins was the sap of trees. Then was Ewan and his tribe converted, and became they stewards of nature.  
---
Perhaps Ewan's wisdom could be paired with the Pale Tree's poetic tellings of the "Soul of Tyria" weeping upon Riannoc's death, and we learn why the White Mantle viewed Kryta as a goddess as revealed in Forsaken Thicket raids' books (maybe it was less metaphorical and there's actually a deeper meaning similar to how the druids viewed the Maguuma as a living, breathing entity that wasn't just the jungle but something much more and not something related to Mordremoth). Would be a nice tie-in to explore more of the lore of the Dream and Nightmare's origins, especially as the Crystal Bloom Camp in S4's Dragonfall recently had curious [ambient dialogue](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystal_Bloom_Camp#Ambient_dialogue) about the nature of nightmare as a kind of "elemental" force in Menzies's Shadow Army:
---
&gt; **Crystal Bloom Blade:** We can't hold this position forever. You've got Branded on one side, living shadow things on the other...  
---
&gt; **Crystal Bloom Weaver:** The shadows aren't actually alive. Think of them more like magical constructs.  
---
&gt; **Crystal Bloom Blade:** What, like elementals?  
---
&gt; **Crystal Bloom Weaver:** If nightmares were an element, yes. In fact, some believe our nightmares possess innate power similar to the elements.  
---
For a long time now GW2 narrative has focused itself more on solving problems with science, but Ogden has reminded us that despite their intellect, asura can't fathom the entirety of the All yet alone the Eternal Alchemy itself as these metaphysical concepts and the Mists itself go beyond our senses and limited understanding. Where we once sought science for answers to our problems, we should also be mindful of the mysticism of the norn shamans, Koda, and Spirits of the Wild, the mysteries of the gods, the "soul" of Tyria and its ultimate purpose and how Dream(s) and Nightmare(s) are related to it, and how our perceptions of time, self and soul are subjective and open to new interpretations.

**3) Steam creature civilization and the return of Riot Alice**
---
One of the curious discoveries of Season 2 was the reveal of Scarlet having created two batches of steam creatures as shown in ["Prosperity's Mystery"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prosperity%27s_Mystery):
---
&gt; **Ceara:** I may have created a new sentient being. My steam brains are mimicking my building techniques, designing their own version of the steam portal. [...]  
---
&gt; **Scarlet Briar:** The steam brains have shown ingenuity. When threatened, they build steam minotaurs from whatever materials they can find.  
---
&gt; **Scarlet Briar:** I've used a portal to send most of my steam creature prototypes into Lornar's Pass and Brisban Wildlands. I no longer need them.  
---
The interesting thing here is that we never really meet the Brisban batch of steam creatures. The Lornar batch we encounter in Lornar and emerging from an asura gate in a dynamic event in Brisban. The other confirmed steam creature sighting in Brisban occurred during the asura personal's story Infinity Ball narrative branch where those steam creatures were fractal anomalies associated with our asura's evil fractal anomaly self, the [Grand High Sovereign](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mysterious_Stranger) (who lied when he/she claimed to have come from an alternate Tyria's future where he/she had invented the steam creatures and taken over the world), and thus were unrelated to Scarlet per se.
---
Given the size the Lornar batch grew into over the years and the odd lack of any steam creature activity in present day Brisban, it means something must've happened to the Brisban batch since Scarlet released them. So, what if the Brisban batch journeyed north of the bandit bridge to the new map containing the three GW1 areas?
---
It would be interesting if, unlike their savage Lornar cousins, these Sage Lands steam creatures instead experienced a "bug" in their system to take another evolutionary approach. While still more of a neutral than "good" force, they could've embraced the ideas of a less aggressive civilization, choosing to preserve knowledge than try to conquer lands. The first Steam Brain of the Brisban batch could view itself as a Mother Brain and could've preserved Scarlet's information in its data banks, eventually constructing a mecha avatar for itself with Scarlet's appearance in honor of the "Machine Mother"; and if ANet wanted to go full fan service, they could bring back Tara Strong to voice this "Mecha Scarlet".
---
As Scarlet was not always corrupted by Mordremoth and was fighting against his influence for a while with her own plans to rid Tyria of Elder Dragons in preparation for her own world, perhaps the Mother Brain had some secret, new info about Scarlet's plans which we can put to use when confronting the remaining Elder Dragons should Bubbles, Primordus or Jormag prove to be too dangerous to be contained. Given how steam creatures' thick chassis and mix of organic and synthetic material seems to make them impervious to dragon corruption, they could be convinced to join our fight against the dragons and become frontline troops with Exalted-level durability and immunity to hamper the dragons' attempts to grow their armies. Thus Scarlet's knowledge and the help from these steam creatures would fulfill [Scarlet's prophetic message to Caithe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spinal_Blade_Pack_Blueprint) with a twist: "Caithe, someday you'll see, Tyria needs me."
---
Another neat twist here could be the involvement of the lovely paranoid [Riot Alice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Riot_Alice) whom we last saw in Prosperity in Dry Top before it was destroyed by Mordy's vines between S2 Episodes 1 and 2 and whose fate ANet hasn't revealed yet. Perhaps, while seeking out more info on the bandits' activities to learn more about a great conspiracy, Alice stumbled close to the White Mantle's headquarters but was intercepted by the Brisban batch of steam creatures who wished to study humanity. It would be pretty funny if Alice ended up contributing to the creation of a new civilization from scratch in this unlikely alliance, helping these "newborn" steam creatures come to understand morality and what society should stand for to create a kind of utopia in the jungle even if it would still be interpreted by the steam creatures' "alien" thought patterns.
---
Alice's reunion with the Commander in the Wilds could also get her involved in another subplot in the next section.
---
**4) Majesty's Rest, the mystery of Rotscale, and continuing the story of the Krytan Locket and the Heir of Ascalon**
---
[Rotscale](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Rotscale) was an undead dragon roosting at Majesty's Rest, a tomb for Krytan royalty, to guard a powerful weapon within for reasons that were his alone to know. In GW1 beta there was a since scrapped quest where he would've been fought in the Shiverpeak Mountains where the evil dwarven Stone Summit had raised him from the dead in preparation for invading Ascalon, and his arrival from the Shiverpeaks was later canonized in [the Scribe's writings](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Scribe/20060713). Curiously Rotscale raise those he had slain as his undead servants to boost his forces, making him a kind of pre-Zhaitan in a way although there's no connection between Rotscale's necromancy and Zhaitan's Risen corruption as far as we know.
---
During GW2's Season 2, a notable subplot involved a prophecy according to which the Foefire curse can only be cleansed if the heir bears [King Adelbern's crown](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/King_Adelbern%27s_crown) and Sohothin or Magdaer (or both swords depending on how you interpret the wording) as stated by Logan. We also know that the Krytan royal locket mentioned in ["The Concordia Incident"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Concordia_Incident) always shows the current heir to the Krytan throne which could be used to help locate the Ascalonian heir eventually if there's any connection between Krytan heir and Ascalonian heir as Logan does mention the possibility due to more than one family being descended from King Doric in ["Reunion with the Pact"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reunion_with_the_Pact) and ["Return to Camp Resolve"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reunion_with_the_Pact):
---
&gt; **Character name:** The Krytan royal locket?  
---
&gt; **Magister Lindsay:** It's a magical locket. It's said to always have the image of the current heir to the throne of Kryta displayed inside it. It's quite beautiful.  
---
&gt; **Character name:** It sounds powerful.  
---
&gt; **Magister Lindsay:** Very powerful. And coveted. We move it from fort to fort on an irregular schedule. I probably shouldn't even be telling you about it, but...you're you.  
---
&gt; **Logan Thackeray:** So, he had Sohothin and the crown of the Ascalonian king who set the curse in the first place. I see why he thought it might actually work. The legend says only an heir... [...]
---
&gt; **Logan Thackeray:** For the ritual to be successful, it must be performed by the current Ascalonian ruler.  
---
&gt; **Character name:** Well, the Ascalon line is dead.  
---
&gt; **Logan Thackeray:** Prince Rurik may have had no children, but you're forgetting that all humans come from a single source. Both Krytan and Ascalonian royalty descended from King Doric.  
---
&gt; **Character name:** Where are you going with this, Logan?  
---
&gt; **Logan Thackeray:** Nowhere really. Just thinking aloud and worrying about what trouble Rytlock has gotten himself into. It won't be the same without him here.  
---
The Order of Whispers is aware that there is actually another descendant of the royal line who could reign should anything happen to Jennah as teased in ["The Sad Tale of the 'Ravenous'"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Sad_Tale_of_the_%22Ravenous%22):
---
&gt; **Scholar Josir:** We can't allow anything to happen to Queen Jennah. She's the last of the royal line!  
---
&gt; **Agent Ihan:** Perhaps not the last... but you're right. Without Queen Jennah, we'd lose our treaty with the charr.  
---
&gt; **Crusader Hiroki:** More than that. Without Queen Jennah, the nation will lose hope. It would be the end of Kryta.  
---
So it could be that the Foefire prophecy and the Krytan locket plots are intertwined due to the loophole that the Krytan heir could be one of the lost descendants of Doric. Perhaps exploring Majesty's Rest would help advance this storyline, especially if some nefarious party managed to injure Jennah with magic or poison so she'd require a specific cure to be revived, and the evil party got hold of the Krytan locket and fled there with intentions to use it for their own ends, and we'd learn more about Rotscale's past and why he was so adamant on guarding, rather than consuming, the powerful artifact(s) within the human-centric mausoleum. We might need Riot Alice's skills to help navigate the treacherous location, and perhaps get some of our steam creature "friends" to assist her too if this plot was paired up with the aforementioned Mother Brain scenario. Perhaps the mausoleum could likewise provide clues to the lost heirs of Doric and the early history of humanity and Kryta and Ascalon's origins being tied to Orr.
---
These are just some of the many ideas that the narrative could explore with our exploration of a map beyond Brisban's bandit bridge. I at least hope the Heir of Ascalon and Foefire curse are explored with or without exploring Majesty's Rest and the surrounding areas, perhaps via the return of the ghosts of Prince Rurik and Lady Althea to the story so they can reconcile with King Adelbern and Duke Barradin's ghosts, maybe even tying it all to an overarching "Cogs of War" storyline involving a potential Blood Legion insurrection headed by Blood Imperator Bangar Ruinbringer. Lots of possibilities out there. :)
---
A lot of these unfinished areas are surprisingly well mapped, in part (I would assume) because they generate the collision data from the base geometry for the terrain, rather than anything too fancy.
---
After all, one of these early out of bounds areas has a chair you can sit in. A lot of it is entity/mesh based.
---
I hadn't been back since I got the skyscale but that is highly disappointing.
---
Very true, though I'd be fine with those instances remaining walled off.
---
I use the [Redragon Mousepad](https://www.amazon.com/Redragon-ARCHELON-Stitched-Waterproof-Large-Size/dp/B00NV4XL62/), since it was pretty cheap. I must say, it has actually held up really well, and it's pretty thick. Right now, I have it on a glass desk and I had to make my monitor start wobbling from rocking the whole desk back and forth before it started shifting.
---
Raids are PvE content.
---
&gt; a new tier of gear comes out every few months or so
---
This would drive me insane. There is no way someone could take a break from the game.
---
yea i have HoT and PoF!
---
endgame content is usually repeatable (harder) content which rewards you.  
---
while you can replay the story, it won't reward you in any way if you didn't do it on a new character.  
---
also replaying the story everyday is not what everyone does the whole time. hence, its not endgame.
---
You mean old skin. 
---
Its a ghostly version of this skin. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legionnaire_Sword_(skin)
---
and
---
Like your example here the sword, staff and bow are also used in the guild mission here https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Langmar_Estate_(guild_puzzle)
---
Its not a new skin, its just now available for us to use. Im happy that we can now get it, but just because its now attainable for the player doenst make it new.

&gt; But not everyone wants to raid.
---
Then they wont get legendary armor. Not everyone wants to do fotm thats fine but it also means they wont get Ad Infinitum. Not everyone wants to play pvp again thats fine but that also means they wont get The Ascension, same for wvw rewards and pve rewards for those players that only pvp/wvw.
---
If you happen to speak german you can use guildnews.de, they are guides for pretty much everything new.
---
Did Wooden Potatoes ever finish his audiobook read of them?
---
I would go with 2 more ways to upgrade ascended armor into legendary armor:
---
* Update the fractal armor boxes in the Bling vendor to have its own skin set, Fractal Armor that would have a mate and raw metal finish, and add a way to upgrade them to a legendary Golden Fractal armor set that would be be shinier reskin of Fractal Armor and have a reflective metal finish.
---
* Upgrade Illustrious armor, the set from crafting and drops. This method would be the grindiest, but also the easiest.  The skin would be mostly the same, maybe with glowing dyeable bits.
---
That way we'd have 5 avenues to get legendary armor: Raids, WvW, PvP, Fractals and a final general PvE/cross-mode
---
Regardless of to whom that point was directed towards, that was the mindset you enabled the moment you posted it.
---
Coddling people in a game mode that needs no coddling makes no sense.
---
Now I'm curious where it is o. O
---
So basically people wanna do nothing and get the rewards. Fair enough, ok I will fuck off now.
---
P.S.: I'm wondering why you people even playing MMORPG?
---
Also funny note, I think its much more likely to lose players to the Zhaitan fight than to the lack of LS1 :) 
---
A full re-implementation at this point would affect a great portion of the community, I think. Many people came in around HoT where the game went free to play. So I think LS1 has value for current players. 
---
But just like you say, new maps, new raids and xpacs will always have more value because it will affect all players. Trying to rebuild LS1 based on the fact that "it could bring new players" is a foolish belief. I think personal story and its shortcuts would be much more of a downer that a lack of LS1.
---
Do you know what would fix that? Additional difficulties!
---
&gt; I do raid. Not often but I do. I also don't give 2 shits about Legendary armor because I have full ascended thanks to Fractals/WvW/PvP. 
---
How does that equal _do nothing_ to you fuckwit?
---
If they don't want to do either of the three options they will simply have to accept that they won't be able to aquire a legendary armor. It's not like they will need it in the open world anyways.
---
That’s so gay
---
Wait so you can't be proud of being straight? You have to be LGBTQ+ to be proud? Why put down anyone who is proud of who they are? Being proud of who you are doesn't belittle people and it doesn't diminish the strides we as a culture and society have made towards gay rights and the way people are treated.
---
That’s a bug, pls report to ANet. I would be pissed too if that happens to me.
---
Dangit, I forgot about this.
---
May all your rainbows shine strong!
---
And you are the frontrunner and sole reason gays are now being accepted in society? Or what's the reason you gotta get insulting?
---
["i was born, and i was like, okay, i feel different from absolutly nobody. and now im an adult and i still feel totally fine because the world is totally made for me"](https://twitter.com/evaandheriud/status/1136019996436508673)
---
It was so much fun! Can't wait for next year's.
---
Because the essence of Pride isn't about celebrating your own sexuality. It's to remind people that we exist and we want equal rights. It's to remind others that insulting us, hurting us, or even killing us, wont change anything rather strengthen the preserverence. Pride isn't just for "gay" people. Pride is for anyone that wishes to support the LGBTQ+ community and use their voice for equal rights. That includes straight people which are known as allies.
---
I hope you now understand why there is no such thing as straight Pride.
---
I do hate invisible walls and hitting a ledge I am not allowed to stand on. It stinks. I remember in my first year I found that out of bounds “weird room” outside of Caudecus’s manor. It was an amazing find!
---
Still, Gaming is both art and business and many artists/businesses would prefer to control what their audiences see. Unused assets and barren patches of the environment, though sometimes cool to us, would be seen as an oversight and weak spot in their eyes. It just takes a few players to go “ugh, look at this useless corner” or “wow, look at this lazy map design - they literally stuck a building inside of a mountain” to discredit their work. 
---
I do hope though that MMOs in general start to think outside of the box when it comes to map geometry. Plan map borders to match the geometry rather than trying to design in a box. Use “environmental effects” to keep players away or even place unstoppable enemies/hazards in certain areas to naturally ward away players.
---
If we ever get the Deep Sea Dragon, I would hope that it would push map mechanics a bit further! Underwater currents that can “Jackal-port” you to other maps via the ocean. Multi-map metas where you fight different Hydra heads! (Would need more resources on inter-map communications and multi-instance pairing)
---
I'm pretty sure that Matt Visual has not touched GW2 for a long long time. I don't think they asked him permission to use his old video but am happy to be wrong.
---
Elite spec is not a class change
---
It's just like any other spec but it alters the playstyle more significantly

I have ten charged quartz but my jewellers isn’t leveled at all. I don’t really want to go through the time and money to level it to 400, but I also want to be able to used my ten charges quartz for the grow lamp. 
---
My question is will getting jewellers to max level benefit me in the future if I bite the bullet now? I find leveling crafting pretty tedious but I don’t mind too much if I know that it would benefit me like all the other crafting disciplines do. 
---
Are there a lot of things that I need jewellers maxes to get?
---
It's just a recap video. He's doing a full let's play of gw2 and is up to season 1 so he did this since the content is no longer available.
---
As a heterosexual, I kind of disagree. Gay Pride, as I see it, is about overcoming adversity and fighting for a better world for yourselves and the future of your entire community. I'm here to celebrate that alongside, because you deserve that celebration. This whole 'Straight Pride' thing just completely hijacks it and belittles the hardships others have faced, just because we don't like feeling excluded from anything ever. Instead of being on the sidelines cheering, they're running onto the field demanding to have their own celebration because its not fair you get one.
---
I've got plenty to be proud of, but being straight, or white, or male aren't those things. It's like being proud of having eyeballs or fingers.
---
Well.. TV shows that's exactly in the way of "Hey I'm gay, deal with that or i will sue you for you not allowing me to fuck your ass"
---
Are you take full of hate for someone being straight?
---
They just need to let enemies be pushed off of ledges.
---
I like most of what you said, but on the subject of story, that's an issue, not necessarily for me, but for the community in general. After the personal story, players complained quite loudly, that they felt one of the characters had stolen their thunder and that they didn't feel like a hero.  I suspect at least part of this was due to the popularity of Skyrim where one character could do everything. You could be the head of the warriors guild, the mages guild, the thieves guild, while being a werewolf.  It was sorta weird to me and I didn't like it much but clearly it was popular.
---
So people complained and the further you got into the story the more important your character became. And a lot of it was Anet reacting to complaints, or perhaps over-reacting. But it's true, many many times I saw complaints about being in the personal story not feeling like THE hero. So there's that.
---
Just thought you might like a bit of backstory.
---
First thought was, "Is that really something that portal can turn you into?!", then I read it was a tonic. I have been turned into some weird things just falling for long periods of time into that.
---
You’re kind of missing the point of pride events. 
---
It’s not necessarily about being “proud” as much as it is a statement that the LGBTQ+ community exists, and wants their voice to be heard and respected in everything from law to media representation. Being proud to be LGBTQ+ is just a side effect of these celebrations. 
---
That kind of thing doesn’t necessarily apply to straight people, since there hasn’t been historical persecution from government entities and subcultures/communities to them.
---
You can be proud to be straight sure, but that doesn’t really hold a lot of weight since being straight is so widely accepted just about everywhere as a normal thing. Wanting a straight pride event just screams insecurity, at least to me lol.
---
You might wanna google the definition of pride.
---
Being proud of something that isn't widely accepted as a normal thing doesn't hold a lot of weight either.
---
That's why they are doing this kind of events.
---
Disclaimer: I'm a straight white male.
---
This whole 'straight pride' thing just strikes me as whining. It's like if you get cake every day of your life, but complain the one time someone else gets cake and you didn't. I find it to be incredibly insulting actually. I take pride in what I've accomplished or adversity I've overcome, telling me I should be proud of being straight is like telling me I should be proud of having eyeballs. Why? What about the shit I've actually done and actually overcome. I don't need to shit on someone else's cake in order to feel good about myself.
---
Go to any bank, there's a wardrobe tab with (almost) every skin in the game for you to preview.
---
OP stated they does not have any expansions (yet), core guard in a zerg is sufficient enough in the right hands but you need to play it safe. While I am aware FB is miles better (and OP should defs get the xpacs if he is serious about WvW), no one can deny the usefulness of SYG + traited stab on F3 let alone the boons provided anyway, all of which are built into the core design of guardian to begin with.
---
I hope you aren't implying OP simply shouldn't bother playing WvW if he doesn't have expansions for elite specs. WvW can be fun even with core classes.
---
Granted, I've had years of experience which might not be mimic'd by a new player, regardless, having played full clerics core guard on alt accounts and have done just fine in all out zerg settings, the only problem being low HP prone to spike/bomb dmg.
---
I mean just pick almost any story from anywhere? Every action movie, comic novel, tv series etc. always represent straight people as the main characters where any LBGT+ at best become a side character. As a gay person myself I can’t say I’m too bothered by it but the fact that some straight people like yourself demand equality for a society that represents you literally eveywhere by default, you really make my blood boil. It’s a parade in a video game, so let’s not make a bigger deal then it has to be jeez
---
Oh ok ty! And I guess there will be weapons too?
---
Can you make light armor look like heavy or no?
---
I’m pretty sure he’s doing an /s moment bud
---
Ok this is the info i've been needing. I really like that discussions of this game go to the fraction of a percent like this and have concrete numbers to back it up. Im still new to group content and though I know most groups are "full glass cannon" and rely on supports to stay alive and boonswozzled, the fact that this is so violently *not* the case in solo content is what's had me wondering. Thank you!
---
Brighton?
---
Just dropping by to say that I feel bummed too. Invisible walls suck, especially on places that were previously available for years, or some random ledges that look like you can totally land on.. But you can't. \o/
---
You can, but I would highly recommend acro trait line for the one trait that gives "evade" or invul I forget the name since there's an abundance of one shot builds out there, mirage, sbeast, holo chain cc are real pains if you get hit by their burst.
---
Another thing worth mentioning is fighting near enemy objectives one of the more recent changes people seem to forget is you cannot stay in stealth as long since sentries/tiered up objectives apply reveal on you if so.... yeah.
---
Good luck.
---
Do gay people typically demand that you let them fuck you in the ass?
---
Well we can celebrate for being straight too right?
---
All colours of the rainbow
---
Yes, weapons are there too! You can't use an armor skin outside your profession's weight class, but there are a few sets here and there that look like a different weight. Just browse through and you'll see.
---
Its so fucking stupid to exclude straight people
---
The thing is, you need to balance it.
---
You can't appeal to *only* hardcore players.
