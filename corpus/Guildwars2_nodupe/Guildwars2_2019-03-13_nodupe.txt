I feel you. I think the game's biggest issue in terms of balance is that there is too much sustain without building it for some classes but get to equip damage amulets and do significant damage, like holo/spellbreaker/soulbeast who can run paladin/maurader and heal as much or more than an elementalist who builds almost exclusively for defense and sustain with mender. Also some classes are allowed insane amounts of sustain and team ability like scrapper (sure, no damage, but even bunker FB dies eventually). Then you have classes that either build damage but have near no sustain, or build sustain but are the definition of a nuisance far-stall-self-healing-troll wet-noodle, eles currently for nearly 3 years now since tempest was pile-screwed to the ground due to HoT meta with chronobunkers and scrappers, where after they nerfed those 2 offending classes where ele was covering their hp while they were waiting CDs, they never buffed back the eles.

Spoiler: Balthazar dies.
---
Ty for the insight. So it would be best to assume i should hit 85% bd with food and top it off with fractals potion ? 85% will be good enough for raids aswell i am guessing?
---
I know, I’m caught up. Not everyone else is. 
---
drop the bow and use a scepter
---
Some pve commanders are just draining and wasting supps for no reason. If you have no idea what to do. Don't tag up.
---
Me too, but the truth is? There isn't even one there that I like. So, nope!
---
I took like a year ish break at one point. And since then I basically only play maybe 3-5 hours during the week and maybe another 5ish on the weekends depending. I was playing much more before the break.
---
PvP can't thrive until they prevent relogging to swap characters. I mean it is hella abused in duo queue and solo queue might remedy that a bit, but even randoms would ask to swap to get the ideal team comp. 
---
I'm honestly not sure after these recent changes but yes you should be aiming for 85% in fractals (assuming 150 AR and potion) and I *think* raids will be fine around there though they may want to increase it more now that you don't get as much from soi (and therefor the other chrono as well).
---
Didn’t see anyone post about this and it also wasn’t listed in Dulfy’s post so figured I would. I know it’s exactly enticing, but figured it’s good to let those who can’t log in know. 
---
Right, thanks for reminding me about that effect of IM.  It's not always visible when it triggers (or when it's off ICD).
---

---
(I'd argue if your'e in a situation where you need an "oh shit" reflect, OLE is not exactly going to save you in the next five seconds unless you're already in earth.)
---
Aftershock is the fastest of the bunch.  But you're right, SS will PROBABLY have you covered.
---
Well, at least you made me laugh! I know that bow is bad. I switched recently from something also bad and I’ve been clueless about affixes which is much improved thanks to all you lovely people today. I’d replace it with a better bow but it looks like everyone says scepter instead so that’s what I’ll do.
---
And here I thought you were done. You make the claim i'm offended, yet you're the one who starting with the insult 🤔. You seem more bothered then me tbh. 
---
But anecdotal evidence? I see your trying out the big words. But in all your lacking wisdom, please do point it out? Not once did I say what will make the most money. Hell, it was never about what made more money, until you brought it up. This is where reading comprehension comes in. And my original statement of you reading what I have said thus far. Which you still haven't done. Instead doubling down. 
---
If I might make a suggestion. Try reading first, THEN making a comment. That's normally how I do it but hey, that's just me. 
---
so what? dailies, fractals, open world metas and whatnot already reset at..well, reset time
---
people already plan around that
---
it would be just a small yet greatly appreciated QoL
---
At times it feels neglected? The mode has been totally neglected since they scrapped the pro comp and all the pvp devs left. Yes the combat system is good, pvp as a mode is a joke because its totally stale and needs major changes.
---
Neither were afterthoughts, they wanted spvp to be an esport. In the original game design WvW was clearly supposed to be a major endgame activity.
---
&gt;I do not enjoy the firebrand-scourge meta and will not return to this game mode for as long as this meta remains. 
---
This is why we need new expac, because Anet has failed to demonstrate they can balance or shift the meta up to prevent it being stale. FB/Scourge has been meta from Week 1 PoF... 
---
Thanks again for your information.
---
$49.6K, what an achievement! My tarot set arrived today and my WDZ arrived a few weeks ago... They are both amazing products and so well done. The passion you (and the artists) have for GW2 and for creating unique, high quality memorabilia really shows. They'll be treasures for years to come!
---
Me too, me too. I am so sad I missed out.
---
It is said that song can hit your heart. I guess he decide to test it with proper stat set.
---
I have to get back to the final part of HoT as well. I died so much and figured I knew the outcome enough to continue on. If you want to try it together sometime let me know. I have kids as well and totally get the up and down. Lots of good advice here so I don't have much to add other than to say getting my ascended trinkets and ascended weapon has really helped. Also choosing the right food and utilities (and remembering to use them) gives a little extra boost.
---
And pack polyaks, and the golden moa near Vet. Harpy
---
Is it just me, or does Daredevil Bo staff fifth skill, the leap doesn't do damage in preemptive attack? I've tried it in multiple occasion hoping to catch enemies by surprise by leaping into them, but no damage. Only when i'm in battle and using the leap skill i see the damage dealt. Did i do something wrong?
---
It is pretty crazy how different the stats are of a zerger vs roamer.
---
I have almost the same WvW level as you but with 1/5th of your kill total.
---
Also, what do you spend your badges on?
---
Do you farm on all your toons? For me I cycle between 2 main farmer toons so not affected by daily reset. Eg. Odd dates: Daredevil, even dates: Quickbrand. Then farm on other toons if I'm not lazy. 
---
so sPvP doesn't matter since it uses separate stats and "gear". You could do sPvP just the same on a level 2 character in white gear as a level 80 in ascended so we'll ignore that. For WvW you'll want different gear compared to PvE (and honestly ranger and thief are roamers that you don't want in a zerg (large group of players in WvW)). 
---
Fractals prefer power for DPS (and it's much easier to gear first so always my suggestion). [Soulbeast](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast) (Ranger, PoF) , [Deadeye](https://discretize.eu/builds/thief/power-deadeye) (Thief, PoF), and [Daredevil](https://discretize.eu/builds/thief/power-daredevil) (Thief, Hot) though deadeye doesn't have as much cleave as the others and needs back stabs for optimal DPS.
---
As for [raids](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) pDPS (power DPS) [DE](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/deadeye/power/) (Deadeye) and [DD](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/daredevil/power/) (Daredevil) are top DPS builds, pDPS [SB](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/) (Soulbeast) and cDPS (condition DPS) [SB](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/condition/) are also very strong though condi is harder to gear.
---
Honestly both are great choices in PvE, I'd suggest pDPS DD or pDPS SB just depending on if you want to hit things with bears or tumble all over them.
---
Labels would be icing on the cake!
---
or some sort of overflow bug in the distance calculations
---
No they'll just split them in a couple weeks and get the best of both worlds.  They will have already cashed in on the whales and impulsive folks who will drop 2000 gems (but might not if there was a 500 gem option), then get all the extra good will from reddit threads that say "Thanks for listening, Anet!" and pick up all the people who would only want to spend 500.
---
Those moas ... I remember hitting one and having it teleport
---
Yea it sucks because you have no idea what they will be until its too late. So if you load in and they swap to counter your team comp youre fucked. One of the most frustrating things ever. 
---
All the items in that collection is from the first 3 raid wings thus Cairn doesn't add to the collection. 
---
Congratulations on the first kill!
---
Have you had naming issues in the past? First time offenders usually get to pick their name unless it was something super heinous. 
---
If it was your first offense then you can try and appeal to them. But if you're a frequent flier I wouldn't hold any hope. 
---
Weird. I've been temporarily banned 3 times for LGBT-related names because they're supposedly too sexual. But, each time I got banned I got a free name change for that character. I would definitely send an appeal for them to mail you a name change item.
---
Happened to me once on spirit woods. Weird bug. I THINK (this happened a while ago) that I was outside the pressure plates area when it happened, but I can't be sure. 
---
I had autoloot enabled and there simply was no chest at all. 
---
*Casually saves for for future reference because he too is interested in Cantha.*

It depends. [Can it be made into a mobile game and reallocated to a studio in South Korea?](https://www.mmorpg.com/news/ncsoft-doubles-down-on-mobile-mmos-and-sequels-aion-2-blade-and-soul-2-and-more-1000050453)
---
I'm guessing I made around 200 ranks, moving me up to Diamond Assaulter. Doesn't really mean much at this point though. I didn't count other stats. 
---
It was fun with a week of blobbing but I'm enjoying seeing more organized fights again now and hopefully some fun small scale stuff.
---
Interesting as we have one confirmation that it may not. The in-game text actually states that it will be destroyed but then again so does the one for blood ruby jewelry too.
---
The wiki says sometimes it destroys and sometimes it doesn't, meaning there's a bug or the tooltip wasn't updated. Either way, it doesn't really inspire too much confidence. 
---
You're definitely underplaying the issue by referring to it ad "non-RP." lol

---
Well shit^^^^itwasworththepun Sorry to hear that, hopefully they gave you a free name change contract to fix the name they gave you and simply omitted it from their notice?  
---
Ah, yeah. When I'd run AB with some friends generally we'd kill the breacher and adds it spawns on our side before the first burn. Armors are good for breaking CC and group res, but that's it.
---
Then maybe they should try a different approach.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Because a lot of people only buy the expansions, so your argument has very little weight. ANet made a choice for no sub fee and then decided fashion wars was going to be their sustained payment model.
---
The amount of content released between expansions is apparently consumed by the pvE community in under 2 hours every 3 months and then ignored. I just play WvW and PvP so I've been used to 7 years of no content. A bad map with HoT and a few bad weeks of different rulesets, since they removed the yournaments it's been downhill.
---
&gt; GW2 doesn't really have much in the way of microtransaction loot boxes
---
except the literal loot boxes..
---
I'm actually also a roamer but you're completely right that the bulk of my stats are definitely because of me playing in a zerg (15-20 player guild groups usually) and I could see in my stats previously how smaller my amount of kills per day increased but yeah, to be expected.
---
Buy badge of tribute from the guild hall WvW vendor and sell on TP.
---
Thank you, and congrats on snagging one of the last copies of TT!
---
&gt; anet fundamentally underestimated the amount of work and money needed 
---
Story of GW2's entire lifespan.
---
For some reason, Linsey Murdock completely dismissed the idea of bank tab labels ever being added. Maybe it's a memory/storage/programming issue, but perhaps we could at least ask for the ability to hide the tab headers like we can hide our bag names.
---
Wtf is that??????
---
&gt;I opened all (exept rare gear) on a L50 character with enough magic find boost for more expensive materials.
---
Magic find does not affect those bags.
---
&gt;I only got ~60g after 6 hours. Am I having bad rng, am I doing something wrong
---
You’re probably underfarming. Are you tagging all events? Are you looting bandit chests during both meta &amp; chest train?
---
Maybe someone who farms the wastes could tell you how many bags+purses+pouches per hour you should be able to get.
---
[removed]
---
Dye packs are honestly the worst thing on the gemstore but people forget about them. There is no guarantee to get at least 1 of the new set, big scam.
---
I'm honestly heart broken I found out about this a month after it was over :( I would have been overjoyed to partake and buy this beautiful collection 
---
If you boosted you should have a few way points unlocked in core tyria. Not that many but a few. You can also go unlock the ranger to fast travel by doing the first mission of pof 
---
You mean TT? The other is still available in limited quantities. 
---
"to get stuck on the spot until the mount is sufficiently loaded and the client eventually catches up"
---
I've had this bug a lot and all my mounts have the Halloween skin. So it is not as clear if custom skins make bugs happen less.
---
Thanks a lot, man!
---
WHAT?! BRB WHERES MY WALLET. MA. MAAAAA!
---
Be a commander and lead people to success, mostly new players. They'll love you to death. 
---
WDZ 17 is 100% gone outside of the postcards.
---
TT is sold out except for scuffed Eternity and Flameseeker pins, and A-grade world completions. We also have postcards and vinyl stickers left.
---
WDZ 18 has the book, giftboxes, card, dice and a small amount of pins leftover.
---
Sometimes I get so annoyed, I don't bother to wait. I don't try to farm the nodes, on a regular basis I do not farm the nodes anymore, and also I will just leave game for awhile. It gets too overwhelming, and more likely I just get disheartened. Why I focus on home instance and gh's and ocassionally wvw. 
---
It isn't really exploiting since you don't need to buy the skins. They give you no advantage whatsoever.
---
The best dev appeal would probably to leave things the way they are and don't do any work at all
---
+1 for Cantha ref. Nice use of green + red btw!
---
No 
---
Well then we will see her again 😉
---
this is an mmo, it's not overwatch and it's not lol where you log in and have champ select. There is a massive time investment put in your character and with only 9 classes it's expected that you can pick any class in character creation and be useful in all game modes.
---
I’d also like a “stack” function where items of the same type that occupy different thank slots now automatically stack together. 
---
You guys did great work! I love my Tyrian Tarot set so much!
---
Warclaws are gassy beasts
---
I'm really sad we won't be getting a new Xpac after season 4. I hope we at least get elite specs. I have pretty much completely lost interest in the game. I have big doubts about them being able to introduce massive game changing features through Living World only, and this game desperately needs one because one story every 3 months isn't really working, at least for me.
---
[Yeah, no problem](https://we.tl/t-eS9ns4VbzN)
---
I did Abaddon's while going for ls3 map complete with my warrior, I saw a big thing and climbed it, it really felt organic, "see the platform, jump on it" and actually fun.  
---
I usually hate JP's, especially those in which you don't know the way forwards (looking at you, ember bay and draconis mons), but this one was a breeze. The view was amazing and I never felt like something was engineered to be a "try 4 times unitl you figured where you should have gone the first time" or a pixel perfect jump.  
---
Best JP in the game by far  
---
The endgame is what you want it to be. For me it is collecting minis. And it is called 'Fashion Wars' for a reason. ;)
---
And fyi, you can unlock skins from salvaging weapons and armors. You prob already know. There are also easy and harder achievements, like killing types of foes , using types of weapons , and getting all the skins in a collection. Also when you kill with a weapon, even killing ambients count. There are cheap dyes on TP too. 
---
And joining guilds can be helpful. Most advertise in cities. 'G' will give you some info. They can be helpful, come kill with you, have guild hall with farming nodes and guild missions, and can be social with discord and guild chat. Some are laid back cuz some ppl dont wanna be all involved. All kinds out there. I am part of a guild 'alliance' of similar guilds banded together. They are out there too, be aware. 
---
And dont forget, if you get a title, use it! I personally like 'Chicken Chaser'. ( Achievement tab.) And if you get a Black Lion Key , usually from story, need a Black Lion Chest. Somewhat exclusive stuff there.

im not sure its working for most people. its reached a bit stale for alot of people. who are logging in more for sake of wanting to keep logging in then actually having real interest in anything. 
---
Expansions are huge selling points which i dont think Living story can be. sure its a nice feature but living story wont bring back players who have left an Expansion would.
---
Expansions also give them time to really add the big features and overhaul systems.
---
one of biggest issues with GW2 is its lost content that has become outdated especially early GW2 area's and the Dungeon's. if done right even starter area's could be good content but instead have been left behind with old systems.
---
its why Living Story 1 to me was great it moved around the world to area's that had nobody in and bought meaning to them.
---
World bosses are kinda dead as a whole as well. the Content of GW2 on paper is amazing there is so much to do but issue is 90% of the content is so outdated with the current GW2 systems its just not worth playing through unless your doing it for say story reasons.
---
Don't buy the waypoint unlock it's not worth  it
---
Honestly, i think it would be a lot better if instead of 6 new maps they made, say 2 big ones and had the whole season there. LS2 only gave us 2 tiny maps but silverwastes is so much more replayable than any new ones. Imagine if we got 2 big maps with the combined effort of 6 maps. It would limit the story somewhat, but I think that's a fair price for better gameplay experience. Overall i would much rather prefer expansions over living world. I would rather have massive Xpacs that shake up the game every 1.5 years with small updates inbetween, than logging in every 3 months for 2 days.
---
Great art, but why does the Warclaw have cat eyes? Last I checked they have glossy black eyes.
---
It is random, and you might get non-exclusive dyes.  Think of them like dye-only loot crates.
---
See I legitimately was like "lol skibbidy bee bop" when I named her so my brain wasn't in that place either lol
---
My guess is just give yourself time to get used to the flow.
---
Focus on one target at a time, use the dash button to move away from AoE and just kick their butts ^^
---
If you are on EU I could help you if you want, can go exploring and farm some Hero Points for you ^^ I could craft you some gear 
---
In gw2 you don't really have great natural durability no matter what class you play. You're mainly reliant on your skills or traits for any kind of self-sustain/durability. You can also build yourself more durably equipment-wise, but that's only worth doing at endgame (not for group content though).
---
There's no way to get the first zine anymore, right? I know it had been an early bird special on the new one but I missed it :(. The tarot set is great, I got "the world" and it is at the center of my GW2 swag collection. 
---
Sorry, it’s a retired book. I don’t have any extras left! I’m glad TT has such a nice space in your collection though!
---
unfortunately i'm not EU but thanks for taking the time to help me out with advice :) the community is awesome so far and i'm glad i can reach out to ask these kind of questions without being called a noob lol
---
for now ill definitely do as u say and practice with mobility and remembering buttons!
---
Yeah unfortunately I think that term for "scat" is a bit outdated.
---
Cool, like your positive attitude , if you have any question the community will help you.
---
I been playing for years and I’m still learning ^^
---
No, don't! It's a definite learning curve. I'd probably stick to maybe 2-3 mobs at a time. Anymore and it could overwhelm anyone. I don't think it's a gear issue since it is such a low level. 
---
Honestly, a set rotation isn't going to be very helpful to you at this point in time. That's more for longer fights, needing substained damage. Go burst all you can. Let it rip and try to down them quickly. When you're leveling and just getting the feel for things, you'll figure out what skills work well with others. Try things out and don't be afraid to even switch weapons! I'm a fan of double Axe on warrior, myself. You do have a duel wield feature. So, you could use greatsword and knock a few of those skills off and switch to another weapon set to finish them off!
---
That is the least of PvPs issues and hardly worth making a fuss about. 
---
Scrapper is clearly designed for large scale group support.  The bulwark gyro while giving a lot of barrier to just the scrapper is immediately eaten in an engage. Medic gyro needs to be strong to compete against medkit and heal turret. The way i see the new scrapper is practically the same gameplay but with gyros that aren't insta killed.  A spec that had the worst utilities in the game for 3 years now has their functionality improved to do what it should have been doing from release.  
---
I would so buy rooster raptor
---
Inflicts Fear, Confusion and Daze at random.
---
But were you doing any damage at all? 
---
My entire group is also making calls I just don't record their voices.  What we do works.
---
I've been doing this awhile.  I'm curious if all these people who write entire paragraphs of advice about how to call/command my guild are actively commanding for a guild themselves. 
---
Curious.  Do you actively command for a guild as of this moment? 
---
I fully agree with everything you're saying in this thread.  Keep in mind tho regarding cc that scrapper can double leap through 2 different lightning fields for aoe dazes 
---
Easiest comp? 9 sellers &amp; 1 buyer.
---
Jokes aside, would probably help if you brought a Scourge healer to recover from mistakes (dying to floor, standing in Qadim’s hitbox, not CC’ing fast enough and getting hit by mechanics etc.)
---
The rest really are issues where you might need to find better pugs or just practice more. “Forgetting to kill elementals” and “low dps” unfortunately isn’t a comp/class issue but more of a people getting familiar with mechanics issue. 
---
I hope this isn’t the reason/issue you face, but protect and retal pyres should be stripped ASAP before people actually waste their bursts on it.
---
Maybe bulwark gyro should give out pulsing barrier to those around so that it isn't as individually strong on a sole  scrapper
---
GW1 had great competitive "esport" pvp. Had spectator mode integrated in-game, (no twitch/youtube streamer needed crap) so i remember watching high ranked matches to learn how to play I would select player of same profession and look at his build how he plays it etc... Also GW1 felt lot more balanced and varied play, more build, counter-build variety, than just get meta build and crush everything.
---
or 1 million defiance bar damage
---
it's as they say, don't let seemingly complicated(but realistically easy) pve rotations give you a fake impression. Elementalist actually is really easy to play as, the problem is staying alive due their lousy health-pool, long-cd defenses, and easy to interrupt cast times. Usually you'd want to avoid damage instead of facerolling it, unlike necro/mesmer.
---
For a while I loved playing sw/d celes weaver, just for the nostalgia factor(pre, early HoT players would understand) But in open world probably scepter/warhorn marauder tempest works the best, I'd recommend mixing some gear with healing power (200ish\~) to burst heal yourself and your allies back to 100% hp within seconds it's a matter of tastes of course, but I'd strongly advice trying out some roaming WvW/sPvP builds in open world before committing to the class.  
---
Just try to avoid zerker gear and weapons like staff or sword while getting used to the class or you'll end up hating it.  
---
Despite what PoF has shown us so far. Elementalist is anet's favorite class, so it usually stays on really good (or top) spots on every gamemode (but open world) though sPvP hasn't been it's forte for a while...
---
must be gold or lower  if you ever expect dmg from scrapper 
---
Strange to hear that from a guy who returned to hearthstone after 2 years lul
---
Thank you, I hate it and I hate you thanks to it.
---
And krait chests
---
Absolutely beautiful. Just what I imagined them to look like!
---
The way GW2 was designed, decisions like: no pvp in the open world, last attack or greater damage do not steal loot or exp, all who collaborated receive rewards ... Things that disarm the trolls, you know? I see that made it a very friendly, hassles-free and super-collaborative game. In my view all this has generated a special and endless gear in the gaming community, is it like that old movie called Pay it Forward you know? xD Ty DEVS &lt;3
---
Almost all outfits are very dye-able actually
---
All questions were covered , so:
---
You can right click a salvage kit to salvage all items of a certain rarity at once instead of one at a time. You get a lot of drops in this game , you will be doing this ALL THE TIME.
---
You can click the little mouse wheel at the top of your bags and "deposit material". This puts all your crafting materials in your mat. storage bank tab without GOING to the bank. You will be doing this A LOT.
---
Gear is a lot different than most MMOs. Except for different stat combinations, gear of a certain "tier" ( like exotic , or ascended ) is all equal.
---
Join a good guild that welcomes new players. It will give you a pool of people to hang out with , help if u need help , do events, answer questions, and chat with. Unlike most games , you can join up to 5 guilds , which may help you find one you really like and want to mainly stick with.
---
The community is mainly great. You will run into some jerks ( mostly elitists , and mostly in non-open world modes: pvp , wvw , T4 fractals , raids ) . They aren't a majority , so don't let them bother. GW2 has a block function.
---
They are both problems in which they give burst health and sustained health on the same skill.
---
Also pulsing Protection from healing gyro toolbelt.
---
1. He suffered from perma-yawn condition. 
---
2. He foresaw a world of future. A world without him. But full of wicked, sparkles, furries and pink norn.
---
3. He remember he forgot to turn off the ovan.
---
4. He sees those Mirage benchmarks...
---
My first thoughts are that it could have been interpreted as a reference to either "cuckold" (which, while I don't know if it's vulgar per se, is used as an insult) or "cock".
---
I'm a 6 year vet, but my dad (fresh 80 ele) has just joined the game. He's having lots of trouble determining what's attacking him, or even *if* he's being attacked. 
---
All of his MMO experience until this has been 1-2 years of EQ (OG, pre-WoW) and then WoW for 14 years. I'm chalking up his inability to stay alive to simply him playing a new and living game instead of the **target -&gt; attack -&gt; damage** of the older ones. 
---
I've tried finding ways for him to see where damage is coming from better but I'm all out of ideas. I've tried analyzing my gameplay but it's too natural for me to really understand how to teach him. Can anyone help? His low survivability is the one thing keeping him from enjoying the game. 
---
Its not just insult. They are provoking suicide. It may not be death treat but still something that deserves ban or some action.
---
This. "Cuck" is very popular short for it 
---
I was going to say this actually. I haven't touched PvP in a long time and I'm probably wrong on some fronts but I feel they ought to be more consistent. For instance, they've done balance passes where they've reduced the initial healing on X skill but increased the scaling from healing power investment. They should really look at doing that across the board so that people have to make real choices about their builds and deal with drawbacks.
---
But at 7 years old, and given the recent layoffs, I wouldn't expect too much. Oh well.
---
When we are at that: HMS Divinitys reload animation is also still bugged.
---
Hey man, thanks!  
---
It's really tricky, isn't it? I'd looove to see this become a reality for nostalgics and new players alike, but I don't think that it's realistic or something we should expect nor a path ArenaNet should walk. Ultimatively this is a game for everyone and not just you and me; therefore I wouldn't mind if this is the basis or inspiration for something completely new. If I want nostalgia I can luckily still log on and hop to Haus Zu Helzer.  Just my personal opinion though.
---
How can a very new player make a bit of gold?  
---
I've been playing for less than 48h, my char is a lvl 12 ranger and I've been making a tiny bit of silver by selling gemstones and a few other crafting materials to players through the community store but it's slow and pays less than 2 silver per item. Is there any better way considering I'm new and dunno much about the game yet?
---
ps: I don't own any of the dlcs &amp; putting real money into the game (aka buy cash) is not a valid option or me.
---
Thanks all!
---
&gt;And name change contracts are only available for a digital currency called gems and not IRL funds, last time I checked.
---
And you buy those with ...? Come on dude, that's about the most useless sentence one could write
---
Cheapest one is already ~1.5g. How much cheaper do you want it?
---
? It gives loads of support via CC, condi removal, 18s stealth, damage mitigation....
---
And it's brain-dead easy to play.
---
Yeah, revenants can launch themselves backwards off of cliffs really efficiently
---
Why do you need some bit of gold 48h ingame? You should get everything you need by leveling up
---
At least for the sake of PvE, I believe you're absolutely right. I'd actually really like to go back and learn GW1 a bit again so maybe a fresh Factions run is in my near future.
---
On the other hand, for PvP, I'd flip to see even an independent, competative Factions 2 or something. Introducing new modes, maps, and nuances in builds that won't have PvE and WvW dragging on its heels for balance. Factions was already notorious for doing these things in GW1 and even having a PvP only version (for better or for worse but I loved the new professions and AB/CM for PvP). They could even confine it to the mists where all of our nostalgia dreams of a preserved Cantha come true. XD
---
This info is golden dude!

1. In GW2 there is no exclusive class to play the role of tank or healer, but yes, if you want, you can do a build in some class that will be more healer or tank, and of course, there are also classes that can be more tank or more healer than others, but that does not mean that it is strict for those classes. For example: warrior for having enough life and plenty of armor, he can be a tank, but he's not going to be just a tank, you're going to be a DPS with him too (it's as if all classes were made to fight / fight and be participate in combat fun and not only heal or tank while others sit around xD) but because the warrior class has the highest tier of life and tier of armor higher, so it will be more tank than an elementalist by example that has the lower tier of life and lower armor tier (or for example a guardian too, it has the highest armor tier and lowest life tier, though it has specs and traits that can give a lot of survival due the aegis gain), but that also does not mean that the elementalist can not have skills that give him enough survival. What I love the most is this, you can be what you want and still does not take away the common sense of the archetypes that for example: in the background the elementalist (which is the magician let's say so) is one of the most DPS in the game, but you can make it stand with auras and it's great too. But answering your question, if it is to play only in 2 I recommend a melee and a range, as follows: if you get 2 meeles, the 2 will stay in the distance of monster skills and will take a lot of beating, it can happen that 2 fall , and if you do not have one to revive and the two die, they will have to start again, and if you get 2 ranges, not that bad, but the 2 will be more distant from each other, and there if one falls, the other has to run further until he goes to him to revive before he dies. I recommend this: a melee and a range, I think it is the best composition, if you are new and are having difficulty, recommend classes with units, help because they catch the attention of monsters, a good example: A ranger and a necro. But do not limit yourself to this, all classes can be meeles or range, you can do a necro meele and a warrior range too xD
---
2. Complete maps, is great way to learn the mechanics of each class the best thing is to make the hearts and finish the maps, this will bring you experience in playing with your character, better understand how the skills work without that annoying thing to have to be reading everything, in practice it is much cooler xD Do the dungens too, I love it, they are very fun, each dungeon works in a different mode, has to do different things, always has a nice people too. Please [A.Net](https://A.Net) do a finder for the dungeons as PvP &lt;3 Try on fractals too, they are cool, they are shorter than the dungeons and each level you have to do something different, really cool. Raid has a more demanding people, I recommend you go with friends and PvP some people can sometimes be annoying if you do not know how things work right yet. But do it, the most worthwhile is to try and see how it is.. WvW I do not know much, I went once, but I thought it was cool too, it's complicated because it dies very easy kkkkkkkkkkkkkk (I like to run in front)
---
3. Yes you do! You can convert the game's gold into gems. There are several ways to make gold, in youtube you have many videos explaining, but in my opinion what I do is in fractals, making the dailies of fractals and recommendeds of fractals, if I do all should give about 25 gold per day . It's not much, but it's a fun way to do it, since I find the fractals pretty cool. There are other farms that give a lot more gold, but I find it grueling, for example running around in Silver Wastes repeating events, it gives a lot of money, but it gets tiring to spend many hours doing it.
---
I just browsed as well. Boy do I wish to make stuff like that! For now it's simple doodles with my pen on paper. Is there a specific program you use for this? I'll probably stick to trying this with my pen for now. But if you could share what your proces is for such an image (perhaps a seperate post?) that would be awesome!
---
I changed my dodge to pressing the middle mouse button and it helped a lot
---
so many questions. was she going commando or was there a brown brake track or, perhaps, something even more horrible
---
I wanna start lvling crafting asap since that's why I've started playing GW2 in the first place. According to my recent research I'll be needing \~35-40 gold to max the discipline I'm interested in so gotta get cracking.
---
Until now I've farmed less than .7 gold which is way too slow and I'm sure I can do better.
---
I'd still say they would need a nerf, (WvW Point of View) the sneak gyro is not a visible field to enemies like for example shadow refuge, which makes it amazingly hard to count on a mobile stealth field no one can see. And then the cooldown is a mere 45 seconds on such a long stealth (don't forget the trait where you can dodge and remove 3 sec cd on elites). The barrier you get from bulwark is alot, it's need some tweaking for solo play, in terms of support for you group, is amazing and can be dangerous to use in a zerg fast, but for solo play it is way too strong (Some mentioned to pulse some barrier to allies rather than solely to yourself).  
---
Overall, I think it's a good change to scrapper, it's fun and good. but it needs some tweaking (Call that a nerf if you will, but tweaking/change it needs) to barrier and stealth to make it a more fair spec.
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
To be honest, this is bullshit. Then I guess I cant have a name like "duck" because its almost "fuck" ?
---
I dont really care about the "cucc" name, it was jsut a storage character. What annoys me is the reasoning for the forced name change.
---
Like many skills of this type (and a lot of other effects for skins as well as the size of weaponry), the animation size is proportional to your character's size. If this is a max height charr, the animations can go beyond the range of their designated skill. Likewise, the smallest Asura using it would have a smaller spew, probably shorter than the actual range.
---
The issue with this thing is like jaw said
---
It’s brain dead
---
Even Gold player can stall high plat players 
---
Similar things like mirage soul beast, holo are killable by “ better player “
---
While the skill floor may be low the ceiling for sure isn't.
---
Watching chaith and jawgous play is like day and night.
---
Tab (or being a Scourge) makes you a target for me.   I couldn't care less what the character likes like or rides on. 
---
If you are patient, keep in mind that some of these dye packs exist as selectable versions (where you get to pick the dye you want, and not just get one of included ones at random) from your annual rewards.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Gift
---
Enemies dye pack + Glint's dye kit is https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celebratory_Dye_Pack -- given to 3 year old characters. 
---
Taimi's dye kit is https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jubilant_Dye_Pack  etc.
---
Awesome! Dailies would be daily challenges, right? Like what? I'm not sure if I'm familiar with those yet...  
---
Thanks again!
---
true but the time goes on. It shouldnt be frozen. While updating the game with legendary weapons or new legendary armors, they should update also those achievements. Or at least the description of those achievements. "You can do this achievement only with gen 1 legendary weapons" or "Only raid legendary armor counts for this achievement". 
---
Balance my friend is the issue.
---
Here's just an idea of why this game is subpar... You know what, 'Subpar' is me being too kind. It's literally shit when it comes to balance.
---
So GW2 wants to make everyone happy like an Developer right? Well you gotta throw some systems and teams less people so you can make money as a company. Sadly, the PvP Balancing Team gets the shaft on this one and they can only balance every 3-4 months compared to an actual PvP oriented game that gets a balance patch **Minimum** every 2 weeks in most cases.
---
They had opportunities, they had the ESL and long story short, they dropped the ball in every conceivable way.
---
I still love Arenanet, but it's really depressing.
---
Yeah the outrider one looks derpy. The face looks disproportionate to the rest of the body and has this grin that somehow manages to pull off CREEPY and DERPY at the same time. I like the branded and fire one though.
---
Okay, so then the power mirage builds on the different gw2 build sites are still viable end game damage builds?
---
From your first comment it seems like you're a f2p player, so I'm pretty sure that selling/buying on the Trading Post is mostly limited to raw materials. Luckily, the current go-to farm for gold is Silverwastes, check out [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/awbxw8/2019_new_silverwastes_farming_guide/). It's a level 80 zone from the core game and the end results are ~T4 materials that sell pretty nicely on the TP. You have to have another [character at level ~50](https://silverwastes.loltools.net/) to open bags and salvage gear to make good profit.
---
Also, the daily achievement refers to [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Daily). The wiki is your friend.
---
You have a bunch of Daily achievements you can do in PvE, PvP and WvW that gives you minor rewards but if you do 3 of those (can be 3 PvE, 1 PvE + 1 PvP + 1WvW, etc) you get 10 Achievement Points and 2 Gold.
---
See the [wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Daily) for a more detailed explanation.
---
In PvE Power Mirage was never "viable" in endgame. Mirage is a consi spec. If you want to go power you need Chrono
---
They look fantastic :D Seeing Warclaws patterned into every other big cat would also be fantastic, even if it overlaps with griffons a bit
---
I love it precisely because of that "taxidermy gone wrong" look. It's so darling
---
GPU is meant to work in full usage during gameplay, check any game performance test on youtube. It wont use full potentian when You play in minimal settings or gpu ia bottlenecked by cpu, then whats the point of good gpu if You can't use it correctly?
---
most things are viable in pve (meaning they are able to complete the content, though some will have a herder time doing it than others)
---
mirage is mainly a condi spec, most of its traits are geared towards the condi playstyle or are defensive traits more swited for survival. it doesnt provide much benefit to power damage. so power mirage won't give you "top tier damage"
---
if you want top tier damage and still play mirage then condi is your go to build. if you prefer doing power damage then chrono will give you much better damage options than mirage
---
40s sounds appropriate. Given how many tines we need to change gear.
---
The stripping is easily done by assigning one chrono to retal and one chrono to protection pyre. Those chronos can then strip the pyre and then go back to main arena and focus pull one of the golemns instantly, don't need to wait them to get to Qadim. Druid or a scourge healer can pull/stop the remaining golemn.
---
One chrono could take a portal aswell, even if only for the JP phase, that makes the JP a lot easier for pugs.
---
The main problems I see with pugs is the inability to dodge the big slam attack Qadim does, even tho it is telegraphed looong before the actual hit even comes. And another one is that they go stand in Qadims hitbox during the burn phases and down due to the burning AoE.
---
Something to keep in mind when assembling a Qadim group is that you don't want to assign 2 players to kiting and 2 players to Lamp. Either you want a Solo kite or solo lamp. I prefer to have a solo kiter and duo lamp, this way you have one more player uptop to help with the Legendaries and CC's. Most often the DPS up top is good enough that when the Lamp is opened the legendary is already at 80% or close to that.
---
Small Indie company
---
If you want it go to Rhytlock and ask him if you can borrow it. Let's see what he will tell you about xD.
---
&gt; And you buy those with ...? Come on dude, that's about the most useless sentence one could write
---
with gold i earned in game, another digital currency. i also got 2k gems from achievement point reward chests.
---
That's an issue with PvP itself, though. In WvW you'll seldom find yourself alone with your enemy, and merely prolonging a fight won't help you achieve anything. Also, that same bulwark ends up harming the scrapper in zerg fights, as he gets damage from allies he has no control upon even when the barrier is depleted.
---
But in PvP all you need to do is stay alive on a point you've conquered before. You don't even need to kill people, even CC them out is fine enough. Killing is basically optional.
---
It's the mode itself that's brain-dead.
---
This is why once something like this becomes known Anet needs to make a statement and take a stance against it. They're so damn afraid to take a stand even if its a clear exploit and ruining a game mode.
---
That is the beauty of this art, it can be interpreted in many different ways all according to the fantasies of the reader.
---
&gt;That is the beauty of this art, it can be interpreted in many different ways all according to the childhood trauma's of the reader.
---
FTFY
---
But this is how they make more money from you
---
There are things wich can help you with it. 
---
Reflexions. Wich you need to have yourself or play more tanky builds. Also bad connection will work against you. 
---
Build. Most Wars runs Zerks (Power, Precision and Ferocity) 
---
Knowledge of your enemy. After you will learn your enemy then you will know what attacks you should dodge and wich are harmless. Wich you can take in your face and wich you cant . Knowing your enemy is half of the battle done. 
---
Equpment. Because you are constantly leveling up you should have also better gear. Buying new one every level isnt the best idea but sometimes when you are in a corner like you said yourself, updating your equipment helps a lot. 
---
Range weapons. Even tho its not a meta thing, you always should have a range weapon in your inventor. Rifle for zerks and longbow for condi builds. Been able to kite is another way how to deal with the enemy. 
---
Know when to CC. Cc are stuns and disables wich you can use to give you some time to react and kill your enemy. Every class does have some stuns wich they can use. Be carful because normal mobs takes one CC to get disabled for some time but legendary champions does have a break bar. Those needs to be cced a lot to become dissabled for a while. Also be carful because some CC skills like kick of your warrior does have knock back. Kick them back into their friends and you will have all of them on you. Be smart about it ;) 
---
for power chrono what weapons should i go for?
---
I just fill a thermos with alfredo and take it with me to work.
---
*toots with intellectual superiority*
---
Experienced this while doing some very small scale roaming with my partner. We could hold ourselves against groups of 2 to 4 players until a French chronomancer exploiting this bug would occasionally turn up and exploit away. Left a pretty sour taste given how the fights were going otherwise. 
---
Man i really miss the magic that was GW1. Sure, GW2 is great, but GW1 was so special.....
---
Is he clicking his skills with the mouse?
---
If you're not using it to look around and move gw2 is much harder.
---
You have more active combat in gw2 compared to wow and spinning with [A] / [D] is not recommended.
---
Keybind your skills, Ele is fine if you use [F1] - [F4] for Attunements, don't have your utilities on 5-10 because you cant reach there.
---
Use mousekeys if you have some and your usual [Alt]+ modifier combo.
---
If coming from WoW that should be easy tho.
---
Ele is one of the squishiest classes but scales well into lategame, maybe try Mesmer or Guardian, they're equipped fast at max lvl and have a way better toolkit to survive open world.
---
Report&gt;Verbal abuse. 
---
You won't hear anything more about it, but I know people who've been temporarily banned for raging too hard in raid groups. Anet staff will make the decision based on their own guidelines how to deal with it. 
---
I used to be a teacher (of mostly adults, not kiddlywinks) I bring a "would I tolerate this in my classroom?" attitude to reporting stuff:
---
* Someone raging because they didn't get what they want? Whatever. Sometimes people rage. In group stuff, sometimes I'll add an agreeing-but-actually-helpful comment. "Okay we need 3 people on X because they're counting on picking us off one by one" is more helpful that "omfg learn to play".
---
* Someone with specifically-targetted abuse? Report. Slurs? Report. Disproportionate or overlong raging? Report. 
---
However, the competitive game modes tend to bring out the worst in people. Most of the time it's more chilled out. 
---
i feel you. i'd love to lock class cuz since it's there, people would just switch to counter enemies. the game mode has been neglected for far too long. now that wvw gets some attention and add new contents, plus rewards, i hope spvp would be looked into and revived at some point. 
---
How often you can get Black Lion Key from lvl 10 story? Can you do it daily or is it weekly thing? If its weekly, when is the reset? Thanks!
---
I run sw/sw and Gs
---
I did this achievement with rifle deadeye (I think any ranged weapon will work). Before fight I jumped on those ice pillars near wall and just pew-pewed boss from there. Its attacks didn't reach me as I was on different height.
---
Next one is Elonian Musk?
---
The best one yet. :'DD You literally made me scream, cry and laugh irl, you.
---
Better to have "This is the End" or "Hello Darkness my old Friend" 
---
https://imgur.com/qvzOega
---
10k kills? H-how.. :'D
---
Can you screenshot your gfx settings?
---
How do druids pull or stop the remaining golems? I know heal scourge has spectral grasp and fear shades. What does druid have?
---
Comparing them is not that meaning less. Yes, utilities are balanced a bit differently between classes, but I have never seen such a huge difference in effectiveness before. Typically you get much smaller differences in power like when you compare mesmer's blink to ele's lightning flash. Bulwark gyro is on a completely different level to its competition.
---
The weapon skill comparison is somewhat valid but not entirely. All of the ele's skills are designed to be weaker individually than on other classes and you can only focus on a limited amount of attunements with your specializations. If the extra skills on ele where so impressive, the class would never struggle in PvP. As for scrapper, the tool belt skills should also be taken into account.
---
Immob from staff 4 or CA5 is what I have used. You just need to immob then long enough for the slubs to walk out the circle
---
As has been said, it's random.  But if there's a dye you want, now is a good time to check prices on the TP.  Many of the ones available via the sale will be around 10g.
---
Well, maybe it was a dishonest smith.
---
I think i come fast xd 
---
#*NEVER EVER*
---
He's in both games
---
It changed with PoF. It was a regular FDS through all of HoT
---
Actually its scourges that get sand shades, not revenants
---
Nice atmosphere! I love the misty/rain outside and the warm light inside the building, transition from dim to the brightest to center of the bazaar, its so spectacular and moody at the same time!
---
Non-pvp and dolyak sniping is wonderful for you? Maybe the wvw you're looking for is the silverwastes.. 
---
anyway i cant understand how having less fights can be good for a pvp mode.
---
&gt;Besides BLC and mount licenses
---
I mentioned the loot boxes. I was saying that it's at least limited to the mount licenses (which at least now have an option to choose a specific skin) and Black Lion Chests/Keys (which can also be gained from map completions, PvP reward tracks, and story steps, and many of the possible drops are TP-able). Is Anet perfect? No, but for now their cash shop and microtransaction model are miles better than most others in the industry. That doesn't mean we should give them a pass when they do stupid things like this, but it could be worse. At least they're not Bungivision with Destiny 2 (at least the base game, I haven't played since before Forsaken), with almost all cosmetic rewards put in the cash shop, which is constantly shoved into your face, and only allows you to buy things directly through a currency you can only get through salvaging other loot box rewards...oh, and their dyes are only single use. Even though every mount and glider skin is locked inside the gem store, at least we can get the majority of other cosmetics (weapon/armor skins, guild hall decorations, auras, dyes, legendaries, etc.) through gameplay, buy most things directly, convert in-game currency to premium and vice versa, and we can change our dyes as much as we want for free (seriously, WTF, ActiBungie?).
---
Well to bring her back to life is just my little wish but thats probably from all of us. And if you will think about it more Sohothin could bring her back based on the connection of those magics. Balthazar's sword , Sohothin and Aurene has the same magic inside them. We have reignited Balthazar's sword with Sohothin and Balthazar himself reignited Sohothin while Rytlock was in the Mists. It wouldnt be so crazy if Sohothin could bring her back to life. Not the same because her brain would be dead for some time so she could be more .. dangerous. She wouldnt have any memory just basic animal instincts. Trying to kill us or flying away scared maybe. 
---
Quote of the day: "doesn't mean it's OP, just that it's incredibly good"

I played a shitton and tagged stuff with scourge.  Easy way to pad stats!
---
That metric doesn't work, because The Kaiser is still under timegate unless you drop a significant amount of gold into the TP to buy the weapons. Completing both worlds normally would be better suited to get proper numbers.
---
Also, its ArenaNets decision to have it only last a short amount per year. It should have been a permanently availiable Activity in rotation just like Keg Brawl, Southsun Survival and the like.
---
Either way, Josh Foreman managed to build most of W1 on his own in his spare time in less than half a year (W1 debut was April 1st 2013). Why ArenaNet thought that W2 needed so much more intricacy is beyond me; so much more that they need an entire LW dev team to pour half a year into it, and thats whats kept W3 and W4 from us the past 5 years. ArenaNet went full blown map design where so much work simply isn't necessary. It looks gorgeous, no questions asked, but it would work with much less as well.
---
Oh that's a shame :(
---
I saw some.ething a week or so ago on your Twitter. Was that it?
---
You can also check out snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/
---
They have a detailed rotation text for pve purpose :)
---
I cant seem to decide between ranger or thief?
---
Who to pick and why got 1 slot left
---
They can run back but once you have slowed them enough that the slubs are vulnerable the slubs can't become protected again and the golem is now independent: it will try to attack/follow players and not only walk toward Qadim.
---
You can also use Iboga F2 if the Iboga is placed correctly or if you wanna be extra safe you can take a Glyph of Tides.
---
But first they should make items that are the same, but come from different sources stackable. Looking at 3 different stacks of lvl20 scrolls in my bank.
---
Scar?
---
Hmm technicaly we came back from death without any gods. There was only The Judge. Yes you are right that Sohothin might not be enough to bring her back, but she also ate Joko. Maybe there could be both sides playing role to resirect her. Half of the magic from Sohothin so she would be reignated and half of the magic been an Awaken. We as commander are not a empty husk. At least I hope. Maybe she will end up as Forged/Awaken/Mordrem/Undead dragon ? It doesnt mater.. I still want to give her a funeral =( 
---
Wow this guy seems like an incredibly whiny little cunt. 
---
How much did you get paid for saying it?
---
I want Cantha so bad. I started playing GW1 when Factions came out. I'm so nostalgic for it.
---
Same thing happened to a few people and me last night when trying to take a camp for dailies (funnily the same one as in the video). Two Drakkar bois stealthed and wiped everyone after the cap circle appeared. It was hilarious when three of us got back and they unsurprisingly tried to do the same stunt again, but we managed to kill them. One even tried to get away while being downed. Best I could do was a screenshot after they had wiped us though.
---
I sent a detailed report to exploits@arena.net - and in case you haven't sent them your video yet, you probably should do that too.
---
I don't think you're quite meeting the standarts of gw2's friendly community. I'm going for my pitchfork and downvote arrows!
---
Anyway, this isn't the state of gw2, this is the state of online gaming in general. Engaging MMOs that require ingame investment are pretty much done at this point. Embrace degeneracy. 
---
“You’re paying for the journey.” One thing ANET has never understood. When you make things time consuming you elongate the game. When I say time consuming I don’t mean lock behind a time gate. I mean skill and most importantly, travel time. If it take time to get to point A from point B, then the game gets a appearance of longer more time investment. All of a sudden things feel more meaningful (dying actually matters.) 
---
I would love they day when ANET makes these massive maps with one way point. Or a hard mode version where you can’t way point. If you want a game that feels like a journey. That’s how you start.
---
I do recognize the causal will be like “no that’s not the problem blah blah blah” but seriously, I challenge you to play Morrowind or Fallout 4 on Survival and all of a sudden everything you do feels like a calculated decision. 
---
Yeah. It's really not that difficult to figure out. Or apparently it is for ArenaNet.
---
I sent it thru the /bug ingame as well as that email too.
---
&gt; Hmm technicaly we came back from death without any gods. There was only The Judge.
---
True but not because of a sword but because we helped the underworld and reclaimed our name and purpose.
---
Consuming Joko could also be used as an explanation for her absorbing his power to be immortal but IMO this would be a bit too much for for the interaction of those characters. That would mean whatever aurene consumes could make her gain those properties.
---
It would only be impractical if you only want to change twice. Ever. In that case you may as well only have two sets of gear. Unlocking stats and upgrades would only be practical for people who regularly switch between sets of gear, and it would only work in the way I intend if a build template system was also added at the same time, as having to manually change the gear would be too much of a hassle.  
---
In your example, with berserker and viper gear, you'd only need to 3 sets of gear: The one you consume to prove you've obtained berserker gear, the one you consume to unlock viper, and the one that will switch between the two.  The gear (or at least the stats in it) has to be consumed in the process, otherwise people would just use the mystic forge recipe to get different stats and get them all much cheapily and without having to play much of the content that provides those stats. 
---
'Consuming' the stats in the gear could be just using them in a process that turns the Ascended gear into a new kind called something like "Mystic gear" that has the same power as ascended but can't be used to unlock stats. 
---
The important point should be "not having the cake and eat it too", so people keep seeking new gear, instead working only on their current set.  
---
Once berserker and viper stats have been unlocked, your third set would be able to switch between the two stats with a small cost, but it would give up its own stats in the process. So if the third set was Magi, once it's switched to viper or berserker, it would no longer be usable to unlock magi, so it'd be wiser to use gear with stats you've already unlocked as the gear that would swap, so players would not be discouraged from replaying content just because they already got those stats, since the gear would stil lbe usable to switch their stats.  
---
The cost would have to be high enough so the system isn't trivial and legendary remains desirable, but reasonable enough so the system is servizable, while legendary gear would also be able to use the template system in the same way, but without requiring to unlock anything and without paying any cost.  
---
And with a game with so much varied content, it's impossible to keep all content relevant even if you have unique rewards meant to be acquired repeatedly like gear. Because you can't guarantee that those rewards will stay meaningful. One day Seraph gear may become part of the meta because a change in some skills, another day it becomes useless again.  
---
And you can't make rewards too unspecific and very repeatable, because then people flock to the spot that gives the most reward in the least time and other locations become depopulated, like they did with SW, Tarir and Istan.  
---
The solution for that is greater rewards in greater spans of time spread in more of the content. Daily rewards in meta-events are given within too small of a time frame so people will prefer to do daily the ones that give the best rewards and disregard the rest.  
---
If they reintroduced monthly achievements, but this time making them quarterly and giving considerable bonus rewars for each individual task, then people would likely spread more and do more varied things. Kind of like a 'season' of rewards.  Different raid bosses, different dungeon paths, different world bosses and metas. Complete full sets, like every fractal level or every Tyrian world boss, and you'll get extra quarterly rewards. 
---
There could also be alternate items that can be used to pay for switching, obtainable in different parts of the content. Take the bloodstone trinket vendore in Bloodstone Fen. The bloodstone capacitor she sells could be changed to give the currency to swap stats when used, or a second bloodstone item added to the vendor under it. You'd use the capacitor to swap the stats in bloodstone gear just like always, or buy the next item in the list every now and them, consume it, and get currency to swap stats in your gear with templates.  
---
Long story short, taking S3 trinkets as an example:
---
* As the game currently is, you go to the S3 maps every time you want a set of 5 trinkets and back. If you want different stats for the same character or the same characters for another character, you have to get the full set again, and the more different stats you get the more cluttered your bags and bank become.  
---
* With the idea I'm trying to explain, you'd go to the S3 maps to get a set of trinkets and back every time you want to gear a new character, and every time you want a new stat you haven't unlockedm, and to get currency to swap (by getting the trinkets and salvaging them, or by buying packages of the currency directly from the different S3 vendors, or by some other method), but not if you want to equip a stat you already got on a character that already has a set of trinkets, when you are already stocked with the currency to swap. 
---
So this would not really remove the need to get more gear. It would mostly remove part of the hassles of managing gear you have already acquired. 
---
Thrown in the ever growing pile of abandoned ideas.
---
Or they can call it “after layoffs”. 
---
&gt;the private metrics support this type of release or they wouldn’t do it.
---
You say that as if companies never fuck up or chase short-term gain at the expense of the long-term. My point is, I've no doubt they've based their decisions on data, but companies also fuck up or make bad decisions all the time.
---
New player here.
---
I just reached level 80 and i find some dungeons a bit too hard, i guess becase my gear is bad atm. Also i want to do HoT content and im guessing i will be overwhelmed. 
---
 I play condi trapper ranger with axe/torch and shortbow. I just have yellow gear and 2 orange pieces maxing condi and power as much as i could, and only 2 superior runes on my gear yet.
---
My question is: should i get first a decent exotic set or should i go directly to craft ascended? I know what set i have to get in ascended but for exotic i couldnt find any recommendations. 
---
Thanks, 
---
Followed one dude last week while trying to get Warclaw and he just kept picking fights with bigger zergs, or running in circles. Ended up joining another Zerg where the commander was actually going after keeps, towers and camps.
---
Most of the time though if there is no commander on the map I’ll just after camps and supply routes with a small group of players, sometimes towers.
---
You semi afked for rewards on the busiest map during the busiest week, griefing your team for your personal gain.
---
Don't you think your behavior is antisocial and toxic? Would you be surprised to learn you're harming others actively?
---
Our sentiments exactly. It’s more than a full job for me, so tackling these without any monetary return is more than scary - it’s just hard to sustain. If our company collapses or has a red year, we wouldn’t be able to do anything in the future. 
---
And probably. Once we iron out if it’s 100% doable within our budget, we’ll do a formal announcement.
---
This is truly amazing!
---
Seems it’s not yet available in my country, but thanks, I’ll keep an eye on it.
---
&gt; That would mean whatever aurene consumes could make her gain those properties.
---
That idea is terrifying. She would have hunger and ate a sheep. Then she would grow a wool ? No I mean the magic in that food. Joko had the magic to "reanimate" himself while taking life force from others. 
---
Pff I hate you. Now I want wooly Aurene mini following me xD
---
Revs and weavers cant kill much if it has proper support and boons either.
---
The game is around organised spikes where you lose boons for a small period of time, in which revs scourges and weavers kill you.
---
Power creep only makes the distinction between being in a bomb and instantly dead or having full hp and all boons worse, not better. 
---
are you on EU? if you want I can show you around and stuff .. 
---
Treknor.3018 @OP
---
Sounds like a mustard flavor.
---
If someone did 'test' this and said yep all good here! ...
---
This should obviously be fixed, but you literally cant get rid of the bug easily once it happens... relogs to queued maps just halt your raid for hours.
---
Abuse is bad, but half the players playing with it in the last week simply didnt want to relog for good reasons. 
---
Also nice gameplay =)
---
I'm sure you were doing this only last week while outnumbered yet your team managed to cap sm despite obvious outnumber. Having eb outnumbered for a long period of time is pretty damn rare too... really makes me wonder. 
---
Even then you add nothing, not helping those actually outnumbered while inflating population measurements. But obviously less bad than full maps. 
---
\*eyes up 6-8 stacks of fallen adventurer backpacks*

I got lucky my week off in uni was on the same week as the warclaw patch I played very unhealthy amounts of hours...
---
Beautiful! I just reinstalled GW1, and I was literally just in Wajjun Bazaar trying to get some Jade Bracelets on a new character for the 20/20 domination off-hand from a collector, lol!
---
You captured the colors and atmosphere so perfectly.
---
I follower whoever as long as my participation keeps going :P
---
&gt; Joko had the magic to "reanimate" himself while taking life force from others.
---
Yes, that is what I meant. The properties not in physical but magical form.
---
Could work but Aurene would get too much of an Deus Ex Machina plot device with "here eat this and that and now you can [saaaavveeee the world](https://youtu.be/RcBm78rpbnI?t=13)"
---
&gt; Pff I hate you. Now I want wooly Aurene mini following me xD
---
The scene would be hilarious. Aurene eats the sheep and chomps it down. [Whomp ...

---
Thank you. Thank you, thank you, *thank you*. 3:00 and onwards (the part about players wanting everything for nothing and their argument being " i paid so i am entitled") fits *so devastatingly good* into the mindset of a large portion of one of my guilds, its not even funny anymore.
---
I am still snickering about this uncanny resemblence in a video thats about a completely different game.
---
Thank you.
---
She can destroy some cover with a few shots as fas as i am aware but she has an obvious indicator when you broke line of sight
---
Well there are newbie friendly classes wich perform exceedingly well in endgame...
---
I'm maining Dragonhunter for example, its absolute faceroll and deals 30k dps while pressing 4 buttons. Also its extremely tanky for Aegis and Stabi is part of the core rotation.
---
To be honest there are 3 classes allways played in endgame, those being bannerslave / chrono / druid. Nowadays anet trys to get quickbrand, alacricitygade and scourge into support roles as well, thats great but there will allways be classes that are welcome in group content and others that who need to proove themselfes.
---
 
---
Play a class thats welcome, you'll get tired of defending your classchoice all the time.
---
Wrong group?
---
some/most bosses get a blue bar under their health bar, as you should have noticed. this is the CC bar, depending on the tactics used/boss this needs so be "broken" asap or staled as long as possible (it mostly is the ASAP thing) this bar you break with you "CC abilities"..overwiew of what IS cc and HOW MUCH cc bar damage certain skills you find here https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defiance_bar  and here https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Control_effect
---
dps is just focusing doing damage. (which you should do anyway...)
---
can be also used as "ignore all mechanics from now on and just focus the boss."
---
and no worries, in open world there are masses of player not knowing what they are doing. with asking you are already a few steps ahead.
---
you need to run from cover to cover and use the pillars to break line of sight. it'll reset the cast time for her next shot. wooden structures will block one shot before breaking so be careful with those
---
Reaper doesn't exactly have a lot of mobility though, my problem is I'm dead before I can even reach cover.
---
The upvote ratio of this post speaks for itself (40% at the moment). I like the top comment of the video too: 
---
&gt;1.6k downvotes? is it because you guys didnt get a mount after watching this video?﻿
---
&gt; really makes me wonder.
---
I was equally surprised. 
---
Outnumbered. The second I destroyed the wall I see a commander tag popping up in the mini map. Big squad takes SMC. Big squad leaves EB. Outnumbered. Enemy takes SMC. Repeat.
---
50 ranks here. But since this is from ~360 to ~410, this is quite some improvement.
---
I don't care about the number of killed players, that's a mere side effect. If I can take an objective without any player kill I am just as happy as with, maybe even happier.
---
you should be able to just run for it. would you mind recording a short vid or something
---
I'm also pretty casual I'd say and going with a quite similar build. In tarir you should just know when to stop dps but it's pretty hard to fuck these up by mistake I'd say
---
There are two things, usually, that you do in an event/meta: DPS and CC.
---
DPS phase = find the target of the event/meta, get in range of your skills and do the rotation from that build site you linked.
---
CC phase = if cc is required (depends from meta to meta), use the cc skills that are written on that build site.
---
Carefully go through all of your traits, weapon skills, utilities and read what they do. 
---
If you need healing, use heal skill or barrier from your F skills, if you know there's an attack that does will cc you (knockback, knockdown, stun, daze etc.) you can either dodge or use your trail of anguish utility skill for stability, if there are lots of mobs use epidemic on the target with most conditions (usually champions/legendaries) to cleave them fast.
---
Obligatory mesmer is Anet's child comment.
---
Pretty sure that renegade was nerfed because they dont want hybrid renegade to dominate the meta (like dps chrono with perma boons did...), but since it's nowhere close to that I dont see why it was needed right now.
---
Keybind the hotkey for the warclaw and press it two times. 
---
Even with how poorly it performed, Pro League still more than paid for itself by their own metrics. The reason it ended was Grouch going to Amazon.
---
I saw that too. Perfect comment.
---
It depends on the build tho.  You can trait for stab on evade and stab on disabled foe/function gyro which actually happens quite a lot if they choose those traits
---
Fair enough.
---
You are correct, these changes were focused at WvW. Unfortunate they had consequences in PvP but come on just don’t fight the scrapper lol it’s weaver v2
---
It’s getting adjusted and then we can all move on with our lives whilst I cry for my dead demo tools scrapper
---
It shows as Spirit_woods, so... technically you completed the event and for this week you won't get reward no matter how much times you repeat it. It just had to give you reward the first time :\
---
I assume this is NA gvgs where weavers exist ? 
---
The Confusion condition needs to be changed to consume all of its stacks when triggered. Right now, mirage is dominating those bosses - SH, Largos, and to a lesser extent Matthias - because of two factors: mobility, and fast attacks.
---
While Matthias doesn't attack very fast, he does move a lot, and mirages don't rely on ground fields to do their damage - unlike most other DPS classes. Plus mirages can bring feedback, so they're useful. Largos and Soulless Horror both attack quickly and often, as well as moving around a ton, so confusion procs a lot.
---
If confusion got leveled out to just deal all its damage in one chunk and then vanish, mirage would be more useable in other content, as well as being less oppressively present on the bosses I just mentioned.
---
Start new characters (preferably same race) and do the story together. Try to find synergys between your classes like necro and ele. The necro pulls 5 enemies from big range together and the ele blasts them away in no time.
---
GW2 has many examples as well, for instance the reduction of the elite spec cost from 400 to 250, the removal of WvW from World Exploration, the "adjustments" to difficult meta events like Chak and remade Tequatl. While GW2 is less affected in this regard than many other games, the effect of gaming becoming more and more of a mass market and thus increasing the need for accessibility is much more visible over a timespan, not within most single games (WoW being a notable outlier because its going on for so long now). Just look at the mobile market. The most successful games are those that basicly play themselves and / or don't require any time or skill investment whatsoever (but cash instead).
---
The problem with variable difficulties is that the lower skilled players want the rewards of the higher skilled tier but don't want to get better beforehand. I'm all for a "story-mode" version of the raids for those who don't want to pour time and effort into raiding but do want to experience the story. But then the "i paid for it so i demand in" crowd will rise up even more.
---
not a problem, nothing to worry about :)
---
Well, it depends on how the story will play out, really.  
---
"Holy Shit It's Actually F#@!ing Over Guys" could very well be a more fitting name. : \^)
---
That's the kind of p2w I like.
---
Whisper only with mutual friends.
---
And here I am, average at best, just trying to grind legendary armor and not let all of this get to me. I love this game, but I fear it'll be dead before I complete my legendary stuff.
---
What about Team chat?
---
Dodging is a dps increase. If you can think of any better mechanic than this for largos please let us know.
---
Those are some pretty harsh elements! I think if it's in a floodplain or if it's a tornado risk, he really should disclose that. 
---
If you will look into the enemy zerg ahead of us, you will see them somewhat glitching, like they have their mount/dismount animation continually going on—this is what we call as warclaw exploit. If in that state, they can never be CC’d—fear, slow, cripple, among others—and they can still attack back using their weapon skills and utilities.
---
&gt; and to a lesser extent Matthias - because of two factors: mobility, and fast boss attacks.
---
Make it 3: Feedback and your chrono doesn't have to waste a utility.
---
Yeah, for me, coming from korean mmos, gearing and crafting are the things that more confuse me. Tho i think the system is very interesting. 
---
Just consume all you want. The only thing that matters is that you complete the collection (and dont delete your spearmatshal thing since its really useful for tping). The rest you dont need for anything since you just need to interract with some stuff in the end.
---
When you get to kormirs library you get keys you need to use to unlock chests and thats p much all the items you will get
---
A lot of times in combat, ranged mobs will take you out while you're fighting melee mobs. People who are saying dodge are right but you still only have so many dodges.
---
One strategy is to use landscape to break line of sight, so all the foes have to come into you. Then you're killing ranged and melee guys at the same time, instead of fighting the melee guys while the ranged mobs kill you.
---
This strategy is often used in end game content to position foes where you want, to kill the quickly with aoe or cleave attacks.
---
"The Cow Whisperer" 
---
I would welcome any other. Even if it wasn't stacking Mirages and you still had one or two here and there. 
---
How does it work? Is the sneak gyro not a mobile smoke field?
---
Why isn't there more guild oriented stuff in a game called Guild wars :'(
---
"Yo dawg, ya lookin' good. Betta watcha y'ass outte cuz its not safe for uz mooin with those happies bitchin' around ya?"

Yes. You place it and then activate the command skill to teleport.
---
If you have a static, try participating in SC's shenanigan's comp competition. 
---
With regards to solo-instanced story content, I actually think some fights still need nerfing. Finishing the story chapters on normal difficulty (since there are no different difficulty levels available) should not be some great accomplishment
---
I always found it quite strange how relatively difficult some of the fights are, considering that the story content is supposedly geared towards more casual players.  
---
That is not arguing against challenging content, just arguing about where the challenges are located. I would however very much welcome some of the LW story instances being additionally available as 5-man mini dungeons.
---
GW2 does not use DX12 and is not bottlenecked by the rendering anyway.
---
They should allow scribes to craft guild accessories that guild members can use on mounts
---
Same as any other level 80 gear: salvage everything except rares that cost more than ecto on TP and exotics that are around or over 1g. If you always do Tarir on a certain character and hace the bag space for it, you could save the bags and open the ones unaffected by MF with a bag opener and the others after a SW run. Again, only if you have the bag capacity for it and you always do it on one character. It's not really that huge of a difference.
---
what about this?

I lead pugs with a friend. I joined 2 statics and tried to lead 2 by myself and it was horrible everytime with people playing way beloew what they claimed to be (you just don't get teleported every single time at vg when you pinged over a hundred dhuum kp), people not appearing or responding, and much more nonsense.

No I just want to be able to craft those weapons again as well as legendary back items. You are able to craft most of those lege weapons many times as well as armors can be crafted more then once. Just these 4 weapons and Ad Infinit cant be crafted more then once. They should change it

The problem imo is not story being difficult, it's open world being way to easy, especially core game. Auto attack defeats everything.

Pretty sure OP is referring to PvE Scrapper and its support potential over Revenant, Druid and the like...but I'm seeing PvP oriented rant all over the place. /shrug
---
I am confused as to why this one got marked nsfw.  Is everything by pp defaulted to nsfw now? :x
---
Mostly, as long as they support win xp they will 100% stick with dx9. And that dx12 would not yield the improvements we want.

---
I appreciate all of the constructive conversations going on, and that (most everyone) is talking civilly about it. From what I’m hearing though it still seems strange because people seem to be ignoring when I say that scrapper has no boons to offer itself and it has low damage output. All the books that come to scrapper are from condi conversion. Trying to get your own boons without purity of purpose is near impossible. 
---
People are saying nerf its tankiness but you realize that any nerf to scrappers tankiness will result in holo becoming better for bunker? Scrapper is a strong bunker yes, and sure lower skilled players can stand their own against higher skilled ones, but that’s because scrapper in itself is DESIGNED from the beginning to be a tank. They nerfed it’s hammer damage way back because it was too strong, but power creep and neglect allowed holo to outperform scrapper in nearly everything. 
---
People are acting like it has amazing burst and damage when in reality it’s all for utility. What’s it’s counter? Herald does an amazing job at staying on the scrapper and hitting it through unblockables, a good herald can usually outperform a good scrapper. CC works amazingly against a scrapper, as nearly all of them only have 1 source of stab on a 30 second cooldown that has to be used predictively and 1 stun break from elixir gun. 
---
It’s been literally a week since it’s been changed, I’m just saying that people got WAY too used to fighting holos as the main engi bunker spec. Give it time and people will find counters to scrapper. Hell I was dueling my friend with my scrapper against his reaper and the fights skewed from me winning all the time to him winning because he got smart with placing his boon conversions and timed most of his bursts after I used my cleanses. Just give it time, we’re still much too early in this to be yelling out OP rather than looking at the whole picture.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defiance_bar#Behavior
---
Many bosses take extra damage for a few seconds after their CC bar is broken.  Often a squad leader will call out "DPS now" at this point.  During this window of opportunity you want to utilize all the highest damaging skills you have.  You will often see builds that have quickness on demand (Guardian elite "feel my Wrath" for example) save it for the Exposed Phase to really put a dent into the boss' overall health.
---
My problem with undeads is just this weird discomfort thing.  It's not religious or anything.  I can get myself over it.  But it's good to know there are choices!  (I also have a hard time playing bad guys in games.  I'm just weird like that.)

So good! I was just thinking last night while playing WvW, if they ever get around to making a 3rd borderlands map, it would be so dope if it was Canthan! Especially if they never let us actually go back there.. would at least be a nice place to take in the environments. 
---
But actually, think about it. A Canthan Borderlands map basically designs itself:
---
* Spawn is the Imperial Palace, surrounded by Kaineng
---
* Garrison is a big temple like Tahnnakai
---
* SW section of map would be Echovald Forest
---
* SE section of map would be Jade Sea
---
Yeah I mean, I really just want to see Cantha again lmao.
---
According to [this](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/issues/38#issuecomment-459956222) it is currently only possible to use ARCDPS to load d912pxy. Which means you would either use gw2hook or the d912pxy.
---
It's a sick day for me so I've had a look to see what I could find. My first character was a ranger, so I'm guessing you want lots of condition damage, duration and a bit of power. Rangers can get decent bleeding and burning out, and poison from shortbow and traps. You don't really need to worry about defence if you're using your pet to tank for you. 
---
Budget (and I mean really, really budget) rune sets I'd go for until I could afford something better: 
---
* Scavenging (more health, more damage, poison lasts longer)
---
* Balthazar (more condi damage, burning lasts longer) 
---
* Krait (more condi damage, bleeding lasts longer) 
---
I must say, this art style would be really beautiful for Animation. I hope you think about doing a collaboration with someone.
---
Anyway! Beautiful Icons, I'd love to see some Choya (if you haven't yet) and elder dragons.
---
True unpopular opinion: PvP is as shit as ever.
---
Core war is pretty ok even after the nerfs, core guard is actually good, core thief is meta and core necro seems to be realy good after the recent patch.  You can go a long way with a f2p account.
---
Minstrel is a broken stat combination, nothing can compete with it for pure support/tankiness in wvw
---
Lmao I'm not too into that "flasher" aesthetic.
---
I don’t disagree with the notion, but the point of having two of these weapon skins as legendary items is already possible through transmutation.  That’s all I’m saying.  And it’s why it will probably be awhile before we ever see it change.
---
In the game of gw2 you stack or you die.
---
I agree with a lot of what he said about wow BFA really does suck. He just seems like he's being a whiny little baby about it. Maybe cunt was too strong for Reddit sensibilities but I am English so yeah to me he seems like a cunt.

Nah, prefer just showing off all the goods (light armor) instead of that tease aesthetic :P

As far as I remember, it's because there isn't really anything like "tabs" in code, it's just slots, separated visually in client.

---
It's about raids tho, mirage isn't easy to play in raid and mirage in the pvp meta is dead so at least that's something :^(
---
I think the problem with mirage lies within the class mechanics. (just like the scrouge) Meaning the class is either busted OP or just trash. 
---
actually, if they made condi Thief the top dps option you would see more variation as you only can have 2 of them optimally due to the way the venom sharing thing works, which would at least create more varied groups
---
People are making fun of this, but I think they simply were doing the P/D changes and noticed P/nothing was a crap skill so they buffed it. This may come as a shock to you, but not every change was made to make X weapon the golden child of raids. Sometimes they change skills to make the leveling up experience less tedious (see changes to starter hearts)
---
Above user has yet to discover that "very good" and "overpowered" mean different things.
---
I think that's the reason they only sell them as a 5-pack; because selling those "default" skins on their own would seem like a rip-off.
---
I loved HoT at release but it was never really that hard so going to easier, and making the part of the game that *should* be accessible, well..., accessible isn't a bad thing.
---
I agree regarding the CMs... They aren't a good model. Seeing as I've been raiding since the start and I'm still clearing Spirit Vale, I'd rather have the option to do more difficult encounters each week to get some extra loot if my static feels up to it while having easier difficulties to get people into raiding. 
---
I do find it funny though that you inadvertently supported why Largos isn't fine by recommending builds that use Sigil of Energy for damage increase which is... Mirage mainly. The one spec that is a huge outlier on that fight and carrying many groups. The fact that you pretty much need two druids is also an issue. Forced comps don't help with replayability either. 
---
You expected something a-moo-sing.
---
Spouse and I have been playing the game since launch, and I can't say there's anything better than going through the whole story together. Even just exploring the map and doing the meta events has been hugely fun when we're both on! Also its good because you have two people looking for maps that might be doing boss battles or dragons, making it easier to find a winning group. Great way to spend an afternoon together!
---
But a word of warning: play to your preferred style. Spouse is very much a completionist and doesn't want to leave a map or instance until they've gotten *everything* that they can get, meanwhile I'm an explorer and am always rushing to whatever the next step might be and skipping over things like POI and achievements. We drive each other completely insane trying to explore together.
---
Also join a guild! We're in The Sanctuary (LGBT) and it's been a nice sort of neutral zone that gives us both something to do and support when we need help getting something that the other might not be interested in playing through more than once. 
---
I think the best 'duo' build would involve one of you being a necro (Spouse's primary is a necro and mine is an engi). I've recently discovered that necros are crazy OP for PvE because with the right build your minions are essentially 2-5 tanks running up in front of you. If one of you is a necro, the other can be a medium build or even another light armor class without either of you having to worry about either of you needing to be the damage taker.
---
1. Yes there's quite a few pieces of pants armor that are just pants, more for the thief than for the warrior by you won't be short on options. you can preview most of the armor skins in game at any bank or crafter workbench.  
---
2. Yes, you're better of exploring the zones and doing the story to level to 80 but no one's stopping you from using the lvl 60 boosts on your characters to get a headstart. to unlock the elite specs you'll need to get the expansions and stock up on hero points but that's easy enough to do.  
---
3. if by classic caster you mean stationary and spellslinger, elementalist is still an option, just grab a staff and stay in one attunement. Otherwise you have necro with death shroud (or scourge elite spec and desert shroud) or mesmer with illusions and shatters, though that's more of a mobile gameplay.
---
My link --&gt; The two URLs I've linked in the main post of this thread
---
Ben Arnold left. Not Ben P-something. (sorry, cant pronounce that)
---
You have to use the Warclaw specific mount key, not the default one
---
Oh, that's a good point actually
---
I was lucky enough that one of the dyes was Pyre
---
Honestly, it sounds like you haven't been in that many statics. Some will be like that so you stick with them until they dissolve due to disagreements with people getting good and then move on until you find one that sits right with you. Alternatively, you keep moving on until you get one where you are happy.
---
For Matthias just bring a boon thief to make things super sleepy easy and to let the Mirage players get their brokenly high dps logs. Everyone is happy.

What are you talking about?
---
Currently, precursors really aren't worth much. Legendaries dropped like half their value. Which is good for people who just made theirs to sell after the drop. But bad for those who made it before the plunge.
---
I'm not saying a platform, similar to a billboard trading post, where players can say "I have X for sale" and other players can buy it is bad. What's  bad is that the bltc makes money when no other alternative is available. The argument for gold sinks just isn't good enough. There are other ways for gold sinking to be implemented. Making bosses where purchasing a potion(s) is basically required because of the difficulty and then giving non-gold loot but has value in other ways is a good way to sink gold if needed. There can be literally no end to possible ideas that don't screw some players in one way or another.
---
Path of Exile doesn't even use gold. It uses resources as it's main source of trade. Then players just trade item for item. The resource can be used to buy potions, weapons, and armor. And it helps people get equipment without going over the top crazy on needing to grind super stupid hard to get basic level appropriate equipment.
---
Black Desert Online has a 7 day posting system that let's you post and at the end of 7 days if it isn't sold pulls it from the list and you have to repost it. Small items that are weak go for millions of silver because of their economy, but still have no problems being able to purchase items on their trading market.
---
As for convenience, players who know where to go to get their stuff don't really care that much. They'd rather get something for equivalent value than get stiffed somewhere. And if posting costs the seller and it raises those costs, the buyer has to pay more. Which they obviously don't want too.
---
Gold sinks like the way point system is laughable. Anyone can go out and kill 5-10 mobs and make imaginary money to pay for a way point. It's not a sink.
---
You need less gold sinks when you have scarcity. When gold is preset to a certain amount in the game, it becomes rare and valuable. That means that the value of things being traded becomes valuable to a point based upon the demand of said items. You can base the gold limit based off the percentage of players in the game that are active. I doubt they will do that but it will function as a realistic economy and will set value for items and make players more wealthy based upon what they do, which makes them feel accomplished and that they are making progress which is more likely to spur the economy than just making imaginary money pop out of nowhere.
---
As I mentioned, I was in 4 statics but since I'm about to stop raiding anyway I won't try to get in one again.
---
You can't whisper anyone unless you're mutual friends as far as I recall.  
---
I get the frustration, but how are you going to enforce it?
---
Due to the glitchy nature of it and the way names are hidden in wvw, reporting it is difficult on am individual basis. If you manage to see a guild tag group abusing it together, you can try to record video and timestamps to report it, but it's still a question of if they have a way to detect it or not. And then lastly: even if a player knows they can fix it by relogging or map hopping, that potentially means they lose their spot in a large queue for the map with action on it.
---
I'm hoping they fix it soon, but I'm very doubtful they will be able to meaningfully catch cases of abuse unless they're there in real time to see it.
---
It would still help if it's a class that isn't so ridiculously easy to play and so ridiculously safe while doing it. In order to, you know, create a choice. A trade-off. An actual meaningful balance. Unlike the current meta which has been  dominated by no-brainer builds for months.
---
That's the blobgate way.
---
Unfortunately, there is no link to the gw2efficiency crafting calculator on the item pages on the wiki either, not even tradeable ones.
---
The feature to show how much of the needed mats you have in your account is also available on gw2bltc.
---
Wait wait hold on a second there, why would the demo scrapper be affected in any way , its quite clear that the issue is with the new gyros.
---
The old build was okay at best they better not touch it because the gyros are busted.
---
This is a really good point. When I pug, Invigorating Precision and Signet of Ability will be basically permanently on to help make things smoother for a group.
---
When I do training runs, my partner plays magi tempest so that mistakes can happen.
---
However I wouldn't do that in my static since we want quick clears. Adapting for that can take time and sometimes people don't want to put that time to learn together. I think the trick is being able to judge how much time you should give a static to gel. 
---
I use giver's weapons and armor and minstrel trinkets. Ideally you want to use minstrels because of the vitality but I know it's very expensive even to stat swap, so I settled with giver's which is super cheap and works pretty well.
---
some of them. gameplay settings / UI setup / keybindings are tied to your account. deleting local.dat will reset your graphics / sound / launcher settings
---
Hmh. I haven't used pve mounts much for months so that may have been the issue. Honesty don't know which keybind I have set up.
---
At least there is the legendary medium which is not a tre--   ....
---
Do you see the irony in your own comments or are you too stupid for that?
---
I see. So I guess it isn't worth it to truly compete for a place in GW2 PvP since people manipulate it like this. It isn't truly competitive - just pay to win.
---
Adding one more bleeding stack to "Enfeebling Blood" doesn't make much difference for core necromancer. Core Necro is still easily ganked by other pof classes.
---
There isn't one by default. You have to set it up yourself in keybindings
---
I think he is talking about arenanet. With their relesease schedule of everything ... definitely not fuck fetched. 
---
If you could only buy them with actual money then I'd agree, but this is a game that lets players convert in game currency to gems and really that is why they have to do things like this.
---
If they had priced a mount at say 600 for an individual mount, then the reality is most players who not new to the game could simply convert gold to gems to get that, with 2000 on the other hand, that is a lot of gold for many players and a lot of farming, so more likely they have to fund at least some of that purchase with actual money.
---
It is not like GW2 is raking in the the revenue, 2018 Q4 is only made 25% more than Aion, that is pretty bad for a game people claim is one of the few healthy MMORPGs out there. 
---
Hmm so that might be a tricky attribute combination since you're looking to both support groups in small and large scale, and have good damage output in solo runs.
---
I'd get shot for recommending *trying* Celestial armor with two sets of trinkets you swap between depending on the encounter/role you're trying to play... so I *won't* recommend that...
---
*Maybe* Avatar: (Power, Precision major; Vitality, Healing Power minor) or Crusader (Power, Toughness major; Ferocity, Healing Power minor)? It's just a very tricky combination to work with (supporting and dishing out damage). I'd absolutely avoid raiding unless you have a static that's okay with such a combination.
---
Concentration might also be a good one to try to utilize since it will serve you in both supporting and in DPS. Harrier (Power major; Healing Power, Concentration minor) might work in that regard?
---
It sort of falls under the category of "in combat" but PvP and WvW modes make decent use of movement skills too
---
Bannerslave
---
Part of the builds survivability was with bulwark gyro soaking damage pre patch. This got converted to barrier after the patch. If they heavily nerf the barrier then this will likely reduce the survivability of the build below pre patch levels
---
gw2efficiency.com can do that for you. 
---
This hits to the core man
---
For that to happen the need a complete rework for the scrapper , because scrapper’s hammer as a weapon is kinda strong on its own but the scrapper lacks in every other aspect.
---
You have huge downtimes and you cant really kite nor chase like other classes, and you can fix this by using kits but lets face it you have 1 kit that is EG and thats it for complexity, and lets face it hammer EG is super simple to play and quite forgiving aswell due to the innate tankiness of these weapons.
---
In order for scrapper to be semi-competent in any way you need the rest of your kit to be boons or defensive stuff.
---
And as of now you can literally use gyro’s off CD and you will still be unkillable, you dont really have to think anyway. and pre gyro change they were elixirs and the same also applies. 
---
Scrapper since it was released was a brain damaged spec that rewarded you for mashing everything, that was always true and will always stay true unless they change it.
---
Set it as a goal for your group and follow up on it then. Don't be the one to point out mistakes- make them recognize the mistake themselves. Ask the questions like "what happened?" "what could we have done to prevent it". Everyone needs to be held accountable in a static. It's not ever a case of "it's the druid's fault" because you KNOW your druid in a static. Help them improve, improve your whole static.
---
Instanced content with no mounts. PvP. Combat. Farming resources also favours them, in some cases (mounting/dismounting takes time) so you dont want to use it if nodes close enough (but you still want to reach them faster).
---
What's a job with a pretty basic rotation as far as DPS goes? I want to focus on learning mechanics, etc and so far with my mesmer it can be difficult. Would prefer something with decent survivability but also does respectable damage in the open world and such. 
---
Thanks!
---
**DPS**: follow your rotation as best you can while avoiding attacks (the combination of abilities that, when looped, will give you the highest damage output). Necro rotations are pretty simple, and you can find the best builds/rotations on snowcrows.com or metabattle.com.
---
**CC**: make the blue "defiance" bar run out. as a necro you've got pretty decent baseline cc. Fear is great cc for example
---
You dont need to follow a rotation 100%, just know what your best abilities are and be able to use them at a moments notice.
---
I was judging by the reactions i got from several guildmates of the guild i mentioned when it comes to difficulty scales. No idea if that is upscalable to the broad audience though. It feels like it, but maybe thats just me.
---
They're amazing! I'd love to see some with transparent background.
---
This so much.  I have been playing mostly small scale skirmishes since the balance patch.  Man, scrappers are a little too strong as support in small scale fights.  I help defend camps at home BL a lot so I don’t get the luxury of many allies.  When the invaders come with a scrapper(s), it is almost impossible to kill any of the enemies when the numbers are even.  And if things go south, they stealth down enemies and themselves, Rez relatively quickly and off we go again.  Again, I am talking about really small scale fights, 2-5 vs same number.  They might be balanced in Zerg fights due to high damage pressure, I am not sure.  
---
But I am really glad scrapper is seeing play, some skills just need to be tweak, maybe to work differently depending on number of allies around you.
---
ranger: pretty boring, thief: even more boring, ele: can be interesting
---
Leads me to wonder why the guild flag wasn't part of the base design.....
---
In all fairness, dungeons' loot is rather good. The gold they give is also decent.
---
As for the "no one plays them" statement I cannot agree as I have never had an issue finding a group except at very odd hours.
---
A common mistake is to wait for a party to spawn in LFG, this is a bad habit since all the people waiting could easily gather and go clear but won't if noone dares creating his party. Creating your own party also allows you to ask for specifics (only lv80 ? skipping ? clearing ? watching cinematics ? and so on).
---
In my opinion the existing dungeons are fine as they are besides bug fixing. New dungeons however would be really welcome because having something to do outside of the context of fractals is really nice.

Double check it's not in your bank or something?
---
Praise MUSKO!!!
---
The nerf of gold rewards and then arrival of fractals killed off dungs. Shame really, i loved dungeons
---
The rewards aren’t the worst just the unique rewards have been farmed to death and are also meaningless now. Back before HoT crafting the unique stat rings and such was a decently easy way to get some gold but now those stats on an exotic are everywhere and also useless. 
---
Still, I’d love to see them bring some love to dungeons and bring them up to date and maybe start adding new ones with living story. 
---
In GW2 necromancer is just a strange choice of name for what would be a summoner in many other games. I would suggest you look into it and try to play for a couple of levels just to get the feel.
---
I can also confirm that minion master is the easiest solo build. In your case, it also has an additional benefit of not needing 100% focus: The minions will take hits and do damage even if you are not paying attention. It really helps when you have children who want something right here and now.
---
Good ol’ Musky!
---
Trade contracts only? Which npc? The ones I remember asks other items as well.

You can whisper people that are non-mutual friends every 30 seconds.

Wow. Let's hope you ~~don't~~ use the same username for GW2.

I play the game with my wife, we just hit our one year mark of game play. we started out just doing PVE, working on our story, exploring ( we really enjoyed finding all the vistas), getting our mounts, joining a guild .. she did World vs World trying to find some spoon for an achievement - and now we WvW most nights  when we play.  She is also dipping her toe in PvP - so I just follow her around and try and not die - it’s fun and it gives us one more thing to talk about.
---
You can ALSO whisper people who are on the same map. This came in really handy from time to time.
---
It says the opposite ...
---
&gt; We've been looking at ways to improve the **pistol main-hand and dagger off-hand** build for thieves. We wanted to give the weapon pair a little more lethality without improving other weapon sets or removing current utility, so we decided to go with the mechanic we used for Tow Line during the underwater update. This allows Shadow Strike to flip over to Repeater for a period of time.
---
Hmmm, nothing. I'll check all my characters to see if somehow they've got it, but I've only ever taken my main to Istan so I can't imagine why I'd have moved the tool.
---
Super speed is higher than runes of speed make swiftness -- and rev could be running it also so they'll be faster with and still just as fast without.
---
But yes, for any foot race, runes of speed would be basically a requirement for whoever wanted to win.
---
I prefer playing alone then having to explain people wait voice in the void how vg works.
---
Great idea!
---
Above user has yet to figure out that incredible and very are different
---
Oh oops! Thanks tokzic for posting the links and your honest feedback; I’m sending good vibrations to your juju antenna.
---
Glad to hear that these spark so much joy!
---
No, dungeons do not need a rework. They are fun as they are now. If anything, we need NEW dungeons in the style of the old ones.
---
And I'm so sick of hearing that the loot is bad. Dungeons are more profitable than they've ever been right now with the addition of the dungeon frequenter title an even more so with dungeon recipes and a good team. Honestly one of the best g/hour in the game if you understand how to convert currencies into gold.
---
Damn, they really white washed Elona this time around.
---
It doesn't have good boons.
---
It doesn't have good damage.
---
It is very tanky.
---
Scrapper is doing its job... Being tanky is the purpose of the elite spec. If we should nerf Scrapper for being good at its purpose, then we should also destroy Scourge for being good at area denial and Spellbreaker for deleting boons.
---
&gt;Repeater: For builds that use a pistol in their main hand with no off-hand weapon, the damage of this skill has been increased by 20%. 
---
You seem to have things backwards. ANet would have to implement DX12 first THEN they might be able to get MS to help with a similar thing to support it on w7.
---
Mounts are in the PoF expansion.  No, unfortunately, on your first character, you can't use them from the start.  They're unlocked as you work your way through the PoF expansion, and that requires you to be level 80.  However, once you have a mount unlocked any future new character you create can use it from their start.  Which I realize isn't very comforting right now.
---
The first mount is obtained by doing the first mission of Path of Fire. You won't be able to survive that mission with being high level with good gear, or getting a lot of help. You'll also need to be high level with good gear to survive the process of getting the various masteries you want/need with the mounts.
---
Gliding is obtained in Heart of Thorns. Again, you'll need to be high level with good gear to survive getting the masteries that make gliding worthwhile.
---
Yes but it isnt active right now. Hmm think Im gonna post some icons these days haha. https://www.instagram.com/ilona_iske_art/
---
As much as I agree that dungeons need some love, it’s not true that no one runs them. There are usually parties in the LFG and if you start one in primetime it doesn’t take that long to fill. 
---
The rewards in the dungeons itself are bad, that’s true. However, some meta runes are available only through dungeons (Monk and Nightmare) and there are various good armor and weapon skins. But these rewards should be comparable to raids or fractals, so an increase in gold and/or the possibility of ascended chests could fix that.
---
I’m pretty sure we won’t see dungeons being totally redone, but some changes in Dungeon Vendors and/or drop tables could improve the situation. Increasing the gold reward for the Dungeon Frequenter achievement would help too.
---
So what about the gem aura outfit :D
---
At least not the Frogs.
---
There is also the executioner axe ...
---
I use my movement skills all the time while farming. Getting out of combat so I can mount up is the main reason I use rocket boots or thief's shortbow.
---
I don't think it is forbidden to use 2 ore more keyboards, as long as you respect the rule that one hit just do one action you will be fine.
---
We need new dungeons and a hard mode for each. Make it like easy raids but much higher difficulty than current dungeons. This will make players have access to content to ease their way into raids+we will have good dungeon population. Give half the rewards of raids and introduce some raid mechanics on dungeon final bosses. Ez.
---
&gt; a serious rework on dungeons
---
That's never going to happen. The devs have said multiple times that nobody currently at Arenanet is familiar with the code for the dungeons and several of them are too fragile to touch.
---
I can't speak for the meta 'cause I'm not that level yet but Magi has more healing power while Marshal shaman has more dps. If you're new to fractal and to the class, it may be more helpful to start with Magi. Once you know the rotation better you can move to a more dps build. For pugs, it is usually better to bring a hood healer. For experienced group who know how to defend and survive, you can manage a bit more dps.
---
I should have probably said new dungeons lol
---
&gt; Its just that most pugs dont know how to run them these days
---
On the other hand power creep has also made a lot of stuff unnecessary.
---
Nothing sayed about how they allowed it or what features are in check.
---
\-We solved overpopulation problem!
---
\-How?
---
\-Nukes!

They are employees like any other. They work and they get money, there's nothing exceptional about their work. Firefighters or lifeguards are worth praising. Game devs? Regular people.

Thanks so much for making them free to use, real MVP

Of course it's not that easy, nor fun, to post on all medias when you're an artist.

---
By the way, what offers more Tumblr for artists than Instagram? (:
---
Yeah but he's only truly good and fun in 1.
---
You're not soloing the dungeons right?
---
oof those are awesome! Have you considered doing commissions for your icon work? I see you are offering a few more free slots via tumblr, but honestly a good icon is hard to come by these days
---
&gt; before people start yelling OP just because a neglected spec is now viable again, take a step back and see why it’s like that. 
---
Well said, and I agree.  The fact that PvP and WvW has, up to now, consisted of all Holosmiths and virtually zero Scrappers is indicative of the power-creep in PoF classes.  It's about time that an underutilized HoT class was put on even ground with its PoF counterpart.
---
I'd like to see the same treatment for Berserker, Dragon Hunter, and possibly Druid.  Reaper, and Daredevil, and Herald have had a super-strong presence in both game modes for quite a while now, and Tempest recently got some buffs.
---
Ive not seen this. Most folk I've seen on mounts generally don't actively hunt players. Neither do zergs, as its not worth the time and effort.
---
There are roamers who use mounts. Half of them will dismount before engaging some will try to engage with the mount.
---
THIS IS A COW ZONE.
---
How now
---
I am curious why many consider condition mirage easy to play?
---
For most builds, I just follow the  rotation guide and can easily achieve \~90% of the benchmark dps. But for mirage, it was so hard to get even close to those benchmarks. I am getting like 60-70% of the dps benchmark on a golem even after practice. 
---
Am I missing some tricks here to play this build?
---
Out of combat mobility skills are a tumor on the overall class design. They provide exclusively negative feedback (take one to move faster? Your build is gimped. Didn't take one? Enjoy your snail speed). That skill category, at large, should not exist in the game.   
---
That said, in-combat mobility skills should also be ruled with an iron fist, being distributed extremely sparingly only to some builds, because mobility creep is an issue prevalent in modern day game design, and GW2 is no exception. It largely invalidates ranged combat and adds an unnecessary aspect to the arms race between builds. They can be clutch if executed right, but adding each next mobility skill devalues every one that came before it.
---
woosh
---
&gt; Make it like easy raids but much higher difficulty than current dungeons.
---
So fractals? and cms ?
---
And not have said ‘rework’. ;)
---
Please don't. I agree with you that the loot is not as good but honestly I'm afraid of Anet's re-works given what they did to fractals. I rather it be subpar but still playable with pug than going from original Molten Boss to new version, or pre-instability re-work to now.
---
&gt; Oh my god, this is the most embarassing thing ever. 
---
Oh sweet, summer child... what a blessed life you must live.
---
Glad it's sorted!
---
These kind of things aren't as common as people make it out to be.
---
Fractals.
---
You have a classic case of confirmation bias, best to rid yourself of it. 
---
Have you played any decently ranked PvP since the last patch? 
---
This is a bunker meta, wake up and see all the nodes being bunkered down on.
---
[Sneakthief](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sneakthief_armor) is just pants
---
I thought you needed an expansion to convert gold to gems?
---
I think it's fair to say that the method for fixing it is at least a little arcane, especially in a game mode which until recently had no mounts.
---
I think you'd probably be fine with "duck". By itself, it's pretty obvious that that's its own word and not what they might think is an alternate spelling of something offensive.
---
Did you try contacting support when it happened and they just didn't give you an explanation? It might be a bit late now to ask since it's several months down the line.
---
Just drink it
---
This will require a scrap and remake approach, which is extremely unlikely.
---
I would like to see dungeons reworked into light raids for training newcomers. Need to train someone on Sabetha? Have them go through Citadel of Flame, where the end Boss follows those mechanics in similar fashion. Players who join your guild that have never stepped into a raid will have encounter knowledge from doing these dungeons.
---
Am I the only one that thought of [https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/dog/dog-and-puppy-flea-and-tick/frontline-plus-flea-and-tick-treatment-for-large-dogs](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/dog/dog-and-puppy-flea-and-tick/frontline-plus-flea-and-tick-treatment-for-large-dogs), and wondered why our mounts apparently *already* have flea/tick issues?
---
Petey is, of course, the cutest of the mounts.
---
Very nice icons! Now we just need a Quaggan &lt;3
---
Or you really just don't understand how this sale works.
---
mooo.
---
I have played over 30 games since patch. The general meta we have is very bursty and I'm happy to see the balance swing a bit towards defense and healing.
---
Thank you for trying to help!
---
&gt;Am I just obsessive or does the Guardian trait lines need a rework?
---
from what I can tell with your post you have no clue how to build a guard.
---
Unless we are talking WvW where all the meme crap stats you talked about have some level of application.
---
It's a bug.. not a exploit. 
---
You can't even swap weapons, so any sigils on that other weapon becomes useless, it was annoying when there were queues everywhere.
---
Maybe in a week or two, closer to the end.
---
Im never that bored to do this. I'd rather go outside.
---
Ohhh, you wanted to say that your links are newer, than the comments from Anet that I linked. Then to answer that: There has not been a comment by anyone at Anet about dx12 support since yesterday...
---
Anet is most likely not involved in this, as they repeatedly stated, over many years, that they would not move away from DirectX 9.
---
You fell for the bait.
---
FB just utterly overshadows DH in wvw, simple as that.
---

Kinda just assumed by now that the QoL stuff would be on sale on the weekends though.
---
Fretting over and giving a stage to such a troll isn't improving the situation whatsoever... Just block and carry on and engage with the people who dó positively approach you.
---
I hate wasting minor traits, but I understand your point.
---
Weekends and later end of the sale.
---
Hey cool just like every other game mode.
---
Popular stuff like that usually happens on Saturdays.
---
Now I’m curious what your character looks like...
---
if you feel insulted, just report in game, block and move on. 
---
Why post this on reddit? Maybe they got a point, you want the attention...
---
The issue with chrono bunker was the fact that they brought zoning with wells, and had old Well of Precognition. So they could control the point and you couldn't hit them for significant periods of time. Combined with alacrity the window of opportunity to do something against them was tiny. 
---
Scrapper is just bringing heals and barrier.

I need to craft [Basic Mithril Greatsword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Basic_Mithril_Greatsword) but I can't discover it and the recipe isn't for sale from the master weaponsmith vendor (i'm lvl 500). Can anyone help?
---
Thank you! , i already have one Balthazar and have like 50 gold, so i guess im ready to be productive soon now.
---
And i hope you get better mate!
---
They generally have "local" event chains that build up to a bigger event at the end. Look for little orange circles with a cross in for the event person.
---
For example, in Verdant Brink, the five different outposts have little story events where you help that outpost build up its strength, then a night-time meta where you take out bosses and build up bases. 
---
Tangled Depths has something similar: you work through a chain of about nine events in each location (well, just one or two in one go if you really push it) then the big event chain starts.  
---
Auric Basin generally has people start at, say, North and work round and end up at East, then there's the big fight at the end. At the end, four teams need to work together and communicate in a synchronised attack.
---
Dragon's Stand needs three squads to, roughly, work together down three lanes. 
---
The Skimmer, Springer and Classic Griffon can be found in the previous batch. :)
---
Bull, I can stand my ground against mesmers, scourges, other engineers, pretty much most things usually up to three at a time no sweat.  But a power reaper, a good rev or a warrior hard counter me and down me in seconds.  That's balanced if I ever saw it.
---
Warrior doesn't die easily and I found it to be the easiest class to level. Axe/Axe should melt all trash mobs in your leveling journey. If you want you can pm me and I can give you in depth details on game later on to help you out.
---
Like others said, learn to dodge often, learn to proc fury before using A/A skill 5. You might also want to focus on getting power and precision gear only. A lot of new players make the mistake of getting the wrong gear when they start. Run Healing signet, Signet of Fury, and Signet of Might while leveling. They provide a good amount of inactive bonuses that will help you rush though your leveling process and you can focus more on dodging those incoming attack animations.
---
Some people might say signets will make you a bad player because it promotes not using skills but I think that once you reach a high enough level and are comfortable with your attacks and dodging you can then incorporate slot skills into your rotation for more damage on endgame pve content.
---
Oh we weren't bored :P That's half the fun of guild raids!
---
Get the fuck outta here with your logic and your critical thinking, I don’t want answers I want to be angry.
---
Fifty Shades of Sand.
---
&gt; Thank you! , i already have one Balthazar and have like 50 gold, so i guess im ready to be productive soon now.
---
50 gold is a reasonably high amount so you can probably splash out on some better runes! The ones I gave you were, basically, cheap tat as I think I had 3 gold when I got to level 80...
---
What kind of animation? :) Like an animated short or just some simple .gif like images? I'm an animation student so I have knowledge of animating in After Effects. (But I am more the pre-production type) so I would rather hand the animation part to someone else haha. :P
---
Look at the ability that person had to change your mood. Honestly just report + ignore rather than publicly shaming them. If the other player is *genuinely* riled up like this over cosmetics in an on-line game, they probably aren't worth your time. The best counter-troll is to just keep existing as is.
---
Bots / Macro
---
Well i think we can't use script for gw2. At final, xe use combo key : F24±x xD Virtuql key or not, i think gw will don't apreciat.
---
I will check other solutions. Ty ^^
---
Yes!
---
SINISTER/GRIEVING (aka fuck support skills)
---
That's not how you play Renegade lol. Renegade is extremely active and should be hitting skills constantly to drain energy. You're not supposed to use the Kalla elite at all actually, it's just a situational skill for when your party is dying, or if you've messed up the rotation so bad that you need extra energy drained off. Even then if you need to drain energy you're better off hitting F2 or F4.
---
lay it off
---
 Standard launch options should work
---
* \-w &lt;width&gt; - Forces the engine to start with resolution set to &lt;width&gt;.
---
* \-h &lt;height&gt; - Forces the engine to start with resolution set to &lt;height&gt;. This launch option does not need to be set in the presence of -w. The width value will determine the height automatically.
---
I did the same test using a https://www.gw2tp.com/item/33345-dull-knife which has no stats
---
Using 100 hits (20 activations of repeater)
---
110.5k pistol
---
104.9k pistol/dagger
---
That damage difference is less than you would get simply from the weapon strength's high and low.
---
The phrasing is fine assuming a reasonable level of reading comprehension. It's a pretty standard "learn something then apply it in the next section thing". It should also be noted that it did not say "damage has been increased only if there is no offhand equipped". On the other hand GW2's patch notes have never been the most accurate so testing is best ...
---
a lot of my matches last night ran out of time instead of a team reaching 500 points landmark. the only thing that outplay here is which team has more cc. so you knock enemies out to gain a tick each time like that. cuz all 3 nodes were contested and both team barely got any kill since everyone is running sustain builds.  
---
the only time i killed people is when my elite is up. all the boons are stripped into condi. and i save my shroud as well as f2 for that too. 
---
the meta is still bursty. holo, mirage, chrono, boonbeast, etc. what is not balance to me is while some builds deal insane damage, some builds have crazy sustain. so we have what we have now and it's not fun to play at all. just to point that out. 
---
&gt; and a bit of condition damage for burning attacks
---
Why do people always try to do this on support guards? You're just wasting stats.
---
Hi, I'm someone who got into WvW because of Warclaw.
---
Serious question, what's the deal with passionate WvW players?
---
I just don't see myself getting so emotionally invested into this mode that I'd start bashing commanders and pve players. I feel no server wide camaraderie, and as long as I'm earning pips and WXP I don't really care what happens even if it turns into "ktrain" or whatever.
---
"Forever stuck in T#" - Why not just transfer into a T1 server?
---
"Commander sucks blah blah it's easy etc." - Why not take command then?
---
I think it's insane how the servers as a whole managed to defend an objective, but still have players in it still so angry with a random tag for not immediately coming to the rescue.
---
i know right! but when everyone has so much sustain, we barely get there. our sustain definitely cover for our mistakes. we were fighting to the point that we were bored and just traded personnels for each node and that changed nothing. lol
---
How are elitists and tryhards the problem? It's not like you are forced to run a certain group comp, but especially in pug's using "meta" builds gives you a higher chance of getting a kill usually. Also considering 90% of people don't read their skills or traits or optimise them for a certain boss, it is very hard on Matthias for example trying to get someone else to reflect other than a mirage or chrono as people are braindead and refuse to take other skills and do mechanics. Aslo these people tend to be more casual raiders not tryhards.
---
My idea is about an Animated Short, and again with a actual Animator you'd collaborate with! Either way, Animated Short or with .gif's this would be beautiful in any Animation format, to me. It's just my thought that your Art would be perfect for short 1 or 20 minute Animations, Voiced Dialogue or just Sounds, I'd watch the hell out of it. But that idea is a challenging thing to do.
---
I have no digital artistic claims or offers. I've only drawn on Paper with Pencil, I'm a black and white artistic neanderthal! Just a fellow internet-weirdo lovin' your artistic pixels!
---
For the community aspect: Most people have been on the same server for YEARS. The names you see talking in Team chat have been the same for years. You keep your trolls, your saints, your scouts, and usually, your guilds for years. Some guilds rise and some fall. Some are incredibly stable while others form and reform as the patches roll out. Your server has **history** and **culture** in how it chooses to attack or defend objectives. Your server may even have **rivalries** with other servers that has transcended guilds. Some servers are known for heavy seige defense. (Isle of Janthir, what's it like knowing your precious ACs got nerfed? Hmm?) Some servers have scouts that are famous ON OTHER SERVERS for always being there to defend. This being when you can't even read their names without some effort! Some servers love having their spawn tower on enemy BLS T3ed (Why? I don't get it?). Others actively manipulate their server scores to drop multiple tiers for weeks in a row. (BG, this means you!) Some servers (FA cough) will chose fights over objectives AND THEY LIKE DOING THAT.
---
So if you're into server loyalty, then WvW is the only way you can show that.
---
All the people criticising commanders are dumb. People whining about their server stuck in whatever tier are just whiners.
---
Still don't get it? Join a WvW guild and get into voice more often. Join your servers discord (Or the WvW Discord. AKA Cancer Discord. There's a lot going on under the hood that you don't really see unless you know the context.
---
Yes, if you list the best aspects of every class you can make anything sound OP.
---
Reaper has: a second healthpool *at the press if a button* that gives it quickness *and* ferocity * a 33% crit chance. Every time it hits it gets free crit chance, letting it both run tank armor and do max dps at the same time. It’s unaffected by condis in this form, has a *10m, instant mobility skill that counts as a finisher*, and an attack that can do **40k damage** and is a finisher. Too top it off, almost every skill is a chill, and it can potentially have perma super-speed with runes of speed. On top of constant 25 might stacks and the ability to instantly shit out 25 vuln, with plenty of fears and CCs
---
Do we call reaper OP? no. But when you list literally a classes top strenghts you can make anythinf *sound* OP and it’s really disingenuous and it’s gotta stop. 
---
If you want something that’s truly OP when listed out, look at mirage. It took a 15 minute video to list everything mirage had, and we could all universally agree that mirage was OP as shit.
---
Instagram you cant really upload images from your computer unless you do some workarounds. Also a smaller audience. Tumblr has a wider audience that is catered more for artists. I'd argue Twitter is becoming one of those places for artists but the image scaling can be ass.
---
Awesome! By the way, where did you get that music? It's different to the version that's on anet's soundcloud https://soundcloud.com/arenanet/superadventurebox-sunnyglade
---
listen. I understand when you kick non-meta classes out of a squad when it has 50/50 or is nearly full. but than stop crying that "we have queues, but no full squads". just put these classes in a separate group, so they can at least read the squadchat too ffs...
---
every commander who kicks ppl out of a 30 man squad is a moron.
---
Thats what appaled me..the squad wasn't full. I believe it was at 35 when I attempted to join it.
---
Now we need Elon M.O.X. riding a Musk OX on the Elon river, while wielding an Elon Dusk at dusk. 
---
Core necro pretty much obliterates anyone that doesn't/can't disengage and kite at the right times though. It's still not the best, but you can pull off some wins with it tbh.
---
As the wiki says, unlocked from either Twilight or Sunrise Volume 2, which is purchased from Grandmaster Craftsman Hobbs *Purchasable after crafting the Dusk Experiment and training the Magister of Legends mastery.*
---
I only wanted the cheetah one so I passed on buying the whole package deal.  
---
This post is a about being in a squad/zerg and fighting with them. This has nothing to do with roaming and scouting. For a big WvW squad fighting another big WvW squad SB does not contribute much compared to what many other classes/builds can do.
---
You do not need to be in squad to roam at all. Scouts may sometimes have a couple of spots in squad if a tag really want scouts and gives them participation and such but them you still are socuting a structure, not fighting with the zerg (give or take the moments when the zerg comes to defend what you scout).
---
You unlock the recipe when you unlock the second part of the twilight/sunrise collection.
---
I actually rather like the trait line implementation of elite specs. It ensures that no single elite spec will *completely* invalidate class identity, since any elite spec still has 2/3 of its "DNA" in core traits. And the flexibility within the elite trait lines has made pretty much every class have 2 or more viable builds, which is a far cry from vanilla GW2. It lets builds specialize harder into support, condi, bunker, or power than they otherwise would, without being entirely new things. Some of the best designed lines are things like Firebrand and Holosmith which can swing between two powerful options, augmented by different core traits and skills. Just look at the difference between condi Scourge, support Scourge, WvW marauder Scourge, power Reaper, and open world minion Reaper. 
---
This has been said 1000 times... 
---
1. Its the commander choice to include or exclude anyone they want from their squad? Unhappy? Make your own all inclusive squad.
---
2. Classes that don't offer much to a large group are simply not welcomed in large groups. Soul Soulbeasts are more of a roaming class. Unhappy? Get on a class that offer something to a group or solo/small group roam.
---
Wait, there are 9 mounts now??? 
---
Oh no...
---
Power Soulbeast, Greatsword/Sword/Axe.
---
Great, easy ramped damage, self-stacks fury, might, swiftness and has good CC.
---
Weapon rotation is GS 2-5-2-4-4, swap, 4-5-111111 until swap. For brownie points, use Vulture Stance and Sic 'em only while in GS right before your 2-5-2 combo. 
---
I've never played mirage.  But from reading many, many comments on this sub, I feel confident in this advice:  Ignore every mechanic and ability except dodge.  All a mirage ever has to do is dodge.
---
Are you suggesting we should call ANet liars when they come out and tell us something like what they've told us about nobody at ANet being able to touch dungeons? Would you like to offer some kind of proof that ANet is giving us plates of bullshit? Or are you just trying to be a shit-disturber?
---
The hate is most people want one particular thing (this differs, apparently people actually want to buy keys, I'm very shocked!)
---
And this isn't it. Rage culture and all. So the hate.
---
This is true; almost every game mode seems to be in need of some attention except for OW and Raid/Fractals.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Maybe a GW3 is in order..
---
Do you like the Zerg aspect and comradeship? 
---
What are you missed out on someone yelling in voice chat or  a discord bot with kick arse music?
---
I like to roam but if I help others I don’t need to be in party or squad. 
---
Helping is helping i like that freedom.
---
Whoa whoa... You will piss of a lot of people around here with those words. 
---
But I agree. Shhhh.
---
Yes, all of you are right. I didn't realize until later that GW2 doesn't run in Dx12 under W10 (that's why d912pxy exists)
---
oh ok :/
---
Absolutely, their design on the whole is great with how they interact with base trait lines, but that does tend towards making them mandatory rather than optional. That they provide unique abilities, unique ultimate and an additional weapon choice has lent them a concrete advantage. There is no easy solution and I honestly don’t see it changing, it’s more of “in an ideal world” dreaming on my part. On the whole I’m happy with them.
---
Commanders have every right to tailor their composition however they wish. It's exactly the same as if you brought a shout heal warrior into a raid. It's not the commander's job to deal with your build.
---
You're free to tag along with the group, but commanders want the boons from their Heralds and Firebrands to hit the classes that are actually valuable in a zerg, not the random Soulbeast. If you're unaware, 5/10 man buffs that hit more than their target cap prioritize the caster first, subgroup second, and then the squad.
---
This is what usually happens on large T1/T2 fight servers:
---
\- High/Full Pop
---
\- 50+ man queue per BL
---
\- Toxic Teammates 
---
\- Population that will likely dwindle out after a few months (except for BG)
---
\- No commander on EBG despite 50 man queue.
---
\- When there is a Commander they're a dick that demands their zerg play meta
---
\- Aids Map Chat
---
I would say find a better, more relaxed T3/T4 server to play on, queues are much shorter and Commanders don't usually care what you play.  I know it might have been tempting to join high pop servers because you want an active WvW, but after playing on T1 (in the past, CD, Mag) for a few months I got tired of all the annoyances that come with playing on a Full/High Pop server.
---
Also people hate LB Rangers because they don't know how to counterplay against them
---
But it's only 18% upvoted so they'll scrap it now. Damn you all!! 
---
At this point it's "any expansion please"
---
If it's because he doesn't notice when he takes damage, try adjusting camera height/FOV so that he can easily see his HP and his character at the same time.
---
If he has trouble seeing enemies and AoEs, turn on Show All Enemy Names and consider turning off postprocessing.
---
If that doesn't help, is recording his gameplay an option? You might be able to review the footage with him and point out how he needs to move the camera around more, or not stand still while trying to figure out what's hitting him. You could also just watch him play instead of looking at a recording, but sometimes it's like criticizing how someone drives: they're more likely to take it personally while they're behind the wheel, and they can't fully focus on what you're saying anyway.
---
😄
---
Thats basically what I did. I was in discord to listen to the commander and made my own party of outcasted rangers and we followed the zerg and called targets to melt folk down. Dropped like flies 1 by 1.
---
The experience wasnt bad by any means. It was still fun. But it still doesn't feel good to be left out because your class fantasy doesnt live up to the other classes.
---
And about the loud music, happened aswell, then I learned it was a bot at max sound and I all I had to do is turn it down..felt dumb lmao
---
There's always going to be a disparity amongst classes in-terms of optimal compositions and kill-times.  However, I think that confusion scaling is far too strong on certain bosses and crowds out available competition.  I think it's unhealthy to have a class that does 20-25% more damage than its competition *and* for that damage to somewhat "hidden" in confusion procs.  If it's okay for some bosses to be more susceptible to confusion, could it also be okay for other bosses to be more susceptible to bleeding, burning or poison damage? Confusion is the real issue right now as Luna pointed out.  
---
and Smoldering Sigils with Burn Duration Food.
---
It's sad when, in a world you think has become better, people still have to use 'unpopular opinion' in their title - as though going against the common opinion of things is bad. Kinda like how 'conspiracy theorists' are almost considered to be 'thought terrorists' simply for questioning things and saying 'what if'. Very interesting.
---
Love these 😍
---
Play Spellbreaker or Reaper. You pretty much chew them up. If you play a condi class versus a smart scrapper you're going to have a bad time watching those conditions become boons.
---
Of course if you play those two classes prepare to hate aoe condi spams.
---
If you need a zerg full of FBs and Scourges to win a fight, you should probably get better PVP
---
The floating orbs are Aurora’s peaches 
---
Well, you're sorta right when you put it that way, but I simply had in mind a decently looking *chair* such as the Club Chair, and not a norn-style shabbier and savagier stool.

I did find a way to cheese through a bit.  Nightly HP trains.

---
This explains the gist of it. 
---
Agree 100% on the idea of mobility creep. A lot of game developers tend to lose sight of these very simple things- being ranged should be an advantage, melee should do more damage but struggle with staying on target/alive, healers should be squishy or have a limited battery, etc. I gotta respect that you're paying attention to the old school rock/paper/scissors roots.
---
That said, I think my point was more related to existing skills losing relevancy rather than adding more or buffing them per se. Rocket boots, for example, would be much more appealing if you could just jump and land in place for a quick blast finisher in the many situations where mobility isn't actually needed.
---
have an upvote cos I never felt connected with these memes up until now. It's because i have the invitation and can visit this glorious place at a whim, every day, i think.
---
This is not the point, put a full "meta" squad against a squad with lots for LB Rangers and see who wins most of the fights because of their sustain, control and AoE damage.
---
But in a way your comment shows that you actually know that FB, Scourges and such make a superior squad that LB rangers and you just wanted to troll for the sake of trolling so yeah have a nice evening and cya!

Predicted in the 1950's
---
I totally understand you,
---
but really wvw doesn't give you much of a choice: continue as you were doing so far
---
or just make alt not really super core meta if you don't like classes just sth which is more welcome to wvw most of the time and the most important choose class you will enjoy playing.
---
Honestly when you think about it somehow make sense why ranger is not the best, it is a teamplay and ranger doesn't provide much, I guess it was good for solo roaming but now with mounts I'm not sure if it still can be a thing. Plus I wouldn't enjoy roaming solo, the thing that bring me joy in wvw is running with others.
---
My personal opinion it is good to have variety one class for pve one or wvw, or overall to change dynamic of own playstyle (unless it is just me, but I really enjoy switching in between 7 classes depending of situations or mood)
---
yeah sadly in my case it wasn't a music bot last time, so it felt slightly stupid since I pretty much heard everything from super far away, but also as you had bot issue once and felt stupid as well xD
---
Anyways good luck finding your way, no matter what you do, try to always have fun and enjoy it and be content with your decision and really maybe give yourself a try to other class just for more fun experience. 
---
man we must run with vastly different randoms when we do our dungeons then, I can't for the life of me find a group that actually wants to kill things and insists on skipping everything that isn't a needed fight
---
What you do is simple.
---
Use LB 5, afk, and leech. If they don't want you in squads, that's fine. Just do the bare minimum and leech the way they expect you to leech. :)
---
No reason to get hurt over their salty and toxic nature.
---
Ugh, enough with the Elon Musk posts...
---
I am playing the  illusion/dueling build which you can stack a lot of confusion by shattering a lot. I thought that is the dominant condi build in raid that OP was talking about. 
---
The old chaos build does feel easy to play by just spamming dodges. But that build is not really doing super high dps.
---
Really like the mood on this one! 
---
One of my earliest screenshots was of my lil Asura saying 'How now?' next to two brown cows. Still brings a smile to my face.
---
You are absolutely seeing wrong the impact on the mesmer in PvP.
---
&gt; it takes about 5 to 8 hours to get the mount
---
As long-term WvW players, we need to stop spreading BS like this. Minimum time to complete a reward track is over 8.5 hours. That does not take into consideration the effect of WXP boosters, but it also does not take into consideration the fact that permanently maintaining tier 6 participation is required. Many new players aren't going to have any WXP boosters and they're also going to have difficulty maintaining tier 6 when they can't keep up with the zerg. If you're not permanently maintaining tier 6, it's going to take much longer than 8 hours to complete the reward track.
---
Also, everyone needs to remember that the other problem with mounted groups is that they don't share ANY boons with the people around them. That means no shared swiftness.
---
I don't think it's *that* extreme. I'm trying to have some fun and relax with my favourite class by joining a half full squad while there's a  100 people queue. And not an NBA League. 
---
"To each their own." 
---
That's why I love Gw2. There many modes, contents, and you are not forced to one.
---
If you see a commander on your map who is using a mount, that commander has made the decision that he doesn't want new players with his squad. That's unfortunate for you, but then again he can play the game however he wants to play it. For you, the only good solution is to keep an eye out for commanders who don't mount up until just before enemy contact.
---
Cantha expantion is a bad idea though because gw2 is also in china. You either don't release the expc in china or just make a diffirent one. As a company, which would you pick? Ladder is the correct answer.
---
If I want a legendary weapon im forced to do so or an i wrong with that aswell?

One person made a meme on it and a bunch of other people made some more obvious ones for that sweet karma. 
---
Yea I guess so. Sure but I don't get why you would make this a thing you have to unlock first. I didn't mean to blame the players here
---
Fractals are the new dungeons. Whether we like it or not.
---
Sad that people feel so insecure to make posts just for karma :-/
---
I don't get why people expect keys early. A lot of players buy tons of those, so it's smart for arenanet to wait until a lot of people burn gold and hike up the gold-gems conversion so that more people start pouring real money into buying stuff. 
---
I'd suggest trying a more mobile class. I completed my warclaw unlock entirely on Herald, so even though I fell behind I had permaswiftness to help me catch up every time the zerg stopped for a fight or objective. Another option is to play in EotM while it's still active (due to map queues) since the mount is disabled there, although reward track progress will be slower.
---
Everyone told me elementalist is the hardest, well it is the most rewarding for sure and I guess you have to put the most thoughts into it while fighting due to cooldowns for elements and when it comes to waver there comes a bit more tricky to know which elements will mix with each other and use it to the fullest in certain situation, so I guess you could say it can be difficult, personally I really enjoy the class, gives tons of variety and playstyle, can be squishy
---
but if you smart you don't die a lot, I can survive on tiny hp and heal myself back, eevrything is practice and tbh just "feeling" the class.  
---
Personally I have hate relationship with ranger, extremely easy and boring class, with brainless pet - tanking and mostly using bow when leveling, I changed my opinion a bit after unlocking specializations, but still they seems pretty easy even druid-healer, as long as you remember the rotation it is not much "more" to do with it, by any means (some ranger fan may jump at me), the class can be fun with specializations but doesn't feel rewarding or hard (unless healing your party members and saving them is your personal goal to accomplish).   
---
For thief I don't have that many hour of him, but I would say it is in the middle class, ele the hardest, thief next, it is really rewarding if you kill sth or run away from danger due to stealth, specializations skills etc...

I guess it is also average to learn, can be hard, can be easier. I'm not the ebst person to give opinion about thief, but it is definitively interesting style especially if you go for more tricky weapons such as dagger , instead of easy dual pistols, or run specializations for example dare devil and start jumping like mad martial artists xD and yeah thiefs are not the best group content class, they don't bring much except for stealth, sometimes cc to groups, on contrary ele can bring high dmg or go more support build heal your folks or boon sharing and swap elements often to buff your team, when it comes to ele weapon I do agree with you, try maybe run sth less popular? I rarely run staff unless I really need long ranger or super aoe heal, depends what spec you will run after 80, but you can try dagger + sth else, as tempest I run dagger + warhorn feels so flexible, compared to scepter which feels so slow with some attacks,   
---
or run dagger + focus, , personally I feel lack of off hand weapons to mix especially in waver but even core ele feels a bit lacking.

Of course tryhards want the best builds and top numbers, but it doesn't mean they are forcing you into running that comp or builds and most don't try to force pug groups to do tryhard strats. At the end of the day   people need to not interpret the SC squad comps and benchmarks as the only thing that exists. I guess you have been unlucky when finding people to raid with.
---
i must question your mental state. 
---
I'm sure the posters think it's funny too, so it's not just for e-points. I just feel like this one is super low quality, since the "Elona" and "Elon Musk" mental association is something a lot of people probably made at some point without trying to meme. 
---
in today's episode of "is OP retarded?"
---
I am just here for the puns tbh
---
I FREAKING wish they came out with this! I remember reading something were I think NCsoft didn’t like it and people were saying it’s racist? But yeah I wish they came out with this! 
---
Howso, friendo
---
Thanks for the lengthy post.
---
I mean yeah, I'm all down for making it the best it can be. Especially when it comes to squad buffs and cleanses. My issue was that I felt like I just wasn't welcome eventho there is space. Could of just put me/other 'outcasts' into a seperate squad unless there's meta classes to fill the raid by which point I would see no reason to not kick me/others since it would make sense. 
---
It's just that way of being told you're not welcome, go switch or go roam. Like, you're playing your favourite class, learning it, building it, getting ascended gear/legendaries and then just being told that you can kindly f off rubs me the wrong way. 
---
Basically WvW is off the table, Raids and Fractals mean you have to play with a build thats optimal for highest dps your class can muster, which often times isn't your favourite weapon for instance, and sPvP..is well..just kinda there, you progress in game doesn't really matter in sPvP.
---
Which means you're only left with one thing...Fashion Wars and learning to play the harp songs.
---
Unfortunately at the moment I only want to play my necromancer to get good with the class
---
What makes you say that? Genuinely asking btw, not trying to sound condescending.
---
He seems like a fine lad who likes to invent things to improve the lives of ordinary people.
---
I was responding to the quantity of posts points. But its fair to say his annoyance might also lay with the the type of PvP content that does come through to the top. Parts of it is human nature, we find drama more attractive to engage with. It might even be that the amount of people with knowledge of PvP is too small to enjoy or understand the other types of posts, that is speculation though. My response about the quality posts was a bit quip.  
---
Just to see how bad it is now I went looking through 'New' for the last 24 hours. I found 3 posts about PvP, 2 of them where in the top 25(about 25 and 21) of posts in Hot. That seems pretty fair, that proves nothing though, its just a simple snapshot. 
---
&gt; Eyes of Kormir wich are used for nothing and are sold for nothing
---
Rune of the Firebrand (a lesser leadership rune), Pulsing Brandspark (for Harrier)
---
&gt;Leaf Fossils
---
Viper crafting
---
&gt;Barbed Thorns
---
Marauder crafting, Runes of the Berserker
---
These aren't useless.
---
Personally I think the WvW mount is good. Do I think it's a bit overpowered? Yes.
---
I think it should only really be used for faster travelling. If Anet removed the whole kill-downed-players thing, I wouldn't mind at all.
---
I think the original leap distance should come back once they've fixed all the exploitable areas, because that leap distance really does come in handy.
---
I also think that Anet should make it so that, when you're within range of a gate, all you have to do is press skill #3, and it automatically starts pulling at the gate - and if an enemy is attacking your mount while you're pulling at the gate, you could immediately disengage from the gate by turning away etc. - right now it's extremely frustrating to use on gates because it feels clunky and annoying to have to first attach the chain to the gate, then start tugging at it using skill #1, and if an enemy is on you, you have to first disengage from the gate using a particular skill, and then run. That's simply too annoying, and prevents people from wanting to use the mount on gates.
---
VG isn't a condition boss btw, it has low toughness so power is better, you just want ~2 condi to deal with red during split.
---
As for codi heavy fights (Mathias, Largos twins, Cairn, SH) Mirage is best DPS (there was a minor nerf but it shouldn't change much). Mainly it gets the highest damage on those bosses due to high confusion and torment (they all move and attack often). Renegade is another strong condi DPS that still provides confusion and torment. Berserker is also a great option especially if your group needs banners. Condition holo and weaver are options but I wouldn't recommend them since they have difficult rotations. Easy rotation but lower DPS would be condi soulbeast. Very easy rotation with decent DPS.
---
they started splitting up the skills like they already did in gw1 for years but decided to put them back together for whateve reason. 
---
if you want to have a proper balance splitting up pve and pvp/wvw is necessary, cause there is no way you balance fights against static 8m HP bosses the same way you balance dynamic pvp fights.
---
They should trash all the old Dungeons that have a broken code and replace them with new versions that have the same story, but with modern technologies and encounter design instead of adding Fractals and Raids for a while. This will give new players a better experience at the start of the game which results in them sticking around longer and this will also please veterans that for a long time have been asking for Dungeon revamps.
---
It's an investment for the future, one that is long overdue. 
---
No, no, no. The reason dungeons are fun is because they aren't 'modern'. If I wanted a sterilized instance that shoehorns you into arbitrary mechanics I'd do raids or fractals.
---
Dungeons are fun because of all the weird quirks and tricks you can do to beat things in fun an interesting ways. It's like the wild west, there are so many different ways to tackle them, pushing the game mechanics to their limits, and they are actually super rewarding as is, and more so if you master them.
---
Dungeons need to remain as they are. The only exception would be fixes to progress altering bugs, like Magg in CoF P2. 
---
No we did not. You just read it from your own selfish perspective, nothing more to it.
---
&gt; I don't get why you would make this a thing you have to unlock first
---
If it's not worth the effort to unlock it, then it's not worth anything at all. You had to unlock all of your skills, your weapons, etc. It's no different. Everything in PvP is handed to you in a bucket and PvP is generally a cesspool. I don't think those two facts are unrelated.
---
I feel this pain.... so much xD 
---
was f2p for 4 years 
---
I tried to say this last week and I was downvoted to hell. Guess people are coming around realizing it’s far too strong in some areas.
---
Increase the damage, reduce the durability, or increase the cooldowns.
---
&gt; My suggestion is 
---
Suggestions should be made in the official forums, not reddit.
---
Lol.... that was the argument people had, that they finally can enjoy wvw, becasue they can catch up xD. Now you come and whine, that you cant catch up \^\^"
---
This is really cool:-)

Some temporary mount rent would solve it
---
That is why I said inexperienced pugs :p
---
You have no idea how bad I want to go back to the jade sea. Cantha was my intro game into the series. Kurzick for life! 
---
While I frequent dungeons with friends for fun and nostalgia of doing speed clears, there are better and more profitable motivations to do other things in the game.  Once you unlock skins and complete collections that (if anyone cares for that is), running dungeons are a profit loss compared to other farms.
---
So while I agree, rewards aren't useless, the rewards are just not desirable. That's the reality of it.  
---
Im sorry scrapper is the highest skill cap in which game exactly???
---
Do you not recall the HoT launch????
---
Like hold on a sec there pre-hot, only a select few could actually play the triple kit engineer effectively and i emphasize EFFECTIVELY. Then HoT comes with scrapper and everyone and his mother could play scrapper well cus the spec is so mind numbingly easy to play and forgives you a heck ton for mistakes because it is innately tanky.
---
What you need to play scrapper at the highest level possible isn’t even scrapper knowledge , just general game knowledge can put you par to par with the best scrapper in game.
---
There's only 7 mounts. These Icons include the Skins for Mounts too. :)
---
He gets shit done.
---
Well I haven't really played dragonhunter spec tbh, I went thought all Hero points I needed to get firebrand spec and it was quite pleasant experience to play pof story, I don't remember struggling much,I died few times I think in first major camp in story (it was frustrating but slowly i beat that part) but that's about it and I had only berseker exotic gear with random trinkets, since I think back then I haven't got ascended one from s3 maps. Since you can have double weapon set, go always for sth defensive, like I remember having axe and focus / or sword and focus, for close combat defence, you can also run shield, but as I remember it has quite long cd, my alternative was running scepter main hand to immobilaze enemies which made it easier for me to land F1 skills from    
---
[Tome of Justice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Firebrand#Tome_of_Justice), also if you go for firebrand just use all your skills, I was using /rotating between books, like second one is healing and third defense, so if I felt hp dropped I was switching between them for self sustain and then attack again with book of justice aka book 1, I remember going from utlities skills for sth more aoe, like  
---
that burning circle, forgot the name, so for example you dodge enemies and try heal yourself then drop it on the ground to damage enemies in mid time, also dodge and don't check how many of your gear broke it can be frustrating just play, sometimes it takes longer but you will finish the story, but really personally I had a bit more issue playing mirage though pof since it still deal not enough dmg to make it fast sweep so my going though story was quite slow sometimes xD
---
For PvP?
---
I think Revenant, Thief, Guardian and Mesmers have very bursty kits if built for it.
---
Revenant is notorious for using as little as 2 skills to totally nuke someone's healthbar if they are out of dodges, and a Quickness Shackling Wave really melts people. 
---
Thieves are the only class in the game which can be counted as a true "1 shot" class due to the fact that they can stack a hideous amount of damage multipliers and power on themselves and slap someone with a Backstab and remove all their health. 
---
Unfortunately this sort of playstyle is very predictable and yu won't get alot of kills against experienced players who do not build full glass. 
---
Guardian, more accurately hammer guard, was very good at nuking unaware players with a combo, but I think the recent Righteous Instincts nerf might have tonned it down abit since they are missing a free 25% crit from before, which hurts their crit chance and messes with builds. 
---
Mesmers are the ones which those clones. Besides the fact that GS spam can deal alot of damage, the true threat is the clones primed to shatter on people once they are stacked with vulnerability and the mesmer has burnt yur dodges. Shatter builds are still popular and deal alot of damage on unsuspecting players and can easily delete people if they are caught by it. Though it is extremely telegraphed, fighting a Mesmer, more specifically a Mirage, is a major headache due to the amount of evades and general mesmer shenanigans they like to pull. 
---
Most pugs don't hit anywhere near 80% of the benchmark
---
Can relate.
---
The price is not the problem. The problem is what you get for that price.
---
I wouldn't mind spending 50€ in gems if I get that value back, and I'd wager I'm far from alone here. But what do I get for those 4000 gems? Mostly overpriced crap, RNG honeypots, and bundles full of things no one wants.
---
It's been like this since pretty much 2012. I started collecting gem store minis, but then got burnt out during Tequatl Rising and Super Adventure Box: Back to School, for the insane amount of crappy minis they were constantly releasing, more and more expensive each time. They killed the collectionist in me back then, and it's only gotten worse and worse, to the point I just stopped caring about two of their main sources of revenue (glider and mount skins).
---
I don't expect them to change after so many years, but god do I wish they did. And I haven't even gotten into how worse it gets when you realize the gem store is directly connected to the scarcity of skins you can earn by playing the game.
---
*Sweet Summer Child.*
---
dungeons are f2p core gw2 content = anet wont get money for spending resources on them anymore
---
Power Warrior Bannerslave does respectable DPS. It *should* be a far cry behind the other DPS classes, but it's respectable. On golems I can normally get about 24-25K DPS on Power Warrior BS, compared to my Dragonhunter where I hit around 31K. In theory I believe Warrior benchmarks around 26K, and DH should benchmark at like 35Kish.
---
However the main reason for bringing Power Warrior (outside of the fact that condition damage is just really bad on some fights like Samarog and Keep Construct) is the *massive* amount of CC it brings. Power Warrior can obliterate breakbars, which is a huge help to the team.
---
Condition Berserker Bannerslave though, when running the Discipline traitline instead of Tactics, *that's* where the damage is at. In theory it benchmarks at like 34K DPS, right up there with DH. I'm not perfect at it, but I think I normally reach around 30K with it myself. It's a really strong build. You don't have very much CC, but, it's great DPS.
---
You'll never catch a good Mirage. But, I've beaten mediocre/bad Mirages plenty of times with my Condi BS. : ). It does very, very good DPS.
---
See, it could be worse. Instead of not releasing new-faces, they could give us this...
---
Mesmer's portal
---
As roamer i disagree. Mounts are really useful for players who dont wanna fight 1v1 . They can go back to blob and not be spawn camped. Few issues are there but will be solved. Plus it helps classes that were not so useful for roaming to be more mobile.
---
nice try EA
---
I'm with ya. I'd be willing to bet a lot of the people complaining about Mirage haven't given it a go.
---
I do happen to agree that confusion needs to be toned down, which will bring Mirage back in line. Hitting in the 40's while most classes are happy to be at 32-33 is a *little* high. I'd be ok if Mirage were like, 5-10% higher than every other condi class, but, they are a bit stand out right now.
---
That said, I've tried picking it up this week since ANet apparently isn't gonna nerf it. I've changed my tune, a little. It's definitely trickier than I thought.
---
Even worse, their whole business models depends on whales, which is all fine and dandy while those whales are happy, but the moment you lose one (if not a few), the impact of that loss will be huge on your finances.
---
They're running a mainstream service with the business model of a gourmet restaurant.
---
This, it trivializes a lot of things
---
Big miss there. In my opinion, a pack like this would have been far better if it had offered these five options instead:
---
* Normal skin with four dye channels.
---
* Normal skin with four dye channels and a guild banner.
---
* Fire effect.
---
* Frost effect.
---
* Tiger skin.
---
And make it 1600 gems, not 2000.
---
Ele and Thief both have a high skill ceiling tbh.  Plenty of people have outlined the play style of ele so I'll stay away from that here and talk about the other one.  Thief may seem simplistic, and in truth it has a relatively low barrier for entry.  The truth is there is a very high skill ceiling, making the difference between a truly skilled thief player and a newer thief player look like night and day.  There are lots of little tricks and tips for making your thief perform at a top level, with things like weapon stow cancels, shadow step cancels and precision timing on skill chaining making for some challenging gameplay if you're willing to invest in to it.  Ele definitely has a lot to keep track of, having many skills and their cooldowns invisible to you, which makes it challenging to play well... but thief rewards highly skilled play rather than just rewarding memorization and your ability to count.  Fwiw, I am clearly biased.  For any of these classes, I recommend watching videos from top players of those classes before making a decision.
---
&gt; I'm trying to have some fun and relax with my favourite class 
---
I get it, man. I have a ranger in full ascended too. It's super fun to play, but I understand that it doesn't contribute much in zerg fights. I bring my tempest/scourge to zergs/raids and I play my ranger with my buddies doing small scale stuff. There's a time and place for every class, and the ranger's ideal situation usually just isn't within the confines of a zerg.
---
Gear up an alt or two. It might help you enjoy WvW more.
---
Why, lol? These do not contain RNG in any way whatsoever.
---
Guess they just gave up altogether.
---
Perhaps boost the alternatives more than nerf the skills. That's a fair point. For things like Signet of Inspiration, though, it got to the point where the whole raid meta was built around one signet and one trait and everything else just had to slot in around it. That is a very extreme example, though, even if Anet did take ten thousand years to address it. 
---
Anyway, this whole thing is meant to be in fun so whatever works. 
---
It isn't exactly a fair comparison with MMOs such as WoW because they are better designed for raid diversity (actually having multiple viable tanking and healing specs) and having variable difficulties, gear progression and different break points means that those DPS rankings can shift quite a bit. Throw in a commitment that is greater than an hour and a half for hero points and digging out some surplus ascended gear and people actually have mains beyond preference.
---
Guild Wars 2 encourages alts far more so the expectation isn't that you roll up to Largos Twins with your beloved condi Weaver but instead switch to the utterly broken DPS for that boss. In other MMOs, due to their structure, sub optimal DPS isn't seen as such a large issue for the vast majority of groups. 
---
I think i will finish my Guardian and then try out the Thieves. Thx man.
---
And with a name like death_witch, who could possibly have expected something that malign? 
---
Impressive.
---
Can any class snipe people? 
---
Condi Scrapper non melee says hi.
---
And works perfectly.
---
Seems you can't Improvise. Adapt. Overcome
---
&gt;I didn't say it was p2w.
---
Considering the game's endgame is based on horizontal progression and cosmetics, and most of them are obtained exclusively through the gem store, I'd say it can be easily considered as that.
---
Technically that gives people less to work on, and at its worst could change player behaviour. Why [insert a subject of a bonus weekend] during the week if you can wait for the next bonus weekend and get away with half the work? Why play the content you actually enjoy, if something else benefits you significantly more? Or worse yet, what if you can't play the content you love because a bonus event pulls too many players elsewhere?
---
Artificial incentive is tricky and dangerous. STO uses tons of it, it's a little annoying but understandable considering the tiny size of the player population. I feel that GW2 is working pretty well as it is. They could maybe look into increasing the difficulty of specific events during specific hours on specific weekends, but this game hardly needs to be made any easier.
---
It is held by awakened and has lots of bones and stuff when you go to take the guild hall so yeah I duno what the guild hall rep guy is smoking lol
---
But did you craft a legendary and do map completion?
---
touche
---
Deadeye elite spec on thief, yes. Literally a sniper. Or Ranger.. Or Ele..
---
Don't delete it please. It doesn't matter what your motivations were (and i'm 99.9% sure it wasn't just for the karma) the important thing is that you made content that at the time of writing has been appreciated by 70 people.
---
As someone who dreams of it one day but taken a casual break from AP ... HO DAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMN Bruh.
---
+1 AP
---
You said yourself that you got through queue, which means you are already taking spots away, albeit from map not squad.
---
What? 
---
Just do Triumphant armor reward track 6 times and a full set of minstrel exotic gear if crafting is too expensive.  Nothing can beat Minstrel.
---
I think my point still stands on yes people can switch to a more optimized dps for that fight but if the person is saying they are on shotting and there are no qualms with his choice of dps, is there really an issue? Does it really warrant another poster to call others selfish and criticize his play? There isn't that huge of a difference in dps where people are attacked is there? 
---
And I'm saying this all in the realm of possible dps specs that are performing and "viable" but not necessarily top zomg broken dps. Which I thought the original commenter was implying when he said middle of pack dps.
---
You hit the nail on the head there! Many of the guild don't play guild wars much these days... but we never miss a raid night :D
---
I have 20 characters with core map completion, and 7+5 legendary weapons (also 3+3 legendary armors).

I definitely understand that. I've had work done for me before and not known what price I should be asking for XD good luck! You'll do great!

&gt; Everything in PvP is handed to you in a bucket and PvP is generally a cesspool. I don't think those two facts are unrelated.

Everything is also handed to you in DOTA, LoL, and Counter-Strike, not to mention Starcraft and warcraft. Those games are literally the definition of video game PVP.   
---
I guess those two facts are unrelated after all. How about we blame the real reason for GW2 PVP shortcomings - inane class design, combat system, and poor balance? 
---
Yaaaaay ! Gratz, you did very hard work :)

Sad that it’s not possible to get even 25k+ AP if you’ve missed core addon with its weeklies and LS1 :(

RITE OF THE GREAT DWARF FFS!

That's rather cohesive and the visual cancer has been kept to manageable levels. I'll give you +1 internet points.
---
Well, I'm totally on the opposite side. In fact, I would love if PvP let us swap our characters on the fly, in the middle of the game.
---
Many competitive PvP games already allow this, and it would help balance quite a bit, specially with those matches where team composition dictates the winner from minute zero.

Forgive my Rev pleb-ness XD Its one of my least-played classes even as a self-proclaimed multiclasser

Yes, games renowned worldwide for their friendly communities.

Ah true, but apart from the 1 trait that affects bleeding, the entirety of the Guardian Traits affect burning and no other condi. I use bleeding as an extra condi like free extra damage in PVE and as an extra condi to cleanse in competitive, but never build a guardian considering the bleeding.

I had to stop watching so I wouldn't scream at my computer.

Yeah, true. I was just pointing out that getting kicked from the squad *doesn't* always mean they don't want you *around*. An extra warm body that's not sapping their boons is rarely a bad thing unless you're making swords appear or being a rally bot.

because they DIDN'T care until a few days ago when the mount was added to their game mode of choice? how thick are you?
---
let's do a little exercise: assume there is billy and he only plays wvw and probably only has the raptor in pve or something and didn't bother to keybind it? now suddenly there is this mount in wvw that gives a pretty strong advantage so naturally billy gets it, but didn't read through the entire gw2 subreddit to find out about this bug

so damn short-sighted too! "how can people do x when i don't do/enjoy it?" big brains man

are you aware that some people click all their skills? many of them too! how is that even possible??? can you imagine? ugh

Stealth was fucking great back in Planetside in 2003. Tons of unique gameplay and very fair balance (good luck with that tiny ass inventory that could only hold the hack tool, two ACEs, and a bunch of pistol ammo).

Stealth sucks ass (for non-stealthers that is) in every modern game because it comes with no real drawbacks, while offering ridiculous utility.

I woulf be a cow-ard not to upvote that comment

The real issue is that confusion is broken compared to other conditions and as long as this issue doesn't get fixed, balancing condition dps will be a nightmare. And yes, it's frustrating that mirage is as broken.

I do think out of all classes the Spellbreaker is one of the last of squads left, and they last longer when caught out of place and the fact that the bubble elite skill now moves with them makes me playing my FB or herald a pain.... altho i don't know besides the fact that they have a good elit and the longest death delay if they are any good for your group. So what if you are the last one left and tanky, there is so many aoe's and long range skills everyone will die around you, leaving you to slowly die alone... but yea as far as staying with your group and lasting into they die, FB and Scrapper all the way.  Alittle behind is herald because they are tanky as hell to, but they don't really relieve pressure on your team unless you do enough damage to make enemies back off some. (Spellbreaker)= last alive with battle swinging ult on a long cd.... (Firebrand)=upkeep of group with good stability/retaliation/heals&lt;btw retaliation buffs given if hit count as you hitting enemy = more bags&gt;....(Scrapper)=nonstop medium heals and cleanse for days = Buff because Eng skills.... Herald= group wide offensive buffs and aoe dps pressure= bags

This one is the best so far, imo.

Edge of the Mists is relevant again.

Hehe
---
How've you got it built? I'm genuinely interested, I'd love to know how other ranged scrappers are adapting.
---
Nice try, but you simply can't break 6 stuns timed really well in a row with 2 stun breaks.  Being good means nothing when you can't move or defend yourself.

Every day this is posted. Yours is the most low effort. I am sorry but I am going to down vote this thread and by doing so I hope I did not hurt your feelings but I do not want to see this thread on the homepage because if I did it’s make the sub look so low effort and that’s really bad for all the new players that first come to this sub to see what the game is all about.
---
Again, that is selfish of you in assuming that everyone else wants to play like you. It IS an NBA League for many players. Those professional commanders that kick you out of their squads spend their personal time theory crafting and working out what class compilation works best for how they play. They test gear sets and runes and weapons and actually enjoy finding what works and what doesn't, and then want to play with what is most optimal.

They play purely for the WvW content and take it seriously, because like any hobby or recreational activity, you want to enjoy it and you want to see results for your time. It might be relaxing for you to chill on your ranger in the protection of a large gtoup, but that group has spent the time and effot in leveling and gearing what is considered a meta class, and they don't go to that effort just to carry players who refuse to make the effort. 
---
If you genuinely want to play WvW for the large-scale group play, there are often pug groups that allow any class and you can just follow them to your hearts content. But if you are upset because the good groups won't carry you, the serious meta squads that are always winning, then you will level and gear a class that can contribute to that. Otherwise you can roam on your ranger which is what they are good for, or command your own squad. 
---
Ultimately, your post isn't providing anything constructive. You've told us that it hurts your feelings being kicked from squads on your ranger, but you haven't provided any viable solutions worth discussing. 
---
Finally... Can I have his  dressing-gown though?
---
Soulbeast is the most effective at it.
---
Yeah, but that's a ton more work, tho.
---
Mirage is not Broken on LT at all. It performs well, but it's hardly broken. Just because the community seems addicted to whatever snowcrows say, doesn't mean it isn't perfectly doable with any condi class. We often have a couple of necros and if anything do better because of the barrier.
---
it's going from season 4 to season 5 without an expac. No idea why, but unless they shake up their LW formula it's probably gonna hurt the game a lot
---
Yeah i miss Zojja too.
---
Nice :)  I came close to one, still have all the parts sitting in my bank, with the exception of the precursor. In the end, the precursor to bifrost was just too expensive to keep putting gold into it. Never was much of a farmer, think the most gold I ever had was around 400. 
---
They need to add a new bounty named Elon Husk to the game that wanders the Elon river. It could be a husk form of Choya.
---
For that I'll address that they made every single Gyro a combo field that follows you, including the elite and the heal skill (just not shredder because that's the combo finisher.)  Your rifle has multiple combo finishers on it, let alone whatever kits you may use!

Try popping your \[Jump Shot\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jump\_Shot](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jump_Shot)) in your \[Bulwark Gyro\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bulwark\_Gyro](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bulwark_Gyro)) for a pulsing barrier that Dazes your target and grants Superspeed with the \[Shocking Speed\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shocking\_Speed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shocking_Speed)) trait, using \[Defense Field\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defense\_Field](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defense_Field)) to give yourself Stability before using \[Overcharged Shot\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Overcharged\_Shot](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Overcharged_Shot)) to knock them back but be immune to it yourself.  Have some fun with it!  Anet didn't forget about you!
---
The two are not compatible.
---
Power chrono does not have any burst, it ramps up like a condi class due to how phantasms and chronophantasma the trait in chronomancer works.

---
I mean, that's true. Fair enough.
---
I'm still to this day wishing Engie would get Weapon Swap, which would massively mitigate the salt I have, lol
---
When we have bonus weekend and boosters in effect, ~5 hours is a relevant estimation.
---
Flat-footed with no bonus or boosters, yes, pure math will show 195 per 5 minutes will take about 8 hours.
---
Besides Winter's pressence what else gives that frosty aura?
---
Reddit is not about validity, it's about mob mentality.

If it's not a volatile topic, then they're angry.

I also have [Chalice of the Gods](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chalice_of_the_Gods) in my weapon swap because that frosty trail is amazing =D
---
Ahah Nice!
---
The OP is talking about raids here though, and mirage performs exceptional against some raid bosses like LT because of confusion and their attack. 
---
As for pvp meta changed a lot since the introduction of PoF because nearly every class saw power creep, want to talk about boonbeast, scourge or fb? Mirage performs well mostly in soloq when teams are not that coordinated, in ATs standard and best team comp would be scourge and fb for sure followed by boonbeast, rev and thief. 
---
mirage has seen nerf every patch, even the dodge you mention has been nerfed in duration this patch, what is crazy is some people never learn to improve, would rather keep on attacking while having confusion, and still keep blaming how easily they die.
---
It'd be great if they had a daily bonus rotation primarily only during festivals.  
---
People need a reason to leave SAB, Labyrinth once in a while.
---
I wouldn’t consider myself a hardcore PvP’er but I dabble most seasons, and I too agree with this. 
---
Well you still buy the mats.
---
List is above! =]  Pharus, Kamohoali'i, and Guardian Elite Signet for that 'underglow.'
---
Congrats. I've only made 2 gen 2 legendaries. Astralaria and Nevermore. Astrlaria is by far my favorite of all, I kinda regret making Nevermore though - should've made Bifrost
