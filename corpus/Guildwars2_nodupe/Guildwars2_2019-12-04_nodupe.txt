This^

---
---
&gt; due to these practices
---

---
How exactly do you expect them to generate sustained income then?
---
They have no subscription.
---
They give away the episodes for free.
---
They sell no power, but only convenience and cosmetics, in the shop.
---
They give you free versions of most items, and usually have some in the challenging content as rewards (raids, or whatever).
---
Genuinely curious how you expect them to generate revenue, over the long term.
---
It’s been like that for years.
---
henge.  if you dont do it know, you will want to die later.
---
Because^
---
you could've done this before by swapping it from your inventory while out of combat, right? or did you lose the buff when you unequipped the weapon with the relevant sigil??
---
Stop cheating.
---
&gt; How about straight selling cosmetics instead of predatory loot boxes and stop selling basic features from the first game.
---
But the new cape is a straight cosmetic.
---
You are changing the topic, and bringing in your anger over other areas of the game into this issue.
---
To be clear, no. What you want is customization.  Dynamic responds to conditions other than sheer user input.
---
Wish I could upvote this more, it's incredible the ways people will justify avoiding learning and improving at the game.
---
&gt; wasn't meant to be a "casual" game 
---
Development = design. When there was no clear end-game/goals first three years, then it was clearly made to be casual. Furthermore, dungeons were never updated with new rewards other than TA-aether which was a big failure. Legendary weapons were not even advertised until HoT and legendary crafting came about.
---
Getting many thousands of gems in gw2 has never cost me a cent of real world money.  Gold isn't hard to make, and they let me get everything with it.  Come back to me when that is an option in PoE.  Warframe literally sells non-cosmetics as their standard fare.  Actual weapons and frames.  The ability to upgrade those weapons and frames.  If GW2 did that, I finally would quit playing.  You really are using basically the worst two examples of a cash shop to be like "They should do it like this."
---
Cheer up :V
---
This is just pure eyeshore. Holy shit they are unable to even make adjustments to the UI let alone even try to overhaul it.
---
I mean why is it even bad. Firtly, it's open world... secondly why can i faceroll my keyboard on full glass reaper, and kill everything but on my glass weaver im really weak. And in open world, reapers burst is better also. Imo a small buff like this is nice. Might run the toughness stacking sigil.
---
I normally have the d3d9.dll inside the bin64 folder. Sometimes it needs to be inside, sometimes outside, sometimes either works.
---
stripper wars 2
---
Male Norn Strippers.
---
So what?
---
How about you pay for content they create, and don't expect free stuff.
---
If it's getting new content then it's not in maintenance mode. It might not be developing at its peak pace, but. . . ok, I guess some of ya'll need the actual definition here, "maintenance  mode" is the point in a game's lifespan in which there is NO further development on the game, and all staff is limited to *maintaining* the status quo. This means keeping the servers running, customer support, infrastructure patches to address changes to the software environment, etc., to just allow the game to continue running as-is. 
---
It does **not** mean "the game continues to be developed, at roughly the same pace it always has been, but in a direction that I do not like."
---
It doesn’t sound like you’re interested in fractals much, so stacking high AR will mostly be useless for you. The 2-3% is nothing to laugh at, especially to flex on your friends your dps, and is basically the last thing you need in terms of completing gear, so I think it’s a worthy investment. I would just get full +5 power/+5 ar infusions or WvW infusions if that’s your thing and use that pretty much everywhere. Swap in your 150 ar when you want to dip into fractals since you have legendary gear and youre good. Would also highly recommend swapping to power dps chrono for fractals as support chrono is kinda eh in fractals.
---
Alas, nothing was done about it. Not even letting us hide ALL our armor.
---
&gt;Yeah, you're happy about other gamemodes not having players, not getting support, bugfixes or attention because everything must be for and about you.
---
I'm happy about gamemodes that never had enough player engagement being reduced in priority, so that limited resources can be spent on building content that will be enjoyed by more people. It is better for the game that they minimize effort on the content that is not being played, in favor of the content that most players enjoy. You should agree on that. 
---
The issue is that players who do not agree with that keep shouting that the sky is falling, which is creating a toxic atmosphere around here. They need to either embrace GW2 as an open world PvE game, or just accept that it's not the game they want it to be and move on. It benefits no one for them to troll the forum with "game is dying" talk just because the game is no longer what they want it to be.
---
Not in the notes but they are fixed. Did them after patch and they did not reset with daily reset just now
---
::thinknoose:: emoji
---
True...
---
I wouldn't classify this as a legendary, sure, it's a very good looking dagger. But it's missing a few things for a legendary. Compare to the claw or even incinerator you can tell it's missing a lot to be a legendary, it's fairly comparable to other gemstore skins to be honest.
---
&gt;Low viewership/attention can at times be indicative of the state of a game.
---
Depends entirely on the game. If the game is a very "watch friendly" game that has traditionally high Twitch viewership, then lower viewership could indicate reduced interest. If, on the other hand, the game is more designed to be played than to be watched, and never really appealed to passive audiences, then Twitch viewership is pretty irrelevant. 
---
Free advertising is fine and all, but if you have to spend resources to make yourself "more streamable," then it's no longer free advertising. 
---
Also, casual Twitch streamers are less likely to jump into a game like GW2 because it is a huge investment of time and energy to reach endgame content (unless they just buy their way to an established account). They're more likely to just jump into some competitive multiplayer shooter or something, where their existing skills are all they need to become "interesting" overnight.
---
That's what I thought. You can basically get all these things in game already. Hmm
---
Overpriced
---
What you mean the paid tourneys? I was there. I played them in a PvP server which was Anvil Rock. Do I need to remind you that it was a failed system, and that the system was thrown out within development? Pro-competition was never really there. Even when there was 'pro-competition' it was very low population. It did not exist in a major sense. It was there, and that was it. There was not any developer communication with the PvP community as far as I know which was very unlike PvE.
---
This
---
I didn't actually say they weren't replaced.
---
As a friend who is familiar with the situation, I absolutely believe this was a wrongful ban and a very harsh punishment for the situation. I've never personally heard of "map breaking" being a bannable offense and I understand that's really up to Arenanet to decide upon, but a 3 month ban AND being accused of cheating/using third party programs to gain some sort of advantage seems very unreasonable and I will absolutely stand with mesmerasura on this.  
---
I really hope Arenanet sees this and investigates further/reconsiders this punishment.
---
I think it's about time anet should implement their own DPS meter.
---
I've always said, popular mods are a clear indication of what the game actually needs and the developers should looking into creating their own stable version if they dont wish for players to mod the game because of account safety or cheating reasons.
---
There is nothing that say that we wont have more both in game and in gemstore in the future. So claiming that there will only be one in game ever is kind of a talking out of your arse statement.
---
3 months is way too long to ban someone over something like this
---
I'm guessing it stings especially hard knowing you thought that they would never do you wrong since you are such loyal player for 7 years.
---
This reminds me of recent Fallout76 bans where they banned players who morally did no wrong and invested incredible amount of time and effort into game and its improvement, yet they got slapped with banhammer.
---
Good luck lifting ban, and to Anet; this kind of thing can undo thousands of dollars worth of marketing and customer loyalty, and it is such easily mended or avoided little thing. If only Anet cared as much as proper dev should.
---
Well, since ArenaNet is a business, I suppose it should be whatever yields the most revenue. Unless you are against free market capitalism, of course.
---
I rather it be this than chairs..
---
Not good at all, considering how big the game is. But who cares, I don't know why I'd ever watch a guild wars stream instead of playing it myself. Neither do I know why so many people watch streamers play wow. Well I follow multiple dwarf fortress streamers, so I probably shouldn't talk :p
---
Were you just doing the thing where you use the dismount leap during a jackal teleport to abuse the teleport momentum in the dismount animation? If so I do (did, before I quit) that constantly. There's no way this is a justified ban assuming your story is true and isn't omitting anything meaningful.
---
Seems pretty steep, especially when more than half of the game wasn't originally designed with mounts in mind and is pretty easy to break out of or fall through now.
---
You could always do that anyways. When zoomed in all the way on the minimap and setting the size as small as possible, you only see things in your immediate vicinity, like the waypoint you are 20 feet from and can see/hear next to you.
---
After reading your first paragraph, I thought about how cheap is the excuse you are using, but after seeing your gallery and continue reading you I believe in you, hope Anet unban you.
---
It's very noticeable at night depending on color and brightness.
---
Ranger longbow is one of the strongest weapons in the whole game. 
---
It even does really good DPS now in instanced PvE content with the Barrage buff.
---
Sounds like a rightful ban
---
Why is Scarlet in the Living World panel for Central Tyria?
---
Could it be...?
---
&gt; But who cares, I don't know why I'd ever watch a guild wars stream instead of playing it myself. 
---
Exactly!
---
Really? You seem to be shitting a lot on it. Today there is ONE in the gemstore and ONE that you can get in game. It is very likely there will be more in future. 
---
And add to that, the gem store skins is by far less then the skins yo ucan get from the game over all. It is a HUGE difference.  
---
And some how people seem to be happy in game. Even in WvW today people running around with them both so i guess people are not that unhappy as you feel they should be.
---
Yeah let me pay 200e for template unlocks. Good content.
---
Yeah, this isn't right. Please unban this player's account.
---
I talk through my mouth. Only poop comes out of my arse.
---
I really don't think a 3 month ban is fair at all in this situation.
---
I remember a dev a while back saying map breaking was fine, just as long as it wasn't being used to some advantage.  Although I believe this dev deleted their reddit account.
---
Ok well that's the thing, it didn't even say "Living World" i was just giving you the benefit of the doubt.  All it says is in the linked screenshot is "Central Tyria"
---
So ok, Orr metas, RIBA and sandstorm don't have anything to do with "living world" but that's probably what the slot in LFG will be used for.  I didn't build it.
---
nope. that jackal trick doesn't apply to wvw and I don't use the wvw mount to break anything.  I've only ever broke out of PVE zones and never to gain any advantage. Just to take cool screenshots and videos.
---
Have shown what? Actually i am going to call out bs even. Because the fact is this. And i don't have the up to today numbers but about a month back i checked it. There are 5300 skins (probably a bit more now) that you can get through playing the game. And there are about 500 gemstore skins (probably a bit more now) that you can get from the gemstore. 
---
So with that in mind exactly were do you feel the game have showeds us what you claim?
---
If I were you, I'd move on to another game. It seems it'll take more than 3 months to have them give you the data, maybe only with court action.
---
Also, to any Anet employee that might read this: I've been here only for some months, but I'm already reluctant to invest any more in the game, and I don't recommend it to my friends.
---
Bravo! Something solid and not just a low tier meme or single sentence. Thank you OP.
---
I'll hope, but not expect, that we eventually get dyable versions of some of the old items... even if only the ones you can currently dye as gliders.
---
I think you are missing a lot of information to your argument.
---
You say that they added new gameplay modes?
---
For PvP, they only added stronghold. The whole entire pvp community criticized them, and constructive criticism to improve it was ignored by Anet. 
---
I'm not sure how you think they provided resources when they put out the map and did not patch it yet. It has been out for years with no improvements. The community only hated it because it was truly unfinished and not worked upon.
---
"Youd do even more on a better class" Then why am I top dps and not you, mr. Thief? 
---
Yep, such is the story of the humble necro trying to get by. 
---
Ive played a bit of mesmer and personally dislike the playstyle, but I've nothing against them at all. Great class, just not for me.
---
Condi mm is slow yeah. Definitely a class of patience, same with trailblazer scourge, but they're truly unkillable. Trailblazer scourge may be one of if not the hardest to kill class even in 1v1, if built correctly. That is, last time I played it it was. No doubt its much worse.after the dumb scpurge changes... Hate em.
---
its anet. they dont care and wont do anything
---
It would be nice to have some sort of postmortem on features like that, to see what the internal deliberations were like leading up to and after it came out, but my assumption is that they considered the feedback, evaluated the costs of implementing it verses the potential gains, and just decided that it wasn't worth the effort because even if they totally nailed it, interest would not be high enough to justify it. I think they made the right call, in retrospect.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/68lpga/is_there_any_tool_that_shows_enemy_boobs_in_a/
---
You will get downvoted to hell by the “Fuck Anet” brigade. Though what they banned him for (allegedly, because I don’t take some asshat’s complaining on Reddit as the actual situation) wasn’t the real issue, he also admitted to breaking out of maps and using exploits. 
---
So...enjoy the break bud.
---
So *that's* how I accidentally fell through Bjora Marches. I was just trying to tag a champion in time lmao
---
As someone in mesmerasura's guild, I just want to say that their screenshots and videos and the absolutely mindblowing creations in our guild hall are some of the most enjoyable things to come out of this game for me. Their joy for this game is readily apparent and I find it absolutely heartbreaking that they've been suspended for merely pushing the limits of the game with nothing but pure intentions.
---
Should we unban everyone who pleads a case like this? Just like the last "I'm innocent!" Thread which was shut down by a dev (which was a justifiable ban, FYI) my bets are on it being legit.
---
i didn't say there weren't any assholes. i was just replying to the comment that seemed to say that anyone who doesn't help some random is an asshole.
---
Nice. Only need to look when something new is added.
---
White knighting for Anet... careful you might get banned in game since they don't have anymore devs to fire
---
Strangely accurate for some people xD.
---
&gt;Pre-HoT was pure casual; therefore, it could not have been the concept to be as such.
---
You've changed your argument. Originally you were saying it never could have been the concept. Now you're saying it wasn't the result. Of course my argument isn't going to make sense when you aren't comparing it to what was actually being debated.
---
&gt;both time investment and difficulty was casual level rather than what devs wanted
---
Dungeons were actually regarded as incredibly difficult on release, with many and frequent calls for them to be nerfed. As I said, they got easier than intended over time as players got more used to the combat. Then, after the community got used to that, there was pushback any time they tried to add anything difficult, and it would end up getting nerfed. They found the casual (in terms of difficulty) niche on accident.
---
I think they made this map easy for players to get into the new season content before it starts to scale in difficulty again.. it’ll be a while before we reach Jormag and I can see it getting harder which I’m very excited about. 
---
I hope Jormag is super difficult to kill
---
Was that the rule? 
---
I don't remember us voting on that. 
---
I thought power was a no go for cash, but everything else was fair game?
---
In fact until recently, quality of life was never mentioned - it was always cosmetics and power.
---
As is always the case, vote with your wallet and don't buy - it's what I'm doing.
---
Is anyone else getting this error constantly?
---
Unable to complete the operation (permission denied). (Code=49:58:0:0:101)
---
I have no idea what it actually is but it seems to keep coming up after I teleport to a waypoint or exit a scout map viewing etc.
---
Yes.
---
Maybe because the UI collapses again every time it is opened.
---
It seems to be affecting accounts that have PoF but never bought HoT.. at least for one of mine it is..
---
[This is all I need to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dka7hc/megathread_october_2019_ban_wave/f4lgjva/)
---
Most bans are going to be accurate even if a company is completely incompetent. There's not really any need to point that out. The problem is that, unlike ArenaNet, the players have no other recourse if they actually are falsely banned. Most of the time they won't even double check the ban. That's why you'll see people giving these posts the benefit of the doubt, even if it's not true most of the time.
---
I find it interesting that Anet can and will use the "3rd party program" excuse as a generic catch-all, without ever having to justify a suspension because the User Agreement gives them full right to do whatever they want to any player.
---
And in the event that this suspension ends up being a mistake, Anet will never offer any sort of "I'm sorry" package for missing out on playing the game while a player appeals.  You just get an "Opps, we fuck up, but your account will forever be marked with a flag that you got suspended, so don't do anything again or it'll be permanent next time around."
---
yep.. started today.. but only capes so far.
---
It's also worth noting that there would be a bunch of legitimate bans if they actually added a new way to detect 3rd party programs.
---
&gt; Black Lion Industry Board
---
So if this works like the Hunter's Board does that mean Tier 6 mats as well? And if so wouldn't that take a chunk out of the usefulness of the home instance nodes? I get that you'd effectively be getting double in those cases but that would seriously cut into some of the reasons people have to even open BLC's, unless this is a precursor to removing them before legislation rolls along.
---
That's fair.  In my experience these take a while to get any real, actionable information.  A couple of weeks usually.  That's sluggish and maybe unacceptable but it's also a different conversation.  Just trying to point out that we shouldn't all automatically be picking either a "UNBAN HIM NOW!1!!1" or a "Good, you SHOULD BE BANNED FOREVER!1!!1" stance because we know next to nothing except what one person has said happened.
---
I think we have dozens of them nowadays.

Just like all the mount skins you can earn in-game!
---
GW2 support doesn't really exist to review the case. I doubt most of them even have the tools to. It's literally just telling you what they think you did wrong. The only point of arguing with them is to get it escalated to somebody who actually can do something about it.
---
Alternatively, don't use unf and you won't get banned.
---
yes but that's how every other class have to live with  
---
( only engineer as exception )
---
What about: Fully rendered 3d voxel graphics
---
Agreed. I'm going to miss flinging myself off cliffs and bellyflopping a poor victim below. Now I'm going to fling myself off a cliff (out of habit) and just *die*. :(
---
And then they spammed Reddit.
---
&gt;That is the normal and desired reaction but sadly not the one you’ll always get. Some people are assholes.
---
He responded to someone saying  "  If you tell them that you're having trouble due to a physical  disability and ask for help, empathy will take over and they'll be more  likely to be helpful and caring. "  
---
"Helpful and caring" doesn't always mean taking away from your time.  Sometimes it means pausing for a moment and directing them to help, or just showing basic understanding for their situation.  It seems like you were extrapolating what you wanted to hear as a negative and projected it on to the conversation in a way that was dismissive of the idea that some people can be assholes.
---
Wheee! Now I can finally wear a pair of angel wings like everyone else!
---
Collision detection in GW2 is pretty wonky so if you got too fast shit like that happens. It's also possible to do this with pulls/knockbacks as seen multiple times during PvP matches.
---
What makes you say that they review the ban most times? Many false ban waves that get upvoted to the top of the subreddit could have been fixed easily if they'd bothered to double check. That's why reddit is able to figure it out even without being given much information. The only times it gets double checked is if you can get someone higher up involved (like Dornsinger in the thread you linked). People don't forget about the people who lie. They just know that ArenaNet makes a lot of mistakes in this area, so they'd rather give the benefit of the doubt to the player.
---
Aww, thanks so much! That means a lot &lt;3
---
same!! i wish they kept this aspect, it doesn’t need to reduce fall damage
---
Look at the top left of the screen. This black border used to all around the screen. Maybe it has to do something with it.
---
How much of GW2 is free? Can I play a good while and have a good experience without purchasing? Thank you!
---
:D
---
I think you're really underselling how much useful information the minimap provides, but I respect your opinion. I'm more surprised that people on *reddit* apparently so desperately want it. Reddit tends to draw the type of player that maximizes their use of every available piece of information, to more efficiently play the game.
---
The chances of playing with those groups are so low that they're almost not worth mentioning unless you know people that run them to begin with and have hundreds of essences.
---
pretty sure a dev once said map breaking is fine, dumb ban reason
---
did you read the post that I linked? it's identical to this one, so was the last one, and the one before that. know what they had in common outside of this one? it was a legit ban. it's very possible this was a false positive, i honestly hope so but the odds are not in their favor.
---
The core game which released in 2012 is free.  You can reach the max level the game has to offer (80), play all the base dungeons, progress a decent ways in the Fractals that were added post-release, and participate in PvP and World vs. World competitive content, though your character will lack some options (usually powerful ones) added in expansions.
---
Restrictions on free to play accounts limit how many characters you can create, your inventory size, what items you can buy and sell on the in-game Trading Post, and your ability to engage in certain in-game communications to prevent spamming.  But yes, to answer your question, there's quite a lot of game to play still.
---
not too hard to just wait instead of posting your hate for the game
---
It's actually pretty easy to end up doing with the mount bug that gets you sunk into the ground.
---
Yeah, I'm wondering how much spaghetti they had to touch to get this working. Seems good so far.
---
They CAN but it wouldn’t be worth the dev time
---
quick, ping their usernames
---
if only that were true....
---
It’s cases like these that make me wary of spending real money on gems
---
ITT: Everyone thinking the only people being hired at Anet are well-known artists who tweet about it.
---
Let's just ignore the fact that they're hiring programmers too, but they don't have large social media followings like artists do so we don't hear about them.
---
What do you think people will hear about: an artist who has done artwork for Magic the Gathering, or a back-end systems developer?
---
Speaking as someone who plays with OP regularly, you aren't going to change my mind. They provided proof in the post, they directly quoted from their emails with arenanet, I've seen the video that they sent anet in which they explained exactly what they did to get banned, and that person replicated it easily in trying for under five minutes.
---
It's just really silly you're putting in so much work to argue with people on this, responding to so many posts like you are. There are absolutely people that run to reddit and cry when they did something genuinely wrong, but this isn't one of those cases.
---
hope this gets fixed
---
Too much work for a system that didn't natively support it.
---
I hope they make an exception for legendary backpieces because... those are legendary.
---
As for the rest, I could be happy if they don't retroactively make any dyeable backpieces and just do it for new ones moving forward.
---
ANET Chelsea said implementing capes was one of the most difficult art projects they've ever done. I can only imagine that it must be hell working on older backpieces. Who knows what might be involved? It could involve some weird UV Mapping sorcery that is hell to work with.
---
What do you think you'd hear about: a Magic the Gathering artist being hired, or a back-end developer being hired?
---
....interesting
---
I would bet ducats to croissants that you're correct here. Old code like that is a royal PITA to go back, sift through, and then alter. And the sheer volume of unrelated bugs that could occur as a result...not worth it.
---
guild cape could have been a little bigger
---
One can buy currency nodes for 10,000 Volatile Magic and 50g. However, you can make a party with someone with a full home instance, and when they enter their home instance, you'll be together, with all their nodes to farm. 
---
If someone doesn't advertise their home instance, just ask in map chat, probably someone will help you.
---
So when can I dye my legendary back that is far more valuable than a cape?
---
Thank you!
---
Oh cool! I didn’t know you could share home instances.
---
I love the capes and the idea of dyed back items as but man having to choose between wings and the cape is a tough one. I keep imagining the pvp wings coming out from the sides of my newly dyed cape and have to remind myself I can’t lol
---
The cape goes, *deep breath*: 
---
“BRAABLAHBLAHBLAHBABABLAHBLABBLAHAAA!!!!!”
---
Oh yes, it was a glorious Charrmor Protest in LA. We ran around and threw ourselves off the bank, landing on unsuspecting Anet people who came to watch
---
This is a very good point thank you.
---
I seriously hope they never do that in the near future, don't get me wrong. I'd love to see a gw2-based animation/series but if they ever pull that out, with the current management I'm afraid It would be plagued with PC/SJ characters/themes and the likes of it.
---
awesome!!!!!
---
If only they did it like the Netflix Castlevania anime, I'd be so happy
---
Please stop, I can only get so aroused
---
We don't need to have all information honestly. The fact that they don't tell you why or take a second look is good enough reason to give it attention and hope reddit can make them think twice.
---
Even if he is guilty of something else, he deserves to know that. This is why this stupid ass policy of Anet needs to change. 
---
"We banned you for -reasons- and you ain't gonna know more and we will give you automated or basic replies unless you can show us you can hurt us via a mob."
---
If they can publicly come and say "you were banned for saying n word" here on reddit on these cases for example, they can easily say it in tickets too. So all of that "won't reveal our methods" thing is b/s as well. They go into detail when it starts hurting them just as easily.
---
*cries in roleplay*
---
See you in 3 months.
---
if they make old backpacks dyeable, the new ones they will keep puting in the cash shop won't seem as appealing.
---
Mine is gone as well
---
You missed short living stories, bad metas in small maps, weak ass strike missions.
---
Laziness on updating old equipment with due channels.
---
"I called this one too" If you say every post is a lie, you'll "call" some of them correctly. That doesn't give you any credibility. I could do the exact opposite and would be able to tell you that.
---
I was falsely banned **multiple** times, i had to deal with people like you and it hurts to read these comments when you already feel bad.
---
Even if he is guilty, the fact that they only reveal information in PUBLIC if PUBLIC is against them and refuse to reveal said information in PRIVATE cause "reasons" is enough to bash on Anet.
---
So i'm being as nice as i can here , fuck off.
---
Garbage servers.
---
I barely call a well-written post expressing their love for the game hate. And yes, totally reasonable to wait 3 months, missing christmas events with their guildees, not getting to enjoy decorating the guild hall for the holidays, over something they didn't do.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
This^.
---
LMFAO ur so right. if i saw rytlock irl i would simply walk away
---
what are you smoking? dragonfall was the best patch,which ever happened. They took away pvp/wvw builds and than they put them back aaaaaaaand thats great job? wow.

Good lord, THIS. I've wanted to get rid of the story stuff for so long but it's a shame that it's tied to other element.
---
lets break this down for ya since you seem to have short term memory.

[absolutely](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/akrvhm/vindicated_anet_admits_it_made_a_mistake_and/) but that is one post out of many that are basically "yeah you fucked up"

Yeah, if you use the combo, you'll almost always get stuck in walls.
---
I'd love for my Warbringer to be white flames and gold ribbons. I don't do red at all, and as much as I love the backpiece, the red clashes with all my characters.
---
This is actually very interesting, thanks for the response! I wonder if in future they would consider applying the same system to at least - the glider combos as you indicated.
---
The company had a bad year because they were working on some aide projects that got cancelled and resulted in some layoffs. This shake up caused delays and the staff were underesourced on the core delivery due to these projects. It's no secret that Anet are poorly managed and they restructure the teams so often that release cadence and communication is extremely hit and miss. There's no clear roadmap but it is clear they are working on stuff.
---
That said, the game itself is not in a bad state. It's well populated but their release structure (new map with a bunch of metas and achievements to farm with each release) has meant that the number of new maps over time has spread players out and lowered populations k  each one. They are now doubling down on QoL updates that mean thwes things will be improving (dailies which rotate the maps for example). Balance is in a reasonably good state and new content will be released every 2 months going forward. Story has improved. Gameplay is still being experimented with so there's always some new thing to do. PvP and wvw is getting some focus now too and balance teams are finally split and dedicated across them. Swiss tournaments are coming. 
---
Perhaps if you can clarify when you left and What modes you enjoyed we can offer more relevant information
---
The issue in that case is that there's no reason not to be clear about why they were banned.
---
Figured the most recent one would suffice to jog your memory. Clearly I was wrong [so I made a list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e5qg8z/wrongly_banned/f9ls5n9/) and I stopped quite early in my search, that was page 3 of over 150 pages of hits.
---
This comment is wonderfully ironic because UNF is what people who banned for the null hash last April were told they were using.
---
How else are Norn warriors supposed to meet new people?
---
I believe the back items are coded as weapons. Itd to do woth lack of cod8ng for dye channels. Lack of scripts. Anf coding following the incorrect format.
---
not sure if you are the right person, but currently, legendary weapons skin totally replace the projectile effects of skills. can we put the original skill effects back in but also just add the legendary weapon skin? 
---
currently if you see say,kudzu or pharus, it changes the skill 2,3 of dragonhunter to a single arrow. can we put the original effects in together with the legendary skin arrow? the f1,2,3 are all a single arrow and feels like a downgrade when you have worked so hard for the legendary.
---
And your own bias automatically interpreted his words as an attack on people with limited time, when it was not.
---
They did offer some gems to the players who were banned for the null hash last April... but the amount basically just compensated for the missed dailies during the 6 month ban.
---
I don't agree, but my point is, this is Anet, weapons float AND clip :&gt;
---
Revenant skills work?
---
Nice.
---
Yes please! Especially for the top toolbar.
---
The capes looks like they are using a very simple collision box to represent the player. (They also look like they are animated by physics with simple point and spring/rod system, but it is extremely stiff and has a strong pull to the capes 'neutral' position, probably allowing it to have a relatively low tick rate too). Using a more detailed collision box would hit the games computation limit fast if it was applied to every single player... However I do wonder if they could, for one's own cape, and only one's own, model the character with very detailed collision (perhaps based on actual armor geometry) and make it less stiff, allowing the cape to flow across the back.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
More robust physics could help with Charr tail clipping too. Actually some outfits like the Sentinel Outfit, or Winter Monarch, already fix tail clipping by leveraging the clothing physics as is, so. And their tails can already interact with the gemstore cape too! So Charr tails already seem to have collision for clothing physics...
---
They need to figure out how to LoD physics models/calculations so that they can increase the physics budget for one's own player charterer and allow the physics engine to make these clipping issues disappear... Although CPU crunch of this engine is pretty bad already, and increased physics demands would make it worse...
---
I'm not sure of the relevance of this record. It's very impressive—no doubt. But absolutely no one does 100 CM to stop after killing Skorvald the Shattered. Fractal speed runs should encompass the entire fractal. The premise for this statement is that the portal precasting nonsense is unaccounted for, which I don't think is fair. Personally, I think that the timer should start as soon as anyone uses any skill (including but not limited to pre-combat, pre-mistlock, gizmo, and consumable skills).
---
They follow the same exact policies as any other game. People are human and yes they make mistakes but there are many threads just like this that seem to attract assholes who canymt wait yo voice their displeasure and jump right on the fuck you wagon and blow this shit to kingdom kong without waiting and instantly making a decision based off one side out of 3 of the story. I'll say this as nice as I can, fuck off and hold your bitch fast for when shit eventually hits the fan and you are wrong yet again.
---
Heart of Thorns actually made watching the game much, much harder. They went way overboard in regards to animations, resulting in massive clutter over the entire screen (Glint elite being a great example). Cooldowns for the new specs were so out of line with the previous that the game became an absolute spamfest. On top of that, every new skill had like 3-4 effects piled on top of it. Heart of Thorns did nothing to promote PvP as an eSport. The timing of the release of the expansion just happened to be a good time to also promote the move from weekly tournaments to a league format, but the viewership gained from that was immediately lost (literally in the first week) because of the awful balance that resulted in Bunker Chronomancer.
---
But anyway, to clarify, you think that the addition of elite specializations was the sole development that pushed GW2 into eSports? I don't really see how that's even related.
---
IF they could add the option to never stow your weapons I would be happy happy.
---
Pvp has more bots than players.....XD. im gona keep collecting those flowers instead of listening some random kid with anger issues explaining,why i suck and i shoud kill myself :(
---
As a heavy RP'er back when i played GW2, i used to break out of maps all the time to get into interesting areas, specifically because you could sometimes find fun areas to rp in. We used to do that before \*gliding\*, just by jumping until finding ways to get over things, or until you found a spot with no collision. It only got easier with the inclusion of gliding, and i imagine it's a laughable cakewalk now that people have mounts. Hell, people almost certainly still do this in the dozens to get into uninstanced Salma in DR.   
---
This is... just ridiculous, and assuming everything is on the up and up, you're completely right to be angry. It isn't \*hard\* to find people map breaking. Why they hell are they targeting one random person without warning?
---
The code shouldn't be an issue, the problem is that the art assets probably doesn't exist because they had no reason to exist. The game can't magically know where on the texture a dye channel is supposed to affect.
---
There doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason, since it's in and out of combat. \~6 crashes tonight, on different borderlands as well. It usually affects everyone in the same subsquad, many times multiple subsquads. It doesn't happen to all 3 servers usually. It's usually when there's at least 60+ people in the same general area. 
---
Very frustrating, since if it was mostly on PvE side it'd have been fixed before they went home tonight.
---
That's sort of what I meant, I apologise. Code isn't strictly the best word for it.
---
People also used to hide it with the CombatMode mod, which is probably why some people are confused.
---
Tequatl and the Evolved Jungle Wurm only.  The Karka Queen gives somewhat larger rewards, but it comes in the form of rares and champ bags, not direct gold.
---
While not technically world bosses, various Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire meta events reward Hero's Choice chests upon completion.  Picking the Amalgamated Gemstone out of those gives you an item that sells on the Trading Post for between 80-90 silver, so that's close to a gold, plus the various other rewards from the battle.  If you're looking to do group events for larger rewards than normal world bosses, that's the logical next step for you, assuming you own the expansions at least.
---
\~ 45 GB
---
The download size from the website itself is only I think a few hundred mbs. The launcher will install and then download the rest of the game. Approx 45gb after all is said and done.
---
T O X I C
---
Can you show me how many back-end developers got hired after the massive lay-offs?
---
I think these features were added in as in for now.. they could possibly make adjustments later when they feel the coding is more stable.
---
&gt;implying that ever ended
---
I'm pretty sure that's just Aurene now
---
I hope we get a cape glider just for this reason..
---
It's also great for things like the Storm Dagger and Bow that look silly when stowed.
---
I wonder what's the point of hiding party UI when in/out of combat as opposed to in a party or not.
---
I'd also like to keep track of the active events while at the same time not having the right side of my screen filled with story and achievement progress...
---
One beanie to find them.
---
 zerg is a group of 18-40 people\~ ... and a blob everything past the 45+ people. if three of these constructs fight, that's way more than any pve map usually experiences. and they can fight over the reach of a whole map; while in pve fights happen at one certain point.
---
at bosses like tarir and kralkatorriks elites or at strike missions you see pretty well that tactics isn't as important in pve-metas. people just burst on the foes till either of both dies, but pve groups often have barely any healers around, outside of raids. even in dungeons and lowlevel fractals i saw that happening, but thats only the very softcore part of the gw2 population. there are enough ppl playing wvw and pvp, last but not least because of the pretty good combat system.
---
  
---
it's kinda obvious that there are comp builds for every format... that was never in need of discussion.  
---
you do realize how absurd your comment there is? if anything is toxic, then it's this kind of opinion. i gave you yet tons of options how to revert this. there is enough people playing wvw, just for fuller maps there'd be the need of more servers put together in a link.  
---
you sound like those people who cry around in the mapchat "ded game" 24/7 since years.
---
[removed]
---
I don't think Sam's hood and boba fetts helmet look that similar..
---
It's almost like they anticipate and work on this stuff before reddit complains.
---
There's a torch mechanic in this fight?! Haven't noticed it...
---
I'd rather have playable content than (or better yet: in addition to) balance, qol features and a back skin I don't care about. Just my opinion! This patch did nothing for me. Happy for OP though.
---
A patch is required to throw wintersday stuff in and start it, and next patch is on 17th as that's the date after which we can't see any gemstore comings. Plus the 2 week minimum between each patch tht Anet has been following for quite a while.
---
Thanks, kind sir.
---
Hey man it’s Christmas time, cant hurt to ask for miracles
---
I play on a fast PCIe SSD (~1.8 GBps / 14.4 Gbps) on a 1 Gbps (down &amp; up) fiber connection, and can say that you’ll barely see a difference in GW2. Loading times seem pretty dependent on establishing the server connection, and I’m usually in a map just a second or two sooner than my guildies. I’m guessing this is about as fast as possible with this game, and the server response is the bottleneck. I’d be curious to see verbose loading screens just to be sure though.
---
Literally happened this morning.
---
Judging by the history of Wintersday releases, it's always been in that week.
---
idk, 250kp+ groups on eu tend to be good enough to operate without healbrand
---
We hoped that for Gliders, we hoped that for Mounts. Expect that's all we'll get in-game besides one or two way down the road.
---
The game can download assets as needed, so you’ll be able to start pretty quickly, and it will download new maps when the connection is free.
---
It's the one guy that just makes everything drop 2 blues and a green.
---
Why do mods allow these posts.  What is the point of these rules:
---
* Post to stir up drama.
---
* Use this subreddit as an alternative way of contacting customer support.
---
None of these threads tell the full truth.  These threads serve no interest to the GW2 community other than creating hate for Anet.
---
Sub rules (which appear to be enforced randomly):
---
These posts only create hate for Anet/GW2 and are usually only one side of the story.
---
You're in SFD, the guild on Maguuma that has spent the last 3+ years spouting nothing but racist, homophobic, etc things in team and map chat. 
---
Good jebait though!
---
You won't find common sense on this sub.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/axk50s/bond_of_yeet/
---
Here it is, I've learned it from this video and have been doing it ever since. Haven't been banned yet. But I can see how this might look like cheating to a GM watching from aside. You see, server doesn't correctly broadcast this movement: to an outside observer when you do this - the jump isn't visible, it looks like you teleported from the starting spot to where you landed. If there was an invisible GM spying on the OP, who doesn't know about this "movement tech", they might've reasonable concluded that the player is using cheating tools to teleport from place to place.
---
These QoL are the 'little things' that go a long way in a game, I love it when the little things are taken into account on any product. Hope some bigger things start coming for next year with all the other mmo's making big moves for 2020 and beyond. 
---
And we finally got some capes!
---
If you already have a normal SSD, it's not worth upgrading.
---
What is the hardest class to level? Wondering on which one to use lvl 80 boost on.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The gameplay mechanics however, have not been great lately. Heck they completely abondoned development on raids &amp; fractals which is where the most dynamic and interesting mechanics were.
---
But that's a good thing, since very few players cared about those modes. Now they can focus more attention on the open world content, like the rock concert event.
---
&gt;Yet... instead of hiring to improve their current FLAW... They're hiring more of what they're already good at...
---
Not "instead of," "in addition too." 
---
They are hiring more artists because they need more artists. They are hiring more other things because they need those too, you're just less likely to be aware of that because those people are less "celebrities." We didn't hear about this one because it's the only hiring taking place, we heard about it because this is an artist with fans who posted on her own Twitter, and since she has fans, the news spread. That's all. An ANet employee already came on to make clear that they are also hiring in other roles, you're just less likely to hear about those because the people filling them are less likely to be celebrities.
---
&gt;This practice (to me atleast) seems like mismanagement of funds, *at least on behalf of what I'd like to see out of this game.* 
---
I think perhaps the last bit is the most accurate point made so far. It's important to remember that what you'd like to see out of the game is not necessarily what is *best* for the game, especially since you implied that you thought further focus on raids and fractals would be a *positive* development. Mismanagement is a term. It means when they are doing things wrong *for their business.* If they are merely doing things that *you* don't like, that is not mismanagement, that is just "them doing things that *you* don't like."
---
or you know, seven years
---
I love this sub.  Down voting comments that are likely truthful and up voting the comments which spread speculation and hate towards anet.
---
More flashy gemstore stuff instead of ingame rewards for challenging content... meh
---
i only poke into pvp periodixally, how can you tell who are bots?
---
ikr, its so random, but its great.
---
The loss of fall damage reduction abilities can really be felt, I chased a low health player in WvW off the cliff and he died to fall damage, maybe he didn't think it was lethal with the skill (or thought it was his territory for gliding)
---
LA around 17 seconds and Mistlock around 10 seconds, booting got a little bit faster but also not that much and I saw difference in singleplayer games, but also not that much more than with a ssd
---
In regards to the reason for ban waves and withholding information, that is exactly the case.
---
Let’s say you and 2000 other people are using the same hacking tool. Of those people, 1500 are banned.
---
If you tell those 1500 people why they were banned, and hand them the evidence, you’ve told the developers of the hacking tool *exactly* what they need to fix. “Oh, all 1500 were banned for speed hacks, we need to work on that.”
---
Even just telling the users “you were banned for using ‘3lite h4xor gw2ools’ between these dates” you’ve given out information helping the tool makers. You’re not letting them wonder if it was their tool specifically or if 75% of your user base was dumb and used an older version, or a different tool alongside.
---
It sucks for the very small minority of users that get false bans. I totally agree. But handing out the info is detrimental overall.
---
Should they allow a user to request a second look? Sure. But that comes with man power that they likely don’t have. Level 1 likely can’t look deep enough into the system to research anything beyond superficial things, and it can take hours to properly sift through data.
---
Just wanted to give you some reasoning behind the waves, and lack of info. And a likely reason they don’t readily jump on ban appeals.
---
also missing it as well as in gwefficiency :/
---
Actually build templates are pretty legit if you spend a bit of time learning how to get used to them. I can change a powerDH build into a full heal FB in the matter of seconds. It's pretty awesome
---
&gt; you do realize how absurd your comment there is? if anything is toxic, then it's this kind of opinion. i gave you yet tons of options how to revert this. there is enough people playing wvw, just for fuller maps there'd be the need of more servers put together in a link.
---
The question is not whether or not they can cram together enough servers to generate one map that "feels full." They probably could do that. The issue though is that if they have to put so much effort at cramming people together to generate a full map, why bother? To make WvW work would require specific development time spent *on* WvW stuff. Making specific rewards, designing specific mechanics, they would need to invest in the mode. Why make that investment when the population for the mode is so tiny relative to open world PvE? Why not invest those resources into making the mode most people enjoy most, into the best it can possibly be? 
---
They don't have to kill WvW, but neither can they "save" it, so the question is, are they better off allowing it to coast indefinitely in its current state, and allow the population to adapt to that reality and ideally come to accept it, or do they shut ti down, rather than allow it to continue to fester and populate their community with entitled WvW players demanding that their mode get more attention?
---
A GDPR request is intriguing in this context. I’m definitely not a GDPR expert but I don’t think GDPR requests are limited to Pii only. Is information related to your character considered your personal information (broader than PII)? An argument can be made that your character is an extension of you—your chat logs, your played statistics, system and connection information— all seems like something GDPR would cover. Also, doesn’t GDPR give you the right to contest false info? I’d file a GDPR request and raise hell if they seem to be restricting the info they are giving you.
---
So they still haven't added ability to swap all 6 runes at once in legendary armour?
---
I'm not saying things should be a cakewalk, but the game is also not a platformer and locking people out of content via MPs because they are unable to platform in a non platforming game seems more than a little unfair. If the devs wanted to disallow the use of portals in the JPs they could've easily done that, and yet they haven't.   
---
I cannot speak to Raids, but so far I have only seen them used in Fractals to help parties skip parts of paths, same with open world events.
---
GGG does that quite often. and the players love them for that. i mean, sure, its time where a dev cant work on something buuut it takes away a lot of anger from people and gives them a bdtter grasp of the content
---
I really hope there's a small fix for this in the future, because it's hard to wear when it's this noticeable on legendary armor, which I'd rather not take off as it's my first set on my main character.
---
Clipping is the sacrifice we have to make to get capes.
---
The literal first rule that's posted in our guild's discord is:
---
"1 - No hate, bigotry, racism, sexism, misogyny, etc. If Trump would say it, you should not. This will be aggressively enforced as per the \[Guild Leader\] Ate Hate initiative. "
---
They are not templates. They are loadouts.
---
But then you will you ~~press F to Taimi~~ idle while Taimi monologues for five minutes?
---
You seem to be confusing our guild somehow with general map/team chat in Maguuma WvW. About the most any of us ever say is "Thanks SFD" after we capture something or wishing our guild leader a happy 50th birthday.
---
Like in the old days.
---
WvW should be just above dungeons then.
---
The best thing you can do is play gw1, the skill system of gw2 will certainly not change, enjoy what you like and stop doing what you don't like just because you hope it gets better or it will change.
---
I can kinda understand why they go with a general "third party program" message, for those type of hackers that use multiple programs. If someone like that gets banned, and gets the message they got banned for Program A, they give them lots of information like that.
---
That person can just go like "well I guess Ill just use only Program B and C then" when they get unbanned. Or worse, spread that info along their friends, figure out what specifically it is about Program A that allows Anet to detect it, make new and more undetectable hacks with that info...
---
In the extras section it is... just not individual.  You can hide events in the top right.
---
Personally, I think that if it's something that many would do when not trying for a speed clear, then it's fine as part of a record run. In the case of Artsariiv, nearly every CM group and many (if not most) non-CM groups have at least one player using CC cons during the splits.
---
Perfect opportunity to move on from the game; I'd use it.
---
They will never tell you exactly why you were banned, because they don't want to confirm which bots/hacks they can detect. 
---
Back in the good old days I have had multiple accounts banned for botting, but on my main account I levelled 2 characters by doing world exploration with an automated teleport hack and the account is still active (most of the botting ones also are after a few appeals, actually). 
---
I asked for specifics in every case and was never given any; only that they are confident in their decision and it is not up for dispute, so I don't think you'll have much luck either, unfortunately.
---
More mobs and more drops, I agree.  There is way too much downtime between the current solo mobs and they aren't individually rewarding.
---
There are black lion weapon sets so old that they literally have a canonical black market for them. Like. GW2 has been monetized by cosmetic purchases since existing. "Wanting capes forever" doesn't disincentivize ANet from monetizing them just like all the other pretty things. And yet. AND YET. There is an in-game cape you can buy right now without any real money, and a way to trade in-game currency for the other.
---
I'm a Scrooge too, but this ain't it.
---
They have no influence on fractal, but they do add new HoT/PoF sets of masteries and MPs.
---
&gt;Cool, but was it this specific individual, or are you also to be held accountable for any and everything anyone in your guild ever posts in map chat?
---
&gt;  Our guild has a no racism, no transphobia, no homophobia guideline and we are pretty strict about it.
---
?
---
"need" is subjective
---
NVME SSDs come standard with many computers today.  And costs about $79 for a namebrand x4 500GB one.
---
People have been getting under stormwind and ironforge for 15 years in wow and blizzard would never ban for it. The recent duel tournament took place under stormwind too. This being bannable is completely idiotic.
---
Yeah that's actually interesting choice..
---
smells like a bought account
---
I don't work at ANet, so no. Companies of that size typically don't give out their employee roster. So unless they tweet about it, and have a large enough following to see that tweet, you won't know.
---
It states on the article..
---
&gt; * While we cannot add dye channels to existing backpieces, keep an eye out for dyeable backpacks of different styles in the future!
---
They often have some of the best spots to grind for materials or gear. For instance, winterberry bushes on one of the LW maps are an easy way to get some ascended accessories.
---
Personally I feel like revenant is a pain since a lot of your synergy and useful traits are locked till later, you don't feel like a real class till at least level 30 or so. You also have to put a lot of points into your skills since you have 2 full sets of heal, utility, and elite skills per setup to unlock and use and you're trying to get important traits as well. If I had to pick another one I think I'd go with mesmer *but* they have gotten a lot better to level with after the main clone rework.
---
Hi Anet,
---
I just purchased the Cape for my guardian. It looks great. I hope things improve for you guys, with MO's departure and all.
---
Regards,
---
Stephen.6312.
---
Agree
---
But he is right you know
---
I made my own solo guild for that, chose pve weekly missions and did trek missions where you need to find places around Tyria (there's dulfy-guide for that)
---
&gt;Use this subreddit as an alternative way of contacting customer support.
---
Problem with this: Anet doesn't tell you shit when you get banned, even if this person got rightfully banned, please tell them what they did. So this is more like a feedback post more than anything else.
---
Mostly it's because NPCs are stationed at a location with respawning enemies
---
If you are working on a new build and have the budget for an nvme drive, or are replacing a spinning platter with a ssd and your motherboard supports it, sure, get the nvme.
---
But if you already have a sata ssd, or getting that nvme drive will force you to make sacrifices elsewhere, then it's not worth it (unless that sacrifice is forgoing something even more useless like rgb).
---
Thank you, had never thought about it enough to look up verbose loading, but will add this argument when I play tomorrow.
---
I hope one day they'll make legendary backpacks dye-able.
---
GW2 is learning the classic gw1 style \^o\^b
---
What‘s the issue with anet making money? Not like you need to have it
---
Is it similar to Magic in terms of summoning creatures and spells, or is this more of a cast spell/counter spell directly at each other?
---
GW1 and GW2 are two different games, they share the same lore and name but that is pretty much it. Expecting that the one game changes because you like the other one more is ridiculous.
---
I think what many today forget is that GW1 also had its problems, a lot of problems just like GW2 has today.
---
One of these problems was the massive amount of skills that were in the game. It opened up a lot of varieties and angles you could play but as soon as you figured out a really great team composition you basically were unbeatable. I watched a WP video about GW1 a long time ago in which he walked through a map without a single heavy class Hero in his group and mowed everything down. I don't think that is a good balance for a game. Another thing is that those massive amounts of skills create a massive problem in PvP because you had to use certain build comps or you wouldn't have a chance.
---
GW1 also only had its main releases as campaigns that really brought more content to the game, later the EotN expansion which you had to pay for. IIRC only Guild Wars beyond and Sorrow's furnace were a free content update, even the Bonus mission packs were heavily criticized because you had to buy them.
---
And that brought a problem with it, people played those campaigns and had nothing else to do and left the game after finishing them. My guild, created on release of GW1, went from active in the first few months to lower and lower activity until the next release was around the corner.
---
&gt; almost daily release of new cosmetic transactions
---
A serious question here. How do you think GW2 is able to fund development without those cosmetics in the gem store? Would you want to pay a full-price game yearly or even twice a year as you would have with GW1? How about a subscription-based system?
---
I don't know about you (the general you) but I would like that the devs, artists and designers get paid for what they do. Expansions take a long time to create and don't give you any lasting revenue, you can say what you want about it but if you think about it other solutions would probably much worse. It is not that there are not enough skins in the game or that you can't just trade the gold for the gems...
---
Now, I'm not saying that GW2 is better than GW1 and I'm not defending those decisions someone made over the years, I have played GW1 for ~4000 hours, GW2 for over 5300 hours and I like both games for their own things. However, comparing them does none of these games any favour and does a disservice to why, for some people, either of these games is great and fun to play.
---
How do you know?  If this was the case, this sub would be flooded with wrongly banned posted.........
---
The difference between both should be negligible at least for loading maps in GW2.
---
I have 2 computers at home, one gaming desktop with a NVME SSD and one gaming laptop with a sata SSD. Both have GW2 installed and as i have 2 accounts i have tested it multiple times (i like to run the WvW and PvP easy dailies with both accounts at the same time). If i set all the options for both accounts the same (graphics etc...) and jump with both accounts at the same time to the same map they ussually load more or less at the same time (maybe 1 second of difference sometimes but it could be because i didn't press the travel button exactly at the same time). 
---
Of course you have to consider that sometimes the game stucks (maybe network connection?) and one of the accounts takes considerably much longe time to load, but that's caused by an external effect, not due to the SSD itself.
---
On my usual runs i have higher settings on the account that i use on the desktop (it's newer and it's the one i use with my main account). In the end that means the NVME takes 4-5 seconds more time to load, but that's because it has to load all the extra stuff from the higher quality settings.
---
They never said the ban was for being out of bound, but for using a third party software, we only have one side of the story here. OP is just speculating that the ban was because he was out of bounds.
---
If it was merely for being "out of bounds", more than half of the population would be banned by now, it's so easy to get out of bound (even not intentionally).
---
I never had a twiter account, so I don't know either.
---
But I'll be the first in line to cheer when we have any hint of new coders coming in.
---
Top tier endgame content.
---
Let's go fight some God and Dragon disaster level monsters.
---
In order for this to be a feedback post, the OP would need to provide feedback.  Instead they told their side of the story, that's it.  The result is everyone in this thread being confused as to whether or not leaving the boundaries of the map is ban worthy, and saying how bad anet/support/communication is.
---
Further, Anet/support doesn't discuss bans because they don't want to provide information that can be used by exploiters/cheaters to circumvent or avoid the tools/software anet uses to find these people.
---
Moreover many people get out of bounds by mistake (for example using a jump skill on buggy surfaces), so it's really unlikely that OP was banned for just being "out of bounds", if it was the case most players would be banned by now.
---
A lot of guilds will start doing missions again these upcoming weeks, why not join one?
---
I use all builds on my guardian sans wvw pvp and have legendary armour and trinkets. Still super easy and useful. No problems whatsoever.
---
classic anet. i think anet has sayings like "shoot first, ask question later" or "guilty until proven innocent" written on their employee handbook.
---
Haha that's the first thing I did
---
Now Anet just need to release a tanooki suit.
---
Can I pay instead 50 gems for a random reply?
---
Wow do you realize they just keep the server alive selling those right ? Moreover u can get them with kwyfarming too if u do not want to pay
---
Just tried it right now and I got in right away.
---
aurora peachy.
---
Extremes are average for new releases in those games. Just saying.
---
You shouldn't have to 'learn' how to use a fucking build template. It should be pretty straight forward thing. Even the ArcDps thing was more intuitive and it was basically as barebones as it gets.
---
&gt;walked through a map without a single heavy class Hero in his group and mowed everything down.
---
Because they haven't balanced the game since GW2 was released. And evne then, a full player team with the perfect builds still has to play it perfectly.
---
Look at the DOA Speedclears, or Urgoz. Mesmers and an assassin or two - still you'd NEVER do it as fast if you're not a literal god at GW1.
---
This is absolutely magnificent. One of the best Sylvari arts I've ever seen!
---
ohhhhhhh nice! Reading some of those fire magic cards, fire looks really strong.
---
I don't think there's a single game support that will disclose details of bans.  So this isn't anet specific.  
---
As to why any of them won't enter dialog, I guess it just isn't worth it, time wise.  They've no way of telling the false responses from the truthful ones.  
---
Just as here, you say you didn't abuse the map break but we don't 'know' that.
---
4 Dual Skills and 1 Quadra Skill?
---
I never had a problem buying gems, now not so much. Idc about the skins anymore, even if I like them.
---
PM ME?
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Exactly.  OP won't have been banned for sightseeing.  They'll have been banned for repeatedly gaining material advantage by map breaking, or doing it in such a fashion that they're triggering some kind of alarm system that's designed to prevent expooits, or they found a super-secret debug area.
---
I wouldn't be surprised that ANet don't want to reveal the true reason in order that they protect their methods of detection, and so the banned player doesn't do a full reveal of their methods of exploit.
---
Funamentally, the use of third-party tools IS against the terms of service, so If you use third-party tools and ANet decide that you need to be banned, they'll just ban you for that.
---
Bloodstone dust, empyreal fragments and dragonite ore can be recrafted into bricks, etc, those do have various usages in endgame crafting, so having some supply is very wise idea. Each piece takes 100, so you can get rid of all the basic tier materials that way. Or you can use gobblers to get some random loot.
---
Auric dust can be recrafted into auric ingots, those don't have that much use once you get auric weapons set done (you can get free weapons from HoT story, from pvp/wvw reward tracks, or just craft them with ingots), however at the start or Auric Basin, you can once per day turn in one auric ingot into provisioner token, which is the absolute cheapest way to get them (costs like 2 silver per token if you buy slivers for crafting ingots) and quite good sink for those. Otherwise it is all fulgurite for generation 2 legendary weapons (auric dust, maintenance oil, leyline sparks)
---
But the racing scarf has very good cloth physicd.
---
I didnt say the game is dying... ever... i didn't even imply it.
---
As for "mismanagement of things", that is 100% a matter of personal taste. Not from an economic standpoint sure, but from my preference of game content, it's being mismanaged. Which is what iv been saying from the start. 
---
I never said what they're doing is "wrong". I said it's not what i want them to be doing, thus the complaint.
---
&gt;You've given your 2 cents, and I think most have given their 2 cents, nobody needs to be given those same 2 cents repeatedly.
---
It was a response to someone not understanding why anyone would be unhappy/unsatisfied... so i explained why some people (such as myself) feel the way we do.
---
I personally don't think there was anything unreasonable or illogical in what i said.
---
Oh maps with lord... run ahead and break the lord wall before the match starts.
---
It breaks the bot pathing and they only run toward the door over and over and get stuck (since the door isn’t actually broken).
---
Bots are predictable in gw2 but you have to watch and be aware of what’s happening and often players in PvP are hyper focused so they don’t always notice what the bots are doing...
---
Make no mistake they are there on low tiers and overnight type dead hours.
---
Since OP plays WvW, my bets he used macros/teleport hacks in there on other proxy accounts, and now anet is finally doing something about them
---
I have actually been suspended for 6 months with the April '18 wave for using an unapproved third party utility.
---
prepare for downvotes, because anet is now totally dedicated and listening to their players and not just working off a 7 year old to-do list to bait out the moneyzzz, look active, and generally work out some kinks to maximise revenue for when maintenance mode actually hits. also there is no middle ground.
---
*/s* in case it wasn't obvious.
---
working exactly as advertised. all the setting does is hide that section of the UI under the specified circumstances. nothing more, nothing less.
---
I wouldn't praise them just yet. Its been around 340 days since the last fractal and ages since the last raid. The stuff they've been doing is nice but what is the cost? Strikes are great but they're not a replacement for new fractals.
---
9 months ago i replied in that topic wondering how they did it, now i raptor leap and just before i land, leap of faith to make truly enormous leaps like this one all the time out of boredom. but i have never tried with the doggo to break maps. now i will.
---
&gt;edi5t: Dude why did you change ur comment
---
I did?
---
&gt;I didnt say the game is dying... ever... i didn't even imply it.
---
Some have, I am addressing the broader concern as well as directly addressing your post. 
---
&gt;As for "mismanagement of things", that is 100% a matter of personal taste.
---
Nope. Mismanaging is entirely based on results. If they are doing things that measurably cause lower-than-likely returns, then that is mismanagement. If they do everything that you hate and nothing that you like, but turn a higher profit for doing so, then that is not mismanagement. That is just "them not doing things how you'd like." To make a case for mismanagement, you would need evidence that the alternatives would be more profitable for them. 
---
There is no such thing as "mismanagement of my preferences as a customer." 
---
&gt;I personally don't think there was anything unreasonable or illogical in what i said.
---
If true, then that would be part of the problem.
---
I thought boneskinner would have some mechanics similar to Samarog's — CC the boss or it will kill one player.
---
hey /u/dornsinger, can you look into this case please.
---
My very first days in an MMO was the Factions preview weekend.
---
That’s exactly when I started gw1 so I agree... Cantha and all the excitement of gw1 is what’s really needed to save gw2
---
It is the same in GW with JQ and HA.
---
If only they would do it with the other PvP modes.
---
I used to thought that those monsters were mini-pets whom every class could use back in 2016
---
Welp that's unfortunate.
---
Probably someone copypasted code of LS4 board in order to make that new material board from That_Shaman datamine post. 
---
Lost mine board as well.
---
That would be worse and unnecessary.
---
Longbow dragonhunter has trash damage, probably even less that hammer Scrapper after hammer buffs
---
Why would Anet pay for a comment like that in the first place? Makes no sense really.
---
We don't even know if that's why he got banned in the first place.
---
It's his word against an entity that does the industry norm and says nothing.
---
It does amaze me how quickly people believe whatever someone says in these instances (*eyes the banwave a few months ago being blamed n ArcDPS users*) when it ended up being an account sharing/trading issue.
---
When you think about it hiding weapons, build templates and capes came out REAL fast and in succession to one another.
---
Just in case: You can now hide stowed weapons just like backpacks, gloves etc
---
Ravenna is a nice city!
---
So this is the expansion like features they were teasing.
---
I'm honestly happy.
---
I have normal SSD and loading a map full of players takes between 5 - 10 seconds (even when I just was there before), thanks to slow connection. With normal HDD loading was around 10 - 20 seconds. There won't be any difference between NVME SSD and normal SSD.
---
That's pretty shitty. You can break out of Malchor's  Leap just by logging out &amp; back in real quick just standing in the center of the map, no wall hugging, no going over the map. If you change your mind &amp; need to log back in on that character real quick you fall under the map into water when you log back in, totally not intentional.
---
[Except it's way more common to be right](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e5qg8z/wrongly_banned/f9ls5n9/)
---
Not long before gw1 went into maintenance mode, they also gave us things we asked for many years, dunno man.
---
Thing you saw on youtube is true: I was user of "basic" SSD with 500/450 read/write speed and now I use NVMe one with 3500/3300 read/write speed and my loading times were improved by max 1,5 seconds at best.
---
I tell you more - I tried to upload the whole game into RAM (my speed is close to 50k for both read and write) and my loading times didn't change because of server connection as other people say.
---
1%
---
Create your own guild, races can be leeched off of other guilds, you only have to be one of the 15 to finish the race for your guild to get credit for it. When there 2 races the same, you can run the first race &amp; be one of the 15 accept credit, start the 2nd same race, run it again if you have time for a 2nd run before time runs out, bam 2 races done.
---
This! Thank you for you words.
---
I don't play a huge amount of pvp but can't you /gg out of there?
---
Wow u feel bad just for this. I just explained why ppl go afk in ranked and, for noobs it is ok this way and is a valid suggestion if u do not like PvP and since u do not rank above bronze u will not ruin anything for those who care about PvP. It is what ? The 10000 times I said this to u ? U do not agree but this is how it works
---
This is ruining the game for everyoooooooooone .
---
You are trolling but I ma ok now that I understood you are doing .I am feeding you since I am bored so plz tell me again how this will rui. PvP for everyone
---
Indeed, try rifle deadeye lmao
---
Gw1's active development phase was shorter than gw2 core game though.
---
They're meant to do that, and you would've known with a little bit of research.
---
Let's not ask for actual downgrades to fix a supposed downgrade.
---
Just don’t look at capes from the side.
---
seen one punch men all over.....it is a plague!
---
While 80% is fine to kill bosses, I wouldnt call it great. 80% is very easy to reach even while pressing general buttons in a random order. I usually get 85-90% bench myself when I try the rotation for the first time. That being said, you both have valid opinions. If you can hit bench but suck at mechanics noone wants to play with you. If you know mechanics and do decent dps thats probably better for most groups, but being able to get 95% benchmark consistently means that you know what you're doing on that class and have more energy to focus on the mechanics in the fight rather than your rotation
---
Two rules to live by:
---
1) Everyone lies
---
2) The logs never lie
---
Its not hugely dependent on the mechanics of the fight, its the difference between amazing dps and great dps. If you do golem opener you can get around 35-36k. If you time your confusion burst around his autos you will get 38k+
---
If you link it to me here or on the SC public discord ill help you out
---
It looks like 2 charr cubs were under the cape and swordfighting the hell out of it :-D
---
Maybe in guildchat but I'd prefer to pick a "family" name to my characters so every char has a uniqe name.
---
As someone who makes it a personal mission to map break every new map and instance on release day, this is ridiculous. There are so many methods in-game which allow you to break out of the map. With the removal of void jumping (getting under the map and  re-logging under the desired location) there is no way to use map breaking to gain an in-game advantage. Once you're out, you're basically stuck there until you WP or die to fall damage. 
---
There are certain methods that may appear to be hacks but are intact just wonky game mechanics. Jump casting. Weapon stow during leap. Triple jumping. The only way these give a player an unfair advantage is if used to map break WvW to get into towers. Even just spam jumping on mounts gives the illusion of flying. Warclaw in WvW is the perfect example of that. 
---
There is a secret part of the community dedicated to map breaking and finding cool things outside the playable area. Dev signatures and names. Missing content. Unfinished rooms, etc. Banning someone for simply exploring that, whether it appear to be a hack or not is ruthless. 
---
One of my friends who is an official gw2 partner bases their content almost completly on map breaking dungeons and fractals. &lt;3 Purple Miku. Anet shouldn't be able to pick and choose who they ban for the same actions. Especially considering it's the content that an official partner creates
---
I hope OP gets unbanned swiftly. Happy map breaking.
---
Casual content for a casual player base :)
---
Going out of bound is a serious strategy for dungeon speedruns. I think you should be unbanned.
---
They are all 100% legit. Noone cheats on the benchmark (the people from SC at least, but im pretty sure the others have enough integrity not to cheat on them)
---
Is this some low quality bait?
---
The ladder is true, but that doesn't dismiss the former. Try again.
---
Curious to (hopefully) hear an answer from ANet here.
---
That is exactly what I do. All my characters have Thanos as their family name (and no, not a reference to the marvel character ^^).
---
So for example : Elea Thanos, Rorik Thanos, Muriel Thanos, Duom Thanos etc.
---
Not sure the effect is going to last through starting the actual boss fight tho. It's worth trying, run a staff with bloodlust on spirit woods for instance and see if I get the extra power on Gorse with sword.
---
That's not true. Anet as by virtue of the terms of service full right to ban your account for any reason they so choose. A GDPR request does not give you any access to internal system information such as what triggered the ban. They don't have to explain to you how you got caught. The method in which a ban was determined is not a "reasonable" method of acquiring the identity of the data subject.
---
Are they all of the same class or do they have bots that can play anything?  During the brief time I played Hearthstone it was the period where shaman bots were everywhere.
---
Servers were really wonky yesterday. Haven't played today but wvw was awfull yesterday after patch. Skilllags and rubberbanding in small fights. Couldnt dismount etc. 
---
Usually stuff like this happens only in nig threeway fights but yesterday in nearly every single fight with more than 20 ppl.
---
Didn't crash myself but saw others having that problem. Also experienced major skilllags, rubberbanding etc in every fight. Not in the usual huge threeways but in every fight with more than 20 ppl. Servers were really wonky after patch yesterday. Dunno how it's today.
---
&gt;It's a fairly common practice in wvw and open world to stack sigils with a weapon set and then camp the weapons you intend on using.
---
There's a difference, though. You're deliberately choosing to not use half your weapon skills with another profession in order to gain that buff. On ele/engi you're not losing your attunements or kits. So there isn't any tradeoff like above.
---
IMO, don't hold your hopes high for this to remain like it is now. I expect it to be fixed. Even though both classes are currently underperforming in pve, this isn't really the way to address it.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Universal_Outfit_Ticket - Yes, timekeeper outfit is in there. 
---
2,800 gems is $35USD, and the next one up is 4,000 gems for $50 USD. So it would make more sense to get the 2,800 and then a 800 gem package for $10 USD, or just gold -&gt; gems the remaining 200 if you don't plan on buying anything else. 
---
The rates are listed on https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem for USD, Pounds Sterling, and Euros :)
---
An exception to that 2nd rule:
---
2.(Exception A): For incompetent Anet devs who can't be bothered to sanity check an automated ban tool  for hashes of empty files: never trust the logs.
---
Where will you be when diarrhea strikes?
---
Thank you.  That's interesting, other users were saying NVME doesn't have any effect in GW2 and that the holdup is server end.  
---
The x4 speeds you're getting of 3500/3300 is what I was seeing on Youtube.  A video I was looking at compared a number of games and the average seemed to be around a 1 second, but no MMOs were present that I saw.  So I wasn't sure if it would have the same 1 second or more or less.  
---
I'm not sure why you got times similar to what I saw on Youtube and most others saw no difference.  Regardless, that 1 second is really small so I guess not worth much.  
---
How about your experience otherwise such as booting up and other games and applications?  Do you regret going to NVME?
---
So you're saying you've been falsely banned a dozen or more times and rightfully banned a handful more from this game?  Extra doubt.
---
Chests are daily already, so I don't see your point. What you get through the repeatable achievement, you could get through loot.
---
I would actually make Aurora if I could hide the dumb orbs
---
Human Cultural T3 . Medium.
---
You can nerf what's good, or buff what's bad. I prefer the second approach, since it doesn't ruin what already works.
---
To address the points you brought up:
---
- most people grind yes (not all), but this is mostly to 1. Show the potential of the class and 2. Not have everyone constantly message you about how they beat the benchmark. Unfortunately this is a real thing and some people find it rather annoying.
---
- weapon stowing is used in some benches, but the bench that really benefits from this is dgh and it will only make a difference of 800dps max at the end.
---
- honestly this one is completely pointsless, its part of the class and rotation and you should practice it on golem so you can use it on boss (tempest air 5 for example).
---
- Different buffs is completely irrelevant for the end number. We always use the same class buffs (spotter, frost, sun, ea, double banner) and the boons we use are either realistic or the class doesn't scale off remaining boons so we just press all boons since its faster. The classes where condi's and boons matter are all done correctly (only class is guardian which has retal, but you can easily achieve perma retal in raids).
---
- the only class from the top of my head thats done like this is firebrand which also has a bench without allies. Its just there to show its "real" dps.
---
- well if you dont have infusions you will do less dmg, kind of a no brainer.
---
Hope this clears stuffbup
---
Like I mentioned in my post 
---
&gt; It also depends on what game mode you're talking about, if it's burst damage or sustained, cleave (of which something like reaper has a ton), etc.) 
---
Yes, power reaper has good DPS but for sustained DPS you're talking about 29-31k DPS which is on the low end. DH, Weaver, Berserker, DD, Chrono, etc all bench higher.
---
&gt; Rangers have fullzerk Power Soulbeast wich is like the second strongest bursting elite in the game after Weaver and before Dragonhunter
---
Again what are we talking about? OWP procs on lots of hits vs pre stacking traps or ashes of the just abuse, weapon conjures, single burst skills, lots of ways to get crazy burst damage and different break points for each. Like if the phase is only 4-5s long SB isn't going to beat DH, Berserker, Weaver. A lot of it's "Burst" is just sharing OWP for huge group DPS and once that is down the burst drops a ton so lots of bosses with phases you get it for 1 phase then nothing (which yes is still usually worth it and great to bring but it's not like you would bring a second SB over a DH). 
---
&gt; Problem with those two classes is that they're recommended to newer players and therefore have an influx of people who don't know their shit.
---
Not taking that into account at all, I've seen all kinds of off-meta builds played really well by good players, 
---
 good builds played by bad players and everything in between but that's really not the point or what I'm basing my response on.
---
&gt; For the longest time necro dps was an absolute meme and really trashy but since PoF they got turned around.
---
It still needs a buff, what's the profession with the lowest sustained power DPS: Reaper, even banner berserker is better now.
---
&gt; while permastab
---
You mean the 3s stability trait that you wouldn't take in raids or fractals to crit cap?
---
&gt; Condi Scourge wich has not that much raw deeps but can bounce existing stacks of conditions
---
That would be the utility of scourge, transferring conditions from your target to additional targets like Soulless Horror's Tormented Dead and Flesh Wurms or the Wisps on Sabir CM. 
---
Then you're talking about WvW which I didn't cover and is a whole different thing to PvE
---
It is probably harder to do because trinkets do not have wardrobe skins like weapons
---
Im going to be brutally honest, but class choices or benchmark rankings is not whats holding back those players
---
Remember when the white knights, fanboys, shills, and naysayers of all kind said adding dye channels to back items was absolutely impossible, and everyone asking for them as a stupid armchair developer and a toxic entitled elitist?
---
Well, where are they now?
---
https://i.imgur.com/gdplrzw.jpg
---
I wish they would revitalize guilds by adding a few of them, with GW1-like trims and stufflike that.
---
Probably won't happen, but who knows, things seem to be changing a bit, we're getting quite a few skins outside the gem store lately.
---
There are no bots in Ba Sing Se.
---
Shhhh. Gold fits everything. Or I'll make it fit xD
---
But it's not as simple as "Just have these coders work on raids / fractals" 
---
Raids and fractals use the same core engine as the rest of the game so programmers messing with damage and combat interactions have to be coordinate with every other part of the game.
---
Added yesterday.
---
Damn, I was really hoping this would be part of the UI chance. Ah well.
---
What build are you playing? You have to go out of your way, and really try hard to do that low damage with rampage.
---
Didn't i just asnwer how to grind for shit in the game because the person said there is nothing to grind for... Also grinding in an mmorpg, Gasp!
---
An alternative would be to allow us to nickname them inside the guild panel like you can your friend list and click list.
---
New lfg, who dis?
---
&gt;So instead your proposed system is to not ban people for anything,
---
Yes please enter the topic with 1 extreme side instead, cause there is NOTHING in between the two choices. You either do what they do or ban nobody.
---
Lol.
---
Underboob Meta
---
There are other ways to get gold instead of doing fractals, a lot of places give way more gold per hour than fractals can ever get you. Fractals are just a more fun way of getting the gold.
---
People just afk because there is nothing to do. The shrines won't get destroyed or even damaged and the mobs  don't give anything. You can simply wait till the extra events spawn or treat it like the casino event and wait for the frosty pinata and get progress for the whole meta.
---
&gt;They follow the same exact policies as any other game
---
I can say from another game i play, GGG support is highly different for the game Path of Exile and do tell you some details. So you are starting to lie just to defend Anet. Typical.
---
Imagine being so deep in you do PR work for free.
---
That's not what he means.
---
If you have your Astralaria in 2 or more Gearloadouts, and manually switch it out for, say, a sword, the Infusion and Sigil that were on Astralaria will be put into your inventory (unless you use both in another Gearloadout, in which case they just go into the Armory instead of your inventory).
---
The Stats will also change if you switch to another loadout where you use Astralaria.
---
Remember Ascalon!
---
[Ehhh idk about that](https://youtu.be/k1WJpOjbFt0), it's a meme but not hammer scrapper levels of meme.
---
Originally they were meant to happen in real-time (hence the name), which is why season 1 is unplayable.
---
Season 2 onward are like continuations of the personal story line, with all kinds of little goodies attached to the seasons (new zones, mounts after PoF, etc).
---
it's a joke
---
because they are the ones who are affecting the game for others by sneaking bots in secretly
---
I love the idea but it honestly feels inconsistent with all the other trinkets. I think the best way to fix this is by reworking cosmetic aura effect entirely. Create a brand new wardrobe tab where effects can be unlocked for all characters. This also clears up all the effects clutter that come from stacking same infusions since you’re only allowed to pick one.  
---
This does form a major issue though since you’re not allowed to trade infusions anymore after soulbinding them.
---
Well we did get the Djinn map. Didnt change much. Would prefer something to mix daily dose of pvp up a bit.
---
And there was yet again mass outrage over banning of "Innocent" accounts which turned into "you created 412 different accounts. This was blatant abuse"
---
IDK why you were banned. I have gotten off the map and used it to get collections and everything I could. I even skipped jumping puzzles with it. I have also shown some devs the off map places. So that's kinda stupid you got banned
---
circumventing a game's intended design for a strategic advantage is usually considered cheating.
---
OP doing it for the artistic/exploration aspect at least has some merit and makes a case for reversing the ban.
---
if OP was using it for an game advantage that would be making the case in favour of upholding the ban.
---
As with most skins and designs: It's a matter of taste
---
no. only left hand - thumb and pointer finger. right hand is very spastic and very hard to control.
---
That was my initial thought aswell. It’s certainly the correct length for a sword.
---
arcdps will probably never find its ways into gw2, but there is a small chance for the mount radial, but it is is not really needed because you can just use the addons.
---
Well I can appreciate my concerns are not the same as others, but the guardian quickness meta is fucking god awful to me.
---
two one punch men
---
That often starts happening when people try to point out "unfair prices" with ingame purchases. People kept bringing up the costs in gems in dollars of what it would theoretically cost to buy all build templates for 10 different characters while realistically, 99% of the people dont even use that many and definitely will use gold to gem conversion as much as possible instead
---
GET THE HECK OUT OR HERE WITH YOUR CALM DEMEANOR AND GRAB A PITCHFORK!!!
---
oh wow, 412! wonder how long that took.
---
i think the only thing we know for sure is that nobody knows exactly whats happened when its just OPs post in a thread like this.
---
So how do I farm these guild currencies :0
---
&gt; I love balls.
---
Giggedy
---
basic guild cape lets me think that there will one day be a better version of it. hopefully bigger than the current one this one is tiny
---
Except that’s not the case. There are dozens of individuals involved in the banning of accounts. Unless you are stating that “the government” is a single judge and executioner that handles criminal justice in America?
---
There will always be innocents caught up in these things, there’s just no way around it. It sounds bad, but you have automated systems with humans backing them up. There’s very likely no other way to handle it really, due to pure volume. 
---
The problem in my eyes is that we don’t have an innocent to guilty ratio to compare things with. If there is a 0.1% innocent to guilty ratio, is that acceptable? 0.01%? Because we may already be there and not even realize it. 
---
We don’t have a representative number of either side here on reddit. You’re not going to get people coming on and stating “anet banned me and it was totally warranted”, all we ever see are proclamations of innocence which are really a crap shoot on which way they get sussed out.
---
They don't ban for map breaking, I'm sure. More likely is that they screwed up and flagged OP for 3rd party program that he didn't use. It has happened before.
---
I'm being emotional? Me? Not you? Stop projecting.
---
I'm saying that the practice is bad, you are the one keeps talking about how often they are baddies and act like the innocent that get fucked meanwhile is just collateral damage no biggie. You are the one that is all emotional here cause white knighting only works via emotions.
---
I love how you repeat company's PR talk back at me. 
---
&gt; if it was a ban wave they do it in waves because it stops them from knowing exactly what triggered it or when it was caught. It's to stop them from beating the detection systems, that's also why they dont post PUBLIC INFORMATION same goes for giving an exact reason why they were banned PRIVATELY this is standard practice in almost any MMO.
---
Now you changed it from other games to MMOs, because my example shut your lie down? :D Hahah.
---
And no, as i said elsewhere banwaves are mostly used for making a big impact on the cheat sellers, because losing majority of their customers in a single day hurts them financially. The rest is just laughable and you believe it makes it funnier. Maybe you should talk with some hack makers and see what they have to say about it. 
---
&gt;even with multiple "I was wrongly banned" posts proving my point that 95% of the time people lie and push it publically
---
Your point is simply "but ppl are bad too", nobody says otherwise so you just talk to yourself, prove the point to yourself and call it a day. Brain injury keeps giving.
---
The GENERAL point is that, innocent ppl shouldn't need to go through this process to prove their innocence and you cannot just call them collateral damage and ignore it. Try to keep up this time, it is becoming lame and boring.
---
mods used to be cool , until somewhere in 2015 i think, they became ban happy and anal
---
Key from https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers : Yes
---
Keys from other other sites probably just dget your account banned
---
Im still enjoying some parts of the game,but sadly,game is indeed in sustain mode. not even  100000 QOL changes gona made up for lack of content.
---
Soulbeast with with the elite + healskill already gave 20 stacks stab before the patch  right? Wats new now?
---
I'm too ambivalent and pessimistic at this point to give it a second thought.
---
I couldn't play this game without one.
---
all keys that are not from official retailers have chance to get you banned, you can't know for sure.
---
Where to get a cape??
---
Just want a legendary Fractal Cape to go with my ad infinitum... Oh and please ANET make it stretch longer than my kitchen towel... :(
---
I personally dislike all guild skins due to the emblem being forced on them.
---
Hoping that the devs implement something to let us use that as a cape pattern as well. Same for the sunspear design and the Joko design. Even if it's just a texture on the existing model.
---
Merely revenants going SuperNova 80x times
---
I dont "get" this achievement too..
---
Boss ports, turn camera, see snow behind pillar, take a step in his direction, Beastmaster GS skill 3 without lock on. Already damage him again, WHILE the yellow qualifier icon is still there, dont get achiev, dissappointment. Everytime.
---
But it also occasionally rubs all over your internal organs.
---
Well it's not just QOL updates that'll save the game, we definitely hefty content updates and PvP/WvW needs some major attention. My only point is that if you believe it's far too late for Anet to save the game at this point, then it's probably best for you not to hang on anymore. Or, at least just play what little you enjoy, but try not to put a damper on other peoples hopes. Afterall, there are many that still enjoy the game too, so QOL updates like this are a mega bonus for them.
---
For the record, I didn't downvote you. I 100% understand peoples frustration with the game/company. But quips that don't add to conversation do get downvoted quite heavily on this site. Don't let it get to you, it's very clear from the many threads that pop up all the time that many others share your same view or at least a part of it.
---
This is definitely a step in the right direction. Still a lot of work to do but bravo on the hard work devs. Anet now all you gotta do is start giving us some real talk on your future plans. That would greatly help settle a lot of people.
---
Looks bad after stopping vs Looks bad standing still. Chose your poison.
---
There are two types of guild armor so hopefully we will have choices of capes too!
---
It reminded me of the Reznik's story (World of Warcraft): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJutEAGiOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awJutEAGiOs)
---
It's so sad. I'm also like to exploring secret and under map places and don't understanding why game companies don't allow it when it's using not for cheating.
---
Alt was bound to see friendlies for me, in WvW I would use it to direct my heals or guardian boonspam, combined with having my F skills bound to my mouse, so it wasn't hard to press both together accidentally.
---
A lack of hand-hand coordination. Hah.
---

---
Capes, the repeatable, engaging content we were all waiting for.
---
I just realized my one punch man cosplay finally got something to finish it out.
---
A good quality of life patch today, a nice content patch a matter of weeks ago, some seasonal fun ahead :3
---
All these years later and I still love this game and despite all the negativity on Reddit, I'm still hopeful for GW2's future.
---
I agree with precision infusions that there should be an pptional build without infusions and I have brought this up a couple of times already to have multiple options.
---
For rankings of class, whenever someone asks what class they should play I always reply with " the class that you enjoy the most". I dont know many people that actually just try to copy the top class because its "highest damage". Most people play what they like.
---
For bench numbers, last time I checked there is also an average next to the bench number but sure. Also, I cant reply to those people saying fuck off since we represent a guild in game that some people look up to. Saying fuck off to someone would smear that reputation.
---
Im sorry for you that you dont like weapon stowing or aftercast, but its a part of the game and we can use it to increase our damage, others can use it to increase their damage and thats it. If you dont like the mechanic dont use it, come to our public discord and ask for a quick bench without stowing and cancelling after cast and I will be happy to make one.
---
For hitbox dependent skills like warhorn air 5 and warrior gs3 I cant help you there. If its a skill with multiple hits with movement and you dont realise you should position to get more hits in even when they do it in the bench I cant help with that. If you have questions about why your bench is lower you can always go to the public discord and ask for general mistakes.
---
For buffs, give me a single benchmark that uses AP or pinpoint distribution. I highly doubt there are any and if there are I would be happy to have them removed and redone.
---
The other class that has a number with allies is renegade I think, but thats not even the bench number
---
i like my cape, more child like depending on your design.
---
Ith?
---
&gt;	They wouldn't do this. It would prevent stacking infusions which is the primary reason many of them retain their value.
---
“Hold my beer.” - Anet Dev, probably
---
You can buy ghostly infusions from glenna for 1000 shards and 20 gold, after defeating gorseval.
---
I've seen exactly 0 people using capes. It seems that all the "players" talk about them on reddit but don't log-in.
---
Is that only in wing 1 glenna's shop? I havent noticed that before
---
&gt; ...why are evades and invulns the only thing that is actually defensive...
---
Is this a joke?
---
I think yes, check her on the crashed airship in w1.
---
Maybe it wouldn’t require them to disclose the reasons why they issued the suspension, but it could reveal notes on the account, such as “caught using Cheat engine or similar program on x date” and it’s a simple guess from there. If their notes on the account are false, then GDPR might afford the right to fix it, and remove the suspension.
---
&gt; For bench numbers, last time I checked there is also an average next to the bench number but sure.
---
Yes, that's why I said you "show peak number much **more prominently** than average".
---
&gt; I cant reply to those people saying fuck off since we represent a guild
---
In that case reply to them to bring up their concerns in an official form with the guild, and provide recorded evidence. :D
---
&gt; For hitbox dependent skills ... I cant help you there.
---
&gt; If its a skill with multiple hits ... I cant help with that.
---
But you can. By explicitly pointing that out in the rotation, or at least in the guide.
---
&gt; I would be happy to have them removed and redone.
---
I will keep that in mind. The videos I'm talking about would be a few years old by now, and some of them might not even have been recorded by SC members, yet featured on the build.
---
Infusion effects is one of the reasons I left gw2. Tbh I'd consider coming if they removed the eye raping blinding infusions or atleast made it so i could force toggle them off from my screen
---
I kept trying to turn off pieces, but find I use almost all the ui elements almost all the time, and turning off stuff in combat or out of combat...turns out I refer to it even during those times.  
---
For instance:
---
I wanted to turn off my skill bar out of combat, but I actually refer to the skill bar often outside of combat for exploration skills or for preparing the skills for the fight.
---
I wanted to turn off chat during combat, but I keep missing what people are saying during the fight and usually glance down at the chat box to see what they said.
---
I wanted to turn off the stuff in the upper-right, but running between targets during an event I need that active to see the status of the event.
---
I wanted to turn off the mini-map during combat, but even during events and fighting I need it to know if I'm heading in the wrong direction away from the event if it's not obvious (which it isn't always).
---
I like the improvement, but honestly I haven't yet found a situation where turning any piece of it off actually helps or improves my playing.
---
But I want my entertainment :(
---
Skyscale is LS4
---
Yes please. I finally bought the ghostly infusion after wanting it for so long. I play only Asura. You can’t see that infusion on Asura... wish I knew that.
---
I like this idea but also think that it won't go over very well if people can't stack their infusions as they like. Perhaps just give people the option to have multiple affects on at once but give everyone else the option to not view player infusions at all.
---
You're looking for a joke that doesn't exist.   
---
\-\_-  
---
 "While we cannot add dye channels to existing backpieces, keep an eye  out for dyeable backpacks of different styles in the future!"
---
It's something they developed for capes for the first time. If it was possible before, I'm sure they would have been dyable at release.
---
Imo it would be weird to show average and then peak. I guess this is a matter of taste though.
---
I honestly would be surprised if it didnt say this anywhere below the video in the rotation section or in the class guides. But anyway, if you cant reach bench and you dont know why its always better to ask.
---
For the videos that are a few years old, I was not part of the guild back then and I have no idea which ones have wrong buffs, but there was 1 person that tried to cheat the bench with writs which has since been removed and from that point on we always provide a log in the description now (and sometimes hover over gear and food though I forget that sometimes). I am pretty sure though that pinpoint distribution used to be part of the buffs. EA used to be strange to add since tactics condi bs died and noone played core anymore, but lately tactics power berserker has become meta again and you can see it is being run in records now.
---
We should wait for someone from anet to post some more information about this case. There might be more to it. I'm not saying that OP is guilty but we already saw cases where ppl said they got banned wrongfully (but it turned out that there were more to it) in the past so we really shouldn't jump the gun again. It could be that he is really innocent (then he should get his account back immediately) or he could hide some stuff. In case he got really just banned because he broke out of the map then it is definitely wrong to ban him because someone from anet stated that it's ok as long as we don't abuse it to gain stuff (e.g. progress for map completion).
---
This is why we need new legendary capes
---
There's a wiki guide too, and it comes with 100% less malware/adware!
---
Welp, time to dust off the old launcher
---
Now for moveable and resiable ui elements.
---
How many parking tickets should we give to innocent people? 5%, is 10% acceptable? Because we may already be there and not even realize it. 
---
System that denies access to product you own should move towards clarity and accountability - especially if it was proven to be flawed in the past.
---
With that stance, I'm worried the opposite side might have some brown streaks.
---
&gt; Just try justifying weapon stowing to me. Just fucking try. It's completely unintended. If it was intended, it would be called "cancel aftercast" instead of "stow weapon".  
---
&gt;Not a great way to begin your argument.
---
Nice self diss my dude. 
---
And how do you know what anet intends and what they dont intend? I believe game devs always try to give players a base to play a round with and give them a chance to come up with nice mechanics/use of game mechanics. 
---
There is no way of knowing what anet intends or not intends if they dont state their opinion, so please stop spreading bullshit like its facts.
---
This is how most advancements in tech work. The best you can hope for is retroactive changes, but those don't happen very often in the case of skins.
---
Don’t buy keys from unofficial channels and yes you can be banned once there is a fraud report on the credit card that was stolen to buy the key and then Anet loses money and terminates the key
---
What country are you from?
---
&gt; because the User Agreement gives them full right to do whatever they want to any player.
---
Pretty sure this is the case with every game, since you don't own your account.
---
This... happens all the time. I’m confused. Do you think parking tickets are a perfect science or something? In fact it’s a perfect comparison. 
---
City gives you a parking ticket. You really have no means to fight it, and unless you manage to raise enough of a stink you are punished. 
---
If you truly want to overturn the ticket, you can take part in the months long process of fighting the ticket, with little to no control over the timeline, or the information available to you. 
---
And the final say is in the hands of the same government that handed you that ticket to begin with.
---
Cant be dyed fail
---
Something something, the code is old, no one wants or feels its necessary to update, color channels and artwork for every other piece. Basically the same excuse for the last 4-5 years, but if they had started back then, it’d probably be done by now, or at least maybe a successor? But it’s an mmo, if you update the engine/framework/??? you don’t need a GW3 just expats and such to further develop the story/world.
---
This is a small thing, but it’s the same small thing spread out to a bunch of game aspects. The more new stuff is added the more the old stuff feels old. The guru(s) behind the original code have left, but if they were really good that their job the code would have been written to a standard with proper descriptions meaning anyone with similar or enough expertise could have taken over. So they may have been ‘good’, but they cut corners it sounds like, which is good organization and descriptors is at a minimum tantamount to making good working code. Eventually the proverbial can needs to stop getting kicked down road to be someone else’s problem. It’s reached a point where new hardware is coming out that can’t even use the game to its full potential. Hell even the most badass hardware cannot even run the game with max settings at decent frame rates. So why have options if I can’t reasonably enable them without hamstringing myself.
---
Crap! I bought the one from the gem store without realizing that there was a "free" one. 
---
Oh, well. Half of why I did it was to encourage this sort of behavior, so I don't really regret it.
---
Y e s
---
^this
---
I agree, the real spicy stuff comes after someone from anet says their thing officially
---
Lol, the low expectations some players have amuses me...
---
I’m just pointing out that systems like these are in place... everywhere. Because alternatives are expensive, and difficult to deal with.
---
And bogus parking tickets happen, just not crazy often. It really depends on the city though, some places just don’t care enough.
---
What is elite about pve?
---
Y'all think the anet effects design team or whatever is just salty that people don't like their designs 100% of the time and refuse to address public opinion or is it another mom's spaghetti code issue?
---
INB4 I know this is a joke.
---
I imagine this would get implemented like every other legendary thing this would only be applicable to one dye channel on one piece of armor, so they’d end up requiring players to make like 20 ‘legendary’ dyes.
---
&gt; Imo it would be weird to show average and then peak.
---
Imo it's much more weird to show peak number that might have only been achievable due to some extremely lucky circumstances.
---
It would be nice to have those distribution-less weapons from PvP lobby in raid training area, but ANet won't do that, fearing the risk of players managing to carry them out of that map. Would also be a problem with players slotting in sigils and having them be destroyed.
---
&gt; I am pretty sure though that pinpoint distribution used to be part of the buffs.
---
Well then someone clearly didn't get the memo, because when I saw that it really stuck out for me for either being out of season (pinpoint) or odd to have in the first place (presence) and I double checked that other builds weren't using it. But that won't help me recall which exactly was that video from years ago.
---
&gt; but lately tactics power berserker has become meta again and you can see it is being run in records now
---
Any warrior player, who hasn't completely lost their dignity after being forced for years to play banners and EA and being "endearingly" called a "slave", wouldn't go back to playing tactics. But you are playing a different game from the rest of the raiders. Pardon, average raiders.
---
   
---
I also have the same problem that you do not know what to do
---
I have to hard-agree here. As someone who did every single raid and assorted rewards from each (armor and ring), I was honestly disappointed by just how SHEER EASY Boneskinner was. Really, all you need is a single healer and all mechanics become worthless to do, because all you need to do is DPS the boss to death while getting heals. The torches going out hardly causes a problem because of the heals.
---
SAITAMA!
---
Yes, quoting a blatant statement made by itself is taking it out of context. /s
---
&gt; ...my point, as per the entire comment was that stability arguably doesnt do what it is meant to anymore...
---
...and what would that be, in your world? Pure immunity to ccs for a given duration with no counterplay?
---
I'm curious: how much PvP do you actually do, and what would you say your average rating is? Also, do you think your rating is accurate?
---
And you are..?
---
Rearranging the menus takes a few minutes, while adding multiple levels would require some active development.
---
A PvP with gold badge is not elite either ;)
---
Isn’t that yellow card just the icon for Flash from League of Legends?
---
Well I have **both**.
---
Unrelated, but still sad they didn't add categories for Dry Top and Silverwastes :(.
---
can't refute and turn to insulting. pathetic.
---
Poobadoo and Trillia are also not too difficult to solo either.
---
Same is happening in the Mistlock Sanctuary.
---
Well, the wing backs got glider versions.
---
Never say never.
---
Because you would have to pay someone to do the work?
---
I think its more about the effects team being told not to work on something like this because they are being paid to work on something else since the time and testing will take up time from what is profitable. 
---
If "salty" is involved, its probably towards not being able to do anything about it.
---
So I know anet doesn't post a schedule for items to be listed.. was this datamined or was the info gathered elsewhere?
---
I would take largo's as the example of having to know mechanics tbh. The enrage check is 35-40k. You can literally have this with the most brainless group as long as they dont die/face tank attacks. Yet I see people getting knocked by tornadoes, explosions and down to dashes 24/7 in pugs
---
Oh but I did refute, and where is that insult?
---
If only we could sit in chairs **while** wearing a cape **and** take out a fishing rod and play a fishing minigame, all at the same time...
---
A man can only dream.
---
"a few bugs and some balancing" instead of "it's completely broken" speaks volumes about how close the current difficulty is to the intended.
---
If the difficulty was intended to be anywhere near what "Elite PvEers" wish it was, this would've been an all-hands-on-deck disaster with hotfixes released within hours (up to 1 day AT MOST) of boneskinner going live.
---
Closest thing is the guild cape and the guild emblem, right now.
---
/r/Angryupvote/
---
yes. pure immunity for CCs for a given duration. you use a skill with a long CD for the express purpose of being immune to CCs. like a second to guarantee a skill. not pop stability, instant boonstrip CC chain dead. that doesn't have counterplay and is even less fun then playing against someone that actually got a healing skill off in the middle of a CC condi bomb. otherwise why bother. the idea of windows or opportunity has been lost. they have stab? it will be gone soon. wait it out. warrior has endure pain up. dont waste your burst. there should be times when people have to know not to waste skills.
---
We base our results on optimal comps and such. We can't cater to everyone in this game because we don't get paid for doing any of this, we spend our free time on making benches to help the community with rotations. If we see it fit to have EA on the bench because we use it in our daily runs then we have no reason to remove them from the bench. And even if we see a reason to do this it would not matter if you try to hit the bench since you can just use EA yourself. Its still a lot more realistic than what LN does in their buffs.
---
Glad to hear so! I look forward to it!
---
Instead of killing everyone, make it take 5 times longer to kill.
---
"Computer stuff you wouldn't understand."
---
... You got a response... then edited your post (removing everything you originally had) now that you got a response...
---
And some lackluster legendaries got updated.
---
I think it was intended for strikes to be doable with ten leechers pressing 111111.
---
They should at the very least work on making legendary backpieces dyeable
---
I used it ... for a few seconds them immediately swapped back after looking at it in the combat stance
---
I have to replay all the story again so I can recreate all the screenshots I took before, but with a _CAPE_
---
I think the second fight is about right for NORMAL strikes.
---
But if they want to engage us then we need challenge versions.
---
Datamined, if you can call it that. File in %temp%/gw2gibberish/something/~500kb file
---
I checked. Personal data defined in the GDPR specifically includes any information “relating” to a natural person, including that data linked to an online identifier (e.g. account name, character name).  There is no allowance for “reasonably connected to” here. It’s a strict compliance standard and “any” information is pretty dang broad. See Article 4.
---
Regardless of whether A-Net thinks they would have to turn it over or not, if I were protected by the GDPR and this happened to me, you bet I would file the request and seek to enforce it to the most liberal possible interpretation.
---
You responded with basically "no u", can't you see that? I'm sorry, but even you can be wrong, an no amounts of "no u" can change that.
---
But hey, downvote this comment as well if it's cathartic for you, I don't mind.
---
&gt; ...pure immunity for CCs for a given duration...
---
Oh boy!
---
Either you haven't been playing this game long enough, or you don't know what good balance looks like...or both.
---
&gt; ...like a second to guarantee a skill...
---
I see...
---
&gt; ...they have stab? it will be gone soon...
---
So, you want a second to guarantee a skill, but then complain that a second is not long enough...I see.
---
&gt; ...there should be times when people have to know not to waste skills...
---
...and what do you think people that wait on using their skills, so they can counterplay your stability do?
---
You are giving a VERY strong vibe that you have no idea what you actually want, nor are you any good at PvP. No offense, but you are not the type of individual ANet should be taking advise from when it comes to balancing the game.
---
I don't think you know how closing threads works on reddit.
---
Pretty suspicious.
---
&gt; "you and another account were both found 'flying' in wvw"
---
You infiltrated their secret weapons development facility and tested the upcoming air force for WvW? xD
---
People who’ve collected and stacked the same expensive auras would be upset.. but I think this would be good for the game.
---
Ooooooor the poster lied.
---
Cause Anet has never done something that has tanked value of items before :P
---
New warrior spec, fists monk inc?
---
&gt; If the difficulty was intended to be anywhere near what "Elite PvEers" wish it was
---
but that was never the case.. they explicit said, it should be stepping stones into raids. 
---
as raider i dont know how those clownfiestas should help to get into raids, but on the other hand (i wouldnt believe it until it happened to me) people are actually able to fail those.. says a lot about the avg skill of the community
---
GMs went and saw you flying out of bounds in wvw and you're still trying to fight this?
---
New warrior elite? fists monk inc?
---
at least I had 10 minutes of fun with my auric infusion and sold it for 100g more xD
---
I have both, and would love to hide them as they’re way too flashy for me.
---
Man anet cant do anything without you people asking for more and not even bothering to commend them what they've done.
---
No, your team needs that to know to stay close. 
---
like staying in chrono wel.... 
---
I can't even finish that.

That was an email sent to a guildmate of this guy I think?
---
I'm not sure why it's really relevant here.
---
actually implying a single arrow is an upgrade over the original effects. do you even play dragonhunter? do you even have a legendary lb? you either are blind or have a taste that needs an upgrade.
---
Yeah, why would he fight a \*temp\* ban so hard if it wasn't a mistake?  Either they got some wires crossed and fucked something up or are targeting him out of spite for his guild affiliation.
---
The Desolation has done its job, then. It's clearly meant to be a place everyone despises.
---
Even back in GW1 people would abhor the Desolation maps, both because the scenery and the enemies in them.  
---
Of course, it also made better the feeling of Vanquishing those maps and overcoming their hardships. But in GW2 map completion isn't as hard as GW1's Vanquishing, so it isn't as fulfilling.
---
The dark red on your health bar, it shows you the cost there too :o
---
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, because of this in particular:
---
&gt;Moreover u can get them with kwyfarming too if u do not want to pay
---
As you can't really keyfarm the mount license mounts or a lot of the stuff in the gemstore.  Even still, that's just 52 keys a year since it's locked behind a weekly cooldown.  Anyways, ANet makes way more than necessary to keep the servers running that the predatory methods of keys and other random elements in the store along with slicing up QoL features into multiple methods of monetization isn't necessary.
---
It stretches into infinity when moving around.  It's more rubberband than cloth.
---
While they're at it, add a show/hide to the boots and change the invisible slippers into something else, since adding that feature isn't impossible anymore.
---
The whole game is pink encounter!
---
Whole GW2 can be described with 2 words: "wasted potential" :P And capes unfortunately fits into it too.
---
And finally let us use Winter's Presence with an outfit.
---
One of the best QoL updates ever! I didn't know I missed automatic build swapping this much. Swapping builds with hotkeys after entering gamemode became automatic reflex, so it is now hard *not* to press those buttons. Also I have to remember to swap back to my "default" PvE/WvW build *before* leaving gamemode (if I happen to use some another build). This is very minuscule inconvenience. Guess it is part of my brain's though process to have certain "default" settings for everything. Didn't have that before update, I just quickly pressed hotkeys *after* changing gamemode. No problem.
---
Weapon swapping for ele and engi is one of the best QoL things ever. I can now play sword/dagger/staff weaver AND scepter/warhorn/dagger tempest on same character. Same with engi, I can now play sword/pistol/rifle holo AND hammer/rifle scrapper on same character. No need to double-click on weapons in inventory with these characters anymore. Also, more free inventory space!
---
Capes are cool, but I am afraid of clipping problems and/or strange pre-defined shapes to prevent clipping, especially on charr.
---
Dynamic UI is really nice, though default UI was already pretty minimal. Only thing I would hide is edge screen effects and story journal, but latter seems to hide achievements (dailies) too...
---
Awesome update!
---
I'd be interested in seeing a replay of the supposed events, similar to how Chris Cleary demonstrated was possible earlier https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7rcmjw/had_a_1440_hour_ban_for_third_party_software_use/dsw840o/
---
While the floating balls fit some of my characters' aesthetics, they don't fit them all and I'd love to just swap stats and wear these.
---
What desolation lacks is good meta event with Bone Palace. And I mean good. The bugged escort in Ruptured Heart is hardly engaging.
---
Glad you are resorting to name calling, blaming, projecting and refusing to answer my simple question. Keep writing a book mate you name calling and posting irrelevant information with no sources (may we please get links to the multitude false bans? Hello?) Tells me its straight up emotion and you honestly have nothing to show. I've posted 7 links of true bans, ones which were "I WAS FALSELY BANNED!" With a dev response stating that no, you were rightfully banned. [Link incase you missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e5qg8z/wrongly_banned/f9ls5n9/) if I honestly cared I could dig up another 10 in 10 minutes, I even linked a fuckup proving that yes, the system is not perfect, statistical anomalies do happen (the only one to pop up in my search) you just angrily mash that keyboard and make broad sweeping assumptions about me and my life while saying emotion is not involved ignoring all statistical probabilities that any sane person if looking at the raw numbers would place large bets on "Legitimate ban". Take the emotion out of your posts, back it up with links, sources, anything other than angrily slamming that keyboard while screaming no emotional bias next time and maybe you'll get somewhere. As for this, reply all you want I'm done, I'll save you a bit of time, you are blocked I wont see your next message. Have a nice day.
---
Fully agree. I'd just also like hard-mode variants of the strikes at some point, and/or a better system of rewards for them. If they're not going to actually make new raids at anything approaching industry standard cadence then I'd like to have difficulty modes on the strikes.
---
No the Flash guy is more jumping towards the camera and has a shadow copy behind him. The yellow card's art is substantially different.

---
My guess is that he managed to do this without 3rd party tools. He's then salty that he was banned for something he didn't do (use 3rd party tools), completely missing the point that them guessing the exact situation incorrectly has nothing to do with the fact that he was map breaking in WvW to get an advantage. Somehow he completely missed the last paragraph and most important point: "You cheated by going out of bounds in WvW".
---
I thought so, it would probably be a very lame story if he just finishes off everything with only one punch.
---
Than go eat Sous-Chef Seimur Oxbone's Bloodstone filth...
---
It's bugged.
---
What kind of pvp thief uses p/p?
---
I don't know what you mean by that, but I still find 163rd out of 42399 amazing. My expectation for GW2 was WAY lower, lower than 10000, so I was pleasantly surprised. Be positive!
---
Do this after the encounter is fixed.
---
Technically, he can, he just holds back most of the time.  Though, serious punch is likely to kill anything in a single hit.
---
But we don't know how exactly Anet is going the change the fight. I can only judge what is in the game right now. It's not like the other strike missions are actually hard.
---
hope you learnt your lesson, seems like there's nothing productive coming out of your mouth anymore. next time think before you talk.
---
U never saw a predatory game.
---
For those of you who can't be bothered to actually read everything, the 2nd to last link in the OP explains why he was banned. He was map breaking to avoid enemy players in WvW.
---
&gt;Map breaking in itself is not a problem.  
---
Map breaking to gain an advantage over other players is.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You and another account were both found 'flying' in WvW and escaping enemy players. They reported that you could not be attacked because you escaped out of bounds. Two Game Masters went out to observe and found precisely that.
---
Let's be realistic, people are still going to gatekeep raids no matter what. It doesn't and will never serve as a stepping stone into raids. In order to join a pub raid group they want to know you've killed all the bosses dozens of times. Strike missions have no correlation with actual raids.
---
Plus people like you calling casuals clowns tends to scare off anyone willing to learn a proper boss so there's that.
---
KABOOM!
---
Could you elaborate the bug side of this? As in what is technically a bug in the encounter vs what needs to be tuned up?
---
Getting internal information such as their methods for determining TOS compliance is not data relating to a natural person.
---
honestly if they can figure it out they should let us dye everything we want
---
its not like they arent letting us eyerape people as it is
---
If you bother to read the evidence that the OP linked to, you'll see that ANet not only double-checked this, they verified it at least 3 times. And called out the OP for lying about the circumstances in his original Reddit post.
---
Hahah, good avoidance. You lied twice, and name calling you is bad? If you are a moron you get told you are one, that is how it works. I already replied to your "simple question" btw, you cannot see it is not my fault. Brain injury volume 4.
---
Maybe stop lying or claiming other person is doing x when they are clearly not doing it and people will take you more seriously.
---
You want links of my bans or others? I can do both, i thought they were just known by anyone that comes to this sub regularly. And since you act so full of knowledge how come you don't? :) Sad.

These are just me :) But yes, go ahead and hide your head in dirt and shout lalala.
---
Lol what are you talking about? I don't hate companies, I'm just saying blindly praising companies because of "loyalty" seems very weird to me. You don't owe Anet anything. You're allowed to criticise them because -  *spoiler alert* - Anet doesn't give a shit about you. They just care about your money.
---
&gt; But the impact of gear, lifeskill suits, maids, bank space, pets, ... is absolutely huge. The most skill based fights are, as you outlined, those where both sides can one rota eachother.
---
Costumes are not that important for lifeskilling anymore since we have manos mastery. You can process stuff actively now or cooking outfit isn't that needed (altough it was always more of afk lifeskill). You can buy storage with cp and if it's not enough you can store things in central market storage which is almost unlimited (unless you have a lot of materials or expensive shit). Pets as previously said you get 4 for free now and fifth sometimes appears in attendance rewards. Tier 3 pets are nice, but it's not like you can't grind efficiently at all with tiers 1. Maids are nice, but you can overstack trash loot on horse (like most people do). This game is all about getting better gear so ofc it will have huge impact until softcap - when you can one combo most people. 
---
&gt; If your DR outscales their hitrate they almost literally cant touch or hurt you
---
In 1v1? Yes, but you will also not kill anything. In nodewars? DP almost do shit. Most people go full ap builds till when they get pens on weapons and armors then they go hybrid. It's so late in the game you will never notice this only mostly in nodewars.
---
&gt; Imho, having a reachable hard cap (such as +15 rather than I to V rng grind) would make the game more competitive. Alternatively higher upgrades should have diminished stats.
---
There is softcap - ap levels when you can one combo most people even if they are below or higher than your gs. It's tet weapons and armors and tri accessories and those things are rather easy to get if you spend enough time. 
---
The game changed some much from the start till now it's really different game now. It's like comparing release GW2 where endgame were dungeons and world bosses to today's GW2.
---
You can tell who the white knights are who never bothered to click the links.
---
"you must've done something more" "you wouldn't be banned just by going out of bounds"
---
What does the summary given BY THE GM say?
---
&gt;"To summarise: You cheated by going out of bounds in WvW. That is a severe offence, and as such actioned with a three-month suspension.
---
:/ I know a lot of you people simply LOVE defending everything ANet does like your life depended on it, but come the fuck on. The GM even says this is the reason, yet you guys keep swearing it must've been something else.
---
Oh I did: there are always idiots about to harass devs, idiots that prefer to get all angry about nothing instead of growing and improving.
---
Oh well, not my problem.
---
Is that what the sheet tied round your neck allowed you to do?
---
You're right.
---
They shouldn't say anything at all and leave it up to our imagination.
---
"Escaping enemy players"
---
And even the bug doesn't apply everytime because he wiped us twice yesterday because his mechanic worked for my group.
---
Warrior Elite Spec when?
---
remindme! 8 hours

I have even had people argue with me that they didn't need to grab red essence first for the breakbar.  Just because you don't have it doesn't mean your group doesn't.  Normal skills hardly even scratch the breakbar.

|-|-|-|-|
---
We actually had that kill my group twice last night. I was surprised because the fight was actually legit challenging at first.
---
this is too good
---
i honestly wouldnt recommend any raid newbie to join a pug. get a traininggroup and get into a static. hell, get into a static no matter what. pug raids are really horrible.
---
also i didnt call casuals clowns, i called the strike mission a clown fiesta, because it teaches basicly nothing. i guess you project your own thinking about casuals onto my sentence.
---
Again there with the mirror? Come on, we've been over this already!
---
And titties and beer. Lots of beer.
---
I dont like the floating, re-shaping piece of poop in a bubble over my head, sorry
---
No, "Unrelenting pain" is the debuff you get from being outside the arena walls. When the Boneskinner respawns when you leave the arena after its defeat, the border bugs out and puts the debuff on everyone in the room. That's the bug.
---
that monitor width... jesus
---
I logged into WoW classic, a 15yo game, on my lvl 2 mage, who had a cape. Seriously, this is what is game changing new content for people?
---
Also, as an aside, you can start the new LS...and then be done with it, in 20-30 mins (2-4 hours if you want to get all the mastery and achi).
---
Well, your name IS "ilovebuttmeat69", kinda hard to take anything you say seriously or without a grain of salt.
---
Crashed Airship in W1, or if you have the portable raid shop item. Also with Gaeting crystals wing 7 glenna has the peerless infusions, and the 2nd raid shop item thing (I cant remember the exact names hahah)
---
Even if Anet doesn't allow it, you can still make a homebrew.
---
What do you mean specifically by group content because that's a lot of things in gw2 unless you mean all of it.
---
One Punch!!!
---
What are you talking about? Are you aware the OP completely replaced the original post with the new information from the GM? All the "white knights" you see posting stuff like that was before the GM responded...
---
I also really want to know. Can't think of any weapon animation etc having a similar movement
---
but gw1 also had them clipping. Except there having a gold trim was something. here it's nothing. or rather 600 gems or so
---
That's not true, check the wiki.
---
One minor change I'd like is for the Festivals tab to be moved to the top during a festival (and back down when none are happening) otherwise people end up flooding Central Tyria with their LFG posts, largely ignoring the appropriate section.
---
Adding +80% damage reduction to boss, would be a good idea.
---
Maybe it's Rampage's autoattack animation? Or something like Wild Blow with no weapon equipped?
---
Due to the extra concentration via mobility potions, I run a mix of Harrier's and Zealot's gear for the (admittedly marginal) extra DPS. Others might use Cleric's or Magi's but I say, “Meh. If the party *needs* that extra minmaxed healing, then I probably don't want to run with them anyway.”
---
Right? We don't need sleep, we need answers.
---
Instanced group content is as good as dead at this point. Studio's main focus at the moment is open world and story. There is grind but it is "endgame" and "optional" so you will not encounter it for some time.
---
In which time zone do you live?
---
.....the entire POINT of GW2 is that 99% of everything you're doing is group content.
---
There's no way you've had a reddit account for 5 years and you still think usernames are indicative of anything.
---
Come on man no need to be that hyperbolic, enjoy the changes, they are heading in a good direction.
---
Sorry Arenanet, but you're wrong in this and this is an absolute bullshit punishment. Our guild generally does WvW for two events a week and as someone who was there during this time, no one in our guild or otherwise was "flying" anywhere. The closest thing any of us could do to that is the gliding you put into WvW. You've really soured me and a lot of us on our trust in your customer support and caring about your long-time players if you're willing to write any of us off this easily, and right before Wintersday even.
---
I seriously doubt you had two GMs watching mesmer or anyone else in WvW considering how obvious it is you don't pay any general attention to the game mode as a whole and you certainly don't pay any attention to reports about the map/team chat there.
---
You don't even need a healer.. just 10x DPS and u'll be fine :D
---
Nah adding dmg reduction wouldn’t teach people anything, they will just be like “Oh, why is my dps only 1k? Whatever, I will keep spamming 1”. Best would be to wipe the whole party so they know that is a LETHAL attack if they don’t step in green.
---
Except the same people also don't see the purpose of assigning those things to human characters and frequently complain about that, too
---
EVERY. DAY.
---
always assumed that was his dead buddy, as Bright Shores is still kinda around to sell that trinket
---
but maybe thats just the map time-freeze
---
&gt;(2-4 hours if you want to get all the mastery and achi).
---
LOL
---
Lmao okay
---
Last night I was crashing constantly, in small scale fights on EB.
---
We took turns with WSR crashing on FSP BL though, when it came to larger fights, but none when there were 3 way fights earlier on in the night.
---
&gt; But a golden Ad Infinitum has been a long requested feature.
---
From a technical standpoint you can't create that gold look with dyes. It would have to be a brand new skin with that special material. To anyone seeing this comment in isolation, I don't know what will and won't be happening. I'm just purely talking how stuff is made.
---
Honestly, the change seems way too late in the game’s history to make an impact. There are too many back pieces that we want to see dyable.
---
This is pretty much something that really pissed me off before I stopped playing. All the good looking stuff was gem srore only. And if you wanted to buy it with gold, you probably needed to grind 10+ hours of content you didn't necessarily enjoy. There comes a moment where you just no longer give a fuck about cosmetics. My wallet is done with the game.
---
Rampage comes with visual effects
---
* Starting zones are lively only because of people making new characters
---
* WvW is dead outside of prime time and even then it can be server/matchup dependent
---
* PvP has few players at higher tiers so you'll match either the same players over and over again or play lopsided matches
---
* In EU Raid LFG is OK during prime time but NA Raid LFG is virtually nonexistent
---
* Fractals are lively around reset especially at higher tiers
---
* Dungeons are dead content
---
* Most players farm the most profitable meta events and maps plus whatever the newest map is to get the map currency
---
If you want to time sink this game you will basically just be farming the same maps or meta events over and over and over again since there isn't much else to do
---
Ah the classic "Don't see it, Didn't happen."  
---
You sure shut me up.
---
There's a very good reason WP said Guild Wars 2 is "play alone, together."  There may be other people around you during those events but you barely, if ever, need to actually interact with them and most of the content in this game can be done solo
---
Capes: *exists*
---
GW2: *Saitama Wars 2*
---
I think the best solution I've seen to this, so far, has been giving players a slider bar to adjust the scaling of the article of gear in question, along with limited control of the x/y/z of where on the model it hangs from.  (Warframe, for instance, has this level of control for where your weapons hand from your back/belt/etc.)  This is, of course, my opinion.  Just tossing it out. :P
---
Check his post history, dude's a human saltmine and needs everyone to be as miserable as he is.
---
Thanks for the info ! 
---
From a technical standpoint, could that backpack be dyed tho ? Just technically speaking, no special color like gold involved.
---
I'm really curious about all that stuff ! Seems super interesting to know how things work lol. Would be nice to have a behind the scene like we had for raids for exemple :D 
---
But yeah I know some stuff should be kept secret :3
---
It's a good game casually, but something like Path of Exile will be a lot better at consuming large amounts of time.
---
The main content type of the game since it's release is now "filler". Fucking amazing.
---
lmao, okay.  Totally never played any mobile games.  Keep making up assumptions, pal.
---
Do anet know?
---
Yeah, it's kind of weird how a studio with 200+ people let everything die except their main content. I mean, I can understand it on a certain level, but where are all the man-hours going? Is LS such a drain? Quite odd.
---
Well, at least her corpse got fisted by Jormag to make her a talking puppet.
---
Wait, no, that's not a good thing...
---
Can't monetize it.
---
They wouldn’t want to have an option to turn off infusions because the current big ticket items on the market are the shiny infusions. If they implemented an option to turn it off, it would devalue the infusions and people wouldn’t pay as much for them if they knew folks could just turn it off on their end.
---
With that being said I’d really like to see that change happen. Too many people running around with 5 of every infusion stacked and I can barely see what’s going on in large scale group content.
---
Sad to say but this is an accurate description.
---
I don't have the numbers between how many people playing, and how many are actually buying expansions. So cannot tell you if selling expansions is worth enough.
---
Getting reddit platinum, gold and silver for breaking gw2subreddit rules. All it takes are some pretty screenshots. ez.
---
I bet you you are looking forward to next tuesday sales
---
That's a pretty long-winded way to call it a ded gaem.
---
"Oh, so you think the raid mechanics and enviroment is your ally? But you merely adopted the raid. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn’t see PvE content until I was already a man, by then to me it was only casual. The raid devs betrayed you because they belong to me!"
---
GW2 has as much or as little grind as you want it to have. You can grind your brains out for years, especially as a new player, if that's what you're into. Or you can be done within minutes, if you don't do high level Fractals (GW2's progression dungeon system).
---
Group content is fine, although if you want WoW-level of instanced PvE content, you ARE going to hit a huge fucking wall within months of getting BiS gear. This game is more about story, exploration and casual gameplay.
---
Guten Tag sN,
---
Despite the usual ignorance and the forced controversy on legit kills and different styles I think this is a great kill, I am impressed by your dedication and in equal parts by the kill-time!
---
Dont get fooled by any trolls, I think from a sportive perspective you did everything right. Clearly stating what you do and dont and you recorded and showed everything. This way the rules are transparent.
---
Speaking of this: what is your reasoning to not use cc consumables and at the same time use the WMportal? Wouldnt you agree this is another way of adding features/support/versatility on top of the standard profession skills? And in conclusion: if the speedclear community developed distinct rulesets: maybe like 'vanilla' : allowing skills only (including no WM) and 'freestyle' allowing everything including cc and dps conaumables etc.
---
... But at the same time it is maybe overcomplicating things. Just wanted to give this thought a chance to live.
---
Keep up your great gaming!
---
theres no good reason an infusion needs to be worth more than tp cap.
---
Agreed, it was super fun. But lots of fun stuff has been taken away like saving yourself from fall damage with spectral walk.. just got to live with it :(
---
it sucks
---
pvp, wvw, raids and fractals: completely dead, abandoned, customers ignored, feedback ignored, they don't even care
---
pve wise: single player story mode seems to be the main focus right now, which is completely ridiculous, not only because this is a MMOrpg, but because even they can't do that right, last episodes were incredibly short for the amount of time we had to wait for them, and maps have 0 replayability
---
the second main focus is in monetizing the game as much as they can, giving us mediocre quality of life changes, they can't even code correctly because templates for example brought huge amount of bugs, crashes and errors, and they had the audacity to charge us for them, in a really shady way (removing pvp and wvw we had already without even telling us) or adding features that break entire game modes with no thought before release, like how warclaw changed the entire wvw game mode in a bad way making tons of players leave, and adding a band aid way to late in ways some players hated even more
---
tl;tr: i belive they are really close to announcing maintenance mode but they want to grab as much money as they can before it, so thats why they silently lower the quality of the game and the releases, and the amount of stuff per release
---
Is grothmar valley strike mission and the other 2 strike missions from bjora also bugged ? You duo everything
---
Auto what?
---
I put dh traps and alttabbed to switch a song and when i opened the game back the boss was dead already, cool story
---
i mean you're the one saying it's fantasy land or whatever
---
just tired of this reddit "wisdom" about healbrand when it's a garbage build..obviously my opinion, shouldn't need to be stated as such
---
i will ignore the rest of the comment because it's too retarded
---
Not to mention the capes are poorly done, clearly a minmal effort cash grab.
---
looks like someone's been doing 100 pushups, 100 situps, 100 squats, and running 10km every single day
---
&gt;NA Raid LFG is virtually nonexistent
---
For clarity purposes, this is true but that doesn't necessarily mean that the NA raid community is dead.
---
I won't deny that the population is decreasing. That's not even from a jaded veteran's perspective, but pure facts (friends leaving, guilds disbanding). 
---
But you'd be remiss to point out that new players are, if not constantly, slowly but surely filling the holes veterans made. 
---
u/Nediac_ if you're on NA and want to get into raiding, join the Raiders Academy. You'll get plenty of help there. They're also going to do an event this weekend, if you're interested.

the only pathetic thing is to dismiss ppl for what they play and like the game for.
---
Yeah, I've seen a few cases of people converting GW2 classes over to 5e.
---
If you mean auto attack also pressing the left alt key I did notice that. Thought it was just my keyboard for a bit because the 1 I have bound on my mouse buttons doesn't trigger the left alt. I only noticed when I started hiding parts of the ui.
---
then can't you see the obvious difference ?

otherwise we'd have "buy this tp item to reduce time to wait for ascended crafting"
---
 &gt;Okay, go back to 2012 level of convenience then. Play any of the new maps with just the stock standard 100 inventory slots and tell me it's not annoying to have to stop at a merchant every 10 minutes as your bags are full. Nothing in this game is necessary. 
---
belive it or not most of my 12 characters do not even have all 20 slot bags.
---
u can survive without
---
&gt; Then they can do it in a way that doesn't just siphon money from the whales.
---
ok tell me one.

Man u really should get laid or something... I don't know why are you so mad about stuff that doesnt affect you at all...
---
Well, it shrinks your epeen because pretty much anyone can do your "hardcore elite content" but well... If you don't want that maybe go play a game that requires skill?
---
Also: using retarded as an insult in 2020... Man you are really unlikable... Good thing you don't have the balls to adress people this in real life!
---
I know it’s easy to believe that, but I don’t really think it’s true. I do legitimately think they are trying to ease more casuals into instanced content (whether that’s fractals or raids), but I think they’re being overly cautious. There could have been a bit more of a difficulty bump on this one.
---
I want it back.
---
Yes! A few clearly telegraphed, lethal mechanics would be a huge improvement.
---
Which one? The non-existent one or the one no one does anymore because it's abandonware.
---
I'd love to be able to hide my SAB infusion effects. They're fun every once in a while but generally just break my immersion. I even keep another set of rings on me without the effect. 😔
---
Nope still working on my end
---
Yes. This is a misconception among many people yelling for people to use more CC. It’s not just CC you need, you need to buff properly before the fight.
---
Looks like mods caught wind
---
&gt; The torches going out hardly causes a problem because of the heals.
---
What torches?
---
yeah I'm on an i7-6700k, so a little bit older :)
---
Yeah, that's pretty common, even non-gemstore skins. Like the Order of Whispers weapons unfold when drawn, and such. It's also not new to the gemstore either, Kasmeer's staff, Marjory's axe and dagger, the Plasma weapons, etc.
---
A dev actually responded to one of the first topics about this that at the very least, there are bugs and there is a balancing issue.
---
That not being fixed in 3 days means it might just not be that trivial to fix(or just dont want it to be a crappy rushjob) and that theyre probably aim to have a fix for it by the time its in rotation again
---
Agreed. They have said before that the difference in effectiveness of the most skill players and the least skilled is extreme, and as a game designer you DO NOT WANT that. It makes it very, very hard to satisfy a wide swath of players, and that leads to inefficient development.  
---
How successful their attempts have been to fix this are what we can pass judgment on, but saying they aren't trying is ridiculous. They are more aware of the problem than any of us ever could be since they get to see the actual data from the playerbase.  
---
All that said, I completely agree that they need to challenge players more. Kodan were great because they had really narrow mechanics that were very punishing to mess up, but very easy once you understood how to play. That's the best way to increase player skill in my opinion.
---
Cannot login to test it, but wild guess: have you changed your "Show all ally names" keybind from left Alt?
---
Same. When I submitted a ticket for it the response I got was "yep we know" and the ticket was closed
---
I guess it depends on what you want to do and how you want to play. For me there is never a shortage of stuff to do with my guild between raids, fractals, dungeons, guild arena, guild missions, meta events, and WvW. I never pug so I guess my view may be a little different from someone who depends on lfg for group content. 
---
The game is free after you buy the xpacs so what’s the worst that can happen? If you get bored can always go back to WoW with the next expansion.
---
- Reaper = Power
---
- Scourge = Support _or_ Condi
---
- Future e-Spec = Condi _or_ Support
---
That is my hope. 
---
Currently Scourge fills the support role more than Condi (Boonstrips &amp; Barrier) which ain't that great for PvE.  
---
But this made it OP in WvW. With the most recent patch that is changing (the halving of the target count on sand savant et al) So we'll have to find out where this settles.
---
Condi scourge was fun, but so was Condi reaper back in the day.
---
A lot of vets on this sub seem to be determined to talk the game down. My perspective as a reasonably (\~ 6 months) new player is that the population seems fine. To clarify, I am talking about open world content here.
---
I haven't tried raids and doubt I ever will after reading Reddit. I dislike PvP content as a game mode so likely will not participate in that or in WvW which is really just mass PvP. 
---
Like anything my answer is : it depends on what things you like to do and what content you enjoy. If you are the kind of person who considers themselves to be hard core and who enjoys high end competitive content, then what someone else says might have more benefit for you. 
---
If you enjoy open world content from a somewhat completionist point of view then this game has enough to keep you busy for years. I am really enjoying myself, and never feel like there is no one around.
---
lmao you are legit retarded though..look at the shit you say
---
The ones around the arena. Them going out makes the boss pulse torment and all of them going out SHOULD be a major problem.
---
The irony of the story is that he's a guy who wins too easily and is therefore bored in life.
---
He even has a dream where he's getting his ass kicked and reveling in it, until he wakes up.
---
His struggles are not generally the people he fights, but rather the fact he does not get any accolades and is overseen.
---
His 'sidekick' is actually higher ranked than he is because everyone assumes he cheated on the physical portion of the placement exam (he broke all records) and failed the written exam.
---
He's been slowly climing the ranks, but only meets with the top class of heroes because his sidekick brings him along.
---
i respect that decision.
---
Tangled Depths would like to have a talk with your perspective
---
To be fair, there were players (several in fact) in Reddit just a week or two ago talking about how their enjoyment of the first strike mission got them to start training and raiding. It's definitely working, I just think too many people here in Reddit put everything on the difficulty being the only thing useful for getting new players into raids.
---
Pleeease!
---
You can cut the gold price in half by purchasing it in WvW, you probably have Bages of Honor from achievement chests. Wheb you're strapped for gold, just getting one or two piece like that feels good!
---
Thanks for the tip!! I will check on that.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e5qg8z/wrongly_banned/f9nehut/
---
I disagree. Having more power options that change playstyle, such as more cleave/aoe damage vs more single target damage gives you more power options for different scenarios. Many more ways can be thought of to change up a playstyle while keeping a trait line primarily focused on one damage type. The same could be said for condi and support. Set the main goal for the spec, develop different options to play that specs goal in fun meaningful ways. 
---
&gt;For that matter, it would be pointless to even have both a power and condi elite, since one would end up being better than the other. 
---
No this is not true at all. One would be better than the other for specific scenarios. we already see this for condi vs power.. speaking for pve directly, condi is generally inferior in every way except for long fights or specific raid encounters. Power is way more efficient for open world, dungeons, fractals, raid bosses with short phases.
---
I'd love for this to happen. But more so I'd like the abilities to turn off it as a whole for everyone on my screen. Beautiful as effects might but they can really put a burden on computers. With the computing power Guild Wars 2 requires it's already a strain on most computers. Having the ability to eliminate these kind of graphics for those around me would fare much better then just removing our own.
---
That simplicity is a big part of what keeps the game accessible for more casual players -- theme park oriented systems &amp; gameplay! I think the entire gaming ecosystem has trended away from complex skill systems with larger quantities of skills and instead focuses on the categorization and interactive synergy between skills.  You have less overall skills, but more dynamic interactions.  
---
Whether you're talking offensive, defense, utility, buffing, supporting, healing it really doesn't serve players to have options unless they're competitive or highly specialized.  This is why I still enjoy looking at the skill recommendations for various missions in GW1 because it plays off that sort of flexibility and opens up new opportunities.  
---
The extreme number of builds, quirks and experimentation is one of the reasons I really enjoy playing Path of Exile.  I don't play every challenge league, but it's always really interesting to see what sort of gameplay dynamic that GGG is balancing or re-working to encourage specific types of gameplay.  For example, with the Metamorph league in a few weeks they're focused on archery type play.  
---
On the other hand, I think raw stat buffs such as those that you're talking about are some of the least interesting aspects of a game to balance.  Overall, they're considered "passive" buffs like pinpoint distribution or empower allies in GW2.  I can't really fault the gaming ecosystem for trending towards more active -- skills that do things and combine in quirky ways (eg; a LoL team fight).  
---
... but I do think that quantity plays into variation and replayability.  There are dozens of skill-based builds that I've yet to try in GW1 or Path of Exile, and the permutations are a huge part of what make those sorts of games fun for me.  Elite Specializations work, but they're a "core" feature vs. a tertiary building block such as a skill / gem-link / in Path of Exile or skills in the original Guild Wars.  
---
I sincerely think that Path of Exile is one of the best aRPG games that I've ever played.  It's a really high quality F2P game with an awesome story, an extensive build-tree (FF X Sphere Grid), really cool sort of materia-gem -- support-gem/system and tons of gameplay variation via ascension classes, the labyrinth and whatever new league mechanic they're orienting their game around.
---
You were rightfully banned. If it's against the game's TOS/Rules, then  you deliberately broke them.
---
dynamic ui seems more niche than keybinding options per character imo, and they still did that.
---
He is the reason the Hero's Association exists.  The first person he saved, the little big chin kid, is the grandson of the founder of the HA.
---
It’s fine for open world still. I just came back and it seems like all condi builds have fallen off of META for the most part. Zerker gear is cheap so, I guess I don’t have to get that viper set anymore at least 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
i admire your dedication
---
Necro has a really good mainhand weapon with scepter. The problem is that the offhands, focus, warhorn and dagger, are quite bad.
---
...yea...and gemstore base skins shouldn't be better than legendaries either...but...$$
---
Anet is aware of this, just sit tight
---
The game is still lively. Hop in the water is fine. This sub has been super “Ded Gaem!!” Lately and while it’s not as active as the last xpac release tons of people still play.
---
its a crutch for sure
---
There's a reason they added an option to show/hide your stowed weapons now. Weapons have always clipped with backpacks - it would be nearly impossible (or, at least, not worth the effort) to account for all the potential clipping that can happen between every weapon in the game with every back item.
---
i didnt know that, that sucks
---
eu lfg isnt that great but its not dead
---
I would like to hide the tooltips on the skill bar.  If my mouse glides across  a skill for any reason, suddenly I have a tooltip going up 3/4 of my screen.  Distracting and doesn't look great when you are doing videos.
---
What did you expect?
---
What do you expect? That they ban as soon as you send the report? Bots are banned in waves so that bot developers have a harder time to figure out what triggered the system.
---
Not that Id ever obtain it, but Id like the idea of combining the three legendary backpieces in the MF with the highest tier of this guild cape to make a legendary guild cape.
---
Exactly ;)
---
Just think about it. How would they be doing that? You want WoW capes, where they stick to your body until they reach your butt and then flap around wildly below your waist? Sure, that way your Twilight wouldn't clip through it but then again it would look stupid as hell. And that would basically be buttcapes all over again to be honest, since it wouldn't really be an actual cape from the shoulders to your waist.
---
The moment you have capes and try to have actual "cloth physics" involved you're going to have the capes clipping with everything else on your back since there is *no way* they could have actual realistic collision between a cape and the weapon on your back, sure it would be amazing but, come on, let's be fair.
---
I think they handled it well, and they also gave you the option to hide your weapon if you just can't bear to look at the clipping. Props to anet.
---
It wasn't just Dhuumfire, shade stacking was a thing.
---
Offhand dagger is pretty decent. The problem is that base death shroud has no conditions other than bleeds on 2, and dhuumfire in a really slow auto.
---
Maybe because the skin has to work for all races and all character models. So it is easy to attach them at the back.
---
I don't care what they do to Scourge, I just want that shade nerf reverted. When the player is considered a shade it gives you so much flexibility in how you play and it feels normal. Having to play around static shades is so easy to frustrate the player. Placed some shades but the mob is moving around? Well, enjoy doing less dps. WvW/PvP? They will avoid the shade as its a easy counterplay.
---
People have duo'd raid bosses too.
---
Also, this boss isn't working properly.
---
Where do you find those players, no pug of mine died to boneskinner. All the pugs I did  only had trouble day one with each strike mission, except for boneskinner, but every day I've got gold time pugging and they weren't excited as you said about getting gold. They just said well played guys and leave. Are you making stuff up? Are you gaining anything from this? (I also did thr fraenir strike mission more than once a day just because it looks very cool). Every strike mission I see replies like yours but I never find these turbocasuals you are spekaing of. Are you EU or NA? Just very curious really.
---
&gt; Yes, you can duo or even solo 2(!) raid bosses
---
#It's a *raid* boss
---
It's posts like this which is why we have outfits and floating objects as to have no clipping.
---
&gt; When the player is considered a shade it gives you so much flexibility in how you play and it feels normal.
---
It definitely feels more normal post-nerf to me.
---
It feels good to actually have to use my brain when playing Scourge now. Not surprising since I love playing Ventari Revenant.
---
&gt; Someone used to play ~~SWTOR~~ any other MMO I take it? lol
---
record it and send it to them. not that that is necessarily more effective.
---
As an FYI, if you look at my post, I commented on the generic use of a 3rd party program reason to cover unrelated suspensions.  And the fact that Anet only explained themselves to the OP because this thread got so much traction.  Had it been someone who didn't get attention on Reddit, Anet wouldn't have escalated the appeal internally.
---
Which strike mission? 
---
The first one does require some level of paying attention to the mechanics/patterns or you can easily go down or die (you'll still get credit, but dying and getting credit is hardly fun for people.
---
The first and second ones in the rotation were definitely more difficult and again taught players to watch the patterns/mechanics of the boss.
---
The third one is currently bugged and imbalanced, so I'll judge it after the fixes are in.
---
I don't recall that being a feature in WoW, but, I never really needed/wanted it in WoW, so...may not have noticed. Been so long since  played Warhammer or AoC that I honestly can't recall either having it either. But maybe that's jus' my mem'ry.
---
Which mmos except SWTOR have these? I'm curious :)
---
Yes, I can.  Lootboxes are also predatory bullshit.  So are the mount licenses as they incentivize the better deal being buying all the mounts instead of buying the select few you want in the set.  So are the RNG dye sets for gems.  So is the fact that they sell armor pieces in the gemstore (Despite saying armor is now going to be an ingame reward w hen they swapped to outfits.) and charging more for a set of four pieces than what they used to charge for a whole armor set.  Just because it's not all out predatory bullshit doesn't mean it isn't predatory at all.  It's not a black and white issue.
---
Lol i think he is just angry.
---
What picture? That it took this much effort for them to give the reply they should've first time? 
---
As i said on almost all of my comments, if you cared to read them instead of drooling all over your keyboard and skip reading, you'd notice my problem is with the process itself - regardless of the individual's guilt or innocence.
---
It is simply stupid that we **need** these threads to get real replies. And both guilty and innocent people deserve real replies. 
---
Stop being so thick skulled and try to understand the point. For you it is all about justice boner, for me it is all about the process that is simply put, dumb as fuck and needs a change.
---
Oh please god no, I like my mount wheel un-monetized ty.
---
I don't want to buy mount wheel spots per character.
---
It isnt, character bound keybindings is very complex compared dynamic ui, dynamic Ui has been a feature asked for ages (well, part of it) also, character bound keys aren't really an issue, people who want that flexibility should invest in a gaming setup to be honest. On a side note, buying a gamepad made my life/rotations a lot easier and it's a damn good tool if you want comfort and commodity..
---
I could see weapon and F skill re-arranging being a more flexible solution but then again, niche.
---
Swappable stats is the main draw for legendary...
---
How did it get so high? How does shade stacking increase dps?
---
There's a lot of tweaking that can be done that won't make or break the build, personally i run **Empowering Might** to sustain better might when i'm on axe, i wouldn't swap out of **Writ of Persistence** because it helps with passive healing and boon uptime but as long as you're keeping boons up it also works just fine.
---
100% agree, the option to turn off effects on legendary trinkets needs to happen. I wanted to have fully legendary equipped toons and realized after setting them up that it ruined my fashion wars so I ended up just putting them in the bank because I don't want bubble float above the head of a toon whose "look" doesn't go with that, but is fully legendary for convenience. It would really be appreciated!
---
hm? nah. it's just there's that meme going around with "_prefix_ thanos _prefix_ thanos". anyway I do exactly the same with the last name sovereign. Haven't had any conflicts at the moment.. heh. no superheroes yet! 
---
how did you come about choosing the name out of curiosity?
---
Might open the way for faster record times on bosses then, although I doubt anything will be higher than 7 scourge epi memes
---
This bug is giving me a *Migraine*!  Definitely not a good way to win *Hearts and Minds*!
---
LS?
---
Gotta get that cheapest micro boosts to dps, fam. /s
---
That said, the effectless +5stat +9agony infusions are more pricey than the ghostly ones iirc.
---
Uh... what the fuck were you expecting? Video games are FAR, FAR from the technology where proper cloth physics won't clip with anything. Like, really? Even in top AAA games, things clip. Clip is 100% unavoidable, you just try your best to always diminish the amount.
---
Oh yeah, we need Potoni the Massive and Emperor Mattake strike duo hehehe.
---
