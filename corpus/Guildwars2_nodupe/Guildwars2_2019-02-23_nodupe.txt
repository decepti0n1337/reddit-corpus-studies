So is political journalism.

---
Both feast on gullible people, blood, sweat and tears though, and are at its core anti-consumer.
---
---
---
I misread your comment - I agree
---
Hopefully you actually did something other than stare at the offline stream.
---
Man a lot of these people saying "Well if you'd just tell us there is no stream today everything would be fine!" are the same people who would still throw a shitstorm if they did. 
---
Lol, even if you work in the gaming industry, you can't look into players mind...
---
What you are writing here is nothing more than baseless assumptions. 
---
For example, I'm german and most german players (I know), especially the older ones, don't want to read the english forum or reddit, because it's english. In the german forum this topic as barely existant, there is only one thread with a few answers. Same in one of the community forums (the one I look at, too), one thread, one answer, that's it. 
---
Also, I play GW2 since beta and played GW1 before. I payed for the game(s), I play the game and I do care about the game, and I started to look into reddit only a bit more than a year ago and use the official forum maybe since HoT and only now and then. 
---
So I absolutely don't fit in what you said. According to your statement I would either don't pay and care about the game at all **or** would have been active in forums since launch. None of them is the case. And I'm definitely not alone. I know many people who don't want to use reddit or even the official forum, but still love the game. 
---
Like I said, baseless assumtions, nothing else.
---
Gamesjournospros discord group, among other backstage enclaves where they meet and agree on what trends or narratives they want to push and what they want to ignore.
---
It's why youtube reviews have become more popular. Their job prospects don't hinge on following whatever political agenda their editor wants to push.
---
Understandable, I doubt anyone really feels like streaming there and it would have just been a depressing stream. :(
---
Dude, Reddit is a tiny minority of the playerbase even if we count non-f2p accounts. To think otherwise is delusional
---
I used to raid in a hardcore raid guild playing with a ps3 game pad and it was fine.
---
Hiiiiint &lt;3
---
I'd like to know too. This was a super annoying "feature."
---
Very valuable post. :-) Thanks. 
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
No, they won't do it.
---
Did the same mistake, made a support ticket, they said it was intended.
---
gotten to  the character select screen but at soon as i load the map i crash
---
&gt; In well supported game people wouldnt even notice that there were some layoffs.
---
how would the quality of a game's support have any effect whatsoever on what gets reported and read on gaming news sites?
---
Isn't WoW pretty well supported? seems like their layoffs were just as noticeable and I don't even play that game.
---
You didn't say anything about wvw content and no, I'm not kidding. Since PoF they have released new maps, new legendaries, new fractals, updates to water combat, sitable chairs, plenty of balance patches, a better system for accessing cosmetic items like chairs, kites and instruments and a new mount just off the top of my head. That's hardly zero content.
---
Yeah now more than ever they need to learn this lesson and get rid of that policy of not talking about future content until it's done. I personally not interested in waiting another year for a new expansion. 
---
They’re both multiplayer and single player and they both have DLC not to mention that PoF was at launch a $30  expansion that required no previous purchase the $30 alone wouldn’t cover the cost to develop PoF
---
[removed]
---
Warframe has a pretty good version of this, actually. lets you fiddle with inventory, do crafting, check limited-time missions, a little bit of passive resource gain, and a news page
---
Both discussion of layoffs and WvW would have been bad
---
yeah, i also feel like the most recent outburst is us finding out that grandma has had cancer for the last 2-3 years. they probably withheld Gw2's misfortune until now, which makes me worried because it means things are really about to hit the fan 
---
It's not ANet that needs to do something with them, but you! Make ascended armour and weapons, and all that material will go to good use.
---
To be fair the topic is about WvW so him talking about WvW would be fairly clear. 
---
That said i don't really agree with him doing it in this situation because at this very point it is very understandable that Arena Net is working with their employes having meetings, answering questions about what will happen with their real life support. 
---
Is this the same Kitty from Raiders in training? Because there is someone in there that does that too ;)
---
I'm sad for ArenaNet because I'm sure many of their developers had a grand vision for their next project. I really wanted to see it.
---
I believe it will take us a few months to get back on track but I’m confident in this new restructuring being best for the fan base.
---
I just realized something. Build templates could have been a “side-project.” Those projects are now cancelled. Build templates were cancelled.
---
I remember that post when it came out. I was really excited for it. I'm now happy for efficiency and discord. I can stay connected with my guild regardless of where I'm at. Still wish I had access to mobile guild chat.
---
Yeah let’s just discount the massive difference in complexity and technology between pre-capitalist entertainment. You’re right, playing with sticks and rocks is exactly the same as a modern MMO driven by extremely powerful, interconnected machines.
---
15,000 hours and you *still* farm the JP? That's rough, man.
---
This, basically it doesn't matter roadmap or not because most of us had zero hype for the expansion years away anyway. Its going to be living world as always then either expansion or content drought. No sub fee so we'll just leave the game again and wait until an expansion ad pops up.
---
Can't login here, "The game client was unable to connect to the log-in server...."
---
Well.. are you surprised with how disgusting the community can be.. They have the maturity of a a 5 year old.
---
Mike Z stated September last year: "but the promise that we have, looking from season four into season 5, we're not afraid to release things traditionally bewing an expansion alongside Living World content."
---
We have to wait and see if this is still valid or is revealed as PR blabla. Season 5 could bring stuff normally reserved for an expansion. Things like new elite specialisations or new mastery paths. The big question is how they can monetise it. Season pass? Mastery path for 1000 gems? Elite specialisation including story instances 600 gems each?
---
I don't have enough mats to feed the converts some days. If you have way too much, you can craft them into bricks and store for a while. 
---
probably doesn't have anything better to do with their life. 
---
same :( 
---
Where did I say “entertainment?” I said “games like GW2.” Of course people found ways to entertain themselves between fighting for survival in the past. Video games in general are a testament to modern innovations and stand atop of all the technological advancements that have been made in capitalist countries.
---
I didn’t think there would be so many proud socialists in here, but it is Reddit so I guess that’s to be expected 
---
Uh arenanet is a "wholly owned subsidiary" of NcSoft.
---
Paragon Studios Says hello. 
---
Don't know about the companies themselves, but the main reason why CoH was closed down was always mentioned to be because it did not do well in Korea, which was NCSoft's main focus.
---
500 employees is a HUGE development team for only having one active game. Many AAA games get made by half that and then run on even less post launch. I have no idea where you got the idea that a 500 man development team is somehow small. 
---
Pixel world or Real wold with real lives at stake. 
---
I rather wait and let them take time to heal, breath, the anxiety of it all, depression and more. Not only for the folks who lose their job. But the folks who now most likely are wondering if their job will be stable enough to keep going or stay. Just please think.. I know you are really wanting WvW stuff or info on it. But think pixel game over real lives who worked on your game and more.  Put yourself in their shoes. 
---
I know some of you like to put fuel on the fire to see how it burns, I know some of you making jokes and memes outta of this. I know some of you have no patience. But this is where patience and some real chill back let people breath. Let them get their next steps and plans together. Yes. I would love to know what later on holds for us. Due to fear of how NCSoft handle CoH. But .. now is not the time. We have to understand its already hell of a day for most these Devs. It's going to be the weekend so any more news may be delayed until most likely Monday. So note for anyone impatience. 
---
Breath!~
---
Chill!~
---
Right now im worried about NCSoft - ANet merging thing.
---
&gt; Until an expansion is announced and in our hands, the truth remains there is no expansion announced.
---
FTFY
---
&gt; P.S. claiming there is an expansion without proof while telling people not to claim there isn't one without proof is hypocritical af
---
There's a difference. I'm not stating that there is an expansion as if it were a fact, instead I'm stating the facts we do have which leads me to believe there is an expansion.
---
most of them didn't care about the new mount tho
---
GW2s competitors (ESO,  FF)  are on the brink of releasing new expansions. Even Neverwinter is getting a massive expansion very soon. While LW episodes are decent they aren't nearly enough to sustain player base. Expansions bring hype,  hype brings players. The development of GW is lagging behind and apparently has been running on a skeleton crew for some time. Theyre going to need to go all out if they want to catch up. As soon as the competitors expansions hit GW2 will lose more population. I wish Anet the best and I really hope they can salvage the situation,  but time is not on their side right now. 
---
I'll come back soon (after I'm done with Division 2) to play through the entire season 4 story, so you're probably right. I would have spent more money on gw2 if it all came at once in an xpack.
---
The heal on hit is really not worth it, dude. [It has an internal cooldown of TEN SECONDS](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Water_Spirit) and is extremely small as it scales with the healing power of the player it affects - not the druid's healing power. 
---
&gt;However, since the other healers don’t need CA, they’re fine.
---
Other healers *have stronger healing so water spirit is redundant as their regeneration will overwrite that of water spirit's*.
---
&gt;The trap is really brought for two reasons, and neither are the regen. The extra water field, and pulsing condi removal.
---
The trap is also brought for the regen, which *is stronger than that of Water Spirit's.*. It's *not* brought for the water field, ever. Combo fields are a tad too unreliable.
---
&gt; It’s like, soothing mist, sure regen is stronger, but that mist is still super strong!!
---
It's *not* super strong as I've already pointed out.
---
&gt;but if your other healer isn’t a Druid, and you don’t need condi cleanse, or spike heal... that spirit is best in slot!!
---
No, it's not. That spirit is extremely redundant compared to Glyph of Rejuvenation or Healing Spring. Doubly so in fractals where Call of the Wild is enough to permanently upkeep regeneration.
---
I'm trying to explain things to you - **I'm a Druid main** (look at my flair!) Water spirit is not as good as you want it to be - it's extremely useful for single-healer scenarios as in most meta comps,  but it falls off with two healers as its main use of applying regeneration to 10 people is largely voided. 
---
Wait, Aion is still a thing and is nearly as much revenue as GW2?!
---
OP isn't bringing up the topic though, he's responding to all the people reacting with hyperbole and bringing up the topic.
---
As opposed to not saying anything... Are you for real? 
---
it was a random comment on the article.
---
I don't ever watch their streams and i still get disappointed! 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
:D
---
ya, but the damage isn't physically linked to the animations. Which is why DoT is always kind of eh in action-based PvP games.
---
When you're playing an action-based game, you should intuitively know what's happening based on what you're seeing with the character models do.
---
for instance, you know you're about to take 10k damage most of the time because it's usually accompanied by an "oh shit, shit's about to happen" animation.
---
With condi, it's like "oohhhh, this thing touched me and now I'm almost dead"
---
Nvm then.
---
You're spamming this sub with pointless posts. They already stated they will continue going regardless of the situation, they also made public through several news sites the things they are cutting off aren't directly related to GW products.
---
Inform yourself and you'll be much more worry free, give it time so they re-organize themselves too.
---
Something tells me a Neverwinter expansion won't have an effect on the GW2 population. There's a reason people play this game over other MMOs.
---
Im not saying they shouldn't say anything at all just pointing out these neckbeards saying "it'd be fine if they just said something" are probably full of bullshit is all. 
---
Im probably more critical than most people when it comes to Anet and how they handle things especially communication, when everything that's currently going on there is said and done then they NEED to communicate with the community and let us know whats going on, they need to tell us plans for the future however at this moment im not going to add more shit into the shitfire because they just got blindsided by these layoff announcements. Its scary for players not hearing anything but its also probably scary for them too and im not going to be hostile at humans just cause they announced the stream was canceled late.
---
&gt;SMH I swear GW2 redditors are on another level
---
Yeah they are on another level cause people on here are one of two extremes, you either fucking defend Anet and they can do no wrong or you Fucking hate them every time they do or don't do something, this fucking community lacks any fucking nuance to anything most of the time. 
---
We don't know whats going on at Anet especially now with this layoff business and that sucks, it really fucking sucks but fuck me for not joining the mob.
---
Did you even spend one second in this sub today before clicking on the "sub new content" button?
---
I still think its a good game. But for me it’s gotten stale. After years of playing there just isn’t anything interesting enough to bring me back. I’m sure the newest episode is fun enough but I’d rather play something else. I’ve logged in a couple of times since early October because it just isn’t fun enough to keep playing after 5+ years.  
---
Honestly though, farming the mats is much worse than just buying it off the tp 
---
No. Until they announce a closure, it's simply not worth expending energy on.
---
Their last statement suggested we're potentially years away from that.
---
it is an account made exclusively for that.
---
It doesn't need saving, financially speaking.
---
Ah famous mirage infusion bug. This thing in infusion form would cost 20k gold easy (with chak egg sac droprates).
---
for having gw2 and creating 2 more projects you can say it's small. for example blizzard to support all those games used to have 4700 employees as a company at least in 2012 (not reffering to activition-blizzard who is the parent company but only for blizzard entertainment). 
---
ofc there was a mismanagement cause pretty much if we believe the rumors left gw2's active teams understaffed to work. note that arenanet had somewhere around 300 devs in 2012. or less don't remember exact numbers and can't seem to find it. 
---
It will be hilarious to see if at some point this
---
"We accept devs" will gone through a whole circle
---
I think you save someting like 5s per soup when crafting it yourself.
---
Apparently, but now other posts are popping up expressing similar dread and woe. Frustrating.
---
Battle Royale, probably.
---
You don't even save that much by crafting that makes the hassle of talking to 5 npcs worth it.
---
I mean, if you're not playing only just because of this news, then you're creating a self fulfilling prophecy. As for the future with game development, not knowing what the future holds is the truth behind any game/content that's not already released/finished releasing stuff. It's a volatile industry that's strangled by unreasonable expectations and demands from corporations/share holders to have something that is Fortnite/Minecraft/OG WoW levels of explosive growth and profit.  It's how you get companies like activision hitting record breaking sales and yet still need to have mass layoffs of around 800 people just because 'it wasn't enough'. 
---
I really hope they had at least some people working on an expansion pack after Season 5, because the way I see it, it could be a very decisive factor for the longevity of the game. 
---
Really, I was convinced - for about a year now - that they were actively working on a new expansion while rolling out LW updates, and that it would be the most polished expansion yet. But with all that's happening right now, it seems that this is not the case.
---
I would just love to know this, whatever the answer is. Please, Anet. Have you been working on an expansion pack? Is there an expansion team at all? 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the same person or a small group of people. Targeted subject, targeted time period, it's nothing new.
---
Yes. I have a whole spreadsheet on various calculations on different scenarios like if I supply my own dust, if I buy the T5 etc. In general it's still a profit and you should have your own spreadsheet to decide whether all the time spent clicking the mystic forge is worth it. 
---
As for me, I do it because I make Legendaries and they require a lot of T6 mats.

Acquisition -&gt; 
---
    Black Lion Chest (historical)  (ie, it was once available, now it's not) 
---
  
---
 Black Lion Exclusives Chest
---
Once upon a time it was available for black lion statuettes. However it's off the rotation now. 
---
TL;DR - it started as an RNG drop from black lion chests, was later made available for statuettes, but is currently unavailable for both. 
---
I'll ask because I don't know the numbers. But I'm assuming GW2 has a larger playerbase.
---
How many players are playing Aion - an asian-style MMO (fashion wars) both developed and published by NCsoft in '09 - compared to GW2? It started as a subscription-based game ($9.99/month I believe) but turned f2p 3 years in.
---
It's still running, most recent major update is a year old, which isn't bad for a game that not many. Aion 2 is even in the works.
---
Why would NCsoft kill off GW (both 1 and 2), if they could easily kill one on their own games that aren't played by nearly as many? A [forum post](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/25141/gw2-population-2018-vs-2016-crosspost-from-reddit) state 3.3 million active GW2 players - give or take.
---
We keep comparing with CoH and subsequenty Wildstar. But they're not the same.
---
Life is about experiences and memories. If you stop playing now, it's as if the game is already shut down. If you keep playing, you can have some more fun and see some beautiful things. 
---
The game will eventually die. You will eventually die. For the past six years there has been a small but existent possibility that you die while GW2 continues on. 
---
Do you understand? Nothing is for granted, so if you enjoy something, enjoy it while it lasts. Shorter is still better than not at all. 
---
That being said, GW2 will likely not suffer from the layoffs in any way we will notice. 
---
Yeah, ive been able to log in on a few chars, all my chars on the mystlock sanctuary are fucked tho
---
Which ps4 are you talking about? 
---
It is possible for it to the save day, it's just highly unlikely once they're on top of it. Too many people wait for the wall to be down then pull it. And yea calling it out is also important.
---
yeah, go ahead and get a job that has worse job security than the one you just lost.
---
Aion is bigger in S. Korea than it ever was here in the west. And GW2 didn't have a LW release in Q4 2018 which is when they get a big boost in gem sales every quarter.
---
I saw what you did there ahahahahahahahaha
---
Daisy still does more then most of my team mates in WvW. 
---
That's one big mass of text trying to somehow prove me wrong even when there's video evidence by people who have researched this shit that show one of the main reasons CoH was closed down was because of NCSoft's focus on korean players.
---
Maurader or Valkyrie are good for survivability. Valk is aight but it has no precision, which longbow kinda needs.
---
Sadly the only thing that happens for the newbies in event periods is getting farmed by more coordinated groups, or tagging along for the free bags if they have the more coordinated group. It's not really indicative of how WvW is most of the time and it's very boring. 
---
They feel like they have low impact in the fights (because they do, not because one player cannot affect the outcome of a fight, but because they don't know how to affect the outcome of a fight), they tag along and hit the downed enemies, or they get one shot in half a second and have to run (or ride) back to the group to get one shot again.
---
I don't see how this can be rectified in any way. I also thought WvW was a shit game mode and like this until I started joining in voice comms, joining guilds, and installed a DPS meter to see the crazy  discrepancy between me and those veterans. Step 1 is realising you're a nobody and Step 2 is working towards being a useful player. It's the same in every PvP game but there's no easy matchmaking or tutorial to get one started for WvW.
---
the recent layoffs was limited to non dev teams. so they can hire more devs
---
Nah. They are firing PC developers to get mobile developers.
---
Who knows? They told us a lot about Utopia, the cancelled 4th GW1 campaign. Only about 10 years after though.
---
Aw I miss GW1's PvP...
---
I wish I could upvote this post more. Thank you.
---
No. Gotta know the animations of the character unfortunately. 
---
Oh boy a forum warrior... "prove me wrong" "video evidence by people who have researched this shit"
---
NCSoft is not focused solely on Korea.
---
It has and has had projects that are focused on Korea such as Lineage, B&amp;S (but even those got western releases). CoH was not a game made for the Korean market, neither was GW and GW2. Not to mention the games i listed above and many others such as Wildstar.
---
You dont shut down something because it is not focused on something it was never designed for.
---
Thank you for sharing this amazing artist! I love all of his gw2 works (and most of the other stuff).
---
Leaked timeline from the future:
---
* Blizzard Entertainment announces record profits and, after deciding they could have done more with less people, discharges 8% of its employees.
---
* ArenaNet advertises career options to dismissed Blizzard employees.
---
* NCSOFT tells ArenaNet to stop making things that aren't *Guild Wars* and prepares to lay off employees.
---
* ArenaNet co-founder Jeff Strain offers jobs at his Seattle game company Undead Labs.
---
* Undead Labs is shuttered by Microsoft to maximize profits because they only made two games in ten years.
---
* Valve Corporation offers their condolences, and says they're hiring because they're also a Seattle/Bellevue game developer.
---
* Valve Corporation stops development on the card game *Artifact* due to lack of playerbase even after going free-to-play, removing half the development team from the company.
---
* Blizzard invites fired Valve developers to apply to teams working on *Hearthstone*.
---
I say it as a good thing cause it's convenient for people: instead of thinking about different hardware choices you buy a console and it's guaranteed to run the games. Also exclusives are another huge selling point. On PC I have all these games yet some of the ones I'd like to play the most are only on consoles, some might come to pc later but it's unsure.
---
As I said, not everyone plays multiplayer. So if you're someone who just plays SP and also doesn't buy tons of games console is gonna be the cheaper option (and it's not like console games never go on sale). Plus most households probably have a TV already so no need to invest in a PC monitor (they aren't cheap).
---
Don't get me wrong, PC is definitely my preferred choice but it isn't always the cheapest option.
---
This feels almost like a loading screen concept art! So nice and peaceful.
---
that sounds a bit crazy high. though surely, some classes seem to gain ranks superfast, or people who only move around in squads. i've played it hours for \~three weeks, and am still not yet lv50. this would leave no players not much chance to get the mount, since in WvW everyone uses their "real" gear, means elite armor/weapons screw new players completely.
---
This is amazing 😍
---
All signs point to gw2 will have a neutral or even positive outcome from the layoffs. Don't freak out lol. 
---
19 more years to complete festival AP!
---
well, all mounts are PoF exclusive yet soo... let's just hope its cheaper than griffon and not requiring a collection like the beetle :P or an extraordinairily high rank in wvw.
---
 Anet basically admitting they were siphoning off staff to work on other projects and really having nothing substantial, other than more copypasta LS stuff, in the works means people are going to drift off.
---
 Many will just take a break but some will poke their heads into other games that seem to be going places to see what's up.
---
 Other MMO's have been adding in more casual content to appeal to the shifting demands of the community. 
---
 People stick with games when they feel their time investment will be carried for a long time. Make them doubt that fact and many will drift off to other games that offer a similar experience while feeling like they will still be in dev mode a year from now.
---
Who?
---
You might as well just give up and not do anything ever then.
---
 The "show don't tell"  is one of my biggest peeves with MMO companies, being left in the dark about what's coming or happening is never a good thing,  and often causes negative stirs in the communtiy (ex: people calling the game dying/dead, unreast due to Dev. silence, etc.) ,   and I hope  Anet cans this moving foward as I feel it hurts more than help; I feel like  this  thread is a pretty  solid breakdown  on the situation, and I hope that those laid off are able to find employment soon 
---
But you weren't. You were referring to rng lootboxes which have not been a thing for a year.
---
You keep editing your original comment. That's  scummy and undermines our points completely.. You've done it at least twice now.
---
Congratulation, you gamed the system.
---
the lag that mounts in pve at farmspots and blobs in wvw bring, fused together? i sense a laghell incoming... i hope they thought of this.
---
What chest, gloves, and boots are you using? 
---
After all the time spent on Pro Leagues and creating ranked they've only added a major sigil rehaul (which was sorely needed in spvp because before there were only three viable sigils that were just passive trash) and automated tournaments, which includes 2v2 at times. There also all of the balance changes that currently gives us 6 out of 9 classes with meta builds.
---
I'd imagine the chat would have been really hard to moderate after the ensuing shit show that the WvW community performed.
---
Thats actually not completely true Lotv has more games per day than WoL and Hots had at it’s highest point 296k where as Lotv had at its highest 262k at the end of Hots games/day were relatively low lotv has a somewhat stable curve and even an increase after the F2P announcement with the current wcs and gsl matches it also had quite good viewer numbers on twitch. Source: https://www.rankedftw.com/stats/population/1v1/#v=1&amp;r=-2&amp;sy=g&amp;sx=a  . So I doubt it’s going anywhere soon it’s afterall still the most competitive 1v1 game.  
---
Not getting mad at Tangled Depths the second time around... 
---
&gt; apparently has been running on a skeleton crew for some time
---
Sauce?
---
Difficult to pin one down really. 
---
Probably either crafting Eternity, or unlocking the griffon. (I know pretty much everyone has a griffon these days, but it's just so damn fun to fly around on)
---
There's just so much factually wrong with your comment. 
---
Legendary armor was always supposed to  a reward for raids. And it didn't take a year for them to reveal it.
---
WvW restructure: still hasn't happened but why would this mount mean it's not happening?
---
Mount lootboxes; a non-issue for a year. It was an issue for a month tops.
---
It is quite speculative, but he makes that known. It's a lot better than other people who speak so confidently like what they think is fact, when it too, is speculative
---
I can't even bear my alt acct now just because it has no griffon
---
People need to chill out with this.  No one on GW1 or GW2 team is being laid off. It is OTHER Anet people who are being laid off.
---
GWAMM
---
Did you really expect it? It would have been a shit show.
---
&gt;Based on the speculative evidence we have, it seems that what's going on here is that NCSoft wants to cut ArenaNet's development on unanounced projects - for reasons we don't know - assumedly to focus solely on Guild Wars 2. 
---
The last quarterly report had NCSoft's revenues flat quarter over quarter.  Mobile gaming hasn't been growing, and the MMO segment is being driven by games several years old or more.  Throw in all the losses from Wildstar and Master x Master, and its easy to imagine the shareholders are getting restless.  
---
My biggest fear isn't Arenanet closing shop.  My biggest fear is Arenanet being *sold*.
---
Ya in Asia maybe, not in the west, unless Anet was planning some shitty candy crush puzzle game that has nothing to do with the Guild Wars IP.
---
Mobile gaming in the west hasn't been "big money" for years now. Hell, the only mobile games I even hear people talking about are Anime waifu games like Fate GO and Girls Frontline. 
---
Those aren't the kinds of games Anet is going to make and Diablo Mobile has shown us how much western audiences give a shit about mobile "gaming"
---
ya but that could change *shrug*
---
IMO and MMO cannot survive without expansions.
---
GW2 is going on 7 years old.  By the time living story season 5 completes it will be 8 years old (assuming 6 episodes 3 months apart).
---
My guess/hope is that living story season 5 is the lead in for GW3.
---
PvEers will outnumber you my sweet child and finding press-x-jason cancer build doesn't that much

---
Guildnite 
---
Wouldn't surprise me if season 5 is pay for but each episode comes with more expansion type content like 1-2 elites released per ep.
---
My first Keep Construct kill was with the Challenge Mote active
---
&gt;Personally I'd be happy with a bit of both - more staggered Living World releases with some existing content in between - but a lot of people here already see the current Living World schedule as "unacceptable".  IMO, asking for bigger, longer, and more frequent (free) Living world updates while also asking for large (free) overhauls to existing content is a bit more than wanting your cake and eating it too.
---
One technique to do both would be to tie new story content to old maps. You have to be slightly careful with sequencing (i.e. a new player shouldn't fight an enemy that hasn't been born yet while playing through POF the first time), but it would give them an excuse to retool POF metas while also delivering single player story content.
---
Except that's in Asia. Have you ever played an Asian mobage? They're trash. Literally interfaces to exploit gambling addiction in people who have nothing else in their lives to spend money on.
---
They aren't going to force their only Western development studio to make a game for the Korean/Chinese/Japanese market. If they wanted that, they would just fold Anet entirely and divert funds to a new studio in Korea.
---
No one in the West is going to spend $1000 on gacha rolls for some crappy mobile RPG. Look at how well Diablo Mobile went over if you think I'm wrong.
---
I said GW3 is a dumb idea because it is on the face of it. No matter what platform it's on. It's silly to see people asking for it.
---
Here's the roadmap.
---
   Now
---
|
---
Season 5.
---
They probably don't even know what's going to happen after.
---
Lol 3 hours delaying fans but they are up and censoring their forums in minutes.  Censorship, the one thing anet is good at delivering.
---
They probably get more views from this than writing a review for a GW2 expansion.
---
Sad.
---
That was one of the problems due to player outcry. Players managed to get to max level faster than Anet expected (although with their level curve, I'm not sure why they expected players to take so long to hit 80). From there, the endgame content wasn't polished and where Colin/etc wanted it. Dungeons didn't give end rewards (bosses only had their respective chests with 3 tokens per boss, incentivizing easy bosses for tokens). Champions had a slightly higher chance at rare loot compared to other mobs, but nothing outstanding or unique in their drop tables. World Bosses were meant to be done with varying levels of coordination, but had similar loot to dungeon boss chests (see: fairly shit) with a chance at unique loot (not all of which was in their respective drop tables, woo).
---
The list goes on further, but the main point is that once you hit 80, there was "not a lot to do". ANet was trying to fix things left and right, with varying levels of success. If something didn't work, try something else (instead of improving it so it works) was their motto. They decided to do one-off events to keep players interested, with a slight tie-in to story. Fractals were released alongside Southsun Cove and their first part of the Living World.
---
The intended point was that the world evolves alongside you. You have to actively play to be a part of the worlds evolution, similar to reality (you can't just "live" in whatever timezone you want, for the most part). After the first episode and subsequent releases, they were met with more success than expected. People enjoyed the evolution of the world and the content provided. However, the issue was that the content, alongside the previous releases (Queen's Gauntlet, Zephyrite's, etc) were all temporary. Players wanted to be able to relive it or just enjoy it, as well as rare drops being tied to limited content not being fun for collectors.
---
So they learned from their mistakes and tried something new. Living Story started to affect the world permanently (RIP Kessex), and then they realized that temporary permanent is still temporary, so they worked on each episode adding a new zone instead of building upon the lore inside the world (each zone has tons of mini-stories that can be expanded on, RIP Wizard Tower).
---
So that's how we ended up with each episode adding a new zone and LW making us jump across the world with little reasoning (also Inquest and (Caudecus) Bandits ^tm are everywhere apparently).
---
This is probably a cope post like the rest but is still the best possible scenario.
---
Given [current year] Anet's track record for game development, it's not hard to imagine that these new projects quickly became directionless hot messes that were hemorrhaging money with no clear launch date in site.
---
I'm with you. I will cutdown my daily play time for sure. Only login for rewards and flipping. And of course I will play whenever new content launches.      
---
     
---
IMO people are way too trusting and buy into PR because it supports their biases. I'm not saying ANET will close down but I'm open to whatever. Ask yourself what sane company will admit there is a chance we may go out of business so don't buy our products for a while. The soviet union didn't annouce they were collapsing and business went on as usual... until it was too late.   
---
   
---
Keep in mind "proof is in the pooding".  
---
 
---
&gt; Then the focus on hardcore only raids further alienated the players they were able to take from WoW.
---
The what now?
---
It's great that you aren't swayed by the hyperbolic masses, but there were (and to a lesser extent still are) a lot of people proclaiming the game is dying specifically due to the layoff news. Not to say that people didn't proclaim the game was dying before but then it was fully unfounded and they couldn't actually point to any one thing for a reason.
---
The OP was in reaction to those people who were seeing the layoff news and thinking GW2 was in a bad spot. The OP was making this post for those people, not those like yourself or myself, who knows or doesn't believe GW2 is in a bad spot.
---
I disagree with the whole "leave it be, let people talk, let people complain" because if there's only ever people complaining and talking about the end times, then that affects people who are coming in looking for how the game is doing. They wouldn't know that the comments about the game dying are pure hyperbole. And then there are those who just heard about the situation and see first just the hyperbole, and take that as their first impression.
---
This thread was for those people. Not you or me.
---
But still, in the end, your post and the OP's were stating the same thing. That there isn't an issue and that you should just play the game and enjoy it, not worry about it. Even if you think you're saying something different, it's really just from a different point of origin.
---
Happy little accident.
---
I've missed out on buying this recipe for months now. Finally, tonight the stars aligned! I logged in, and went straight to the merchant. However, to my astonishment, I had already learned the recipe at some point. So now I've learned my lesson. Always check to see if you have something unlocked before waiting around for months on end.
---
Literally nobody who cares about making money cares about WvW dude.

Im quite proud to own the Temporal Tourist title, which as of right now, is [rarer than most legendaries.](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.key=titles)
---
It can but it needs a consistent stream of content injected into it on a regular basis.
---
2 hours of "meh" story and some mindless grind every 3-4 months isn't that.
---
Anet would need to put out AT LEAST one new fractal/dungeon every other month. That new content needs it's own rewards, not just trash loot for the TP. Exclusive skins and things like chairs.
---
They would also need to gradually trickle in new expansions to the game mechanics as well.
---
Add in new weapons per class or new trait lines every 6 months. They don't need to be whole new elite specs, but they would need to be major additions to the classes to give us something new to play with.
---
New introductions of game systems also every 4-6 months. Doesn't have to be major shit like mounts but even just putting in new, smaller guild halls with lower costs would be good content.
---
The living story map spam is a tired, worn out failed strategy and won't keep them afloat but they could avoid big pve area expac's if they still give us the stuff people actually buy the packs for.
---
Having everything in the wardrobe unlocks done + all the legendary weapon skins &amp; 39k ap
---
It's a huge deal when you're dealing with customers. No other industry would find this acceptable, and no other consumers would be so eager to apologize for it.

I'd just like to say it's really sad for everybody who got laid off and I hope they all end up alright.

Holy shit, that's amazing. Not only is it an exceptional piece of art, it's drawn in the style of Guild Wars 2. Even without the characteristic armour and mount, it screams Guild Wars 2.
---
I wanted to add a few things here:
---
1) There seems to be a lot of animosity in this reddit towards  A/Net for working on other products. Well, for diverting resources from GW2 to these other products. A/Net would have been negligent if they hadn't. GW2 is not going to go on for ever. As much as I would like GW2 to last forever, it never will. A company has an obligation to it's staff, customers and shareholders to always look out for the future. To try and invest in ways that will ensure the long term sustainability. The best way for A/Net to be in a position to continue to invest in GW2 is for them to explore other games. For now, GW2 will be funding those games. In the future, it could be the other way around. It looks like things didn't pan out this time but I hope they continue to explore things like this.
---
2) I really don't understand the doomsayers climbing into PoF and saying how wonderful HoT was. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy both. But from a financial point of view, PoF has been much more successful. If I include the month before HoT (presales), over a 6 quarter period, HoT made $110 million and PoF made $133 million. HoT had a big drop off after release where the drop off in PoF was much more gradual. In other words, more money was being spent post release which would point to more customers.
---
3) Expansions make money. HoT brought in $55 million over a half year period and PoF brought in $53 over the same time. Compared to their normal quarterly sales amounts there is every reason to believe that they will have one in the works. They can't just release an expansion with more story. People will freak out. They will have to add game features. Maybe something like player housing.
---
I feel terrible for the people that lost their jobs but this isn't even remotely close to the end of GW2 or something like maintenance mode. You don't stop working on a product that is bringing in an average of roughly $90 million per year.
---
How about you give them time to talk to the people who are wondering if they have a job or not first? They found out from the same source we did that layoffs would be happening. They still didn't know if they had jobs when they went to work this morning. They know to tell in advance if something is cancelled, it's perfectly reasonable that it slipped through the cracks given what's going on.
---
Forget for a moment that this is a game you play and imagine it's real people with families, jobs, lives and they are all wondering which of them won't have a job next week.
---
It's possible some of the people who run their twitter or twitch streams are among those who no-longer have a job. They know it's better to tell people ahead of time if something is cancelled. They didn't make a conscious decision to not tell you, they probably didn't remember the stream because they are busy with the obvious. This isn't a normal time for the company.
---
Because unlike business meetings and such we can approach this game and the events surrounding it with a sense of empathy for the people who make it, or at least I would hope so.
---
Yeah it shows a lack of professionalism.
---
One assumes it means unrelated unannounced releases. The next expansion has not been announced. PoF had a team of 70 employees. A layoff of 80 may very well have killed the next expansion.
---
This and Ranger's Swoop "infusions" are my favorite. The only problem is the sound, though.
---
GW and balance, quite a subtle joke.
---
Beating Liadri before the relaunch of the Queen's Gauntlet and getting the Season 2 Shadow of the Dragon achievements. Took a bunch of tries and experimentation with builds before I beat it. Felt like a puzzle where the traits are the pieces. 
---
I'm used to be really big into GW2 and am recently getting back into it. I would periodically log in and buy things from the gem store that I'd want to use once I get back into it.
---
Absolutely stunning, the detailing on the hilt of the GS is insane
---
That's amazing!!
---
Well gw2 is on downfall, I allready start to look something more refreshing. It's not just about the game, there are many factors for me to keep engaging with the content (game). Current situation is just dark, I don't like political stuff, it is either black or white. I hope they get things together. 
---
Given that the devs found out about this through a parent company email, seemingly with no warning from their own leadership, this is not a time of certainty about anything. Why would someone purposefully sit on their hands for 3 hours after the stream was scheduled to start to inform twitch (and twitter) that the stream was cancelled? Might be that they hoped the stream would just be delayed. Might be they were told to wait for a higher-up to decide. We don't know and we probably won't, but the buck stops with Anet leadership, not the devs.
---
Leadership are the ones making the broad reaching decisions, but they haven't told  anyone actively interacting with the community to keep us in the loop. If they've made any decision about what information to share with us, we're seeing it now by the absence of any communication, beyond linking everyone to the official statement.
---
Instead of pressuring the devs, hold the leadership accountable for this mess.
---
The time siphoned, the money siphoned. Im upset. 
---
Thank you for this writeup. I am sure like me, many others will appreciate all these facts and the discussions and comments such a thread brings about. 
---
It's unlikely the employee behind the keyboard had any say in the decision, or the delay. Hold the leadership accountable.
---
I feel you missed a Half Life 3 joke in there...
---
Any game can shut down at any time really and we never really own anything from games beyond our experiences and memories. There's no sub to GW2 so as long as you're still enjoying yourself, why not just play, regardless of whether it shuts down tomorrow or 5 years from now? After all, that's all any game is supposed to do, isn't it? Bring enjoyment?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;The amount of resources spent on single player one-time experiences is staggering. It's time ArenaNet wakes up and starts treating GW2 like the multiplayer game it is.
---
You mean like LW Season 1?
---
&gt; if people knew Cantha was on the way.
---
What is this incredible *obsession* people have with Cantha on this subreddit? We're not going to Cantha. The Chinese government would pitch an absolute temper tantrum over it and levy fines against ArenaNet.
---
Could there be a possible chance that had Arenanet shown off what they had in mind and enough of the fanbase supported the idea, it would have come to fruition?
---
Incorrect. Sylvari in fact are one of the few beings that *can* hear the agony of trees. Also Santa Claus is a norn and the tooth fairy a surly Asura. Also, we killed a god or two while the rest peaced out.  
---
Welcome to Tyria!
---
I see you’re still on step one - denial.
---
I kind of with that there was some kind of global percentage listing. It would be fun to know whether the achievements I've got are ones everyone's got or if I've got some super rare one that only .5% of the playerbase has.
---
That said, I run around with the The Blazing Light title on my main. 
---
So the trick is that dead players don't have underwater skills. The optimal strategy on release was to loot as many rations as possible while working your way down to the bottom-right island. From there, camp/chill out until you need to use a ration/people start dying and find your location. Eat a ration (try to time it as late as possible, but be wary of ghosts around you). Then start swimming directly west. Whenever you need to heal, quickly pop out of the water and eat a Ration, then continue until you hit the leftmost island. The remaining players will slowly get picked off by lack of rations, ghosts plotting revenge, and the "natural" karka spawns.
---
Since you're swimming, the ghosts won't be able to cast spells on you (no underwater skills). Since you're swimming, the ghosts will be constantly chasing you (can't cast Karka ahead of/on you if they're behind you).
---
The other players can attempt to find you to kill you, but you've stocked rations and most people won't survive more than 3 full health bars (3 rations). Meanwhile, you'll ideally have 8+ and are only taking tick damage.
---
They added Sharks to prevent this strategy, but it's still doable, you just run along the coasts instead. If a Champion is spawned, just swim a little deeper to avoid it.
---
Works fine for me?
---
Works for me too
---
You've won.
---
Step one - denial. You’ll get there friend
---
Getting to max mastery rank. Those HoT mastery points were a pain to get, I never thought I'd do it but I got there in the end. 
---
Lately, the Temporal Tourist title. Just hacked away at it when I had some spare time and got it last week. So much Mistonium! 
---
It's not Expansions that drive Hype -- It's the marketing team. This is what ArenaNET needs to put money into more than anything else right now. The more people that are hyped to play, the more money that will come in to drive new content.
---
Consider the amount it costs for a world transfer. There are guilds full of people making wholesale jumps to high pop servers on a regular basis, currently. WvW is probably bringing in more money than it has in a long time.
---
I love it so much I'm getting a second piece done! 10/10 would recommend

Delete the cookies, i had also this issue some time ago

Hahaha no

I don't really like sharing other artist's pricing structure/business model but I found the prices very reasonable.
---
Nothing in the lore that states your average tree is anything but a tree.
---
Now if its an elemental, empowered by magic or a dragon minion that's different.
---
But most trees are just trees
---
Seriously, this. You don't even have to do garbage dailies like do 3 events in Brisban Wildlands or similar. Do the easy ones like vista viewing and gathering, and if you still need 1 or 2 check your WvW dailies. Veteran Slayer, Camp Capturer, Yak Slapper, and Monuments are all extremely fast and easy and the odds of encountering enemy players while doing them isn't very high as long as you stay away from EB.
---
Ok then give me your stuff.
---
I think this would have economic consequences that you aren't considering.
---
Creating liquid cash from nothing and distributing it into an economy en masse like this is called inflation, and it's generally very bad when allowed to run rampant.
---
Just like real-world economies, adding tons of cash to a system with limited resources to purchase, results in the prices of those resources increasing to compensate for the additional liquid cash that everyone has available to spend. As more cash continues to flood in, the prices continue to rise.
---
On any given week, 100g can buy X amount of resources. In an inflationary economy like you suggest implementing, the next week that same X amount of resources has now increased in prices - let's say by 10% - to 110g. The next week it's increased again to 121g, the week after that it's 133g. It's fine, you think, because you have your extra daily gold to purchase stuff. But now you look at your wallet of gold, and realize that holding onto cash is insane because the purchasing power is steadily going down, so the longer you hold onto your gold, the less it's worth.
---
So now you're faced with either a constantly decreasing stash of liquid gold wealth, or using your gold to purchase another resource that will hopefully hold its value better. So you invest in mystic coins to stop your rapid wealth loss due to gold inflation. But now you have a big headache: how do you interact with the economy without any gold? You have to barter with everyone in whispers for mystic coin transactions now. How do you know the value of anything anymore without a stable trading post to interact with? How many mystic coins will four stacks of mithril to finish your legendary cost? Who will be willing to trade mithril for mystic coins? How do you ensure you don't get cheated without relying on the TP? Is it worth converting mystic coins back into gold everytime you want to do a transaction, losing 15% to TP fees?
---
Inflation is a pain in the butt. You don't want this.
---
How much does the artist request for this piece?
---
Love this, thanks for sharing another amazing artist :)
---
That's the Whispers Secret Chest, Protectors Gauntlets and Rampart Warboots.

I'll pass it on to him, glad you like it!
---
He's really talented. No regrets at all with the piece it's a great piece of art.
---
I was really surprised how well he did the sword. We weren't even going to use Eternity in the first place but it ended up being a great decision!
---
and if i had 10 alt accounts? 100g a day! pretty sure ppl will crash the economy
---
Praise anet tirzah!
---
It works perfectly fine for me and most people it seems. It's probably something on your end that's blocking it. Maybe a browser extension, or try deleting your cookies.
---
Praise bill!
---
Second this. To elaborate a little, in P/P just spam Unload (#3). In S/P keep Black Powder on the ground, stand in it, autoattack, and mobs that melee attack you while standing in Black Powder will be perma-Blinded and can’t hit you.
---
Omg yeah i remember that lupi solo it was around the same time i started soloing him 
---
Getting the unclean and the archdiviner titles one after the other in the same day
---
Those layoffs are just a clever way to get people to forget about the WvW mount drama
---
Probably getting world first dhuum cm after over a week of trying every day for multiple hours, the fact that it didnt get beaten by others for a few weeks made it even better
---
10 gold is too much, maybe 5g is a good median.
---
The day I got my crafting high enough to refine them down was a good one... I think I cleared about 12 stacks from my inventory. 
---
Even better, anet should just give out free gold by mail every day right lol?
---
Why you got to ruin the illusion of life for me!
---
&gt; suggest you should either contact support to link your accounts, or create a new account and link that to Guild Wars 1. You may have tried the Guild Wars 2 free trial many years ago and that could have caused issues.
---
I had an experience like. Thanks for being the one person who provided a useful suggestion :D
---
Totally can understand why they cancelled the stream. However, it is still somehow not professional to let people wait for 3 hours. You made an appointment but now you want to delay or postpone it to other days due to some urgent issues? No problem, but let your clients know in advance, or at least several minutes late, not 3 hours late. I hope Anet will not repeat this again.
---
I really want to play reaper in raids. Spamming 2 while below 50% health sounds so much fun! How hard is it to manage the shroud? Do you get enough life force?
---
I am talking about the i don't play games for fun and interactive gameplay but to feed my addiction of getting arbitrary rewards so unless i constantly get "loot" i don't like the game type of people, when most games are played for the gameplay itself, look at MOBA's, BR games, both of which are very popular right now.
---
I don't get people that can't grasp the concept of playing a game for fun, when they say there is nothing to to in Gw2 at max level yet the game has all content other MMO's offer.
---
And there is me still thinking that 2g was a little high when they introduced it. Half would be sufficient.
---
All of the S1 achievements and titles
---
Taking a few days to right the ship (and actually figure out the layoffs - people are still finding out if they have a job or not) is completely reasonable and doesn't discount the statement they made. It doesn't mean GW2 is going to tank, but this next couple of weeks are going to be extraordinarily difficult for ArenaNet and while I believe them when they say GW2 will remain unaffected, I don't think it's dishonest to say that and have some issues during the layoffs. A worker is still going to be able to work and perform their job after their parent dies, but it's reasonable for them to under-perform for a few days after the death.
---
but how did it go financially, given it was an xbox game?
---
Wooooow. Straight to the nazi germany references. Let's see if the mods agree with you.
---
You know employees still don't know if they have jobs or not right? A mountain was dropped on ArenaNet two days ago, their first priority is to figure out who is staying and who is going (and let them know), that could easily have distracted people from doing their jobs to full effectiveness.
---
It's called a piano rotation because you need to manage at least 4 different skillbars (including conjured weapons), while having skills that add additional effects onto each attunement (primordial stance and weave self), and each attunement is split into halves and give a combo skill with the other attunements.
---
The benefit of art is that you can make these armor pieces not clip and also have the actual same color where you’ve given them the same color in game.
---
My God Walking Among Mortals title. I was so happy when they allowed me to carry the title over. Although it's related to gw1 mainly I think it's still quite the hefty achievement.
---
Basic economics.   The minimum wage goes up, so does everything else...
---
Yeah customers are first, but honestly this probably did fall through the cracks I used to be a district manager for one of the largest companies in amarica , it's not just them emotionally imploding as you said, this livestream is the last thing on the list of importance. There are people who have been developing content for you all, people who get fired before bugs or everything is working on it could push back the release by months or could even get it scrapped. They have to cram and get everything smooth before they leave there jobs. For you all on top of being emotionally fragile and normally this stuff comes from so far up it hits even some of management throwing off plans and time schedules and are still expected to finish everything so it dosent just suck for the ones laid off but everyone. So sorry for your inconvenience, because there were bigger things going on at the company and some people forgot or didnt get the message.
---
Not to mention the pvp rooms dedicated to getting the easy pvp dailys. There's even one with a bot to kill that's literally always available so if you're stuck doing them on off hours he's there for you.... to kill. Repeatedly.
---
For real! ATLEAST behave like a company that wants to live &gt;.&lt;
---
What do you mean by marketing? What can they market if they dont have new content to show or to get us hyped about.
---
&gt; That doesn’t make complete sense. Hardcore raids wouldn’t alienate WoW players, if anything it would contribute to keeping them.
---
People left WoW to play Gw2 with the promise that it wouldn't have raids catered to hardcore players. Now they are trying to woo them with hardcore raids of their own. But most hardcore raiders are going to stick with WoW.
---
&gt; No, everyone knows that, but are questioning it. WoW has been steadily losing players since ~2011, and especially in the most recent BfA expansion. Also GW2’s revenue model depends less on size of the player base, and more on its ability to milk a smaller number of whales who spend a lot on the game.
---
Same could be said of WoW. They already have lots of microtransactions on top of subs. WoW can lose millions of players and still be much bigger than GW2.
---
To anyone who has ever had a part in creating GW2 -
---
Thank you, so very much. Your creativity, details, world building, business model, mechanics, and so much more makes your endeavor absolutely shine. Looking at the game in its current state, and the years since release, there is so very much to appreciate. The imagination put into it cannot be understated. I have put many (by my standards) hours into the game and will absolutely support you going forward.
---
I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you are always creative.

Because the perfect time to drop in productivity is when reductions are announced.

I, for one am happy that NCSoft is back in business. Not because I particularly like big, greedy companies (or NCSoft in this case) but because I can see how well GW1's (which was under NCSoft management)  content and advertising was handled and how poorly GW2's.

Yeah, really, fuck off you pieces of shit, I don't care if they ban me for this comment, but I'm fucking tired of spoiled crybabies that having tantrums because they have to wait a little to watch a livestream or to play a game. 
---
There are things more important that your fucking asses, a lot of people has been laid off. The remaining people in Anet need time to talk, organize, and  recomfort.

Litteraly this drives me crazy. Living world is killing the game. Other mmos have expansions. Their players are looking forward to new massive maps to explore, new classes, skills, mechanics, new content and so on. What we look forward to is 2 hours worth of a shitty story no one cares about and a small map that'll keep you busy for a few days at best. And the worst part is that we don't know if an xpac is even coming. It's not like "yeah, it's two seasons of lw but we are also working on a big xpac and since it's going to be our best project so far, we need time". That could keep players on the game but right now we aren't even sure there will be anything after this boring ass lw. Also, aren't xpacs their best source of income? Why delaying them so much for the sake of lw? Mmorpgs are the last thing people look at if they want to enjoy a story. Haven't played in months, don't plan to until an xpac is announced and if it's not, the game is dead for me. I'm sure a lot of people feel the same.

now if you dont have the serial key im really sorry but you are screwed...
---
Nah, not gonna fuck off. Where do you work at?
---
Come on, then. Or are you acting like a punk because you've never had a job in your life and you still live on mommy and daddy's paychecks?
---
No. Just no. Stop this.
---
It's pretty, but I'm kinda lost. Where's the face?
---
Expansions should have been the focus as well as new SPvP mode that's larger scale but not WvW numbers. 
---
For sake of discussion care to elaborate on this?
---
How about when you get 20% of the players interested in your mode as the PRIMARY reason they play, then you get 20% of the focus???
---
As we both know that the people who play GW2 for the PvP and WvW make up a sliver of a fraction of the actual community and you’re just being utterly blinkered.
---
Also your singular advice on how to “save the game”, that may or may not need saved; is invest in PvP... which is just a stupid opinion, as theirs literally tons of proof that shows people in MMO’s, in the main are primarily interested in PvE.
---
GW2 devs can track where people play and where their focus is; you know why pvp and WvW has seen virtually no dev time in literal years.... because it wasn’t worth it. It’s barely worth balancing, never mind adding a fuck ton of new content for it.
---
The most active place I saw the old WvW maps was the bloody jump puzzle and that was filled with PvE players trying to get the achievement and nob head pvp players occasionally trolling them. 
---
Most of event compilation I always make good money from gathering as I hop from one event to another, it’s kinda less on starting area maps, but most of the time it’s great time for me ^^ 
---
the most dangerous trust fall
---
AureneNet
---
Entering top 200 in pvp. Is stayed like a week b4 getting kicked but wow so cool
---
3 mins?!
---
Completing dailies takes at least 10 mins up to 40 mins depending on dailies. Most of the time goes to waiting for the veteran NPC spawning for WvW Veteran Creature Slayer, waiting for someone to tag up for Bounty Hunter (might take up to an hour!) and anything WvW related (expect Big Spender) when there is many gankers around (dead -&gt; respawn -&gt; dead again etc.), or there is no tag for Daily Tower/Keep Capturer, or someone captures something in a nanosecond before managing to reach it, or there is simply nothing to capture. Daily Invasion Defender is the most difficult daily.
---
Sometimes Vista Viewer takes time because of the jumping puzzle before it and sometimes Daily Gatherer takes time because I can't find any nodes.
---
Unfortunately I can't give an answer to that, due to extremely strict NDA's, and answering might point to information that could make me look as breaking the NDA. I've worked on some AAA titles, all I can say now (and due to my line of work it pretty much irks me when the community makes impossible requests and bashes ArenaNet for not going for them, but that's another topic) :)
---
State of Decay 2 got somewhat poor reviews, though:
---
[https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/state-of-decay-2](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/state-of-decay-2)
---
The game was very criticized for being filled with bugs and not really adding much when compared to the first one. I hope Undead Labs is doing fine.
---
Undead offering help? Zhaitan!
---
Orange man bad mantra within the company ruined the game
---
is that a serious post?
---
They are in the same company...
---
Well probably they are going to cut off a lot of the employees that do this kind of things and keep only those who work on the game itself.
---
We will get a lot less explanations from now on and things would just be released
---
Are you out of your mind? 10g is insane for dailies which are incredibly easy. Dailies used to give nothing other than 10AP, the 2 gold was added at some point after HoT.
---
Y'all acting like it's our joh to keep this game alive, don't get me wrong, I spent  2k bucks on this game because I enjoy it, but if they turn this game bland and lame, I'll just find another game and play it. 
---
I'm not worry about this game dying, I love this game and I supported, if they won't do their job, then we'll just find something else to play.
---
If i remember correctly AA have higher dps than Pistol whip. With the whole Black Powder spamming you'll want to save your innitiative. =D
---
&gt; The game was in big trouble before this was announced yesterday.
---
Indicated where?
---
Not to mention WvW Big Spender. Just hop into a guild hall or WvW and buy a Badge of Tribute or some siege and you're done.
---
It's open world mobs man, just pistol whip them a couple of times and delete them so yu can move on.
---
Point here is to level, not draw things out by using Black Powder and autos. 
---
This is very well written, and very informative. Thank you for how much time you put into researching and writing this. I feel a lot better knowing that my favorite game isn't going to implode. :P
---
Beating Liadri was definitely my first thought as well. Probably the first time I felt I really had a handle on my main.
---
The game is fine, i don't get people that say there isn't enough content lol.
---
Only MMO i can stand rn.
---
I appreciate if you as a "mound hunter" use pink tag to not distract from the wvw gameplay your server is intrested in. 
---
But I sugest everyone to put some effort in playing the gamemode.
---
I am sure every wvw community has some "how to basic" guide or better, we realy like players that folow these guides. If you folow them you would probably do better than half of your server, even if these guides are sometimes outdated. The problem most players have with your avrage pve players that enters the mist is: they are badly equiped (even for pve but ecpecialy for wvw) and they do not use half there skills (thats my expirence from open world meta events sometimes even raids). 
---
Even a good amount of the wvw players have questionable builds or play poorly. 
---
If you are willing to put in effort to play "good" we gladly help, but playing with ppl that die on the first sight of an enemy is not fun at all for neither you or me.
---
As "new blood" in wvw you should look for a wvw build (try to avoid team chat there are many trolls out there) and play with your team, if you like the gamemode consider joining a wvw guild (everything is more fun with friends).
---
No clue how you can read this 
---
&gt;For those of us working on GW2, our mandate was essentially to make it look like there was the same level of resources devoted to GW2, when they were actually steadily moving people off of it onto the other projects.
---
And think anything other than the game is on its way out and the company is ready to put it on maintenance mode.
---
100% world completion on my character. I'm an alt fanatic and I start new characters, level up and then delete them far too much, so I only ever got to around 31% map completion (I have had around 30 level 80s since beta and I don't play much, so all my time was put into them). More recently I chose a character and managed to stick to it! Hopefully I can enjoy some more level 80 content now I'm happier with specific characters! Next stop is fractals, whatever they are!
---
how do you do the reaper one?
---
this will destroy the game
---
In your rush to accuse people of being empathy voids, did you consider that the criticisms about being unprofessional might be levelled at those who dropped these changes on staff without making contingencies for the inevitable outcomes?
---
You don't just decide to cut staff. The writing's on the wall looooong before you gather everyone into the board room to read out who's in and who's out. Weeks (or months) of discussions go into the process. The average grunt on the ground doesn't know, but are you honestly saying that between announcing the cuts, and letting staff know, senior management didn't plan out what would happen?
---
Senior management are supposed to know exactly what work's in the pipeline, what the effects will be and what needs to happen to ensure customers aren't pissed off. And if the dept head responsible for community engagement, didn't account for: "stream not going ahead today" and ensure there was something on Twitch announcing it to customers (just put up a screenshot saying it's not happening), then that's unprofessional.
---
i assume it's because of nostalgia from gw1(especially since we got crystal desert already) and genuine preference of the oriental aesthetics
---
the downvotes are because you are a espousing insane conspiracy theories: china, while quite authoritarian by western standards is NOT a communist state! 
---
they aren't throwing much of a temper tantrum over the numerous exposes about the way they handle the tibet situation or the uyghur population..but a videogame?? that's where they draw the line!
---
there is a huge overlap between games popular in china and those popular in japan and korea and they certainly don't all depict "communist chinese cultures"
---
tl;dr you're a nutjob
---
Proplematic could be the impact this might have on the monetization model of the game. This confirms more or less what a lot of people where allready thinking. What are 400 people doing there? How is it even to much work to implement a set of armor over an outfit in the gemstore? In a scenario where its up to you wether you want to spend money on the game or not, the faith in supporting the game plays an important role. It may discourage folks to know their cash went to some mobile game.
---
Ouch :'(
---
Slow? Compared to what, i don't know any other game that lets me cast as many instant casts at the same time as i want.
---
Now is the time that management or someone needs to step in and show that everything is fine.  
---
I've been making a guild for my server that does all game modes of GW2, I've spent time and RL money to help bring in a community of people and when you cancel a stream that would help bring people into the game, it's just makes me feel they don't care about the product or their fanbase that's trying to help bring people into the game.  
---
Think about all the content creators that could've used that stream to go "Look, they're moving on from it, buisness as usual!" or even how other devs might feel, it's so bleak.  
---
Yeah, people will say how much the game is dead in the stream but all this has done is given them more ammo.  
---
I don't care about the stream, wouldn't watch it anyway. You just need to realize that in a corporate  enviroment, when there are lay offs planned, you gotta work twice as hard and stand out. As far as I know, the lay offs haven't started even yet.
---
If you'd "need time to talk, organize, and recomfort" during such time,  you would the the first one to go. Learn the lesson the easy way before you learn it the hard way.
---
As I said to /u/Daybroker, saying: "it's not professional what you did" is criticism against management for not, well, managing the situation properly.
---
Yeah, some dude who's in the dark about his future might not be thinking straight. But the senior management who've known about these job cuts for some time, are responsible for community engagement, and made the decision to pull a stream without making sure everyone was notified properly? 
---
You don't think they deserve some criticism that they were unprofessional in how they handled this?
---
And even if we agrees those responsible were unprofessional. So what? Chuck it on the "post implementation review" pile of things to improve for next time. I'm not sure why it's being treated like it's a direct attack on employees in their darkest hour. 
---
That's being melodramatic.
---
It’s also certain we will see the WvW Restructuring update to
---
I know that you can exchange your 32 slot bags for account bound ones, there's a merchant called Yonca directly northeast of amnoon waypoint.
---
go [here](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.show=locked) and plug-in your api key with proper permissions
---
it shows the achievements you have yet to complete but sorted based on how many people have done them(meaning the easier/faster ones are likely at the top)
---
&gt; You dont create big new maps and expansive story instances with just a skeleton crew.
---
Well apparently you don't create sustainable content and hype to retain players with those either so... Whatever this "crew" is, skeleton/maintenance or big team, what we - *the players* - see from the outside and are given to play with is too little to feel confident about the future of GW2.
---
The colleagues got laid off, they didn't die.
---
Because ranging a distant enemy with super high damage is a fair fight, right?
---
Is there any reason that ls5 or ls6 can't be cantha?
---
Alternatively, we could make a fundraiser to acquire Arenanet from NC-Soft. In order to do so we can set up a foundation (Stiftung) under german law, which allows us to acquire Arenanet, hold it and promote the care and wellbeing of their employees. This is not a moneymaking move as profits generally stay within the company, but it prevents the studio from being closed unless it actually fails.
---
I could have made this post half a year ago... The only resemblance of a roadmap they have given us for the entirety of Season 4 was the "No XPack - S4 to S5" 5 minute video... 
---
If anything this situation will actually finally get us an open statement again from Mike O'brien, similar to (when Colin Johanson left after HoT Launch)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/48zlyd/im_mike_obrien_here_with_gw2_dev_team_ama/]
---
You can duo them with a friend who has an elite spec, though. That's how I did all my story dungeons. Solo runs are possible but you need to really know your class and build for it, they're hard.
---
Vista Viewer can be done in major cities. Gatherer can be done in home instance (see: major cities). Mystic Forger can be prepped beforehand or bought from TP (can be cheap or expensive depending on what you want). From there, there are minutia you can do to optimize other dailies, but it depends on a lot of factors, such as what you prefer, what server you're on (WvW), and other things.
---
The 3-5 minutes is hyperbole, but if you discount loading time, it's generally accurate.
---
I mean, if they ask, what am i supposed to do here: Just follow commander, teamspeak,.....
---
If they ask , hey i'm on this class what do i do. I'm gona tell them whole idea of what they have to do, full build and stuff like that,...
---
If they want to be on ranger i'm gona say, relog.
---
But if someone starts with drama or says, oh i'm just here for that legendary thing or something, than yea, i'm gona say GTFO.
---
But even capitalists have called the shareholder class out for their parasitical conduct! See Ford vs. Dodge (1919), which is where a lot of today's misunderstanding comes from, that a company is completely beholden to its shareholders. Truth is, a company can invest to stay competitive in the future, and it must do so to not become outdated.
---
But for some reason the wealth extracting class has become too entitled. What happened to the country that wanted to trust in god? Why are Americans taught to worship investors and mammon, who is teaching them that money is somehow more important than everything else? Has no one taught them that money is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself?
---
10/10
---
Extremely wild and unfounded conspiracy theory: They tried to use their current engine for their new projects, including the mobile ones, and it just didn't work.
---
Closer to the Stars.  It was a fun time picking up GW1 in the long hiatus before Heart of Thorns.  I'm still casually working towards Legend of the Mists &amp; Champion of the Gods, but Closer to the Stars was my first big original goal; going back to the roots of GW2. 
---
I'm already planning to try out FFXIV and ESO in light of these awful news.
---
And if i enjoy those games, well, Anet just lost a whale.
---
thats not a guardian there is no aegis hovering around her
---
Still reading, but:
---
&gt; In the first half of 2016 GW2 saw a 6-month long content drought due to a priority reorganization which took many developers and set them to work on Heart of Thorns.
---
You mean 2015? HoT Came out in Oct 2015.
---
Well, you have the good innocent plants
---
Midway plants who don’t want anything to do with their weird siblings
---
And cranky rotten edgy plants who like to torture people
---
And those Mordrem plants but we don’t talk about them
---
It’s a good time 
---
Honestly, what they need to do is completely overhaul dailies. The current PvP dailies are okay, but they could add more each day. My problem with the PvE dailies is that they don't really encourage people to stick around in the maps and do events. Sure, there are event dailies in particular PvE zones, but who wants to sit around and comb the map for 3 separate events when the reward is a karma flask (basically useless currency for most players at this point), a 1/20th of a Tome Of Knowledge, and a Resonating Sliver, which pretty much sit in your bank until you have to vendor them because they're useless outside of scribing. Daily rewards are utter crap. The system doesn't even remotely incentivize healthy population distribution or player engagement and it's very antiquated at this point. So much of the daily reward and achievement system needed an overhaul years ago. Some of the login rewards are crap too. Let me pick what I get each day and remove useless rewards like the gear boxes or essences of luck.
---
Rubi was on vacation this past week, so i was a little surprised to hear a livestream had actually been scheduled. Doesn't she usually host them?
---
Why?  
---
The GW2 was untouched, things will remain the same.  
---
Or... will they have to focus more on GW2 perhaps?  
---
That's why GW 2 was nothing like GW 1. Many of the top founding devs left Arenanet before GW 2 was out.
---
Everyone! Come! Death good!
---
so that was a fucking lie
---
A lot of this info has been debunked. Update your resources and take a look at some references [here.](https://www.epi.org/publication/why-america-needs-a-15-minimum-wage/)
---
Getting “Avenger of the Dispossessed” felt good all those years ago, especially when I did it without a guide and with subpar English skills.
---
I was going to post and explain inflation since OP seems very ignorant. But this saved me a lot of typing. Thanks.
---
Alright, I'm starting to get into WvW so I'm just dumping questions here
---
Does anybody know if [this is a viable build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Spellbreaker_-_Daggerbreaker_Roamer) currently. It's a spellbreaker roamer build. I've got a warrior, which I'm trying to use to learn to roam (per somebodies recommendation here)
---
Exactly this.
---
They overhyped several times when expansions were anounced or other things were implemented and it was always oversold, which in return made a lot of people feeling jaded and disenchated.
---
Not a good thing. Especially because people will realize, if enough was delivered to justify the craze.
---
Can you do them for fun without competing? Would love to see it
---
Try full plaguedoctor firebrand axe/torch and mace / shield with Balthazar runes, you can freely switch between dps and healer on the spot, plus f2 burst heal, and the build generally is very capable.
---
I like D/P and shortbow for mobility like the sPVP Daredevil builds.  It doesn't really matter that much.  P/P isn't objectively speaking a good weapon, but if you want to just kite and spam unload go for it until you wear yourself out xP
---
I'm not in-game right now , but is it an outfit option for wardrobe unlocks?
---
Getting the "Light in the Darkness" title. Completing the instanced achievement solo was frustrating that I remained with the title for a long time before eventually changed to Kingslayer. 
---
It has pretty much zero multiplayer content, that's what's wrong.
---
I just bought some random mount contracts, because I enjoy the occasional gamble...didn't do too bad. I also bought the raven helm which I've been looking at for a while.  I don't usually go out of my way to spend money but if I see something I like, I'll pick it up. Still the cheapest hobby I've ever had. 
---
How can you forget something like this?
---
Holy shit, how many people here are kids who haven't ever had a job in their entire lifes?
---
Amazing as always!
---
Going from 3g to 1000g in a week. Then proceeding to waste it all. :D
---
Yes, I am serious. There is a world out there, you know, where nobody really cares about your personal feelings.  
---
Price of free speech? People who will flame you for everything. Is this bad? For sure, but it is the way it is. As company and employee you have to be able to handle that.  
---
Tough times? Yes. But again. In business nobody cares. Either you deliver or you get even more fucked.  
---
Anet had an easy way out: cancel it way before. Not 3 hours after due time. Yet the missed again 
---
You're not getting fired, you're getting laid off.
---
This kind of attitude, though, is the perfect excuse to actually fire you with no monetary compensation at all.
---
Only problem i have with FFXIV is the slow combat due to the global cd being super high. Does that get better in the endgame?
---
Was cancelled.
---
More like ArenaNet shooting itself in the foot after years and years of bad decisions.
---
Stop blaming NCSOFT for everything.
---
To my knowledge, I'm very sure Mike O'Brien was really important to the development for Blizzard's earlier work - he was a lead programmer and developed a lot of the 3D and rendering formats for Blizzard's games. to sell him as a businessman takes away from his roots, tbh.
---
oh shoot I wrote 'u' unintentionally!! :'(
---
I sympathise with them a lot. This stream could have been an opportunity to clear a lot of the worries with the mount and out the WvW community at ease, but at the same time, they must all be going through quite a tough time right now. Don’t know where I stand on this one
---
How much tho? 
---
10g isn’t enough to make me open my mail
---
Well the shit show was justified, and a hard to moderate chat clearly isn’t the reason as they were going to have this livestream no matter what WvWers thought, cause that’s the only way to clear the air. This is obviously due to the recent layoff announcement
---
;_;
---
I wish I knew what their side project was...
---
Didn’t they say that their live service model was unsustainable though? I think it’s quite naive to assume NO gw2 devs were payed off
---
Upgraded from a HD7770 to a1080ti I could set graphics higher but honestly frames where still low. 
---
Upgraded from a 4440 to a 8086k, frames where nice and high but still tanked to sub 20 in zergs running at 4.4ghz. 
---
OCed 8086K to 4.7ghz and got another ram stick(dual channel now) and saw a pretty big difference I get stable 40 fps in zergs and over a 100 anywhere else. 
---
The next thing that made a good difference in terms of smoothness was getting a gsync monitor. 
---
O'Brien Has a file format named after him.  Calling him just the business guy is disingenuous.  Alot of people making comments lately don’t seem to know the company history between Anet and Ncsoft.  Most of these guys left after getting put in more business focused positions at NCsoft so they could work on other projects. They all have aspects of these, they just drifted in different directions. 
---
Trying to paint them into specific roles to feed the current narrative doesn’t really work.  If anything anet has never really had the straight up businessman.  That’s why it’s such a strange bird of a developer. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. 
---
 I will say the three of them together led to making my favorite game ever (gw1) so they are my Voltron.
---
Single core IPC more specifically.
---
A newer CPU like the 9600K would be better than OPs at the same frequency.
---
2600K however is still decent when overclocked these days.
---
Yur pretty much never gonna face more than 1 vet at a time while levelling, it's totally fine to whip out P/P and Unload them to death.
---
Nothing in Core Tyria where yu spend yur time levelling will require the need for Black Powdering due to how most mobs are essentially made of Tofu.
---
Pistol Whip to cleave mobs, Unload on anything which needs to be kited.
---
It really doesn't get any easier than this.
---
Being in the top 2% of player kills in PvP.
---
As much as I want to sympathise, I find it hard to do so, they’re a multi million dollar company, and it’s a corporate environment. If someone directly planned to be in the livestream was also laid off, I think that would be a justifiable reason. However, since they’ve given us no reason, it’s up to us to speculate wether this was due to an emotional break or a practical one.

They are not alone! Twitter is a quite wholesome place at the moment. Most notably for me [Tripwire offered](https://twitter.com/TripwireInt/status/1099017168681869312) (Killing Floor, Killing Floor 2, Red Orchestra, ...) to help out.

Anna Megill from [Ubisoft/Massive](https://twitter.com/cynixy/status/1098825881546645504) did the same.

Also a never ending stream of links to job listings is appearing below [a twitter post of Anet's Jennifer Scheurle](https://twitter.com/Gaohmee/status/1098998794153123840).
---
The comments range from honest, sympathetic and authentic offers to people just linking to career pages. It's still nice to see game developers standing together trying to make the harsh industry a more friendly place.
---
Dude, me too. Especially PoF felt very polished and, well, like a self-contained world. Of course it could've been better for many reasons, but at least it was nicely designed. 
---
Living world episodes are too short to tell a story nicely and they don't bring a lot of new content that I would want to spend my time on.
---
I agree with you, I work in software dev and a couple years ago a big partner we have had for over 15 years decided to end our partnership as they bought a company similar to ours. Anyway we had to lay people off. It was crappy and surprising but those that had customer, partner, support meetings still held them and attended them as expected. This is the nature of business. The fact ANet first dropped the mount news which they had to know would elicit a negative reaction from a larger number of WvW players then they cancel the stream barely ahead of time is extremely unprofessional and shows really how much they care about the community.   
---
Yeah it sucks when lay offs happen but that is part of business and the customer should not be effected by it. 
---
I only once saw an Anet dev on a EU WvW map (not playing WvW that reguar tbh). I managed to kill him and get \[a hidden achievement\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Community#Conquer\_the\_Creator](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Community#Conquer_the_Creator)) :-)
---
Mine would have to be super-clearing every story achievement from season 2, HoT, and season 3, with the only help I ever got on the instanced areas being a full party for migraine (because obviously)
---
You can cheese a lot of the season 2 achievements, but the only one I needed to abuse was killing the dragon champion without getting hit by its ground attacks (done by being downed every time it wound up for those) because my ping at the time just wasn't up to the task.
---
if its not worth for you, just dont do it then.
---
Wym I stand with people? It’s a game, and also a serious corporate environment, the same as every other workplace
---
Bearbow ranger
---
Use longbow and any bear pet, all the bears have the same tankiness although brown bear can cure conditions to have even more survivability. The bear will tank for you while you pewpew from afar
---
It’s not the highest dps ranger build by far but it’s the best in this situation
---
With full bersekers you can delete trash mobs with 2 and 5. Send the bear in to aggro the mobs, wait for them to group up then kill them
---
Druid’s damage is even lower. Soulbeast is bad if you don’t merge but then you lose the pet so core ranger is what would work best for you
---
More like finished his first udacity tutorial
---
To be fair, sitting was more on the art/animation team. 
---
Build templates are definitely more taxing on the development/programming side.
---
going by statements from Anet GW2 and 1 services won't be affected you can read it here. https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-02-21-arenanet-reportedly-bracing-for-mass-layoffs its in the update part.
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure they pinned it pretty definitively on the stealth segment of the story, where the sight-line checking of mobs for the player / other situations was a quadratic-complexity problem that blew up once the playerbase hit it. 
---
Doesn't it mean we're talking about some serious cuts here? I mean, an experienced programmer would very likely point out that this complexity is going to blow up the servers.
---
&gt;zombies don't exist
---
Cordyceps fungus would like a word.
---
There will be a "last time" you play any game. If you find the game enjoyable, why not play until you get to that point?
---
Yeah, I think I was trying to run before I could crawl and using the more complicated builds, when I could have used bear/bow. 
---
That's correct, you can get enough from just runes and sigils now, since signet of inspiration is not effected by boon duration currently. 
---
Thanks a ton! I’m already starting to get a flow to it (I was able to survive against a few players for more than a few seconds!) I’ll mess around with what works for me! 
---
The inspiration definitely helps. I don’t see a lot of warriors out in wvw so it’s nice to see that it’s usable. The countering aspect is also a lot of fun 
---
Thanks. What is ICYMI?
---
Hmm, I thank you then. Guess I go bacl to berry farm then for the Diviner stats ^^
---
yeah, you only need a couple pieces of it I would say.  Honestly I get away with only berserker/assassin just fine, but maybe a few pieces will help out.
---
Really really well done!!! 
---
Much good!
---
Maybe visit WvW from time to time and you will realise the kind of lag that already exists. Pve mount racing? Lmao. 
---
I got my account recovered after years , without my serial key.
---
Up until this point i generally thought all of there resources were going to guild wars 2. With a small team for gw1.
---
You’re a bad person and should feel bad. 
---
&gt; Confused Banana has been added to Qadim's menagerie
---
hmmmm....
---
There is a direct statement that the reason is cancellation of unannounced projects. Just see the link above or article on the reddit front page. 
---
I really like open world in HoT, but I feel that this expansion changed the game too much. I mean, I hate it that they've locked a lot of lore behind raids. I hate the chronojail. I hate how they've decided to put dungeons in maintenance mode. Furthermore, that expansion felt rushed, despite the fact that we've been waiting for it for many months.
---
But honestly, I'd take HoT or PoF over Living World. I just love to see a story which actually progresses over time. 
---
I don't play plate classes, or chronomancer, so take this as you will. I like playing a bunker scrapper. Hammer, inventions, alchemy, Scrapper. Healing turret, elixir gun, Elixer S (Idk if it is still good, but I know the stealth was what I used it for the most anyway, so it should still be useful), Open slot (rocket boots unless I had a specific plan in mind) and stealth gyro. Use stealth for stomps and escapes. Spin the point. Be annoying. Additionally, you can support your allies through stealth, healing, and rezzes. So you kinda have a taunt that works in pvp (since they can't see anyone but you). I wouldn't try it in ranked or anything, but I love messing aroudn with it.
---
I completed every HoT achievement (including LWS3). Now working on PoF ones. I finally did 100 times tarir yesterday lol.  
---
For PoF I'm stuck at some in Jahai bluffs and the dragon weapons of thunderhead peaks.
---
&gt;O'Brien Has a file format named after him
---
What file format? 
---
Asura master race!
---
&gt; This is all aside from the development time put into mounts instead of core issues.
---
The mount tech was already in place, so it was mostly the art designers and the people figuring out the details of implementation. Would those really be able to help with many WvW issues?
---
Oh yeah, thanks.
---
What exactly is a F2P meta? And who said that GS is F2P meta? 
---
On a Power Warrior double Axe is the highest Dps Weapon as i checked last time. GS is ofc playable as secondary weapon (if cc is not needed) but not even close to Axe Axe dmg. 
---
You should teach economics to the dumbasses of my generation
---
I have thrown away so many Empyreal Fragments in the past years and just now started crafting ascendeds... had to go FARM these, unbelievable
---
well, there is a thing called stealth.. 
---
Greatsword is never more damage than axe/axe.
---
like really! who cares ? such a massive waste of time. We raid sellers do it every day pfft. 
---
Because Axe/Axe is better. What exactly do you mean by F2P Warrior meta? For open world builds there's no such thing as meta and in fractals greatsword isn't used in the standard build.
---
Man, people are so dramatic over this...
---
Then start researching on classes and see which ones fit you, everyone has different preferences. You can either check all traits/skills on wiki or test them in pvp lobby.
---
Its this simple ncsoft and arena net had lots of projects in production. Projects got delayed. Gw2 is profitable and lw seasons are profitable. Management decided to pull expansion resources to try and push out other project development. But this didnt work as more delays end not in sight. Parent company decides to cut its losses. Cancels a large number of projects and lays off redundant positions between two companies to merge them into 1. They are keeping all of the gw2 staff since it is profitable. They will probably switch out employees and push 1 or 2 of their projects closest to completion. 
---
We may even see support for gw2 up tick in the coming months as borrowed resources are returned. Gw2 is fine. 
---
Hmm try to understand in a different light, the company wants to thrive by downsizing a little - their quarter sales are higher.
---
You have to understand this in a more objectivity. Anet also released a statement saying, the people who are laid off are extra project workers that isn't related to gw2. I don't know why you're making a lot of fuss.
---
If anything, you'd help supporting the devs by investing in them. At the end of the day, the only thing that should concerns you as a customer is pull out when you're not having fun.
---
If you're really concerned at the very individuals who work at the company, then invest time to get to know someone from within - that is if you have the time and energy.
---
Trust me, every company that has globally shared stocks and working under an bigger company will always have the pressure to achieve goals and meeting the quota, Anet is the same. Having an increased revenue for this quarter means it's far from dying. News like Anet cannibalised by ncsoft anet up for the bidding means, the company has failed the world and it's investors.
---
Then again if you're talking about the future direction of the company, not the company's health, then that's a hairy issue to discuss. Speculations has it that some want an expac worthy story delivered at a different cover to increase sales vs living story episode with the same quality of story.
---
In the eyes of a business person, you're asking, drop an expac to 200k active users at 60 USD (Median for price) or 4 LS story @ 5 USD each (so 20 USD) with lower risk (free fo active users). Expac HoT + content drought and horribly late patch lost almost half of the population whereas PoF at least 70% of active users to get it on the day of release - stakes are higher. Hypothetically, 12 mil USD to 4 mil USD, respectively assuming active users buy the expac vs non active users buy the 4 LS eps in the same given year. 
---
Sorry for this getting longer than expected
---
tl;dr
---
- Anet, the company's health is far from dying
---
- having to work under a bigger company sucks at times cuz you need to spread thin with some employees to work on other projects in the sidelines
---
- game's direction is wish washy since 2012
---
- company's not always lucky with risk taking (expac vs continue LS)
---
Probably because GS has both damage and mobility while axes offer mostly damage.
---
Before anyone does anything else please get up to date and read this :D

Thanks for the info, I’ll give them a try.

Oh right the temples, when I first went through Orr they were a pain in the ass so I shunned them from my memory :P But now I guess I can give them another try.

I hope the cancelled project wasn't GW2 Expansion 3.

Probably you were not the only one assuming the worse so she made the clarification :p

Agreed.  They still had a job to do.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPQ_(file_format)

**MPQ (file format)**
---
MPQ (Mo'PaQ, short for Mike O'Brien Pack, named after its creator), is an archiving file format used in several of Blizzard Entertainment's games.
---
MPQs used in Blizzard's games generally contain a game's data files, including graphics, sounds, and level data. The format's capabilities include compression, encryption, file segmentation, extensible file metadata, cryptographic signature and the ability to store multiple versions of the same file for internationalization and platform-specific differences. MPQ archives can use a variety of compression algorithms which may also be combined.

Even Aurora Peachy did, so not the only one xD
---
I'm glad they learned from HoT, because I hate HoT and avoid those maps whereas I love season 3 maps and play them a lot.
---
You might not have job soon and worry about what comes next in life. Btw do a fun stream and put on a happy face.
---
Seriously you can just play the game on tuesday and see for yourself what the mount brings.
---
Greatsword looks cooler on f2pers backs.
---
But dual axes are more damage at the cost of aesthetics.
---
"I don't play this game (anymore or never have) and need to feel better about quitting / need an excuse to quit" is what it is 90% of the time.
---
I have seen some people use blender to make the models look MUCH better, so isn't possible to refine with blender then port to sfm?
---
It's what YOU said.
---
The guy above mentioned WoW and FFXIV and it was you that said it was fine that a live service can have a playerbase that only plays every few months and can retain player interest as well as them.
---
I meant the refining requirements, you donut. Remember how recipes got modified by ANet's "expert", so leather and cloth market got more fucked than a porn star before Valentines?
---
Imagine this - to make a sandwich you need a slice of bread, a slice of ham, and a slice of cheese (no mayo, because you've already had mayo sandwich today, and it resets on midnight). Now because some dumbass had a bad day, you suddenly have to make it with 5 slices of bread, and it will *miraculously* produce the same size sandwich as before. Oh, and you can't bake your own bread, no - you have to either buy it (at an insane price), or rob other people and hope they have their pockets full of dough.
---
&gt; I can't even compare the quality of the game on release to what it is now.
---
I mean quality is decent, what we lack is quantity. At least in my opinion. With the amount of content we get per episode, there should be one every month to keep people invested in this game.
---
Same goes for raids and fractals. Honestly. Since heart of thorns, which changed the fractals system (for worse, in my opinion) we had 6 new added fractals and a couple of good(and bad) reworks. It's been 3.5 years since then. 42 months. That means 7 months per fractal. Excuse me, but that is *unacceptable* considering that fractals is your daily endgame content.  
---
Raids tell the same story. We currently have 6 wings in the same time. Honestly, it should be like 3-4 times as many.
---
Is there any evidence that they haven't been working on an expansion? 
---
Haha, I have that too and love it for my chronomancer &lt;3
---
I made nevermore slowly over the course of about two years and logged every single fucking plank of wood needed for it myself. The only things I TP’d were the totems and bloods etc. because I’m a glutton for punishment, I’m slowly doing the same process for Binding of Ipos.
---
The most they'll touch the gw2 team is laying off marketing staff, who are incredibly replaceable anyways. NCSoft is mad at ArenaNet for trying to do non Guild Wars stuff, which is also why we've been getting these content droughts, for us the layoff should be a good thing and mean we'll get the next episode sooner.
---
I thought Axe/Axe was meta on a core warrior build?
---
They’ve never said no gw2 were being laid off, they simply said development wouldn’t be impacted. On top of that, they’ve been keeping up the illusion of a similar sized gw2 development team for the past few months, so I’m sure it wouldn’t be hard for them to continue gw2 development while laying off more people. After all, Jessica price did say how a big part of her job was to make it seem like the dev team was the same size and producing the same amount of content, when in actuality, it decreased as people transferred to upcoming projects
---
You're still complaining about that? That was years ago. Just pretend that refining leather has always required more. Do you remember when think leather was worth less on the TP than its vendor value? THAT was a sorry state for the market.
---
It's not about whether it's profitable or not, it's HOW profitable it is.
---
I do not want a DPS meter in the game, if it's an optional addon that's fine, but forced into the game would not be something I'm interested in. From your previous posts it seems like you're saying that people that don't like min-maxing ALSO enjoy dps meters and I was disagreeing with that point. I believe you THINK you don't like min-maxing but seeing as how you would very much desire a DPS meter in game I could conclude that you do like it but not on a conscious level. So I don't see the agreement or misplacement.
---
Lmao, I already have all of the gifts from those maps in my bank... Wow I'm stupid.  
---
Thanks again :P. Saving me time!
---
Does it have to be?
---
One of the silver linings of an industry like this - as bad as it is for the companies themselves and their workers - is that you're always in demand.  Moving companies every few years becomes part of the job expectation.  Do I wish it was better, more stable? Of course! But I'd be willing to bet there are few - if any - creative / media companies that do not have that kind of shuffling profile.  It's just the nature of the work being done.
---
Lets say this is someone not credible and is making this stuff up. What do you think the aim of the poster is...nothing better to do but defend GW2 even though the developer is having a bad time right now?
---
No as per usual Anet say one thing the community takes it as something really some friendly advice unless you read it from Anet or a gaming news site like IGN or MMORPG who have done interviews with a devs don't believe what the community tells you and if you are going to do anything ask for evidence.
---
You're wrong, axe/axe is meta for core warrior. Greatsword used to be.
---
I just informed you that the firings didn't happen yet (I may have just killed English but it's not my first language). If you want to sympathize or not it's up to you. One possibility is that higher ups decided to settle with firings first then proceed as planned. Personally the only problem I found with the cancellation is that they didn't inform people earlier that it was cancelled.
---
I've recently returned after 5 years and last I remeber doing was completing the Scarlet Living World.
---
To be completely honest I have no idea on what to do next other than order the expansions and the Last Living World I missed and complete them all.
---
Crafting wise I left all of the professions at 400+ I think I was doing Exotic gear? are those still worth the investment?
---
What do you guys think I should honestly do? to reintegrate myself on this game I'm starting to love once more.
---
Other than the general cluelessness of mine what changed over the years while this game aged fairly well.

Wasn't blizzard just stopped supporting esports scene for hots and just kept only the necessary staff for skins and balance? That's how I really remember the announcement. And I saw recently new skins. Or they kept staff only for skins? Just asking cause I didn't follow it up closely just read what blizz said and moved on.
---
Why not make it 100g or 1000g sure it won't change a thing.
---
Maybe at ArenaNet, they do. Or maybe there was another reason for it to be cancelled that you don't know about. Try, just for a moment, to think like a reasonably-educated adult about the situation.
---
You know only two things: Layoffs were announced, and the stream was cancelled after a long delay. That's not enough information for you to make any sort of judgements.

Capitalism it's a business people are not supposed to to empathize with a corporation. Corporations are not people you support or cast aside solely with your wallet. Their demise has nothing to do with use but the choices that they make as a corporation. If anything false feedback from the fandom could be to blame as we see with the official forums they worship every action they take and bash constructive criticisms. Its not healthy for the individual or the business for either one to pretend they are friends. As an American this is the most basic of stances I don't know where your from so I wont judge it's just an unhealthy stance.

I go to HOT maps for the metas , but I NEVER go there just to hang out or do solo content , because I hate them. Are they creative visually , and from a design stand point ? Yes , they are. Are they fun ? No , they're awful.

Not that I am required, or even inclined to educate you, but the reason we are so popular is because we are superior to all other races. The reason humans are more "popular" is because they are the best general use servants, and for every Asuran character I create, I create 3 humans to serve him.

I finished The Wayfarer's Henge, Aurora 1: Awakening, Bioluminescence, and The Bifrost (my first legendary) all last week. It made me really happy! I've had all of those achievements and items sitting, almost complete, for a long time.

I'm planning on going for The Best Offense next. I still need a good amount of the Requiem armor skins, but I really want that ascended armor piece and title! I also need to save up to actually finish Aurora, because that's gonna be expensive.

Greatsword is used for mobility I think. Don't really play warrior but I watche da guide to help my bro out, and I think it said always use a greatsword for mobility, if you need mobility, or something like that.
---
Good ideas , there . That's actually what I would like to see.
---
Yeah you can get 250g for like not even a hour of real time work
---
This is probably the thing I'm most proud of, too! HOPE was easily the legendary I wanted the most (my engi main was pistol/pistol at the time), so it ended up being the very first legendary I made. I still love how it looks, and I don't see a lot of them around... but I'm so proud of the work I put into it.
---
working a minimum wage job and converting it to greens still gets you gems faster than any farming method, so this is technically true
---
Me too (i'm in Chile) I did have login and connection issues all week long, until i managed to solve by doing these in order
---
1) Setting in my connection properties 8.8.8.8 as primary DNS and 8.8.4.4 as secondary
---
2) Doing a dns cache flush (ipconfig /flushdns on Windows)
---
3) Fully power cycling my router
---
Did that and recovered the ability to play, so the problem was in my end. Hope this helps you too.
---
Oh I totally get that. With all things that have a gold/gem value associated with it it's a good way to have a rough estimate. Achievements/game completion etc are totally different 
---
I'm gonna guess 20k ?
---
Total fanboy response lol.

That is not how gw2efficiency, and GW2 api for that matter, works xD

please enlighten me as to how someone would be able to "hack" my gw2 account based on my permanently changing account value, and my reddit account name alone. i'm curious how this scenario would play out in your mind.

Mounts in WvW could function as a mobile siege like Golems.  I don't see a problem with that.
---
wait... what do Sylvari eat? They even eat? Or they use the sun as plants do? 
---
I do think reasonably. I think the people at ArenaNet are human beings, not machines preprogrammed to serve my whims, and that I don't know what's going on there in the wake of recent announcements. I think things don't happen without a reason, and that my not knowing the reason doesn't mean there isn't one.
---
If they cancelled the stream, there was a reason for it. If it took them three hours to say so, there was definitely a reason for that as well. Do I know what the reasons are? No, I don't. Does that invalidate those reasons? No, it does not. Do any of these events cause me any kind of harm? No, they do not. As such, is there any reason for me to get upset or angry or to throw eggs at ArenaNet? **No, there is not.**
---
So tell me, why don't ***you*** think reasonably?

What is Undead Labs working on? The State of Decay franchise isn't really taking off.
---
Off-meta is great, so long as you’re good with the build. Staying off meta can be really powerful, as most players only expect the meta builds, and often don’t know how to react to a well designed/played off-meta build. 
---
This doesn’t mean play a crappy build, but there are amazingly useful builds just outside of the meta, you want to find that sweet spot of usefulness and obscurity.

Just to add, it's either axe/axe + gs (for pure dps) or axe/axe + mace/mace (for cc). You almost never lose the axe/axe on core warrior builds.

Killing Tequatl solo pre Tequatl Rising re-work back in the days when world bosses used to stay until defeated and waaaaaaaaaaaaay before mega-server ever existed. Took a long VERY long time rom appearance to kill (around 40 min if memory serves) but boy this felt like a real achievement!
---
Everyone i know has left the game, LWS are tolerable provided an expansion waits at the end of them. Right now I'm not confident in the future of gw2 and have chosen to spend my time and money elsewhere as a result.

420k on main, maybe another if we count twink accounts aswell

Hope not.

Can you not tell us exactly what you said? Like this post means nothing.

What I often saw was one person make a decision, then someone else take over three weeks later and reverse it. And I saw people argue that black was white to justify doing something that they wanted to in the face of numbers to the contrary. I came to the conclusion very early on that personal opinion was at least as important as bald facts; I never changed that view.
---
Am I correct in thinking that EoTM raises both WvW rank (from wxp) and reward track (e.g. the Gift of Battle one), but not other rewards ( the skirmish rewards)?
---
I gather it's much less busy as the rewards are lower, so if the Warclaw is unlocked by Reward Track or buying the skills by ranking up that would be a good place to divert casuals and newbies to. 
---
As a PvE commander in going to spend some time next week, I will try to direct PvE players to EoTM as this seems the least disruptive. 
---
*passes some acknowledgement*. Now can we move on. 
---
They can probably sense it more acutely from the exposed plant hormones/chemicals in the air.
---
Why do you think NCSOFT went and randomly decided to cancel two projects?
---
Maybe it wasn't a random decision, you know.
---
Yeah you would be correct :) However I think 'less busy' is an understatement as it was absolutely empty last week, everything was just plain white. But yeah if the Warclaw has anything to do with it it would be cool to go there
---
i think double axe can look better esp. on norn or char
---
This is all pretty wild speculation, that I don't really think reflects any real numbers. Guild Wars 2, FF, and ESO have all been pretty closely tied in popularity and continue to be so. And especially Neverwinter, even with expansions, is far behind Guild Wars 2. Guild Wars 2 is not, in reality, lagging behind anything. Yeah, it doesn't have an expansion announced, by Path of Fire isn't that far ago, and the living world model seems to be immensely successful for ArenaNet. Despite the news, there have never been signs of the game struggling outside of maybe poor structuring and management  in specific cases. Do I want an expansion? Yes. Do I think it would help the game a lot? Sure, but I don't think it's needed to prevent the game to fade into obscurity any time soon. 
---
It needs to be made a novelty item. 
---
I was looking around there just before I made that post and didn't see anything like that. You can see comparisons between total achievements, but not individual ones.
---
But even if it is there, I wouldn't mind it being in game too. First of all, I doubt gw2e has a very good representation of more casual players. Besides that, I think it would increase player activity as well. Imagine seeing an achievement that only 5% of the player base has and you don't have it. For a lot of people, that would probably make them want to at least attempt it, if not go all out and earn it.
---
Anet devoting coders to update the engine to make use of dx12 optimizations.
---
I’d agree with this, but bandwagoning is already a big enough problem as is currently. If they can make fair match-ups I would be for it. 
---
you cant do overtime on all jobs tho
---
whahhhhh
---
Shit, now I really might jump back in to it. Have been seriously thinking about since news of the new xpac came out.
---
You greedy b*tch. That's going to ruin the economy.
---
Just because Person A likes the story and doing checklist achievements, doesn't mean Person B, C , and D do. That argument goes nowhere.
---
What about DR?
---
you fractal is definitely worth doing daily, i recommend to get a static group where you can do cm+t4 in 30-40 min.
---
don't forget to always buy deeply discounted keys aswell
---
Yeah, how do you market
---
NEW STORY CONTENT.

ACHIEVEMENTS
---
I want ways to force or incentivise a zerg to split. Right now, it is far too easy for a single massive zerg to attack and defend huge portions of the map. The increase in movement speed with gliding and soon mounts would make the problem worse.
---
wish there was a bot that deleted this comment
---
That's true. And the poster mentioning Utopia was right - there is a chance we will find out sometime. 
---
now that i think about it..wouldn't ~~intel~~ vision sigil make more sense instead of transference? 
---
harrier has tons of power but no precision and those 3s of guaranteed crits could do wonders in pulling a big barrage or just to kill the prides faster
---
I’d love to see more incentives to run smaller havoc groups over giant zergs.
---
Zergs can be fun but I find the experience to be a lot better when it’s havoc teams fighting each other imo.
---
It would also be nice to get a good WvW balance patch, medium armours get screwed when it comes to grouping which tends to leave as only being able to roam or be a side-hoe to a Zerg. 
---
i think mirage and Scrapper are some of the hardest to kill
---
They have explained that the budget was for marketing. Hosting tournaments instead of ads on taxis.
---
 No? Don’t you play for fun? I will play GW2 until I get bored of it. At the moment, I am not bored of it. Even playing GW1 right now. I couldn’t care less of my progression. I’ll just hope to another game, simple as that. 
---
For sure, but I also mean something more than that, QoS(Quality of Service) especifically.
---
This game runs like shit on most computers. I am no expert in how this game engine works, but I am certain that it has to do on how it fails to use hardware resources. The same computer you could run every other game with over 120 fps, in GW2 it barely reaches 60.
---
Not only they didn't fix the game, they also didn't respect it's limitations, adding a ton of graphic elements that makes the game run even worse in recent maps.
---
If they were siphoning the game's resources(money from the cash shop) to begin with, they should at least have directed it towards fixing the game engine, like FFXIV did after 1.0 failure.
---
I love GW2 and all of it's magnitude, but ArenaNet didn't respect their own creation. All the fractals and raids never released wouldn't have mattered if they had simply used all their power to direct those resources into fixing it's perfomance problems.
---
&gt; had to go FARM these, unbelievable
---
Lol never delete anything unless you're 100% sure you don't need it.
---
Had a buddy ask me wtf Grandmaster Mark Shards were for, (you can use 10 of them to buy an ascended piece of WvW, and you can only get 3 a week). When I told him, he goes, "Shit I just deleted 18 of them last week".
---
6 weeks of Shards down the toilet.
---
Best farm: Getting a side job, spending the extra income on gems, converting gems to gold.
---
No, seriously. Assuming US minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, you can earn 580 gems per hour, which should net you about 130 gold per hour.
---
As a nice bonus side effect, you can then concentrate solely on fun while playing the game.
---
*kiter
---
The Nightmare Court story cancellation explains Chrysanthea's appearance fighting the Mouth of Mordemoth.
---
Yeah, I agree. Would be weird to have the whole first 3 episodes of the season actually amount to nothing besides some meaningless tangent for a beloved villain.
---
Just having a giggle c:
---
“We add capes” “We add build templates”
---
Let the tendies hit the ... FLOOOOOOOOORRRR!!
---
I think scourge could be a nice tank in pvp while still doing more than enough condi damage 
---
I don’t have an exact build in mind but you can provide boons/barriers/boon corruption for enemy and condi cleanse for your team 
---
I’d recommend you check WvW builds for scourge and maybe tune it around a bit for what you need 
---
Probably because you have some outdated information from before some important changes.
---
Axe mastery gives you a lot of ferocity.
---
With Dual Strike you can keep up around 30% uptime on quickness.
---
Judging by the state of the PvP, players did not feel encouraged to get better and outplay mirages, they were encouraged to not do PvP. 
---
&gt; do you really think it is wise to balance after the worst kind of play 
---
Balance according to the majority of players not "the worst kind of plays". People are still getting destroyed by mirages in mid tier as well. As per my comment above, balance should not be done to cater to people at the very top. 
---
Heya I'm back with a correction regarding color-coded commander tags, it must be exclusive to EU. Been asking NA people, comes out they barely use it compared to EU. It's just 5-7 people's response though, so we may still need more insignt :D
---
What did I miss? What new server population concept? Are we talking alliances?
---
Yeah probably, thanks for asking! Ive always been on NA and I never saw them used/mentioned in those 6 years
---
If surviving is your highest priority, Minstrel Druid is a really good option. You'll have good mobility, condition cleanse, stealth access, and burst healing access. However, it doesn't contribute to a group in the same way that a Minstrel Firebrand does. If you want to have a big impact on your allies while still being extremely tanky, I'd 100% recommend that. Minstrel Scrapper is quite good too. 
---
(This would be for WvW only)
---
God damn that's amazing. 
---
That "ex gw2 dev" you talking about should not be taken seriously and everything she says should be tyaken in a large grain of salt. 
---
&gt; work a little overtime
---
I wish my job let me get paid overtime...
---
I'll repeat myself again. I do not care about low or high rankings. **PvP should be balanced for the majority skilled players** and not the outliers that are every high or very low.
---
&gt; i don't pvp at the moment 
---
[Soooo...](https://i.gifer.com/M6cR.gif)
---
&gt; you can't see 
---
I highly assume that's his goal.
---
That is incredible
---
might be a weird interaction with the 5 stack boon cap. fury has a stack cap of 9 so that is probably why fury seems fine while prot/regen are inconsistent
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Effect_stacking
---
Hmm it looks like a minimum wage job still at least twice as good as SW and since the OP didn't set any other conditions ...
---
1. Better balance to open different play styles than (rev+scourge) pirate ship. Personally I would like to see nerf of all damage across the bord - all skills -25% damage output as start. Condi and boon duration should get different curves than PVE - meaning that in order to achieve the same crit damage / boon duration it will require WvW player to invest more in those stats.  
---
2. New set of maps replacing current ones - nothing fancy, without any PVE elements in it - implemented in stages: first very basic blockout styled map (no textures, simple non-final geometry), for next 2-3 weeks keep reading feedback from WvW commiunity and keep iterating layout of those maps until feedback from us will be positive - once people are happy - replace blockout geometry with final art and textures.  
---
3. Rewards on par of what PVE players can earn in their game modes playing for the same amount of time. If our PVE friends can earn their first legendary armor after finishing 150 raids (instead of 300) - same should apply to us - cut requirement of getting 1st set in WvW by 50% please. Buff loot bags - WvW players should get all their crafting material from playing WvW instead of being forced to either farm PvE or buy materials from TP.  
---
4. Might not be very popular opinion (since a lot of players love mix-matching their gear in WvW) but I would love to see PvP-like amulet system but tailored for our game mode - possibly by splitting 1 amulet into 3-5 separate trinkets so we can still do stats mix-matching. This would not only let to having better balance (reducing amount of stats on each trinket could be part of balance patches) but it would open WvW mode to more player currently excluded beacuse of how costly some of the gear is (minstrel for example).
---
They forgot content.
---
My opinion? The trading post.
---
An example via mithril:
---
Buy mithril ores for 71c, make into ingots, list at 1.79s. Buy mithril ingots for 1.43s and sell for 1.79s.  Both are profitable and it moves fast.
---
^ this is just an example, but it’s an example of fast and stupid easy gold available all over the TP.
---
as it stands right now you actually save money by buying it outright..not much though
---
as a side note, people obsess too much with this particular food when avocado smoothies are almost as good and basically free
---
The stack limit and the way the game prioritize them is just weird. I remember escorting a dolyak in WvW and ended up reducing its swiftness duration by giving it more swiftness. -_-
---
Lets all hope it wont be the same outcome.
---
In normal times this would have made me laugh at lot...
---
That's fine, but is the answer to introduce something that's going to completely disrupt the tactics which exist? 
---
I'm 1 off from it. It's one of those achievements I've never noticed until it popped up in my almost completed section. 
---
It's VERY different to say "GW2 won't be affected" and "GW2's game systems won't be affected", which is what Anet stated. I have said this one hundred times already but Epic's Paragon also used a similar statement when the game was going downhill, and it eventually headed into full cancellation. The fact that we're already getting the promised LWS5 doesn't means there is going to be more life after that.
---
I now have 500 Leatherworker on my main
---
English is not my thing lol
---
greatsword is less dps than axe/axe, however:
---
it can be used as an opener for a minor dps gain
---
it's pretty good when you need might, either for yourself or for others
---
it has great mobility for various purposes
---
so it definitely has a place despite mace variations being favoured in the current meta
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uWW--w4SRs Q.E.D.
---
I agree. This way I'd also actually pay. I don't spend any money on the gem store, and I guess many people do if you look at the income graphs.
---
ArenaNet should really focus more on expansions, not less. It's been said by the community since 2012.
---
Don't forget communication. XIV gets multiple live letters before patches actually drop, we actually know what kind of stuff is being worked on because it's not just radio silence until the week before patch day.
---
A kinda subjective/personal one but 4 out of 5k total hours I've played on power staff tempest. First character, emotional attachment, so on. I didn't know I essentially started the game in hard mode compared to let's say necro and ranger mains. 
---
It was in a good place when I just started (2016), then gradually got hit by nerfs, which only made me wanna stick with this spec out of spite. Or pride. Idk. By now I'm pretty proud of doing all story, open world and non-zerg wvw on this one character (and often being the last one standing if my group wipes). Even though I have like 20 other fun and cool alts. :'D
---
Or be competent like every other MMO developer and manage to put out actual patches with major content between expansions. 
---
No prob! Here's a copypaste of some answers I found interesting:
---
- "NA just tears itself apart if there's ever more than two tags at once."
---
- "I play wvw a good amount and there is no color tagged system but I know someone was talking about it in wvw and people thought they were crazy".
---
- "Last server I was on always used yellow for scouts".
---
For a EU player like me it sounds so wild x'DD Especially the yellow scout tag.
---
there is no real majority of skilled players in gw2. there are either those who only pvp since ages and therefore have a high amount of experience or those who play only from time to time...and those are everything, but for sure not skilled.
---
When critiquing someone or something, its always best to talk about how it effects you. Instead of trying to judge why and how it was created, because you don't have that inside view to base it on anything. 
---
So this is about story. I am playing charr and my father is a gladium and I helped him escape. Will he contact me as he said? I am currently doing lvl 60 story and I am afraid he forgot.
---
Thats called Trans-Species Erotica friend...
---
Yea that could definitely work! I just based an idea sans refinement. 
---
Mazerials come from salvaging loot and gatgering nodes in the world. But most of the time you will buy additional materials from the trading post, when you start crafting specific gear.
---
Buy gems and convert
---
By what amount? I am wondering if I should finally switch to axe/axe (I play open world only though so I doubt it matters if GS or axe/axe).
---
download intel extrem tuning utility and try to set clock to 43x instead of 34x works fine for me
---
[https://imgur.com/a/wYRZQSn](https://imgur.com/a/wYRZQSn)
---
Just like the Engineer afk farms. 
---
Why even go after a mount that only works in a game mode u don’t play?
---
I think some people will take part in the following competitions but not as a full squad. Just filling in with friends etc
---
Grenth has return from the mists to save us!
---
TL;DR
---
Yeah some people will take part next month just with friends and stuff.
---
Probably not if it's one of the Soundless
---
prot holo is just as boring as condi mirage tbh
---
ultimate dominator i guess?  
---
I don't play outside of 3 hours 4 nights of the week.  
---
I also play minstrel firebrand which makes it doubly hard to kill people
---
I won't spoil, but in the High Legions parents don't tend to raise their cubs, nor do they stay that much in touch when they grow up.
---
We have no idea who or what downvotes stuff, but a lot of people have commented on this in the past. Nothing we can really do O_o; 
---
This title is the only one I ever worked on :D
---
I've said this in another thread, but the streamers may not have had any control over not only whether they could do it as scheduled, but possibly over whether they could even talk about it. I'm not saying them managing to proceed as planned wouldn't have helped. Neither am I saying that communicating, if they could, about the cancellation wouldn't have helped, either. What I'm saying is that when shit happens, neither thing, though ideal, is always possible. I happen to know this first-hand. I get that not everybody does, but while frustration is understandable, the toxicity is not. 
---
Certain structure upgrades and tactivators are way too strong.  Dragon banner for instance is still ridiculous.  Airship defense, cloaking waters, invuln fortifications, objective aura stat bonuses, etc.  Too many mechanics that allow defenders to delay for a ridiculous amount of time with only a few people.  I really wish people weren't able to hide in structures so often.  I guess that's also up to the playerbase though.  
---
Class diversity is also pretty bad right now.  
---
&gt;2-3 raids and 9-10 fractals a year. New pve endgame every month
---
How many games will the "133t raiderz" destroy before they finally accept that almost no one likes raiding and the small niche that do aren't enough to sustain a game?
---
Oh good lord that burns my retinas.
---
Way to go my dude, I don't raid at all. If anything I do fractals, which is why I'm quite sad about the fact we got 6 new fractals in the same time as 6 raid wings, while taking severely less resources.  
---
Nevertheless are there countless of raiders and people who play at that level are more often than not people who don't take breaks from the game and spend money on gems. So it's really just smart to keep them around.
---
Advertising to customers is business
---
Yeah. But not as a toy.  
---
They should add a 6th novelty category: Tools.
---
It would include all these gizmos that are not just for fun, teleport scrolls or inventory-related, and have actual uses:
---
* Cake gun
---
* White mantle portal
---
* Position rewinder
---
* Brand mining tool
---
* The living story devices like the rift stabilizer, the ley-infused lodestone and Levvi's device, candy corn meter, etc.
---
Then, they should add to WvW a new tool you can buy and unlock as novelty to use it in WvW. It would be a tool to quickly put your siege in your inventory:
---
* Unlock and equip the tool.
---
* Press the novelty button.
---
* Your get a bundle that replaces your skills:
---
* Skills 1 to 7: Flame Ram, Arrow Cart, Ballista, Catapult, Trebuchet, Shield Generator, Siege Golem.
---
* Skills 9 and 0: Switch Between Basic, Superior and Guild siege. 9 will be basic or superior, 0 superior or guild, depending on what's the current one.
---
 * The skills will have an ammo counter that indicates how much of that siege is in the inventory.
---
* Swap weapon button/Novelty button: Unequip the tool.
---
* Skill 8: Placeholder for a possible new siege bluepring.
---
This is not a meta its section for people who struggle with their own content but anything can work in open world as long as you have builds that make sense to you. Boots bad builds for example on YouTube.
---
say that to the 800 blizzard employees who lost their jobs as well LUL
---
I want to be able to use skills even if there three zergs...
---
OP was clearly asking for in-game grinding, not this smartass answer that's so clever that half the commenters said it
---
We can do whatever we want, just like the Anet execs who created this massive PR storm over a product that lives entirely on player goodwill and faith.
---
No one pays me to take care of their business.  When they start a fire, I'm going to think maybe I shouldn't store my cash in that building.
---
I'm not out proclaiming the end, but I'm worried I'm not going to see value for the money I've put in the game, and that needs to change.  Given how freely corporations lie to their markets, that change is going to be very slow, because only actions are meaningful now.
---
Which is why I don't like seeing the stream canceled.  *Canceling* an already planned thing showing off your new stuff is an action, and was easily avoidable (turn off the chat, talk about focusing on what you've got for players to play with).  I hope their future actions look more promising, because I want this product in the market, both for me, for other players, and for its effect on the market.
---
I am not talking abou Anet nor the game itself. I am talking about people having tantrums instead of being emphatic with the people Anet has laid off. Of course people in the company didnt want to do the streaming. When half of your friends and job partners are fired the last thing you want to do is something like that.
---
Ok so you obviously did not read all of this through. It was not meant to come up that day. There was a leak that forced them to tell it that day because the employe found out through that leak and were worried. So obviously Arena Net had planned to make the stuff first and then tell. But this did not happen. At that point they could choose to tell the employe well sorry but we have a job to do so get your asses out there and we talk in a few days. But that would not be very nice consider this is real people and real life, people are loosing their job and it might effect their life in ways we have no knowledge about. So i do not blame them for spending time with them.
---
How ever the last thing you wrote i do agree on. They should have told us early that due to the events today we need to spend time with everybody and can there for not follow through with the stream. I did expect that and think it should have happen, but i can also accept that it must be rather messy at their office at that point and there for they forgot since it is again only hours ago it all came out. So i am not gonna throw a fit over it even though i do think the same thing about that specific subject.
---
Awesome! You guys rock.
---
What the hell? I don't usually care much for the art posts that get upvoted to the front page on a daily basis but this one is fucking breathtaking. I bet he charges a lot, because with talent like this he certainly deserves to be.
---
Can someone give me a quick experience comparison of watching the in-game summary of Living Story 1 versus going on youtube and watching the whole thing?
---
This is simply PR firefighting. They likely expected there would speculative commentary about the layoffs and decided it would get more attention than the planned content of the Livestream, which itself has already been met on the forums with a very mixed reception.
---
Sadly, ingame currency having a certain RL value and infinite amounts being obtainable so long as you have the money is something that all major MMO's have accepted a long time ago. 
---
If they didn't offer it themselves, goldsellers would offer it. 
---
But I am still yearning for an MMO that somehow magically circumvents this. It's impossible, but I would love it. 
---
&gt;repeatable
---
Wait, you can make more than one mawdrey?
---
I remember it taking forever n you can get a a back with winterberries

ULTIMATE MINSTREL FIREBRAND CARRY LORD. Staff + Mace/Shield. I use this build to omega carry my guildmates in fractal cms. The amount of aegis you can output is just stupid.You have alot of consistent healing and burst heals on demand. Also being in minstrel you can survive mechanics other people fail and pick them off the ground instantly with Merciful Intervention. Also you can basically run this in wvw so you dont need to swap gear alot :)
---
A lot of people like raiding actually, but I don't like the ones on GW2. Just because I don't like the ones in GW2 doesn't mean I have any desire to shit on the people that do like them.
---
* Better rewards, but at the same time discourage people from trying jump ship to other worlds or take turn trading wins.
---
* More reasons and better rewards for both taking and maintaining higher tier objectives. 
---
* Toning down the pace of combat without slowing the action.
---
* Encouraging splitting and spreading all over the map.
---
Isnt GvG better suited for SPvP since its controlled groups. WvW doesnt have fixed groups. How would moving GvG from SPvP to WvW improve WvW?
---
The release was more than 6 weeks ago, that's plenty of time to get through the episode's story.
---
Lovely &lt;3
---
If a Sylvari trips in a forrest, does it have an existential crisis immediately after?
---
They might be moved back to GW2. They are doing restructuring *before* doing layoffs. There's a possibility that any devs moved to non-GW2 related projects will be put back on to GW2 and anyone hired solely for the unannounced non-GW2 related projects would be laid off.
---
You nailed it.
