&gt; If anything mounts make this game super easy

---
Too easy.

---
you just have to have 10 competent individuals in a room basicly.

ESO is probably the third most immerse MMO I've played behind the Secret World and Guild Wars 2.  I can't ever immerse myself in quest hubs, not anymore. The thing is, ESO felt like I was running quests and then running back to a quest giver and I don't find that immersive. I couldn't really get lost doing random things when I played ESO, I was always doing something and looking in a quest log. 
---
Here I'm just responding to what I see constantly. I see this, I do it, I get involved, until I see something else. This allows me to be immersed. 
---
We're probably all defining immersion differently.
---
^ this, I feel my gyros just die after just looking at them, it just get to the point of funny and cringe.
---
In my case logs would not even be needed. I got the archievment from compleating the sab hardmode zone but i don't have a single skin from it. 
---
So what happend? Either I deleted the tokens or i sold them for 15 spheres. Nothing else possible. Me deleting a stack of spheres should be enough for them to give me the tokens back. 
---
Esp since they have this silly merchant without conformation window I would have expected they understand but nope. I mean every silly thing has a conformation window (now even changing legy stats) except this merchant. 15 spheres for a token that can take one an eternity...
---
Rushed to 300MF after 7 years in the game. Yeah, sure, makes sense.
---
Kaineng wasn't beautiful, but it wasn't supposed to be. It was a maze like, miasma infected city, ruled by gang fights and it portrayed that beautifully however.  I felt like I was in a rats nest. A warren of disease and poverty and despair that was about to boil over. Was it comfortable? Not at all. But it was very well suited to what it was meant to be.
---
Not only do mounts take away the platforming elements in POF over all, they make it easier to get around in Heart of Thorns as well and even in core Tyria. 
---
One of my guildies hates jumping puzzles and is much happier with the game since the mounts in HOT. She can get places she used to need portals to get to, because she has mounts now. That said, most jumping puzzles don't let you use mounts but some do.
---
not forgetting. just prioritizing frustrations!
---
Damn I swear they fixed that launching bug a while back, it's still there even now?
---
These complaints have persisted since weeks possibly days after it was changed to work like this, ramping up significantly after ecto became salvageable for luck. It's just as needless a request today as it was then.
---
And it doesn't matter how long the option to rush to 300 has existed, someone new rushing to 300 is no different than someone rushing to 300 years ago and complaining about it for years, they intentionally remove the primary use of luck and then demand that they should get something further because they can't use it.
---
Yeah, let's not allow people to give input about features that are completely fucked by default, just because you specifically don't have the item in question.
---
IIrc the whole Joko arc in LS4 weren't planned originally.
---
As a frequenter of both games' subs, I was extremely confused for a minute
---
Switch to intel or ryzen 3600. 120 GB SSD is too low get at least 250 gb, 500 would be nice or more SSD i just upgraded FROM a 250 GB boot drive to 1 TB yesterday since  Windows was getting long in the tooth with my system files hitting 100GB and only had 30 GB left to work with.
---
HDD is fine if you want to install regular things or older games. I think Blue drives take longer to spin up to full speed vs black ones have higher performance.
---
Modern games works best on an SSD
---
There is no reason for Anet to "settle the dust" and "clear up" thing every time any people say something wrong or lie about their future plans. This leads to nothing. 
---
Just get your informations from serious sources (a fired ex-employee from long ago is *no* serious source) and don't listen too much to rumors, especially if they come from dubious/random/unknown/unserious people.
---
&gt; Spoilers being data-mined is caused by POOR data management or planning by Anet. Test builds should not be co-mingled with LIVE data.
---
Since we get no spoilers from data-miners, Anets data management and planning must be pretty good, no? ;)
---
Putting future stuff earlier into the game, to decrease the release update size, is a good thing, especially for the players on release day.
---
CHAOTIC INTERRUPTION IS GONE! \*Crab song intensifies\*
---
You say its broken but I brought 9 characters through it and done all non-migraine achievements, most separately, and only bugged once.
---
Once. Before their fixes. Out of ~25 playthroughs.
---
Makes me question if it truly is bugged.
---
That’s because I have better things to do than trying to convince salty ass players that the devs do the best they can to deliver us fresh content. Maybe if you all paced yourselves you wouldn’t blow through it all in 2 hours.
---
I gotta deal with this bullshit UI on stat selectable ascended gear.  This includes rings, accessories, amulets, and backpacks.  These are substantially easier to acquire than legendary gear.
---
They are both good, but different.
---
You need to touch all the checkpoints to be able to open the final chest
---
It looks more like frappe snowland
---
Current level is white.
---
Higher levels are yellow/orange/red depending on how far from current level.
---
Low levels are green/lime/gray. Again depending on distance from current level.
---
Since Malchor is 75-80 and Frostforge is 70-80 shows as white too, while Fireheart and Maelatrom at 70, they're gray.
---
That was painful to watch.
---
Merely a few days before the league ends loll
---
I feel like if that was a major reason, then there would be a great big "Are you sure??!?!?!?" confirmation window whenever you tried to deposit anything into the guild bank, regardless of your permissions
---
They should bring back that cost to repair gear so that people are more afraid to die
---
It is not just one port you must have touched all the checkpoints or you wont be able to open the chest and it wont count as if you have done it.
---
Maybe if you are lucky some Messmer who is good at jumping it can port you around but i would say that would be a big tip for the messmer because that is a lot of time involved.
---
Long live.. the king.
---
I’m guessing you don’t have them but would like them
---
If a large portion of a village is yacht owners it would be of valid concern. I’m guessing you don’t boat much

That's cool, I see people that look like Christmas ornaments all the time.

Do you have a list of everything that you'll need to craft [Twilight](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-30704)?
---
Sell everything else. While it is good to keep stuff in your bank, there's no need to have it just collecting dust in your bank.
---
Wouldn't know
---
As far as getting launched into space, the updrafts launch you when you step in them, wait until the apex of the launch and only deploy your glider as you start to fall again, or just go stand in the shield.

If you want the gloves, why not just buy them for cheap off the trading post?

You really should use staff on mirage. It's crazy strong with interrupts and stacks 25 on yourself and allies amongst other boons.

&gt; If GW2 is the most immersive MMO you have ever played, then you need to go out and play more MMOs.
---
I agree with OP and I've been playing mmos for about 15 years, I've lost count of how many in that time.  gw2 is still one of the most immersive games I've ever played.  Just because you don't agree with it, doesn't mean others haven't played other games.  People in this thread aren't even commenting on the things they said is immersive (the npcs, dialogue, music, sound effect).  They're just talking about particle effects and infusions, which I do agree need to be toned down but that doesn't take away from all the other great aspects of the game.
---
Three options:
---
1. Wait.
---
2. Datamine it yourself
---
3. Wade through threads on certain pedonazi-infested unmoderated internet forums for answers.

Expensive too... You want be able to make scribe-specific recipes for yourself? Better invest hundreds of gold in learning how because "decorating should be a communal effort". Bah, supplying yourself shouldn't be!

Just go farm Dragonfall for a couple days and you’ll be right as rain again.

I am totally on the side of dont trust anything she says post anet firing, partly because of the drama that caused the firing and mostly because of the BS disgruntled ex-employees can make up because they have an axe to grind. Has anything she said post-anet firing been accurate and something we as the community can look to and say "hey thats some damn good info right here and not misleading or inaccurate at all"
---
I remember the day Anet introduced the hiding of some locked mastery tracks, because people complained about being locked out of Spirit Shards from xp because of them. People complained for years, and were given the same exact response you're giving (suck it up, your fault anyway) by other players. However, Anet still changed it. 
---
Nothing backs your statements of it being "just as needless a request today as it was then", but we have precedent on our side.
---
Absolutely! You can look through a lot of the stuff she's posted and find good, interesting information. I can dig some stuff up if you like when I have time tomorrow.
---
Only because it's late and there is a bit of a step by step process. I'll quickly say (and I mean this super nice) a quick search for "fractals" will very likely bring up the other 30 or so topics asking the same thing you are to get the answers you need quicker.
---
Any loot?
---
Just use Taco and the Prototype Position Rewinder gizmo and do it yourself. The jumps aren't very hard and the PPR trivializes them anyway. The only hard part is figuring out where to go, and Taco does that for you.
---
It’s time-consuming, therefore it’s a challenge to ur patience. Duh.
---
This thing is the worse piece of crap I ever seen. It is bad as design, it is bad as User Interfere, it is bad as User Experience, it is bad as programming... It is bad on so many levels I can't understand how it is possible to exist. In my company the whole team will be fired if something like this is presented to a customer. I know our customers pay for software development and this is free update but still...
---
k.

Be’s a data miner, not a clairvoyant.
---
Having to scroll down that list too. Don't need to list the stat combos I already know the names of, but that might be okay for newer players, so an option would be nice.
---
I'm pretty sure he knows more than he shares tho Anet no doubt asked him to shush and stuff.
---
tits?...ass?...upside down nut sack?
---
yeah, disturbing...
---
SPOILERS AHEAD.
---
What really stuck out to me after years with all three campaigns was the henchmen. 
---
In Prophecies, you had some fairly fleshed out henchmen, but it didn't really change much. Aidan, Eve, Cynn, Mehnlo, and Devona all had their backstories and were easily identifiable, but for the the rest of them were just kind of...there. 
---
Nightfall was even worse. There was next to no interaction with the Henchmen outside of "hey, here's some dudes, they're there for the whole damn campaign. Have fun!!!!"
---
Cantha, though? Right as you make a character you're put into a tutorial zone that introduces all of the students that become henchmen. Then, as the story progressed and things became more dire, the instructors you learned from became your allies. And even then, the students weren't forgotten: you still interacted with them in Kaineng searching for clues. Lukas and Aeson even come back as henchmen in their respective factions!
---
Then, the split to Kurzicks and luxons. You meet almost all of the Kurzick henchmen and get to tag alone with Prophecies allies; you fight and interact with almost all of the Luxon henchmen. And then a whole slew of all of those people--Kurzick, Luxon, Canthan, Student--come together for the final assault. 
---
My point with all of that is that the henchmen in Factions were organic to the story and shifted around a whole bunch. You knew these people and got to fight alongside them. That's what made the story so damn rich for me as a single player.
---
Coral farming
---
Doing three dailies from the main daily category every day will give you 2 gold alone. So you should do that at least. A lot of people farm the Silverwastes, or the Dragonfall, as well. The HoT meta train gives you some decent loot. Plenty of ways to earn gold.
---
Something I've been eager to try for a while now, enjoy!  
---
  
---
Watch out Hizen \*eyes\*
---
I don’t know tbh, I ear people loving it, people hating it and if they fix the alphabetisation I’d like it myself
---
Most of the community is really fucking stupid and cope posts themselves into thinking GW2 has a WoW sized, infinitely replenishing, playerbase that will fill any void left by dissatisfied people
---
Yea yea when are we getting new classes? Seriously though some new dungeons would be nice, not some crappy new Fractal.
---
It's also becaus afaik the same UI is now use to pick stat for ascended items. So in this case it makes sense to ask if people are really sure. However the fact that this "Are you sure" was there for old ascended UI but not old Legendary UI makes me think they "forgot" to remove it for leg.

Hi guys I seriously need help with increasing my FPS on this game. I just updated my graphics card yet on average I get less than 20 FPS (during combat around 5-15 -\_-). When I stare at the wall I have great FPS (for me) which is around 25-35. I have no idea what else to do and I've constantly been messing with in-game settings as well as installing GW2 Hook to try and increase graphics on low settings. Here are my Specs:
---
Processor: Intel Core i7-3960X CPU @ 3.30GHz (12 CPUs)
---
Memory: 8192 MB RAM 
---
DirectX Version: DirectX 12
---
Graphics Card: Radeon RX 570   
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Any help would be extremely appreciated because I don't know what else I can do. I used to be able to run this game on fairly high settings when it first came out but now I can no longer do that. This game is basically unplayable with my current FPS and I'm not sure what else to do besides giving up lol.
---
Reddit in general is just full of kids. Kids tend to have weird misplaced aggression. When they see a thing that they don't 100% agree with, like it doesn't have to be a strong disagree, it just has to be something that doesn't 100% line up with their exact world view, they need to lash out at the person who said it. The only way to do that on reddit is by hitting a little useless down arrow next to their name which helps them feel like they've punished the bad person who made them feel that way. 
---
At least this is my theory, beyond that I cannot possibly comprehend why people downvote the most inane comments simply because that comment slightly varied from their own perspective on a topic.
---
Don't spend it
---
Silverwastes had very good rewards for the time and was one of the few areas where people had to work as a team to keep things going smoothly but not in a way where one group failing meant everyone would fail (looking at you early days of Auric Basin / Chak / Mord)  
---
(yes I know the golem part is sort of like that but it was no where near as bad as the chak or people fucking up on AB timing)
---
It also had staged content that felt different enough in each area to stay fresh.  
---
It also had 1.5 sets of armor and the first slotable aura so there was something to play for beyond the experience.  
---
Pretty much every other map that has ever been popular has just been because it was a good farm where you AFK between loot blitzes.
---
Was that with Jory dying? I thought they just decided on a better ending anyway, but they recorded lines for it
---
Exotic armor can be farmed in verdant
---
(Hot map) your right that it would be pricey but I don't really see viper having any use other then raiding, reason why the viper set will be delayed until there is a good multi reason to get it
---
Thx ^^
---
"Where's Daddy?" but the baby is the entire squad, and Daddy is linebacker Dhuum Jr.
---
Not at all, in fact I wasn't good at it yet either. But it seems every time I find something I enjoy, Mesmer-wise, ANet changes something that forces me to radically adjust my gameplay - again. Do I have to mention all the changes to the Boon Share Chrono that made us change our gear 12 times, before they finally made it impossible to share your boons? "Oh Mirages seem to use axes efficiency when done in a certain way, let's nerf it the axe". 
---
I know it was "broken" and I get the reasoning behind and adding an internal cool down seems to be the simple solution, but disabling an entire trait? I've never seen anything done so drastic before, and it seems to me that ANet really only want me to play Chrono or Mirage in a very rigid, streamlined way or else they'll change something. 
---
So to save me from more gear-changing, gameplay-adjusting trouble, I'll just delete the character. It feels like that's what ANet wants me to do.
---
I mean what truly immerses you in a game? It's not ambient sounds, it's actually just losing yourself in the game which happens when you're hyper focused on a task. The only times I become immersed in a game is when I actually just get so into whatever it is that I'm doing that I sort of space out of my real life for a short time. But, everyone's different. I get that some people aren't all that into gameplay in video games these days and they just wanna experience the atmosphere and environment of MMO's.
---
There only a couple of strong runes so these legendary runes are useless for people still gearing for legendary armor
---
True but consider that not saying anything would mean they would get absolutely wrecked by thousands of people submitting bug reports and demanding anet respond to the issue of an entire trait not working.  
---
Even they couldn't stay silent when making a change like this.
---
Yeah, it's pretty good on that type of immersion. Just not much roleplaying-style immersion
---
Shit... turning brain machine off
---
That’s the dumb
---
You must accept this is part of the legendary journey.
---
There is in custom arenas. It's very hard to balance around that and 5v5 at the same tkme, so there's basically only a single pair of specs that wins everything.
---
On the plus side, so much time will have passed you'll be used to it being kill and everyone will be happy for whatever dog doo replacement they give you to play with.
---
You are trying to stat change a piece of a very valuable equipment. Please type its name below to confirm the change.
---
Please double check your selection before confirming this *permanent* change.
---
Discard item.
---
A lot of people are secret weebs  
---
But seriously, it was just a gorgeous map with distinct areas that all had a unique feel to them that felt organic and unlike what you'd find in a typical mmo.  
---
\-Kaineng was a giant Hong Kong 'esc mega city where you walk around on roof tops, deep valley alleys, and sewers.  
---
\-Echovald was a petrified forest with gothic cathedrals carved out of the stone trees. The people were a weird mix of medieval gothic and kabuki theater getups.  
---
\-The Jade Sea was a petrified sea filled with sea monsters and Polynesian'esc people who traveled around on on the backs of giant turtles  
---
It also had great music by the same guy who made much of GW1 music and also made the Oblivion and Skyrim sound tracks.  
---
Story was kind of garbage and the voice acting was utter comedy tier bad but the rest was absolute gold.  
---
Also everyone was a weeb who wanted to make their Naruto ninja Assassin (downvote if you must but I was there)  
---
To be totally honest though, a lot of it is empty nostalgia from people who think that Anet can recapture that magic despite Mike O himself being one of the few people left with the company from that time.  
---
It wouldn't even be the same. The Forest and Sea have started to revert to normal and the Kurzicks and Luxons don;t exist as distinct peoples anymore.  
---
Frankly even the visual majesty of the city would be utterly fucked by anet shoveling in 5FPS zerg fights where you can't see what's going on due to all the skill and environment effects.
---
This is the most frustrating thing?
---
Are you sure?
---
Definitely, we should use it to get more content.
---
I don't get why they aren't in selectable groups, grouped by main stat.
---
Oh yeah, like the exit the game button does directly close the whole game, but we have to make sure you are not running plaguedoctor instead of marshal stats...
---
There's an entire Wiki that is, I am not exaggerating here, probably the single best example of a centralized gaming resource on the internet for a game of this size.  
---
Even wow doesn't have as streamlined a one stop shop and finding info for FF14 and ESO is a just whatever google can find for you.
---
Same here. Do you remember when the [wings were first released](https://i.imgur.com/aMmE6Md.png) in GW2? That was hilarious.
---
Permanent sounds too final to me sorry, exotic is permanent, ascended is flexable at a cost, legendary is the ultimate freedom
---
Humans will take the absolute least effort possible in anything. I don’t endorse anybody in overwatch because i can’t be bothered, and doesn’t benefit me in any way.
---
Do people not watch the Guild Chats? The writers confirmed it during a livestream about the S4E6 right after its release. They stated that it was not set in stone what would happen after S4. If it would be the end, if there would be an expansion or another LW season. They just didn't know and therefore have made the story end "properly" while still leaving some clues open if they did plan to continue after S4. The proper ending is a bit "meh" IMO but whatever, Aurene ascended and we got a beautiful cinematic at the end.
---
So to me this is the answer you seek. Yes, when planning S4, nothing was known about what came after. Is JP right about what she said? I won't be the judge to tell you that. But was she right about they didn't known what would happen after S4? Yes, she was.
---
Durability too.
---
yes
---
It is not really my first time. I have been a mesmer main for ages, and have played all game modes constantly and I just feel hopeless now with it. 
---
I have spent a lot on the game for gearing my main, extra bag slots and everything on my chrono, but every single time with changes I had to relearn stuff and regear again which hasn't been cheap. Now chrono is more or less deleted when it comes to wvw and pvp. In fractals boon support is not much needed now, and all this because people kept complaining it is too powerful and meta in raids, guess what, I like 80% of the community, from my guess, don't even do raids.
---
Now it seems mirage is still good as power shatter, and thanks to me playing power shatter chrono in wvw I know the rotations and am good at it so I guess I would switch to that. 
---
But all this is disappointing to say the least, I will not spend another cent on this game for gearing my mains as they keep butchering it, I am tired of this bullying and frankly have been thinking of giving up on this overall for a while.
---
Hes talking about statuettes, not chests, also they were available from statuettes years ago, thats why i mentioned them.
---
Get better informed please :)
---
Literally any game with other players will have them ruin your immersion one way or another.
---
Jup instead of putting it into off season pvp they just desided to not use it. I don't even care if balance is wonky.
---
Arenanet is an american company. Long term employees get replaced with new ones to save money. Its really nothing unusual. But tbh, some left on their own even before the layoffs and anet has a hard time replacing them, or before the layoffs didnt see any need to replace them.
---
Programmers dont make stuff for gemshop. And with no expansion on the horizon, Im sure anet thought they could get by without a server engine programmer - after all, the game is already "finished".
---
Sorry, no more UX people work at ArenaNet.
---
Even if there was he has some restraint and doesn't post obvious spoilers.
---
He has been known to tease things though, like posting a video in Orr before sirens landing etc.
---
Is that meta battle I see? Oh boy! Your inexperience with sPvP is showing.
---
Druid isn't even on that list and they still felt the need to nerf staff 3 but w/e  
---
Mesmers crying over not being the absolute peak of BiS is nothing new
---
If my other post didn't sway you, consider this.
---
Elixir s becomes less and less of an issue in the higher levels of play. You mention it's counterplay. Yes, there is counterplay. And holo gets even more screwed in ats. 
---
Because of this, I'd argue that good holo players should find less difficulty in handling an elixir s nerf, because it'd get counterplayed anyway. 
---
Like I said, I'm a holo main and I'd like for it to remain mostly the same.
---
The most complains about holo, I imagine, come from gold and silver players. Silver players don't complain as much though, however gold players do feel entitled enough to judge what is too strong or too weak.
---
For those players, that don't reveal on purpose and get surprised whenever a holo they target becomes tiny, holo just feels like such an obstacle to deal with, while also being a huge threat damage wise. 
---
The best thing to do here is adding obvious counterplay. 
---
Reaper does a LOT of damage, and you might hear some silvers complain, but generally in gold tactics become a thing and the general consensus is created that necros should be cced and bursted down asap.
---
Nerfing elixir s would relieve a big obstacle for gold players. They'd find that targetting the holo and bursting it down actually works fairly well, and thus the consensus is created that while holo deals a lot of damage, it can be dealt with pretty well.
---
This already true for reaper, deadeye, sic em soulbeast, beserker and to a lesser extent scourge and guardian. 
---
You only need to create a feeling of power in the people fighting against the holos.
---
Right now theyre just frustrated that even when they try to adress the damage, they just get met with a tiny engi that flees in stealth, resustains and comes back with huge burst again.
---
Make them be able to deal with the threat quickly, while keeping what makes holo good to play at higher ranks.
---
It's pretty dated and poorly optimized. It's a nice slideshow I guess.
---
Warclaw should have been guardian movement speed trait.
---
This is ridiculous on so many levels. First the build has been around more or less since the Scepter buffs, but noone used it because there were better builds available. Now that basically all mirage builds are nerfed to ground instead of trying to assess the underlying issues with class mechanics and PvP in general, people found the next best build, which in turn now has been smiters booned. This is plain ridiculous, basically there is no way to play mesmer in pvp now.
---
Not to mention CI IS NOT THE PROBLEM, the trait was one of the very few traits that actually rewarded skillful gameplay if NOT combined with Infinite Horizon.
---
I was playing core interrupt mesmer for 2 seasons with pretty great succcess before this sh\*t came to meta and everyone started running the mirage variant, which is a very dumb and no-skill build especially compared to the original core version. But CI is NOT the problem itself..
---
Mate, I've been playing nothing BUT WvW for the entire first year. But telling them that they killed their own gamemode is like expecting people to take responsibility for their own actions. Never going to happen. It's always everyone elses fault.
---
And calling people lazy because they don't invest as much in a computer game as you will never stop being a sad sight.
---
Let's keep it at that.
---
press "h" and click on "summery". then scroll down and on the right side is a little bar with a percentage number.

Agree and I see more and more people getting sick of crafting in mmorpgs.

playing every day ≠ playing casually. If you play every day you're way out of casual league

What are you even expecting from a healer in pvp? Also its a spec, ranger is in the great tier list.

Every day you play

Fashion power creep 😹😹
---
There are certainly limits... the majority of what he does is decoding the gw2.dat file and look at what's in there. He's a data miner... not a god.
---
Most of that file is text. F.e. It contains names of all items and their chat links that are currently patched into the game. That's how he can f.e. get the new gemstore items a couple weeks in advance because those get patched in bulk and then unlocked on the store over the coming weeks. That is also where he derives the [countdown](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/countdown/) from.
---
Other than that a lot of the .dat file are graphics. Images, videos, textures, map art etc as well as sound data like spoken voicelines, SFX, creature sounds and of course music. One can certainly glean some infos from those but most of it is pretty cryptic. Shaman mostly looks at deprecated data that is used nowhere in the game or where data changes from patch to patch.
---
If you think Shaman knows much more about Season 5 than we do at this point you are most likely mistaken. While many of his findings are certainly fascinating, he doesn't have *more* data per se than we have. He just has a better magnifying glass than most of us to read it.
---
Now for if he knows more than he posts publicly I'm almost sure of it. For one most of the data you see when mining is pretty boring generic stuff or someting that is available in game so there's not much to mine out. On the other hand I found Shaman to be a very sensible and diligent person who while providing interesting or even important information doesn't want to ruin the fun for others by spoiling upcoming content.
---
If he **actually knows** where we're heading (which I very much doubt) he's more likely keeping it a secret on his own volition rather than on ANets behalf.
---
The loot box mentality needs to be reduced drastically. I agree, the mount loot boxes suck ass!
---
&gt; and ask us mods to remove his posts
---
And you are the slaves of ArenaNet? This is an independent site, they can't control what does and does not get posted.
---
&gt; pedonazi-infested unmoderated internet forums 
---
Link?
---
the only game doing it very well is FFXIV imho, the crafting has some additional depth and can be actually used to make money.
---
*if they're not too busy with other tickets*
---
Now imagine being in a WvW guild and being asked to scribe them 100 of each piece of siege... whelp, looks like I'm gonna be sitting here forever. Scribing really needs to ditch the timers or seriously nerf them.
---
You can actually solo champions with that build.
---
Peak GW2 is long gone.
---
I feel like a lot of people who want a luck sink, probably also bought their luck.
---
It's About as much a glorified platformer as Zelda games are
---
&gt; because that is how much you are getting while playing casually (minimum)
---
I think you underestimate what casual players do in this game.
---
Some probably log in, buy a few gemstore skins, chat in guild chat and decorate the guild hall - Nothing earned.

Tried checking your material storage? Chances are if you have never had over 10g, You have never cleared it out or sold materials you don't need.
---
Inb4 250 mystic coins.
---
Eh, I always do it.
---
If I don't they just get fully stacked and I cant deposit anymore.
---
I say go for it if you don't need them.
---
Especially an ex-employee fired under not too pleasant circumstances, who then went on to trash-talk the company in any way she could.
---
She was fired over a year ago. If they started working on plans for s5 within a month oir so after her departure, then both statements make total sense
---
HEr ranting aside, she did offer some interesting looks into episode 6 after that came out.
---
Id, then salvage and sell or craft. You still have a chance to discover rares when you id your greens.
---
She was fired over a year ago. If they started working on plans for s5 within a month or so after her departure, then both statements make total sense
---
The Atlantic sea?
---
grazie!
---
Don't worry. ANet will nerf it during next balance patch, I'm sure. My bet is something like "shatters became too powerful, so we've removed them until we figure out how to fix them".
---
Is fashion really that immersion breaking though?  I do get that some people take it to an extreme and they do end up standing out a lot like say the person who posted the golden outfit character in lions arch. However even those extremes are they really immersion breaking?  What I am saying is you do expect to see some people standing out, happens in real life too. Like if you were to meet someone who has a large number of piercings (talking about record holding people with like close to 500 piercings here) or someone who is into extreme body modification. Doesn't even have to be extreme, some people do elaborate hairstyles too like say decorate their hair like a Christmas tree for Christmas or shape it into long twisted horns for Halloween. Doesnt have to be anything out of the ordinary either, sometimes you walk down the street and see people in costumes.. dressed like some chicken cartoon etc.. Does your immersion break because they dont hold to the more conventional everyday fashion of other people? No of course not... how could it, its real life you cant immersion break reality so how is it any different in a virtual world? and yes obviously you can take it a bigger extreme with unnatural glows and such like the example that was posted but again even then this is a world of magic, if magic existed in the real life and people could become glowy wouldn't they? We dont even have to imagine cause even without magic people already try to make themselves glow in various ways, just google glow fashion to find some examples. 
---
Like OP said devs pour tons of love into the game to make it incredibly immersive, not just amazing sounds but that sounds like say the wood creaking of say a turning windmill will also randomize itself so it doesnt have a discernible repeating pattern and thats not limited to sounds, even when building environments, Anet didnt copy and paste the same objects to save time, lots of things are uniquly modeled, like say lets take the same golden glowy character picture posted below, the bank octopus structure has tons of scratches on the walls but each scratch is unique when most games would use the same scratch texture multiple times. Even ambient creates, they have multiple idle animations. Thats all stuff that takes a ton of work but the result is a rich immersive world. And lets not forget the dynamic event systems. NPCs that dont just stand there all day but that run around, doing various chores, the world feels alive to a degree no other MMO I have ever played comes even close. I dont feel all that comes crashing down just because you see someone standing out from the "norm".

Its been "tested" and known to have less than 1000hp, but I'm not sure if anyone knows the exact number. I would guess somewhere in the middle, around 500hp.
---
Yes, its that bad. Its a joke to compare it to minions rehargless of class.
---
New ANet development strategy - rush patches, don't test *shit*, just disable stuff community rants about or makes duping possible, for indefinite amount of time. The Bethesda Way.
---
GW2 minions are more convenient, GW1 ones are more realistic. GW1 minions' constant health depletion is the main reason I don't run a mm necro there.
---
All I get from that article is that Lineage remastered was a hit.
---
Maybe they should make an attempt at remastering the original Guild Wars and lower the price of the game hoping for an influx of players there? Guild wars was and still is a very good game, that just needs a fresh coat of paint to shine again.
---
From the creators of Bagception... Recipeception.

He probably has seen something that could be an easy tell but I think that the fact that he keeps that stuff secret (he has done it several times) is something good. That shaman is best shaman.
---
Character slots to get at least 1 of every class, 1 shared inventory slot (if you don't have it already), and any salvage-o-matic to put in that slot. That's it.
---
This was awesome man! Congrats on the solo kill :)
---
&gt; ... did anyone test this?
---
Last couple of patches in one sentence.
---
Season 1 in a nutshell.
---
Not for me it hasn’t, nor for the rest of my raid group. None of us has been able to have build templates work with legendary components.
---
It's a bit funny how I talk about world design and everyone else talks about fashion.  
---
To add a bit to your post, fashion monstrosities are quite rare in the open world. You mostly meet them at the lounges and racial cities. So they aren't actually that immersion breaking. Not that they make the world design itself any less immersive.
---
The problem is what used to be ways to make money and get cool items have just been turned into money sinks.
---
So that is why I’m broke.
---
IIRC you can get trinkets in any stat! That you can reset the stats of. The legendary fractal backpack should require some fractal currency in earlier steps. Honestly, just check the wiki pages for both currencies.
---
It’s not hard if it can be done by 8manning.
---
It is harder than the rest of the pve content by a lot but that’s only because the general difficulty in this game is next to zero.
---
You are replying to a deleted account lol
---
thats very wishful thinking and unrealistic
---
housing would be strictly for material sink, gold sink etc. it would be tied to crafting exclusively, maybe few rewards would be obtainable like in raids.
---
&gt;Or you can just give up on dealing with scribing bs and buy Effervescent Pod from Dragonfall for a cheap price. Life is simpler nowaday.
---
Honestly that aquisition method is the way to go forward with new decorations.
---
yeah i dont mind crafting a lot, but streamlining it so it's not a "labyrinth" of crafts to get 1 single craft you need. i'd rather they make simple recipes that break down what you need. so for example if currently i need to craft 4 chairs to make 1 big chair, in the reworked recipe just tell me to use mats that 4 chairs would use instead of crafting those 4 chairs.
---
&gt; They can't prevent his leaks
---
Of course they can. They simply don't put anything in the updates except for the things being released on that specific day. Which means more to update for everyone during releases.
---
Why the larger PSU for a single-CPU/single-GPU system? The previous 550W option is pretty much the perfect choice for running this system at highest efficiency.
---
I actually like scribing. I prefer it to the other crafting disciplines.
---
Yeah, it's quicker to be able to throw some blood on some cloth and leather, then toss that with two halves of an article of clothing and you're done. But it's so dull.
---
Scribing has you make almost everything from scratch or buy a skeleton of the thing from a vendor and build on that. You make your own pens and paper and everything. The process shows a lot more of the steps that actually go into crafting something, and I like that a lot.
---
It still pales in comparison to actual crafting systems, like what FFXIV has, where each discipline is its own complete *class* and you use several abilities as well as materials to craft items. But scribing is still a fun side thing.
---
ITT: OP finds out this subreddit is not his personal echo chamber.

Compare some [WoW skins](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/74091-skyshatter-regalia-rewm-aegis-of-fire-burning-blade-us.jpg) to those released [in GW1](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/1/1f/Ranger_Norn_armor_m.jpg) during the same year. This is the contrast of particle effect vs elegant down to earth design I'm talking about.
---
took way too long, you could play a bit more offensively
---
Go take the tour around the city.
---
Doesn't really mean much after Lion's Arch has been destroyed... what is it...? Like 4-5 times now? Maybe more?
---
we are reaching the point where devs take a look at forum to get inspiration for trash talk
---
Yeah, I've been thinking about this for a while, a pass that takes us to old LA. I'd buy it in an instant. The Mists already explains most things that doesn't make sense
---
&gt;But changing build, gear, etc every 3 months because someone wants me to play a class in a certain way is sort of exhausting.
---
It seems that almost all your complaints above are related to PvE changes to mesmer.
---
but they are only disabling this trait in PvP, in this game mode, changing gear is pretty trivial and quite common.
---
Moreover, despite all the nerfs, it remains one of the most used class of the game. And unlike any other, it remained consistant since launch with the old 4 war 1 mesmer meta.
---
Yeah meta ends when the timer runs off and the wall breaks. Maybe that’s why you didn’t receive the item for the collection yet 🤔
---
It's scripted dialogue that you eventually hear 100 times.
---
Dulfys site was never the best for news. The only thing it was good for was the guides that she used to post back when she was still a partner and was able to play new episodes before everyone else can.
---
Yes.
---
The system is absolute trash to interact with but I will give the designer some props for actually thinking out what they did:  
---
Scribes write stuff, it's what they do.  To write things you need pens, ink and paper (and magical dust just cause).  
---
What is ink made of?  Basically something to stain another object with, in this case something to color water.  
---
What is paper made of?  Wood that has literally been ground to a pulp, and in the old days of parchment, sometimes pressed with cloth backing? (Not gonna delve into the history of paper for a reddit post)  
---
What is a pen made of?  Shaft (dowel works), nib (metal).  
---
ETC.  
---
Whoever made the recipe hierarchy took every single thing and fleshed it all out ad nauseum.  I can appreciate the RP thought process that went into this but obviously there are a number of problems here.  
---
Nested recipes for any single decoration:  Blueprint needs (1): Finishing kit needs (2): Scribing Kit needs (3): Pen needs (4): Nib needs (5): Ingots needs (6): Ore.  
---
To be clear, this is just one path through the recipe hierarchy to make a required component of almost every decoration the scribe crafts.  SIX levels of shit that have to be crafted for ONE PART of one part of one part etc. of the final product.  The crafting system simply isn't made for dealing with that level of whatever the word is for this, and there are only two ways to fix this aspect of it:  
---
1) Rewrite all of scribe and make fast and happy with the material refunds (and eat PR shit for all the already created decorations) for every recipe that has to be removed.  
---
2) Rewrite the crafting interface.  
---
Give all crafting interfaces the ability to automatically craft any sub-components needed to make the recipe the user is looking at.  
---
Make the recipe being viewed show all required materials, including those of all sub components and their sub components, and highlight any the user is missing.  
---
This way all the various components can continue to exist, but nobody is forced to deal with the frequently extreme nesting of recipes.  
---
This can also be done in a programatically simple way, allbeit ugly, since every recipe already individually checks if the materials needed are present and has a trigger button to begin the crafting (Basically jury-rig an auto-clicker type of system onto the UI with a couple extra checks).  
---
That's just the crafting interface... There are also problems with the recipes themselves.  
---
1) Material costs.  If my scribe is writing documents with a pen the size of a fucking spear, I not only want to watch that process, I want that spear-sized pen as a usable item skin. (3 metal ingots &amp;&amp; 3 wood planks for a nib, the same as swords, greatswords, hammers, spears etc).  Just one example, no shortage of others too.  
---
There is another material cost issue when expensive recipes require some crazy rare item, like Giant Mushroom Spores, and then every iteration of the decoration line needs one (or needs 2 because you need 2 squat thorny mushrooms to make 1 tall one for some reason).  These need to be adjusted/rethought and the rarity of the rare material should also likely be looked at.
---
2) Plants... Potted plants especially omfg.  Wtf with the pots?  First, I find the pots fugly.  Second THERE IS A BASIC PLANTER DECORATION AT THE DECORATION VENDER so why in the hell do I need to craft a ceramic pot?  Then why do I need to craft a ceramic pot EVERY FUCKING ITERATION?!  Also why can't I have the plant without the pot?  
---
There is no easy solution for this one, it just has to be redone.  
---
3) Decoration size versus cost/headache.  
---
When I need more than 1g worth of mats to make a fucking shrub (hedge) that is barely as tall and not even wide as an asura, somebody fucked up.  
---
This is one of those places were material cost, complexity and how many precursor decorations going into the current one absolutely need to increase the size or other fancyness of the end result by A LOT.  There was one plant that required like 50g worth of rare seeds for something similarly disappointing to the hedge.  All the recipes should probably be checked to make certain the end result matches the cost/complexity and either new ones be made to replace the ones that dont add up, or existing decorations are going to end up getting fucked with.  One of those bad design decisions that has no good answer but MUST BE ANSWERED to make it suck less in the future.  
---
4) Decoration color schemes.  This one is a sore point for me.  I love my trees, especially my ascalon trees... But in game there exist green and even pink ones, why can't I make/place those?  
---
5) Decoration model variations.  
---
Why can't I have the leaves section of the Ascalon tree without the trunk as a bush?  Larger/smaller versions of existing decorations?  Longer wall sections, etc.  We need these.  
---
6) Z-axis tilting.  
---
Guild hall instances are neither flat nor symmetrical.  The decoration placement system was built in a way that appears to assume both.  Either the halls need a massive redoing, or the decoration system needs to have a way to tilt the decorations added.  
---
So many more things.  
---
**TLDR:**  
---
We got a system that is in a "early working state" iteration and needs massive refinements.  It "works" in that it isn't outright broken, but it needs a whole lot of polish.
---
That's cool, he doesn't see them much.
---
Gonna have to back this poster.  
---
FFXIV's immersion is much more powerful.
---
&gt;  a big, hostile, open world that tells you to figure things out for yourself 
---
...Well, yeah, I guess when you put it that way, this is a pretty close representation of real life.  
---
Too real, man.
---
I'm imagining trying to do scribing in the old crafting system when they didn't nest windows. They basically redesigned their system just for scribing, and boy was that needed.
---
ITT people thinking the term "weeb" has anything to do with Chinese, Gothic, and Greek Nomadic cultures. The absolute state of social media where words mean nothing and people just throw shit around.
---
God no. Can you even imagine bugs this would introduce and the time they'd need to fix them? 
---
You can now double-click to put items into and take out from guild storage, but scrolling doesn't work, chat is upside-down and every step you take has a 3.14% chance to reset your inventory.
---
This game has one of the least 'keeping easily accessible information on the game up to date' scenes I have ever seen in any currently-alive-and-popular MMO.  
---
It's kinda hilarious.
---
That's a really smart and elegant solution.
---
Which is why Anet will never think to implement it.
---
Wow. Ty for this response...
---
You can still take items out, and deposit/withdraw gold.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Royal_Chak_Ichor
---
Yo bro. Im new too. Just play t1 until ~15 then get ascended trinket and rings from vendors and try to put +5 ag res on them. Then you slowly have to get ascended armor and there im absolutely lost. Help anyone? Where? When? How?
---
Do you mind showing us your kill time?
---
no
---
what mechanic isn't offloaded to chronos and healer? they do the kiting, tanking(in pugs at least) and along with bs the greens
---
pay attention to what? maybe greater mark timing can catch you in a bad spot while simultaneously lacking condi cleanse and being low and then somehow nobody able to revive you either? the rest of the "mechanics" have big words on the screen that are impossible to miss
---
You want to make gold?    
---
     
---
If yes, then convert them into regular relics and buy stacks of fractal encryptions when they are near or below 20s. Then open 30 of them everyday. You will make profit.     
---
There were only a few days when I actually lost gold (1-2g max). Most days I got anywhere from breakeven to 13-15g, but the average was around 2-5g. I only counted mostly liquid gold trash so actual profit was more. I also have max MF (didn't bother with boosters besides Bday) so you may get differnt results. Oh and if you get Ascended Recipe, pick OSSA i think, its the only one that's sellable on TP.    
---
       
---
Now I'm all out of relics and haven't done fractals in years....
---
Oh this Jessica shit again?
---
Holo wasn't nerfed in PvP unless you were bad at the game. Also, there is a difference between ranked and AT balance remember sic em soulbeast?
---
"Reddit is retarded" fucking grow up a bit LUL
---
The karka tried, but that was a shit show of lag that stopped them.
---
Post "New to Fractals! I'm trying them out. All accepted."
---
If you're like me it's probably best to just dive into T1 and do 'research' if you have any questions later.
---
The worst crafting system in the game tis what.
---
Ah, thanks for the info.
---
Thanks!
---
Once was enough.
---
I got my Infinite Omnipotion by converting Pristine Relics to regular Relics. It's definitely worth it if you do fractals a lot.
---
Can we nuke La again and have a player mat dump event to rebuilt it? Maybe put out some current events relevant to it as well while we are rebuilding it.
---
Give it the old style and just put an asura made force field around the city.
---
The HP train zergs take 2 to 2.5 hours by themselves and *still* don't actually complete any of the maps for you. You just get the hero points, and a handful of PoIs that you happen to hit along the way.
---
Who would win? One pathetic mortal or the Fractal God of all that is Robotic? 
---
oh, guess the mortal isn't so pathetic.
---
Seriously, that is incredible! I knew in theory the encounter could be soloed, but without losing the singularity? One of the best PvE fights I've ever watched.
---
You put the unlimited gathering tools into the shared tools and you put normal gathering tools on your character. Then you just double click each unlimited gathering tool in the shared slots and it will automatically swap them, and then you can harvest limitless. When you're done playing that char, again double click harvsting tools in shared slots and it will swap them back. Then switch to another char.
---
 Rinse and repeat.
---
In response to your edit:  
---
Retribution was almost a need due to the survivability it brings, at least for me since this was only my 2nd ever 'session' going up against this solo (not to be confused with attempts haha, this took hours of failed attempts for me :p)  
---
The key skills though:  
---
\&gt; [Enduring Recovery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Enduring_Recovery) \- More Dodges  
---
\&gt; [Planar Protection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Planar_Protection) \- Dome from Heal skill was mainly used for the Red Orbs from Auto attacks, as well as the bouncing Red Orbs from Enrage Phase as it absorbs the orbs and stops the bouncing. [(Example of absorbing bouncing orbs)](https://youtu.be/7HBYD4mKfOw?t=1016)  
---
\&gt; [Steadfast Rejuvination](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Steadfast_Rejuvenation) \- The regen from energy upkeep here was very strong and allowed me to survive some very tight situations, this + impossible odds is a very good disengage while regenerating health simultaneously.
---
I don't get it...
---
Ah, I love mist magic (radiation?). It makes people so glowy! (that's pretty much what infusions are :P)
---
\*cough\* \*cough\* Curse you, Scarlet.
---
Harrier is a good usual default stat. Magi is decent for healing builds that don't need BD. Then Minstrels is good if you want to tank/WvW(only do this if you know what you're doing).
---
End up being 2000 gems.
---
Someone solo'd it without being hit aswell :)
---
&gt;while we Mr Torque our way to victory.  
---
I love this statement \^^
---
This dialogue has been in since New LA was added, so four years ago. It's existed longer than the old LA did
---
If you did a raid and you were just spamming stuff, you were getting hard carried by your raidmates.
---
In Open World most people just use whatever they feel like, but to actually contribute and pull your own weight in high level fractals and raids, you can't do that. There are reasons why the rotations are the way they are, and not doing those rotations (or trying, at least) makes an enormous difference in your damage and (if it applies to your chosen class) boon output. 
---
If you think just mashing whatever comes off CD is how you get the most out of your class, then it sounds like it's not GW2 that's the problem; sounds more like you don't really understand how to play at a high level of skill.
---
I'm no pathetic mortal?? Well shucks!!  
---
I really appreciate the watch, it was a fun encounter to learn for sure!  
---
The first video I saw was actually of [Deroir on Condi Revenant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS0C3MlSiOY) a few years ago, I thought it was so sick, and it's just been in the back of my mind ever since.
---
The ones i cant decide between are ventari or theodosus (at least in German it's theodosus)
---
Even if you don't destroy your mouse in the process, it still takes too long.
---
I think he just means that dailies don't often double-dip.  JP's tend to count as events toward completer dailies these days.
---
I feel like healing through damage on ele would be reeeeally strong especially given the synergy it would have with signet of water
---
I'm fairly certain that it was more than that.  I'm counting the ruins in the harbor too.
---
And 5 bucks says that if they didnt put that confirmation then there would have been countless complaints about accidentally selecting the wrong stat without a confirmation to double check that you have the right choice made.
---
&gt; most immersive MMO
---
lol
---
what does this have to do with me? you can see on youtube many sub 10min mama solos
---
Youtube show where this guy pitches movies to an executive who is the same guy. Really funny. The channel is Screen Rants I think.
---
Probably, sure. I wouldnt doubt it.
---
As well as music, story, encounter design, difficulty curve, unique game mechanics, and a clear long term plan that doesn’t make its community worry the game will disappear in a couple years.
---
Well,... older 3D Zelda games did have some platforming. Ocarina of Time was notorious for having thin planks to walk on and jumping from platform to platform was common.
---
Yes, they're amazing and I say it as someone who was a poor polish person earning the minimum wage while buying them.
---
On the other hand, I don't play gw2 anymore because I just have no idea what's going on.
---
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8tzgFmPB1o
---
Work on getting fractal God if you don't have it already. I've had it for a year and my problem now is that I have over 3k pristines without anything to spend it on other than maybe gear (which I don't need)
---
Or leaping to their doom in an attempt to make into the well to get to the chest at the end of that jumping puzzle.
---
Own Path of Fire
---
1) normal way: use level 80 character to do the prologue of PoF
---
2) alternate way: even if you're at low level you can join someone who is level 80 and let them carry you through the aforementioned prologue
---
Level 80 in the Path of Fire expansion.
---
You'll get Raptor, Springer, Skimmer and Jackal as you progress through the story.
---
The Griffon is a "hidden" mount that requires some gathering plus 250G.
---
The Roller Beetle can be started on in Season 4, Episode 3 IIRC. It requires some gathering.
---
The Skyscale can be started on in Season 4, Episode 6 and requires a lot of gathering plus around 150-200G depending on how much stuff you have for the collection already.
---
80.
---
You get your first mount when completing the first chapter of Path of Fire (the second expansion). 
---
Or buy spending quite some time in World vs World in order to unlock the Warclaw (Still requires Path of Fire).
---
You need the Path of Fire expansion for mounts, but you'll unlock the first one after completing the first story mission from that expansion. It's a level 80 mission but once you unlock a mount on one character, it will be available to all your characters, even low-level ones.
---
Mounts require path of fire. After that just play the first chapter of the story (lv80 character required but you should get an lv80 booster with path of fire.) and you get the raptor. After that continuing path of fire story will unlock addional mounts.
---
Prob, unless its made by Taimi, then it will deus ex machina all our problems away :p
---
Look, I do get that predatory practices exist, and that some things do cross the line.
---
But... there also has to be some personal accountability here. The beauty of GW2 is that you don't *have* to buy anything. You can if you want to, but if *you* make the choice to buy something you can't afford (especially if you do it repeatedly), it's childish and toxic to blame that on the place that sold you the item. Everybody praises FF for some ridiculous reason, but I tried it out and decided that it's not worth it because I can't afford to maintain a monthly subscription. That's the same reason I quit WoW originally -- it was no longer worth the monthly cost. Meanwhile, I can play GW2 whenever I want, at no cost, and I don't have to invest any money at all unless I choose to -- and I only choose to when I know I can afford it, because I try to be a responsible adult. Sure, expansions are *almost* a must-have if you play the game seriously, but there's nothing forcing you to buy it immediately other than FOMO, which you have to resist if you're going to survive financially in this world. I bought both expansions a little late, because I had to make choices about what I could afford.
---
I agree that loot box mechanics are predatory in the way of slot machines (I feel the same way about the RL lottery that prays on the desperate hopes and dreams of poor people), but you're talking about being unable to resist an item in the shop *just because it exists*. Literally a normal item. We all know that "limited availability" means nothing in this game, because they always bring these items back eventually (and sometimes on sale). If you can't resist buying something just because it's *there*, and you want to blame the business for making it avialable, how is *any* business supposed to sell *anything* responsibly ever?
---
For that matter, why are video games held to a different standard than literally every other storefront? Stores put things on sale, after all. If you can't actually afford to buy something that's on sale at Walmart, but you buy it anyway because the very fact that it's on sale for a limited time made it irresistable to you, does that mean we should shut down Walmart? 
---
Don't get me wrong, I despise Walmart, but "existing and selling items" is not one of the issues I have with them -- and by your description, this would be an issue for you. How do you function?
---
That would be cleric stats for theodosus.
---
Are you playing core guard or firebrand?
---
Wenn es um WvW geht suchst du Minstrel/Minnesängerisch/Maklain (Zähigkeit/Heilkraft/Konzentration/Vitalität), für Raids empfielt es sich dagegen Harrier/Verheerend/Zehtuka zu nehmen, da du als Wächter viele Segen verteilst und daher Segensdauer brauchst (bzw haben solltest), aber dort Zähigkeit zu vermeiden ist, damit dir die Tanks nicht an die Gurgel gehen. Alternativ müsstest du dann selbst tanken.
---
Für Fraktale ebenfalls Harrier/Verheerend.

Oh sweet, each one comes with a free potential commander/catmander tag.
---
You can own 90% of the mats that will make it almost free but it's not cheap aye
---
That is because she designed a better version of LA and instead they used the gaudy shit sea world LA instead of her design.
---
I would like to see "Fractal Rifts"·
---
Remember the starting instances, HoT prologue and the [Mists Rifts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mists_Rift)?  
---
They are examples of shared instances that allow multiple players. Starting instances and hot prologue also happen in the same map as an explorable area, while you are inside them, they have the red warning border in the map indicating it's an instance, and they also have the older 'rules' in those maps, without mounts for HoT prologue, and without mounts and gliding. 
---
Fractal rifts would use a combination of their characteristics.
---
* You walk to the Fractal Rift in a certain map. 
---
* You use it and enter a an old version of the map, either the whole map if the whole map changed, or a cutout with the red map border warnings if only parts of the map changed.
---
* This would allow revisiting:
---
 * Old LA.
---
 * LA during the karka attacks.
---
 * LA during the evacuation.
---
 * LA during Scarlet's attack.
---
 * LA during the aftermath of Scarlet's invasion.
---
 * Kessex Hills before the Nightmare Tower.
---
 * Kessex Hills during the Nightmare Tower.
---
 * The Twisted Marionete in False River Valley.
---
* Since they are instanced, they can have different map rules to open world maps, and so if there'a any problem with gliding or mounts in them, they can be just simply disabled. That'll allow making things like replaying the Twisted Marionette without having to worry about reworking the map with gliding and mounts in mind.  
---
Having Fractal rifts would also allow making future changes to maps without losing what gets replaced or removed.
---

---
Why even make this post? People have always stopped playing games. They either come back or they do something else they enjoy. Doesn't matter if players are dropping, we have 0 means of estimating whether this drop is even significant or not. The shit stirred up by the community over the past weeks certainly hurt the game as a whole, but it's not going to die in the next 6 years if I had to guess.
---
All the nested recipes have to go.
---
Post-haste.
---
People are leaving yes it happens in every MMO I dare think people are moving from Final Fantasy to GW2 or ESO to WoW or WoW to GW2. But people are acting like its when a large influx of Bless players moved to GW2 when that pile of shit failed. GW2 is a casual game so people can leave for months on end and come back for updates some may have left for good but many will probably return when season 5 starts and then leave again till the next living world, raid, or major update is released.
---
And now?
---
Just self aware.
---
So? Time moves on. I quit FFXIV years ago then started playing this for four years, so what?
---
Ideas are like cream...good ones rise to the top.
---
Wow, welcome back, Rheyo! You're the guy who got me into high level fractals with your guide videos :)
---
I kinda liked the old traps for PvE, you didn't have to trigger them manually x)
---
I read a while ago that apostrophes after abbreviations used to be [the right way](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/55970/plurals-of-acronyms-letters-numbers-use-an-apostrophe-or-not) to go, but times changed, and they no longer are. However, out of habit, older people still use apostrophes, along with younger illiterate morons.
---
Snow Crows, Deroir, let's not forget Tekkit the god of TacO
---
I much prefer old LA and barely spend any time in the new one.
---
Wow, for some reason i thought we had it years and years. Goes to show how long we've held onto that idea of LA. It's probably that i've spent the most of this LA in the pass areas like queens terrace. I like to avoid the new LA, its just not cosy enough. One thing i miss the most is Halloween in the old one, it had such a good vibe.
---
heck yes! That is so awesome, congrats!!
---
What do you mean? I used the classic google form and shortened the link.
---
The gameworld doesn't need MORE fracturing...
---
Pretty sure your friend refers to your playstyle for Thief, because P/P lacks damage and cleave compared to e.g. Staff Daredevil build of Thief, which does pretty good damage. P/P is fine for Open World, but you should def. use a different build for Fractals, Raids and so on.
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/daredevil/power/
---
https://discretize.eu/builds/thief/power-daredevil
---
Its pretty stupid that we don't have something like:
---
healing-boon duration-vitality
---
Which actually would be great for most healers.  You will find that this entire game is literally balanced around the fact that you can't get optimal gear sets for the task you want to do.  Another example, condi builds waste a ton of stats on power, because they have no choice.  Additionally for a long time builds that didn't tank or heal, but still gave boons were really screwed, and forced to take toughness. 
---
Anet left the game in this state for years.  Don't expect it to change, its very dumb.
---
Imo it would have to be a full new elite spec were it is about support and dps is not really what you go for. The damage would have to be tuned downs and be about hps rather then dps. Chloro was never a dps soul it was a heal soul but to heal you had to do damage. Imo the best healer class any game ever had. 
---
The hybrid builds were great with Chloro and that is why i feel it would suit with ele because you can really make hybrid builds with ele due to the focus it have. Let's say you can add a buff or what ever that lessen the damage but add support to each hit you make in varieties ofc, men i can go on about it i have had this in my head for years but you get the picture :D
---
If you never pass 10g per day then it’s more a spending behavior problem than earning. Could you clarify to yourself and others what you’re spending on? Perhaps a little 30g skin here and there? 
---
Daily 2G (20min), fractals daily 20g, (60min), playing anything like meta events amalgamated 5g (30min)
---
Let’s say those are basic rough generous underestimated figures. You can earn 30g per day for a very fast time without even rushing or trying hard and just casually playing. In one month you can 1000g! Think about it xD
---
The gw2 forums have a new and returned gem sale thread stickied in the general subforum. That has the sales a few days in advance and when they're ending.
---
The gold rewards through tp of dragon bash were just insane
---
And you might want a specific skin so you have to do that at that time.
---
Also the ap rewards even yearly are just op..
---
The rewards are not balanced around notmal play and if constant festivals are a thing it makes normal play less rewarding as the festival rewards overshadow it.
---
I just dont like timed content. I disliked it in every mmo. But that might be me.
---
Let's be honest, you'd play against so many Firebrand/Scourge duos that it would be miserable.
---
You won't
---
Yes, my PhD supervisor made me add apostrophes all over the place and I was confused until I looked it up. Question is, do I sneak the apostrophes back out..?
---
Better than Berserker and Renegade who haven't had viable metabattle builds for several months.
---
Yes everyone agrees warrior needs a nerf. Chaos Storm **does** daze you for 5 seconds because it lasts 5 seconds and dazes you every second. If you try to cast any skills during that time, you'll get interrupted and then CI kicks in and immobilizes you. The whole point of that combo is to make you waste defensive cooldowns and dodges so the mirage can pull off phantasms and lots of ambush skills on you. Warrior is very strong but can't escape Chaos Storm outside of Rampage because if you try to cast a skill with a long precast time like greatsword 3 or  5, you'll get dazed in the middle of it and the immobilize will be reapplied.
---
Rampage needs a damage nerf, it's really unfun to get hit by the rock throw, take 7k and get knocked down, and then just die to any other rampage skill. That being said, it's good that they disable a trait like CI because it's really unfun and it compounds the issues that already exist with mirage in pvp; it has many effective evade frames than most classes and it has insane condition burst.
---
That's what I did when I started. Now I have max leveled every class in the game 😂. I started with learning the ins and outs of firebrand and went from there.
---
Howdy; Currently I'm making exordium, it's my first legendary I've actually *wanted*, but I'm debating which path to take, either the HoT gift, or the PoF gift. Anyone have a preference for which is a better way to go?
---
It all depends on how many gem store issues are in the ticket queue.  I had an error buying gems, opened a ticket, fixed within the hour!
---
Not OP imo, but definitely above-average. Good Holosmiths dominate, but it's mostly due to a lot of core engineer stuff.
---
Well, in this case I think it's for the better; the inconvenience for the mesmers who used it is less than the problem it caused for PvP as a whole.
---
In general it's just that Flame is bad. But there is a decent implication that a lot of Renegades came from Blood more than others. Seeing as the Blood imperator is the human hater of the allied region's imperators, it isn't surprising.
---
Pistol/Pistol is fun for open-world since it generates so much might.
---
Trust me, Fractals and Raids are only a small section of the game, and Thief *definitely* has it's merits. Its mobility is unmatched and always has been since 2012.
---
[removed]
---
mine was more like a general comment appliable to the game industry, and surely even without knowing that i new this existed already since a while.
---
... aren't you nitpicking too much for a fun-sized point of view?
---
your image links are unclickable
---
Well I’ll be looking forward to see any future runs,
---
Yikes
---
XD same. I went back to check on it but I can't stand the grind anymore after playing GW2 so much.
---
Sounds good !
---
I just logged in - did one or two story missions and looked through the achievements. 
---
Maybe I will get back into it - it is so sad, I stopped playing when getting Eternity, I didn't really played with it. 
---
Maybe I need the item progression which this game doesnt really have, I don't know!
---
Updated.
---
You seem to have a pretty big issue with these that is shown in the data. 
---
The drop rates within each category are not equal which means tiers are also irrelevant. If rates are not equal then something that is uncommon can easily be rarer than a super rare. This explains your observation with rucksack but also demonstrated by the 20 recipe sheets versus the number of infusions.
---
weird. works for me. I removed the link tag so should just take you to imgur now.
---
How's it less social? The game actively encourages working together at pretty much every opportunity. The only thing it's really missing is alliances for wider social groups.
---
Disappointing results but thank you for taking the time to attempt the gamble on this scale.  If your speculation is correct, this has serious market ramifications as it suggests that in the longterm that the material supply in the game will outpace day to day gold supply.  I agree anet should change festival drops in the bags, but I think they should expand token rewards both in the bag and some minor monetary reward from the zephyrite vendors to recoup some loss.  However, I am always reminded that anet likes to stick with the lore and this festival is all about "donating" to help the zephyrites and gambling will always be hit or miss.
---
Had no issues opening both
---
[Drop rate](https://imgur.com/JHBYLYo)
---
[Value](https://imgur.com/65tKbp9)
---
They can be opened but he formatted them so no words were the link so without RES you couldn't even see there were any
---
Some of it is probably explained by the main language of the person making the ad. For example in Dutch you would use an apostrophe for the plural of an acronym.
---
Ah makes sense
---
The drop rate for the recipe sheets is still low enough to put it in the Super Rare. The Zephryite Rune rate and the Rucksack ones were the anomalies when you sort by drop rate.
---
People still play in 4:3?
---
Well the Zephyrites aren't going to be getting any donations in the future if things don't change at all.
---
"350kp's T4 Dailys"
---
hmmmmmm
---
The old LA wasn't grand. It had character. It had spirit. It had grit. This just isn't the same.
---
This is how I've always wanted the GW2 Reddit to be!!!!!! 
---
YES
---
Elonian Matrix is account bound and required in nearly every PoF deco. That's not some endgame prestige item like the gift of exploration and the globe, that is a standard material.
---
If you have a commander tag, tag up and lead one. Set up early and put up an lfg. I usually check lfg to see if others are doing it and if there is, I will join, otherwise I dont even bother trying.
---
Wow is monetized too, just most of it is in the subscription... some form of monetization is just necessary for an mmo to function.
---
&gt;IIRC you can get trinkets in any stat! That you can reset the stats of. 
---
Only reason to not get trinkets this way is if you are aiming to get the titles since those cost alot of pristine relics and ofc still need a omni potion.
---
I'd rather have them redesign the whole city once again, and this time make it look like a real city, instead of a glorified theme park.
---
Adding some "social" activities to the city would be nice too. A racing track for beetles, an arena using the guild hall or the Armstice Bastion system, etc.
---
Ruined LA was the best, with quarters for every game mode. You had designated guild, WvW, and PvE areas. It was great.
---
They could increase the drop rate by 10x from the bags and it still probably would only go down to about 12-15k on exchange. It'll only go down to under 10k if they increase the drop rate from gerent
---
It's not just nostalgia, old LA was prettier and more interesting to explore.
---
the super rares have their own rates in that table. They're all not weighted equally.
---
Needs more Pre-Searing Ascalon.
---
haha. I'm not complaining about the kp my friend, I'm just talking about the irony of asking for the elites when you write "kp's" and "dailys"
---
Pretty sure it's 20 August
---
In Dutch we still use an apostrophe for the plural form after a vowel. For example, `car` is `auto`, `cars` would be `auto's` as the `o` should be pronounced like the `o` in `open`, but without the apostrophe would be pronounced like the `o` in `off`. 
---
For some reason, they also decided that the plural of `baby` (which we borrowed from English as-is) is not `babies` or `babys`, but `baby's`, which doesn't follow the rule and makes no sense at all
---
Ah yes, metabattle the official build rating site.
---
This is true, and grinding for gold killed many new players, ofc if you joined for grind, you can grind whatever.
---
What about the fact that you need like 250 gold to get the griffon mount in the DLC? Any way around that without grinding for days?
---
What about not rushing the griffon? It's only a grind if you make it one.
---
Engineer?
---
You might should change your character then. :P
---
No its certainly not "good content" and that is the point. Why would they produce good content for free if they can just produce "trash content" like this and people would happily spent 2k gems for?
---
For endgame you have basically 3 builds. Rifle (that's not really super good) dagger/dagger (that's not really super good) and staff (that's really good and really easy to learn rotation). The general rule of thumb in this game is 'if it's ranged it's not good for team endgame'
---
Do you think there is someone out there who thinks destroying LA was a good idea besides the people in charge at Anet? I certainly don't. There was literally no one who I spoke with who was happy with the LA changes. We don't have to worst LA yet but it's still not the Vanilla one. The worst part for me is that they basically wasted resources on a Map that was already done. They could have done a whole new map or something.
---
Yeah seriously. A heavily damaged and poorly repaired LA would have worked fine for story purposes without wasting nesrlt as much resources.
---
Isn't unlocking the griffon the whole point of the DLC, though? As cool as the other mounts are, they're no griffon
---
&gt; ROI 	-34.37%
---
*lel*
---
In German we call it "Deppenapostroph" (idiot's apostrophe) when it's not used for omissions
---
It's not the mount, it's the player
---
You'd love GW1 then. xD
---
You think it'd have been better off if we had zero updates for a year (or more) after launch?
---
You should not buy the endless fractal potion! Convert the 1200 pristine into 18000 fractal relics and buy all three infinite potions. [BUY-2046_PFR](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/BUY-2046_PFR) sells bags of 15 fractal relics for one pristine relic.
---
Don't forget to do your *daylies*
---
It’s not serious its a joke
---
People like him are exactly the reason we get living world episodes for free
---
This is me playing Borderlands 2 and reaching Eridium Blight.
---
I joined after PoF but the story instanced old LA still feels more homey than new LA. It's much better in the coziness and immersion departments imo
---
Apostrophe usage : breaking defiance bars :: grammar : gw2
---
What class is this?
---
How many Elegy Mosaics do you have?  How much Crystalline Ore/Machetes do you have?  That's the primary question.  if you have enough of either already, pick that method.  If not, decide whether you want to run Dragon's Stand a few times, or spend your time on quicker PoF metas over a longer period instead.
---
*looks for fractals
---
Fractals have been fun, but with how small they are and how rare it is to see new ones get released, it’s hard to say we get a lot of fractal content.  Even raids get more updates and that’s saying something.  They’re fun, but when they announced they would be abandoning dungeons in favor for the bite sized fractal mini-dungeons I figured we would at least get a handful of the a year to amount to like, one real dungeon a year.  
---
Living word seems like the only thing thing that gets frequently updated a year, which is great because no other mmo pumps out so much open world content, but I wish other forms of content got a bit more love too.  Some new armor sets would be nice too, for an mmo where cosmetics are supposed to be a primary thing to work towards and unlock, we get a rather pitiful selection of armor, the largest most obvious cosmetics on our characters,  to actually work towards
---
Oh I can definitely see that, I did the Jackal heart (but didn't have the TC to buy the mount) and it seemed pretty nice. Can't fly though, so the griffon still has something none of the other mounts do
---
Oh. Thanks to you I noticed the icon for Bypass Coating in he wiki was wrong. 
---
Fixed now. Grabbed it from the API.
---
https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/skills/29665
---
&gt;It's the "100 times" you should have focused on
---
&gt; we have lines repeated multiple times
---
&gt; You are focusing on the wrong thing
---
Hol' up
---
Can you even get all of those weapon skins yet? I thought those were only in those as the 5x dailies and thus maximum you could have is 5 or 6 or so
---
Was möchtest du denn hauptsächlich machen? Wvw? Oder eher "nur" PvE?
---
Are you sure that you opened 289,568 Zephryite Supply Boxes and not 258,095 boxes?
---
Because there is exactly one guaranteed Quartz Crystal in each box, i.e. it should have a drop rate of 100% and not 89%.
---
Also by dividing the your dropped quanties by 258,095 one gets more or less the same drop rate percentages from [u/sutgon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cjyree/100_000_zephyrite_supply_boxes_drops_value/) or the from [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyrite_Supply_Box/Drop_rate). Otherwise your drop rates are off by ~12%, more or less as much boxes that I suggest you didn't open.
---
I’m reminded of Magic the Gathering, personally. Hell’s Thunder from Shards of Alara, to be precise.
---
Cosmetics.
---
What content are you going to be playing? What role do you want to fill in that content?
---
Thieves are fine for raiding. There are some builds that are better than others, and some encounters that are more suited to Thieves than others. Mursaat Overseer melts to Rifle Deadeye, since it’s basically a DPS Golem that doesn’t move much. Staff Daredevil is great and relatively easy to play, but don’t bring it to Cairn (first boss of Wing 4, the Bastion of the Penitent) because the Staff auto-attack includes projectile reflection which can hurt your squad. Dagger/Dagger is more popular than Pistol/Pistol, but the latter is still useful to have. Short Bow is handy for open world thanks to its mobility and for tagging mobs. Be prepared to have multiple weapons to swap to depending on the situation if you’re a Thief main.
---
tempest for support/hyprid and weaver for dps
---
it's an anagram
---
Tbh, it still is. I agree with you though forreal. It's quite the shame seeing how incredible a map from 2012 is that they've made compares to ones they've made in 2018.
---
Ahh... when I was in your stages, I grinded my a** off in Fractals. xD
---
But yea, overall, enjoy the game, my biggest gold toilet was only a full set of ascended armor and the griffon. 
---
You don't really require gold for almost all other contents. Full Exotic gear, with superior sigil and runes, should be enough for you to do very well. 
---
I haven't farmed gold for quite a while (just chilling in PvP nowadays). But I believe Istan, DS, DF and fractals are still good gold source.
---
It is a leak for LS5.
---
Mostly used by people who think they’re cool but actually dumb.

Which was released in October 2008, almost 4 years before Guild Wars 2.
---
See this post in another topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cgzk3y/casual_post_regarding_furnace_taken/eunh6dn/
---
tl;dr: It's a way of saying something not very nice about a certain company.
---
true, because it's outdated. "face tank rune" is much more on topic now.
---
It's an anagram for Fuck Arenanet that originated from Twitch. It isn't all that clever but if it gets people through the day as they consume the content anyway, whatever helps I guess.

I've been running the PoF and HoT meta dailies for the Gemstones, but, truthfully I have all of the prerequisites done to do it the PoF way; Just, I don't have the needed elegies. I need to unlock all of the masteries for HoT, which are fairly uh, interesting. Having some trouble with the adventures at some of them, I know I need 45 more mastery points to max out the required HoT masteries for the gift of the jungle. So, admittedly? Probably about an equal amount of time to grind out the elegies, compared to getting all of the mastery points as well.
---
Not on topic but man I got chills when Captain America said that to rumlow and agent sitwell.

From the [patch notes](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/83172/game-update-notes-july-30-2019#latest): The Festival of the Four Winds will be available for three weeks, from July 30 until August 20. Enjoy the festivities!
---
nope. i doublechecked afterwards. that number is correct.
---
?
---
You’ve got to be trolling right? No you definitely are I refuse to be baited lol.
---
Be THE man and leave.
---
Judging from your wall of text and the wording of it, I'd say you're pretty offended.
---
Yup, exactly what I mean. It's the design philosophy of keeping rare cosmetics behind rng.
---
I am leaving lmao - pay attention!
---
How? Compared to what? Getting an expansion and MAYBE 1 major update a year? What are you idealizing here?
---
Good, but why not earlier?
---
Only thing you can understand watching others’ PvP.
---
That's not what I meant but thanks for stopping by with the sole intent of being shitty!
---
U welcome
---
personally i doubt that a player who managed to only save up 10g in 5years is gonna do t4 dailies anytime soon
---
especially when that 10g can be made in 5 days by simply tagging matriarch(which takes like 2-5min/day)
---
Rember when mystic coins were 10 silver a piece feelsbad
---
Wait he’s still in the partner program?! 
---
Sorry I haven’t played GW2 in almost a year and barely keep up with it but dang. 
---
With his attitude towards ANET, the game and player. I’m surprised they haven’t cut their losses with him.
---
This has forever in my guild been labeled the "Globe of Disappointment". Sizeable small in comparison to the effort to have it.
---
Depends.
---
Well, the thing is i do. I still want ANet to notice us. It's a great game and well, mechanics are ahead of it's time (by 7 years and counting), well combat ones at least. If i want to leave, i can only go to a game that has inferior combat and well, that just won't do.
---
Since they don't listen when you ask them nicely, might as well make as much drama as possible. Maybe they might listen than.
---
Or you know, maybe all this drama is going to drop population over time and force them to create a new game, which i'm all for, since it seems that there's such spaghetti code in this game that nothing can be done.
---
New LA just looks like a Counter/Strike map. With Final Fantasy music.
---
What.
---
For years I thought they said *"More violence, I say. Less violence."*
---
I was always confused as to why that was a line, never made sense.
---
You will survive more with temprst, weaver is a bit harder to master since its all about dps
---
Ok, wild assumptions here: You do not have enough KP and want to do the daily or CMs. 
---
So why are you not making your own group? find ding 4 other ppl is not that difficult and looking at this lfg there is really low competition for a no KP run.  
---
And plz do not blame the ppl that did this 100-300 times and just want to get this done. it is not fun for them to play with someone that has no clue what they are doing. 
---
And if you think you know what you are doing just get a chat code. Cuse if you understand what everyone is supposed to do there is little to no difference between someone how did it 300x and someone how did it 20 times.
---
It's a bad joke.
---
haha what
---
Okay... but for me it still looks strange. 
---
Let me explain why:
---
The wiki has 130,372 drops documentated, let's say that's ~1/2 of your opened boxes. With that amount of data the drop rate percentage shouldn't differ that much, at least for the common category.
---
For example for copper ore (or any other basic t1 crafting material) you have a drop rate percentage of ~3.8%, but if we divide your drops of t1 materials at ~11,100 by 258,059 instead of 289,568, we get ~4.3%, exactly the drop rate that is documented at the wiki.
---
One can calculate the same for all other common drops, and one will get the same result, the percentages will match with the wiki ones if one uses 258,059 as total amount.
---
Please no offense, just what I'm trying to say is, that there is a discrepancy between any previous drop rate data and yours... and this discrepancy is "exactly" the difference between ~258k and ~289k opened boxes. It can be a coincidence, but with that amount of data, your ~290k vs ~130k from the wiki, the numbers just shouldn't differ that much.
---
Of course, there could be also a change ingame, but still in my opinion, the easiest explanation for me is mine above.
---
Thanks for being helpful! I'll check it out!

What jumping puzzle
---
Diviners is good for boon-sharing DPS
---
Harrier's is perfect for boon-based supports
---
Games are supposed to be fun. If it's not, then do something else :)
---
You mean healers?  How is primary stat power good for healers?
---
More violets. Less violence.
---
It definitely is the dark side. All they do is stir up drama for views and pretend everyone agrees with them.
---
Healing guardian for what game mode?
---
YOU are the dark side :)
---
EAT THE STREAMERS!
---
Well, in the case of something like Renegade, yeah you can just support with full Diviner's.
---
However, Druid's might generation is tied to how fast it can generate celestial force, the majority of which comes from healing. Healing Power gives Druids more celestial force, which allows them to spam more might share. 
---
Also having healers in Fractals and Raids is important, since they make everything so much easier and provide an alternate playstyle since there are so many supports in the game (Herald, Tempest, Scourge, Druid, etc).
---
Juding by this fail English, it must be from toxic EU serv.
---
How dare he criticize the game!
---
I'm sure it's his fault that almost every partner is in the same mood for the game and that they're moving on to other games.
---
Who?
---
What are the odds they wipe on Angry boi then rage quit?
---
When you do something like this the thread gets noticed for something like 5m before it gets hidden due to auto-moderator flags.  I sympathize with wanting more MMORPG goodness; playing FF XIV isn't exactly within my means right now.  Right now I login maybe once or twice a week and run some stress free low level Fractals w/ newbies and help them if it's within my means to explain.  
---
I'm not going to embrace anarchy vs. a company that so strongly desires manufactured, corporate response and control.  If you reflect on TeaTime one of the things that comes up often is ArenaNet's communication policies.  I would argue that your strategy does more damage than good.  It doesn't raise awareness.  It just gives players an excuse to hide an irrational argument and makes the arguments of more moderate players weaker by letting people cherry-pick anarchist doomers (and I hate that description). 
---
Criticism can be looked at as either a concern or a complaint, and that distinction is something this sub is ... 
---
Why not ask Teapot if you can talk on TeaTime?.  If they can make space for people like Envy or Zorrik then surely you can present something of value.  It's hard for the global audience to take streamers and content creators seriously when they're arguing the same arguments week-in and week-out.  It's "non-contestants," that offer surprise and perspective.  It's something I'm considering, but I'm holding my breath until the end of August.  I think we've sufficiently voiced our frustration. 
---
... all that's really left to do is wait and see what they have to offer.  They're not going to unveil anything before then.
---
We lost him to Eurotruck Simulator PepeHands
---
My opinion is a useless bum?
---
Furnace taken
---
Your missing the point.  If someone is running full harriers, their dps is shit, hence the major stat is almost entirely wasted.  
---
I googled, 'snow crows dps log largos twins' and this came up:
---
https://dps.report/i9Oa-20181022-211439_twins
---
The dps are hitting 19k and the druids are below 3k.  Their major stat is power just to hit 3k?  Pretty obvious if they had access to healing stat primary gear they would take it.
---
I had the exact same problem when I started. For me the trick was to use the lvl 80 boost. The main story just didnt grab me, but all the HoT living world and PoF content i enjoyed a lot. 
---
So i rerolled, made a mesmer wich was the class wich mechanics suited me the most. And i started the story over. But this time i just used all my tomes of knowledge i collected trough pvp and daylies.
---
This way i could skip the grind and continue the story. Also I used all xp boosters i had. 
---
For me the grind to 80 is just to much a leftover from the original game to stall gametime. The game really pics up at lvl 80, and its okay to cheese it a little.
---
Hope this works for you to :).
---
this game probably isn't for you, there is little that you really need to do in this game and if none of the optional stuff entices you then you are not going to enjoy that much
---
Thus the
---
&gt; notoriously barefooted Jennah
---
part ^^
---
do you apply this dumb logic everywhere? like when somebody says a pizza place has bad food you go all "i wanna see YOUR pizza"?
---
Oh well, 2% for elite specs.
---
I actually quit in November, when our guild disbanded, than December balance patch just sealed my decision.
---
I've only now started to get more interested, because of expectation that "expansion grade stuff" can only be elite specs. Nothing else is delivered to all 3 modes.
---
Oh well, i hope 30th August comes soon, so i can finally quit GW2 for the last time.
---
every class is good for endgame. its just how you play them. but  also playing warrior, guard or necromancer is much easier than playing thief
---
I understand the appeal, and I much prefer your face to Biks.  It's just that a lot of frustrated players feel the best thing to do right now is to desperately throw as many Molotov cocktails in anets face as possible to try to get their attention.  I think it has the opposite effect.
---
Well your words do hurt my feelings, \*snif snif\*
---
ITT: people who can’t wait a single month for an announcement.
---
How do you how do?
---
Ignore them. If you look at their post history, they're just passive-aggressive trolls.
---
You are probably right. I go on Tea Time to have fun with friends, to talk about the game, joke around quite a bit and so on. Some people won't like the jokes, I get that.
---
This is why I didn't include it on my list. A lot of people throw around the T4 daily as an option, but most people don't run Fractals at all, much less T4 dailies. The amount of casuals and even solo players in this game is staggeringly high compared to other MMOs I've played, or at least it seems that way to me.  But for those who like harder group content, T4 Fractals are indeed a good source of income.
---
Somehow I'm not shocked
---
New on the internet?
---
I specifically avoided this and still reached the cap earlier this year.
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama or violating the CoC is not allowed.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
The difference between 1-2 per year and 1-2 per month is pretty big, and I think I'm somewhere in the middle for most of those responses. Normalized, that's a difference from 1-2 per year to 12-24 per year.
---
The question also doesn't make sense in the context of convenience items as those tend to be one-off QoL investments rather than recurring purchases. In GW2, for example, I already have a character slot for every class, max bank tabs, some extra shared inventory slots, the infinite salvage tools, a set of infinite gathering tools, and a VIP pass. While that's arguably a lot of QoL purchases, none of them are recurring purchases so it's hard to answer the question regarding how frequently I buy them.
---
Not cosy at all! I hate being at this city.
---
Drew a Jade Sea map as it could appear in a future Cantha expansion :)
---
Love for zealot stats on guard!!
---
Didn't know we are allowed post about the dreams we had last night.
---
I like when your interrupt angry cat gets interrupted itself. Poor things flop on the floor from aoe knockback :(
---
I’ve never heard of this one
---
&gt; What could have have been done differently by Arenanet to make it worthwhile for people to participate?
---
Not rly making it worthwhile to participate, but I think -like last year- that this system is a huge missed opportunity at balancing material economy, removing a lot of the less used ones, or giving sinks for many account-bound or otherwise worthless items. The whole list of possible prices for the boxes is stupidly calculated depending on the tp value of each material in a way that all are roughly the same, when it would have been much better to bring the prices using same tier materials closer in order to have people use the worthless ones ... instead of further reinforcing the existing value ratios between materials. No material was added that wasn't there in the first edition of the festival (vanilla materials, 2013) ... while we have a bunch of HoT/PoF materials that are at merchant value (+15%) and would rly be nice to sink here. And of course missed opportunity at a very easy to implement for long requested sinks (tomes of knowledge, exotic essences of luck ...).
---
nice censorship
---
Doesn't change the fact there is a subset of people on this sub trying to stir up as much drama and outrage as possible before the announcement in a few weeks, running circles with their fingers in their ears screaming "dead gaem dead gaem dead gaem".
---
Yup they were in the same box last year.
---
Then mb you can explain pls how to reach some events uder ground in Dragonfall, I'm runnig like idiot with raptor trying to find the way to jump while all ppl just flying there with griffon. It was about this.
---
That right part of the image... *Meme template material right there.*
---
It is very possible that this is a play style issue. I started with a warrior and got so bored that at level 30, I quit him, and the game, for a couple of years. When I came back, I grudgingly leveled him to 80 just to see the end game content. While researching gear, I happened upon a video of someone playing a daredevil thief and it looked super fun so I  bought the expansion, rolled a daredevil and never looked back. The whole game changed and nothing was boring again because I love to see him jump around vs. Warrior which was slow and clunky to me. I'd suggest trying out some other classes. You can go to the pvp lobby and try any class. You won't have to play a match, you can get out the class right there.
---
I need gold to get some skins to better look. It's a bit dissapointed, I moved from eso, because tired, and found gw2 pve more interesting BUT outfit and skin shit is so bad. I mean gw2 is so GREEDY about it. In eso when I was new player I got many free skins and outfits ffrom first week just doing quests. And their system is more friendly with gold too, like you ened just collect mats, all I see here is auction speculation which is worst tbh. Or lagging map converting staff many times and sell. Is it good?
---
I need a couple more red boxes and arrows in addition to the title of the post and the ones in the pic. Otherwise I have no idea what you are talking about.
---
You mean the announcement of another season of unengaging content, which is the reason those  people are frustrated with the game?
---
Don't be so obtuse.
