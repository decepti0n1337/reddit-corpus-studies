What raptor skin is that?  Love the way you have it colored.  I can't seem to find one I like.

---
I have a guild, but sometimes people aren't online and I need to pug to get the dailies done.
---
Hmm, I think we can discuss this for a long time without commin to an end. :P
---

---
Okay, another point, what is about Tixx's Infinirarium? It's a huge airship, they could literally use it to fly over the Black Citadel and any other Charr city/outpost, out of the range of Charr's weapons and bomb them from above. Only counter would be the Charr copters and they don't really have weapons. 
---
A few more ships like this and the Asura could even live there (a bit like the Zepherites), completely out of the reach of the Charr.
---
Question  1) T4s?
---
Question 2) CMs?
---
If not, sure. You can basically carry standard fractals solo anyway if you wanted to. Im 100% positive people get hard carried all the time but think they are doing fine.

Respect the shameless plug, but I've got a guild and not looking for another one. Just have to pug sometimes when we have less than 5 150+ AR people online since my schedule is weird and doesn't always match up with the guildies'.
---
Ahh.. The story of my life. 😓
---
Hmm, I'm pugging both CMs as healbrand since I figured most Druid healers can't even keep themselfes alive ^(even with 200+ kp ffs).

Its best you yourself bring absolute failsafe classes with a hugeass toolkit (Chrono/Guard) and bring power dps. Your personal performance does not matter too much and even dps classes should care about stability, vigor, reflection etc. uptime to **dupe** as many mechanics as possible.
---
Often times I see players not even changing their Weapons / Utilityskills for bossfights. I'd consider those the ultimate braindeds and I'm not even joking, they just 1:1 copy builds directly from snowcrows or discretize without reading the disclaimer and looking into their utilities.
---
Good, now I can't keep a cohesive look while I'm leveling a character or trying out new gear.
---
Was excited to see it listed on the news article, sad it’s a no show. Want it for my ranger with a dragon theme going on over the full dragon head helmet I’m using.

Hoping when dragon mount comes with new story, it’ll show up then and it was a early  announcement mistake. Not a lost dream and complete miss type

It's just the default raptor skin 😊 I think I dyed it with either redemption or preservance, I'm not sure though.

I used to be able to mix them the way I want and I cannot do that anymore nowadays and they are all set in mix configurations I do not like at all and that do not fit any of my toons. I know rigs are not the same for visual armore weight but at least the "visual identity of the professions" is not an excuse anymore due to how far the numerous outfits are from the said profession identities...

I would tend to agree, but I run CMs, so the essence requirement usually tends do weed out the bad players.

I spend about 15 minutes average checking lfg while farming until I see a good team comp. I play glass pdps so I usually wait until I spot a quickbrand/herald + scourge + druid

Join a training group or start your own, as mentioned already. More people tend to look for training when 100 or 99 is a daily fractal, so keep that in mind.

Dodging and reacting and still doing the rotation well makes me really wanna improve or try it again so i can do it too ;'(.

Hello,
---
I'm quite new to GW2, atm I am playing on my lvl 80 ranger but I'm still not sure about the endgame. I read/watched few different guides, but I'm still not sure if I understand GW2 correctly. Is the endgame gear aka ascended or legendary pretty much all the same with difference in attributes distribution and can you buy this gear on TP? Or is there some progression like in traditional MMOs, where you grind dungeons / raids and you can get drops based on your ilvl ? Or what's the endgame goal? Make money, buy gear and farm transmog? I'm so confused.
---
By the gods, how powerful is ANet making him!?
---
It depends on the armor.
---
It took me a while to find properly matching colors on my charr engineer.
---
I recommend you enable showing dyes you don't have unlocked, sorting by hue and trying dyes in the blue and gray hues one by one.
---
First dye everything with the same gray color until you find colors that match, then dye details with blue.
---
Then purchase the dyes you picked if you don't have them.
---
Frankly I've learned more details about fractals reading through this thread than i learned in months of running them.
---
You want to complain about people who don't know mechanics? Sure, that's perfectly natural. But so is *not knowing stuff.* 
---
Unknowledgeable players merit complaint but not condemnation. Of course people are just gonna not know stuff. So if you know this stuff and care this much, maybe invest your energy in saying these things *in party chat* rather than here.

I do feel like it's shady... and probably unnecessary, considering the fact that redditors in general are pretty quick to make actual posts about this kind of thing once they see it (and LA and New York are both big enough places that the chances of a redditor seeing them is pretty good, I'd say).
---
At the same time, though, I don't blame them for wanting to ensure we see it, considering how quickly (and unfairly, IMO) reddit becomes a place where negative opinions grow and multiply. This community is largely responsible for spreading a lot of the "the game is dying" sentiment, which hurts the whole game, so we kind of deserve to have our own echo chamber used to do the opposite.
---
Well, i think that the main "problem" of tools is that, unlike the mount, they have a monetary return in game and on their own they can be used to eliminate a potential expense, even if small, that a player can have.  
---
If they were too cheap, people would just cry for "P2W"....So it goes from the "common" must have thing, to a pricey commodity that takes many years of use to become actually profitable. On the other hands no one gives a damn if your mount cost even 50 bucks. Since it's just a skin.  
---
This is at least my opinion on why a basic ass gathering tool cost more than a mount skin....moreover if we reeeally want to be picky. We're talking about actually 3 items vs 1 skin. So the comparison isn't totally on par.  
---
That said...I would love if mounts were priced a bit less xD If i wanted to charge real money for it, i would have to buy 1600 gems and something more, but since there isn't a 400 gems option (even if many things are priced like that) I have to charge a minimum of 800 more ...which is quite stupid, smh.

That's messed up and should never happen.

I'm probably not gonna change your mind, because I'm obviously biased towards finding bugs/arachnids, etc cute(not all), but I'm gonna try. 
---
To start I'm gonna show some [Bee Flies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rebecca_Kittel/publication/328232542/figure/fig6/AS:680811032477697@1539329407435/Adult-of-Anastoechus-nitidulus-Credit-karakotokako-2007-image-retrieved-from.jpg) they're what the Pokemon [Cutiefly](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/f/fa/742Cutiefly.png/1200px-742Cutiefly.png) was based off of, and you can see they don't go very far from the mark at all.

I also want to show some [Dung Beetles](https://media.giphy.com/media/ha0ihj0UdzqP6/giphy.gif), despite being kind of gross because feces, they're pretty [cute](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fb/b8/b6/fbb8b6a73ecee0996f4879acb492cec8.jpg) imo. Also a certain species of them have been proven to use the [stars/milky](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130124123203.htm) way to navigate! I've found for myself the way I got into not being weirded out by the bug world is researching it.

I also find millipedes pretty cute, I mean look a their [antennae](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/MCAFBY/white-millipede-close-up-of-her-head-eyes-and-mouth-visible-macro-photography-MCAFBY.jpg), they look like they're from a cartoon! 
---
I used to be pretty uncomfortable looking at ants or centipedes as well, still a little bit on the centipedes, but I've been reading about ants lately and learning about them and they're pretty neat. They have pretty complex social structures. I've found researching and learning more about certain species helps make myself feel more at ease with it, and even find them cute.
---
Yes. XD I reckon this is the most likely place for the next map. The teasers oddly support my personal theories on it, too.
---
Then the Skyscape combined with a monthly tournament win gizmo, a WvW tentacle chestpiece at 2000 rank and the Tarrktun vendor item to give you Build Templates from the mystic forge.
---
yeah, I kinda figured that would happen since you can see the lost item beside the exit rift.
---
&gt; If they were too cheap, people would just cry for "P2W"....So it goes from the "common" must have thing, to a pricey commodity that takes many years of use to become actually profitable. On the other hands no one gives a damn if your mount cost even 50 bucks. Since it's just a skin. 
---
I don't want it to be profitable, I want it to be convenient. I just want to not carry around tools in my bag, and then get caught out without one and have to teleport. They should just bite the "it's P2W" bullet and make the game better.
---
Using insult to justify you own insults, no you are *not* better.

Not really, no. In WvW, those are completely other dimensions. Like three dimensions fighting against each other.

---
&gt;  THIS IS WHY WE HAVE A BOAT RIFLE
---
The SS Divinity is actually one of the nicer legendaries in the game. It has really good sfx, projectiles, and aura.
---
The only problem with it is the stupid sailboat aesthetic.
---
Had it just been a baddass cannon, I think it would've been one of the best legendaries in the game.
---
Yeah, I think that's the thing that most "just split them up" people tend to forget - since they aren't technically transmuted over your gear, you don't have to worry about it during leveling up a character every time you replace gear.
---
The truly ideal situation would be a *combination* - that is, you have outfits as they exist, but unlocking an outfit also unlocks transmutable pieces into the wardrobe.
---
I'm guessing they changed the drop rate around the start of 2014. If you [look at the volume on the market on GW2Spidy](https://www.gw2spidy.com/item/20316), it hits its max of about 8 million sell listings around then (for about 4 copper a piece -- this was the typical market price for them for a long time). After that, the supply starts dropping, but it takes a dang long time to burn through that pile of 8 million chests (the number of sell listings finally drop below a million by the end of August).
---
IIRC I sold a couple stacks of 250 back when they were only going for about 5 copper each back then. They were wasting precious bank space, and it wasn't like they were hard to come by if I decided I actually wanted some...

Someone just reported this comment to us under voting manipulation and looking into it that might very well be the case. While there is nothing wrong with either post the fact that this account is 2 months old and this was it's first post and the other one is 7 years old with barely any activity is certainly very suspect. 
---
As there is nothing rule breaking with either post or the comment I am leaving them up but I am tagging both accounts as possible fakes. Won't be taking any further action at this point but will monitor them and keep a closer eye on other posts like this.
---
(Please keep in mind this information is for fractals and can lightly be applied to raids)
---
Healing necroes are basically gods of carrying bad players. The barrier application to 'cheese' some mechanics, and last rites and vampiric aura make it very easy for bad players to not die.
---
Druids are basically gods of carrying good players (the good players don't need carried, druids just make things very smooth and fast). The permanent 25 might stacks, constant heals, and unique damage and precision buffs make the good players do tons more damage.  The tradeoff for the incredible offensive utility is the lack of defensive utility, but that doesn't matter for good players since they know mechanics and how to stay alive.
---
Overall druid is considered better/meta because, as stated above, healing necroes have more tools to keep people from dying, while the druid has more offensive utility.  Since the good groups don't need all the defensive stuff to keep them alive, the druid is the best choice of the two.
---
Not directly what you asked, but it is relevant info and since I'm writing this much, may as well go all out:
---
The druid is considered a must in almost all meta comps because of how nicely wrapped everything is in one nice healer box, however there are team comps that can function at a high level without druid. They just need their bases covered (might, quickness, alacrity, fury, healing). As an example:
---
1. Ventari/glint rev for heals, alacrity, and fury, and might
---
2. Diviner Quickbrand for quickness and might
---
3. Banner warrior (can be replaced with dps)
---
4. Dps
---
5. Dps
---
Note that a necro healer is not in this comp. While this is one of many druid-less comps that could function at a higher level, necroes likely won't be in any.  Again, this is due to the lack of offensive buffs/boons.  That said, for fractals the meta can go fall off a cliff with the elitists since there's no enrage timers. Surviving is required, not high dps.  You should play what you want and what you find fun.  However for raids, (as much as I hate to type this) I don't think you'll ever find a healing necro solely due to the lack of offensive buffs it brings.  The exception to this being training runs or a static group that already has plenty of dps and is not worried about improving clear times.
---
This turned out much longer than I thought so I guess I'll add a concluding statement: I hope this answered your question and informed you about anything else relevant!  If I'm blatantly wrong about anything please correct me so that I can edit this post for anyone who finds it in the future.  Sorry if the post is hard to read due to bad formatting, I'm posting it on mobile.
---
Trace out.
---
I appreciate your zeal, but you're focusing on entirely the wrong part of my post.  Dude had 6 comments, 5 of them in this thread.  The sixth was a post from a few days ago with a generic thanks to the support team for helping with some issue.  Account was created 5 months ago (yes, that's 5 months before they made a single post).  He was one of the first to post in this thread.  Nearly immediately after I made that comment, he replied (click, not the actual dev account).  The account is even deleted now.
---
Could I be wrong?  Sure.  But you're asking me to choose between the following two scenarios:
---
1) Some guy with a decent amount of advertising knowledge created a Reddit account.  Posted nothing for five months.  Happens to be one of the first to see this post, which we already do know was created by a dev in a fake account (for some reason?).  Posts a stream of incredibly in-depth questions.  Manages to have a conversation with a dev (not incredibly rare, mind you).  Deletes his account.
---
2) Anet dev creates a Reddit account to use later.  Realizes a bit late that having literally no posts will look suspicious.  Uses account to ask some leading questions in a thread that, again, we already know was created under false pretenses.  Agrees with other user who's already pointing out why OP is incredibly suspicious, presumably in an attempt to distract.  Makes incredibly fast reply to user who replied to the dev comment, not his comment.  Deletes account.
---
If you can't see why I find the second scenario more likely, I really don't know what to say.  Have you been around long?
---
Again, I'm not particularly mad.  I'm going to keep playing.  I just don't know why companies keep doing this sort of thing.
---
Eh, I feel that's rather, I dunno, stretching the complaint a bit. "Yeah, it's new content, but it's not new content I can do repeatedly for profit!"
---
But it is something that you'll always have access to as the game ages, like gliding. It's something they can make content for in the future. Even if the process of getting it is a one-time non-replayable thing.
---
Every class does everything and viable in most places besides raids and maybe fractals.
---
I use that button for push to talk, i tried and I’m not skilled enough to handle 24 thumb buttons.  I could use them for mounts though.
---
Amen.
---
Depends on the instabilities in my experience.
---
would've been =/
---
if you have testimonies of heroics from WvW, you can trade in 250 for 250 hero points. 
---
Other than that, just spend the time in PoF and HoT. If you can latch onto a HP train in HoT, it goes by really quickly. If not, PoF hero points are all pretty easy to get on your own, and you can complete a single elite spec within a few hours tops
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fiery_Dragon_Sword
---
No.
---
It probably does look a bit weird if you've never seen that style of advertising before, but it's fairly common in big cities in the US.  That said, I can't remember the last time I saw it being used for something that wasn't a concert or music-related.
---
straightforward.
---
i like it.
---
Healing Druids are glorified DPS supports, you might as well bring a diviner Soulbeast and can roughly expect the same hps.
---
For fractals a shieldscourge or healbrand are way more versetile since you -surprise- actually have a fcking healer.
---
Something big and huge, when we draw it, we get extra djinn like arms to carry it. Or when we draw the gs, we summon extra arms to carry a bigger spirit like version of the gs in our hands and mirrors our gs animations, or something...
---
Mesmer - even after nerfs  
---
PvE - still considered as a great support;  
---
PvP - still considered OP;

roaming - still annoying as f\*\*k;

I mean, my favorite set is the Gallant so I obviously don't have any issues with simplistic designs.  In fact I hate a lot of black lion sets because they're so damn busy that they don't even look like weapons anymore.  I appreciate more subdued designs.

Sure it's easy but at least there's something in the game...
---
true enough. Me and a friend tried to get a static rolling for our usual time slot to hammer out fotm quick and ez..... first time with a all guildie run 1 guy was camping hammer warrior, and the other 2 were missing 10-15ar and didnt get how that was an issue on T4. Ive had great experiences with guildies also but that was the worst.
---
Don't be nervous!  The community in gw2 is great and most people are understanding and will help if you ask.
---
I think I'll answer your question with a checklist of things I expect from T4 players.
---
0. Obviously, have enough AR (exception if you've done t4s on a different armor class and know what agony attacks to avoid)
---
1. Know what your roll is and how it fits into the group (dps, healer, boons/support)
---
2. Know what your skills do
---
3. Know mechanics and when to cc
---
4. Have fractal potions and food appropriate for your build
---
Things that separate good players from great players:
---
1. Know your rotations for optimal and maximum dps/heals/boons
---
2. Know when to stop dpsing if things are going bad and you are needed to rez or kite the boss away from bodies.
---
3. This is a personal one, but if you blatantly mess up, I respect players who spend revive orbs to acknowledge the mistake and keep the run going smooth.
---
4. Know skips to speed up your runs (example: soloing the oven in the thaumanova reactor fractal)
---
I really would like to see Mesmer staff (or scepter) to be on par with Greatsword for tagging. I main condi-mirage in PvE and I love it but I hate being forced to use greatsword for ANY open world content where I have to tag an enemy. If I'm not in melee range greatsword is required. 
---
Greatsword auto, 5 targets. Greatsword ambush, 5 targets. Throw a sigil of stamina on it and you practically get constant ambush. Scepter is 1 enemy for both auto and ambush. Staff does hit multiple enemies it goes back and forth to an ally and foes and combine that with it's disgustingly slow projectile speed in pve zergs everything is dead before your projectile even got there. It's ambush is better but still no where near what greatsword is.
---
I would really love to see the staff projectile and attack speed get a massive speed increase so it does not feel so damn miserable in open world group events. Or if not that some changes to scepter. It just would be nice to have some tagging ability on the condi side so we're not forced to use greatsword.
---
&gt; its really easy if you hold your cc until at like 40-50 %..
---
assuming your party has quickness/fury/25might (alac is always nice too) you have auto attack the boss until shields then run out kill the bby ooze then come back wait for the shield form to expire and drop everything on the boss and its a kill everytime unless your dps players are all really really bad.
---
No way. Not unless they make custom outfit templates that are completely free, and free to switch between. The best part about outfits is you don't have to spend transmutation charges hand over fist if you want to change your looks to suit your mood.
---
Before outfits were diverse enough, I had to keep eight or nine different complete armor sets transmuted to my favorite skins, so that I wouldn't bleed transmutation currency (stones, then charges later) if I wanted to look different on a particular day. Outfits solved this problem completely, don't take that away.
---
get a pistol pistol build, load up on food/utility and exp boosters and run around killing everything(kill mobs that have been alive for a while for the bonus exp) and doing some map comp. Its not world record time but its damn fast.
---
Buff Lava Font's damage back to its original value without changing anything else about the skill. Just straight up revert it to its original state.
---
OP spoke about herald and not rev, you have the reading comprehension of a dead skunk
---
If there's one thing I cannot stand in Fractals, it's when someone has enough AR with one weapon, but if they switch to another weapon, they don't have enough AR and just act like it's not a big deal.
---
Otherwise, it never bothers me to pug up. Unless, of course, you get that one person who dies once and immediately says we need a healer and refuses to budge unless someone switches to Druid or some kind of healer.
---
Yes, the class you're looking for is the mesmer. It's great at everything in all existing, future, imaginable, unimaginable, and unknowable game modes.
---
try it and let us know how it goes.
---
My elementalist's named Sabrewing and is in all violet and black.  No points for guessing my favorite here.  (:
---
&gt;Also, you’re talking to someone that solos 100CM first boss to pass the time. 
---
You are the second *necromain* that tries to brag to me about soloing fractal bosses when cornered, lol. 
---
No, I'm not off tangent. I've seen people like you that are eager to justify themselves with thatever made up bullshit, even when they are faced with rought dps numbers. "Oh, I'm a boonrip!", when both normal fractal team compositions have not one, but two classes, that can boonrip without sacrificing much. "Oh, I'm doing cleave!", when any power class can do the same amount of cleave in 2 seconds after a pull, and some  of them can also pull for themselves. "Oh, I'm a condi, I need a ramp up time", when WHY THE FUCK DID YOU EVEN BRING CONDI IN A FRACTAL RUN?! 
---
&gt;I usually deal top dps 
---
Because usually you are playing with trash. T-R-A-S-H. After reading this thread and looking at such people, I'm convinced, that if it comes to me having to play with players like these, I'd choose not to play fractals at all. An I don't even have leet high standarts.
---
Actually we have legendary runes confirmed, not gs. This tread is all about broken dreams ^^
---
Give elementalist a torch so they can play with tempreture
---
If you aren’t the only one. Talk to the other mesmers and find out who will be veil 1 or 2 or 3.
---
1. **Revenant:** Remove weapon-swap like it was during the HoT Beta, but add legend-specific modifiers to the weapon skills (For example [staff 4](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Renewing_Wave) could do damage &amp; apply Conditions while in Shiro or Mallyx, while in Jalis it could give boons and in Ventari it would heal)
---
  This would create something somewhere between Elementalist and Thief skills (Legends = Elements; Energy = Initiative)
---
2. **Elementalist:** remove one of the elements elementalist can equip, instead they get to select each of the 3 they equip; and where they are on their skill-bar (F1, F2, F3). this allows their individual traitlines to be more specialized; while having Arcane as the overarching line that affects everything a little (a-la *invocation*)
---
What’s wrong with imgur?
---
lmao hi bird buddy :D
---
so?
---
Laugh all you want. Necro had so many tricks up its sleeve to cheese mechanics, such as soloing Thaumanova and skipping Aetherblade laser floor. It was so diverse, almost chrono level. Of course, not many people know that because most immediately dismiss necros as a meme class. You know, players like you. 
---
I would’ve kept playing condi Reaper if it were viable, but alas Scourge killed the class.
---
build templates
---
FWIW - in the past when this has happened, we have one member of the raid group who CAN enter the instance leave the group.  Then the others are usually able to join the instance, then re-invite the first person who then joins the instance.
---
Don’t know if it will work (ie if it’s the same issue I’ve seen in the past) but something to try at least.
---
adding to this: generally the mobs that've been alive the longest are the non-aggressive wildlife. Go murder some Moas
---
I know the layoffs were really painful, and thungs were really hectic and scary over there. But I really think whatever changes in management and practices they made are much better than what they were doing before.
---
More people are working on gw2, its getting way more marketing, they're communicating with the connubity better.
---
I. really happy with how much better things are getting.
---
That fps.. more than my ingame
---
Support players tend to be 2-3x more competent than the average dps player luckily...
---
Correct! He has completed 1 zone!
---
Which zone? If you just did Zone 3, you would have completed 1 zone, and it would display "1/2" (The 2, because it's a tiered achievement. It goes 0/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/3)
---
If you just did Zone 2, you would have completed 1 zone, and it would display "1/2".
---
If you just did Zone 1, you would have completed 1 zone, and it would display "1/2".
---
Now, with that, which of the three did he do?
---
Change elementalist/tempest/weaver Fire trait line to a condition burning spec, change Air to a power dps spec.
---
IMO it doesn't gel well having two trait lines trying to be more or less power dps, so buff both in their respective speciality.  Effectively frees up one trait line so fire/earth or fire/arcane instead of fire/air, or air/arcane..
---
It depends on what you're used to.  Just clearing fractals is the low bar.  Clearing comfortably without much communication is the dream.  You can usually just spot bad players out by the information gleaned from their status bar portraits, positioning, damage taken or things like movement signets or low dps.
---
? class =/= build
---
Kralkatite!
---
Honestly the ability to raise an undead army would be cool... let’s say you kill something, raise it from the dead and it’s your temporary minion.
---
... let’s just say when I made my necro years ago, i was a little disappointed.
---
They don't have 11 mil total players. They have 11 million accounts.
---
So yes, it's a lie.
---
&gt; Complain to Gaile
---
HA
---
I'm sorry, no. This is bullshit and I'm glad it will never happen. I ***LIKE*** being able to change my appearance at will without needing to constantly farm or purchase transmutation charges.
---
Druids (Ranger) are the go-to healer, for sure, but plenty of other classes can heal viably as well. I used to heal as necro; they're a barrier healer, sort of like scholar if you've played ff14? Revenant and guardian can also heal but I haven't had any experience playing those. Elementalists and engineer are pretty strong if you can manage to play them; they're just really complex and can feel weak if you're not experienced in them. If you like supporting more broadly there's a ton of options-tempest, chronomancer, ranger and herald are a few that come to mind.
---
I swear that SAB is buggier this year than previous years.
---
Try nvidia geforce now. Doesn"t even require you to run the game on another device in order to play on your laptop
---
Depends. For wanting to draw in new players, I quite agree. For keeping old ones engaged or coming back though, I feel there could be more effective avenues.
---
Especially players who quit, you get them back by advertising sweeping changes. Full WvW rework including a full rework of all maps and underlying mechanics, removal of item stats or traits, secondary classes, that kind of stuff.
---
Razer products have the ability to change keybindings by changing a profile, as I assume most gaming peripherals.
---
Make Charr cocktails in-game consumable items.
---
If you want fast exp, do what the others say, story and dungeons + hearts if you are tired of dungeons, then hit up Ulgoth Modniir and Ogre Wars. With maximum exp per kill buffs from food and boosters I could go from 33 to almost 45 in less than a couple hours thanks to all the adds during the Ulgoth pre-events and multiple bosses during Ogre Wars. It helps to bring a shortbow for these events to tag as many enemies as possible since people usually AOE them to death near instantly. Sadly, no one really does Ogre Wars anymore but Ulgoth is still done regularly. Hell, most of the exp comes from Ulgoth events anyways.
---
If you want to actually learn to play your thief, level to 80 any way you want, fast or slow. Then, once you hit 80 you go to Heart of Thorns maps, starting with Verdant Brink, and try to solo as many Hero Challenges as possible. A lot of these challenges were designed to be done with small groups so doing them solo will be a good test. I found this to be a fantastic way of forcing myself to learn my traits and weapons on alts to overcome a diverse set of encounters.
---
This is cracking me up far too much.
---
Its a recurring festival since last year.
---
Aside from AutoHotkey scripts and, like stated by others already, software from peripheral manufacturers I don't think there's something like you're looking for, I'm afraid
---
In Guild Wars 2 skills vary a lot from the weapon choice and class specific mechanics like attunements on ele or kits on engineers. 
---
I'm sure you'll find a way to a change in keybinds, though personally I found that I have to change keybinds a bit for the different games I play
---
I know this isn’t what you asked but honestly, you shouldn’t try to do this. It’s just going to make playing multiple classes and weapon sets harder for you in the future. You’ll adjust fast, I promise.
---
1. Barrier doesn't have to be a boon in order for it to receive an other interaction. 
---
2. Deep Wound doesn't have to be added to every game mode at release, and could incrementally be added to content once the devs understand how to use it properly.
---
Spear for Warrior :D
---
More rifles. I dont care who gets it I just want more rifle after crafting predator.
---
Longbow for Necromancers, give us poisoned arrows *or* sword for Necromancers, let us shoot black magic from the blade.
---
I'd like a Dual Pistol Elementalist with elemental traps.
---
No illusions for mesmer spec
---
You'll want to use ascended salvage kits you get (technically better to wait on drops rather than buy them) and [attune](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attuned_equipment) the ring for more [stabilizing matrix](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stabilizing_Matrix) drops (you'll need them later).
---
I were soloving this achievements for my friends while they were afk at the begining of the maze. Took me almost half hour because you need to make it perfect but I quite enjoyed the achievement. Challinging in a way when you need to choose your character for it. There are just few of them wich can make it. My friend did it with chronomancer and I did it many times with my thief. Thief with shortbow, shadowstep and with shadow trap and you will be set.
---
Or do the best of both worlds: Keep them as a outfit but also cut them up into individual pieces. You get your cost free outfit and the players who want to mix spend charges.
---
Unarmed martial arts for every profession.
---
Its impressive that most minions look fresh. I wonder what product they use.
---
I mean, having gs is kinda fine if you use consumables
---
yes i did. It inspired me to log in and check what the hype was all about.
---
Ill send you 2 stacks of bird food as royalties
---
Branded Ugly
---
yes, for 2000 gems, but seeing how others got it the "easy exciting way"... the BLChests price bumped up
---
wow gz!
---
No you? I'll continue kicking all of these builds tyvm.
---
Oh they give this opportunity and sell some individual pieces for 300 gems each (those glowing pieces with blue flame), I doubt that the community wants it to be implemented that way.
---
hmm that looks more like a hammer
---
Here we go, in whatever order they came to ke.
---
Bard Mesmer, give them a Shortbow they can pluck like a harp. Chronomancer is a tank, Mirage is a PvP monster, so maybe make this as a viable alternative to Druid for dedicated healer?
---
Lawbringer Guardian, offhand Pistol. Carry the Punishments from Scourge over. I like the idea of a Judge Dredd styled Guardian, maybe a crueler twist on the class to contrast the bookish Firebrand and noble Dragonhunter. The Torment/Cripple found on Punishments fit that aesthetic. You can't outrun the long arm of the law.
---
Ritualist Revenant, Scepter(s?), channeling Master Togo from Factions. I know people (my guild at least) want a Ritualist Necromancer, but the art of necromancy and the use of channeling The Mists are not the same. One is death magic, the other is demonic. Let's keep in mind Guild Wars demon lore states they're specifically from The Mists. With that in mind, a Demonologist Revenant might be cool.
---
Ronin Thief, Greatsword. Another Canthan option, I like the idea of Thieves picking up the mantle of left by Assassins. After the whole "Tagachi" thing, I could see some backlash resulting in Assassins going underground, such that they thematically resemble free-roaming, masterless Samurai known as Ronin. The Greatsword would essentially be a form of cover, dual blades being too obvious. Stances could be a cool utility.
---
Beastmaster Ranger, Hammer. Controversial opinion, but I'd like to see the Minions from Necromancer brought over to Ranger. I like the idea of my Ranger being a zoo.
---
Arcanist Elementist, Axe/Mace. Another controversial opinion. Tempest supercharged Attunements in Overloads, Weavers fused elements. Arcanists loose Attunements completely, they are tied exclusively to Arcane magic. In exchange, they get Weapon Swap. Or less dramatic, they get a 5th Attunement, the Arcane Attunement.
---
Necromancer, give them a Sword just so every class can use them and a "ghostly" theme as opposed to the blood and gore of core Necromancer.
---
Golemancer Engineer, Staff, Scepter or Axe? Take a page from the Asura. Holosmith traits were themed around building your lightsaber, maybe this one is about customizing your Golem. The Elite Skill could be jumping into your Golem, Ironman style.
---
Warrior. Uuuuuh. Pistol? Shortbow? A Warmarshal or Commander type support thing? No clue. Then again, give us one-handed spears and we can finally go full Spartan.
---
Mesmer with rifl or Hammer
---
ooooor, we could go to cantha?
---
Mainhand shield for Guardian so I can build a wall and make others pay.
---
Illusionary shroud.
---
How very expected.
---
Ay, Belinda's Greatsword would come handy.
---
Stats are stats. It doesn't matter where you get them from. They all go into the same pool and the final number is what matters. 
---
Lots of build guides online are based on being the *absolute mathematical best*, which is a level of optimisation you don't really need if you're not trying to break records. If your gear is 50% 'optimum' and 50% 'near enough', you'll still be able to hold your own in a raid.
---
Oil, food and the +10%BD sigil of concentration will help your BD by about 20-25%, so you probably want to aim for somewhere between 40 and 75% from gear. I see nothing wrong with aiming for 100% total, although raid speedrunners generally avoid it as it sacrifices a bit of damage. For fractals, more is definitely better.
---
I'd love a Shaman Ranger with Focus for the offhand. Imagine some of the stuff the Olmakhan can do in terms of skills - for example summoning a big elemental and being more focused on the elemental side of nature. :D
---
Necro duelling spec. Maybe sword or shield. Blocks/evade frames and mobility.
---
There's enough human based lore. I hate the Charr but I'd rather get more of their lore before getting more human lore. Heck the story of hyleks would be more interesting.
---
GS is something I always wanted thief to have tbh. And I think a samurai theme would fit nice with the thief even tho it may feel close to daredevil
---
* You seem to already know how some zones work, so you can focus on those familiar ones so you are able to finish them quicker
---
* blaze trough your starting zone, its quick, its packed, its simple, and lower levels take less exp to lvl up
---
* Tag events for exp, you dont actually need to go trough them fully.
---
* Spend 2 gold and lvl your cooking to 400, should give you around 10 levels
---
* spend 10 gold and lvl jewelry crafting, should give you another 10 levels
---
* Do story missions, you can skip all dialogue if youre not interested and want speed and efficiency
---
* Do your dungeons, once per day, it boosts your exp by 70% towards your next level every time you finish a path (including story mode).
---
* Use exp boosters, food+ utility buff is 25% exp bonus on kills, guild hall tavern exp boost is another 10% towards ALL exp sources, fireworks give 5% more.
---
* With those exp boosters, you can go and kill neutral mobs, or mobs that are "off the beaten path". Those mobs are ignored by players, meaning they stay alive for a long time, and the longer a mob is alive, the larger the exp bonus you will get, which is further boosted by your exp boosts. For comparison, 10 such mobs with full bonus exp can give you slightly more exp than a finished event.
---
* Stay in zones that are appropriate to your level, If you have a bit more to map complete in a lower lvl do it, otherwise move to a new zone and get better exp
---
Are there any weekly hero point trains for Heart of Thorns? I remember there was one I did a couple of times sometime last year, but I don’t remember any details.
---
Hammer necro big cleave big cc letsgo
---
I went for a melee duelling spec. To be fair necros do lack a decent 1200 range weapon. Staff is OK in certain situations, but hits like a wet noodle.
---
Which is the strongest argument against it, but we can hope. That, or they get a new offhand to bring back Dual Wield skills.
---
I managed to get each level down to 10/20/20 respectively. Which isn’t too bad. It’s not anywhere near the times capable in world 1 but I’m happily finished with those collections now lol
---
They’re stuck as bannerslaves so long as the utility on those outweigh the warriors personal dps, and with how their traits work currently, you just need to bring kick or stomp just to keep a damage buff active while you have your banners out. At least they can use axes recently as a DPS build, it used to ONLY be GS.
---
You can generally find them on weekends. They still definitely run.
---
I guess offhand sword would be a possibility
---
Bugs I've encountered:
---
Health is 0, but still alive
---
Completed the zone in normal mode, loaded into next zone, daily didn't register
---
Stuck in hidden rooms that require mushrooms/trampolines to exit 
---
Checkpoint launching doesn't always work
---
Sometimes pots inside shops can't be destroyed by hitting, sometimes they can, and when you pick them up to smash they don't count as destroyed for dailies.
---
Invulnerability after getting hit by enemies doesn't work and you just get hit over and over until you die.
---
I know and it makes me sad as Warrior is my Main for over 4 years :(
---
I’d say start with W1, as W2 will later on require a flute and is generally harder than W1. There’s not really a reason to do a specific zone as you need all the zones coins to craft 1 skin
---
What's bunker meta?
---
Im thinking it might be something like [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/thumb/7/73/Dhuumseal.jpg/329px-Dhuumseal.jpg).  Strong, heavy, sturdy, bulky, but not massive. 
---
Cool subtle but noticeable swinging animations, "slow" animation for both hands, and only the edges of the sword would be shiny rather than the entire thing covered with a heavy glow.
---
I had this happen far too often. So frustrating.
---
Just to add on that you can buy "deeply discounted fractal keys" and use them to open the chests. It is almost always profitable to do so and running fractals can be a quick source of gold.
---
I'd actually hope for a Mace, because how rare offhand Mace is, and I want to give Thieves all the Stuns / Dazes. Imagine. All the CC and Interruptions in the world. Plus Stealth. PvPers would explode
---
Ouch.
---
wow, great ideas, really makes me crave for new specs...
---
Actualy i always consider infinity coin for tribunal event as first pay2win items in the game 5
---
To the commando class are people from actual earth
---
Ricochet - The Trickshot Mesmer with pistol mainhand
---
My first time on the 100Cm, we have a power chrono with us. we were 4 guildies attempting it (we knew the mechanics, we made a "training group" for it) and this guy joined with 250+ AR (wtf ?) and around 30k AP. He basically did alone the 7 last % of Arkk.
---
Don't remember his/her/w.e name, but we sure were spoon fed this day
---
Na, he was very far away, he was hitting a wizard.
---
Oh, wait
---
&gt; WvW:
---
roaming - still annoying as f**k;
---
WvW isn't really balanced with roaming in mind, and squads rarely want to run more than 1 mesmer (which are a dime a dozen) in a squad, especially since most wvw guilds already have that role easily filled. Don't get me wrong mesmers are meta-defining in pve and spvp, but wvw is definitely their weakest point.
---
And regardless mesmers don't really have that great versatility like what the OP wants. For that playstyle fantasy he's better off with a ele or a rev, even if they have less op utility than a mesmer.
---
we explored the sylvari lore once... 
---
...many people died
---
it's basicly the only option RN
---
Since we have ranged Greatsword I would love to see melee Longbow.
---
&gt; samurai thief
---
ronin thief, a rogue
---
You just don't stop keep moving forward and even as who has stubby clumsy fingers can do it and get both infusions.
---
For the mix-and-match system to work, armor pieces are subject to some strict technical restrictions. Each piece has size limitations to avoid clipping with other armor pieces, the seams must be at fixed positions, there are per-piece restriction on rendering complexity etc. And those restrictions are different for each armor weight.
---
The outfit system wasn't just designed to avoid creating three weight classes, it was also designed to get rid of all those technical restrictions. Not just about making it easier to design an outfit, but also to enable outfit designs that simply wouldn't work with the restrictions of the mix-and-match system.
---
So as much as we'd love to have individual pieces, we can't have both the release frequency and artistic variety of outfits, and the mix-and-match of armor pieces.
---
Geez you are right. Time flies.
---
Pretty much what I felt when I browsed whats up on the statuettes and lo and behold, laundry list of outfits at 30 statuettes each.
---
I'd be happy for waiting :)
---
A new Elite spec for Elementalist. Let's call it Sage.
---
Around Tyria, Elementalists known as Sages are renowned as masters of their chosen element. Sages have foregone the ability to wield all elements at once to instead specialize in just a single element.
---
The core concept of the Sage would be to deliver on two primary goals: the first would be to allow the Elementalist to truly specialize in just one element at a time, delivering on a class fantasy of being an "ice mage", or a "fire mage", rather than being everything at once.
---
The second goal for the Sage's class design would be to cover a traditional class weakness -- since Elementalists can't weaponswap, they're stuck fighting at whatever range their primary weapon is designated for. If an Elementalist is using a staff and an enemy closes distance, the Elementalist usually has no recourse other than to retreat as fast as they can, because Staff offers little to no survivability for a melee-range engagement. Dagger and Sword have the opposite problem, where if it suddenly becomes prohibitive to maintain melee uptime on an enemy, the Elementalist can do little other than offering some very small token ranged damage while waiting for melee to become a possibility again.
---
My idea is that the UI for the Elementalist would change to something similar to the Revenant's Legend UI. Out of combat, you can choose to spec into any of the four elements, which will determine what your attacks will become.
---
Rather than healing, damage, defense, and CC being split across multiple different elements, you'll have access to all of these things to a certain extent, no matter what element you choose to specialize in, but each element will do it with its own flavor. For example, an Earth-specialized Sage will defend themselves with blocks and barrier. An Air-specialized Sage or Fire-specialized Sage will defend themselves with evasion. A Water-specialized Sage could defend themselves by making enemies miss.
---
In exchange for losing the traditional twenty weaponskills of the base elementalist, the Sage also gains access to a form-swap on the F1 key, similar again to how the Revenant Legend mechanic works. The F1 key will now swap the Elementalist between a Ranged and a Melee form, for a total of 10 skills that are tied to your chosen element.
---
There are still a few problems that would need to be solved for the specialization. The biggest obstacle would be determining how weaponskills would function on each weapon. My idea would be that, for example, if you were a Staff-wielding Water Sage, you would retain all of the water-staff abilities, but they would become more powerful, and you would also obtain five brand new skills.
---
The next biggest obstacle would be trait clarity. For example, how does "Gain Stability when you attune to Earth" work when your character doesn't even know what "Earth" is? Trait descriptions would likely need to be re-imagined in some way. Maybe all on-swap traits would simply always work every time you swap between forms.
---
Finally, the Elementalist would still lack a weaponswap, so compared to other classes, it would still be short on skills, so it would likely have a few more F-key abilities, similar to the Renegade.
---
Anyways, Rangers got their solo Legolas dreams fulfilled in Soulbeast, so if Elementalist could get their mono-element dreams fulfilled as well in some capacity, that would be pretty nice.
---
We figured out that windows defender doing some shit when active. 
---
From crashing DXGI to crashing by itself, generating lags.
---
Any shaders?
---
Got a black lion key today.
---
Opened a chest cause why not?
---
Got a BL statuette.
---
Added it to my other ones.
---
Notice I had fifty.
---
Bought a golden BL key
---
Used it
---
Got the mount.
---
Never gonna use it.
---
But paragon is closer to guardian idk
---
Trampolines don't like players. Period.
---
They've been unreliable since their introduction in Dragon Bash and Not So Secret in 2013.
---
I know it's the best but Razer comes to mind where you save macro keybind
---
No limit. Every run same weight of rewards. I miss this  rewards system actually. Unless it's part of a daily and it'll give u extras
---
The only way they would do this is if they took the glider/packpice approach. Bundle outfit versnion with an armor version and if you have the outfit already you get a discount and ofcourse the bundle is more expensive then a single outfit. 
---
That theyd sell more outfits that players didnt like because of a single pice and they might get their moneys worth for the effort.
---
Not a different dimension. Different planet.

This year I did w2z3 to craft my first weapon after doing w3z1 and w3z2 the first year it came out. However after doing w2z3 I realised I somehow managed to loose the coins from w3z1 and w3z2 throughout the years, probabbly sold them by accident for 16 baubels :-(. So no weapons for me not going for it again.
---
A gs wielding ele, more slow then the piano we have now but more hard hitting.
---
A dual wielding pistol ele sounds cool too though
---
Actually been gone just several months. I guess I never noticed the price increase since I amassed a pretty big amount since launch...I never really open much since I never key farmed.
---
Actually i am not sure if that mount skin is the only reason. I know talwärts 2 ppl who opened each 1k chests Kiste cause of the chaos weapons.
---
Great tips thanks a lot!
---
Not sure about traps, but dual pistol ele is my dream. SpellSlinger!
---
Thanks for sharing ! It can be useful this way too
---
Great Idea! I'll have fun doing that:)
---
Thanks!
---
Yes, I love how much might I can apply with soulbeast on my entire group.
---
Oh I learned something here thx
---
Ok thanks!
---
The base game is free to play already and the expansions are discounted very frequently, is my guess.
---
Yes, more info would be great. This sounds like a good time.
---
I would kill to get this feature...
---
Toxic
---
/u/AnetHoGM since the OP seems to be an advertiser themselves (without declaring it, which may be illegal depending on region) can you provide us with closeups of the posters, I am curious to what they actually say.
---
You can't destroy fire with fire
---
Nobody suggested lv80 booster or Tomes? (Or you want to physically earn the levels?)
---
Yeaaaaap... all the time...
---
I mean i get 2k gems for €17 outside the game, ingame prices are bad.
---
Simple question, simple answer :)
---
Fucking hell....why do they keep trying to push real people into their ads? It's a fucking MMO, make it CGI cinematics of the actual game or some in-game cinematics not this trying to be weird for the sake of weirdness.
---
It has been like this since rune and sigil rework.
---
Same here. Was not the case some weeks ago.
---
Selling jumping puzzles is a game mode
---
Stupid fucking mistakes, man.
---
For what it's worth, mesmers can't take the role of healer. They have some party heals but not strong enough to fit into that spot.
---
And even if their sustained power damage is great, they have a slower burst compared to other power dps classes.
---
What you said is still true, mesmers are great.
---
do be honest i wouldn't play chrono anymore esp. with pugs, going with firebrand/renegade is not only much easier they also provide better utility/heal and pugs doint require stacking on your wells

If you compare other pairs of legendaries, there's a pretty big difference in the themes and styles. Lore-related book shield versus Quaggan shield, clown pistol versus laser pistol, discoball mace versus volcano mace, etc.  Different generations of the same legendary weapon often have different combinations of special effects as well (whether or not they have draw animations, arm/full body auras, trails, footfalls, projectile effects, sounds, etc., and what forms these animations take).
---
Both shortbows are animal themed, have their respective animal appear when the bow is drawn, they fire animated animal projectiles with related animal sounds, have animal-print footfalls, have glowing arm auras and a trail that follows the bow.  While the tiger and unicorn are obviously very different colors, they're both still animals and possess very similar animations and effects. It's not like there's a unicorn bow and an Asuran-themed high-tech compound bow with sleek metal and glowing lights, or a unicorn bow and dark eldritch horror bow that drips and crawls with ghastly horrors, or a unicorn bow and a natural/earthy bow with Sylvari or Norn-related influences.
---
Wiki said 20% so I was like wow that's too much.
---
Yeah, it seems like sort of the Magic the Gathering "planes = planets" deal, with the Mists just being breathable space and also the afterlife. XD My point remains.
---
Durmand Priory HQ in Shiverpeaks.
---
Honestly, this could be one of the more dangerous foes to face. I don't have a complete understanding of all the lore, but this is my thinking.
---
Consider how exhausted the Pact is. And the world's military forces, too. Years of disaster after disaster, fighting a constant stream of dragon minions, fighting civil wars, fighting an unending stream of ghosts - the list of disasters goes on. How many young military age men and women are even left at this point? How much of a generation has been butchered, and how long will it be until we can start to see population recovery?
---
A big bad is scary. The dragons are localized natural disasters. But the key word is localized: the trick to not dying is avoiding them. Easier said than done, but not impossible - though it might be impossible now that Kralk is frolicking in the Mists. In that case, whether or not you bite is a matter of luck. Because apparently, life can survive a dragon rise. Just not much life. After all, the dragons are only hungry for magic. They kill until they are full, and they kill no more. They are an existential threat, but they are not certain death for *everyone*.
---
So consider, after all the destruction that has been wrought up until now, what would it mean to go up against a unified, disciplined, well ordered, and resource rich foe with a functioning wartime industry, a foe bent on waging a campaign of extermination? That strikes me as *at least* as dangerous as Kralk. Spooky as Kralk is, he just wants his hunger sated. If you can't beat him, you can at least try to run. He's got plenty of easy and sedentary prey. But you can't escape from a foe that will hunt you to the ends of the earth. One day, they will find you, and you will have to fight. Despite being less powerful, such a foe could in fact be a greater existential threat than the dragons, because said foe is bent on your annihilation. Kralk doesn't care if you live or die. Kralk only cares about getting his fill of magic.
---
Besides the fact that Tyria is pretty much in shambles, a massive and well coordinated invasion is also a much more difficult problem for the Commander to solve. A dragon or a god are still a single entity. But how does a single person kill an entire nation? I suppose there are ways canonically - the Searing of Ascalon, or the Elder Scroll that sunk Orr. But is that sort of indiscriminate killing really something we want on our conscience? If we wanted to be more surgical about it, sure, we can go after their leaders and fracture the chain of command, but that doesn't kill the ideology and culture that unites them and drives them forward. A new one will emerge in time. Any war of meaningful scale, a war without a big bad that the commander can kill to easily end the conflict - that's not a war that the commander is equipped to fight. Nor is Tyria - at least using conventional means.
---
Honestly, that could be an interesting premise for a deconstruction type story. The hero, used to slaying the big bad and saving the day, gets thrust into a complex conflict of scale, where easy answers are much harder to find. However, deconstructions are getting kind of tiresome, and high fantasy is too easy of a target - it's high fantasy for a reason. So I'd really have to see how well the idea was executed.
---
Over the last year/since PoF I have tried doing some T4 fractals with my main (chrono, i dont enjoy any other class tbh) it was fine untill somewhere after halloween
---
Ever since that time, i tried 3 T4s (no friends/static so i pug it all)
---
Every time they ‘expect’ me to do/know all the portal skips, and perform them flawlessly
---
They dont even ask me if i know them and randomly just /gg themselves
---
It bothers me so much that even random PUGs are so entitled that they expect everyone is a pro
---
I play fractals because i like the content, I dont care about it taking 40 minutes or 2hours, i just wanna do some stuff
---
Play D/P run around queensdale and kill all yellow mobs. Use all exp buffs u can get.
---
Did that once and had about 10 houers for 80.
---
run out?
---
Idk if your dps players just auto attk but my groups just burst it in 10-15 sec max
---
Mesmer probably has the highest amount of roles where it's extremely good, but there are some things they can't do.
---
The class that can do everything respectably OK, I'd say guardian.
---
Great power dps
---
Good condi dps
---
Great healer
---
Good support with quickness and defensive boons
---
Great utility
---
Great for blobs
---
Good in spvp
---
Rangers also can do all that but they aren't very useful in blobs, that's their only drawback.
---
Thanks for sharing this and explaining everything so clearly. I'm with you buddy. I don't see the need to share low effort achievements in the global reddit. Gw2 forums is a perfect place for that. But that's just my opinion.
---
If you are on EU, I help out with a 'newbie friendly' Tequatl run from Tuesday till Sunday at 20:30 CEST. The map chat gives directions and the commanders also give direct guidance to their role zerg/defense.
---
After Teq the gathering starts for Triple Trouble.  I'm part of the Triple Trouble team(speak). We organise 2/3 runs a day at 14:30 and 22:00 with sometimes the dinner run at 18:00. Gathering starts at least 30 minutes before the spawn.  You can join us on Teamspeak at ts3.gw2ttt.com (no need to talk if you are shy, but feel free to do so!) Or keep the LFG in check at world bosses starting with 'Org TT | ts3.gw2ttt.com  | *insert head*
---
No this time I want to learn the profession
---
Lol true
---
Also it gets rid of the game's ugly default bloom.
---
That's my middle name
---
There's a group organising TT at discord.gg/KAav7ka (EU). You can also just check LFG half an hour before it starts and see if there are any groups.
---
I know it's easier said than done, but I'd strongly recommend getting into CMs to you. Competent groups clear CMs+T4 in less than an hour and those pain points you listed are rarely more than an annoyance (fuck ice elemental though).  
---
If you have a good group comp and everyone knows what they are doing, you can just burst a lot of stuff down before it becomes an issue. Subject 6 is a prime example for that, as you can just kill it before the big oozes even reach the middle.
---
Staff's necro's been meta in PvP for like 90% of Gw2's lifespan
---
You can use a portal, but it's also possible to just run as a group (with or without stealth), burst the Elite at the bridge down and move on before all the trash mobs you just skipped arrive.
---
Besides, graphical options are not that demanding in GW2 if you have a decent enough GC. The engine is just rusty af.
---
First time is allways very painful, later it's much easier (but still cancer ofc).  
---
Did you use TaCo overlay? The updated one on reddit is very nice. It shows where exactly to go, when to dodge jump etc.
---
Teq don't need organzied groups anymore it was dumbed down long time ago and also the power creep from all the elite specs and the fact that you can pull mobs together with with mounts just makes it a fast fight. Still above avrage world bosses but you can just use the lfg-tool when it starts and move there. But i usually don't even do that, i just join the map check so we have people enough on the spot and then we go.
---
TT still the only world boss in core game that need to be organized.
---
I miss the days when world bosses was harder and needed group organizations :(
---
Sweet dreams are made of these, who am I to disagree......
---
I'm sure damage nerfs were a part of it but the one that makes it feel completely trash tier was when they increased the cooldown because of Alacrity... A BUFF THE ELEMENTALIST HAS ZERO NATURAL ACCESS TOO.  
---
Mesmer's broken OP shit got Ele staff (and likely other Ele weapons too) nerfed into the the crap heap. W.T.F.
---
Wow I had pretty similar ideas except the warrior xD
---
Thanks, I was considering whether I wanted to throw myself at it during this last week. Maybe I'll give W1 a go. :')
---
404 punchline not found
---
Yep, you technically can get everything for the collection in one day. That's what I did with W1, but W2's levels are so much longer and more difficult than W1's that... yeah.
---
They already have many animations for them on NPCs... Especially in the Lake Dorric area.  And not just the watchknights, some human Seraph NPCs too.  
---
While that is far from being fleshed out, the main thrust is that a lot of the groundwork work appears to already be in place.
---
Wow then you have a lot of things to do :P
---
2 expansions, 2 living world seasons, mastereies for glinding and mounts (this will probably take the longest), 2 new elite specs for each profession, one new profession the Revenant, tons of new maps, meta events in HoT maps, tons of solo things to do and bounties in the PoF maps, collections, stories and more. 
---
Damn as a veteran who done it all and then some i suddenly felt sad that i am not in your position :D
---
Raids, the entire living world season 3, the full expansion Path of Fire, almost the entire living world season 4, many balance patches and major changes. You can see the [major releases here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release#Post_Heart_of_Thorns), [feature releases above here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release/Features#Super_Adventure_Festival_2016), an [infographic on changes since release](http://www.nojamtoday.com/upload/guild_wars_2_content_and_feature_update_chart_290.png) (1 year old now so it is missing post PoF content including season 4). I mean there is really too much to go over in detail but the [PoF expansion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2:_Path_of_Fire) added a lot of content by itself including new elite specs and mounts. If you wanted specifics can give details as well.
---
I suppose by creating a circle of pre-burned forest it will reduce the chances of the main burn to spread. But you still can't distinguish fire with fire, like you can with water. :)
---
Last time before this year that I've played SAB was in its second year of existence.
---
Of the ones you listed, the only one I didn't remember when encountering it this year (with an attitude of "wait THIS is still a thing") is the health 0 but still alive bug.
---
&gt; They do, it just counts the moment you pick it up
---
Does this mean you can pickup-drop over and over?
---
Kerrigan from StarCraft comes to invade.
---
I don’t really get why people have the infinity coin, I find it a bit waste of gold seeing as you can get through the zones with just 10 continue coins anyways.
---
Would *immediately* cash in a 80 boost on whatever profession got this.
---
Very few skins are from the store compared to how many you can get from the game. Skins from the store is also not really that fun to use since so many others using the same look. Better to go to the bank wardrobe and check out what pieces you like and then writhe /wiki nameofpiece in map chat and you get a window open telling you were to find it. 
---
Some things are easy to get, others will take longer and some are a plain grind and might be in a game mode you have not played yet. So be ready for everything :)
---
Tank warrior
---
Commander guardian, general maybe
---
Fractal thing revenant
---
Rifle ranger with 2 pets
---
Mists thing thief shadowdancer or some shit
---
Flying engie
---
Vampire necro
---
Some jack of all trade ele
---
Alternate universe mesmer
---
&gt; Drum Major - Staff Warrior Supporter
---
Only if they get a skill of some sort called *"Is Your Band Ready?"*. :P
---
CMs + T4s in 40min is ... hrrr not even close. You will need about 30min for T4s (usually) and about 20min for recs.
---
In best cases you're done after 40min with T4s and recs.
---
With CMs you can add about another 30min tbh, at least if you pug.
---
&gt; Better to go to the bank wardrobe and check out what pieces you like and then writhe /wiki nameofpiece in chatbox and you get a window open telling you were to find it.
---
I had no idea this was a thing!  Thank you :D
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Reasons many of us don't buy outfits c:
---
Yeah. People prefer mix and match over tons of outfits.
---
So, more like the GW1 necro?
---
there's a difference between what CAN happen and what actually DOES happen
---
We pug 1-2 people usually and it's happened so many times where a thief or a necro joins, doesn't like kp and when we ask for kp, they rely with "what is kp". Reading is hard
---
i love the different ways people express their hatred for this, even though it's not that bad x)
---
Rifle for Ranger.
---
Not really dumbed down, just the majority of community already knows what to do. Also the megaservers allow to make really full maps for it, so there is just too many players to fail it. 
---
However if you come late into some overflow instance, you will have pretty low chance to kill it, as this overflow instance won't have numbers. Pretty ideal time to actually see the fail animations, that are cool as well :)
---
Yup, I use Gw2 Hook with my own Shaderpack to make it look like that 🙂
---
there is a lfg system and there is a section for each individual dungeon.
---
Just be sure to add a description on what youre looking for as a group.
---
The minimal thing to add is which path you wanna do, in which case people will assume you did the dungeons before and expect you to form a speed clear dungeon team
---
* OP complains about pick up Fractals : Pass the moderator
---
* I complains about pick up raiding : Post get deleted
---
[Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/) is still the go to source for raid builds and guides. They updated the benchmarks and builds recently for the last patch too, just some minor cleanup in the guides left from the 3/5/19 patch.
---
Thanks snowflake and etheri, i laughed a lot. But tell me etheri, is this even fun? This guy is just somewhere else. Lol
---
It should be; you can check metabattle as well to see if there are any differences. Snowcrows at least mentions when the last update was for their builds, so it should give you a picture as to how up to date it is.
---
Could also be one of those situations where the cult/fanatics followed 6 people perceived as crazy who were actually gods and followed them to a new world.
---
Have you done it in normal mode / not infantile? Also make sure you wait after the boss/ chest to be ported to the next zone
---
https://www.gw2tp.com/item/20316-black-lion-chest?full=1
---
There ya go.
---
It wasnt till 2018 when the rework of chests (drops) got updated that the price went above 1 silver.
---
Ever since its been going up, with spikes whenever they add a special unique reward
---
The main problem is people not capable of using my wells well, how am i supposed to boon ya if you dont take them
---
Well honestly bought 25 keys via gold and was thinking.. if I didn't get the bird, I'd at least get zephiras rifle via statuettes. Lucky draw, I got both and more.
---
I'm one of those that will never buy the 2k for 1 skin. Only 1600 for 5 (or 8 now idk). I know best not to spend on something like keys cuz content usually stale for 2 months after something new and it slows down again. ~2 mo x 5 weeks x 2 keys = 20 keys. Whatever I gold I earn throughout each week, I convert to gems cuz I don't have use for gold anymore.
---
eso necromancer is going to function pretty much exactly like you described when it comes out
---
Well, not entirely. The Mists is the entire multiverse. Multiverse as in both other planets as well as alternate dimensions/realities. There are at least three canonical Tyrias in existence (thus, three parallel universes that are similar but with some differences).
---
Thus, there are planets which are within the same dimension as Tyria, but also planets in other dimensions/universes/realities (depending on your vocabulary of choice since, fundamentally, the three function the same).
---
Damn, enjoyment is very subjective.
---
Those interested with cinematography: replay with multiple toons to relive the story by feeling through the script, camera angles, coding, music, sfx, voice overs, animations and earn the cheevos and rewards while you're at it.
---
Some just want the new skins, so they plan out the most time efficient way to get all the mats to craft ALL new available skins. Quest is not over until the last skin. We call them "skin whores" like myself.
---
Some are just for the new blip. Hearts, check. Story, check. Grinding for 1 skin, check. Map completion, check. Ok I'm done, see you in 3 months ciao~ usually with limited time, I don't blame them, this is all they need.
---
One thing for sure is you shouldn't force yourself to sit and look for fun with a game you had enough fun already. Should come naturally what you want to accomplish if youre not new with anets content model.
---
What I usually do is grind out the cheevos and ask guildies if they need help with anything. We get on discord chat and go oldskool coop rpg. Talk and play and it's different experience for me at least to play the story alone vs with friends. Alone = goal oriented and with people = lax and chat.
---
Peacock didn't open my wallet but hummingbird did
---
Quick update because you're still telling others how they should lead while having next to no insight on how to lead or play wvw on the forums...
---
I get that this stuff makes you SAD, but the reality is that players like you FORCE players like me to kick you from squads, and to some extent even be toxic towards you.
---
After all, politely asking falls on deaf ears and is simply met with continuing to do what you feel like.
---
While I understand this probably wont make sense to you, it is the reality of the matter and the evolution of wvw across EU and NA.
---
Unrelated
---
http://www.gamergivingback.com
---
There is more information here.
---
&gt; I was around for that and saw no mention of it.
---
They didn’t mention it until the last 2 or so hours and they played it right after the 65k was hit on the stream.
---
Wow thats a really old bug. It still works haha
---
Snowcrows and Discretize will be updated long before metabattles. I would not bother with metabattles for Fractals/Raids builds.
---
I don't know? Maybe because my comment didn't add to the conversation, I just commented that because I had some genuine discussions with people about wether GW2 was a pretty game or not.
---
If you're in NA there's this guy Osano that runs it very frequently on one of his numerous accounts. Very fast and smooth trains.
---
Portals should not even have existed in the first place.
---
I second this, call it gladiator and make it summon weapons like the guardian's spirit weapons
---
Simple "i won't" would be enough.
---
dual pistol warrior where his 4 skill is a bouncing projectile where he throws his pistol and has a second activation where he gets mad if the enemy doesn't give it back
---
If there was, it should have to be nerfed again and again until it's put in line with the rest.
---
And people would complain about it over and over as if it was the end of the world, when it's just a logical and fair rebalance.
---
Seriously. Stop being so rude guys! It was just an innocent question!
---
Well
---
With the new direction the company has taken everything is possible.
---
Count me in
---
Since you probably have a GW account before the changes and upgrades, the NC Soft/ArenaNet issues may arise.  The wording on the site is wrong (slightly) to fix it (mine was for error 1038), but ChronosDage and Thehotrepublic may have hit it, or hopefully this helps. 
---
 
---
To fix it, create a new account with a new email/password and use that one to link to the old one.  You can't reuse your existing email.  The old login on ArenaNet's site won't have a link option (at least mine didn't) like the new one.  I used my old GW email and password and now I can log back into GW and GW2 with the new GW2 info.  You can see the new account lets you go to the "Game Content" tab and download the client as well as the link option.  If you use the old one it leads to a 404 page and no link option.
---
Is there a list of all of the ascended rings and the name of the stats they give? I have so many rings from fractals and want to salvage them, but I can't tell what stat names they have (i.e. it does not say Minstrels, Zerker, etc..)
---
"Step forth, representative of humanity and I will take you to a safe haven where the very best of your race will be given a haven and a chance to start over. No, not you- obviously, the human female with side-boob standing behind you, and that human female there with all the infusions." - The gods, probably.
---
Charr don't use magic in their technology.
---
But ignoring that, the implication given from what little we know about the human homeworld is that it... may no longer exist. Even if it did, how could a group that doesn't know any magic create a portal to access Tyria? It would be beyond jarring to see spaceships coming down out of the stratosphere.
---
&gt; So gw2 should only stand for players like you, who do whatever they wish? 
---
Not at all. Have you actually been reading my post? It *does not matter what I do.* The behavior of players is *irrelevant.*
---
Blahblahblah where is it, where... ah.
---
&gt;Snowflakes force us to be toxic towards them because simply saying sorry, this raid isn't for you if you arent willing or able to adapt isn't respected. 
---
* picking the profession and build you like does not make you a snowflake
---
* picking a build you like is not a sign of disrespect
---
* discussing *off game* that your (or rather in this case my) choice of profession and build puts you at a disatvantage is not a sign of disrespect either
---
* attacking a commander in game, undermining their authority would be a sign of disrespect
---
* discussing a certain choice in game from either side is not a sign of disrespect, though it might be bad style as thing escalate easily from there.
---
You seem to assume that there is such a thing as *right* to some kind of *higher level of gameplay* (which I doubt does exist in the first place). I doubt such a right exist. This sounds like entitlement to me, much more than the right to pick the profession / build you like and expect to be included in the group experience.  
---
Sadly and ironically, a *right* to be included into a squad likewise doesn't exist. But discussing the result of that and the result of effectively being excluded from the gameplay is not the same thing. 
---
We're talking about an MMO, so the expectation of being *excluded* is naturally gonna raise a few more eyebrows than the expecation of being *included.*
---
My first run last year was 4hours as well. Did 3 runs last year and going for the 13 other coins this year. First run was 1h30 2nd run 53 mins. Now constantly between 30-40. 5 to go!!!  It really gets eas... faster when repeating.
---
A proper Dark Mage spec.
---
carry it the other way around and it becomes a super long rapiere
---
oof. now you listed those things i'm kinda hyped :)  
---
still need to actually get those two expansions and bunch of gems to get through living story. 
---
Any advice about what i should focus on for my warrior?(probably getting full set of ascended gear)
---
Yeah, you don't have to wait an hour. Just 10 minutes. 
---
If you do the rift and get ported back, it’s usually because you entered the map after it already started, either by being ported or manually going there.
---
All you do is go back and redo it in 10 mins.
---
I still miss the ability to fully customise the UI like in GW1
---
I only have issues with it when I'm trying to load it in a busy area. No issue in quiet zones.
---
Eh?
---
Why assume that it was in a closed lobby of friends? It is not like you get instantly suspended.
---
One of the "friends" reported you.
---
I just finished leveling my engineer. I'd like to make a raid build for it, but I also frequent open world content. I don't think that I want to get two sets of gear for this character yet. I'm torn between heal scrapper and condition holosmith. I've only been raiding for about three weeks. Throughout this time, I've been a healer druid one-trick, switching to condition mirage when absolutely necessary.
---
Heal scrapper is universally okay or meh for raids but it would obviously struggle with solo play in open world content. Since I power-leveled the character, I can't simply use my current equipment for the times in which I play open world content.
---
Condition holosmith is great for over half of raid encounters and is serviceable for open world content. However, it has a steep learning curve. Relearning the support chrono rotation and finishing learning the power weaver rotation are already on my to-do list. Learning this rotation would have lower priority.
---
I'm interested in heal scrapper because there's almost always another healer druid in my raid squads, which I often find annoying due to the need to balance spirits (unless we just say, “Fuck it,” and stack them). But I've also been considering building a heal scourge, since in the training raids that I frequent, players often make fatal mistakes.
---
I'm interested in condition holosmith because it's great for over half of raid encounters and is still enjoyable in the open-world. Additionally, I'd like to have another DPS build for raiding. I have a condi mirage and a power banner slave warrior, but I'm just meh at those.
---
**TLDR**: I want to gear my new engineer for exactly one raid build. Which of the following should I build: heal scrapper or condition holosmith?
---
do we get one of those dev slapdowns in this thread? by god i hope so
---
I asked what the reason was for my suspension and he showed me the lines, which showed me the lines i said to 1 of my friends.
---
You really don't need to be there very long before Teq starts.  The last 2 times I have done Teq I showed up 5 minutes and 2 minutes before it started and we cleared it easy.  It was at reset so lots of people are doing the same thing and showing up right when it is about to start.
---
Astounding that you really took the time to make a fake picture.
---
'cause otherwise op got no case.
---
Returning player here. Going to be playing tomorrow. Last time I played was back when path of fire came out, I played around November - December 2017.
---
Is silverwastes still considered one of the best farming methods for money? Or has something better come along? If not, anything changed with SW or is the same as ever?
---
Using [X-Mouse](https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/xmousebuttoncontrol.htm), you could assign your weapon swap key to your mouse profile swap key so that they are both activated simultaneously.
---
That said, I agree with others that this will likely make things more confusing for you, not less. There are many situations in game where your weapon skills are automatically replaced by other skills, and having multiple keybind sets for these will be tricky to say the least.
---
That's exactly how gw1 necro functioned. You had to kill enemies, and then spawn your minions off of their bodies
---
Very likely, 1 of the guys tilts easily and after he gets beaten in a 1v1 he always BMs 1 way or another. But even if that’s the case I got all of em to make a ticket regarding the issue to explain the situation but the GM’s simply told them to take a hike lol. “ you cannot assist other players” what a joke
---
That's because when you open the Trading Post, *it opens a web browser* inside your Guild Wars 2. The trading post is its own separate application and so will require extra RAM and CPU usage.
---
What is “feg”?
---
Yeah the first few times I did Trib blind I went through tons, but after a bunch of times doesn’t really take that much
---
This concept is really similar to bravely default and, most, bravely second! Loved it
---
Apperantly the most offensive thing imaginable
---
For me is slow since launch, because of this i avoid sell itens.
---
Had the same problem until I changed my internet provider
---
PvE raid armour, specifically the medium set
---
Let me make a Revenant that attunes to Snaff's Legendary Golemancer stance, providing high power damage and defensive warding summons that function somewhere in between Renegade Warband members and Ranger Spirits.
---
In shortest form possible (pretty sure I didn't miss anything):
---
Armor and weapon skins you can acquire during regular gameplay in form of dropped items, bought stuff from hearth and other vendors or as direct skins rewards from achievements, crafting (regular and mystic forge). Then there are skins available via Black Lion Claim Ticket system you can buy with hoarded ticket (and ticket scraps) or with gold via Trading Post. 
---
Salvaging an item or right clicking and picking "add to wardrobe" option unlocks skin piece on your account. 
---
Applying single skin onto equipped armor or weapons costs you 1 [transmutation charge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Transmutation_Charge), unless skin exist as an item in your inventory or is a part of achievement points rewards - in this case transmutation charge isn't used. Each armor piece may provide up to 4 dye slots. You can't apply skin of different armor type (heavy skin piece won't work on worn mid or light gear) or certain racial skins (norn won't use human, charr, asura or sylvari armor skins and so on; race themed weapons are excluded of this and can be freely applied). You can apply expensive legendary weapon skins on lv1 gear and other way around. Using Mystic Forge in stats changing procedure of ascended tier gear resets item skin to the default skin. 
---
2. Outfits - which are one-piece costumes you can buy mainly thru gemstore or Black Lion Statuettes; there are some old outfits remaining on trading post. Outfits are standardized across all classes but may look different depending on gender and race. To wear outfit you need to select one you unlocked and tick V mark in the slot corner - it doesn't costs you anything to do that. Each outfit may have also up to 4 dye slot. Regular helmet slot visibility (V mark again in equipment section of hero panel) is linked with outfit head garment; on the other hand, shoulders and gloves aren't.
---
No they’re not. This post has literally nothing to do with requiem armor. The post is trying to say more armor sets on the Store rather than outfits, Anet Isn’t listening already.
---
I can see your point of view but, as an owner of the infinite coin, this is almost 100% a convenience item. 
---
Once, you learn W1Z1 on tribulation mode, lives are easy to get/farm when you are getting 250 + baubles per run for 2-3 deaths.
---
After nearly completing both collections, it takes a couple days to deplete my coin use, 99 lives, after doing a full fun of W1 &amp; W2 daily, making quite a few mistakes as I watch youtube while doing it.
---
Pay2win suggests a hard wall that is hard to overcome if not paying but that wall here is skill/experience.
---
Has anyone tested if male and female characters have the same size range? I.e. is a max hight female norn the same size as a max hight male norn?
---
Fair enough.
---
Still quite irrelevant though, the rules applies in all parts of the game, regardless if it is just you and your friends there or if there are 50 other people around. If you want to behave like little kids, do it outside of the game.
---
Hey, I'm not banned... because I never post there...
---
This is why we can't have nice things
---
Yes. No one wants trash outfits when we could wait longer and get a good armor set

*reads the involved main tickets*
---
*closes duplicate tickets on the matter, as answers have been given* 
---
Everyone, please don't try to send more tickets in about the same issue. Especially if you have already gotten an answer previously. More tickets simply means bogging down the ticket system and can actually lead to you being excluded from ticket submissions. Thanks!
---
As for the offence, I'll be happy to give more info, as you have forgotten a few things. 
---
You've not gotten banned based on "feg", as you put it. You have, however, gotten suspended for racially charged comments, homophobic language, and telling other players to kill themselves. If you have forgotten these bits, they were sent to you by the team, both in the ticket created / email sent the first time you were suspended, as well as in the answer to your appeal.
---
"KYS" gets treated as a real-life threat by us, as it only takes one person who is in a bad place already to get that one final push... and a life could be lost. We have no tolerance for it. It's not needed, ever, to tell another human being to end their live. It is not funny, it is not something to just casually throw at people, and if found / reported to us, we will absolutely action it.

Before using popular reddit lingo you should google what it means.

so im working towards getting the mark Y golem backpiece, im on the last collection and found out i need to do the serpents ire meta event. does anyone actually do that event still? if so how can i find them? any specific time of day or a specific day? 
---
im on eu if that matters
---
That's not how it works.
---
If you say such things anywhere aside from whispers, party, and squad chat (where it is ONLY and ALL friends), you risk penalty (depending on what it was).
---
If you have not, then one (or more) of your "friends" is not the friend you think they are.
---
No, you didn't. You get suspended because you broke the rules. Accept it and move on. They can report you however much they want, but unless you have actually broken the rules you will not get suspended (especially not for a full week for a, as you claim, first offense)
---
This will cause issues because "weapon swap" key is also "drop bundle"
---
Or others can stop being moral busybodies and understand that not everybody falls apart at the mention of a \*gasp\* unpure word. Not everyone is a puritan.  Most of us can take a "you're a fucking cunt" from our friends without bursting into tears.
---
Thank you so much for this.
---
[you're in luck!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bbzzcz/banned_for_toxic_behaviour_in_a_closed_lobby_of/ekmr88i/)
---
Or use some classics: Bozo, dingus, yo-yo. Those are the ones that really hurt.
---
Like the good obedient children you are. No need to have thoughts about morality, better let the grown-ups decide for you.
---
But that doesnt mater at all. You were rude and they reported you. You have the ban for a reason. And to be honest, when you admited that you asked friends to spam support for more tickets, your ban should be even longer. The rules are there for a reason and it doesnt mater if you will do it to someone you never seen before or to your friends. Dont take me wrong even I break the rules more often then I would want. So you wouldnt be the first one who did it and you will probably not be the last. Be glad that you were banned just for 7 days and not more.
---
&lt;3
---
And you are of course free to say things like that all you want. But when you are using a service you abide but the rules of that service, otherwise action might be taken against you. It is of course also worth pointing out that, as is often the case in these threads, the GMs actually came here and explained that the OP was clearly omitting details of the situation.
---
It's been that way since we got build templates. Oh wait.
---
Not to mention most of its builds are fairly easy to play in PvE, IMO. Much more so than something like Mesmer.
---
It's mostly about what you want to run.   
---
The probability of getting shit teammates is much higher in a 't4 all welcome' than in 'CMs+T4+Recs|250kp+|Chrono, slb, bs, dps'
---
Thing is having a system for keybinds is way better!
---
In WoW its best to norm your keyboard. Have core  defensive cooldowns on the same key, all your Interrups or CC on other keys across your classes too. Have your burst cooldowns makro'd together so you allways intrinsically know what to press in what situation across all of your classes.
---
So to speak you train into a muscle memory wich leads to several classes not just one.
---
If you achieve that you subconciously can ajust to situations because you exactly know what to do on your main, and since your twinks/alts are normed after your mains keybinds you can react just as fast if not faster in some cases(ranged interrupts) on your alts compared to your main.
---
This makes learing new classes easy since your reaction time is just as precise but only your damage skills change slightly etc.
---
In GW2 its not that easy since some classes have weaponkits and others use weaponswitches or different attunements.
---
I guess you can download the Logitech Support if you use a Mouse/Keyboard from them. There you can safe keybinds to sets and can switch those sets arround. I'm using that to change keybinds and have incombat utilities at hand and quickaccess to the tradingpost etc if I need it.
---
Also were just gonna ignore the fact that the dude higher in the post said he was banned for telling people to kill themselves
---
I hope it's there...with a name like War Eternal i think we have to go to the belly of the beast
---
Same, I do get my shitty group once in a while but 80% of the time everything goes smooth.
---
blessed be this day
---
Can we make that a thing? I'd be happy to see PvP match chat logs filled with those for a change.
---
this is great! i was just getting worried about finding people to get the event done with as i just realised it was a requirement
---
As for Thief I'd actually prefer something more support/tank focused. They'd excel in combat by making use of Retaliation, Reflection, and Dazes, and their Heal and/or Elite would allow them to soak/mitigate damage for allies around them. Think Shen from League of Legends a little bit (plus, Greatsword access.)
---
Demon Hunter-esque Necromancer, gaining *either* a Short bow or **duel** Pistol use (Spellbreaker gained access to Daggers in either hand, so...) They'd have a new shroud converting either the Short bow into a single, powerful, mid-range crossbow, or duel hand crossbows that fire rapidly at mid distance if we go with Pistols. The class would focus on DPS and mobility, and possibly introduce Stealth mechanics to the Necromancer as well.
---
Elementalist gains Longbow in an Arcane Archer playstyle, where each spell they cast adds an arrow to their new "quiver" mechanic. The quiver does *not* need the Longbow to be equipped to be filled, as every (duel/offhand) weapon adds a couple arrows on the "5" key/ability, but the Longbow fills the quiver faster and offers better versatility in filling it. The quiver is "loosed" when the Arcane Archer presses F5, and an assortment of arrows based upon the elements used to create them are all fired in a random order at a target, inflicting a stack of Burning per Fire arrow and Bleed per Earth arrow, a second of Chill per Water arrow and Cripple per Air arrow. Utilities would bring Mantras into the Elementalist's arsenal and could also supply arrows for their quiver, giving even more control to stocking the quiver's effects.
---
Guardian gets access to a "frostfire" mechanic (don't really have a name for this class), in an equal and opposite way to how the Weaver has a string of boons applying more boons to themselves (Swiftness/Superspeed grants them Regeneration, Regeneration cleanses a Condition on them sort of deal). Burning targets they damage are inflicted with a second of Chill (internal cooldown is 4 seconds), and every time they inflict Chill the enemy becomes Crippled and Blinded for 4 seconds, too. Utilities would grant some direct Chill access, Frost Aura effect, direct applications of Cripple, and Elite could mass-Freeze/Chill in a cast area, like a remote Reaper or Legendary Assassin Revenant can (though this would not have to be centered on the Guardian.) New weapon would be Sword in offhand.
---
I wish that were technically possible. The difference in the rigs between light/heavy/medium mean it's never going to happen though. ;-;
---
Would you like a leighter?
---
Not really, I don’t get how it’s even relevant what I said to people who were in our discord having a laugh with absolutely 0 malicious intent. I can even get all of them to post on here, not just simply people to back me up but the people who were  there when I spewed these lines, not like it matters because it’s against ToS lol and apperantly all of you have the morale of jesus christ himself.
---
Well dont know about PvP, but we in PvE can make you some reports with these in the chat, if it will make you happy :3
---
It's the rigging- they can produce outfits much faster because they don't have to worry about any seams outside of the head. This is also why you can't mix and match skins from different weights.
---
\*snort\* Offended. Hah, I'm not offended. I have problem with puritans encroaching further and further on the freedom of expression as outlined by the Universal Declaration Of Human Rights, which even has stipulates this should go across all media. More and more we have these moral busybodies trying to police your language and thoughts. It's stupid and can't lead to anything good. Governments and corporations are becoming more and more like overprotective parents which is going to lead to a generation of feebleminded individuals who can't deal with any adversity whatsoever. And when that adversity comes (and it will), then what will happen?
---
Seems like it's called that in pretty much every other western language than English, works in Spanish, Swedish, Finnish, Indonesian etc.
---
Making a single mesh as opposed to five is *way* easier, I don't know what you're on about.
---
&gt; They can't be "cut up" because they are literally a single piece.
---
I would wager that head/gloves/boots might still be separate, or capable of being separated. The chest|leg split is where it gets difficult because the different rigs just aren't compatible there.   
---
I'd have to go hunt it down, but I think there might be one set of individual glove/boot/hat that's also featured in an outfit, which would indicate that *some* split is possible.
---
Same here fam it’s a chill af place during that night xD
---
I believe in some games the enemy cursing has their text replaced with compliments
---
I would hate if someone else got to decide what outfit belonged to what character of mine.
---
I don't think Freedom of expression supports the act of telling people to kill themself, which OP did.
---
Pinapple.
---
So when can we get a finisher this spectacular in the gem store? :P
---
&gt; Sirens Reef i have to change my sword to focus
---
To be fair you should be using focus over sword pretty much 80% of the time. Who is doing the pulls if not you?
---
Guardian has a functioning core Meta Power dps spot with Dragonhunter, and 3 different specs for firebrand (healer healbrand, supporter quickbrand, condi dps firebrand) where arguably cDPS firebrand is the only bursting condition spec there is so it can be brought into fractals and encounter with less bossuptime.
---
Also Guards are not just viable but meta in PvE, sPvP, WvW and open world... there is no mode where you can't bring a guard. Noone will approach a Guard and ask for his legitimacy to join a group where as some other classes will get checked twice.
---
--
---
Mesmer have this benefit too, they can be played in every mode especially all PvP modes (mirage is absolute cancer to play against) and are required in PvE as well!
---
Chrono provide both Alacrity and Quickness and to some degree can be played in combination with every healer class there is, you can adapt to a healbrand / druid / tempest / renegade with ease and especially your adaptable boonsupport is great for pugging.
---
Chrono dps is a solid choice for PvE content and you can bring this into fractals and raids as well. Your damage is huge and can keep up with other classes dps just fine.
---
Mirage in PvE is meta in some raid bossfights, some groups fill with like 6+ Mirages (4- supporter) and clear bosses. Allthough mirage is not really a high bursting class and needs to ramp up damage wich makes it less usefull in fractal CMs etc.
---
I mean, yes, but that's up to the user to manage. Even with the mix/match options we have now, there's a lot of clipping (especially on Charr).
---
You *clearly* have a loose grasp of both freedom of speech and morality if you are genuinely trying to argue this.
---
If they become every dailies they stop being fun though. Especially if say Arah comes up twice in a row.
---
&gt;Just give players the tools to deal with others and let the problem work out itself.
---
Yet there is a tool to report players already.  How do you know it wasn't used in this case?  Maybe it was!  Maybe he got reported amongst his group of friends using this tool because they were also of the attitude that it is "just a joke, bro"?  Mmmm irony.
---
If someone person calls his black friend "mah niggah" is it also racist? No, of course not. Telling your friend to go kill himself isn't serious either.
---
Do you expect someone that poorly tries to mask homophobic remarks ("for fun!") to utilize language correctly?
---
And here I'm just wishing that the old town clothes -&gt; tonics -&gt; Outfits had appropriate dye channels so that they don't look like onesies when they change color...
---
Completely off-topic but: I first read it as "Fresh 80s Mesmer" and now I wanna know what that would look like ...
---
Had this lat year too. Often at the end, but also in the middle. And mostly when a cutscene comes up.
---
Locking FPS worked for me, after trying everything else. Though it may just've been luck in the end.
---
yeh, everything you're doing is cause you're the chosen one who magically bonded to aurene. 
---
exactly the point, you're the one practically doing solo everything and raising yourself from the dead and other bs and at the rate you do it in is too easy. the only thing that's good is the world events in which you're the one who participates in the outside mordremorth fight. Ya, you , the lone adventurer are fighting a literal god whose power rivals the dragons just cause the plot is written by 12 yos. Its a MMORPG in which the MMO is taken out of for a shit story for people that are easily entertained and could be done by simply wigglying your keys in front of their faces.
---
You are definitely right on the head being able to be separated, gloves and boots I suppose is possible, but not universally (think e.g. some of the outfits that change your entire body... like the fiery one I think it was Balthazar but honestly I forget as I don't care much for outfits).
---
So yes, what you say probably applies to many outfits but there also are outfits that are pretty out there :).
---
Ah, trying to belittle me instead of arguing the point. I guess you're all out of legs to stand on, then?
---
You’re all ding dongs and weenies to me
---
At least it's better than thief sword in PvE.
---
I'm curious to know how much effort does it take to, at the very least, cut up some of the pieces into individual parts?
---
I would expect helms to be relatively easy? There are a few outfits where you can get the helm as a separate piece. Also a few examples of shoulders too. How about boots and gloves? My understanding is that chest/legs are the most challenging, but some of the others are simpler, but maybe I'm wrong.
---
I had no issues for a while then for the most of March that wasn’t the case
---
Yes but for trinkets. I want to see which attribute prefixes belong to the rings since they all have unique names and don’t elaborate on stat names
---
It's funny how folks always dive head strong into  "Freedom of Speech."  
---
Maybe should take a look at the agreement they signed again.   
---
Then again, let them scream freedom of speech... It's not freedom of punishment.
---
And now you don’t play at high mmr either. For a week anyway. ;)
---
Check out the first few episodes of WoodenPotatoes GW2 LP.
---
[Official Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page)
---
I think this is really easy to fix because the main issue are numbers. Currently power warrior has an interesting rotation which is much more difficult to design for.
---
They were previously fine in PvE until Anet nerfed peak performance. Rebuff it to maybe 30% in PvE only and we are good to go.
---
GS vs Axe is something I am rather meh about because Axe should outdamage GS as axe is a pure damage weapon while GS has some utility inbuilt. Maybe a tiny bump on whirlwind and hundred blades in PvE only and that's about it. I think this should be held off until seeing how PP buff would work.
---
tl;dr: Rebuff peak performance
---
Just arrived here, and other than a meeting in 20 minutes, I'm good to go to argue you into oblivion if that's what you're after. You have a terrible grasp of the laws surrounding freedom of speech (in the U.S., which I'm fairly confident you probably hail from given your gross lack of understanding of what it truly means) and its extent and limitations, and I'd *happily* provide plenty of evidence that, while it probably won't fix your backward understanding, will at least hopefully show most others here how dumb that argument truly is. Care to continue for a time? Great.
---
Starting with a quick and *very easily done* Google search, we come across this statement and explanation for what freedom of speech is: "Freedom of Speech means that someone's right to say something is protected within certain limits. A person may have to suffer consequences for saying some things, but they still have the right to say them. For example, it is against the law to yell, "FIRE," in a crowded place because someone may get injured." Now, this seems to be from a children's site, but at least children seem capable of understanding this *exceptionally simply* concept! Here's the [source](http://score.rims.k12.ca.us/score_lessons/bill_of_rights/media/press.htm) to this for-children website.
---
So let's look a bit deeper, shall we. Here's the First Amendment verbatim. I don't expect you to remember *elementary school* given your stance up until now, but at one point in time this was hopefully expressed, if not explained correctly, to you: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."
---
Now let's dissect this, shall we? Congress, explicitly, will not make any law "abridging" (meaning "curtail" or "impose restriction on") freedom of speech. Congress, as in governmental bodies, may not make laws that prohibit you from saying something terrible. You can totally say that nasty comment! But...other people don't have to tolerate it, or not retaliate. And that's where you seem held up.
---
Anet as a private company is **not** Congress, so if they said they're banning the word "banana" from the game, tough! They're allowed to ban such a silly word in *their* game/product. You can scream and whine all you want that they suppressed your right to say banana, but in truth they didn't. You're still fully capable and legally allowed to say "banana" on any street you walk, or while at home in the privacy of your basement. Heck, say it on Discord since only Anet/GW have banned use of the word, go hog wild with "banana!"
---
But if you say "banana" at a place of employment where they *also* don't tolerate it, you can't go crying foul play that you were sent home and your job was called into question because you choose to engage with a word you knew they did not tolerate. "But my one friend eats bananas all the time and THEY said I could say banana!" Yeah, no, not how it works. And while the government can't come after you directly for it, someone at work that was offended for your use of "banana" might have a case against you, especially if you called THEM the unsavory word.
---
You see, individuals and private companies are not "congress." You can freely say whatever word you want, but you aren't free from reproach if they aren't happy about it.
---
You can cry "moraility police" or the all-too common "SJW" boogeyman are to blame, but the truth is you had a deeply flawed understanding of your own rights. Now I have a meeting to get to, so I hope you can read through all that by the time I get back :)
---
Maybe a Mesmer that changes players and the physical environment instead of summoning clones?
---
*Hello, ladies, look at your mesmer, now back to me, now back at your mesmer, now back to me. Sadly, he isn’t me, but if he stopped using boring old elite specs and switched to Thaumaturge, he could play like me. Look down, back up, where are you? You’re on a boat with the me your mesmer could play like. What’s in your hand, back at me. I have it, it’s a skritt that's gonna get your booty. Look again, the skritt is now sad Rytlock. Anything is possible when your mesmer is a Thaumaturge. I’m on a moa.*
---
How is it easier? When I'm modeling something it is way easier to model component parts and put them together rather than making everything a single object. Genuinely how is it easier?
---
It is probably impossible, the very reason they do outfits is that they do not need to be compatible piece by piece with other gear, and this streamlines the production process a lot. 
---
However, for each outfit I can easily see one or two pieces being easily separated and compatible with others.  
---
So, a compromise could be that for every outfit you buy you get (1) the Oufit and (2) one or two pieces separated as armor skins. It should be reasonably doable, something people look forward and an incentive to buy the outfits.
---
Also. Asuran females have nice dresses instead of suits. Charr outfits look like they were meant to actually fit a Charr body. and Bubbles was  killed off screen by the Quaggan.
---
I don‘t have it so this might not be very helpful but have you tried removing the dyes on the glider to show the original dyes? 
---
They should have the same look as the backpack
---
Echo mesmer. Shouts, reverberation, and hitting people with a microphone mace.
---
Corsair warrior, to complete the ferocity/dignity/charm trio setup with berserker and spellbreaker. Taunt people and chug beer to heal.
---
Poltergeist necromancer. A stealth and misdirection-based shroud and spoopy spirit weapons.
---
Warden ranger. Instead of going to the past to harness the souls of beasts or the power of druids we use the power of rifle and banners to get people off our lawn. And pet our dog.
---
Famous last words: "Not me!"
---
And they went and post them in a backwater neighbourhood with Liquor Store included? I'm sure the gamers hanging out there are gonna see them.
---
The fact you think it’s okay to say the thing you said even only to friends is just unbelievable tbh.
---
Regions are what matter in PvE. If you're on EU, regardless of which European server, you can join and taxi yourself to a proper map instance without an issue.
---
NVidia Freestyle is very useful, no need to hassle with hooks, shaders etc. If you have nvidia.
---
we aren't talking about government though. you are free to call people slurs but ANET is also free to can your ass if you do. everyone agreed to it when they signed up. frankly, nobody really gives a shit if you disagree.
---
That's how I got the Midnight Sky identified.
---
The two dye channels on the glider are the rings around the intakes (Midnight Sky) and the color of the exhaust.  The one I'm looking for is the body of the glider/backpack.
---
Did you click the "Digital Download" section of the retailer list, they should be listed under there.
---
Do you have any specific issues? What's confusing to you? How to level up the best way? Traversing the game world?
---
I vote ranger. Snipey mcsniper time.
---
My morality is not being an ass to others.  Anet seems to agree on this.  Not like it hurts me to respect the host of the house I visit.  Be trashy in your own yard.  Be trashy in mine, you can leave.  Anet's yard, anet's rules.
---
Hooo boy, Eternity and Ascension? Come back when you've made ascended armor you skrub.

---
If telling people to kill themselves is something you find to be funny, I'd be tired of your shit after several years too.
---
LUL.
---
Likely already has it as you can see clearly.  Little known fact, vaccines cause autism and this guy for sure has it.
---
It is true that large amounts of players left because ANet stopped supporting the game and only game the illusion of doing so; but the game is by no means populated by 80% bots.
---
After getting people to ticket-brigade, it should be a month at minimum. Or, my personal preference, permanent.
---
Approximately 2 years ago i would strongly disagree with you on the 'healer role', because the mantra healing mesmer was a very serious thing.  
---
But now - sadly - i have to agree that with the amount of effort that you would have to put into being a healer on mes, compared to Scrapper, FB, Druid or Elly, is just pointless.
---
Fuk off ary
---
Nice write up! Thanks for posting.
---
&gt; If you have not, then one (or more) of your "friends" is not the friend you think they are.
---
Or maybe they *are* the friend he thinks they are, but they're tired of him using "KYS" as some kind of joke.
---
For example, this is a gallery of all Light Armor sets worn by the most popular character: Human Female:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human\_female\_light\_armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_female_light_armor)   
---
Click on each image or their name to find out about the acquisition method. If your character is one of the other combination, scroll down to the very end of the page and select yours: for example, Medium - Charr male.
---
ok
---
There's multiple skins that resemble your description. For 4 gold on the tp at most. Get them.
---
:’D
---
We don't know that it was that guy, and we don't know that it really was out of spite. Whomever reported him doesn't deserve to have anger and frustration directed towards them when OP made this bed himself.
---
Yeah but why would you even do that?
---
The anger, the rage.. It must be unleashed!

Just checking your negative karma and terrible shit posts from the past make me question humanity.

Tho i did not include engineers since i dont know that much about them.
---
People nowdays usually use only holosmith as a dps option.
---
They buffed up some healing potential with med kit a while ago and gave it some more ways to support but its still not as powerful ,or as easy to pull off as a tempest healer, and druid still offers a lot of group wide offensive support
---
No, he means your first time riding a bike.
---
I cringed so hard reading that mail...
---
Just curious though... what even prompted them to send you this mail? What was the one little thing they made the assumption over?
---
Thanks for the tips!  Gonna try some dungeons tonight.
---
I’m so ready to go back to Cantha. It was my favorite GW1 campaign by far
---
80%? Those are Rookie Numbers
---
Source?
---
I just love the warrior greatsword gameplay. Lately I've been using a mix of Gs and Dagger/axe and it's been a lot of fun for open world. When I hop into fractals I just swap some skills and im gucci
---
I honestly don't think I have seen a single bot in GW2
---
Ary pls, we all know you made that gold by stripping in LA e.e
---
(/s)
---
I hate it and I'm half way done with world 2.
---
This requires a mandatory [mandatory xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1357/)
---
So for every 10 players, 8 are bots....
---
I must also be a bot then
---
This event has no lore relations to anything important in game. It's just a worse version of anomaly rifts.
---
In one of the LS3 story, Rox mentioned that Caudecus retreated to the Isles of Janthir for unknown reasons, so there *should* be something.
---
That’s why I get to tank Chak Gerent when I do the TD meta REeEeEeeEeEeE feelsbotman
---
dw, already started on the ascension.
---
What's the preset you're using? Xd i want to get into hook again but last time it just looked meh to me. I have all settings on max.
---
Glad you're putting him on blast. Screw that guy.
---
Ye, at reset time. However if you don't have the opportunity to do it consistently, it is always advised to arrive there 30 minutes before the boss starts, otherwise you'll end up in a low pop map with people who don't even know what the hylek ballistas are for.
---
I've never encountered a bot in 3000h of game time
---
where is the fourth one in relation to the main map?
---
He's beginning to brand all over the place eith his rifts. Has been since Episode 4 though they're only really showing it with current events now.
---
There weren't crystals that I saw. Just a brandstorm, Shatterer, and rifts. The former two could be due to the Pact's presence, if Kralk is just attacking "the next biggest threat to him" like he did with the Death-Branded Shatterer hunting the Pact airships until finding the Commander and then Aurene.
---
New current event in the 4/9 patch.  that_shaman has a site with times and location: [https://thatshaman.com/tools/rifts/](https://thatshaman.com/tools/rifts/)
---
True though at least it carved out a niche for itself on boon thief.
---
i've completed both collections, and this made me chuckle
---
Dang that's very useful information!
---
How does it work?
---
Fuck it.  Staff is just a giant banner for warrior.  Cut out the middlemen.
---
Well admittedly a good number of Istan population are indeed bots, ones I have been continuously reporting ever since the zone'd launched, no less. Anet could try a little harder at combating those.
---
Thanks for effort .
---
Do any 3 dailies from any category and get 2G. You can mix and match between PvE, PvP, WvW.
---
Spellthief. Main hand focus. Provides boons and healing and would hopefully be far more viable than Fire for Effect Deadeye.
---
its been 2 years since power warrior was remotely close to viable as a dps.  
---
i don't think arena net will change anything. but we can only hope.
---
I am about to go for the first time. I bought the original GW games at christmas ish in the sale, and am not far of finishing prophecies.
---
Answer the question though. Why would you even do that?
---
&gt;which after u get u basically never use any other title
---
LOL
---
I was wondering if it was maybe that title since the guy specifically mentioned 1k gold. That's weird though, I don't know why they even bother :s
---
EVOS starts taxi in lfg at 3:30am server time, most of the roles are filled by guild members (defense squad recruits openly and teaches/has a lot of community vets who may or may not also be in evos - many peeps are in multiple wurm guilds). Our taxi usually runs until :50 when Zerg squads appear and then those list if numbers are low.
---
I never bought one. All i open are free ones
---
Thank you very much but i'm maybe not as awesome as you think... :3 The first run of the "Warm Season", will be ***sunday*** not saturday... I hope you'll be able to join anyway.
---
Are you referring to the actual trading post or the gemstore? I ask because people tend to be glomp things together.
---
I haven't had much issue with the trading post except for some occasional hiccups/pauses but there is definitely an issue with the gemstore section that started happening at around the SAB update. Every time I open the panel the game saturates my downstream.
---
thanks a lot
---
nice thank you
---
I use this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodenPotatoes/comments/6xa734/giveaway_and_megathread_guild_wars_2reshade_30/dmf177w?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) Though I only use the HDR (FakeHDR and P1_HDR), Mode3, Vibrance and Tonemap
---
&gt; That's why so much speculation is focusing on geography, because we don't have enough story threads to determine anyone's intent.
---
I’m sure we have enough lore and background to *at least* propose a few leads as fas as the story is concerned.
---
As for the geography, the only flaw I see with people using the environment of the trailer at face value is Anet’s precedents of not respecting the geography of their own lands entirely. Nobody would have been able to determine the south of Palawan (Cahbek Trust) as part of Istan if we were only shown these bright cliffs in a teaser. Hell even the Astraliun is 90% different.
---
We were shown 10% of the new map and we’re jumping to conclusions.
---
The top three I want are Power-DPS elite specs for **Mesmer**, **Ranger** and **Revenant** using power-focused elite spec weapons.
---
* **Elementalist**: I could see condi-DPS.
---
* **Necromancer**: Maybe support, though Scourge occupies a dual-role for condi-DPS and support. A minion master would be great too for whatever role that'd occupy.
---
* **Engineer**: Heal/support or condi-DPS. I love the idea of a technology-based healer.
---
* **Thief**: Condi-DPS or heal/support.
---
* **Guardian**: Not sure on this one, especially with the versatility of Firebrand. I'm worried this profession will get the "PvP" elite spec next round that isn't very desirable in PvE. I wouldn't mind seeing a "tanky" focused elite spec or maybe even a more in-depth healing role focused on barrier and aegis.
---
* **Warrior**: Power DPS with a power-based weapon since I know a lot of people have wanted that playstyle. I'd also be curious to see what a healer role would look like.
---
Specific professions aside, I'd love some more use for certain weapons. Mace, hammer, scepter, focus and pistol in particular. And you know, land spears wouldn't hurt either.
---
Oof yeah, I read too fast. I can join on sunday! Really appreciate the heads up! :)
---
Agree. Or better yet, just let leaders and commanders to take out siege blueprints. Cuz they're the ones gonna put down the sieges as well.
---
&gt;but ignore that they lose several dps modifiers?
---
in the particular case of core rev you'd run retribution, that traitline has two  easy to upkeep 10% modifiers, basically on par with herald if that's the argument -a very weak and tangential one to begin with- so I don't see what's the issue in stating herald has no burst.
---
You actually create characters for map completion just to delete them later? Gosh,
---
only have 5 char slots :&lt; but i keep a rota going for crafting gen 1s
---
Not spiky enough to be a Choya.
---
This is going to fall on deaf ears (read: the guy you replied to), but i enjoyed it.
---
And this here is where I fail in this game. Fractals and dungeons are all about buff sharing, but to share you gave to all be within 3 feet of each other and the mob. No ranged fighting here like in any other game. With a dozen different colors, shapes and effects happening all at once, I have no chance to find my char. I wish I could turn off all player made ground effects.
---
How hard is minstrel set to get?
---
The story is by far the best of the three campaigns and the missions are so enjoyable. Trust me, you’ll definitely have fun.
---
Only if we can put the pistols on our feet.
---
Warrior Commander - Stuff:
---
*Support focused specialization.
---
*Staff would give small heals and dmg reduction skills.
---
*Base dmg reduction increased when wielding a Stuff. 
---
*Traits focused around Stuff and warhorn.
---
*Dmg mitigating abilities.
---
*elite Special ability that allows Warrior to absorb all the dmg taken by allies in proximity and reduce is by 50%. (Might use other defensive cd to mitigate rest of dmg)
---
*Buffs to banners
---
Could actually make Warrior something more than "banner slave" in pve and bubble guy in wvw. 😁
---
For the current event I only need the iron marches part of the collection. Do I need to go through the whole map cycle to get that or can I just go straight to another map, do the event and take the portal that brings me to iron matches and give item to npc?
---
If you are literally 100 ectoplasm away, that's literally less than 20 gold, which is a few hours of farming *at most*.  You might as well go ahead and finish it, it's one of the nicer looking legendaries IMO.
---
In PvE, Weaver (Elementalist), Melee Deadeye (Thief), and Spellbreaker (Warrior) use dagger in their meta build.
---
No, it isn't. What do you do about the GM's misinterpretations? What's your solution? Why is it okay to ban innocent banter because the mods interpret it differently?
---
Teaching kids gambling was not what was intended by "live service" either, but here we are.
---
Missed those two. But the rest, even far Shiverpeaks, aren't canon.
---
The atrocious grammar and ack of punctuation killed me as if  they were so furious with you existing they didn't have time to type a mail properly
---
It was around the same time they removed the "exploit" of using slingshot dismiss to ignore knockback, probably the year right after Torvagent did his run. 
---
I think there might be a way around those traps somehow still, but I've yet to find one. It'd be nice if someone could find it, I lose time sometimes on dumb mistakes at the lava portion. It's one of those sections that should be easy but lag can screw you up.
---
I have to ask myself sometimes if the people who are so keen to go back to Cantha have played Factions recently and remember how much time you spend in a city that looks like it's made entirely of old cardboard.
---
I'm still hoping for a shield elementalist that drops air and gets wood and metal attunements and is much more control based, rather than damage or support.
---
So because the one thing ended up this certain way, that makes the other thing okay? No, that's not how this works. The way it actually works is that it means we have *two* messes to clean up, not zero.
---
Live free or die.

Is super adventure box worth playing? I'm a fairly casual player. When I play I usually try to do the dailies then I do some story content and some boss events.  Last time I did it probably 2 years ago I didn't have a ton of fun with it anyways but I'm just wondering if it's worth for a casual player like me to do SAB.
---
Thanks that helps
---
IMO, Nightfall had the best story and the most enjoyable gameplay... but factions was just so damn memorable... I buy straight into the factions nostalgia if for no other reason than the Jade Sea.  God I loved the Jade Sea.
---
They're in good hands with Byron.
---
If you only need Iron Marches, you only need to do Iron Marches.
---
What portal you go *In* doesn't matter. You can pick any map. It's what portal you come *out*, which is on a timer. [That_shaman made a nifty tool](https://thatshaman.com/tools/rifts/)
---
Just finish it. Daggers are still used in a lot of meta builds. Having a stat-selectable, free sigil swapping dagger is invaluable.
---
&gt; which after u get u basically never use any other title
---
_Ultimate Dominator_
---
Best title in game.
---
THE DEEP
---
Wasnt there a lil island before the main island on cantha area?
---
I liked nightfall's story more. but cantha will always have a place in my heart because I started GW 4 weeks before factions release.
---
Back off officer. It’s my wife I know she can take a beating. Plus I did it ironically. See?
---
There a middle ground for a reason, language should not be aligned with the puritans nor should it be to the most offensive cunts around there. There’s stuff you say in places and not others, crazy life eh?
---
replied to someone else why i have it. I agree with you, i wouldnt have gotten it either if it was for a dumb deal a year ago haha
---
BLchests? It's been awhile since I've played. I dont remember a lot, lol
---
&gt; We were shown 10% of the new map and we're jumping to conclusions.
---
This isn't a new thing. And frankly, I have way too much fun doing exactly that. I really enjoy all the discussion it brings. I like the satisfaction of having my predictions confirmed, and I like being surprised if I'm dead wrong.
---
&gt; I'm sure we have enough lore and background to *at least* propose a few leads as far as story is concerned.
---
Well certainly we can speculate a ton. But I mean, questions like the one you asked about "*why* would Kralk go to this location in particular?" It's hard to offer explanations beyond the "maybes" I offered previously. Given the death of Aurene and the tone it set, I'm surprised we're still going after Kralk right off the bat. I don't have anything to reinforce those speculations, so that kind of destructive questioning doesn't really lead anywhere.
---
Like, a lot of speculation works in a positive direction. Going based on minimal evidence and just rolling with what tidbits we receive. Your question kind of works in a negative direction, because the answer is almost certainly "I don't know." Unless Kralk went somewhere super identifiable, we can't really speculate on the intent. So right now, we're trying to speculate on the location so we can begin to speculate on the intent. You're skipping ahead, it feels like.
---
And if it is somewhere we've never been before, then we're kind of hitting a wall, because there may be little to no lore for us to work with.
---
&gt; not respecting geography
---
You're right, they do tend to interpret things in a specific way to make things more engaging with modern mechanics. However, I feel they also do a pretty solid job of making things feel familiar as much as they can.
---
&gt; Astralarium is almost completely different
---
It totally is! It's come a long way in 250 years. But it also still uses a lot of design cues and technology from GW1. The mirrors, the telescope obviously depicting it as a way to study the stars, etc. I bet if that had been shown in a teaser before the map was revealed, people would have identified it as the Astralarium very quickly.
---
&gt;Nobody would have been able to determine the south of Palawan (Cahbek Trust) as part of Istan if we were only shown these bright cliffs in a teaser.
---
Probably not, but then again it wasn't a massively influential part of the main story. It was a tutorial instance exclusively for Nightfall characters.
---
Also, it's not like we ONLY saw a single location in these newer videos.
---
We're seeing the cliffs, a large body of water, what appear to be floating islands, Elonian foliage, what appears to be Maguuma-style foliage, ghost bears, Pact tents, Airships, waterfalls, earth elementals, a brandstorm sky, the position of the sun, and different-colored clouds around Kralkatorrik in different shots. It's not much but each little thing *could* lead us somewhere.
---
I mean, when we got the [teaser image](http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gw2-new-raid-wing.jpg) for Hall of Chains, it was super ambiguous, with people bouncing ideas around as to whether that was snow or ash. Shiverpeaks or the Mists? And many people eventually arrived at the conclusion that it was the Underworld, and they were right.
---
Framing "jumping to conclusions" as a negative thing in this context is silly. We know we're jumping to conclusions, but we're having fun with it and seeing just how much we can learn from barely any information.
---
I've had this idea of a greatsword with a ghostly summoned weapon that swings the same time you attack. Think firebrand axe auto, but without the annoying delay
---
You know why someone would report that. This community is one of the softest and perpetually offended groups I've ever seen in an online game. You gotta understand that when dealing with them.
---
When outfits look like armor, there is something wrong with them. Outfits would have been a fine addition to the game if they remained outfits and not armor sets you can't take apart. 
---
Outfits should have remained outfits (or an attire if you want) that does not comply with the traditional Light, medium, heavy armors. Examples of these are the noble count outfit, Cook's outfit, Raiment of the Lich and so on. 
---
Many current outfits can easily be put into one of the armor classes, however, which is a shame.
---
dont go with pugs then ... or at least not with someone who don't even know how their class is supposed to work
---
I know it's likely two different groups that like different things, but it's kinda interesting that PoF did what people complained HoT didn't have and HoT did what people now complain PoF doesn't have.
---
It's as buggy as always, honestly. Nothing has changed.
---
Echovald pissed me off, because you HAD to have a necromancer class or subclass to beat it.  I used to run all sorts of elite areas with exclusively warrior or paragon skills (yellow way!)... an 8 man team of that could really clear some hefty shit.  Running a 12 man team of all warrior/paragon in the Deep is still one of my all time favorite moments in Guildwars.
---
where is that?
---
oh this is just as an alt char, not an alt acc^ usually try to keep 10k in wallet with minimal spending, but recently my tp flips not been going great, so got around 20k stuck on tp on either bids/on items iv listed but have been undercut alot of time
---
If you were to craft it or convert ascended it would be 135g to buy the freshwater pearls alone. Trinkets can be earned with LS3 currency(winterberries are easiest). 
---
Cheaper route:
---
You could earn exotic gearboxes from wvw/pvp and choose minstrel stat. Even living story episodes have achievements and give you access to exotic armor with selectable stats.
---
You shouldn't even reach the big aoe if your dps is decent. If your dps are actually cable of bursting you should be able to skip it
---
"Okay- Zosin -, I will 'harm this man' for you."
---
Using physical skills to me is good burst window rotation. Assassin's signet and physical skill accomplish the exact same purpose in which you want the buff to cover as many high damage skills as possible. If you use a physical skill incorrectly especially if you don't coordinate with berserker's power and magebane tether, then you lose out on dps. That's the trade off to me where you can mistime it. You don't want it to be up when you are using low damage skills. 
---
As for skill utilities, I am pretty sure this is the exact same thing for every other professions as well where you have practically a few skills that do just overshadow literally everything else in terms of damage. I think that's fine because you don't really want to design, well utilities skills to do damage instead of doing utility. 
---
Sure buff signets or stances in PvE, but I don't see how that's going to be much better than what warrior rotation is now. I still think power spellbreaker currently have one of the best and most fluid rotation in the game, it just needs numbers.
---
Lol chat lags, I just got ur msg
---
If you find it fun, play it.   
---
If you don't find it fun, don't play it.
---
The battle islands??  
---
They said that they were sinked when zaithan rise orr.   
---
But maybe they were habited again, or the remains of it. The Zaishen order returned to POF, but from where?, maybe they can be used again to the next episode or season 5.
---
Wasn't HoT Sylvari based?
---
I WANT TO SEE MY BUDDIES IN THE MINES !!!!!!!!!!!!
---
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE THE WONDERS OF THE MORIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ??????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
A necro elite spec that actually is what the devs think it should be on release...
---
;)
---
Yes they are made up name. But doing some digging I found they are made up with from some lore bits:  
---
* Drakkar Summit contains the whole zone of Drakkar Lake (now a sea form The Historical Guide to Tyria from our favorite shaman)
---
* Boreal Chasm comes from the names of the real area (Ice Cliffs Chasm) and the first outpost of GW:EN Boreal Station
---
* Irontoe Ascent is referring to the mini-dungeon (Fronis Irontoe's Lair) where you help  [Kilroy Stonekin](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kilroy_Stonekin) to beat  [Fronis Irontoe](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fronis_Irontoe)
---
Yes, I'm aware.
---
It's been a long time, maybe Cantha has been taken over by Tengu?
---
It might be worth finishing some of the easier achievements. Start on infantile mode and you can already do most of these achievements. 
---
* Finish race in the hub
---
* Finish infantile mode
---
* Collect all the baubles
---
* Collect all furniture coins
---
* Find all secret areas
---
* Collect the item upgrades in quests
---
If you still have appetite for more, then:
---
* Finish on normal mode
---
Cantha and Blood Legion Homelands: Why only want to see the GW1 areas? There is so much more to explore, but you nly want to see those maps we already have in GW1?
---
That's one way. You still need volunteers for the boss fight before that (that's usually where I have issues), and it might take more tries, so your volunteers either need to stay for the entire time, or you need new ones all the time.
---
This is like the kindest mean message ever, he even offered you help.
---
Okay I got a laugh 😂😂😂
---
I get your point, but I diasgree with the "naturally" part.
---
Of course your mileage may vary, but again, I've been trying this achievement nearly every day since the fractal came out. More than 90% of the time, someone immediately rushes in and fails it, sometimes out of malice, sometimes because they didn't know or care. The last 10% fails because people didn't know the pattern well enough because the attempts needed to learn said pattern take too long.
---
If you're right, and my experience is just close to average, we are talking about years before people learn this well enough, because these tries are spaced out so much. And that in a fractal that is loathed so much that it's the only one I regularly see people wanting to just skip it even if it's daily.
---
Congratulations.
---
Guardian with a rifle for a proper ranged dps build, Burn guard is meh for PVE
---
A Elite Spec for warrior i actually like....
---
I want cantha back badly.
---
I transposed the logic into the wiki (the time macro has some wacky semantics): https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Helpful_Hero#Event_Schedule
---
I hope you don't mind. Hopefully I captured the logic correctly.
---
After last night it's not literal anymore.  Now it's approximately 90.  Thank you for the info. It's what I was hoping.  I woulda been devastated if I had put in all the work and found out it's far less useful than it used to be. :)  hopefully I'll get em all farmed up this weekend!!
---
There are many other achievements that got fixed and thus made easier months after the fact. That hasn't stopped Anet before.
---
Wha- No! Alexaaaaaa!
---
You don't have your weapon skills when you carry a treasure. Unless I misunderstand your idea, it doesn't work.
---
Cringe
---
Sadly they didn’t have that option
---
&gt; If you say such things anywhere aside from whispers, party, and squad chat (where it is ONLY and ALL friends), you risk penalty
---
I remember reading a post on here maybe a year ago where someone came to complain about their ban. Turns out the person thought because they were in a custom pvp lobby (i think, could have been a sab map) all by themselves and spewing all kinds of shit into the void, trashing on other players, anet specific devs/gms, and who/what ever else. Anet still banned the player for they things that player said. From what I remember this was not a isolated thing with that player either. There was a history of them being banned for that shit. 
---
To put it all dramatic like. Anet owns our accounts not us. We play at their discretion. We are account holders and basically renting access to gw2 from them. They can cut off our access for most any reason they want.
---
How about ***you*** go back to fortnite "kiddo".
---
Next specs probably will be asian themed, would go really well, when we go to cantha :P
---
Thank you for the new copy pasta response for all pvp try hards.
---
True, it could be changed. But it shouldn't.
---
That's really what I'm missing in all of this: you haven't really made any case as to why it should be changed -- give me, and presumably the designers at Anet, a reason as to why this achievement is "problematic".
---
Cantha was my favorite setting by far.  The theme and aesthetic were really stunning.
---
...But I'm 100% with you on the missions.  So many of them were such a slog.  "Oh look, another mob of 12 Afflicted..."
---
The only time I was almost tempted to buy those rng boxes was when they contained the giant monster hunter sized bow skin.
---
Maybe a lemon would work
---
So....everyone DM me how you get this much gold.
---
All we need is cantha + ritualist. Outside of the city is still the most beautiful landscapes I've seen in guild wars ever.
---
You can get into raids on any class easily if you're not picky on what role you play or what elite specialization you'll be using. I would only suggest you NOT aiming for Scrapper or Herald, elite specs for engi and rev respectively if raiding is your goal. You might have a slightly tougher time finding groups on Tempest (ele), Reaper (necro), and Spellbreaker (warrior) in general, but they'd still be good enough to get you into enough groups. But all the classes I listed are perfectly accepted on their other elite specs anyway if that class vibes with you.
---
Both dungeons and raids should get their own daily section like fractals. That would give players incentive to play them more often and not disrupt regular dailys for quick 2g.
---
No, actually, temp-banning someone for 7 days because they used "KYS" *is* right. It's *exactly* as /u/Dornsinger described -- what you think is "just a funny joke, get a thicker skin" may be the last push someone needs to commit suicide - or murder. *Don't* ask me how I fucking know.
---
And all this nonsense of "puritanical" this and that is just you waxing hyperbolic for no good reason. If "every viewpoint deserves to be considered", you're doing an awfully good job of convincing people not to.
---
&gt; jedi saber that you can change color
---
Like a neon party-blade, distant cousin to The Moot.
---
Same, I have an insane amount of memories from Cantha and one of my biggest desires has always been to revisit it. I truly thought they were going to go to every continent when GW2 first launched. The problem is, will NCSoft let them. They basically killed Cantha due to a population of East Asian players from several different countries getting upset over the "culture mixing" that was perceived in Cantha. That's why they turned its district into a fucking *hole* in Divinity's Reach, and then filled it with cement to make a useless eagle sculpture with a pit to a once-used zone. It's really sad that they'd think a few people complaining is enough to warrant an almost complete retcon of what is a LOT of peoples' best or first experience with Guild Wars. I wish they would at least address it again.
---
Bit late to the party bit I'd like to see rifle for elementalist,  like a technomage that uses something like a thieves initiative and has a reload mechanic where your 1 skill on all elements is a basic shot, but your 2-5 skills use initiative, and you gain more initiative by reloading into another element, you could also possibly have different effects occur when you load from one to another, like a burst of steam going from fire to water  that causes stealth. The rest of the skills could be similar to scrappers gyros, but make the constructs that do various things. 
---
For warrior id like to see a brawler class that uses staff as a stat stick but basically punches things to death. Bit hard though, as the Devs would have to animate all 5 races with new attacks. It'd allow for some interesting contrast though, little asura punches vs a charr doing clawing attacks and so on
---
I haven't thought much about the other classes. Shortbow for mesmer would be good, like a bard spec maybe that uses something similar to the renegade that summons band members. I'd love another main hand weapon on engineer though, axe would be my choice but that's only because my engi deserves astralaria.
---
I know Axe and Mace aren't everyone's favorite, but Sword already weapon to Weaver. I considered a two-handed option, but chose against it. Two, separate weapons allows for more weapon set combinations, and if Weapon Swap is the new mechanic, I want to double down on that.
---
Have you ever had to call your cousin in the middle of the night because the alternative was killing yourself? I have. So no need to lecture me on suicide.
---
I think that thematic space has already been filled by Deadeye, but a Rifle Ranger has some strong potential.
---
*[Ryujin no ken wo kurae!](https://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/overwatch-animated-short-dragons-genji.jpg.optimal.jpg)*

But really, the idea of some ancient blade that holds spiritual remnants of fallen Elder Dragons is intense.

A Bladedancer of sorts. Shattering Illusions grant you a new resource, let's call them "Shards" just for now, blades of psychic power that orbit around you. Shards empower or upgrade your Utilities. Stances fit that dancer asthetic. I'd imagine it would play a lot like Irelia, from League of Legends.
---
Although the game needs being advertised, this isn't the kind of advertisement that will put Anet in a better spot. It's the "cheapest" way to make advertisement and considering their target population, it might as well remain unseen. The LA and NY places displayed in both reddit threads are places where interested population would rarely hang out (littering a liquor store with various copies of GW2 posters for example). I HIGHLY doubt their marketing team did market research before attempting to do this, it was more of a low effort "print this and paste this anywhere" sort of attempt which, in fact, may do the game more harm than good. I mean, who wants to play a game advertised in a Liquor Store anyways?
---
Second, the advertisement itself is quite weak. Adevrtisement must be short and concise but this suffers from being way too short without delivering anything. The "11 million strong" phrase points out they want to let the world know GW2 is still strong and going, and that means it's essentially made for old players or the people out there who think this game went defunct after launch. Printed advertisement however isn't the best way to do it, if that's the target public then online advertisement is better.
---
They're not telling, they are forcing by holding their unilateral power over someone who is not on the same level, has no recourse, and no-one to appeal to except reddit. 
---
If you think that's the same as me voicing my opinion on reddit, not forcing anyone to accept anything, nor banning anyone for disagreeing with me, not even blocking them, then *you* have a very definition of certain things being *the same*.
---
I recently just re-finished Factions and I will say navigating the city has always been lame but I found the missions in general to be enjoyable and the forest and jade sea bits were pretty fun. My personal ranking of the campaigns is NF&gt;Factions&gt;Prophecies.
---
How much difference does gear make? I'm slowly crafting viper armor and getting trinkets, but will it make a noticeable DPS difference? (My current stuff is rampager's)
---
As someone who majored in communications, it doesn't helps influence people more, it just makes it more visible. In fact, it can be counter productive because it creates visual pollution, which makes that people would rather look away than stop and see.
---
Raids are weekly
---
I remember way back in vanilla (do we call it that or 'base'?) guildwars 2, when hundred blades in zerker gear with 0 buffs could easily do 60k+ damage.
---
Good times
---
Image won’t load for me; what’s the TLDR?
---
If you say so
---
*unzips*
---
Yeah my dude, kinda racist
---
Delete both
---
Guardians also pop like a bubble compared to warriors. Just about everything that makes a Guardian tanky also buffs his group, including warriors.
---
So there isnt really a selfish advantage, but Guardians do lose ~8k health compared to Warriors just because.
---
I need a reason to make Sharur.
---
I have a feeling that the end of this season will open up to a Charr/Blood Legion centered season/xpac. Anet expanding the map east seems way too obvious for where the game is going.
---
It would make things worse imo. 
---
Daily for dungeons would be great like a new tab.
---
People are allowed to jib to their friends. There's a major difference between joking to a friend that he should kill himself for a missed skillshot or whatever, and actually wanting someone to kill himself.
---
\&gt;6k gold and only 5 char slots?
---
WTF?
---
I mean sure, you don't go into the 4 or 5 figure gold range by spending it, but I'd at least grab char slots until I had 9 so I could make one of each.
---
Hey kiddo
---
You should be permabanned from the sub for suggesting we go to Cantha and at the same time excluding Shing Jea Island, the best part of Cantha. I'm disgusted.
---
I use main hand dagger on my elementalist. Both condi and power dps Tempest. It's pretty fun.
---
I would like to see more use for shields, maces, and hammers personally.
---
I always thought about a non-illusion/clone based Mesmer spec called Inquisitors or Seekers. Honestly, I've wanted one since HoT. :(
---
Well it should because it breaks the design philosophy of achievements that Arenanet themselves touted for years. 
---
Stuff like long unskippable wind-ups to attempt an achievement should be avoided, and they have changed instances more than once to accomodate for this.
---
Having randomness dictate a skill-based achievement that heavily (see Instabilities) is unheard of. Yes, all fractal achievements more or less gets influenced *somewhat* by them, but none are actually made nigh on impossible by some.
---
Also, and I'm not checking every achievement to make sure this is 100% true so correct me if I'm wrong, having an achievement fail for the entire group because one person fails is either exceedingly rare, or never happened at all in non-raid content. 
---
I'm taking out raid content because the entire premise of them is to work together, and a failure of one punishes everyone. even then, outside of CMs that are presenting basically a hard mode, everything I can remember is counted individually. Same for fractals. 
---
The closest I can remember are the challenge motes for the legendary backpiece (a tangible reward people want to go for), Leave No Hero Behind (a secret achievement with a title as reward that people want to go for in larger droves), or trivial stuff that gets completed by nearly every group with *some* experience.
---
Spirit Evader, in my eyes, is clearly meant to be in the same spot that "No lasers" or not losing a captive in the Volcano fractal ought to be, but for that spot, the Maze is too complex/time consuming for average groups to complete as is. So you need special groups for it, but the reward is too low for a large enough demand for these groups. Those that care are stuck and those that aren't will most likely never get it done. My suggestions are specifically so those that care have a chance that is more in line with literally every other achievement of the same category.
---
I'm having the exact same issue! It happens occasionally in other worlds, too, but nearly every single time in 1-2 on Normal Mode. Get to the end, beat the boss, the timer runs down to 0 and then DC instead of porting to 1-3.
---
At least it's not a difficult one to do, but it's still annoying.
---
Dual pistol or rifle Guard. Could work well with Cantha 250 years later too!
---
I honestly don't get the circle jerk hate for outfits.  They were in GW1 and nobody complained.  Would I love to see more armor sets released?  Of course.  But if it means outfits or nothing?  I'll take outfits any day.
---
If only power reaper and revenant were as lucky ;p. I'd even be fine with power herald/reaper if glint gave the equivalent of banner buffs or shouts did.
---
Mace, pistol, focus, shield, warhorn, hammer, and rifle stand out to me.
---
I've found active use for each on various characters, but not as much as I'd like. No weapon is useless, thankfully, but I would like to see more being done with the variety of weapons we have outside of the more commonly used ones.
---
Hammer for the warrior!

You have a thousand screenshots.  Why not clear it out into another folder to organize them?

Avoiding a lifelong crippling debt vs shiny pixels and longer e-penis. Choice is obvious.

I played GW 2 in launch and 100%'ed it at the time -- haven't gone back since.

Now, if they brought back Cantha, I'd be back in a shot

I wish I could see the car for context.

JADE SEA GONNA BE AWESOME
---
What are some cool looking and comparatively easy/cheap to acquire sword skins?
---
6k is just whats in wallet :/ got around 50+ total and never felt the need to spend for QoL stuff (ik that sounds stupid but im really organised with what i have) so yea 5 char slots, 1 bank tab thats never full, 2 chars are perma storage, and 2 are  basically my mains. 2 items iv ever gotten gems for are Mistlock Pass and Copper salv, thats it. As for bag slots - 0 extensions, and all only 20 - but once again theyre never more than 20% full and imo neatly organised^^
---
Ohhhh I wish I could see them again! I have played guild wars so much back in the day! And just started guild wars 2. Are people still playing the first parts?
---
Nothing beats the good old "Been there, done that"
---
You must hate books.
---
Some interesting points you make there.
---
&gt;Are u sure ? My power spb usually can deal same dps like DH did in fractal/raid , the main problem is maintain the stacks of berserker's power and attacker's insight by using FC as much as possible. kick doesn't do much damage i agree , but still u have to put it on the rotation too. Empowered ally only give 100 power , signet mastery's passive only work on the target below 50%, there's a possible build that you use strengh/Arms and spb and bring 3 signet(healing/fury/rage). activate them when ready to use. but such build means you'll stuck on one weapon for 10 sec.
---
&gt;After they nerf berserker, Anet said that they want warrior player to use burst skill more often, most People just want to wait until Adrenaline up to lvl 3 then get max stack of berserker's power at once (that's why some people would rather to use core warrior). To be honest , use burst skill many times usually give u better damage output (F1 and F2 skill are burst , which means you have to use FC too) also gain attacker's insight each time Full counter hit something. So try to change your playstyle and you might see the different result.
---
&gt;Also, after last balance patch , the ..SC meta weapon (axe/dagger and mace/axe) got nerf from trait if you still use it. you'll lose 60 ferocity by this weapon build. 
---
the old-school weapon build( Axe/Axe and Greatsword) got buff from trait instead.
---
&gt;the damage boost from trait is fine , we just have to play warrior "more flexibility".
---
&gt;Warrior means more than banner slave, if you try to master it. Imao
---
I think the first reply clearly shows how wrong you are.
---
because thats what a speedhack looks like
---
I've become turned off by the idea of new maps due to how old maps have become barren. If we have new maps, I hope they don't feel as repetitive and unoriginal as the living world. Make new zones more niche in their mechanics. For example, make the Blood Legion Homelands a giant PvEvP zone, like PvP servers in WoW. Make the Far Shiverpeaks have meta events that result in access to underground, public, Dwarven Dungeons that will essentially feel like easier raids without needing to group up (helping to transition casuals into raids). Make the northern Krytan region focused on hunting and gathering with fishing, trapping critters, and gathering nodes that can be upgraded/gardened. Make the Plains of Golghein have map-wide conquest metas, like Harath Hinterlands 2.0, with the ogres that never resets (24-7 tug-of-war mini wvw/tower defense with us vs. ogres). I like how HoT maps differentiate from PoF maps with focused mechanics (metas vs. exploration). We need to keep this up to prevent PvE from becoming stale.
---
Mesmer spec with rifle. (Let's call it 'Visage' - sic!)  
---
That can either choose to use a rifle, or go into mode that makes him pretend a different class - to fool the enemy.  
---
Because why not.
---
And spend 30min on a single daily instead of 10 seconds? No thanks.
---
Why though? Wouldn't it be better if you could take an alternative, say Scrapper, access the same effects of banners but in an entirely different way? That at least allows for a better degree of variation with what people can play. That isn't a bad thing.
---
Weren't they looking to hire a French community manager recently? Maybe they've promoted from within.
---
Absolutely, especially the black citadel and stuff, honestly haven’t been back over on that side of the game in years
---
I've been levelling an alt account through fractals recently and t3 has been a much cleaner experience that I remember it from the first time in 2016. I'm not sure if players are paying more attention to guides or more likely just power creep.
---
Dual Daggers Guardian
---
&gt;so the projectile will properly hit your collision box
---
I have to get my mind out of the gutter.
---
Dragonhunter too
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
Though I don't ever see them adding two seperate weapons to an elite spec. Along with wep swap lol. Attunements themselves with the elementalist is what embodies 'elementalist', yea arcane would be pretty cool but I don't think it would fit the design if the class at all, it'd basically just become a mage from another game which I guess is what people want.
---
That's like saying a city should close the fire station and hospitals because having one prevents them from having a police station. 
---
Things can happen simultaneously when they are being done by several teams that amount to over 300 people.
---
Just FYI, skipping straight to Ascended Viper's is recommended if it's within your means. Exotics Viper's is still very expensive compared to its Berserker's counterparts, unlike Ascended Viper's vs Ascended Berserker's.  
---
As for the trinkets, it's recommended to get all of them from Living World Season 3 maps. They are the cheapest and quickest way of getting Viper's stats trinkets.
---
dh have much MORE sustain than war,+8k hp will never save you,3 sec of block with aegis? 2 heals? shield included in DPS rotation? definetly.
---
Really disappointed with all the chairs they added.
---
Honestly feels like the only reason they exist is to push gemstore sales. When I think of all the things that could be done to improve the core game instead of adding yet another chair, it's pretty distressing. My heart goes out to WVW players who had their favorite game mode sacrificed so anet could push some skins.
---
FYI the current fastest ways of farming gold is Silverwastes, Domain of Istan metas, Fractal dailies.
---
Not sure what makes you think this will work out better for you.
---
I'd be so down for that.
---
If cool is more science fiction, the engi elite spec sword from pof is both cheap in money (as you get the first part for finishing the holo spec) and easy to get ascended. Ele sword, same, more fantasy like. Also check out the scion's claw collection.
---
&gt;Most of us can take a "you're a fucking cunt" from our friends
---
But he evidently said it to someone who couldn't take it and who, most likely, isn't that kind of friend with him because he got reported for it. Soo.... yeah. Don't put your childish insults in the chat when you don't know who might read it.
---
Solution: don't buy the gem store stuff.
---
&gt; My heart goes out to WVW players who had their favorite game mode sacrificed so anet could push some skins.
---
Nice joke!
---
What is this...a glorified WvW complaint thread?
---
Or just follow the rules you agreed to follow when you installed the service you are using.  No need to make players fight amongst themselves.
---
I pretty much only play WvW and I don't mind it at all.  They definitely didn't "sacrifice" the game mode.  It was pretty broken at first but it's okay now.
---
The issue I have is that Anet knew and was aware, the longest running thread on the original forums was a petition requesting Cantha and when they wiped the old forums they let that thread go as well, with its some 30k+ responses and requests. I got tired of Anet dropping alot of balls and making poor decisions and when that thread was deleted I Uninstalled and swore I'd never play until they brought back Cantha.
---
Really disappointed with the business model they implemented almost 7 years ago.
---
Honestly feels like the only reason it exists is to push gemstore sales. When I think of all the things that could be done to improve the core game without any continuing revenue, it's pretty distressing.
---
I go to these every time Morn puts them on and they're always good.
---
What was wrong with the car in the last pic?
---
&gt;There's a major difference between joking to a friend that he should kill himself for a missed skillshot or whatever, and actually wanting someone to kill himself.
---
Okay, let's go with this hypothesis. Lets assume this is what the support staff sees in a chat when they get a report for toxicity:
---
"Oh, go kys, man. ;)"
---
Prove to me how this is a clear joke between friends and not a threat to a stranger.
---
But that means he lacks depth even among the dragons.
---
I don't think he should be the main focus of the story because it will let the story become incredibly boring.
---
In expansion maps, mobs tend to do much more damage and are much harder to avoid. As you level, try your best to avoid damage from enemies while learning all your skills and traits.
---
On top of this, once you enter an expansion map, you will be training a new elite spec. You want to know your core spec really well before moving on to elite specs. 
---
This discussion changes even more when we discuss endgame such as raids and fractals.
---
Then what was Spellbreaker? Correct, they were given two Daggers, two of the same weapon, but that's just a skin. The exact weapons given doesn't really matter, they're functionally the same.
---
As for being true to the core class, I don't see it as a major issue, because the core Elementalist still exists, as does the Tempest and Weaver. One Elite Spec that throws a curve ball isn't going to take that away.
---
For the record, slotting minstrel FB in *as* the tank is totally doable in raids. You need an alacrity Renegade buddy to do so.
---
Can't say I've tested it, but I feel like the wiki has to be wrong. It's made from the harrier insignia, it'd be hugely dumb to not allow selecting harrier's
---
Thanks for the suggestions! (I'll try and grab the Scion's Claw).
---
&gt;1 bank tab thats never full
---
You clearly don't know how to do inventory management. You're supposed to throw all the "i'm-not-sure-what-that-thing-is-but-maybe-i'll-need-it-for-later-so-i-don't-know-if-i-should-delete-it" in your bank tab, then let it slowly accumulate and when it's full, instead of being a responsible commander and cleaning your shit, you buy a new tab thus indefinitely reporting the moment you'll have to sort through all of this crap.

If a game is 12 years old, spoilers are fair game.
---
I prefer the villain to actually be a character, not just a symbol of evil and terror.
---
Yea my bad sorry. I just got a mail about being me being really poor. Sorry to bother you
---
True.
---
Timing is kinda like 1..23.
---
Kaineng was also a layered city scape with houses on top of eachother. You had the very top at the sky to the middle and then the sewers and places inbetween.
---
Could be pretty interesting with gw2s visuals if they kept that.
---
I think maintaining buff is probably one of the most standard MMO way to play a class though. You can probably look at any other MMO and pick out a class, guaranteed there is at least one class playstyle is maintaining a buff and the only thing that buff button does is start the buff or extend the buff.
---
 So no, I don't really think having physical skill sole purpose to start a buff is a problem. However I can agree that it probably feels pretty bad to have 2 of your utility slots dedicated to it. Though really right now I think this is bit of an overall problem than just warrior because if you look at all the other classes, how many of them have a slot of just a signet that sits there and do nothing most of the time? 
---
Honestly still I think at this point the simplest thing to buff power warrior back to be competitive is simply revert most if not all of the PP nerf. Worry about reworks later.
---
I see Cantha I upvote, i’m a simple person.
---
...so many karma boosts for Wintersday wasted.
---
&gt; I am about to go for the first time. I bought the original GW games at christmas ish in the sale, and am not far of finishing prophecies.
---
So it’s ok to spoil the game for this dude because the game is 12 years old? It’s not like spoiler tags are a chore to add. Get over yourself.
---
Yes, please! I really want a rifle for my Mesmer - simply because it looks cool. A few people told me it "wouldn't make sense", but heck, it's Mesmers and mind tricks... the rifle could do *anything*. :D
---
I think part of the point of tribulation is that its unfair.  Its a little more fair (and fun) doing it with a group because you watch one guy try a jump and get plowed.  Cuts down on the trial and error time
---
The Commander.
---
Yeah that's kind of the point. It's why I don't do it.
---
I....I just.... *walks away and stares at her 3,630 screenshots organized neatly in 30 Folders.*
---
So you'll call people babies for using guides, yet you want Anet to label the traps for you? Hmmm
---
Caudecus retreated there during "A Crack in the Ice" as stated by Rox. The Mursaat may be dead but theres still something left back there.
---
What is this...a joke?
---
They forced them to pull it, because a small group of people in a foreign market were not about it, however they've done it before in GW1 and the literally single most requested update/feature/expansion thats arguably the most iconic piece of their IP they swept under the rug. Saying it one time and then never revisiting it, five years later (how long that thread was up, it was created during the beta) and then failing to transfer the thread and never discuss the topic publicly again, is a disservice to the community and fans. They could have worked with it or taken a stance against nationalist sentiments, but they didn't feel it was worthwhile or profitable. This wouldn't be an issue to me if they didn't want to make any political statements at all, especially around identity politics, but they did in other ways..
---
I don't want to discuss politics, but I will highlight how they began selling old items, skins, etc from that campaign to exploit player desire without actually giving them what the community desired.
---
um and u think they would have had less layoffs if they hadnt implemented one of the best ways to make money that doesnt tip any scales of any kind?
---
Yea it took me a while to get on board, but I can’t even imagine running around without a mount now haha
---
The value is in the fact they can sell you more skins. The roller beetle is nice, but unnecessary and I never use it. Warclaw actively made WVWing worse.  The skydrake just comes across as the ghetto griffon so far. Maybe it'll do a cool niche thing, but again it's completely unnecessary.
---
"The mounts saved this stale game"
---
Citation fucking needed. The game has been in decline for awhile now.
---
Balanced Stance Reduced duration from 8 seconds to 4 seconds. 50% nerf,Berserker Stance	Reduced duration from 9 seconds to 4 seconds. 55% nerf,Gun Flame The physical damage of this skill has been reduced by 20%.This skill no longer pierces but still delivers the area-of-effect attack. i will not even talk about TRASH utilities from berserker and sb specs,bcs they are fucking joke,find rest of the nerfs yourself,if you have access to internet.
---
That's... not actually the same at all. Are you okay?
---
hot tamale
---
&gt; Bob.
---
Will he do something?
---
I fully agree that it's odd when it was perfectly okay to have Cantha in GW1 some years prior but not in 2012. Also, it's not like Guild Wars is the only game to ever represent a mix of Asian cultures right?
---
Vw golf
---
Warclaw and Skyscale. Springer and Skimmer. Jackal, Raptor, and Griffon. Then, Rollerbeetle with elements from all 3 naming conventions. Interesting.
---
Even if you can't remember all the info submit as much as you can.  They'll still respond and work with you to establish ownership so they can unlock the account.
---
Support's really nice for *recovering* lost items, not giving you stuff you never had.
---
They're also really good about situations where you bought something just days before it went on sale (classic example, expansions). If you had bought the mount skin pack at full price and it went 20% off a few days later, they'd probably refund you.
---
What you're asking for doesn't fit either of these, and just sounds like a sad attempt at abusing their generosity.
---
Oh yes, I remember now
---
Just think of all the people that cheat and aren't so obvious. This guy has been around 3 months ruining games and still going. They aren't the only one either. That's pathetic. In addition to bots, I've noticed this week has been really bad in WvW in the number of hackers. It's really ruins the fun factor. 
---
Anet's response to these people is just stupid. If/when they actually do punish the hackers it's just a slap on the wrist. In addition to the poor balance, this is one of the top reasons the PvP/WvW game modes are as dead as they are. This one bot played 3k+ PvP matches last season. That affected a ton of people's game experience. I stopped playing PvP a few seasons ago because I was just tired of the poor matches. In WvW there are hackers who camp the keep in the main EBG map. It's even worse then in PvP because it isn't just one 15 minute match. They can grief for hours and hours and come back day after day. Get banned and start another free account. 
---
You think if you had to be on a paying account for PvP game modes (bought the base game or any expansion with real money) and not a free account it might be a healthier game mode. Might bring in some money for Anet too when people have to re-purchase the game after their account was banned (if they actually perma-banned people). 
---
But at this point I think the ship is already sunk. Even if they do start seriously banning people and monitoring the PvP game modes so many people have left already there will be no one left.
---
Precisely.
---
Ive never heard of any company completely deleting a large part of their world and lore because they're depicting fantasy asia.
---
Oh, and not trying to be "that guy" but.. Can someone quantify Elona to me? Did they do a marketing and sensitivity study of Elona and fantasy Africa/Mediterranean  as well? Suddenly one is ok, and not the other?
---
Hmmm.
---
I’m about to buy one.
---
Oh, please. As if that matters in instanced content where boons are farted left and right rather trivially.
---
The time is what kills me. Lots of people love to say "it's nothing, z1 can be done in 10 minutes, z2 and z3 are maybe 20!" Yeah, and W1 zones can be done in less than 5, but I still spent three hours failing to make jumps and dodge rocks. As much as I want to finish bird staff collection and pick up a couple weapons for my holosmith, I know my limits.
---
100% the jade sea. It would be beautiful
---
They added so you can crit the bosses. For many years people were using pvt gear on this boss because there was no use to have anything else. A bit later i don't remember exact how much later without looking it up but i am really lazy so i wont, but anyway a bit later they also added so that you can add endless stacks of  conditions which made it even easier.
---
Dodging is if you press your dodge button. Evade is if your ability gives you some invulnerability frames. Warrior's Greatsword skill 3, Mesmer's Sword skill 2, etc.
---
Thank you very much. I hope I'll gather enough people again.
---
Well tbh you don't have to stress with ascended. It is only higher tiers of fractals that require it and not because it have better stats but because ascended have slots were you put in agony resistance. 
---
You will get ascended drops in fractals such as rings and the like that you can start slot in agony resitance on. In WvW and PvP you can also get ascended jewelry just by playing the game mode and earn coins for the game mode to buy them with. 
---
You got the websides for meta builds i will add meta build for WvW if you plan on playing that. http://builds.vabbi.org/
---
As i said in another post which many of you seem to have forgot, they added so you can crit world bosses which was not the case for many years and they also added endless stacks of conditions. This things were deffo making fights both faster and easier.
---
I use Chicken Chaser cause it’s kinda dorky
---
Yep, and you can mix both for the leap of faith
---
&gt; You can probably look at any other MMO and pick out a class, guaranteed there is at least one class playstyle is maintaining a buff and the only thing that buff button does is start the buff or extend the buff.
---
Other games having bad design doesnt make it acceptable here. Why should we settle for having unfun trash skills that only exist to turn on a trait when we can have fun and impactful skills that also turn on a trait? 
---
It seems that your reasonable expectations for customer satisfaction have been ruined by the video game industry.
---
Champion illusionist on my Mesmer. She is my main and I’ve Maine’s Mesmer since I started playing. Want to get fashion collector though.
---
I'd open the gifts, take the potential chopping block characters out for a five minute spin. Basically, decide on either who's closer to the characters you are keeping or who's more fun to play. Or, keep them and explore the stater areas for every race to refamilarize yourself since you're honestly not missing any tutorializing.
---
So true.
---
Kingslayer
---
It was a fun challenge and I felt accomplished after I beat it. Only the char who managed to do it may use it though.
---
My other chars use random titles that I like or fit their profession somewhat (like master carver for warrior etc.)
---
People see what they want to see. Do you know a complaint I hear all the time. That somehow, Taimi is always saving the day. I've heard Taimi being a called a Mary Sue. I don't know about you, but I've seen a few characters lay down their lives in this game, starting with your order mentor and going in to more recent happenings. Seems to me there was this dragon that died to save us. Seems to me there were other people who put themselves in harms way to save us. You may be part of a team, but you are certainly not the only person doing stuff.  How could we be a Mary Sue if Taimi is?  She always has the answers, upon which we act. Why did we get a vision in Season 2 of the eternal alchemy?  Because Taimi jumped into the machine which we were going to turn off.  Caithe has a big role in this too, we're not the only one linked to Aurene.  But you describe our bond with Aurene, while conveniently ignorning Caithes.   There are other people in this story besides us, some of whom have gotten injured or died.

You can say you'd prefer if there was more multiplayer experience, but that is absolutely a preference for a game's story.  I mean I played ESO and in that story I felt like the prophesied savior of the world, much like this game.  In fact this game was advertised to have a personal story...which doesn't sound like what you're asking for. And again, the first story, the personal story was more about Trahearne and the pact, and people complained. So what you want isn't some universally desired or good thing, probably not so much aided by people playing too much Skyrim.

While I agree that other people could do more, and it shouldn't always be you, I can also see that Anet was reacting to the will of the playerbase, and you know, having spent years playing Tombraider, I'm not thinking that a hero in heroic fiction is automatically a Mary Sue. It's your opinion and you're entitled to it. But it's nowhere near a fact.  And I disagree with the assessment.

Planty Raiders uses the title "Finders Keepers" because she keeps all the planties she raids.
---
Other characters I also tend to use titles that fit their personalities.
---
Successful sequence starts at 1:03.
---
A lot of that can go into material storage that alone will save you some space
---
You should start by depositing or selling your mats.
---
Demon's demise on necro, illustrious legend on pvp chars, silent savior on guard and others chars
---
I can tell you really did put a long thought in it! Yes, living space/annihilation would require so much writing and developing skills, long time, etc...so I really love your resource idea. It would be less harmful to the world, easier to write, and once it is resolved/come to an agreement we can work together. Maybe they should have foreign tech? different style of magic skills? The possibility is endless.

Mobile. Will edit as I go.

* Boosters. Convert to the generic boosters at the Black Lion NPCs (near the Trading Post NPCs in most major cities). Keep Karma ones since those aren't an option from the condensed versions.
---
* Bloodstone Dust/Empyreal Fragments/Dragonite Ore. Refine via crafting or toss.
---
* Anniversary skins. Use or toss. They're only a free 1-time application. Can apply them to other pieces later via transmutation charges.
---
Some random words after 5 years.

My main character uses "The Be-All then End-All" Cause it sounds cool haha. My WvW main is a necroancer and she uses "Killer Queen" though I swap to "Knight of the Thorn" sometimes too.
---
I doubt anything ANet could come up with for guardian would ever pry me away from firebrand, but I would welcome more build diversity.
---
Thank you! I was so excited, I didn’t think these things actually dropped from the boxes. I hope it gives a few people hope that they could get it too!
---
Rollerbeetle doesn't follow any convention. It's the name of the [rollerbettle](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Rollerbeetle) racers from GW1 festival races.
---
Or even the Skyscale flying over :) true Guild Wars experience right there, I'm really hoping for Cantha!
---
Different sensitivities. East Asian cultures, in general, have a VERY strong distaste for other cultures within neighboring continents. There is a lot of deep-seated racism that goes thousands of years back, and it's not really improving. Someone who is from one country saw that an aspect of their culture was mixed with the aspect of another and they got as many people as they could to vie against it. I was participating in one of the East Asian communities in GW1 back then and watched it happen, and I absolutely hate it. I truly wish NCSoft would recognize the ridiculousness of the entire situation.

It's still a thing in Germany. Well, Germany has some issues with Internet covering.
---
Revenant is basically the (evolved) Ritualist in GW2.
---
What’s the best way to complete SAB tribulation zones? I tried for the first time yesterday and I literally die at every corner. How is this even possible?!
---
Congratz and you are forgiven.
---
Friendly FYI: F6/PrintScr keys are default for taking in game screenshots. They will be placed in your User/Documents/Guild Wars 2 folder.
---
Only you can prevent phone pictures of monitors!
---
15k+ hours and not banned ... i never posted there tho since anything besides patch notes and fluff posts get banned
---
Use Tekkit SAB package for Taco. It shows you where to go, so you just follow.
---
I have it and used it to get chests / baubles, but I didn’t see paths or anything similar to the material farming routes in regular pve
---
I don't know all of what to do, but here is a start:
---
- Unless you use any of that armor/ weapons in your bank, destroy/ sell/ salvage/ mystic toilet it.
---
- Rest: https://i.imgur.com/VGkl95K.jpg
---
That alone will free up a lot. For the rest, see comments by other people.
---
Did you use the tekkit package? Did you install it correctly? Did you enable it properly? Because it worked for me.
---
others responding disagree with us. Id love to afk in a tournament all matches with someone to prove them wrong lol.
---
Bandit Skeleton keys can be consumed to add them to your wallet.
---
&gt; the game has been in decline for awhile now
---
&gt; Citation fucking needed.
---
Right back at you bud.
---
And don't even think about using the argument of "hurr durr (insert gamemode here) is dead hurr durr" because that's just utter garbage nonsense.
---
That may be true, but you have to look at the game as a **whole**. Go to the doctor and fix your tunnel visioned eyesight. 
---
I mostly just raid in PvE and while *I won't deny that things have gotten stale*, the game is far from dead. You just need to have an open mind.
---
You can consume those transmutation stones/crystal if you don't plan on keeping them for the *nostalgia-I-have-an-old-item* pings in map chat.  But you could at least stack the two stacks (32 &amp; 9) transmutation stones into one stack.
---
for the armor/skins you have, you could put them on a character that you don't really play much, for the ascended crafting mats you could acquire some of the gobblers.   You could open the booster bag and stack the boosters from it with the others and sell/destroy the bag.
---
I can't decide whether this is funny or pathetic. The group you're fighting looked smaller than you so I paused the video at one point and counted them. They had what looks to be 21 versus the 37 you have in squad. Meaning you have close to twice their numbers. Possibly even more if there are pugs floating around out of squad.
---
Does this feel like an accomplishment to you? An accomplishment to the extent that you need to make a 17 minute video jerking yourself off because you ran over a group that you outnumbered almost two to one? You should honestly just take this video and use it as review footage so you can look over it and accurately assess your group's performance because after watching this, I don't see anything worth bragging about within it.
---
I don’t mind taking the time - I just don’t like dying literally every three steps to something completely unpredictable (like grass that throws you into a pit, or a random flower that blows you up)
---
Yeah I can completely understand wanting new areas. It’s part the Cantha aesthetic and the overall lore it left off on that gets me interested, Anet could do a neat twist with us fighting the Dragon empire if they really wanted us too.
---
I wouldn’t mind seeing other areas of Cantha either, a lot can change in the many years between the games. I was always curious about the areas where the faction line drifts off too personally.
---
anyone else getting hit for 0 dmg from enemies?
---
Hope thats a promise, see you then.

I actually racked up several thousand kills with a hammer on my warrior, and I didn't even realize it.
---
It's a pity that it isn't meta, because the norn hammer animations are profoundly satisfying.
---
Necromancer + Rifle. Call it Deadeye.
---
Yea I know that's a Thief Elite, but it just sounds better for necro! Call thieves Sharpshooters or something.
---

that 66K + BURST IN FRACTALS.
---
i cant even belive i wasting my fucking time with trash like you reedit noobs,i rly wonder why the fuck im explaining demented monkeys how this game works. by the time this dmg drops under 50,boss is already dead or its next phase. just fuck off,bronze pvp masters, t1 fractal masters.
---
I love the idea of a pistol Elementalist that uses it like a revolver. Each chamber being loaded with a different elemental shot.
---
"Champion of the Gods" because I love GW1, haven't changed it since I started GW2
---
I'm a bit wary of a Greatsword damage buff, I wouldn't want to be forced into it.
---
I liked it before the Peak Performance nerf when Axe, Dagger, GS, and even Mace were all considerable power weapons.
---
I use acclaimed achiever. Seems the achievement titles take by far the most work so it makes sense to use them to me.
---
It's a painful grind. Good luck
---
The only reason I've ever considered it... Bleh
---
Havin a strong coregame  helps turn the f2p people into people who buy the expansions.
---
those jugs of water tho
---
Flameseeker, because I loved Guild Wars Prophecies and I like the link with my Flameseeker Prophecies.
