Would've been useful to have the international, English names straight in the video, but at least you put them in the description.

She is so cute and badass when she goes full maniac! I love her!!!! &lt;3
---
Just remove the stupid permanent teleport to friend dangit.
---
They used the same sentence even on the second phase when there's no wall xD  
---

---
Always brakes immersion a little but got used to it \^\_\^
---
Welcome to Tyria, you have a long journey ahead. ENJOY!
---
For the Fire Elemental Powder the wiki says 'The summoned ember is set to the local effective level..'. I am not sure I quite understand what that means. Do they spawn at the character's level or the map's? For instance, if a level 30 player uses this item in a level 50 map, will the elemental be at level 30 or 50?
---
Maybe an upcoming short story in the style of the requiem ones? I would really want to know what the picture for it would look like xD
---
&gt;"You have to be yay tall to ride the griffon.", the bulky Norn declared, pointing to to a wooden construction that had been attached to the griffon roost.   
---
&gt;"Yes yes, Balthazar is! Is big god. Yes yes".  
---
&gt;A pair of eyes peeked out of the scrap metal armour that had been painted with child like drawing of flames.   They gleamed at the sight of the starbound griffon.  
---
&gt;"Shiny" a faint voice echoed out of the depth of the suite of armor.
---
Speaking from history, if ArenaNet says that they are looking or will look into something, take it with a heap of salt.
---
no because at least I could do it at my own pace, and how quickly I did complete it wasnt dictated by resets. And because of the reset time gating, a grind that probably would have taken me a week in my free time will now probably take multiple weeks
---
It's obvious as hell you have issues with her being a lesbian, plain and simple.
---
The existance of lesbians is not political and as @Platomuses said, it's YOU who makes this a political thing. People like you don't see homosexual people as real humans so everytime they're represented in the media (this representation matters, the more lgbt characters the better understanding people should gain about them) you think it's just because of the pandering or ''politics''. No, it's because they exist in the real world. They're normal. Take your prejudice out of this community.
---
Welcome to Tyria!
---
It was more of a Futaba situation though since he kind of wanted it.
---
To be fair, almost all maps pretty much are squares, why the surprise?  
---
This map is focused on sky playing with skyscale, so no underwater content, etc.
---
&gt;Edit 2: please stop sending me DLC codes! please! I already got one! I thank you all so much but please, go make someone elses day! my years already been made :)
---
Ha! Totally cracked up when I read this. This community is amazing. Love ya’ll!
---
&gt;  what on earth are you doing that requires such a constant supply of spirit shards?
---
Ascended and legendary gear
---
I hit level 80 a day ago but now i am looking in to what i should do next
---
also, a lamp which is worth 11g atm, probably will be much expensive later on?
---
[removed]
---
And that's not a legendary...
---
I was finally able to get in after several tries, but Gorrik isn't there. :(
---
From 6 hours of farming it was about 15g/h
---
Also Trahearne cleased Orr with the power of Caladbolg, a weapon taken from the bough of the Pale Tree, the creation of Mordremoth. From the Source of Orr:
---
**King Reza:** Now, begin your final task: Cleanse this land. Restore  what has been stolen. Confront Zhaitan's power, and give Orr a new  beginning.
---
**Trahearne:** It's done. I can feel the waters beginning to radiate with the energy of Caladbolg, flowing everywhere the water touches.
---
It's clear that the power of "plant", which signifies growth and life would be the counter to death, and vice versa.
---
Can I also say there have been plenty of typos in these collections

He is in the old [command post](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Command_Post.jpg) area outside the main cave.
---
Too bad that people are working 8-12h everyday and have other things to do! 
---
Of course I will rush it if I have 1-2 hours per day for gaming.
---
I just logged in and saw it, you need to complete 12 mini collections with a 5 part scavenger hunt each, wtf
---
Found him. Thanks!
---
Maybe they are making this to be the legendary mount! With an alt skin of aurene.
---
Wait wait wait, there is a time gate inside of a time gate?
---
all the episodes are free for like 3-4 months after its release   
---
or just grind gold and buy them
---
Daily reset didn't even start the next collection for me so that's an extra day for me.
---
Why don't the NPCs have the debuff either!
---
Okay ArenaNet if you didn't want me to use the Skyscale you could've just not implemented it, would've saved you all this effort
---
I mean,this is what the post is about
---
It's already daily reset and the saving skyscales is not even unlocked for me. Finished newborn skyscales ages ago
---
Yup and whose not to say it gets timegated more in 3 more days...tiem gating in a time gate is just stupid
---
Oh noes, 4 whole days of time gate.
---
o_O
---
So this episode is like the biggest rehash of everything in HoT and PoF so far? Not that it is necessarily a bad thing it just sounds more and more like that.
---
Incidentally, I am trying to figure out what armor for Joker and Futaba cosplay.
---
i'll just stop playing instead, get fucked anet.
---
Grow lamps are going through the roof
---
It's like Exordium, but without the shapeshifting thing that makes Exordium cool
---
no england in tyria
---
Apparently you also need some stuff from LWS 2 and 3
---
Who the hell thought this was a good idea?
---
Ultimate ligma
---
Don't worry, no one cares about them.
---
Reapers are basically the OP open world class.
---
High survivability with your shroud, but still pretty decent damage.
---
Something like Power Chrono basically shits on Reaper's Damage output, but dies if you blink too hard.
---
The Skyscale is at least equally as niche. It's very slow and its horizontal flight distance is extremely limited unless you also start up high like the Griffon. For traversing maps for completion, you're still going to want to hop on a Jackal, unless the terrain absolutely forces you to go Skyscale, which is hardly ever.
---
Eh, you will absolutely _have_ to use it to get, like, one POI or some special collection event. After which it will be completely useless on any other map that wasn't specifically designed as "have giant vertical cliffs and no way around without clinging onto walls and then jumping up". It's okay. Some people might want the hover-flappy-bird anyway. Just probably not me :(
---
yeah, skyscale will probably be slower on flat maps, but it's basically griffon+springer hybrid
---
Unpopular opinion. I think it's okay to put a new dragon mount that's unnecessary to play the game behind a paywall. 
---
For one thing, as others have mentioned, all the chapters were given away free for the month leading up to the release of the story.  For another, it's not just buying something to get the mount. Getting those zones is like buying any DLC for any game, except you can buy with gold you farm in game if you really want to.
---
I don't see what the issue is. 
---
It's not like it's a better mount than that griffon. And that costs new players 250 gold anyway.  That's enough gold to buy four of the episodes, so they'd only need one more.
---
Depends on how old your install is. 
---
If you’ve got an install from release, or you’ve been pulling your gw2.dat forward, then yes. You might save a few GB. 
---
But in all honesty you’re looking at *at least*  30GB even on a clean install.
---
A company desperate to pad out content.
---
We are up on 9 days timegated atm- :)
---
If you find this fantasy story setting so unsettling and meaningless, perhaps you shouldn't play anymore. Aurene is basically a Gandalf in this situation, not to mention she is far more powerful than joko ever was. The world and lore justify her ability to resurrect and to grow more powerful, if you paid attention. Also, you are the one who feels it necessary to drop insults for no reason. So yes I feel bad for you that you think that to feel big on the internet, you have to lower yourself to shit comments.
---
Natural process of elimination I guess?
---
They showed them off in the preview stream though. They just activate with the mastery to form a trail of volatile magic.
---
At least those mounts weren't time gated, which is a massive factor for some people that might otherwise get it "just because"
---
I mean, it's not shitty. She is under no obligation to offer the community any explanations or notices.
---
Those damn dick heads. What is this shit. I want a mount. Not raise a tamagotchi.
---
There's a difference between slowing down the pace, and erecting a roadblock
---
To answer your second question, basically just avoid hearts unless you can find nothing else to do. Events are what make GW2 leveling special. Hearts, especially early on, are basically there so you're never caught in a situation where you can't find events and cant progress.
---
Also, when you get bored of one area, go to another. There's no real restrictions. You can go wherever.
---
With 4 of you, dungeons are a thing you can do starting at 30. Story can be 4 manned even by new players, and it'll be easy enough to pick up a fifth person for the harder Explorable variant. I'd be surprised if you had to wait more than 2 minutes tbh, people usually jump at dungeon parties that are ready to go.
---
Even if they removed all the timegates from the Skyscale collection we know of so far, there is no way that it could be defined as "instant gratification." And it's just going to get longer from here. Even without the timegates.
---
Magic corrupts things.  You've seen what it did to the White Mantle, and now what it did to Kralkatorrik.
---
I mean, I get why they time gate.. they don't want everyone and their dog riding dragons a half day after release of the episode.  This is Anet's way of telling people to slow down and enjoy.
---
Did you notice the rifts that did form all over Tyria? There's one in LA close to the airship you exit the final episode from.
---
These are in the air and cannot be interacted with unless you have the skyscale. Since that seems to be timegated for a while longer I guess we'll have to wait and see their effect on the old maps.
---
I for one wouldn't be too surprised to see the rifts being the cause of change brought to the old maps. And by that preluding to the story that lies ahead.
---
Or can you already interact with a rift on Dragonfall and I'm getting excited for no reason at all?
---
Nothing wrong to restrict it to lvl 80 characters only.
---
have you used its dash? it does burst of speed pretty well (and can travel even further vertically with it), a lot of map terrain doesnt favour the jackal (normally due to verticality, and tbh i tend to prefer raptor on flatish terrain because if im going to be mounted for a long distance ill just go beetle instead; and raptor does burst movement on flat terrain pretty much as well as jackal... i only really use jackal to go up steady inclines tbh)
---
Yes, but many players though its enough to get the maps, not the story. Story need time too.
---
Any idea what desert insect is?
---
At this rate they'll be selling skins for it before anyone even has it actually unlocked
---
This game has almost everything I want in an MMO. The feature lacking for me is something other MMOs also don't have: stereoscopic 3D support. This world is so big and beautiful, I'd love to be able to see what it looks like in a VR headset, for a true sense of scale. Here's a couple videos about it (when consumer VR was just starting to be a thing). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbUqJm9WQdg&amp;t=276s
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRWw37LPXZo&amp;t=621s
---
this is a big oof
---
Ask, and ye shall [receive!](https://imgur.com/a/k35LtnD) both ones I snagged during end cut-scene.
---
Yeah, not even a woof or something?
---
&gt; If you find this fantasy story setting so unsettling and meaningless, perhaps you shouldn't play anymore.
---
If you find critisism of shit stories bad, then perhaps you shouldn't use the internet.
---
&gt;Aurene is basically a Gandalf in this situation, not to mention she is far more powerful than joko ever was. 
---
She is now. Which is the issue.
---
&gt;The world and lore justify her ability to resurrect and to grow more powerful, if you paid attention. 
---
I did pay attention and nothing justifies her going from dead to blasting off superpowered elder dragon wings within the span of 30 seconds.
---
&gt;Also, you are the one who feels it necessary to drop insults for no reason. So yes I feel bad for you that you think that to feel big on the internet, you have to lower yourself to shit comments.
---
Don't you see the irony of you making shit comments and dropping insults in the same sentese where you condemn others for doing so?
---
There is already so much tied to the collection I don't feel like there even a need for time gated to draw it out. Let people complete it their pace, not Anet's.
---
And they could name it Scruffy! And it would look cute while destroying everything in sight!
---
True, this part is one of the easier of 2nd collection, you will kill this amount of mobs anyway meanwhile completing it. Just make sure to grab the buff, it stretches across all regions of the world
---
Oh lord, you just made it even better.
---
It's a way to pad out the nontent.
---
I just don't understand why they did it in 3 tiers instead of just doing a normal "kill 150 foes" achievement. It's annoying.
---
5 days that we know of lol, the 3rd collection has 3 different time gates itself.
---
From what I've seen on newer posts you have to feed then 12 times. So at least 4 more days.
---
Being upset with timegating because it prevents you from having something immediately is the textbook definition of instant gratification upset.
---
By contrast, even exercising a little patience will let people realize that they should be able to acquire the skyscale in (with current progression) a week at most.
---
A week's nothing. We all waited far longer for this episode to come out in the first place.
---
Toys cost 6g in total too.
---
I don't even want the stupid mount, I want to generate spirit shards from wings 5 and 6 again. Unlike the griffon, this one shows its locked masteries *before* you unlock the mount, making the entire EXP bar useless in PoF (and LS4) maps.
---
&gt; As a developing company anet has to gate content.
---
This is by no means a requirement to make a wildly successful game
---
&gt; You want to play a casual mmo? Then accept timegates
---
Yeah, you see... these timegates are anti-casual. These particular timegates combine multiple-hour-long activities with daily timegates. This means the casual player who only has an hour or less to play every day gets fucked, and the casual player who can play several hours a day on weekends only is fucked. The only player who can realistically keep up with the timegate schedule is the player who can play several hours per day, every day. That player is not considered to be a casual player.
---
You craft the food each time. 5 globs of ecto, 1 charged quartz, 2 meat and bloodstone dust
---
S2 too, really? That's the only one I don't own but I already experienced the story by joining a guildie's story instances... Didn't plan to buy that one
---
Finishing the collection will require tossing the new legendary greatsword in the mystic toilet.
---
I loved the risk of EvE. Helped that I followed the recommended mindset of "Treat ships like ammunition, once they're undocked, consider them already lost".
---
Was kinda annoying to lose my cloaky-cargo ship I've forgotten the name of (Gallente one.)
---
Sniped by a Tornado (IIRC? The Minmatar Tier III battlecruiser) at Jita 4-4. Wasn't carrying cargo so that helped a bit. But still annoyed since I used a bookmark to get me guaranteed inside the docking radius. It just didn't trigger docking fast enough. Oh well.
---
But GW2 is nice in the sense I don't have to watch my back every second.
---
idk when i learned of timegite within a timegate i just closed the game
---
I'm pretty sure you can just get those on the tp even without buying LW2
---
Perfect. Thats good to hear.
---
I had the same thing. In my case I just restarted the instance and it worked.
---
&gt; So I can actually make it through a null gate without it taking 30 seconds to load and discovering I'm already in a pod (at best). 768kbit DSL that constantly crashed did not a fun EvE experience make.
---
Haven't played EvE in a few years (at least in Null anyway) but I wouldn't be surprised if this still happened, even with gigabit!
---
Shes a goddess of MMos. She deserve it :)
---
Don't forget that the skyscale requires a grow lamp, currently valued at 90g.
---
"but you can just craft it!"
---
Opportunity cost is a thing. If you crafted something sellable that's worth 90g, you effectively spent 90g.
---
The skyscale achievements are the worst thing about this update.  Its not fun at all.  Collecting 50+ items around a map you pretty much need a guide for, time gated collection pieces, and then the normal mastery progression after that.
---
Okay, I get it.  Its a freaking new mount.  No, I don't want it easily or even need it on day 1.  However, I do want it to be engaging and interesting to obtain.  Collections are neither of those things.
---
Flamethrower is best for things like farming mobs. Combine that with action mode and yeah, you can hold down left mouse button IIRC (Been a while since I've ran flamethrower on engineer!) and just tag *EVERYTHING*.
---
It's quite neat!
---
This post is a troll 100%. Dont waste time responding.
---
that looks awesome, tattoo worthy even...
---
Wow. Glad I have no interest.
---
I'm very confused by this. Are you not getting it out of principle? It doesn't seem like it requires anything overly difficult so just playing every day with minimal effort will get it eventually.
---
Am I the only one who thinks that Aurene can back just a little too quickly? I knew she’d be back but I think bringing her back in the first few minutes just defeats the whole ending of the last episode. I’m okay with the Joko’s magic and stuff but they should have drawn out the hopelessness of the situation. At the end of the last episode your struck with like “oh Damn we’re screwed aren’t we” and then five minutes into the next episode your just like “oh welp never mind your back now let’s go kick some elder dragon ass” and I liked the dragon chase thing, I liked the map, I liked everything else. I feel like they should have drawn out the first five minutes into an hour, give us a more dark and hopeless feeling, like LOTR or something where your just watching the world go to shit around you, and that would have made aurene’s return more powerful, rather than bringing her back and grounding the dragon in the first ten minutes of the new episode.
---
I’d actually suggest reinstalling from scratch. 45GB seems a little large, and the new download would be at least a little smaller.
---
What is this? Tamagochi?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bp5mhn/skyscale_even_more_timegated/
---
Along with 4 stacks of each LS4 map currency, and some vendor thing that costs 100,000 Volatile Magic, and some vendor thing that costs 10,000,000 karma.
---
Does it require you to go back to Almorra after each tier completion?
---
No I'm sick of Anet cowtowing to the whiners and loudest players and I'm saying this as a filthy casual. The 400 elite spec change was a mistake and honestly I'll lose faith in Anet. They need to stick by this. Downvote me and call me all the names under the sun it won't change my mind.
---
I am not sure I like it, either. I actually wanted Kralk to be this living, careless storm that devours everything in its path.
---
They wont shorten skyscale collection because everything is already in place but they might make future collections ones shorter/smaller.
---
Im ok with the collectiom being massive it just shouldnt be timegated as that is not hard its just annoying
---
It's a trap. The more we complain, the longer it gets.
---
Maybe u/that_shaman data mined them?
---
Cuz #repetitablecontent
---
/Rolleyes
---
And the idea behind it is: the more you spend in game, the more likely you'll spend money on their cash shop. A very flawed idea because humans aren't that easy to manipulate... right?
---
Hmm.. May I ask why r u even here then?
---
I don't understand this studio's obsession with pissing away goodwill from the players. They build hype teasing the mount, announcing the PoF meta rework, bonus event weeks... and then they go and pull this.
---
Yep.
---
1. Mount Skyscale in midair.
---
2. Turn rifts into Volatile Magic path things like they showed in the stream.
---
3. Launch off walls.
---

Just saw someone mention that but apparently the price skyrocketed to 100g or so... No fucking thanks, I already spent 250g on griffon and I'm just slowly getting some gold back now
---
Gives me an Aurora vibe to me. The Season 3 trinket, which, the tinegates are annoying but besides that I dont mind a big chain to get it
---
Y...eah I'm going to pass, this isn't fun it's obnoxious.
---
ikr? Now some of the whales who just drop cash instead of time on the game won't have the mount so they won't be dropping 25 bucks for a 2k gem skin
---
i feel like this would make more sense if the buff vanished on map change, since you could "save" progress
---
but then they realized that dragonfall has too many event mobs that dont count
---
Do you just find things to whine about in your spare time? 
---
I'm showing the full set because each piece looks good. People can mix and match, or not, to their liking.
---
I'm probably alone in being ok with it being timegated. Means I can spend time doing other stuff, sleepy coping away at it. Gives me a reason to log in every day.
---
I get people's frustration though - the expectation was to get it in one quick burst. At least there's roosts around to play around on them still on the map.
---
Its time gates all the way down.
---
That's exactly what i want! I forgot to mention. I don't want to profit. I just want to get the liquid gold to buy gems (also sunrise's skin(. Guess i'm doing it then. Thanks!!
---
Ooh nice, thank you!
---
Ahah. Lily had mentioned Missed Connections during a [guild chat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Chat_-_Episode_79) from last episode and I was wondering where it had gone.
---
That's one mistery solved.
---
Explain to us how 'go here and press F' is fucking roleplaying?
---
Backlash? Do we know how’s the reception outside the subreddit though?
---
Doesn't need to be instant gratification, but it could at least be fun/challenging to earn it.  This is just... doing a bunch of boring tasks everyday.  Plus from a returning players veiwpoint, finding out I apperantly need charged quartz too?  I'm timelocked for at least 22 days (assuming this is the only step) running *old content* just so I can try out the new mount? 
---
Hard to get excited about it.
---
I could appreciate the RP viewpoint, but Arenanet has already ruined that for me with their lack of consistency of visual design.  Hard to stay immersed when a neon charr with Goku hair glowing with the force of a thousand suns come barreling right by on a hot pink glowing space griffon.  And RP should never come at the expense of actually being fun.
---
Oooohh damn u cleaver marketers..
---
so do you really think it is okay to put timegates into a timegate?
---
You *should* be whining about not being able to grind it out on one (or perhaps two) of your free days. If the whole thing takes 10 hours, it should take 10 hours no matter how you schedule those 10 hours. It should be up to *you* how you structure your playtime, not up to ArenaNet.
---
Grow lamps, yay!
---
see: literally most map chats right now
---
Are you sure you're 225, and not 224? Also, make sure you don't have any letters typed in the search bar in the crafting window.

Condi fb here, with full Grieving and Sinister mix.
---
Use healing mantra to block attacks first, not to just heal. Stay with your group to aegis them.
---
Use always Fire Mantra off cooldown. Never use all your mantra charges unless in a life or death emergency.
---
If there are hoards of enemies, you spam the shit out of your fire tome. Stove it before the last enemy dies, recharge, reuse.
---
Spam scepter and torch 4 always. Occasionaly rotate to axe, but scepter's symbol is stronger. Your third weap skill is always a good cc on scepter, axe and fire tome.

or just go to dry top

season 2 is just instances, dry top is in the f2p
---
as for season 3, it's go to bitterfrost... or do claw of jormag. they give you a base game choice there too.
---
Yes. There's nothing wrong with exercising patience.
---
It's part of the costume.
---
Mine tells me to do things. Bad things.
---
Chuckled a bit too loud.
---
Awk stares from around :D
---
When it's described as that, it's not. But searching the maps (exploring) for items, healing skyscales, feeding baby skyscales, bring limited to how much they can eat per day, etc is all roleplaying in it's basic form and probably about as close as you can get in a game like GW2.
---
See, now THIS is what people should complain about. This seems like a bug to me.
---
Better than McDicks?
---
Thanks. :) I was waiting for a more picture friendly guide heh
---
You seem pike someone that never grew up with Tamagochi. Those worked off of a very similar premise, and were wildly popular.
---
These comments are so funny.
---
Yeah I have tried that but it hasn’t worked so far, really hoping it gets fixed soon.
---
Game companies want you to stick around.
---
It is instant gratification unless it's a required part of the game. That's like complaining about legendary gear being time gated for returning players that don't have the resources they need to create/buy the materials
---
This was my biggest concern, I though anet wanted to keep players interested., I thought they wanted there playerbase to grow? Weren’t the layoffs because of major sale drops?? This only makes more people want to quit, which would mean more sale drops. Its crazy they didn’t see the backlash coming
---
Which toys?
---
That's it exactly, games are competing for eyeball and wallet time.
---
i play this game for 7 years, i never needed shitty time gates to stick around.
---
Why even make you do it all at once, though? It's just silly.
---
so, do you really think its a good player expecience, to tell a new player about this awesome new mount which you can get, but there is:  
---
you have to unlock the collections over 4 days. inside 1 collection there is a collection, which can be finished only in 3 days (who knows what comes in the last 2) but also you need charged quarz which would take another 21 days if you got none at all.  
---
chances are, you can feed the scale only once per day and take even longer.
---
Wew u beat dulfy?
---
Wallhop, Aerial rescue (same as griffon), and the ability to do something called "rift repair" at fixed points in the map sorta like how beetle can smash certain walls.
---
I think it's meant to be a time sink until we hear next season or even next expansion
---
I came back after a half year break specifically for the new mount. Read what it entails and logged out again. Oh well.
---
Moooooooney grab
---
I’m still getting over the fact that a story and content update called ‘War Eternal’ took a couple of hours total, never mind convincing myself to grind out a timegated dragon that looks like it bashed its face into a wall.
---
Aurene is literally crystal dragon jesus.
---
Don't wanna crush your dreams, but you simply can't have a civilization there. You are basically in the middle of the ocean, on a dragon's body, with unknown magic from the Mists.
---
Realistically, it's not like you are forced to live there because there's no more land somewhere else. Also, this is magic from the Mists. It's quite different from purifying Orr.
---
I guess this is the “meaningful and rewarding content” they were promising? If this is there idea of that then the futures not looking so bright
---
Not in the slightest. I finished my first legendary 5 years after making my first character because gold is inherently timegated unless I were to grind. I chose to explore instead. 
---
I'll admit that everyone's going to be different, but with the amount of content in this game can you honestly tell me that you're completely unable to find anything fun to do while waiting for reset?
---
Exactly! Finally a voice of reason amongst the madness.
---
&gt; "have giant vertical cliffs and no way around without clinging onto walls and then jumping up"
---
Maybe I'm missing something, but is the actual skyscale mount not garbage?  I thought I remember hearing that clinging to walls would refill endurance and that is definitely not the case for the ones around dragonfall.
---
I know this is rude but I’m curious, what would make you not afford 40 dollars but have time to play a video game?
---
Damage is calculated when the hit occurs so you could gain a buff mid animation and still get the boost. This plays into some DPS rotations like deadeye and soulbeast.
---
Just responded to another person with this, but think it worthwhile to mention here too. I'm relatively casual in my play because of limited time.
---
The Griffon took me a month because I had to save up the 250g, and forced me to farm, which is a waste of what little time I do have to play.
---
You're welcome to your opinion, and I won't dissuade you from it, but I don't think you're trying to defend the group you think you are.
---
Sadly it's still crashing. I've deleted every addon including GW2hook, removed addon files, repaired my game client and attempted to reinstall, but I still crash the second I load into a map. :[ I'm so sad rn, build templates are my lifeblood. i have like over 20 builds i use on my characters and swap through on a weekly if not daily basis lol. i wish delta luck in fixing the addon!
---
Once you finish one collection you can't start the next one until the next reset. 
---
For example, I didn't get the eggs done before reset either. Getting them done now, when I'm done, I have to wait until tomorrows reset to do the next part.
---
That's how it usually is. One step forward, two steps back
---
Joko saved the day again !!!
---
I used all my charged quartz to make some money from the tp. Making that much gold from people wanting to skip the wait is worth waiting for a mount Ill barely use anyway.
---
Woo, 22 day timegate if you don't already have the crystals. This shit is not okay.
---
Say what you will, Aurene at least was useful and helping out.
---
More QQ is suppose
---
Darn… really should have got it done... 
---
Got stuck on egg#17 and it was really late (crying)
---
I haven’t looked into the size recently but a couple years back it was maybe 32 clean? With all the maps and new content I could see 40 be the new minimum. 
---
I mean, why not just do it and see? Worst case theres no change.
---
You might be on to something with that.  Kind of a literal Deus Ex Machina, but with precedent.
---
and whats the point if that little story? griffon is not timegated, you can get gold at your own pace...not only 1 gold per day or something like that.
---
I loved the suicide pact.
---
Like who didn't expect we would do that...?
---
"Here's the goddess of life, let's revive people to give them their life back ... oh a suicide pact, my lucky day"
---
I have been to them since the PoF launch, yes. In fact, doing the legendary achievements now is far more difficult because of the low population on those maps.
---
While not LW, there's realistically only 1 day per week that I can find a group for Vinetooth Prime, and that's not a guarantee depending on who actually wants to do it at the time.
---
Similarly, I've slowly been working through the legendary trinket achievements, and it took me a month on Draconis Mons before a group formed to run the meta while I was online.
---
Compare that to the high numbers on the new map now, where my 1 hour of play time this morning, during off-peak hours had the meta complete successfully. There's no comparison.
---
You can’t even login for 15 min for the daily 2 gold?  That’s a bummer... even when I can’t play I’ll login and do dailies... even on a shitty business laptop from a hotel.
---
FFS
---
more whining about free content and a mount that is likely useful that doesn't require gold? cry me a river
---
Im not sure what you mean? You don’t need money to have time to play something - you can still use games to get your mind off things or to just relax cause your table is clear
---
Even outside of it, for some players there's already a timegate in the form of the Charged Quartz. That should already be enough of one.
---
Shareholders won't vote for "here this is the new mount enjoy".
---
Neat design. What do the female models look like for them?
---
I would buy it, I'm ashamed but it's true.
---
I wonder how long Anet will plug their ears and try to ignore all this outrage
---
I love Anet, but if this damn dragon takes this long to get, they better rework it so it can fly way farther without stopping for a nap.
---
I am SOOOO happy that it is time gated, I love that all you little impatience are bitching and crying about i have to wait for something i want right now, I also think a lot of you will downvote this but i want a reason to keep logging in each day and not rush through the content in the 1st day it is out.
---
It's a male-only race. They're adding bunny girls in the same expansion
---
TBH, I've just made another set of PvE Legendary Armor. I can wait out timegates. I don't even care about the mount now, I just want that nice Mastery Rank.
---
Gold is absolutely a time gate for casual players, unless they choose to open their wallets.
---
The point I was making is that the gold gate for the griffon forced me to play the game in a way that I don't consider fun. I understand that there are people with thousands of gold on hand, and you're probably one of them. A lot of casual players like myself rarely have more than 20-25g at any given time though, and have to either wait a very long time to get something like the griffon, or spend time doing something in the game that goes counter to our normal play style. 
---
Clearly everyone's different, but the week's worth of timegating on the skyscale seems far kinder than the gold gate on the griffon.
---
Genuinely fuck off with this ANet, this is such a lousy way of trying to make sure people keep coming back
---
Also the collections themselves are so repetitive its rediculous, you can't timegate AND make such awful collections and think anyone will like it
---
M O R E
---
C O N T E N T
---

---
*smiley face*
---
Also, make it 60$ and market it as the ULTIMATE mount.   
---
In the next patch, release a better mount for 80$.
---
No.  The alternative is to make the journey compelling and disguise the time gate as something that actually takes time to complete.  If your content was so short that you have to set a time gate, then you need to rethink your content.
---
I unlocked the skin via wvw reward track and only received the medium one.
---
She unironically does, yeah.
---
Aurene does what Kormir Abbadon't.
---
It's weird-that's almost certainly their rationale behind making the griffon cost so much money.  But this just makes absolutely no sense.
---
Because for some people, its not just a week or so. There's another post of a guy who can only play once a week. That means the mount will take him something like a month or more to get.
---
It's the fact people are being told how fast they can get these things.
---
Time gating is a (rather crappy) way of hiding lack of content behind having to wait. It's not insulting to say an opinion that it's a bad mechanic.
---
On top of that, putting a time gate inside another time gate is just making the problem worse. Yes, player's are impatient since they want everything now. But people that have this content paid upwards of £30 possibly. There used to be a day when you bought a game, you got that fucking game completely. You didn't get given a quarter of a disc a day and told to wait and stop being a prick.
---
And, yes it's a valid argument to call people impatient, but you don't do it in an insensitive way like that. Where did I say anything against the point? At the end of the day, how are Anet gonna know not to do something like this if players don't speak out about it? It's feedback, as whiny as it may be.
---
&gt; I thought I remember hearing that clinging to walls would refill endurance
---
...
---
&gt; This requires at least one bar of endurance.
---
I don't think it's what they were thinking of.
---
My Guess: The continent/Planet itself.
---
Similar to the Titans and Gaia in greek mythology
---
???? It's gonna take less than 3 months to do this collection, unbunch your panties.
---
When I first saw the skyscale, I thought it would be a straight up replacement for Griffon. Turns out the griffon is still better by a decent margin.
---
Cantha would make me very happy, but Charr stuff is kinda my jam. Getting to see Rytlocks homeland and rock my Blood characters in an expanded Ascalon would be fantastic. The issue is I can't really imagine a story there. Norn would probably revolve around jormag or the dwarves/dredge so that's probably more likely.
---
Please don’t put the spoiler in the title. I’m sure I’m not the only one that had this spoiled...
---
After your exams (good luck) the skyscale collection will be there for you to work on.
---
I would question why you aren't running fractals, leveling your PvP rank, running raids, etc, and just logging off.  If you're just playing for the mount and nothing else, surely you'll be just as bored once you have it?
---
A buddy of mine at reset said "hey, you need a grow lamp for this-get one while you can".  I bought one for 38 gold and less than 5 minutes later they were sold out.  Absolutely insane.
---
Its not new, this was how people did daily/monthly reviver. :)
---
&gt; Quite a few people couldn't relate to Aurene (or care about her) because she couldn't talk for such a long-ish time, iirc.
---
I was thinking about this this morning. When she's first introduced, she was still a baby. Human babies take a little bit to learn to talk, so I guess it's understandable.
---
Lmfao, unless you're [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bp6quf/i_can_only_play_saturdays/)
---
I've gotten used to not getting everything in mmos and only focusing on what I'd enjoy doing.  Don't enjoy pvp?  Never got the warclaw.  Don't like boring collections?  Will be passing on this mount too.  I play games to have fun not be bored or stressed.
---
Yeah. They do seem smaller than they should be. I used the mini map to find them since the icon sticks to the sides of the mini map box if they're not in view.
---
I use my griffon for everything lol, it's my go to and most of them I just hop and glide on the ground with it.
---
H E Y , T H A T ' S Q U A L I T Y C O N T E N T
---
Yes and no. 
---
It won't be worth 90g in about a month.
---
The bubble is bound to burst sooner or later, burying most of the market, including GW2, under it. It will likely happen in the mobile market first simply due to how ridiculous it is. But I bet it's still ~5-6 years away at this rate, if the anti-gambling/consumer protection legislation does not take its toll earlier, which is unlikely.
---
&gt;but the alternative is a dead map 2 weeks from release
---
I mean what would you call an alive map. I'd personally call it one where the content is getting done fully and the metas being done regularly.
---
Making players run around collecting eggs and not caring about the meta is not that. A map can be dead even with lots of people in it (**By my definition**)
---
&gt;players burning through everything in two days
---
Now players that do that then complain on reddit are cunts, yes.
---
Whenever I, or my partner, do that, we admit we burnt through it, and either do something else in or out of the game. It's nobody's fault but our own. We have other games, we have things like Netflix.
---
Having to revisit dungeons would be nice, but we all know Anets given up on those
---
https://i.imgur.com/MpK72jW.png
---
Does it apply the down state penalty? You don't get it in the training area so it might be more efficient there but skimmer quicksand works too, whatever gets the job done and doesn't involve jumping off great heights and spending large amounts of time to complete the achievement.
---
Honestly, the first time I saw that, I thought it looked like something straight outta Phantasy Star Online, kinda similar to Dark Falz, but not quite
---
Why on earth do people think putting spoilers in a title is a good idea?
---
Give me one set pls T_T I just want to play around with builds but I don't want to hardcore raid..
---
&gt;Unpopular opinion. I think it's okay to put a new dragon mount that's unnecessary to play the game behind a paywall
---
I disagree i think it is a GREAT idea, but what we are seeing is a bunch of entitled, impatience players looking for instant gratification, crying for change because they cant have what they want right now. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In a few days when you start see skyscales in other places than dragonfall you will see the players who MAN'd up and did WORK
---
cursed_asura
---
Again, you're not really defending the group you think you are. I'd rather take the gate on the skyscale over the gold gate of the griffon because it doesn't define the way I play. At least with the skyscale I can still have fun with my limited time. With the griffon, I had to grind for it. At least to me, grind =/= fun.
---
By contrast, similar to making my ascended armor, I can just do 1 thing each day for the skyscale then go on to do my dailies, and maybe a fractal or two.
---
So they created this collection for the opposite of the kind of players who play gw2 for what it is rather that hop on another mmo? 
---
Its a huge failure if so.
---
We used to use leeches to cure ailments and believe flies spontaneously sprouted from rotten meat. Something being around for a long time does not fucking mean it's good, desirable or normal and as far as I'm concerned it sure as hell does not mean I gotta put up with it cause "it's always been like this". About the shareholders argument of the other guy, I don't know and I don't give a damn either; a shitty mechanic is a shitty mechanic, a shitty system is a shitty system, and to hell with "MMO nostalgia".
---
They never stopped doing collections for legendary weapons. They saved them up and fused them into one big collection for this mount.
---
Is this an out of season April Fools joke?
---
Just find because capes tend to be ugly IMO
---
*What-the-actual-****----***
---
&gt; You will be able to break ALL terrain with this thing at your disposal.
---
You already can with the rest of the mounts. That makes this mount horizontally analogous to the current set of tools we already have. It is nothing better.
---
&gt; Just because it's a feature of this update doesn't mean you should be entitled to it any more than you are entitled to the legendary greatsword.
---
Yeah, the difference is the legendary greatsword is not timegated and people built it instantly when the patch dropped. Bad example for your argument.
---
&gt; Secondly, they don't want us to burn through the **n**ontent too quickly.
---
FTFY
---
&gt; There may also be an instance at the end, which they want to surprise the community with the reveal.
---
So wait and release the Skyscale then. If that's the real reason why, then anyone who did not start Skyscale day 1 and keep up with it every day will not be able to participate in the new event day 1, which is, like, really shitty for income and what not.
---
&gt; Third, we've seen worse timegates.
---
"There are starving kids in Africa," otherwise known as the fallacy of relative privation.
---
&gt; And few people complained about that.
---
Probably because those things were, you know... *legendary.* Something the Skyscale isn't.
---
&gt; Again, this mount is kinda OP.
---
Again, it's really not. It's barely better than gliding after jumping up on the Springer.
---
forcing it to last will never be the same as a product that was designed to last, no matter how stupid and indoctrinated humans become
---
Good for you, enjoy it then. Doesn't mean it's good content design by any means.
---
i was reading gynos for a sec there
---
How does heal engi cap might? For heal Ele, is it hard since you have to go out of water to give might in fire and protection in earth?
---
dulfy is missing because she cant finish her content guide due to the timegates
---
Pretty sure the writers really changed their opinion too.
---
Same here.  I figured I was just bad.  XD
---
why should i explain my gaming behaviour to you?  
---
its enough to tell you that timegates in timegates are not fun and kills the mood when you are forced to suddenly stop on whatever you just did.
---
Thats not working toward something at all though lol, its literally just waiting until you can do it. How in the hell would anyone think that waiting until you can fo something is working towards something? How is it l gratifying at all? Its just waiting. Literally waiting without doing anything. If it was a long quest or something it would be another thing but thats not it at all...
---
Have you even gave it some thought or are you just trying to insult some people to make yourself feel better about your lack of understanding?
---
I love it too...just not the waypoints disappearing at the start of the meta.  it didn't irritate me too much, but I can definitely see it causing some frustration.
---
Prepare yourself for a timegated extravaganza of collections to get it.
---
TBH, post-HOT events no longer make the original voice actress necessary. Zojja was more impacted by being in the pod than Logan; Anet can easily use that as an excuse to change her voice.
---
They're currently around 50 gold, up from like 5-10 not that long ago. If you're waiting for all the timegating you may as well wait for the price to go back down. Or if you want to wait 10 days for the charged quartz instead, I'm pretty sure you can buy the recipe in Tier 3 Dry Top without story unlocks.
---
timegate =/= content that is designed to last. punishing the most loyal fans by forcing them to stop playing the release they have been waiting months to play is not game design at all
---
The logical answer, in my opinion, would be to restrict the reward to a character within a certain range of the level of the map. That way you can still do the map on a lower level character but forgo the reward.
---
Just removing it from BF would mean people would find another map and repeat.
---
Neat. Any pics of those? Searching ffxiv bunny race just comes up with bunny ear wearing humans.
---
i thought i would be grinding for this thing and the new legendary but looks like im just fine with griffon and dusk
---
Where's the epic part in pressing F around the same map 60+ times?
---
Its a shame, such a good patch to be ruined by this shit at the end of it
---
That's exactly what they are, their race is the Viera, but they're human women wearing bunny ears.
---
The fight felt a liiiiitle Zhaitan-esque, but the stage mechanics broke it up pretty nicely.
---
Good:
---
\- The cinematic work is amazing. That's an expansion's worth of cinematic work and set pieces. Just mindblowingly AAA.
---
\- Epilogue is a nice touch.
---
Bad:
---
\- Although there was set up done in earlier episodes to explain the first act, it was too soon, without agency from the player and undid the good work of the end of the last episode.
---
\- The episode (map meta and exploration notwithstanding) was way too short.
---
\- The Kralkatorrik reveal was way out of left field, convenient and not properly set up.
---
\- The way the major story issues were set up from the previous episodes were addressed in a way that felt disjointed.
---
\- This episode should have given closure to ALL of Destiny's Edge. No Zojja was a big letdown.
---
&gt;free
---
&gt;new item on the gemstore required
---
Hmmmmm
---
I already made the decision to boycott the mount collection until they do exactly this.
---
Here are screenshots of this final cinematic in 4K, if anyone wants; there are \~45 of them in this album. 
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/Be5rnxF?](https://imgur.com/a/Be5rnxF?)
---
Why do people say this?  Is it just because folks do fractals and not dungeons?  What was the original point of the dungeons?  I just started playing a few months ago.
---
Thats... Highly unfortunate.
---
I fuck I’m sorry I don’t realize. I’m on mobile and you see the tile first. Never used PC.
---
The griffon took a lot of work and the dragon takes slightly less work.  Its kind of a step back from the griffon speed wise as well.  They are both unnecessary and the thing everyone wants.  Its a time sink but thats hardcore content for players.
---
What I hate is how the skyscale can have controlled Z axis movement while the griffon has a single button for straight down.  While I get the idea they were going for it makes the griffon extremely clunky and that is made worse when the skyscale is much better.  Its like Anet saying they could, but didn't want to make the griffon control so badly.
---
Waiting =/= working
---
Okay anet this is NOT looking good at all
---
At first I thought this was sarcasm, but then seeing your other comments, why do hate people. There is nothing wrong with the collection itself, I haven't heard complaints about what in the collection, the problem is that its so heavily time gated that people can't complete it casually at their own pace. Well I guess they can, but every day that someone doesn't do a part of the collection sets the entire thing back. Anyone should be able to do it at their own pace and not Anet's, whether they do it in a weekend, or spread it out over a month. If there is a reason for the time gate then they could at least tell us why or just have delayed it. If this is supposed to be some form of "current events" then it definitely doesn't feel like it.
---
Yea, looking up the other races in the game now, and they have one thing that could be accused of looking interesting aside from the beastmen race, and that's the halfling race they have there.
---
That's highly unfortunate for a game I've heard so much good about. Is this stuff standard in the other Final Fantasy games? From the bits I've seen, I don't remember seeing anything but actual humans.
---
There's far more to this game than the skyscale though. It's literally just a prestige mount.
---
At this moment in time, there's no content gated behind owning the skyscale, there's no gold or karma bonus to owning it. 
---
That, and nobody's keeping anyone in-game until they earn it. He's free to play other games while waiting. It's literally just a matter of waiting.
---
I still think this lol...
---
I'm sorry but the idea is still completely ridiculous. Them choosing to do this instead of animating a full dragon makes total sense, them making the story decision to "kill her off" because of that is totally ridiculous. Just because she's rendered like that now wouldn't mean that they would be trapped in doing it that way forever if they wanted to keep her in the story. Kralk started as just his face, and later renders included his neck and then full body.
---
Hey here's a beautiful map with an interesting and VERY rewarding meta , a beautiful new armor set achievable in-game , not in gem shop ( and much easier and cheaper and funner then requiem ) , an amazing new legendary , and a new mount that looks awesome. But lets bitch about one aspect that we have to do once , that's a little irritating.
---
The price is already over 100g.
---
I met the requirements once solo, but went back to character select bc I thought I failed it. If you get someone else in the instance with you it's way easier. 
---
Overall just try to hit the spots as soon as possible, and spam 1. One thing that also kind of helped is when you fly from wing to wing to turn your camera to the right, as if you're flying straightforward and not to the side.
---
I haven't actually played any of the other games, but I heard that the Hrothgar are based on literally a single character from one of the games, so I don't think furry/scaly/etc. races/characters are very common in general.
---
I quit the game cuz i didn't have money for a dlc and u got one this easily . Good luck dude wish ya best..
---
Wasn't aware that I was playing Tamagochi
---
I am serious. 4 of those mounts required basic map/heart completion and were tied to parts of the story. The first high tier mount was locked behind 250 gold, the second was a collection people bitched about then despite the fact it was a day or two of work at most. This mount is considerably more powerful than the beetle and as such should have more time put into it. People will just bitch whenever they don't get what they want immediately. If this collection was all doable in one day like the beetle people would still be bitching. It's an MMO, it has long term goals. So yes I am serious with my question, if this is laziness and bad design how would the average player, in their infinite wisdom, implement a better one?
---
&gt;So they created this collection for the opposite of the kind of players who play gw2 for what it is rather that hop on another mmo? 
---
Nah, I didn't realize people loved gw2 because it was different than all those other fomo mongering games that make people feel like they are forced to log in everyday or get left behind. That's absurd!
---
Anet are telling us to kill ourselves...
---
You can do it solo (got it second try), but it's way easier in a party.
---
Remember how they removed the locked raid mastery from blocking exp gain? Guess who's back.
---
To go beyond the joke. I had a signing with Nolan North at Supanova (australia's take on a pop culture con) and he said he'd be voicing another upcoming villain. Now it seems obvious he was talking about kralk but at the time we were clueless as to who he was referring to.
---
Do collections of living world seasons ever get discounted? I really want season 3 but don't want to pay full price :(
---
The exploit being the drop chance is too high probably
---
100% agree.
---
That the best! I don't even need to buy the game then.
---
As opposed to the other mounts not breaking the maps? Cmon, springer and griffon can get you pretty much anywhere
---
Rent-a-skyscale. You can borrow them at a certain point in the story.
---
You should deffo do all the dungeons if you're new. They're good for teaching you the basics of the game. But as someone below me said they've not been updated for a long time, with fractals being the regularly updated 5man content.
---
Whats the diffirence? Like, make it grindy so ppl that play 20h a day can get it ‘faster’? Then you’d complain how incredibly grindy it is. Don’t even try to bs ofc you would.
---
i dont understand why people keep saying the mount is powerful. I still think the other mounts are just as or more useful. someone please help me understand.
---
This is finally the answer to my defenestration issue!
---
It's looking up to 22 days if you don't have the charged quartz for the food.
---
Yeah, no glitches or 3rd parties were used to gain an unfair advantage, just using game mechanics effectively.
---
I didn’t think about having a party! Good to know, ty!
---
“It's like they want us to play the game or something.“
---
Waiting for 20 charged quarz crystalls = high quality gameplay.
---
which is cheaper to craft, or buying the episode
---
"Go eff yourself, buy more stuff from our cashshop."  
---
\- &lt;3 Anet
---
Knew this was coming... wonder what they gonna do, huh? Finally remove BL key from Bloodstone Fen completion or drastically lower its drop rate there or something? Good thing I've done BSF completion on all my lv80 characters I suppose
---
&gt;Firstly, this mount is basically a pseudo-legendary. You will be able to break ALL terrain with this thing at your disposal.
---
This could not be further from the truth. The skyscale is a hybrid of the griffon and springer that's inferior to both. The griffon and the springer on their own already break every single map and make world completion a piece of cake. The skyscale's flight is less than impressive and doesn't accomplish anything you couldn't already do with existing mounts.
---
The only reason the skyscale seems useful is because the new map is intentionally designed to play to its strength and downplay the other mounts by playing to their weaknesses. i.e., cliffs and branches that are juuuuuust out of springer's reach or overlayed ontop of one another so you can't jump to them requiring you to fly vertically around them, or level mountains with high ground/lots of obstacles to hinder griffon's pullups, and despite those the griffon still dominates the map.
---
&gt; Stop being entitled. 
---
Stop being an idiot.
---
&gt;Just because it's a feature of this update doesn't mean you should be entitled to it any more than you are entitled to the legendary greatsword.
---
Bad example. Stockpiling materials lets you craft legendaries practically on release day.
---
&gt;Particularly because there may be some lore implications behind Skyscale.
---
How does this justify the timegate...?
---
&gt;Secondly, they don't want us to burn through the content too quickly.
---
Make better content that can't be burned through in a day then. Waiting around fiddling with your thumbs is not "content".
---
&gt;There may also be an instance at the end, which they want to surprise the community with the reveal.
---
Griffon had multiple instances and none of them were timegated.
---
&gt;Again, this mount is kinda OP. Just look forward to this thing with anticipation and excitement instead.
---
Its really not. Its ridiculously shitty. People want it just because its another toy to mess around in or flex with and to unblock spirit shards again. Nobody is eager to get their hands on it to break any maps, because anyone with intrest in breaking maps already knows how to do with springer, griffon and bond of faith.
---
If you can point me to someone here complaining about the timegating that's hurting for spirit shards, I'll concede your point.

Yea your right you tell them. -opens tp and unloads some more skyscale food maybe a lamp or two- I support this and hopefully the next few steps also needs stuff that I can sell on the tp :P
---
I heard you can see HOT discount from in game store.
---
Makes me just want to do what is necessary daily quickly so I can go play another game until the following day.
---
I mean, epic in the sense of the amount of stuff to do. You never did anything "epic" in your way you describe for Aurora either.
---
I know, right? Such a bunch of crybabys. Get over yourself people.
---
Did the same with my adolescent Aurine.
---
"The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment..."
---
hahah dont think he meant it. an event happened to pop when i clicked the vista i think
---
Time gates are not necessarily fun, but they provide long term engagement and give you a long term goal to work towards. Legendaries *are* time gated if you're crafting your own materials by the by. While I do realise that it's not the average player's job to come up with content for the game (Thank god) I am curious as to whether all the people slinging shit at the wall have any actual *ideas* or if they just want papa anet to give them their shiny new toy now whaaaa. Being this tilted about having to wait five days is incredibly weird to me, does no one have any patience anymore? And if the argument is 'I don't have time to play many hours every day' then yeah, neither do I, but not all content should be available to all types of players immediately. There is such a thing as prestige/hard work goals in MMOs.
---
haha cant find a suitable frame. the action of it blinking non stop is what makes it for me
---
I would GLADLY pay 250g or even 500g rather than this.
---
A quick 7 character levels for 4g. ~12 levels with boosters.
---
Where in the world is Dulfy Sandiego?
---
Because the mount helps you basically avoid most ground content and skip landmasses fairly easily. It's extreme convenience compared to the Griffon which is just slightly better Glider. Also, there is a clear explanation, you're just ignoring it. They're padding content, getting players to stay logged in tomake their active account numbers look good and keep players playing. Simple as that.
---
It's obviously designed to be a map-spanning collection akin to aurora for LS3. There is nothing wrong with having one single, optional Reward that ties a Season together.
---
Requires days and days of dedicated stuff. Not things I'd normally do. So far the "temporary" mounts showed me that it's mostly useless so wasting days of efforts seems stupid. If it was a day or two collection then fine. Week long? Fuck it. 
---
Though I guess I will not be able to earn XP in any POF maps because of this stupid mount :(
---
Honestly, for me, the only thing nice about skyscale is the hover function. Everything else is largely useless. I thought we would be able to climb wall not just cling to it.
---
They just fill different roles. I mean I can descent on a griffon find using my S key.
---
So, you'd only stay logged into the game if you had the mount? You make it sound like you want to get the mount now and not log in again, since you're only logging in to feed the baby. If so, it makes sense to use time gates from Arenanet's perspective.
---
Spot on. I for one, am quite enjoying it. Almost as much as these comments.
---
Map level, as for the specific level it depends (as most open world non-Lv80 zones tend to be a level range, you might either get a summon that has fluctuating levels as with normal downscaled players higher than the level of the zone, or you might get one with a fixed level set between the min or max level, if not set to the minimum or maximum effective level of the map.
---
Oh there are reasons bordering on the obscure like this one, or even more popular ones such as preparing meta foods and saving a bit money in the long run. But to have a few more motivating reasons would still be great.
---
&gt; Firstly, the mount is an awful lot like ascended armor - shiny, new (at the time), massive gold investment, massive timesink, and not at all necessary.
---
It is also one of the only significant new pieces of "content" we got from the episode that we were waiting for for 5 months.
---
&gt;If people dislike the timegate for the Skyscale so much, shouldn't these same people be arguing that the timegate for ascended gear be removed as well?
---
Because there is no timegate to ascendeds? If I have enough gold I can instantly craft any ascended piece I want right now with no delay or hinderance.
---
&gt;On a similar note, shouldn't the people who are complaining that the collection is monotonous and lacks creativity also be complaining about how the repetition of meta-events is pretty boring as well, especially after the first 5 times or something, or how legendary collections require you to go back and do content you've already done? 
---
If I want to do a meta event, I can travel to the map and do the meta event whenever I feel like it and I won't be punished. I can do it when and how I want.
---
This collection forces to you to finish it asap because if you miss the daily reset you'll be a full cycle behind, something that happened with tons of people on release before they realized there was a timegate.
---
The meta itself is content. The collection is not.
---
&gt;or how legendary collections require you to go back and do content you've already done?
---
Except the legendaries are
---
A.) Legendaries.
---
B.) Just skins. 
---
The skyscale is neither.
---
&gt; I think part of the problem is that we all consume content far more quickly than it can be created, and so artificial inhibitions to progress need to be made. 
---
So, maybe make better content instead of dragging out the one you already got?
---
&gt; but can we all stop acting like we're unfamiliar with design choices that attempt to prolong content in a way that probably not as fun as playing content for the first time? What makes this instance of poor design choices different from any other?
---
No, we should do the opposite and start promoting them instead!
---
Playing on highest graphical settings can easily get your gaming laptop heated, especially during Summers. So look for the one with a good CPU and cooling. Fps mostly depend on CPU performance.
---
 Can't do timegate cause people have to wait.  
---
Can't do gold sink (basically a time sink).  
---
Can't do challenging content because 2019 casuals won't allow it.  
---
Can't do in game casual content, because too much effort..
---
Enjoy your glow lamp price spike and gathering Charged Quarts Crystals if you haven't already and god knows what else after that step.
---
I'm glad that Blish isn't around to see this.
---
I hope they change nothing. There's a difference between taking criticism on board and pandering to bullshit. You lot need a reality check.
---
I actually enjoyed most of the day 2 collection, got to do a few events I hadn't done in a while, though it did drag on a bit towards the end ... 
---
But this? It's getting beyond silly now. What about collection 3 &amp; 4? How long will they take? At this point I'm expecting week long gates per item plus a pointless gold sink, just because. 
---
Such a shame, I was hyped for a new mount, but if I keep up with it it'll only be due to sheer stubbornness, and by the time I finally unlock the damned thing I'll be so sick of it I'll never even use it. 
---
GG Anet, GG.
---
I really want to do this with my Kodan tonic now
---
To me, time gating is an easy way out when it comes to making shit difficult... Just design achievements that are tough to get but rewarding
---
Ffxiv is even more time gated
---
So Aurora is a scummy predatory legendary because you need all of LWS3 to obtain it?
---
Trust me, they HAD to do the quick rez. They wrote themselves into a corner to the point her death was weak cause everyone KNEW what was gonna happen. It was so BLATANTLY obvious that dragging it out would've been bad. They made the right choice just bringing her back from the start, they ripped the bandaid off quick.
---
you dont have to do it in DR at all... the buff travels with you.
---
I felt the same way. I played original Guild Wars when it launched and loved it immediately. I picked ranger to start and had such a unique experience with a lot of head canon. I only just recently, maybe two weeks ago, discovered that you can play for free, with limitations of course. Omg so here I am with my Sylvari ranger and it is like magic i swear. I want the expansions so bad. Everything about this game is legit. It’s beautiful to boot. 
---
Hope I see you all as well! Once I upgrade lol.
---
The guy that was working on it got fired lmao so they did their best
---
Jesus christ.
---
They were giving away the episodes for free in the lead-up... so... uhh...
---
also.. 200gems is not a lot...
---
Aurelion Sol!
---
old school runescape
---
Which event? The one with the podium and re-educating the ones is the one you need to do for it.
---
I heard there was a stuck pre-event to that or something like... 6 hours ago? I forget.
---
Even if they were giving them for free, it won't change the fact that you NEED to have them all to even continue the ridiculous Skyscale collectathon.
---
No, it won't.  But not every map can be RIBA-level farming, so how do you drive map engagement without making them severely overpowered, or artificially slower to progress through?
---
I guess another way to put it, I see a ton of complaints about the time gates, but not many suggestions for how to rebalance the process without them.
---
I am sorry if you were doing it but they are right, using something dev not intended for your adventage to clearly break economy multiple times is an exploit.
---
I want to disagree, but it's hard too. Also that she can now talk to everyone, and NOBODY SAYS SHIT ABOUT IT?
---
yeah the Glossophobia egg with the teaching kids or whatever
---
Who said griffons have nasty claws? There are ardorable!
---
True, but we know it predates Zhaitan's death as the Torment's mentality is exact what is presented in Edge of Destiny, and what Glint knows of Kralkatorrik in all her memories which span only as far as the previous Dragonrise.
---
So we know that this Torment and insanity is at least from the previous dragonrise, and given there's no suggestion that the Elder Dragons were anything but ravenous unyielding cruelty just as now, it likely predates that.
---
I've been playing since launch and haven't even done a dungeon... As "social" or "kind" as this game is... The actual PvE functions of stuff that make up most PvE games are pretty much dead unless you find a group that knows their shit.
---
If I am reading you right, you are trying to feed a random skyscale? You should be feeding the one in Sun's Refuge
---
I literally came back apparently 2 days after they gave away this certain episode for free.. talk about timing
---
I agree the collection sucks... but just get all the story? If I was new to any MMO, I'd totally want to get all of the story and play all of it. Story content is typically fun/engaging.
---
I ended up just forking out money to pay for it zzz at least it isn't that bad 160 gems
---
The podium event itself is bugged? =x Try finding another IP is all I can suggest.
---
[See you guys in 4 days](https://i.imgur.com/VCjSmDt.png)
---
I'm sorry to say but legendary items like Aurora and mounts are completely different things. Legendary items are just cosmetic so fine to have long time gates but mounts are more gameplay that cosmetic and really help you out. Just think how many times you used the springier and griffin in this new map. I am pretty confident there will be areas that can only been seen with that new mount in season 5 which is enough for people to want it.  Personally I kinda don't mind the daily time gate, but the timed events, huge daily collections and the large cost for things like the grow lamp just makes a it a grind that's not fun as you are "kinda" forced to do it. Also I was hoping they where adding this to help new players get a flying mount so they did not have to spend so much money for the griffon, but I actually think its a lot harder to get this one and will put new players off. So yeah its not just the time gate why people are annoyed.
---
I used to work in software development and have about 8 years’ experience in that particularly industry.  
---
The OP’s comment is basically how you get issues fixed in the Production environment post release.  The more justified complaints, the higher the priority of the issue.  The higher the priority, the more likely that issue gets assigned to a release by a Release Manager.  Additionally if there is a lot of negativity about the issue, the more likely the issue gets fixed via a hot fix instead of a traditional release.  
---
The number one rule in software development is to pay close attention to what the users say.  You absolutely want to avoid a situation where you get no feedback as that makes fixing bugs impossible.
---
Best part is that they're foregoing an expansion and going straight to the next Episode, so you can easily expect these sort of timegated grinds to continue.
---
You do know you have to pay for it if you weren't able to get it during the free times, right?
---
Now that i think about it, we should've known some sort of grind was involved when they suddenly started giving them for free.
---
That Bubbles lives? Oh I don't know, how about the fucking ocean levels rising, tsunamis and typhoons? It's the ocean dragon man lol possibility of literally FLOODING the planet.
---
&gt; it unfortunately works because of players feeling a fear of missing out if they don't keep up.
---
I stopped caring about "missing out" years ago when things like this started and I realized that the moment real life happens I'm going to miss out anyway.
---
Companies and MMOs especially have been doing this long before this new trend of bitching about time gates. The reality is you can bitch all you want about them but you're the minority.
---
If there were no time gates much much larger portion of the population would be mad and quit sooner. They'd finish everything in the first 2-3 days and then complain there is no content for months. These people are far more likely to leave and never come back vs people who will just deal with the time gate.
---
Not a fair comparison as this mount really is nothing special and judging by the masteries it never will be anything special. It also has only one dye channel of course on the default skin which makes it even more bleh.
---
On a side note, Kralkatorrik’s second aspect is time, that’s why he and his spawn all have clairvoyance.
---
It's when you are ready to make further progress in something, but the game prevents you from doing it for no other reason than to simply delay your progress. It's different from things having to be done in a certain order, which can also delay your progress. The main idea is that timegates artificially lengthen the amount of real time that passes by before you can do a thing.
---
They can be short, like AC P3 has a timegate at the room where you encounter repeatedly spawning graveling burrows while a timer counts to 100. The same number of burrows always spawn, but there's a delay between each one spawning. An expert group of players could complete the dungeon faster if the spawn rate of the burrows reacted to the speed at which the group destroyed them; but this is not the case, so some groups end up doing a lot of waiting in this room, in between killing the burrows.
---
They can be long, like the Druid Stone collection, which requires (among a lot of other things) that you complete all the hearts on the map and buy fragments from the vendors. The entire thing requires 16 days' worth of fragments, and there is no other way to obtain them, so the collection takes a minimum of 16 days in real time. An expert player might be able to get through the actual content of the collection in just several hours, in one day, if this timegate was not in place.
---
Im so insanly sad right now. While everyone of my friends played wow threw the time we call life.  Me on the other hand loved guild wars. Bought every exp that came out. When guildwars2 dropped. Of course I bought it. Here I am alot of years later. Wanting to play this game. But my lazy butt hasn't updated my pc in 5 years. Been trying to save to build a new pc. But life always has something around the corner that makes me spend my $ elsewhere. I'm making a promise to myself. Within 2 months I will get my pc. And I will be playing my gw2!!!!!!
---
I play wvw extensively and I can also count the number of actual trolls and assholes on maybe just both hands. And that's counting the people who come and go on linked servers.
---
It's pretty amazing, considering it's an RvR PvP mode.
---
The time-gating is a irl gameplay issue but this is complaining that anet expected you to actually have played the old free game content that they were giving out for free again the past month to unlock things in this new free game content. Frankly, wtf?
---
I missed a few previous living world eps due to being unable to play. Which ones exactly do i need?
---
I feel you. I can only play when I have free time maybe 2-3 times per week because I just have a lot to do. I don't have time to go through this insane collection, which is also timegated. I only managed to do the first part of the collection, timegated now.
---
This may be the only mount I will be unable to get. I really like it though when I was using it through rentals; I was even thinking of getting the Skyscale a legendary skin when one gets released since I have a lot of fun with it, the one and only legendary skin I would have but eh...Not even the coolest legendary skin will make me want to go through the entire timegated collection.
---
That's been my general way to play as well. I got the Griffon because it interested me but the Skyscale just seems less useful even with the "climbing up walls" feature. I'd rather spend the time farming up some more Volatile Magic tomorrow and getting the home instance node to have the full set. It's a cool looking mount but if it's just a marginal side grade to the springer/griffon combo that I already have that works exceedingly well already I'll happily do something else on the days I play.
---
This helps me with a question I had. These screenshots look like what I saw when I played through it: only the outside parts of Aurene's "Elder Dragon form" are really visible. When I saw Woodenpotato's playthrough, though, you could clearly see her entire body. The center wasn't washing everything out so much and you could see all the limbs and whatnot. 
---
I didn't think there was anything wrong with my graphics settings - either in the game or globally - which look perfectly fine, have the right level of brightness and contrast, etc., in everything else I do, including GW2. It was just that scene which for whatever reason you can't see as clearly as I think was the idea. I wonder if it's his Reshade which just happens to be tuned a way that helps with this.
---
Or you do charged quartz every day like with deldrimor ingots (and or while you're looting your/someone else home instance)
---
Charged Quartz is accountbound. Regular Quartz isn't but you can only charge once per day per account.
---
Perfect! Thank you so much! 😊
---
Got 'em.
---
You basically gotta activate the podium whenever you can and finish the event before it registers.
---
Personally, i highly encourage And to continue doing cross episode requirements. 
---
What I dislike is how Anet isn’t explicit that episodes may require something from other episodes. They had been avoiding thatfor the longest time and then they spring back on something widely advertised, unlike Aurora which is legendary and expected.
---
Easy to see why they did it quckly, people are just actually freaking stupid. It's ripping off a bandaid, you do it quick, not slow. People KNEW FROM THE GET GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO that Aurene would come back if she was killed cause of Joko's magic. We knew this, it wasn't a surprising thing, it was the firs tthing the community blew up about when she died, and the first and most popular choice that was predicted to the point people HATED it. 
---
Anet wrote themselves in a corner, and they HAD to have her revive cause of Joko's magic she ate. If she didn't, we'd go "BUT YOU ESTABLISHED AN ENTIRE DRAGON LORE ABOUT THEM EATING MAGIC AND GAINING THE PROPERITIES OF THAT MAGIC, JOKO WAS POWERFUL, HE COULD REVIVE FOREVER, WHY ISN'T AURENE DOING IT? YOU'RE JUST RETCONNING THAT PART??" 
---
So they did it at the start, and did it QUICK , like ripping off a bandaid. 
---
Personally though, an idea I think would have worked was prolong her revival, have us go out as a last ditch effort , a last hooray to fight Kralkortorrik in anyway, even suicidal cause we're all dead anyway. Kralky shows up out of a portal, ready to finish us, suddenly a loud roar fires out from nowhere, a little resonance effect on the screen and sudden ringing in the audio. Kralky roars in distress for a moment before diving his head (cause only his head would poke out of the portal , or could be his whole body, who cares) back into the portal. 
---
Caithe and the Commander know what that sound was, and rush back to Aurene. Now I see 1 or 2 ways to continue....
---
1) Before we make it inside the chamber, a large blast from the top of the structure left behind when Kralky blasted Aurene, Aurene flies straight out in a burst of energy, roaring while we hear her voice actor scream out in rage. Maybe yell out Kralkatorrik's name and rip open a portal of her own and charge after him. She's either very angry in general by what happened, angry Kralky almost killed her champion and "mother" Caithe, or is somehow succumbing to torment like Kralky is, maybe absorbed some of his "tormented" magic when Kralky blasted us with it, through this she starts to understand his pain, because she is giving into it herself, she becomes enraged ,but is able to focus that rage hersef at Kralkatorrik. Now we have to find a way back into the Mists, and to traverse it. We find Aurene, somehow get on her back cause she lets us cause she's struggling with this horrific tormented anger in her (she did say branded was impaled into her body still), and since we're her champion, she has a stronger emotional connection, so she doesn't lash out at us. And THEN we get ot the point where we're flying after Kralky with all this newfound power she's gained, maybe cause she started eating just a LITTLE bit of the Mists herself in order to keep up with Kralky.This gives her a morally grey with the story now and the characters. She only did it to fight Kralky, but...she can also eat the mists, so that's concerning. 
---
2) Some vanilla moment of us embracing Aurene as everyone comes to see also, bringing up the rear. Embracing her gives us and Caithe a flashback of her eating Joko which gives us a quick explanation of what happened. 
---
Either way, there would have been ALL of us preparing for a LITERAL suicide mission to at LEAST not die like dogs, and right before we all die, Aurene makes a dramatic return that isn't too rushed or over the top. MAYBE even make players go "Hmm..Aurene isn't back yet...maybe....maybe she won't?" just a LITTLE doubt. 
---
Or just instead of her dying last episode, have her just get impaled and we free her, but branded fragments are still in her body, killing her slowly. Now we're on a clock of beating Kralky before Aurene is killed by that, with the question that maybe Aurene still can't take his place cause she might die, or might not be strong enough to withstand the new magic. 
---
I don't know, I can think of a few ways they could have done it differently.
---
Maybe ANet **isn't** some de-humanized sinister corporation after all and have some motive *other* than draining the pockets of every player they have in whatever way they can!...
---
Probably not though, proly safe to assume they're just scheming on how to more heavily fuck over their players, some of which "see through the bs" and "know they've been played by the company" yet still for some reason invest a lot of time and money into it without being pressured by an outside force.
---
I remember and I missed it. 
---
Reaching 400 wasn’t a  timegate and required more map exploration.
---
I don't get people like you, literally no one is complaining that the content is hard and that they should be handed a skyscale. The issue is that players can't work towards it.
---
Interesting. I suppose something like Reshade could cause this. I don't install things like that, because I think base game looks nice.
---
That's your problem you dont have episode, it was free for months...
---
You still get shards, but nevermind that. Let's just continue spreading this piece of misinformation to keep the community riled up.
---
Yeah normally I don't call retcon but.....this is a pretty clear retcon and doesn't mesh *at all* with Zhaitan.
---
You just need a little bit of height to chain dives and get around pretty quick.
---
Aurora isn't because you can get an ascended trinket and while it wont be as good it's an acceptable substitute.
---
There is no substitute for a new mount. It's not like I can get a slightly weaker version of the skyscale through other methods.
---
You are comparing apples and oranges.
---
Logan saying “uh okay” is one of my favourite lines in game so far.
---
That final fight against Krak's toment State felt like the abbadon fight in nightfall, with the arms crashing down. O maybe it was abbadon that whispered the pain will go away if you eat More.
---
Kralk: NUKE THE COMMANDER FROM ORBIT!!!!!
---
They were shown on the skyscale stream.
---
lmao il wait til they fix it

Could use pictures of the actual Skyscales in their location to avoid mass confusion, but other than that thanks for the help my bruh!

I was not playing..
---
No worries.  
---
I like to use my experience to talk about “what not to do” in software development.  
---
It’s kind of surprising that the issues I encountered developing business applications are virtually identical to games development.
---
And there was nowhere that stated that I needed the episodes to complete this mount collection anywhere.
---
Good bye :), thanks for not explaining just saying im wrong a bunch of times, (ive never said he thinks that , í said as fair as im concerned. Thats different isnt it.)
---
Uh.. What exactly is the reason you're supposedly listing to argue against timegating?
---
And it's account bound.
---
LS3 had legendary trinket collection requiring you to get all episodes too. It is more useful than just another mount that is not required anywhere so what's a big deal? 
---
Also, you can use it on new map anyway, without masteries.
---
Ah yes, because "it's not needed", any criticism is invalid. Nice.
---
Also nice to see you compare a mount with a LEGENDARY trinket.
---
i'd disagree, mother could be the inner machinations of the eternal alchemy for all we know. all it tells us is that something birthed the ED and nothing else (which isn't that odd a revelation)
---
Maybe its not growing as much, but its definitely becoming more obvious.
---
MY only problem is targeting. Whether I have autoattack or not, or action camera or not, the skill keeps telling me I need a target even while I have a target selected.
---
Collection icons are a new thing. They are small on purpose so they are not disruptive if you have many on the same map.
---
she probably gave up on gw2 after so many people got fired
---
They'll just make the 1 hour thing account wide to "fix" it..
---
Nobody knows yet - the collection is timegated right now and we haven't gotten to all parts yet.
---
screenshot??
---
you forgot the unlock requirements.
---
600 day time gate, min 16 hours a day farming the same meta.
---
requires world completion, and map complete of all ls maps.
---
you have to create every legendary 4x and toss them in the forge to get a gift of the dolyak.
---
So wait... 
---
Glow Lamp - 10 crystals
---
Food - 1 crystal each x 3 feeding each day per Skyscale
---
Hatched Eggs - 12
---
So we need, what, a minimum of 36 time-gated crystals EACH DAY?
---
The griffon wasn't this hard
---
Mother usually implies some attachment though. You wouldn’t say “Mother” in reference to the random atom splitting of the universe when you were dying, would you?
---
Mother is a being, granted that’s a lost term in Tyria. But the ethernal alchemy isn’t something that would be referenced. 
---
If a being popped into existence, they wouldn’t start referring to whatever random thing as “Mother”.
---
I think of this more like the series “The Magicians” where there are gods, and then something above the gods. The “old gods” I believe they are referred to.
---
In this case, I think we are just killing off what are essentially children/teenagers and we are going to piss off the parents. (That’s just speculation on my part of course, but what else are we going to do once *the only threat* (Elder Dragons) has been taken care of?)
---
I have been playing this game for a bit over a year. I haven't enjoyed any MMO until this one, and it quickly became my favorite. The finale of this season culminated all my emotions into one single moment, where all I could could muster was a simple "thank you". Thank you Anet, for giving me a game I can pour my heart and soul into, and for being able to feel yours.
---
What makes it more suspect is that unless later collections use those maps as well, what I've seen "requiring" the living story maps has been almost pointless and could have easily been put elsewhere on the main world map.
---
I was a beta player, loved the game at launch, then a lot of things made me pass on the game. I come back 2x a year though or so (can't get enough of the Halloween event, to be honest).
---
All the talk about the new Aurene quests and the dragon mount lured me back about 2 days ago....only for me to see how much work the dragon mount requires. Noping back out, LOL. I got the griffon when it came out - I think that's enough for me.
---
Sad, too. I love dragons, so I was really excited. Now I'm just like "oh, yeah, these kinds of practices are why I don't actively play". I want to love the game, I really do, I keep trying to come back just to be turned off by some feature or disappointed. It's a gorgeous game, but when I do log on to play it's normally for the holiday events and to just fly around on my griffon enjoying the scenery!
---
Griffon was expensive and a majority of players don’t have it.

Now, I guess it’s gonna be opposite now lol

Reminder that he's a guy named Peter. Stop calling him a she.

Caithe spent a lot of time with her in Tarir while the commander was away, until the commander died and she flew away to help him.

She was basically her foster mother.

The old ways are not always the best ways.

Guides help people choose how they enjoy their free time. If I don't enjoy the particular puzzle, or if I don't want to play a puzzle or hunt today, what's wrong with me using a guide so I can enjoy my (very limited) free time the way I want to?
---
All this effort so that I can go *up*.
---
Good bot. Have an [apple cider] .
---
Ahh, that hit the spot.
---
At least the story is actual content...
---
&gt; There is a 1 hour cooldown but if you use it every time its up you could map complete multiple times a day.
---
correction .. 1 hour per character.. so you could create a lvl 1.. do tutorial.. TP to friend with it.. complete bloodstone fen, get your key .. delete repeat.  No cooldown.
---
In those kinds of spots, it's usually because there's ranged mobs around, which you will not be able to hover high enough to avoid. It can't jump as high as the Springer from level ground. So, you'll still need to gradually climb a wall or something tall and AFK there. You won't be able to say "just leave me alone" everywhere, only in specific terrain

[My reaction to this skyscale fiasco- no my reaction to this whole episode at this point](https://giphy.com/gifs/umxK4GgAxiUla)
---
More so for returning players.
---
&gt; Skyscale time-gating is a symptom of how content and achievement light the new map &amp; episode are. 
---
I'm just going to post the thread I was writing here because we don't need a multitude of threads on the same subject. 
---
Several weeks ago as we were beginning to get a glimpse at the Skyscale many of my friends were elated.  They were in a mood that I can only really summarize as, **"Heck yeah, Skyscale!"**  I was skeptical.  I get good value out of other mounts like the Jackal, Springer &amp; Griffin.  Dragonfall puts a lot of the prior mounts to great use whilst simultaneously being a playground for the Skyscale.  
---
The thing is, it's impossible for me to get a sense for whether I even really *like* the Skyscale.  Why?  One word: **Masteries.**  If ArenaNet wants to lock the Skyscale behind a huge, time-gated collection.  *Fine, be that way*.  However, considering upgrading the Rent-A-Scales.  I strongly dislike not being able to see what my time is buying me into; and that's my main problem with such a huge investment.  
---
It's both an inability to "Try before buy," and "Try before fly," and I wish I could laugh about it a little more, but I genuinely feel bad for people that don't have the time or the patience to sink into such an extensive and unnecessarily robust collection.  Sure, the Skyscale may be an "optional," feature of the War Eternal, but it was the defining feature that players were being sold on.  
---
It's going to be weeks before most people have a Skyscale.  Perhaps that's their intent.  I wish I could feel better about being given the privilege to start working on the Skyscale collection.  However, there really isn't all that much else to do, and even in-spite of beginning progression on the collections, you have nothing to show for it? It'd be nice if we could simultaneously train the Skyscale Masteries whilst working on the collection and being able to use them on the rental Skyscales.  
---
The other facet of the Skyscale dilemma is that War Eternal is a remarkably content and achievement light patch.  All of the prior LS4 episodes have had an achievement denominator of around 30 or higher.  For example, "A Star to Guide us," has a requirement of 38 achievements.  Contrasting with the achievement denominator for, "War Eternal," is a meager 18 achievements.  After a single day I have 10/18.  The story and the meta-event are well-done, there really isn't any real disputing of that; the cutscenes and the map design are well thought out.  Dragonfall is a mini LS4 version of Dragon's Stand's fight with Mordremoth as Dragonfall is for Kralkatorrik.  It's a cool parallel of the Silverwastes, Verdant Brink/Drytop, Auric basin, and well, Dragon's Stand!  
---
None the less, the main issue I have with "War Eternal," and "Dragonfall," is that it is metacentric to a fault.   All the LS3/LS4 and PoF masteries serve to do is provide an enormous, often single-minded focus on the scavenger hunt for the Skyscales.  Despite the fact that GW2 has finally made a return to areas like the Underworld, the Fissure of Woe/Burning forest or the "Lost Domain of Melandru" -- there's virtually zero lore.  The extent that this release has lore is listening to NPC's ramble on about how they feel about barren wastelands or the lack of mother nature.  
---
If you're not working on the Skyscale, the reality is that other than exploring, there really isn't a whole lot to find here.  I'm not generally the type that burns through content or makes an effort to hunt achievements.  I have 14 achievements in "a Star to Guide us," for example.  Yet, I've almost unlocked the new armor set although I feel like burning bridges rather than building them - gloves off.  The last thing I want to do on Dragonfall is build bridges for the next 3 weeks.  Get real. 
---
ArenaNet could have put some extra focus on lore/collectibles, titles, events or dialogue, but they didn't.  The map is beautiful and really does inspire the imagination.  That one shot of Lyssa/Dwayna on the front-page yesterday? I totally want that as a login screen, 100%.  I even tried kneeling at one of the statues like in Path of Fire, but no dice.  The conclusion that I've arrived at is that while "War Eternal," has a cool story, an engaging meta and an iconic mount that ArenaNet inadvertently sabotaged the skyscale collection -- it's needlessly long, light on unrelated achievements and most people have better things to do with their time.
---
you know, it's hilarious to see how this turned out. as someone who got downvoted to hell and back before the episodes release, now to see it the other way around
---
and there are plenty in Dragonfall
---
Not if you do them in wvw, and mix them with vista viewer or the gathering daily in PvE if the third WvW is a time consuming one.  Most days you can do 2 of them in 5 - 10 minutes easy.
---
I see absolutely nothing wrong with time-gating collections behind world bosses that spawn once every two hours.
---
But I dOn'T wAnT tO GeT aLL 50 apPLeS tO thAT gUy iN EmBEr bAY aLL At oNcE bY rUNnInG bEtwEEn HiM aNd tHe aPpLEs 50 tImEs!
---
This is what this reminds me of. Back then, ANet designed a long-term achievement that was very repetitive but didn't include any hard time-gates. There not being any hard timegates and all, everyone rushed to do it in a day and complained that it was the shittiest thing ever.
---
Well, no shit! It was obviously never designed to be played that way, you'd realise that if you simply read the bloody achievement text and saw that you had to do it 50 times. If you instead just played the map for a month or two and took one single apple to the guy every time you did content near that southern island, you'd get the achievement at a nice pace without any long repetitive grinding and you'd have a tiny bit of extra content each time you did the heart in the region. (And if memory serves me right, doing the heart also unlocks the mesmer portal from the story, which gets you high up the volcano so that you can just glide toward that apple guy instead of actually scaling the mountain.)
---
I don't think pussying out and not complaining is going to help the game improve, if people never complained about things in gw2 then it wouldn't be a great game as it is now. Many people love this game and want it see it do well, so they have every right to give criticism as that is healthy for any game. Also the devs do look at criticism on reddit and there forums which is rare for company's to do. Just think back to the first mount licence, people did not want gw2 to turn into the EA loot box mess and Anet agreed.
---
Not sure if you mean from the reward track or other means.. but it comes with a recipe to craft the others..
---
The meta is great and still populated, its acctually not a pisspoor easy meta aswell thats why j love it so much :D
---
I dont get the complaint the content we have been getting for a year was absolutly free if you were there in time and played regulary.
---
Why expect that you come back after a hiatus in an mmo and everything is doable without putting a little money down? They have to make money someway, other mmos offer expansions or abos.
---
Its even possible to trade gold for it.
---
YOU WILL SURELY GET THE ~~KARKLAND~~ SKYSCALE
---
Absolute garbage story and im really loving the increased aggro range from the mobs and the fun time gaited , grindy collections. Anyone would think you didn;t have layoffs a few months ago.
---
“Long term engagement” lmao. I immediately logged out once I saw what this mount required. I can’t be bothered.  Going to probably retire the game for another extended break, cause let’s be serious this episode is so low effort.
---
As a support chrono you can run your armor/weapons/back from the dps variant and only swap out the rings to diviner and the amulet to diviner and, if you feel better with it, a accessory to diviner.
---
Rest berserker.
---
Rings/accessories and amulets with berserker stats can be purchased via lws4 maps
---
For a support chrono you cant go without a shield since it's a major CC and boon increase
---
I wouldn't say *worst* thing, but it's definitely not one of the better things to do. That's why even though my initial reaction to the timegate was shock and a little bitterness, I still acknowledge their decision as **their decision**. ANet putting such a timegate behind the mount can't be called "wrong". It may not be what **you** wanted, but it's what they ran with.
---
So again, if it's really that big of a deal to you, just don't play it. Or just don't get the mount. Oh, you feel like now certain things are "locked out" of content just cuz you don't feel inclined to complete (what is to you) a ridiculous timegate? Boohoo, I've been "locked out" of every legendary weapon, armor piece, and trinket since I started playing. The difference is I accept it as my choice and don't attempt to tell the devs how bad or wrong their game is while I'm still actively playing it. Drop the entitlement, seriously..
---
WTF Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Well... it's time gated in the sense that some of the events you need to do might have a long cooldown...
---
I might stop skyscale hunting and start making grow lamps!
---
The MOMENT reset rolled around people were storming the servers to get started again. A massive amount of people going to one place + ANET's notoriously iffy servers = kaboom.
---
[I knew this would come in handy one day](https://imgur.com/a/TnVq9Ms)
---
That's a weird term to use then after All Or Nothing had us and Aurene fight an Aurene doppelgänger, mirroring the ascension ritual at Augury Rock, and had Glint specifically mention Ascension to Aurene. (Capital A Ascension, at least according to the wiki.)
---
Criticism, sure. But we've had like 5 separate threads whining about this same subject in the past 24 hours; any hint ANet was going to get has been well received already. Plus it makes it hard to take people seriously when they rant and rave about how something is so ridiculous and unreasonable while they are still actively opting to do the collections.
---
I love Taimi and Gorrik arguing over "Glory" as a collective noun for a group of dragons. Not going to lie, right as I had the thought "huh, so that's what we're calling the herd."
---
You are getting a mount if I recall correctly.
---
Can support; when to Brisban around the Triforge(?) waypoint and rubbed some NPCs... only for them to run back to their untimely demise.
---
Community complains about LW having too little content, but also complains when stuff is time gated. Just gotta accept one.
---
“Congratulations! The community unlocked the next reward tier, 12 more time gated days of collections!”
---
pvp full of bots  
---
wvw is dead  
---
pve is all about timegated collections
---
idk why, feels like something maybe ncsoft wanted. It really did seem like anet was getting good on over-using timegates. i get that this is the last big living world season 4 reward, but timegates are worse than how long the griffon quest was. i would rather pay 50g for the mount plus as much collections as the griffon, could at least still one night it
---
&gt; feel like all we're waiting for is the privilege to buy skins for the skyscale
---
That's a great way to put it. The hype is over for me now though. I don't plan on purchasing any skins for this mount anymore.
---
the infusion part is all over tyria, a few locations i'd never seen before, so it was somewhat entertaining imo. but yeah sickly &amp; eggs was too repetitive, many repeat spots like he said :\
---
Memoires
---
Ugh, seriously... just put a level 80 restriction on the cash shop item (like the normal one has), and give us back our map keys, problem solved. 
---
Not that hard to figure out a fix, why are they ruining it for everyone else.
---
As of now, its really unfair to the rest of the players who are legit map completing.
---
Except that Skyscale is an OPTIONAL mount, so it will not be required for any content. It's only required in Dragonfall where you can use it for free.
---
I understand, but in no way is the mount required. As in, any content can be done WITHOUT that mount. So it being an overarching LW4 reward doesn't mean that anyone without it is at a disadvantage. 
---
Look at it this way. ALL content before Dragonfall was made without Skyscale in mind, so it can all be done without fancy Skyscale masteries.
---
Dragonfall was made with Skyscale in mind, but all the MAIN content can be done without fully mastered Skyscale. 
---
Optional content and some QoL require Skyscale mastery, but they're trivial in magnitude and don't provide any advantage to players with Skyscale.
---
So any non-optional content that needs Skyscale to complete can be completed either with a free Skyscale or a combination of other mounts. So no, in no way is Skyscale a MUST HAVE. Also Anet made all LW4 free to unlock during weeks leading up to the release.
---
You started multiple times in your original post that it was "wrong" and "bad". Not that **you felt** that it was, but that it **was**.
---
For one, no idea where you're getting an "ego" from, seems like a random toss. Secondly, listing 20 reasons why things should be easier for you to achieve, even if they aren't "handed to you", is essentially saying you feel enrolled to more content per pay hour than you are currently receiving.
---
I'm not against you as a person. If anything I'm showing you that there are more options than just whining online hopping against hope that your two words will mean more than your two hours spent playing to the company making the calls.
---
Talk is cheap; if you really don't like something, stop giving them your time and money. If they really want your business, doing that will make them change things way faster than a 10th QQ party on reddit will.
---
Inb4 a response after "blocking"
---
Im making lamps and selling them because Id rahter have gold. I dont have time for the masteries rn, so I'll just make a new batch of quartz and ill have enough by the time I'll have the time to actually do it.
---
U could have crafted it two minutes after the patch, I don't get what's your point.
---
even the mount is useless and doesnt worth all this work
---
I got exordium on day 1, I dont see anyone with the mount yet
---
:^)
---
How is it crazy though, the price still is less then the Griffen?
---
 ... did Aurora have a pile of timegates? I don't recall.
---
On the other hand henge had multiple collections as well and took a bunch(16 IIRC) of days
---
You are completely mistaking the point. Gates arent about YOU getting more content, they are about statistics. About getting more players to log in over a longer period, to expose them longer to gemshop. Anets variant of timegating everything is just the most casual friendly variant. Adding tons of grinding would have a similar effect, but is less casual friendly. 
---
Btw, "artificial" is already overused, and theres no "natural padding" anyway.
---
Okay, I could have been more precise and added "buy to play - with liveservice", but I kinda thought that would be a given since we are talking about anet here.
---
And no, timegates are very casual friendly. I dont think you really know what grind gates are... a hint... RNG has a big role to play in those. Timegates are predictable, the amount of effort put into them is clearly defined.
---
Casual friendly does NOT mean everything is handed out to everyone equally and very little effort. Casual friendly just means that the game is designed in a way that the amount of curtained off content - or horizontal progression - is kept to a bare minimum. What does it matter if you only get the skyscale in a few months? Nothing. Theres no content limited just to the skyscale.
---
i only meant to add my angle to what you already mentioned, it wasn't intended as criticism
---
Than ignore it. You don't need it
---
Btw PvP armor is time gated at atleast 3 seasons, 8 weeks + 2 weeks break x 3.
---
Just defending dulfy’s time off. Slow down.
---
That would explain a lot, especially why all the Elder Dragons we've encountered have been "evil." Although, I'm not sure if that explains why they were supposedly like that during even the last dragonrise, unless I've got my timeline extremely wrong.
---
but i need my spirit shards and the damn thing blocks the exp progresses for all of PoF content
---
Silverwastes are still a big one. Istan just doesn't let you do it again and again and again anymore, but it's still strong for a one time a day deal, so many people just jump between meta events instead.
---
The new map might have some good rewards, I believe the meta is repeatable for loot
---
Once you get there you can use each point multiple times.
---
"I deserve this."
---
He should be a whiny kid because he doesnt get instant gratification? What?
---
If thats what you meant to say, you should have said that.
---
You had to complete the druidstone backpack collection. That's a good timegate already.
---
Time for summer vacation update!
---
Yeah, that's true and for core tyria. I meant that it's too bad that for the same character in PoF and LWS4 maps.
---
Nah the thing she wanted to share with us was when she turned into a giant glowing crystalline dragon and everyone looked at her and smiled and then she flew off into space. 
---
LW S5 space adventure
---
thats the only time gate i can think of in ffxiv tbh lmao i mean yea some currencies are time gated but those currencies are obtainable by world bosses which in gw2 are completely useless all around
---
😉
---
That's not the figure NCSOFT cares about.
---
I don’t get this sort of comment. I don’t know your playing times, but I imagine you’d be logging to do *stuff* if there was no mount, so what’s the difference?  Just make doing some steps towards the mount part of the stuff you’d do anyway. It’s not like it’s going anywhere or is a limited time only special.
---
Dungeons (well, fractals) and raids are very fun, at least to me. Don't get to do them all that much any more because I have no team these days, but that stuff is more interesting in gw2 than other MMOs, at least to me.
---
PvP isn't as popular, but I still enjoy it. Conquest queues are short. WvW usually has something kicking around at all hours of the day. Enjoyable, just don't burn yourself out.
---
This. HoT is critical story-wise to go first. &gt;_&lt;
---
Remember how we were speculating the skyscale would be a part of the story because it would probably play into the story of defeating Kralk, since *our own dragon was dead?*
---
Remember how the story and the map were so monumentally glossed over due to spoilers that the only thing they could focus on in the previews was the legendary and the new mount?
---
Remember how ANet doesn't let things cross over between episodes, let alone seasons, because it betrays the "fairness" of their episodic releases and their purchase model?
---
Remember how the time-gating on the Wayfarer's Henge (ascended backpack collection in Draconis Mons) was too heavily timegated so ANet made it *five times* faster for the sake of the players?
---
It's like none of these things mattered when making the decisions for this collection.
---
What I find god-awful in the movie were the lack of respect to the MCU continuity and the writing for Carol Danvers's character. I thought the only thing that made the character tolerable was Brie Larson's acting.
---
Did you seriously just call this game Grindy...?
---
Holy shit.
---
What if they had limited the acqusition to the first 3 collections and nested those collections within the story at the point where the skyscales were discovered? The first time you encounter them (probably on your way from the Melandru area to the Olmakhan base and noticing a PoI) they kinda snarl at you and refuse to let you on. And then you just kinda..wrangle one and make it eat volatile magic? Having those collections become a part of the story would make sense in gaining their trust. Heck, even if it involves doing 10 events in each lane to buy from the merchants, I think it would go over better than what we’re dealing with now.
---
Oh boy, you don't even know what you have started...
---
I would carefully say there is at least some divide which one is the "best".
---
Since that therm is very relative to what situation you got yourself in. And it's subjective as heck.
---
If you have the lvl80 booster you can do some class trails in pve https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Level-80_Boost
---
IMHO you prolly should run power dmg builds, those feel the most like plowing through mobs.
---
Reaper - HoT necro elite is a safe bet, tanky and you get essential dps enhancing boons for yourself easily, it has plenty of cleave dmg too
---
Dragon hunter - HoT guard, also quite bursty and fun to play, highly appreciated in pve endcontet (raids, fractals)
---
Revenant - actually no elite needed, I played rev since release for about more than 1k hrs mostly with elite specs, but recently I was leveling a second one and staying on devastation, invocation, retribution(actually no idea how that line is called, but it's the dwarf enhancing one)
---
Plenty of dmg cleave and single target to feel badass, quite a lot of self sustain (passive heal and stuff) and mobility...
---
Soulbeast might also be fun, but imo it's hella clunky and 2 high dmg skills get interrupted when you move, which is annoying in open world and when you have to move around, but it is also quite fun and deadly.
---
Wait.. is it REALLY GONNA TAKE 3 MONTHS to get Skyscale!?
---
everyone's so impatient nowdays. I usually even wait a week to do the story so I don't have to deal with the bugs.
---
Daredevil, never stop flipping
---
to boost your amount of unused shards from 10k to 20k?
---
They probably moved the WH devs over to the failed mobile game long ago, so they weren’t in the loop when the Skyscale devs made the same mistake.
---
I would take me an hour to reinstall but I want to do it when I reformat my PC so...
---
was a bit short on time so let me elaborate.
---
what makes you think kralk's mother is another dragon and not some weird magical concept beyond human understanding (or some nonsense).
---
what if his mom is "the random atom splitting of the universe" as you put it
---
Same, I’m very selective what I spend time on and never do things that aren’t fun anymore, no matter what the carrot... er reward.
---
I must be old school and used to the original Mawdrey collection and whatnot but that honestly doesn't seem like a big deal. I really don't undestand what the outrage is about. Less than a month of very casual friendly grind to get a new mount entirely with in-game play seems completely reasonable.
---
Day 2 and 1 for that matter is ridiculous, thank you  [u/tgdm](https://www.reddit.com/user/tgdm/) for the compiling these lists of warnings.
---
I didn't want to include more than a few examples for time gates, I just needed enough to show the ratio for effort and reward when it comes to it.
---
Time-gates add no gameplay value other than patience and dedication, and with the sheer size of the collection, that is null and void and becomes a nuisance. 
---
It's more of a, if you're going to time-gate, don't do it on such a massive scale for such a minor thing like a mount with this big of a collection.
---
22 days is really not a big deal for casually grinding out something like this. Especially when the game HAS NO SUB FEE. It's not like you need to spend hours every day working on it.
---
I see. This one never caught on for me. One time I got some blasts, there didn't seem to be any wall targets :x
---
I really dont get all the weeping about exp and spirit shards.. dont you guys already have enough of these useless things in your wallet? I certainly do..
---
For me to be able to purchase Skyscale medicine stuff, do I have to do 10 events in one day? Does that count reset? Or can I do events at my leisure and eventually I get there?
---
&gt; Time gating is a lazy and stupid mechanic.
---
It's a game without a monthly sub. Time gating is allowed. It's how they get people to come back and engage with the game on a daily basis.
---
It is a trivial amount of time for a typical MMO grind, and it's nothing new for ANet. This is the exact same timegate that Mawdrey had (even using the same fucking items).
---
There used to be a ressing Daily achievement in the game too
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Right on. That sounds good. I’ll have to hunt down a Fractal group. Anything I should do to prepare? I have  a lvl 80 and a couple of boosts, but haven’t played since launch when I leveled up my Elementalist.
---
TBF Caithe actually spent more time with her than we did.
---
You don't need to hardcore raid for the legendary armor. However, if you don't clear w1-4 every week it will take longer. If that's ok with you you can only clear easy bosses and do the harder ones only once for the achivment.
---
pls no i have like 55 teleport to friends in my bank and i want to use them now
---
Ooooh. Ok. I see where the wires crossed a little. 
---
I don’t have a thought one way or another on what type of being “Mother” would refer to, other than a sentient something or other capable of interacting with, at the very least, the Mists. 
---
What that being is could be an earth worm for all I know, but the familiarity that (at least Kralk) showed was enough for at least me to assume it’s not a force of nature/random splitting.
---
The term mother is one of... family if not endearment. Otherwise even “creator” would have been more appropriate in my eyes.
---
I really recommend any one of the lanes in Dragon's Stand for this. I got it in like 15 minutes max.
---
I have hundreds actually
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with a map-spanning collection, but I also feel like they really advertised it as if it was just part of this episode. Also including things from LS3 is definitely an issue, thats a completely different part of the game and I'm sure there's plenty of people playing LS4 who don't have it unlocked at all.
---
I'm okay with there being a repetitive collection that gets a little grindy and boring, that we could see what needed to be done in front of us.  But to finish that collection to then have to wait for reset to find we have double what we've already done yet to do....that's a dick move Anet.  It's a mount, not a legendary.  If you want it to be a legendary mount, then it had better be spectacular.   This is cool, but it's not spectacular.
---
To be fair Anet doesn't control the market directly. It's more of a free market system - players control the prices depending on supply and demand. The demand skyrocketed, so the price skyrocketed too.  
---
I hope it goes down though, I was pretty sure I didn't remember it being 80g when I made Mawdrey after all and that was just last year..
---
What happened in Got isnt bad, the execution is bad. And war eternal beginning is as bad to be honest. Aurene's death is a pointless gimmick now, especially if you play these episodes back to back it seems like nothing happened.
---
 **Unpopular opinion** : those you defend this have their head stuck in anets butt.
---
btw. first argument from you. because its SUB free timegating content doesnt make any sence at all.
---
I don’t understand this post
---
Depends on how old installation you have. But yeah a few GB most likely. I know when game was 27GB and i reinstalled it from mine that was 30GB+.
---
But you are whining now, in multiple paragraphs. You and them are the same :)
---
Funny thought but from your perspective it would be same days of playing than us so don't make it a big thing
---
&gt;griffon is clunky
---
You seriously just need to get good.
---
At the time of release, there was no way of acquiring ascended armor by buying timegated mats, which was my point. And much like legendaries, this mount (as others have pointed out) does nothing unique, you could call it "just a skin" with "kind of legendary value", sort of like how the Griffin is. You have a griffin? Wow you spent a lot of gold and time doing the collection! You have a legendary? Wow you spent a lot of gold and time doing it. And same thing with the skyscale.
---
I'm fine with the collection, but don't hide it behind layered collections.  It seems a little sneaky and deceptive.  That's the part that's bugging me.
---
Players will log in as often as they want to, with the limit being how often they can. Some players just can't log in every day and adding a time gate won't give them more time in their IRL lives to log in and do daily collections.

Look at this post ( [https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bp6quf/i\_can\_only\_play\_saturdays/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bp6quf/i_can_only_play_saturdays/) ), this guy can only play one day a week. Even if he played 24 hours from one reset period to the next, it'd still take months for him to unlock it, while players who only play 30 mins a day can have it in a week or so.
---
I, myself, already play several hours everyday and have been doing things like fractals and the new meta, but I'm still way behind on the collection because I missed the daily reset window.
---
And besides, they've been working on new event weeks to fill in the gaps and bring players back into the game for a week or so, like the No Downed State week in WvW and the World Boss event in PvE.
---
And its not even about getting everything right away, you still have to do the collection whether its daily gated or not, the time gate does not extend or decrease the amount of time you have to put in in order to get it, it just limits how often you CAN put in that time.
---
Well it's a good thing I've been mining/hoarding charged crystals for like 3 years.
---
On release, you could not circumvent the timegate of ascended gear. Much like any wealthy player can do now, they can just purchase the Grow Lamp or Charged Quartz Crystals no problem, but if we imagine a player who does not have access to the marketboard, the grind is similarly tedious and gated.
---
&gt; And it's not, like... hours of grinding every day for three weeks either. 
---
That is the problem, I would not complain if the collection itself takes time because of the things you have to do, some people will be faster and some will be slower but the way anet did this you have smaller task which take longer because the want that it takes a minimum time and that is called stretching content so that is feels more
---
They knew the content they delivered was pretty thin, so they need to stretch out the only interesting thing this episode.
---
Hot damn, time to liquidate all my extra charged quartz.
---
Sunstone lumps gone from minimum price to &gt;40s too.  Oh look. People have bought out the entire supply...
---
&gt; mystic forge
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; charged quartz, bloodstone dust, ecto, and red meat. &gt;TP'able.
---
&gt;TP'able.
---
thank fucking christ
---
imagine if anet actually put it behind a 10 day timegate.
---
Pls explain to me this charged quartz crystal thing.
---
Fair, seeing everything at once would've been nice.
---
You can literally see from the new achievements that they just implemented last minute stuff to pad it out. Kill a 1000 mobs three times? Use X item 100 times, do X event 25 times? But barely any real achievements/story achievements? It's so lazy and obvious.
---
I’m on oce or there wouldn’t be a problem, I have a lot of play time from university so they were the good times. Many a legendary and endless hours of farming!
---
Skritts on this map are really strong.
---
Maybe from pulling the stone on  Thunderhead Peaks Nord Meta ;-)
---
Shut up! Shut up! I also want my free legendary armor, now! Why is Anet forcing me to grind for good gear and then participating in Raids to get it? Don't they know I have PTSD, social anxiety and can play only 20 minutes once in a month? It's anti-consumer, breaks geneva conventions and a generally a crime against humanity.
---
You're not entirely wrong, though the timegating is still beyond stupid.
---
You rich you know
---
How is this tonic called? Is it Endless? Where can I aquire it?
---
But...why does it make such a big difference to wait 30 minutes or even an hour and come back after the initial rush? Why join the rush and get it done right away? It doesnt change the time that it resets, and people have been populating the maps all day. Do it at your own time, forget the rush and face no server instability. Win win.
---
One location is right when you walk into the Melandru part of the map.
---
All of Season 4.
---
In terms of short term gains? I agree with you. Long term gains? Not so much. The game has sorely been lacking some good in game rewards that you can’t just buy with a credit card. Rewards like the skyscale is improving the reward structure in the game, and it’s catering to a part of the player base that has been slowly dying. Keeping these players in the game could mean long term gains as you have more active players engaging the game, potentially using the gemstore.
---
ya 1 charged quartz per feed :\
---
&gt; we know it predates Zhaitan's death as the Torment's mentality is exact what is presented in Edge of Destiny
---
Got a quote for that? If there is an exact match I might have missed it or it got lost in translation.

I remember that i could never scroll in the panel.
---
You read ^^my ^^^thesis?
---
I ran out of those
---
Well, yeah, I'm aware. It doesn't change the fact that I don't like it, but I understand why is it so. Still would have liked to hear opinions of priests from Divinity Reach about gods leaving.
---
https://youtu.be/jStbqLNtlxs this is probably the fastest rotation to finish the map.
---
in other words, they have removed temporarily the main reason to do a map completion.
---
Charged quartz, ecto, bloodstone, meat in forge. You need 12 feedings in total andcando only three per day
---
Truer words have never been spoken.
---
Oh no. :)
---
that was more of a kill or be killed situation
---
Haven't needed anything in living story season 3 and the season 2 stuff is just in the drytop and silverwastes zones which everyone has. The one option in bitterfrost is an alternative to the Frostgorge Sound Jormag fight.
---
I tried it solo / in a duo but I seem to be having trouble tracking it. If you restart the instance in the flight section before breaking his wing off it resets you to the part where you're flying across both wings and the achievement tracker disappears once that part ends (but before you cut the wing). I did not get credit in it. If you don't reset the instance, it shows all the way up to the end/loading screen.
---
Does it pop when you get it? Or do you have to complete? It's kind of a pita to reset it.
---
Uhhh, pick up agony resist if you plan on going higher in fractals. Wiki's got tons of info if you wanna poke around. Be sure to check around and make sure your gear/build isn't too wonky either.
---
Don't let rude pugs get you down either.
---
Oh hell, no one spoke about that and just kept saying it was broken.
---
I was kind of okay with it being like do one collection a day for 5 of them. But now what the fuck this is too much.
---
https://i.imgur.com/bNmAd3j.png Time to make some gold.
---
I'd like to present my counter argument:
---
Go fuck yourself, OP.
---
Actually, plenty of people can play for a limited time a week. If u play on one day weekly then it will take you more than a month probably. And thats considering if further stages are not aimilar to feeding one.
---
Strictly speaking you only need PoF and this episode which is free. Every item needed up to now can be purchased on TP. A different matter is that having other things makes it easier, which is a very valid choice by anet to promote old content.
---
Is Kormir ever useful or right?
---
A certain animation comes to mind...
---
Got the same problem, ist there a way to get it running? Gw2 feels so wrong without arcdps and buildtemplates.
---
&gt;It's more of a, if you're going to time-gate, don't do it on such a massive scale for such a minor thing like a mount with this big of a collection.
---
Well we can use the mount on the new map, the collection /time gate only prevents us from :
---
- using it on other maps right away
---
- unlocking Masteries right away
---
- leaving the game for 3 month since we finished the new content in a few days
---
I know we live in a fast world and everyone wants their shinies right away, but then those only engaged in new stuff / achievements come for a few days and that's it *insert "dead game" meme*
---
So while I'm totally okay with some time gated stuff to keep the game alive, why the sky scale? Sure we want and we won't it now, but it's basically content we don't need (at least atm), it's some QoL and gimmick. Sure it seems harsh to lock away something we don't desperately need in the first place, but what would be a better choice :
---
- timegate the story so you miss out on the epicness of this Finale because you can't afford to play more than once a week? 
---
- timegate a mount which you are already able to use on the map it was designed for in the first place?
---
Anet proves once again they can't design shit
---
A mount is a bit more than a bit of cosmetics and stat swapping(that is also achievable through other means).
---
It tracks your event progress as an achievement , so you can do the events without worrying anything.
---
Im Rich you know
---
Where is the "yes, but begrudgingly" option? thank
---
You don't seem to understand the issue at all...
---
It's not about the grind or the difficulty, it's about not letting your players do it in one go if they wish to do so.
---
It's about prolongating unnecessarily the journey to inject it with a fake sense of progression by locking them out of the content you hyped them about. It's about not rewarding the players who are willing to go hard.
---
They'll probably whack renegade later for trade off reasons.
---
Just wait until 90% of the playerbase reach the "I now need to do a 5 second action once a day for 10 days or spend hundreds gold on a jacked-up Grow Lamp" stage.
---
That's when the riots will start.
---
This!
---
Anet should not listen to this crying baby's
---
They don't want a chaoschrono 2.0
---
Also, while not to 10 ppl, a heal herald with ventari could give alacrity aswell
---
Curse, you mean.
---
yo we dont play nigga
---
So people who got in on day one before reset not only get it a day earlier, they get in before the horde of players spikes the price of a grow lamp as the majority of players reach it? Just lul.
---
Yeah i am dropping Skyscale until mat prices drop and there is a decent guide for it.
---
I think the best way to look at is that in the schrm of the story it's not the death that's important, it's that it facilitates her personal growth through her rebirth. As she herself says in the final instance it imparted her with a great deal of courage. Honestly without the multi month wait and the weird overfocus on her death in multimedia this will likely be more apparent. But I know not everyone will agree with me on that
---
So when I first got to Dragonfall I did my normal map exploration to get a feel for things. I saw that the Fallen Wing was accessable as a part of the map and so I climbed it. 15 minutes into the new map and I went “Ok, let’s climb that” and I did. It was really easy, especially with the number of options you are given between mounts and the vine-slinging.
---
It was only later when I got to the appropriate story step that I realized that they wanted me to climb the wing with the Skyscale. And you can climb up the inside with it if you so choose, but you don’t need to. It’s the path of most resistance. Climbing the outside with any other option is much faster and much easier. And nowhere else in the map is the skyscale really necessary from what I have found. It might make some things easier, but honestly by the time I get all these collections done I’m pretty sure I’ll have a good idea of how to get around the map without ever having to touch the rental mounts. 
---
I enjoy Dragonfall and the meta. It’s been a lot of fun, but not being able to get experience from it is just unacceptable. ANet needs to hotfix that immediately. I can accept that the skyscale is just an overly long series of scavenger hunts that I may eventually complete if I feel like it, but I will not accept having my experience bar in Elona turned off until I finish it.
---
Why you booing him, he's right.
---
By unlocking the Skyscale, I assume. No one's been able to yet afaik...
---
&gt;because the skyscale mastery is locked behind unlocking the skyscale
---
Or you know, they could actually add fun and engaging content that makes people want to log in.
---
Your wvw data is also off.
---
To get mistforged you need the regular armor first, which adds 1310 tokens or 4 weeks of timegate.
---
Generally the reason why Human areas don't look all that great is they were the first areas made for the game. Queendsale was their proof of concept and was iterated on over 700 times before launch.
---
anet can put a cap on the price if they wanted to
---
Are you sure it's "need target" and not "obstructed"? Kralk's weakspots have been a PitA in that regard every single time including these. Aurene also has a limited firing angle, not sure what the error message for that one is.
---
same issue here with new version. Buildtemplates also only load partial
---
With their history of feedback and comments, you can imagine what would happen if they say something wrong while the situation is so volatile...
---
&gt; Overall just try to hit the spots as soon as possible, and spam 1
---
Make sure to fire 3 shots before retargeting though, otherwise you just waste valuable time achieving nothing.
---
Your argument would make sense if there would be anything else to do in the game atm aside from daily fractals and raids every monday. But we're 2 days after 'major' content release and I'm already out of stuff to do.
---
you're not wrong, they just built up a hype train and then killed the mount hype in just a few days
---
I learned this two days ago and haven't stopped thinking about it since. I was scared of Jimmy Neutron as a kid, and now he's my favorite Guild Wars 2 character. Wild.
---
And when we find out your bought item might jeopardize other gem store sales. We’ll nerf the hell out of it and temporarly remove rewzrds for thousands of players.
---
Ill play 1k gold to skip it
---
Guys You are complaining when there are a lot of people , myself included that are lucky to find couple of hours a month to play the game. You will understand this when, You finish Your school and have family of Your own :)
---
buy 2k skin with an instant mount unlock
---
Yes
---
that was their plan all along
---
Well, the guild chat is about the story. So why would they talk about the skyscale mount when it isn't really that much part of the story? 
---
It would also be stupid from a PR point of view to talk about it now, rather than wait until people have calmed down a bit. Since people in general seem to have issues being constructive and civilized when upset.
---
I'll be honest I'd buy 5 just to make sure it happened!
---
Dear OP, I fully agree with you. None wants to bother with 30 day timegate for celestial, a gazillion gold cost for minstrel or any of that other BS. 
---
Allowing players to adapt their build pvp style would be perfectly fine and frankly easier to balance.
---
However, this isn't even a top 5 issue with wvw. And frankly wvw is getting beyond repair. At this point there are so many people playing low effort that actual even fights only exist when both sides set them up, away from their pugs. 
---
So many pugs absolutely hate even fights or competition that it cannot exist. Which means wvw is now officially eotm ktrain 2.0.
---
It was a crafted item used in the production of mawdry.
---
oof, its 6 gold right now when most of the people are on step 2
---
Do you think it'll rise or fall tommorow?
---
First I've heard of these. Do they just drop from event chests or the new meta?
---
If you rebound your mount abilities you have have made them interfere with the skill bar abilities
---
inhave no idea whats needed and tbh, i dont care. im still getting it
---
It that's your situation it would also take you 9 months to craft a full set of ascended armor and weapons. 
---
That's just what MMOs are about, man.
---
Go click on rocks and trees on Runescape. Surely that type of slow grinding is more up your alley.
---
?
---
Well, nice to hear :)
---
About servers: when you play PvE, there is one giant megaserver for EU and one for NA (and one separated game server for china). 
---
When it comes to WvW, those servers (or we better call them homeworlds) matter.
---
I laughed too hard at this
---
And where was that made clear in the advertising? Oh, it wasn't... That's the biggest problem, making it an elite endgame mount is fine in itself, but then don't advertise it as just another new mount. Make it clear this requires a lot of work in advance. Saves a lot of people from getting over excited and then hitting a grindwall they simply cannot climb.
---
because blatant cashgrabs aren't cool so they're mutually exclusive
---
I find staff a lot more fun personally, but scepter might be closer to meta for endgame content. But like... staff is a ton of fun for open world. (I main a staff tempest and I'm very biased but. Still.)
---
True, but it's a poor business that doesn't try to make money. And frankly I love playing this game, I'd rather they had money and I can keep playing than fail and I can't.
---
There are plenty of these. I’m of the opinion that rng-only drops shouldn’t be account bound.
---
There's a timegate (daily reset), inside a timegate (hatchlings need 12 food and can only be fed 3 times a day), INSIDE a timegate (hatcling food needs charged quartz that you can only craft 1 per day) INSIDE A TIMEGATE (you need 10 additional charged quartz for a grow lamp)
---
How many levels of timegate are we on
---
I honestly wonder what those that complain have better to do in game? I mean, apparently a LW episode is only 2 hours of content. You want so desperately go back to afking in LA and wait 3-5 months for another 2 hours of content?
---
I actually didn't play during that time but at least *that* could be fixed by just killing Vale Guardian once.
---
This is why they did it pre-launch. No need to face the backlash on stream
---
You need the HoT expansion to unlock gliding!
---
Since you've already used your level 80 booster I recommend you to play the first PoF story to unlock your raptor. The story won't make a lot of sense but at least you have a mount. Then you can go back to Core Tyria and start your personal story etc. The mount makes traveling a lot faster.
---
However I've played GW2 since 2012 and didn't get PoF till late 2018 so I personally played my entire story and 100% map completion of Core Tyria without mounts and that's overall also a nice experience to consider.
---
i suck at economics, but grow lamp price was still increasing last i checked, so i'd guess food will too :V
---
Its called [Endless Shadow Warrior Tonic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Shadow_Warrior_Tonic) which you can get from the volatile magic vendor just west of the Pact Command Waypoint \^\^  
---
To unlock the vendor you need to do 10 events in the burning forest area :)
---
In my case it didn't seem that my movement did that much to avoid the things that you should avoid. As soon as I saw them I pushed the opposite direction and I still got hit. I did reset at the latest checkpoint but made it through without further problems.
---
Though, the 2nd ability worked for me with any issues.
---
Hitboxes too large? not enough time to evade? the movement to evade is too short.
---
I don't know, it didn't bother me that much since I did not see an achievement for this (only to destroy 10 weak points).
---
Yes the quartz is another problem, but at least you can buy the lamp and the food on the tp..well if you have enough money
---
Right. But Skyscale is only an option. Those mounts we needed for story and exploration were given us for doing one easy heart-task. We don't need that mount. Legendary weapons are also optional to do.
---
There has to be something for endgame players. Also, why would you skip so many episodes and just do the most recent one? I don't understand your logic. Not everything has to be noob friendly, there has to be some sort of challenge in pve.
---
But waiting is not playing
---
it costs 140 gold to buy the lamp + enough food off the the trading post.
---
At least the griffon was upfront with its own gold cost.
---
&gt;There is nothing wrong with the collection itself
---
Hard disagree. The collection is nothing but grind and timegates. It's the kind of shit you see from sub based MMOs that need to keep a player spinning their wheels so they can keep grifting the player for sub money while giving the bare minimum of content back in return. Compare this collection with something like Knight of the Thorn which had a few small collections but was coupled with some interesting fights, lore and wasn't overly protracted or timegated. That, to me, is how you do collection quests right. This, on the other hand, is just pure gating for the sake of gating. Not a fan.
---
PuRiTy Of PuRpOsE
---
How many we need in total ?
---
Thank you for helping to clarify it - I get very overwhelmed trying to make sense of things like that. 3 days behind isn't too bad, I can deal with that better than having to dump 70g for a grow lamp instead.
---
She took Kralk's place. That was the whole plan all along.
---
I'm not talking about Quartz crystal.
---
If you're doing absolutely everything from scratch, sure.
---
 There's a fine line between a time-gated collection that doesn't feel like it's time-gated because it intrinsically takes a while as there's a lot to do, and a time-gated collection that feels like it's time-gated because the game literally tells you "no, you gotta wait now, come back later".
---
Example: the collections to get elite specialization weapons. I didn't mind doing them. Sure, some were bothersome here and there. But I was partaking in a lot of things and events as I did so, all over Elona. So in the end, it was okay. Now look at this collection, where most of the time you just go to a location and press F, until the game tells you you've done enough for today and should come back later. This is completely different both in design and the way it feels doing it. That's what's pointed at and what is fundamentally bad, that's what is being pointed at and that's what the outrage is about. Just a cheap, lame way to coerce the player into logging in.
---
&gt;You started multiple times in your original post that it was "wrong" and "bad". Not that you felt that it was, but that it was.
---
Everything a person says is their personal opinion. That doesn't need to be qualified.
---
Been playing PoF for a bit. I boosted a Ranger.
---
I want to get new gear. How should I go about it? Fractals, Dungeons, Raids? Should I dump my center tyria mastery into fractals and farm for them then?
---
How do you find a group to do Silverwastes? I can't find anything for that in LFG.
---
Are there worthwhile open world content besides world bosses?
---
They mentioned on the preview stream that they were planning on doing another one post-launch to get more in-depth on the mount.
---
For the millionth time, there are no culinary applications for bloodstone dust. None. NONE!
---
&gt; All of this with no clear explanation of why it's so heavily gated with so many steps
---
Patch barely has any content in it so they have to timegate what little they have to keep us logging in.
---
As a Griffin owner, I just feel the Skyscale feels useless. It is slow, clunky feeling and very limited. I will get it as it is content and never use it. 
---
Will definitely not by any skins for it.
---
they're not strapped for cash and a business doesn't have to be EA to be successful (some value customer satisfaction)
---
[Ayin](https://www.ayinmaiden.com/gw2) does youtube video guides for GW2.
---
Finally someone talking sense.
---
Chaos chrono gave quickness as well as other boons that herald cant give. It would hardly be chaoschrono 2.0.
---
Daily time gated collections I hate, but tolerate. Just learning that its even further time gated by several items which require charged quartz to craft where you can only charge 1 a day. Which potentially adds literally month(s) onto the timegate. Absolutely shocking how terrible this collection is. I work in AAA games and this is something most companies would never do. The Anet devs who pushed for this should be ashamed of themselves.
---
Same for me. I was like, fuck that shit, maby I am going to it somewhere in the future when I am really super bored and don't care about it anymore so the timegate doesn't feel chore anymore.
---
nice, time to make some money
---
we don't know, maybe we'll see next episode or during some interim stuff
---
I saw someone on one yesterday in Dragonfall - is that just a temporary version or something?
---
I'd like to say "fuck it!", but I'd also like to gain exp on PoF maps
---
Well, everyone hated Braham's story arc in Season 3. This is not comparable to GoT because of sheer scale. (NO SPOILERS) For me the GoT fanbase has become extremely cynical because "muuh brilliant ending theory didn't happen!". I am happy and can't wait for the conclusion.
---
I just wish it would say how far through you are as you complete them (I've done them and I know it's only 150 but still would be nice to know.)
---
Good idea,  I had not thought of it, thx
---
Do we have a gallery for them?
---
i have 15k spirid shars and i never used any at all,if you dont plan to spend 3 years fliping shit on tp,you will get same amount in few years.
---
Check the wardrobe in game
---
Difficult to check through a smartphone
---
Because it's pretty horrible design to lock content behind(especially to the extent they have here). Because logging on during this only reinforces their decision. I've been off of GW2 for three months or so, I won't be returning for crap like this.
---
Ugh, really? Jesus Christ, all of this for a mostly useless mount.
---
It is "teleport to party" actually, you can't just port to anyone on your FL on demand, you have to team up and can even port to ppl you aren't befriended with as long as they are in your group.
---
I'm not sure about the interaction with squads and their subgroups tho.
---
As far as I understood the story part Aurene can handle different types of magic because she was born with this property. Probalby because she came in contact with that magic before she even hatched (Mordremoth's death while the egg was still in Tarir).
---
She does have a one advantage tho . She knows now how it messed up Kralk. Now she might be able to "control it" better. While killing Kralk we went inside to "kill" him and there was his internal himself ? How Im suppose to call that ? His inner self ? So she should have one as well no ? Controling the magic within . Also now when I think about it. We killed Mordremoth's innerself , Kralk's inner self but not Zaithan's inner self o_O. Hope we didnt messed up with him
---
Then when wait till you get home?
---
Well, with mordremoth we got inside his mind, with kralk we got inside his aesophagus and destroyed his phisical heart lel.
---
Happy we didn't get the wrong exit.
---
And a lich Power could be useful too, lel
---
I know it was written somewhere . A book in a game maybe ? No clue right now. Deth and Life , Fire and Ice , Light and Darkness ? When you take that Bubbles was in deep "dark" ocean. Oh .. oh .. how about Aurene the Elder Dragon of Light. The Star to Guide us all ! :3
---
I wouldn't ask here if i weren't curious to see them now
---
Imo since you main thing atm is open world pve like map metas, bounties, and general pve stuff, I wont recommend using snow crows builds. You play with zerker stats, you could play around with gs axe/axe for solo pve, if survival is harder for specific bosses you can switch the axe offhand for a shield, and if you need a range weapon switch axe for rifle. Personally I find spellbreaker more fun to use and better survivability even on a full zerker build. Berserker specialization is better dps wise in any content but it the recent changes make you softer than before, so it will be harder to survive mobs, but nasty numbers.
---
EVEN with Nevermore you could feed the birb all stuff on one day. I'd have understand it when we had a limit there, but with this mount?
---
Yeah hope we didnt messed up with Zaithan when we didnt went inside. Maybe he is still there laying on the ground not able to move for years but still alive ? 
---
Also while doing the story right before going inside Kralk, Rhytlock said "Going inside through his mouth ?" or something like that. My quick answer was "Well then there is also other entrance on the other side if you want to go that way insted"
---
Yeah, I think so too, but I'd also love to gain some exp on PoF maps :/
---
Good point, I mean we know we are getting a ring already. But yeah I couldnt agree more.
---
It all adds up, just the end product missing. Can for sure be added at a later date though, since all the groundwork is there.
---
I hope so because I wouldnt want to go inside that xD

SW lfg are usually named "RIBA" (search for it on this subreddit). You can also make your own lfg.
---
HoT metas and Istan are decent way to get some gold. New map is also not bad.
---
Don't worry, the Priory made sure he was dead. Pretty sure a part of his tail is in their headquarters.
---
As Anduin said, other players can spam attacks constantly. That's how I got it.
---
hovering in mid air wherever you wants kinda cool too
---
I did Draconis Mons timegate grind for the ascended backpack, and tbh I didn't see the issue. Sparkly and strong stuff require some commitment to get? Fine by me.

Currently playing both ffxiv and gw2 and any time spent in ff makes gw2 more enjoyable.
---
Its Sigil of Nullification all over again.
---
Aurene's okay, but the Church of the Crystal Bloom gives me the Kool-Aid vibes.
---
Hm?
---
Welcome to Tyria, u/skelepibs!
---
After more than six years of playing, I think it's safe to say thst GW2 is my favorite MMO - possibly even favorite PC game of all time. There are so many smallish QoL things (like the wardrobe system and account wallet) that keep bringing me back to the game if I ever play something else.
---
Not to mention the community. This is by far the friendliest game community I've ever come across. As I'm sure you've noticed already, everyone just loves to help each other.
---
I truly hope you'll enjoy the game. :)
---
Anbsolutely! Why won't they let me rush through content so I can finally go back to complaining about the lack of new content?
---
Simple answer. Not many players actually do fractals, dungeons or raids. They all want the sweet new mount though.
---
Yeah, same. I am already late to starting the collections, might as well get something from them.
---
Skygated Timescale, great!
---
Fanatic deadeye player here.
---
There is a trait in Deadeye that gives you few boons after reaching full malice - swiftness, **25 stacks of might, fury**, vigor and regeneration and refreshing initiative. To keep those boons you have to lose your malice (by using a stealth attack) and reach all stacks again.
---
You die too quickly? Take **invigorating precision** in Critical Strikes. It heals you greatly for % of damage dealt. Much better than signet of malice, so you can take other heal.
---
Is Dulfy taking a break from the game? Whenever I come back to the game those guides are an invaluable go to...especially for this collection inception
---
I came back after a while and hadn't played episode 4 on... And that's exactly how I felt. Finished 5, then started the next chapter and was "oh okay". Though it was made slightly better with Brahm's "Praise Joko!" LMFAO.
---
No and or maybe.
---
I didnt do the medicine collection on tuesday. While all the players that finished that collection on tiesday had to wait a day for the next collection, i didnt because i waited 1 day and was able to do medicine and the eggs on the same day.
---
So it seems that there is a global timegate and not a personal. This slows down the ppl that want to rush the content (just to complain later that there isnt any content left) but all the less active players wont get affected.
---
No idea if it should or always works like this but id did for me.
---
It would expect a case similar to Sigil of Nullification, but not as sharp of a rise because this still has means of crafting.
---
They advertised it as being released with this patch, not as being something you get immidiatly from playing this patch alone. I mean being more clear on this part might be a good idea, I don't disagree with that at all, but given that this complaint didn't really come up with past collections of a similar design I can see how they didn't feel the necessity.
---
Good point.
---
When exactly does the Skyscale Mastery line appear in your Masteries interface, first time you log in after downloading the patch, or do you have to complete some action or achievement in game to make it appear?
---
I mean... if you’re still playing the game you might as well get it right? It doesn’t hurt Anet if you don’t.

Time-Lost Skyscale
---
And now for something completely different... Skysale - Skyscale for 4000 gems for those who don't want to be timegated with additional skin -  embellished Skyscale (Let the plebs know you didn't have to wait) XD
---
what is it listed under?
---
That'll teach em.

If you are in a Lv50 zone, most likely.

I'm reasonably certain Malyck was one if the seven thousand Mordrem the commander personally ended.

Which parts of Saving Skyscales should I focus on in terms of difficulty? 
---
By that I mean, I've heard parts are tied to PoF metas - some of which are rarely done anymore (still haven't done that Redeeming IG recording in Vabbi) - what are the ones you'd want out the way / that are tied to other player engagement, if you only had a few hours a week to play? I know about the Djinn unlock one...are there are others within the collections too?
---
And you dont expect the game to feel more dead/empty if they introduced full fletched flying mounts? It would be a terrible mistake
---
I use Beetle when I can over Raptor/Jackal. Really speeds up things.
---

I feel like part of the problem is War Eternal was advertised as including the Skyscale, so one would assume that like Long Live the Lich and the Roller Beetle, you would only need that episode (and of course content in PoF and the core game, which were required to play LLtL). Now, with little to no notice, warning, indication, or even hinting that it would require anything more than just what's required for War Eternal, we learn that it requires all five other episodes in the season (I did do some research and apparently the grow lamp recipe isn't limited to LS2 owners, although it was only useful to them, which is probably why LS2 owners, myself included, assumed it was limited). 
---
Sure, Anet did reopen the free windows over the last few months, but I feel like even then they severely overestimated how many people actually took advantage of that, and moreover, didn't even say "this will be required to get something big/the new mount in War Eternal." 
---
Plus everyone that's coming in because they heard you can now fly a dragon are not only SOL, but are hit with this terrible first impression of Anet and GW2. 
---
And what's worse is that if you have maxed out PoF masteries, you now are unable to get any xp from PoF maps until you go through a minimum of 5-12 days of timegated stuff (depending on whether you have charged quartz in storage, also add 10 days if you're not willing to or able to purchase grow lamps off the tp). So now there will be even less reason to play on PoF maps, which already have an extremely dwindling population and rarely if ever have metas and event chains complete. 
---
The most confusing part is that this episode provides just as much if not more playtime as most other episodes, and they've already got examples of both successful timegated collections/crafting and successful ways to keep players coming back for at least a few days. It just doesn't make any sense why they timegated everything so much. The scale and egg hunts were already long and expansive enough to pad out time without timegating it. And even then, just requiring a single daily reset or at most two would've been plenty. Look at the Elegy/Requiem armor, the griffon collections, or most of Sun's Refuge, or even just doing enough events to unlock the Dragonfall lane vendors, Anet clearly knows how to get players to spend more time and more days without making them feel frustrated or behind if they miss a day and without timegating the hell out of it. And look at the Druid/Wayfarer Stone backpack, Mawdrey/ascended items, Astralarium Weapons, LS ascended trinkets, and the like. Anet also knows how to make timegated content that isn't actively frustrating or tiring, so it's even more confusing. Druid Stone you just spend some time doing the hearts and then buy the stones, the rest isn't timegated, iirc. Mawdrey just has timegated ingredients, and the eventual output is usually able to be bought/sold on the TP. Astro weapons you did one thing per day. Finally, LS ascended trinkets just required gathering materials and magic. They were all short bursts of daily activity to get you logged in and then off you go to do whatever else you want. This seems like you log in, then spend most of your time doing tedious tasks, at least for the first 2-3 days.
---
I dunno, that probably doesn't answer your comment at all. I'm just really confused at why Anet's doing this and trying to get down my own thoughts and the details of the situation together.
---
I am not saying it's not possible or it's not easy, I am saying it's not worth it, assassins means your power will drop, your damage will drop, your heal from sun and moon will also overall drop because you're doing less damage, your damage will already be too low after dropping axe, you don't want to drop more power.
---
Feels like a Life of Brian situation.
---
I hadn't even considered climbing through the inside. Every time I've needed to get up there I've just used a combination of griffon and oakheart's essence to climb the outside.
---
daily, fotm, dungeons and raids are by nature repetitive content. So the lockout system is there to prevent constant farming (as you can repeat it indefinitely). It's a timegate for the NEXT occurence of the acitivity you just did.
---
Unlocking the skyscale isn't something you'll do every week, they didn't timegate it to prevent people from getting 10 skyscales per day. They timegated it for the sake of making people wait.
---
TLDR: Skyscale timegate isn't preventing you from doing it AGAIN, it's preventing you from doing it AT ALL.
---
Anet really hit the nail on the head with this patch.
---
/the nail is fucking dead now/
---
It's good for pacing.
---
I think they did it right this time, unlike the henge in Season 3 episode 5, that was just annoying and hollow gating.
---
This is so spot on ahaha
---
endgame btw
---
I am partial to Necro reaper spec. I use dagger/warhorn with beserker stats for the power. Most fights are easily soloable. It has great AoE, almost always has 15 might, and good CC as well.
---
Okay? You play an mmo once a week.. What do you expect?
---
Try WvW, they drop from reward tracks.
---
She is due to IRL related things, see: https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bozzmr/wheres_dulfy/enn5l52/?context=10000
---
Everyone wants skyscale asap, everyone will keep using gryphon after.
---
Oh right, wack. I hope they’re adding something like Aurora tho, I liked the journey for it back in LS3. Kind of tied together and “completed” the whole season for me. (Except the farm for the 250 blood rubies... lol)
---
Why Bloodstone Fen though? I feel out of the loop...
---
The fear of missing out was the exact reason I was done with WoW and became a gw2 player. This shit is not ok, and I don't know if I want to get Skyscale anymore.
---
I like that I have a daily checklist I can finish to 100% and than go on to other stuff. I dont mind the timegate at all.
---
either remove or edit with new info, IT is not bugged ( i just did it like 2 mins ago)
---
I agree with you, and that's not the point I wanted to make. I don't think it's a good idea for it to be able to fly without limit. At all. The point I was making is that the collections and timegating presents this mount as a way better reward than it actually is.
---
You either make the acquisition method easier and keep the mount as it is, or you make the mount a better reward for the monumental amount of effort it takes to attain it.
---
You keep the collection involved and timegated to hell and back for such a lackluster addition to the mount roster, and you've doubled down on bad ideas. I have a lot of faith it'll be adjusted in some way by Anet in the near future, I'm just not sure how they're going to go about doing it.
---
While this was hilarious, my favorite part of this episode is when you talk to Logan in camp, asking about Rytlock's behavior, and he just insists in all caps, "EVERYTHING. IS. FINE."
---
To be fair there's very little of All or Nothing to cover. Those two guides covered all the achievements, and nothing else is really so complicated as to warrant a guide.
---
Do you mean in solo, open world and/or unorganized PvE?  Or in organized group PvE?
---
Timegate is good for me, i can do 1 part of collection after work and be at same stage as guys who play 24/7.
---
KFT was flimsy anyway..., getting hijacked by lots of promo mails, that ended up in my SPAM folder almost immediately xD
---
Here we go: timegated content imo is a lazy design choice aimed at preventing players from completing a certain objective on their own terms. This meaning that if a player wants to invest a huge chunk of their time in a single sitting, why not let said player do that. By creating timegated content anet is putting an upper limit on how much progression towards a certain objective you can do at once. This not only infuriates people like me who want do fast progression on launch day, but also hinders people who might not have much free time to play the game (e.g. A few hours a week during a day or two), because it creates an artificial barrier between you and the content. All in all, what i have been saying since the druid stone collection,  let people grind and put insane hours into the game if they so choose to. And the point about player retention on a certain map could be considered moot, since unless the collection requires you to participate in X events, the people who are after the collection alone wont bother with the map stuff.
---
I do think it is designed to give multiple options to scale the wing. There is a griffon/skyescale escalator outside, there are platforms inside that allow climbing with bunny or griffon if one prefers.
---
The xp bar ist most likely an oversight and I assume it will be fixed in some manner, but out of curiosity: why care so much about xp when you obviously have your masteries maxed?
---
People forget that Kormir was trahearne before there ever was trehearne aka take the players spotlight right before the end.
---
Not entirely sure, but it should for the sake of something like heart quests or events.
---
I love those who feel obliged to rush and those who need to show off what they have before others can get it. I can sell them all my hoarded mats at premium prices. It’s win-win. ;)
---
You sure ? I though it was a Leviathan tail o_O
---
I've argued about this with my guild mates (yeah, those few, who are stll around) who defend the game no matter what comes very often, but they don't understand that I have been burned out long ago... At first new areas that came with every episode were nice, one had some not so hard meta achievements to complete, one could even complete the map with multiple chars, all was fine. But then it all got way too repetitve and more and more achievements that came with every episode took more time and in every new area one had to grind for one new material. This and the problem I still have with raids (not enough people in my guild, not willing to do it with randoms for obvious reasons) make me feel like an outsider in a franchise I love(d) for over a decade...
---
&gt;  the "Grow Lamp" Recipe is locked behind LS2, so that is another Paywall (for those that didn't obtained LS2 back in the days)) 
---
s2 maps are part of core tyria   
---
u can get the recipe from dry top but u need 10 charged crystals to craft it
---
Why waste that much time when both are already balanced enough and have their spot? Don't you see that if you add too much of something to one class/profession it hurts more than helps? Right now you have so much space and compositions to play with, plenty of good to really good support options. If you give one everything, BOOM, all the rest are obsolete.
---
Do you buy every skin that’s released for every mount? If you do perhaps you should ask yourself why?
---
It’s your choice what you want to do anyway.
---
Here some positive points about the timegate: 
---
- It makes from a story point of view perfectly sense that growing up a dragon takes some time
---
- People who actually do the collection themselves and don't follow a guide, get a headstart over people that just afk follow a guide to finish the collection
---
- The collection tells you ahead it is timegated and what LS seasons you need for the maps it will take you too.
---
- As you said it has a minor impact, so it's not a real issue that it blockes progress by not having the skyscale. 
---
P.S: Aurora was a similar collections as far as I can recall at the seasonfinal. If you look at the new legendary greatsword one could argue that this timegate is way bigger (goldtimegate) for way lower benefits ( a skin for most that already have a legendary greatsword).
---
except it doesn't accomplish that, ppl that wanna rush will do so anyway they'll just have to wait and ppl like me who do want to tke their time  will rush it because the time gate becomes a time limit.
---
God(dess) of Truth with a dash of Secrets? That really is you to a T, isn't it.
---
Same happened to me.. I joined the second I heard from the promo. Then after like a month they say it's just for America... and the app just kept crashing...
---
i highly doubt that
---
Yeah! Just give me the 25 collections where I have to waypoint and press F on things for 6 hours straight. I want to be mentally dead when I get the mount and then only ever run around on the raptor anyway!
---
The mount can't GAIN altitude, but it maintains it. So you can fly from one point of the map to the other without ever having to land.
---
What?
---
How is herald balanced? It serves no purpose in pve.
---
Renegade is better in every role. Dps, hybrid support, healing. Those three things are everything revenant excels at in pve. So how would taking hybrid support away from renegade and putting in on herald instead make everything obsolete?
---
I am with you on your point about the paywall of LS2. I haven't thought about that problem. Though you are able to buy the Grow Lamp straight up from the TP iirc. And not making the timegate more obvious is also a valid point
---
About your first point though. Players that don't have much time will always be left out on some content. Just take a look at legendaries. They take ages to complete. Even for me as someone who has multiple hours a day to play the game. And given that the Skyscale really isn't a huge and incredible new addition to the game I really don't see the problem.
---
That is a popular fan theory, it has however not been confirmed inside or outside the game.
---
Are we taking META level here?
---
I don't mind and actually support time gated stuff.. however it can easily be too long. Which I think the mount is. I say at least reduce it by 25%
---
Well done detective.
---
Well that's an explosion of nostalgia.
---
Thanks for this. Loved PSO.
---
Need 10 of em? Or more? I got a ton
---
I just used 20 charged quartz for ascended crafting, jfc
---
He probably does. I have 562 of 'em. I try to make one a day for a very long time now.
---
I love the game and the developers for making it, but my admiration only goes so far, and its a shame that a great episode was soured with the release method of the mount. I think the best case is that they have something else tied to them that they are keeping secret. My personal guess is that they are beta testing the skyscales and timegating them gives time to test and fix in an isolated setting. Worst case is that they are testing a new way of releasing content. Which I mean, just stagger releases and just release the mount next week without timegated collections, don't do this artificial delay crap. Destiny 2 had started doing something similar to living world the past 6 months and they've nailed staggered releases so far, but what Anet did with the mounts isn't it.
---
I think they were just put on a bus for now to avoid the "other elder dragons doing nothing while we deal with one of them" problem. Jormag in particular does have mortal minions in the Sons of Svanir who might try to wake him up again.

---
Wow...I understand that it's fun to work for something to obtain it - I liked the Idea of completing Events to progress the collection.
---
But timegating is just sad - it has no fun at all. Whats the Game-Design Reason that this is good? On the Release of POF I saw people already flying with the Griffon and that was fine - i know people who still work on the griffon in their own pace.  
---
Just because the LW-Episodes take roughly 2hrs to complete, you do not need to strech them with such silly time-gating methods :(
---
Holy moly these replies are vicious. 
---
Anet had a problem that players would play the game for 3 hours when the patch drops and then complain about no content for two months.
---
The skyscale is no small item. It took alot of time to make and getting is should be an achievement. If you want to not play the game so badly why are you still here anyway?
---
Aw hell yeh
---
I really don't like the first phase where there are so many people farming it that you can't really see anything and the bosses basically melt away before your eyes. Be a few steps behind and you've already missed out. Be right at the front and you still have to do next to nothing except to run along with the zerg. 
---
But otherwise, it is a nice meta, I like the part with the ships.
---
It is time to make a Avatar meme!

---
Jeez people should stop whining. Y'all just lazy and expect to get the new shit without any effort at all.
---
...how much depth do they think there is to a mount?
---
You forget some stuff.
---
Rene is good dps, as condi, which isn't best in a lot of bosses. As power, the damage it provides is way less than the damage a power boon it herald provides.
---
As healer, the herald is able to provide boons to 10 ppl and alacrity, altho I'm not 100% what uptime this would result on. As healer, a renegade provides might to its sub, alacrity, and offensive buff in form of kalla elite.
---
Again, imo at least, this is preatty balanced.
---
true, then it would be time gated AND locked behind rng or exclusive to the raid community
---
I'm mostly with you, but I did immensely enjoy taking the final fight into Kralkatorrik, and honestly, I think that was enough to salvage the episode for me. It's a little bit odd I feel that way now, because the first five minutes were so disappointing to me I grumbled about it the whole playthrough.
---
Oh no a few days extra. It's the end of the world. /s
---
Except with the gating it makes me not want to play any PoF content at all as the exp gained is useless.
---
Ok, sorry got that one wrong. Edited my comment.
---
Are are seriouse mate ?
---
Alright thats good. Thanks again :)
---
You should see mine then... It tells you to hold... And I barely moved a fucking inch
---
just adding: you can get quartz crystals from DT and peoples homeini

ArenaNet controls the demand. They Sigil of Nullification'd something worse - a daily time gated material.

Do you need one or more than one Grow Lamp?
---
I have spent quite a lot of money on gems for skins, outfits, and such.  I liked them and felt I could support the game a bit.  The problem is that the only thing companies like anet seem to care one iota for is the bottom line.  Look at how little anet ever responds to anything on here or the forum.  Do you think they care they've upset a large portion of the player base?
---
The point is that it doesn't have to be this way. The collection can be long by itself as much as devs want, but putting artificial time gates hurt casual players like OP more.
---
And it is a poor financial decision too. I would say people like OP would be more inclined to buy gems due to their limited time to get gold, and by delaying them of the mount artificially there is a chance that these players will not buy a Skyscale skin as they are still doing collection.
---
The people behind Inception would be proud
---
Yes. They're useful for DPS on Weaver (PoF spec) and Tempest (HoT spec) though Weaver is the more "meta" class. I believe for Weaver it's sword/dagger or staff weapons. Elementalist also has the ability to run as a healer, and while it's useful in specific groups and settings, it isn't meta. Just stating that it exists. Lastly, open world is decent, especially if you get more casual stats such as celestial which would allow you to do damage, heal yourself, and take hits. This wouldn't pass for an end game group DPS slot, but works well for open world and questing. Overall, elementalist has a lot of flexibility and is one of the high dps choices for end game content.
---
Yeh completed personal story and have all expacs - ill take a look at silverwastes tonight
---
Please, I'm a Warframe player, I have timewalls in my bloodstream.
---
GW2 already has timewalls that people aren't complaining as much about. Most notably the timegated resources that allow you to speed up the process by buying them from other players.
---
Also length of a timewall is kind of a hard thing to figure out, cause if you make it too long it just makes people feel like they're not doing enough progress and just decide to drop it entirely.
---
I think we started the episode and then I did see that there was a locked mastery but you cant even click on it to see it.
---
Okay I have to ask this, I know the reference (just by hanging in this sub) but I haven't played Nightfall so... does she actually say that?
---
Or could have the treatment of raid skins, make a currency just from the meta that lets you buy them. Make it expensive enough if ascended or an option to just buy the skin.
---

---
We knew there would be a gold sink. 
---
The whole collection layers + timegate is still bullshit. It should have been unlocked as part of story and the collection should have been optional for some kind of bonus.
---
We don't know. The commander called her an Elder Dragon. Kralk called her the first of her new kind.

We can only assume. He don't have 100% information.

so u better buy the lamp and the food from the tp instead of praying to rng gods
---
It's from when Snaff goes into Kralkatorrik's mind and describes it as a hurricane that seeks to consume and destroy everything and is maddeningly hating anything that isn't itself. In the final instance, Kralkatorrik says his torment promised that the pain would end if he consumed everything, and he succumbed to its claims.
---
god: so i just decided beetroot juice makes you immune to all diseases so long as you drink it daily

beetroot: lol i cost $5,000,000/kg now
---
you: to be fair, god doesn't control the market direc[*is accidentally killed by a stampede of heretical rutabaga farmers*]
---
I'd like to present my own counter argument:
---
They might be expensive right now, but you can actually buy the Grow Lamp and Skyscale Food to bypass some of the time gates.
---
Thus, part of your (actually pretty rude) argument ultimately doesn't make sense.
---
I really miss long term content or a sense of progression in Guild Wars 2. Sure, I loved WoW for reputations and progress raiding and delved into that to the extent that I completed the original version of Insane in the Membrane and joined server first-competing raid guilds. So maybe I'm a touch on the more extreme side but Guild Wars 2 has absolutely *no* engaging sense of progression or long term achievement. Raids are trivial and can't be progressed in a traditional way, CMs are trivial, we have no gear progression, masteries have been nerfed and introduced too slowly and elite specs require very little effort to unlock. Even new characters are tomed, geared from the bank and given their elite spec within a couple of hours. 
---
I actually like that there is something, that is optional, to work towards over a longer period of time than the half hour it normally takes for new masteries. I'm in no rush to get the mount but I'll savour the moments where it feels like I'm making gradual progress - like with the druid stone only it won't be another ascended item to sit in my bank.
---
What are you playing cause that's not this game.
---
I think the Friends in High Places achievement is bugged at the moment, at least it was for me. It says you must speak to Taimi OR Sayida on the airship, but I didn't get the achievement for speaking to Taimi. I had to speak to Sayida to get it. Obviously not an obsctructive bug but... yknow.
---
Being one whose not looking forward to the potential visual noise AFK skyscale riders will add to the community at player hubs, I'm somewhat ambivalent about the timegates. I don't like them, but the notion that many are giving up on getting it doesn't bother me either. 
---
That said, I'm all for Arena Net adjusting it to be less tedious. Having to revisit Charged Quartz Crystals is the main thing I would like to see gutted out the most.
---
Here are some other passing thoughts:
---
* People don't swap to Jackal for speed boosts. Raptor's leap is faster, this was observed quite extensively at the race during Queen's Gauntlet. Jackal's advantage is being able to dodge more, make sharp turns, and negate falling damage on demand without dismounting (if you lack a griffon)
---
* Skyscale will definitely be the most niche but I think it'll still be relatively enjoyed for its precision flying. Springer and Griffon are both fantastic but they can be unwieldy. Skyscale boasts the most smooth ascending and descending movements.
---
* I do agree Arena Net screwed up by hyping it too much. All that hype, intentional or not, lulled many into thinking it would be like the Roller Beetle, acquirable within a day and something we should look forward to enjoying the masteries of right away.

Regularly playing the game is also to put down effort. A player who plays the game a lot every day won't have any problems unless they are impatient. Every person in the game getting the new stuff easily the first day would be lame as hell. Give it to those who actually stick around and force people to play. It's marketing 101.
---
POE has much less to know. Literally the only thing to know is builds. MMOs are much much bigger.
---
**yes**, on every class not just dh
---
I'm fine with the collections. I just don't understand why I'm forced to do it spread out over 1,5 week.
---
People talk like anet closed down any other content when the episode arrived. Personally, I'll do what I usually do in gw2 when I have done the daily part of the collection. I don't see the harm.
---
I wasn't talking about this game.
---
Imagine those who can only play 1hour/month. It will take years huh?
---
MMORPG requires a lot of time. I personally wouldn't play GW2 if I only had a saturday for it. It's like torturing yourself.
---
It's 2019, you can't pretend that 20 years of mmo have not passed.
---
Queensdale just outside the fort near DR is the one I use.
---
All this Skyscale malarkey is very reminiscent of the Wayfarer Henge acquisition. I'm thinking acquiring the Skyscale will be part of a trinket thing. My hopes and dreams are rekindled.
---

No you still get spirit shards. The exp goes towards a hidden exp bar

Any arguments for that ? Other than the current worldwide trend of calling "badly written" everything that doesn't unfold exactly like one thought it would ...
---
Woah, i have like 200 charged crystals... is the lamp still cheap to make?
---
As far as I could tell I still got spirits shards. so it's just not showing it's actually a non issue and will be fixed otherwise:)

Ok but Aurora let you work on it before it came out by having things already done for it. This is just timegateception and it doesn't feel good.
---
I'll comment to this post only after 100 upvotes.
---
NOTE: You're allowed only **1 upvote** per month
---
Calling it now, 4th collection is called "Troublesome Skycales" because you gotta wait till the skyscale finished puberty to be willing to learn whatever you plan to teach her.
---
You should be bothered. You shouldn't just let game companies decide for you how you structure your play time. Only you should have that choice.
---
Wait, seriously, 24 days?? I've just finished collecting the scales! At the rate I have time to play right now, that will take me MONTHS!!!
---
&gt;I'm not saying they remove all the time-gates
---
no thanks. remove all the time-gates!
---
I just got a spirit shard so my guess is you get the spirit shard as soon as you complete the track just check it out.
---
But sitting around for 24 hours poking their noses is exactly what they're doing with the skyscale
---
as gwen said gods don't deserve our pity.
---
Since when has Deadye been king of DPS? It hasn't been that for a while now, at least four months.
---
DD is just better than DE in a lot of situations now, and no, it has not gotten nerfs. Havoc Specialist is a buff. It is one of your best all-around dps classes for most bosses. 
---
It is one of the best, if not meta, choices for Sabetha, Slothasor, and Conjured Amalgamate, and it is a meta choice for Samarog and *especially* Qadim. It will work well on most other bosses.
---
 There are two bosses you should never bring it to under any circumstances and if you do people will rightfully question your judgement, and those are Matthias and Cairn because your staff auto has a reflect on it. Bringing power daredevil there just screams "I know absolutely nothing about this boss". (You also shouldn't bring it to SH or Largos but at least there your auto won't contribute to killing everyone).
---
These are probably the same people who say it takes skill to get "best gear" rather than.. time and/or money.
---
This is the thing. The few days it takes to collect the mount will be long forgotten in a month or so, but the same people will then be complaining that they have nothing to do in-game anymore.
---
I feel sorry for Anet sometimes, having to cater to folks with zero patience who both instant and constant gratification.
---
are you sure we knew it was a gold sink, or even a time sink? Many people (including me) thought the unlock would be something similar to the rollerbeetle. The beetle didn't have a gold cost (if i don't remember bad) nor such a big timegate.
---
I believe anet realized that mounts are the big selling point so decided to make them the real magnet of the release to keep people busy.
---
On previous LS releases i just did the story, completed the meta achievement and then just purchase the home instance node to include in my daily gathering routine. This ussually took me 2-3 days and after that i would just return to my usual routine. This time the time gate is going to make me spend more time. I still remember that annoying backpack on the last LS season that took, what? 16 days to complete?
---
Well then buy the pot and food off the tp.
---
There is still no content left after you complete the collection for the day and wait for the daily reset, lul.
---
I dunno I kinda like the time gate... It gives us a lot to work for until LWS5, especially if you guys wanna get the Mist Shard armor like I do.
---
True I suppose, but Herald is literally even more auto-ing than power thief builds are. Herald builds just turn on a drain skill and then press 4 and 2 off cooldown while autoing.
---
You could always join the raid community.
---
guess ive been out of the raid scene for too long, last time I tried using DD I was kicked from the party for my class
---
Well, I am also wonna participate in beggaring for keys.) Ready for downvotes ;\_;
---
Yup, by the time they unlocked Skyscale they no longer new.
---
Good.
---
Try it in dry top, just go 2 metres away from waypoint into quickand and you don't even need to jump and can do it way faster. :)
---
Or.....or....
---
Just play the game and ress people on world bosses, metas, and so.... there is always huge amount of them. For example Tarir's traitor ;-)
---
If you were kicked any time after July of last year, they were dumb. Daredevil has been a very good pick since then.
---
frost frontier
---
I'm nowhere near this point, but this is just silly.  New content does not consist of doing the exact same thing multiple days in a row for a collection.
---
Hello,
---
the game crashs every time when I go from fullscreen into window mode since LS update  
---
It's just me or a general bug?
---
Pretty sure normal drops is what you're getting. Or maybe you mean in Central Tyria or HOT. Those are separate areas for spirit shard levelling. "Once in  a while" wouldn't be what we're looking for. Rather , a large number all at once , as accumulated xp is paid out.
---
how many grow lamps do you need total?
---
It honestly does need fixing. I don't care at ALL to put a bunch of work into it but if I wanna keep going after one collection I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO KEEP GOING.
---
Seriously, at this point they just need to let it unlock like the rest of the normal mounts from the story, or even at just the end of the scales and medicine part, and put something else as a related bonus at the end of the now _optional_ collection. 
---
This thing is a PR nightmare they didn't need after the layoffs.
---
Wow, another Ragnarok player :D It was my first proper MMO, loved it, but couldn't go back any more.
---
Exactly this.  I'm one scale into the first collection.  Lord knows when I'll finish it while still being able to do the stuff I actually consider fun in game.  Oh wait, I probably can't.  Have fun or grind out the mount slowly over the next few weeks...
---
But that implies I get the Skyscale to unlock all the backlog of EXP?
---
DD is pretty much the go to Thief class. Rifle DE will do more damage.... Kinda... It has to be very specific fights where you don't need to move much, or at all. If it's a fight where you need to move, then it will quickly fall behind DD.
---
Right now DD can bench about 35k on the golem. It's not quite the best damage, but it's fairly reliable. Thief is a pretty close to top damage dealer on almost every fight, where a lot of the classes that beat it, generally can only do it on specific fights.
---
DD is also a safe class to just have. With auto attacks alone, with proper gear and food, you can break 20k DPS. Since most pugs struggle to hit 15k, this means even a bad thief will be doing good enough damage.
---
There was probably a bigger reason you got kicked. Either they needed a support class, which Thief isn't (excluding heal and boon, but that's not exactly common strats in pugs, and is also only for two fights), or it was one of the fights that strongly favor condi classes (or VG, and they where full up on power, and needed condi for red). That or you where underperforming. If they just straight kicked you because they where under the impression that DD is bad, then they are just hard stupid and probably don't clear bosses often.
---
I mean sure. But really , the skyscale seems pretty underwhelming for the effort. Is it fine ? Yeah. I didn't expect a super-Dragon Griffon replacement. But effort/irritation vs. quality , I'm not sure it's a great deal. Plus making the mastery locked but not hidden is super shitty , it blocks you from getting spirit shards until you do it , whether you want it or not.
---
Yeah, it seems like we talk a lot about “dragon corruption” but it seems that may have literally been dragons being corrupted and using them as a way to spread corruption, not corruption directly from the dragons. Which is interesting, and kinda sheds a light on why dragon minions are all mostly mind controlled essentially. 
---
Or maybe it was just Kralk whose weakness was his heart, because his offspring did like, actually care about life as well. 
---
Who knows.
---
&gt; design flaw
---
This is exactly the definition of the current situation ....
---
Titans are cosmic beings and some planet's are Titans "eggs". The pantheon is on a trip around  the cosmos to find those eggs and make preparations so it can hatch in peace. Azeroth hasn't hatched yet but is conscious apparently? And the big bad titan tried to kill her by ramming a swird in the planet but ultimately failed.
---
I think im just gonna find a raid guild and just not do PUG's anymore
---
I’ve said this several times already so:
---
Herald isn’t useless in PVP and is a beast in wvw. It’s a *mobile boon bot* so it provides *essential boons* on the move.
---
The only boon Renegade can provide reliably is Alacrity, and might to a lesser extent to only 5 people. Renegade’s Regen application was greatly nerfed when they changed ventari recently too. 
---
Second, herald has greater reach than renegade so it can support allies who are spread apart. Renegade has powerful support if your allies aren’t running like headless chickens which tends to happen in fractals. 
---
There is significance in the nuance of *how* support is provided, not just the boons itself.
---
If this is true, I'm going to have thousands of the damn things when I finally get around to finishing all the masteries.
---
Trying to figure out which mounts i need in order to do the collection for the skyscale mount? please. i only have the raptor atm
---
I started with sylvari too, and that first map absolutely charmed me to the game. And the first time I saw the world boss (Jungle Wurm) was soo epic :D
---
In which world can getting 10 keys per hour be considered not exploitative, exactly ?
---
There was an issue with another bugged event yesterday that seemed to stall other events in the area. If there's a Priory scholar (with a "defend" icon) standing around doing nothing, the other event isn't going to start anytime soon and you need to find a new map instance. There was even a post here about the bug when it first happened: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bp1rmu/bug_saving_skyscales_skycale_of_fear_glossophobia/
---
Shortest map to complete. Fewer PoI/vistas, and verticality profits to griffon very much.
---
&gt; The community in this game is amazing (at least in NA)
---
on EU too, I can confirm :)
---
Same issue for me, been waiting patiently for a fix.
---
Yep, about 10g worth of materials + 10 charged quartz that you can sell for 60+g right now. :D
---
Im glad i daily craft charged quartz.  Have like 300 in the bank.
---
This is a nightmare for weekend only players or those who cannot play 2-3 hours a day.
---
Inpatient is right. 
---
You'll go crazy with the timegating. &lt;3
---
Bloodstone Fen has no hearts and has a total of about 15 POI/waypoint/etc.  You can do the map completion on a level 2 character in literally 5 minutes.
---
Yummy
---
At least grow lamps have a reliable way of acquisition albeit timegated. Nullification was either RNG or TP
---
That was exactly what they did for Aurora with the Wayfarer's Henge collection. There is nothing new in this approach.
---
All of them, and at the same time, none of them. They help in getting you around the map for the collections but it doesn't seem that there are any that are strictly required, but it would be immensely helpful instead of having to run around picking up the rented skyscale each time.
---
Something in the water, please :D Tequatl's fight is so much more interesting (and easier!) than the Claw's.
---
They can drop
---
That's the thing , we only have one shifty , kinda-dev post on it. And I've had well informed players tell me that it works both ways. According to my testing , it's false. But , the way it's phrased, the large number of shards could have popped into my wallet at some point I wasn't watching, not at the end , when I tested ( based on his phrasing) . But I still think I would have noticed such a big bump.
---
F
---
Are you going to the correct spot? He's kinda near the entrance when you leave the like cave mouth thing, to the left. He's not deep in the Refuge.
---
i thought charging it once per day was the norm. thank god i was stupidly farming for it cause i wanted celestial gear on all my characters
---
"it's not my problem so it must be non-existent"
---
But it's consistent, it isn't timegating by pointless rng like in anthem, you can take the minimum time or more, but you'll know how long you are going to take.  
---
I'm sure people would also yell if they instead made it a paywall instead of a timegate, I'd rather take a timegate any day.
---
No skyscale = no more spirit shards from PoF and season 4 maps.
---
You can find it here - https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Server_reset#Weekly_reset 
---
It should automatically choose the right time zone for you
---
If that is how you got it then there are other wich works as well . I got mine in a little cave with sick Skyscale. Or maybe I wasnt paying attention where it was on the map.
---
In theory, yes, as there *are* Living world Season 3 mastery things like Oakheart vines and bouncing mushrooms in the Melandru area (where a lot of the collection tends to take place) that you can use in lieu of the mounts.
---
Tbh as an originally GW2 player, I mostly play GW1 for experiencing the lore and getting the HoM rewards. GW1's gameplay is a bit frustrating, as I'm used to GW2's QoL features 😅 (eg. trading post, *way* more responsive movement controls, account-bound achievements, wardrobe system) Otoh I really like that I can play GW1 as a single player game for the most part, and that it has customisable UI and click-to-move and move-to-enemy/NPC/object.
---
This implies there is gameplay content behind the skyscale to be played.  I have everything to raise the skyscale within an hour.  I cannot progress any further for the next 3 days because Anet says so.   They don't even disguise it as some sort of grind,  it's just a giant sign that says, "You may only progress this far today!"
---
&gt; did you know you can get the new legendary on day 1,
---
Collectionless legendaries were always a terrible decision; in case of the 1st gen ones - an entirely credit-card driven design decision. The fact that the playerbase got used to it is not an excuse.
---
Animations, sounds, mechanics, the way it moves into space...there's a bit of stuff
---
Having it be locked but hidden , which prevents xp , was a shitty move.
---
I have a consortium sickle with glyph of bounty and then volatile mining and lumber. I hope to one day get the unbound ones because they harvest the whole node in one click even if it would normally take multiple.
---
Not to mention this patch's armor set doesn't even have a collection to go with it :)
---
Returning player here!
---
I haven't played since ~Season 2 and am starting over with a new character just to get a fresh start.
---
I have two level 80 boosts sitting around and had the thought of whether it'd be worth it or not to level a character and do map completion or use a level 80 character to do map completion.
---
For materials/equipment/items/mastery, is it better (in the long run) to do map completion on a leveling character or a boosted level 80 character?
---
couldn't a rich quartz node also randomly give you charged quartz as well?
---
&gt;  breaking ground on GW3.
---
They put out news a while ago that they're doubling down on GW2 because its too expensive to create a new MMO in this economy.
---
Lmaooo feisty, I like it
---
I actually welcome the pace slowing. I get that it’s artificial, but the fact that things are so rarely time gated makes it seem like a bigger accomplishment. 
---
Before I get “corrected,” yes things are rarely time gated. I know you can come up with like 5 examples.  But that’s still rare.
---
hehe they said erect like peepee
---
The best gold farm now is the new map. Farm there ;)
---
Everything Josh Foreman said on his stream about it lines up with what she said.
---
I play action camera on my Weaver!
---
I actually love it. Worth giving a try and seeing if it's for you
---
you do know that people have been doing collections to get to the point they get time-gated? honestly it sounds like YOU'RE the one who hasnt done any of the grind to try for this mount...
---
1k gold? Thats a joke right?
---
Can we *not* dilute words like "anti-consumer"?
---
i am a raider, i have 2 sets of legendary pve armor. but i would understand why players would be upset if the skyscale was a raid exclusive
---
Fair
---
One of the bosses in Dragonfall also has an "undead hoard". Not horde.
---
Warclaw was too easy and fast to get, so they had to balance that.
---
Now we'll never know how that bet he made went.
---
its the comparison that this sub deserves, but not the one it needs right now, so you’ll downvote me, cause i can take it. im not a hero, im a silent guardian, a protector. a Dark Ass.
---
At least if you do it in your home instance you can cry openly and not draw attention to yourself.
---
They made Wayfarer's Henge faster?
---
Wait until he learns that Griffon can climb and gain altitude too. Kid is going to have his whole argument blown out of the water. Yet alone all of the videos showcasing how precise and smooth a griffons flight can be in tight areas so long as you actually take the ten minutes needed to learn its flight controls
---
How to make your player engagement metrics look great while simultaneously pissing off all yor players.
---
Intriguing. I know a lot of veterans haven't had a use for this stuff in forever
---
lel, well, its not too bad in my opinion. You can have less time gates by paying a bit, and the collections are actually fun.
---
&gt; And RP should never come at the expense of actually being fun.
---
Fun is subjective. Looking at the situation, I personally don't see the obviously world-shattering, baby-murdering problem that everyone's throwing a pitched hissy-fit about. Then again, I was raised on a steady diet of grindy Korean F2Ps so maybe I'm just used to things being slow and having lots of slow requirements.
---
Because people can enjoy bad content for a multitude of reasons.   Here's a few short things I would enjoy, that would be considered bad content and upset half of the playerbase.
---
* Time gate the story
---
* Make the Kralk fight a raid only boss.
---
* After 3 months, delete the map and make it a fractal
---
* Increase the xp required for skyscale mastery to 10mil.  (500k is so small)
---
Extreme examples,  but nobody should complain because I would enjoy that, right?
---
Warframe forum told me they're the friendliest community so you're obviously wrong
---
Don't they only count like 1-2 kills from a pack of pocket raptors?
---
&gt;  Am I screwed?
---
Yes very.
---
Unless you want to pay 140g for a grow lamp and hatchling food, which I recommend you do sooner rather than later, because tommorow the price is gonna skyrocket.
---
Thursday 16:00 UTC-4 — Map bonus rewards reset. , i don't know what time that is to est time lol
---
They're going to a hidden counter, you don't lose them. There was a developer comment on that recently.
---
This could be explained by history recordings being iffy.
---
And you know... Dragons still had to do their job and consume magic evil or not.
---
&gt;  It feels like they just want me to log in every day to do something asinine and I get a mount at the end of it for doing mundane errands.
---
Were you currently doing something else in the game? Because I'm willing to bet that a fair portion of the people losing their minds in this thread were already doing the "mundane daily errand" grind that already existed.
---
I only have 1 mount maxed. I'm working on my griphon. I've only just realized from this thread that I'm no longer earning XP towards that. This really sucks for me as a returning player as I have zero crystals and probably won't manage to get one per day for 22 days straight.   
---
So now my mastery is dead in the water. Can I abandon this quest??
---
Kralk's primary aspect was probably Crystal, and his secondary aspect, in my opinion, would be either Time or as you say, Light.
---
But not as fun as this with strangers all laughing together! :D
---
You need 22. 12 for food, 10 for the lamp.
---
Imagine:
---
You want to play piano, but you know that learning and "mastering" an instrument requires thousands hours of practice. You can play and practice for short amounts of time only few times a week.
---
*What now? The problem is not the piano. Some things requires time to put in.*
---
I literally outlined why Ren will have difficulties upkeeping might solo but you do you I guess
---
You shouldn't need to complete the meta to do map complete.  You can hop over the walls and kill the mobs inside.  Might be a bit difficult though.
---
Either way, in the future they're going to rework some PoF metas so there should be new life in that meta by then.
---
After completing 13/14 of the Saving Skyscales Achi, the last item tells me to see Gorrik in Suns Refuge but I cant find him and there is no collection marker visible either, any tips?
---
That needs to be done game-wide tbh. This business of "you need to train all the masteries or else you never get spirit shards in that region again" needs to ***FUCKING DIE.***
---
I dont know how you would connect Time to him
---
Which they kind of are 😅 I wish their differences from human were more emphasised in the game. (Shapeshifting, idk if there's anything else aside of their general viking/northern aesthetic.)
---
We don't know yet... Not all the collections have been revealed, so we can't make a complete total of the gold involved.
---
I'd unlock all of them first, then you need to complete the riverlands [Augury rock ascension event](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Path_to_Ascension) (or the [map meta version](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shift_beyond_reality_to_confront_the_crazed_doppelganger)) to kill a doppelganger, need to do the [teaching event in Vabbi](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Speak_from_the_lectern_to_lecture_against_Joko%27s_brainwashing_before_the_instructor_arrives), frozen by the claw of Jormag (or bitterfrost if you have it), need to do the [rune locked doors mini dungeon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rune-Locked_Doors) or get someone to portal you through, and maybe the one on a wall in Blazeridge Steppes (needs a springer and a bunch of jumps might want to get portaled up). Really though there are only 2 events and the only important one would be the doppelganger but I'm sure even weeks from now you could find a group doing it or run it with only a few people.

---
Amen. I've put this collection on hold until there's a comprehensive guide and until the stuff I'll need to buy from TP will cost less.
---
I don't know what the point is. Am I required to throw a hissy-fit about things unless I understand them and can explain them at length?
---
I said the situation looks fine to me. It does. What else is actually being expected of me here?
---
If you don't have your masteries maxed out you are still earning xp. The loss only occurs if all unlocked trait lines are maxed, so you wouldn't be maxing trait lines anyways but getting the - largely worthless - spirit shards.
---
So... I shouldn't mention I made the guild Church of Aurene back when A Crack in the Ice came out? Would you like a pamphlet?
---
They mean there isn't an achievement for collecting the entire set
---
I guess I could have been more clear in the OP.  The upgraded set does not have anything associated with it.
---

---
with enough backlash maybe Anet will fix the timegate (they want us to enjoy the game after all)
---
So you only bought the skins you liked. Thanks for answering my question.
---
To answer yours, yes I think they do care that they’ve upset so many people. Unfortunately that doesn’t mean they will change it to a more acceptable grind.
---
For those who are out of the loop: Meme from GW1  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxmkAoLC6\_4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxmkAoLC6_4)
---
As normal drops I meant that on kill of *any* monster, you can gain whole spirit shard as a loot, not as a gain from XP.
---
There are players in WvW who are forced to transfer every 8 weeks because their guild is on a host server that is locked and they have ot move to the link of that host every time. They would love to have free movments but they are not. The game is buy to play and transfers are one of those things that costs. It sucks but it does. 
---
How ever you can easy farm those gold and exchange to gems and get the transfer so i don't really see that it is that big of a deal for you who just need to transfer one time.
---
Piano doesn't stop making sound after you play it an hour per day.
---
Remember when people farmed bl keys by completing to story level 10 repeatedly? Imagine if they just suddenly labeled it an exploit if instead of being able to get 5 keys an hour you could get slightly more.
---
If that was the case then it would say that, no? And in my wardrobe i would now have two Ironfist skins, no? And yet there is not.
---
Whats so special about bloodstone fen? Cant you do that on any map?
---
Nah, this is pretty tame for GW2.
---
We got them to adjust the price on Heart of Thorns pre-launch if I recall. And don't even get any of us started on the hollering we did about WvW or any IRL drama.

&gt;Overall, I think Arenanet and their livestreams hyped up Skyscale to be \*\*\*more\*\*\* than it really is.
---
I was honestly expecting the SkyScale to be the people's Griffon, as in an option you gain easily by participating in the 06 content, but didn't want (or couldn't afford) to do the Griffon Gold sink. I was expecting a more lengthy story that basically required flying in the mists, so take this mount, hero, and take to the skies, much like the raptor. Boy was I wrong.
---
Wait, really?
---
Welp, there goes any more transmutation charges I might have ever gotten outside of the log-in rewards.
---
It's exactly the opposite way: timegates hurt hardcore gamers a lot more than casuals. That's literally the point of timegates - that people who have 24 hours a day to play the game don't really get advantage over people who can only rack up a couple of hours per week / month. This is actually super convenient for casuals and I'm pretty sure it's mostly the hardcore players who are p\*ssed.
---
Thanks for the clarification 😀
---
They were at 90 last night, so watch market prices as you spend.
---
Thanks :) Good to know
---
Tip² : interact with it 'till the wifi symbol disappear
---
Mother truckers! If I had known this I wouldn't have map completed Dragonfall!
---
As far as you know, is there any other website doing guides?
---
you sound like the biggest whiner here
---
I have to assume you're new, cause the alternative is you live under a digital rock. This is pretty tame for the community.
---
We got them to adjust the bonuses on Heart of Thorns pre-launch if I recall correctly - And the launch price on PoF ended up being lower a few years later. And don't even get any of us started on the hollering people have done about SAB, WvW or any IRL drama.
---
Remember the Chakk experiment of Taimi where the Chakk filters the death and other types of magics.
---
Imagine thinking /u/Equal_War 's post has any sort of "feeling superior" in it, and then presuming to know their personality traits from that one single post and judging them for it.
---
Enjoy other games if they game you are currently playing isn’t fun to play.
---
Just sush and enjoy the content? When a waiter serves you bad food that’s cold I guess you just sush and enjoy the contents of that meal, huh?
---
People like you ruin things lol.
---
Yeah you're right, but the most important refill is the flight meter, no? That's why I got confused.
---
I assure you you are not in the majority. 90% of ppl are not capable of doing this
---
If you play an hour a week and get a new mount after a couple of months I'd say that's a pretty good medium term reward.
---
So do something else while you "wait."
---
I genuinely question your definition of fun.  
---
Glad you relaxed moving around the same map 3 times.   
---
Hope you enjoy this collection and you get the fun you paid for.  
---
There are plenty of things i've defended this game for and still will. This is not one of them.  
---
I'm not talking about time gating. I'm talking about **everything.**  
---
You enjoy the quality content made specifically for you. I'll completely ignore this things existence and study instead. The amount of time this game wants for a giant floating brick is absolutely stupid.  
---
You have a time gate, time sink and gold sink. You do one, not all 3.  
---
Since it's all 3. The reward isn't worth the time that could be spent elsewhere.   
---
You on the other hand seem to just be fine with this. Glad this mount is worth anything else you're doing.
---
Yeah, I'm a filthy casual. I just hit 250g for the Griffin. I don't have 500 in any craft. Only Ascended items I have are from Laurels and Knight of Thorns. I've been playing since release.
---
Collections aren't content
---
&gt;"Blablabla entitlement blablabla whine" Gah.
---
The absolutely incredible irony. Holy shit.
---
This mount is so hard and tedious  to get i believe they won't give it any skins, or might be like the wvw one where they dump a few and forget it exist
---
People asked for content which lasts longer than 1 day. now complaining. I for myself just finished the previous  story and made it to the new map.  
---
It is like wanting to own your own house but not make the collection of working hours spent at work dayli to convert them to currency which is on your bank, getting enough to be accepted by the bank for a credit and so on. hiring companies who plan, deliver material and build your house from ground on. 
---
Give me heat than I will give you some wood doesn't work. but this impatience is cancer. where is the joy?
---
I should complain or other gemer who just have a few hours a day. but I am happy to stay on a map not just for exploring it for 100% finishing story and never set a foot on again.
---
cheers.
---
I've got 1/25 and didn't even see the one event I've got lol
---
I think of Lugia when I see that
---
This morning, I did a branch of the Dragonfall meta and then a round in Istan and they're both pretty profitable. If you're not working on the new armour, the currency breaks down into a huge amount of volatile magic.
---
The wiki normally chooses the right time zone for you. UTC-4 is EDT, but if you really need EST, it would be UTC-5 (15:00).
---
Might wanna check the dictionary, I don't think that word means what you think it means.
---
Only guide that I know of is this one here on reddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bomiqm/skyscale_scales_collection_unlock_thread/
---
magic of growth just seemed like plant magic to me
---
You mean top 10 anime deaths
---
Think you are looking to deep into it. They probably just broke the primary magics down into their subsets, for instance fire can be magic of destruction, magic of rebirth, magic of power, etc. Magic of growth is probably just a sub set of magic of life (nature)
---
Wow you get sick for nothing, typical emotional snowflake of this generation.
---
Btw, kids that can play a lot everyday don't have a problem with Time gating, as you said, for them it'll only be a matter of days.
---
The problem is for those with job and family, who don't have the time flexibility to ignore the timegates.
---
Exactly this. Other chapters that did not have so much content in it, cough Kourna. there was litterally post after post after post on reddit about how there was no content and everything was done in a day, boooooooooo, ded game i will change and my guild and all my buddies and their goldfishes will quit too. 
---
So there is no way to please all. It just is a impossible mission for Arena Net to do.
---
Yeah, in his case he probably can't farm that much anyways so he shouldn't expect to be able to get everything. Just like how I only have 3 legendaries in 6 years because I don't play that often (maybe 2 times a week). I am still just starting the first and second collection for now while also working on griffon (at the 3rd collection right now).
---
It's how MMOs are. If you lack the time to play, but got the money, maybe you should get some gems to convert for gold to accelerate progress wherever you can... :S
---
I don't have the commitment or the money right now so I've been just selling the big amount of stuff I accumulated years ago to buy my way to the griffon.
---
I still remember the complains shortly after HoT came out. It took me 6 months to unlock all of the masteries and yet some players had them after a few weeks. And yet, after a while players complained about that there is "nothing left to do". Some already complain about that there is not enough stuff to do and you can do the events as many times as you like, they still will get boring after a while.
---
Those collections don't have anything to do with more or less content and I don't know why it matters because they give you a reason to come back to the map, to do something and then do something else and not do all of it and then never look back.
---
And no, "better rewards" are not the answer for this because then there always need to be better or equal rewards but this is literally impossible to balance.
---
So I don't know, I kind of like it that way because it gives me an incentive to get to the map more than the first few days.
---
achievement rewards added to the unlock table? lol
---
For Anet its damned if they do damned if they don't.
---
I just want the Ebon Vanguard armour from Eye of the North.
---
Without instance hopping you can do usually like 2-4 per map reset. So yeah it quite bad when to complete gloves collection you need 2 hour "exploit fiesta".
---
Thief is great, one of the most consistent high dpsers with a very simple rotation if you can even call it a rotation.
---
&gt; Eat an entire bag of dicks.
---
I would if you could keep your mouth off of them for 10 seconds. Since you can't, fuck off.
---
They have blast finishers and a number of the skills on elixer gun/heal kit count as elixers so the trait will grant might there as well.
---
Ele also has fire fields/blasts and its might tends to last a very long time &amp; when combined with +100% boon duration makes it allot easier.
---
For might capping guard also uses the empowering might trait. (heal on aegis break and staff trait are not worth using and even without them it still heals far more then enough
---
Sw0rly. The end result is you stop going to the restaurant entirely and you'll be the only one inside of it eating cold food as if you are paid to love the restaurant.   
---
You can defend a game but telling other people to grow up when you devalue time to such an extent is something else.  
---
Do you really game for a collectathon that was so lazy that the developers themselves didn't even add variance to the locations? 
---
I got the car that final fantasy XIV added in the final fantasy XV event. It was 200,000 MGP and I started off with only 1k. Working towards that with my mate was one of the most fun things we had done in final fantasy because there were so many memories we made during it.  
---
My friend who had less time compared to us cuz we were on a holiday did something else. She only took the weekly big burst events to eventually get the car.  
---
My last friend tried his best to avoid the temptation but then he caved in and did a mix of many events to eventually get the car.  
---
Every last one of us got the car in the end. Those who complained about the 200,000 MGP were told "Give it a shot at least"  
---
There are many cars in final fantasy and that's a limited time mount.   
---
But here's the thing. That was not a collectathon. That was actually a game.  
---
If your answer to this is "Go back to final fantasy"  
---
Yes exactly. That's exactly why people quit the game and only pop up from living world to living world to see if something changed.  
---
I'll be doing my fractals. I don't quit a game for one thing but people joined in for a skyscale because that's what EVERY advertisement was talking about. If Anet didn't hype up a mount to oblivion like this it would be fine. The mount isn't even secret. It was the only reason people got on.
---
&gt; "Whine" puts such a petulant tone on it.
---
Good, because it's being done in a very petulant way.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;"Express vocal criticism" is a much better phrasing.
---
Really, now?
---
There are objective facts that a person can relay, such as "ANet are the developers behind the Action MMORPG game Guild Wars 2". That is not my opinion, that is a verifiable fact that can be substantiated through multiple other avenues. I could not state that ANet was NOT the developer and try to claim that it was my personal opinion and therefore unfalsefiable.
---
I want my dragon, but this is a little crazy....
---
Agreed I heard I had to beat the story first and I usually like to play around he map and learn the events and things. Instead I plowed straight through the story and have barely touched map
---
Exactly. With the guide you don't have to spend a lot of time looking for stuff. Just spend a bit of time each day you play.
---
Por qué no los dos?
---
I killed the scarabs in Elon Riverlands.
---
At this point whole crystal armor fetish is getting annoying. Like we had 4? 5? crystal outfits in last 2 years? 
---
Basic shard armor is quite good, if only we had "Slumbering: upgraded armor set without shitty crystals all over plate.
---
Ah, the joy of being so new that I don't have to deal with this problem because I haven't even unlocked the raptor yet.
---
I will confess I didn't read the whole post but I think I understand the Idea from title and TLDR.  
---
And I agree with the general point. Would there be people jumping from a bridge in divinity without time gate? Yes, but there wouldn't be so many of them. Now new people that join the game are going to wonder wtf is going on for a few days.  
---
It made me consider joining them even tho I usually don't do this kind of stuff. Just because I feel like I need to finish it today to not be bothered by the collection any longe. Do I actually NEED to do it? No..? Maybe? I don't know why, but this reminded me of lootboxes and gambling, do people need to gamble?
---
Dry Top have lots of nodes and a rich one inside were the skritt queen is. And if you bought the crystal node from the festival you have that as well to gather every day.
---
Warnin !!!
---
This is not right, and it's not the same thing than nulifiction sigil
---
Grow Lamp will only go down in price because actually you can craft it for 15 gold, the only limitation is the charged cristal which is not worth 50 more gold. 
---
the price already going down.
---
So the advice is not to get them now but wait a few days that the hype goes down and the price go down
---
In gw2 you beat a "hard" raidboss once and there is no insentive to do it ever again (because no gear progression) for your weekly currency cap you just kill the easy bosses and youre fine.
---
"Worth to do it"  
---
I have a 100% map completion on a character. I'm mastery rank 283. I both have the griffon and the beetle. I have a guild i'm doing fractals with. I enjoy crafting ascended equipment and feeling like i'm working towards something.  
---
When I say this is a bit too much that has no value and i'm too entitled?   
---
You speak as if i've never gamed or played MMOs.   
---
But whatever. Enjoy your quality content. This is one thing I cannot see myself defending or caring about. Especially when the reward is a floating brick.
---
Raids are weekly gated, fractals are daily gated but the rotation changes a bit every week so you can experience all of it. Also a person isn't forced to do  only the daily fracs. And lastly legendaries are a different beast, they are completely horizontal progression it doesn't affect gameplay. Legendaries are also advertised to be hard to get, as a long-term goal. Mounts change gameplay and historically easy and fairly quick and sometimes fun to unlock. This guy who only plays once a week can experience all of raids or fractals in one day. legendaries, I agree, are a very long term goal for this guy but that's as advertised. Story and anything connected as the core experience are supposed to be casual friendly in gw. The gw2 philosophy was that you don't need to grind to experience the game.
---
i find that highly dubious but we'll see
---
Easy bosses give the same rewards as hard ones :)
---
It is a full collection that will take you time and gold. And since time was the issue here then i guess he did not find time for that either. Shit happens. Sometimes life don't let you play and sometimes it does. But you can not expect Arena Net to form their game around people who play a few hours here and there.
---
The home instance krait obelisk is what I use.
---
Is it better to start the skyscale now? I just finished the LWS3 story. I get distracted with nonstory content I enioy more, so it's taken a while. I have a raptor and a bunny though, because I tagged along when a friend did the first PoF instance.
---
From what I'm reading the skyscale seems like a long exp lockout for PoF forward, and requires some map meta. I don't mind the story spoilers. I have a lot of mastery tracks to complete still, so the exp wouldn't be a big deal. Plus the week(s) of timegate would be less noticeable while doing the PoF chapters. Would it be worth it to skip to the current LW chapter now? Can I even unlock the collections?
---
To be fair Trahearne actually did all the pact paperwork and organised the pact flagship. He may not have been a warrior, but he was a gentleman, an officer and a scholar.
---
Kormir was supposed to be a master tactician, but her habit of going tank mode in fights when she had to survive made me question her allegiance.
---
"Kormir must survive." is still a sequence of characters that makes me to worry.
---
*shock* you are right, damn it!
---
This post is a false generalisation.
---
I like to play stuff on my own time and pace, and I don't mind the Skyscale timegate. As a matter of fact, I'm looking forward to do something everyday besides just dailies.
---
&gt;Because it is wrong and bad. Imagine if it took 22 fucking days to get the weather report for today.
---
This is where I'm getting the "unjustified entitlement" from. Weather reports are generally services to the community sponsored by schools on government funding. GW2 is a **product**, it is being **sold** to us. We don't have any inherent right as to what content is available when.
---
We gave them money, we continue to give them money and time, and in exchange they provide us with virtual rewards after a certain amount of time spent completing virtual tasks. They give us a lot of options when it cones to the pace, a lot of times offering QoL or faster pace (Infinite gathering tools or Leveling Boosts), but they still decide what options we have available. And everyone's okay with that most of the time.
---
This time they put a specific form of optional content behind *obvious* timegates. What about the Fractal God title and the timegate behind it? T4 Fractals in general have a huge timegate behind them if you factor in the cost of a full ascended set plus Agony Resist.
---
My point is timegating, both direct and subtle forms of it, is part of everything in GW2; they made the choice to put X anoint of it here before optional content. If you don't want it, don't do it.
---
Oh thanks, i killed a bunch of them and got nothing so i though i was killing the wrong mob...
---
I believe they had to put some characters aside to explore new ones. I just hope they don't go straight for another dragon in the LS5 and develop more all characters and the changes they have been through, I want to see what is going to happen with Caithe and Aurene, Logan and Rytlock, Braham and Rox.
---
Does it die if I can't feed it on the 3rd day and have to restart again?
---
You’ll have to tell us if you’re playing dps or support chrono
---
Fractals are a bad joke. They are daily money grind dungeons without any difficulty whatsoever. So they are basically grind. But what for? You wont get better gear so you grind for money for skins.
---
CMs are a little better but still without a goal to grind for, why grind at all :D
---
Fuck that shit
---
Thank goodness, I was afraid no one was going to make a 16th thread about this subject today. You’ve allayed my fears.
---
Oof, okay. Guess I'll get started at some point.
---
Im still working through season 3 - completed PoF but I want to properly get through the story. No harm in preparing ahead of time though.
---
It is amazing how the hordes upvote anything that have to do with the skyscale without reslize that some posts are really not worth the upvote because they lack the meaning they are looking for.
---
I even lost track of how to calculate the total time, can someone do the math?
---
I can't even see myself bothering down the line, it's on the same level of aggravating as legendary weapons are for me now. I can fly the griffon pretty damned well, doubt I'll be missing much with the skyscale.
---
All for something that is STYILL inferior to a griffin. Garbage
---
So it's timed gated several years ? That's genius
---
A glory of dragons sounds leagues above a flock of them.
---
I suggest alt + f4 and uninstall and play a better game that lets you actually ... play.
---
Yeah, I've been worried about just how bleh flying it feels. Like, sure, it'll be 'better' with the masteries, but flying a griffon during the griffon collection was already SO MUCH FUN. Gliding, sans masteries, totally changed the experience of movement in the game. Pretty much all the mounts did-- the first time I did map completion in orr after mounts, it was SO NICE to just glide over the water on the skimmer, instead of fighting my way through underwater risene
---
The skyscale... so far, it's nice for precision landing on tiny platforms to pick up collection items? It's much slower than the springer for going up, and the griffon for going down. (or, like, jumping off and gliding before hitting something) I can see me being on the griffon, jumping off to glide, and using the skyscale to carefully land on a tiny platform.... and maybe climbing things?? but it's so clunky! And it's going to take more than a week before ANYONE has it for real, to tell us how the masteries improve the experience???
---
If you are an Altoholic and want to play every class gw2 is paradise btw :) Almost all endgame gear is account bouns so you can swap it around to whatever character you wakt to play currently. At some point you can even gear all classes in endgame gear pretty quickly (if you raid and do fractals regularly) thats my endgame goal to grind towards. I currrently have 32 characters and 16 of them are already in full ascended/endgame gear :)
---
There are kinda bad assumptions here most of the time. People get **super** defensive when it comes to guild wars 2.   
---
Not new to MMOs. Not new to guild wars either. I too have all the masteries in HoT. mastery rank 283 right now. I play many other games too. Even have played warframe.   
---
:D Fortuna was absolute hell to become old mate in.  
---
What you say isn't foreign to me considering i'm not a new player and not new to games wanting more of you.  
---
O.o But i'm not the only one snapping here. It's kinda alarming how demotivated players are becoming. Which is why the forum posts exist.  
---
This is not good game design. At all.  
---
Considering how cheap games are these days. Money can easily been put into something else. So any gemstore purchases for the skyscale mount are poofed.  
---
People don't play a game to feel this garbage. This is kinda something else.  
---
O.o i'm saying this knowing what you mean fully. Considering I also like having incentive and I still run around maps. I love PoF so much that regardless of reward I move around :D  
---
The choya stampede accidentally gave me one lodestone so I'd frequently check for those nice evergreens to craft a rune or two. Any excuse to PoF more.  
---
This a bad excuse to. Prolly only for me.  
---
Because of how bad the reception is and how demotivated the players around me became. &gt;\_&gt; I fear the response others will have as well. This was just a very bad welcome by Anet.  
---
My guild wants to just work up fractals exist and not even bother with open world. Which ruined the point of the mount which was supposed to encourage it.
---
God bless you from is kindness then :)
---
The LS maps are already restricted to only level 80 characters, you need to be level 80 to play that episode and unlock the map for that character or use a Portal Tome which can only be used by level 80 characters. They should add a filter to the "teleport to a friend" which doesn't allow you tp to someone if you don't match the minimum level for that map.
---
Dungeons aren't timegated, though? Not sure about the other two, but you can repeat dungeons as often as you want.
---
Very much so!
---
I'm surprised to see the Stellar set make it into the Guaranteed Wardrobe. I wonder if the Heroic Dragonsblood set will make it in later. Might save the pain of making those.
---
Yea, in the content drought of early 2019 I basically logged on once a week to do a full clear, and lots of my guildies did the same.
---
I think the issue is that the Skyscale was advertised as one of the big features for the release, so people expect to be able to use it pretty fast. It wasn't framed as something you'd slowly grow over time (like Mawdrey for example), but as a new mount you'd get similarly to the beetle.
---
Hey if that's what you want to do. Cause apparently there is nothing else to do in the new release or gw2 as a whole outside of one collection lmao
---
I'm not understanding this disconnect between having the goal of the Skyscale and that being a valid reason to want to log in and play every day.
---
You aren't forced to do it every day. Do your collection as you feel like it, then go off and do other things that you want to do. If you log in one day and think "gosh I don't want to do the Skyscale stuff today" you're able to take a break and come back to it tomorrow, or next week.
---
The only people who are really getting burnt here are the people who want it immediately. :/
---
&gt; Im still working through season 3 - completed PoF but I want to properly get through the story. 
---
You kinda need to. The collection requires to do thigns that are only possible after the story is properly done. It takes throughout all season 3 maps and even bitterfront frontier at some point.
---
If you don't have bitterfrost fonrtier you need to wait for the claw of jormag fight to freeze you to progress a certain part.
---
Ofc people will get it in the end. The map is the new farm map anyway so they will have everything unlocked anyway and then keep on farming it and wonder why they were whining about it in the first place.
---
Do you happen to have the source for this? I‘m always interested in learning stuff I didn‘t know!
---
I left XIV because of that shit.
---
And you act like SE hasn't had layoffs and that padding somehow alleviates that.
---
Making people wait to play your game isnt how you keep people playing. It's how you keep people subbed since they can't get their resets otherwise. In essence, you're making people pay to wait. Might as well play another game in between resets  instead of you know, playing the game.
---
The average person will pay more through subs and xpacs on XIV alone than even the average whale will spend on GW2
---
Can say that about pretty much every aspect of gw2 though
---
&gt; according to the majority of the world population
---
What do you think "according to" means?
---
Could someone link best guides for this?
---
[deleted]
---
The Goddess of Guidance perhaps?
---
There is not effort to it and anyone trying to justify it are only lying to themselves. Anet's dependency on timegating has gotten worse over the years. It's lazy design, full stop.
---
Well I didn't design anything but I dont have to - I'm not getting paid for doing it. But I'm in fact interested in game design (and have been for a while now), I'm actively following stuff like gamasutra, gdc or digital dragons. You don't really need to be a game designer to realize how well something is designed tho - you just need to observe how others react to it.
---
Remember original HoT?   
---
.\_. I'll be happy if I see a 17th and 18th and 19th thread like this so it goes up the priority list.  
---
That's the whole point anyways.   
---
Considering each day there's a new thing to be amazed about. Expect this happening a lot. Part 4 was a doozy.
---
So what you're saying is they pulled a Syrio Forel on Phlunt. Not today.
---
I assume it was Bloodstone Fen. The map can only be reached at level 80 (but I assume Teleport to Friend disabled this) and has no hearts so it was incredibly easy to complete in a matter of minutes. No other map (other than Dragonfall, which is probably a lot longer to complete because it's huge and complex) has the same problem.
---
Unfortunately I think this means they will remove the key from Bloodstone Fen's loot table.
---
&gt;But does these sales a regular thing?
---
Expansion sales happen every month or two right now. 
---
&gt; Or is there any news from a new expansion 
---
Quite the opposite.  We know Living World Season 5 is up next, so we probably have at least a year before the next expansion is on the radar.
---
&gt; Also I see that living stories can be bought with gems. I'm not yet familiar with the economics in gw2, how hard is to farm / playing the ah to get enough gold for them? 
---
 I would suggest just buying gems for living world, as your gold early on is better spent elsewhere (Ascended armor/weapons) but if you're willing to put aside other things you could spend your money on for a bit, it's certainly doable.
---
Playing the TP (Called the AH in other games) takes patience or game knowledge.  I find GW2 one of the easier markets to make small profits on, but one of the harder markets to get rich on.
---
Honestly ArenaNet can suck my dick, timegates, legenadry grinding, grind grind, grind some more. This game is a gemstore with a cookie clicker addon.
---
Griffon takes literally one or two days if you have saved gold. Beetle took me 2 days as well. Not at all comparable.
---
This just goes to show why the story always feels so rushed. They change it as they go! I would have much rather had this for the first 3 episodes then Joko, then Kralky in Season 5. Makes me wonder why they would have accelerated it so much. Maybe Anet should learn how to apply timegating to the story rather than the content! Thanks for all the work you do and how you protect the story when it's live. Also thanks for the only interesting post all week!!
---
i cant tell but probably wow, i guess !
---
i dont know WoW well i just go to level 40 something like this and it was way enough to see how shit this game is.
---
People dont keep playing wow because it"s good, they play it because they play it for a long time, they dont want to move to an other game after all the time they have put in it, they are emotionally attached to this game. I understand that , i really do.

But cmon World of warcaft ? in 2019 ? Graphics are shit , combat is shit ... for me this has been stuck in 2005 for to many years
---
&gt; And yet, after a while players complained about that there is "nothing left to do". Some already complain about that there is not enough stuff to do and you can do the events as many times as you like, they still will get boring after a while.
---
It is problem of PoF design. People still play HoT metas because they somewhat interesting and rewarding you toward ultimate shines (gen 2 legendary weapons). PoF just offer nothing to any established player aside 1 play-through.

Asura Moon Base first.

If you want results, post this on the Anet forum. Posting it here is just attempting to get in on the circlejerk.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Exactly and why you play gw2 is because you adore the world/story/lore or the combat/buildcrafting. Endgame content is pretty sparse and without the aforementioned insentives rather repulsive/useless/repetitive/shortlived.
---
I would not use the boost on your current lvl 57 character, I find it a waste as you're already quite high level. (it would jump 23 levels, instead of 78 when used on a new character)
---
I'd continue leveling/map-exploring/dungeons and you'll hit lvl 80 in no time.
---
Instead you can boost a new character you might like. You can even test the level 80 character before you accept the boost on him. 
---
But if you have no interest in a new character and want to be 80 asap, then do what you find best.
---
It's a waste on a level 57, the content only gets better from 80 onwards! But i'd say keep leveling, enjoy the game and learn. 80 content, especially HoT can be overwhelming, level naturally and save the 80 boost for maybe next profession you wanna play.

This  is a guide for the "Skyscale Eggs" achievement. Map routes and  video  routes are included as well as timestamps below. They  go from one  to  the next in an easy to follow way except where the map has been  reset  or its easier to just go to the closer waypoint. (These might not  be  the best ways of getting there as the map is quiet recent, but  learning  you're way around will get easier with time.)

---
that's just gross m8
---
Just about learning tells, positioning, when to dodge etc. Also learn what block abilities you have.
---
you can grind CM for red infusion
---
It's just temporary until they fix the exploit.
---
It seems to be that the crystal dragons all knew that their reality is pre-planned and that they have inescapable roles to play. Kralky probably did all the things he did because he was to do all of the things he did. 
---
It's possible that all of the Dragons and their more powerful minions like the Pale Tree have the same gift to a lesser extent: "Do not question the Dream. We must all play our parts."
---
The griffon has multiple collections. It involves a scavenger hunt for eggs on all 5 POF maps. Several events. A bounty and 250 gold on top of that, each behind a heart.  Then there's a couple of instances as well.  
---
It can be done in a day or two following a guide, but it's definitely not just gold.  It is, however, not time gated.
---
You can grind anything for skins/cosmetics.
---
&gt; it was said to be cut late in production so the story wouldn't drag on too long.
---
But... that would have been great.
---
I used to have this problem. I don't know what others would suggest but my solution was to just wear a few pieces of equipment with vitality on it for open-world PVE roaming, and switch back to Berserker equipment for other content.
---
It helps a lot to not get randomly one-shotted by things you weren't even aware were you aggro'd.
---
I'm glad that they didn't make Phlunt the obvious villain and associated with the Inquest. Sometimes people are just dicks and antagonistic without being a moustache twirling, evil plotting, bad guy.
---
Uh, artificially bloating time between mundane tasks is hardly content.
---
Exactly and I'm saying this as a filthy casual and darn proud of it.
---
I know people aren't going to like what I say, but I feel like we should consider the Charged Quartz as a more flexible time gate.  Unlike with the feeding the hatchlings, you can at least shorter the 22 days for the crystals:
---
\- Charge 25 per day at an HP
---
\- Pop a guild booster for rare resources and mine a home instance for a chance at one daily
---
\- Open Wintersday presents
---
While I'm sure no one likes any of these options, I feel like this is important to remember since 22 days for that step is at least partially flexible (outside of buying the lamp outright, of course)
---
So play at your own pace. How does the time gate help with any of that? You will still play like you do but it's just pure annoyance for players who would like to commit more time to this in shorter span.
---
well, i got there, i had time to do the heart, go to the heart vendor, go back, look on the wiki then i'd say i waited 5-10 MORE mins, then the even started which took about 4-5 mins in it self as it is countdown style event, so cant cheese it to speed it up. i am think it maybe on a 15 or 30 min cycle,
---
It gives you a reason to log in again on another day, and spreads the content out a little. It's nice to have something to work on each day, and know there's still something for you tomorrow alongside metas and such. Some people just want to race to the finish line as fast as possible, sitting in the backseat with their guides or Taco doing everything for them, only to whine about how not having anything to do when they inevitably exhaust the rewards in half an hour. I feel sorry for them. It's okay to slow down sometimes.
---
It really doesn't matter if you get your reward in a few days or right now. It's not like it's required for any content anyway.
---
Speaking personally, it also gives me no satisfaction when I'm finally done with a time gated accomplishment like this.  If there was an actual challenge we needed to overcome, or even a lengthy grind (ideally devoid of RNG), then getting it would feel great.  But with timegated BS like this? When I am finally finished, all I feel is relief because it's finally over.
---
Oh? Unlike warframe the reddit doesn't get the same attention?   
---
.\_. Why didn't anyone say so before.  
---
No seriously. I could of just made the post there fam.
---
Xd that's horrible but accurate
---
So this is about you? You had all the gold, what about those that did not? Or is the issue here that Arena Net don't make the game exactly how you want it to be so it suits you? If so what about the players who have no isses with doing this? If we look in a few weeks the skyscale will be every were and the horde on reddit will also sit on them. So to me this is just silly because Arena Net can not make one game for each person. It is a impossible task. And with Kourna just a few chapters back they are trying to avoid what happen then, and now the horde is here to tell them it is bad to have to much. 
---
Anyway i have not intentions to discuss this. I can not bring my self to take it serious because what i see is Arena Net trying to avoid what happen on the Kourna map. That is a good thing. It can not hit right for everybody, and that is just how life is.
---
Wtf i dont understand the Day 2 Guide
---
This a super disproportional rant for a few days wait on a bonus mount
---
They canceled their mobile projects and the devs from those projects were incorporated into gw2 development leading to mobile game style additions to gw2. Time gating is a central part of mobile game development to increase what they call "engagement". This is probably the result of these shit-tier devs being put into the gw2 team
---
Let's not kid ourselves; there *isn't* any way to keep people playing for **three months** without either using some form of timegating, implementing a Korean level of grind, or making all the content be Savage/Ultimate-level difficulty. Stop and remember what percent of the playerbase actually engages in - and completes - Savage/Ultimate-level content. In case you forgot, I'll remind you: *it's a small percentage.*
---
I'm not a fan of time-gating. It's boring. It's also better than the alternatives of "oh my god everything is super-hard" or "oh my god everything is super-grindy".
---
&gt;Might as well play another game in between resets instead of you know, playing the game.
---
Yoshi-P himself has said that if you're bored of XIV, feel free to unsub for a while and come back when the game has something that interests you.
---
Spirit shards from POF maps and raids are relevant though. You can't get those anymore until you do the Skyscale collection *all the way through*.
---
That's the real reason Thor retired to drink beers with Korg. Forgal has that shit handled.
---
That's a relief then. I just now finished getting scales and have to buy medicine. The vendors won't talk to me until I do lanes. I have no idea what lanes are.   =/
---
I'd really like if one of the lore folks could make a chart or something breaking down magic in Tyria. 
---
It's pretty confusing these days, which I guess is kinda the point, but I'm lost between the old schools that were controlled by the bloodstone, each dragon having two aspects, gods having two aspects, chak filtering out corrupted dragon magic (would they filter out god aspects?) Also, if eating Joko made Aurene get his immortality, does that mean it wasn't a fancy spell but a fundamental aspect of his? How'd that happen? Why didn't Zhaitain have that kinda mojo?
---
I feel like we need to put Taimi back into Rata Novus for our lore dumps.
---
And Season 5 as well since it is PoF mastery era as well. Good luck with no XP for 6 episodes x 5 month.
---
I really love your site, tyvm for your work and dedication.
---
If u dont mind me make a suggestion, could we get an option to see the skins that arent in the wardrob unlock in the analyse like we have in the browse. Again tyvm.
---
Thanks a lot for your iinput :)
---
For *new* support chrono, run more diviner than SC tells you.
---
Like, a lot more. SC builds are min-maxed. They minimize the amount of boon duration needed to upkeep your boons to squeeze out all possible dps from the support class. If you're not as skilled as SC's chronos (you aren't), run as much Diviners as you can. Upkeeping your boons is much much much more important than the potential DPS gain of mixing in berserker.
---
Why would you ever use it other than to afk?
---
If you don't have the time you don't have the time. It is the same thing. If you are stopped by real life and there for have very little time then farming gold or making a collection is not difference it is about the time.
---
True, i find pretty shit the fact that you are limited to go up with the second energy bar.
---
It's a dragon ffs, it can go up the way it want ...
---
\+ your energy dont go up when your attached on a wall..
---
There is mastery for it to recharge it's Air Juice (green-bar) mid air by flying through something, i believe.
---
Down to 50g from 100? Before the daily reset yesterday the cost about 15g. They spiked up as the first wave of players learned about the need to buy them. They will do so again every daily reset for quite some time.
---
Eh. Saying "this time is different' has no value since I had your stance through everything myself.
---
All the mounts that were advertised were possible to get unlike this mount. The griffon was a secret mount but seriously. Eh. 
---
For those who can complete the collection. All good. Since Anet doesn't read reddit ( glad someone pointed that out ) i'll just see if the official forums has a backclash. If it does. Nothing much to worry about. I'll play something else instead.
---
My guild is a very small group and us suddenly leaving will do no harm to the servers. So worst case scenario and everything suddenly became uninteresting. We yeet.
---
Christ.  Like, I get why timegates exist: they help get players invested and help to put rich and poor players on a more equal footing.  However, if you've got a fucking matryoshka doll of timegates...you really need to rethink your design.
---
"kinda cool" doesn't justify putting up with all this
---
To Sum this up in more aggressive language   
---
 ***We want CONTENT , Anet... not more grind.*** 
---
Requiring other maps / events was a nice touch. However, they could have incentivized us to play the neglected content by literally  making the rewards worth looking at.   
---
There's  a reason everyone stays in the silverwastes, because it takes a fuckoff massive amount of gold to get anything done, and after you're happy and done exploring the world, it's the objective BEST way to do it ( Barring T4 Fracs but that has a cost in agony resistance and a lot of practice to know what the fuck to do )
---
I'm glad they didn't go with Phlunt as a villain. GW2's story is painfully one dimensional and story telling is so much better when it challenges you.
---
I'd rather see characters like Phlunt be on the side of the angels even if they so heavily position us to dislike them. Phlunt is constantly used to pander to the Taimi fans and pulling him out here as a villain would have sucked.
---
yeah, don't try to improve the game for the future /s
---
I'm really enjoying the Skyscale quest, I like having an excuse to explore and revisit older content. That said, I do agree that the timegating could be an issue for several reasons. For instance, if you want to work toward getting the Skyscale with friends, you're cut off from each other's progress and forced to stop at particular times by artificial stopping points instead of being able to decide for yourselves when you've done enough.
---
Another issue is that while I'm happy to enjoy the content for its own sake, a lot of people just want the mount and would rather rush to the end of the collection, which they can't do if it's timegated. In all honesty I don't love the idea of rushing through content with a guide up on the second screen, for me it cheapens it, but it's not for me to tell other people how they should have fun; if they want to rush it then let them rush it.
---
In short, I love the content, but the timegates are doing more harm than good.
---
Aka - 22 total if starting from scratch.
---
So that, instead of complaining about timegates, people can burn through the content and complain that they've already done everything?
---
great, how about ppl that have different time and pace than you? some ppl wanna go fast. you only dont mind because you're slow and enjoy being slow.
---
\&gt; punishing the most loyal fans 
---
Are we all children now? Not getting what you want when you want it =/= being punished.
---
[Domination build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/) just you're running the lower damage focus instead of sword. [DPS video rotation is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5ER-QS1dWo).
---
It recharges when you fly through VM even without masteries.  Unless you’re thinking of something else.
---
Yes. Need a target. Like when trying to use a phantasm skill without a target.
---
&gt; No, but your "so-and-so is shit at X" loses most of its merit if you haven't ever even done X yourself.
---
Well, no. I can say a buildings designed by X look like shit or are designed like shit and I wouldn't be neccessarily wrong even if I haven't done any building design myself.
---
ANet designs their content like they'd be developing a single player game for 5 years olds or bunch of monkeys that have no opinion or basic logic skills. Therefore their content they're producing in context of MMORPG game they're producing it for is just not good.
---
Imagine Anet Twitch going apeshit on Guildchat Timescale in May 24th when 95-100% of playerbase still do not have Gatescale.
---
There is a lot fo endgame content 
---
When i mean Endgame it's already that you have put a good 1000 hours in the game
---
It is unclear if it's absolutely the first, but it's the first one from the perspective of the 6 gods.
---
The problem is that anet approaches the grind completely wrong. Instead of having to grind for content that gives players the agency to choose what content they want to grind for, they make the grind solely time-based. They could have set some high target such as requiring 2000 of the new map currency, or completing 100 or even 300 events. Such a grind gives the player the freedom to choose to play while being able to actually enjoy the bulk of the content that is given. The way time-gates work is that they basically make up for a lack of content. Instead of encouraging you to play and grind for a certain item, they are telling you that you can't keep grinding for a certain item anymore until the next day. As an mmo, I think the ability for players to choose the goals they set is vital to the success in an mmo. With such a time-gate, it simply just kills motivation into obtaining new goals.
---
You need to go to the Sun's Refuge which you can't if you only have episode 6.
---
Do you have autotarget on or some other settings which might interfere?
---
Not those, these are kinda like rippling in the air. If you pass through them with a Skyscale, a notice appear about the Masteries.
---
I don't think I understand what you mean by "The situation looks fine", cause what it actually sounds like is "The fact ArenaNet introduced a hefty timegate is finy"
---
It can hover so it 'can' stay in the air longer than a griffon, but so far with the rental skyscale I haven't seen much use to it compared to a griffon other than "Look mom I got a new mount".  I would hope the masteries associated with it prove useful.  Similar to that issue is warclaw; it may be a wvw mount, but it has no usefulness outside wvw, some non-wvw masteries might help.
---
Name me two games that are fundamentally different. As in, not employing either timegates or grind.
---
Ready, go.
---
Since we are [memeing](https://imgur.com/a/9kZX9gK) this...
---
because it's a cool mount
---
And the Karka.  They attacked LA because they were fleeing their home in the ocean.
---
Except this is the opposite of the truth.  You have a pretty limited amount of horizontal traversal before you run out of "flight meter" and start descending. The main thing it *does* do better than the Griffon is gain altitude, since your flight meter gives you a higher vertical than a griffon wing flap, and the final mastery lets you use your stamina to recharge your flight meter while gripping onto walls, and lets you leap off the walls for even more vertical gains.  Besides that, the only other thing it does better than the griffon, is you can hover in place with it, and that's not particularly useful outside of the last part of Dragonfall's meta.
---
"Give me everything I want right now. Give me the elite specs instantly. No, I don't want to work out anything myself, I'll follow a commander. I'll also use taco to show me where the collection items are."
---
30 minutes later...
---
"This patch was so small, the map is boring and there's nothing to do. I finished everything in one night and now we have to wait for another 3 months? We need more content, the release schedule isn't working!"
---
I think there's a mastery for regaining energy while sticking to the wall
---
Not to mention you can get quartz from the home instance (rare chance) and from wintersday presents (rare chance) so the people doing the home instance can shorter their time gate of crystals.
---
As I see it, there are 3 ways with minimal effort to get charged quartz, but only 1 way with minimal effort for the Nulls. (leveling a toon to 64)
---
I get that it sucks to have to find a node and attune your crystals, but I don't see it any worse then the people that had to do this for their celestial eles a few years ago before stat changing asc was a thing.
---
If you take a look at your achievement panel there are 3 achievements for doing 10 (of any) events in the 3 regions. These also give you access to the vendors. Just try and play the map meta and you will get it naturally. The map meta is pretty rewarding and fun anyways.
---
are you talking about the ley-lines perhaps?
---
&gt; I like to play stuff on my own time and pace,
---
So does everyone who hates time gates. They want to play at their own pace but are being told by an artificial time gate that they are not allowed to. What you value is exactly what other people value.
---
I don't personally see anything worth getting outraged about in any of this. I'm not going to write a big thing justifying my personal opinion when it is, in fact, my personal opinion.
---
it was confirmed ls5 will be before any more expansions if there are any
---
Casual friendly game btw.
---
If it's timegated, you should be keeping a surplus for just such an occasion.
---
I seriously regret helping a friend play through the story a second time on launch night and later taking my time to find the scavenger hunt items on my own. I finished the story early and was able to work on Skyscale collections (without a guide) but a friend logged in later and I did the story with him again. I ended up finishing the collection 31 minutes after reset before I knew it was time gated.
---
I'm not a day behind everyone else and finding out about items which are spiking severely in price as others get to the next collections before I can because I literally had to wait 23 hours and 29 minutes to continue. It was also a HUUUGE handbreak on my personal hype train for the collection sitting for 24 hours after the episode released, completely unable to do any progression on the collection because I was smelling the roses.
---
There is no 'exploit'.  You have been able to get to Bloodstone Fen via TP to Friend forever.
---
&gt; They showed us the mount as if it would be unlocked with the new episode but instead you need to have ALL of LWS4 finished.
---
No, they didn't. They just showed us the mount. I get the timegate disaproval but complaining because you have to actually get the stuff in game makes zero sense.
---
Dulfy's done a lot for the community, and a guide is certainly a life-saver if you're stuck on a particular part of a collection long enough for the fun to cease, but a large part of me wants to see the community freak the hell out if she doesn't return from her career break. "Wait, I have to actually \*play\* the game?"
---
They'd be dumbfounded. Their world would end.
---
Should I even bother with this skyscale collection?  I took one look after finishing the story, went "nope" and logged off. Do people figure that it will become as vital as the griffon or just an alternative preference?
---
I'm calling it now: Legendary Ring collection from next raid will require 1000 Legendary Divinations xd
---
&gt;pressing F once every day for a month is playable content
---
You access the endgame content within a month of playing easily. Expecially with a mmo background. You are raid ready in under 100h playtime easily.
---
Soo... anyone here tried FFXIV? Opinions?
---
That’s a super bad comparison. Every day of learning the piano rewards you with knowledge. Why this collections doesn’t even give any reward before you do all 5.
---
And piano doesn’t lock itself after some time that you played during that day. If i want, I can play 10 hours. Because i like so and because I WANT. This collection doesn’t let me progress anyhow after a certain mark, no matter how much i want to.
---
&gt; It is the same thing.
---
It's not. Let's say you can play 10 hours on Saturday but not otherwise. Griffon would take 2 Saturdays max if you have the gold (and 250 isn't *that* much to have if you don't waste it around and instead let it accumulate) while skyscale will take literally months because you can only do a small chunk per day and then stop.
---
The problem is, with griffon and beetle the choice of pace is yours. With skyscale they're forcing a schedule that in best case scenario is only a little inconvenience but it's a total disaster for those who do have decent time to play but only in the form of weekly binge sessions.
---
Let's say there were 5 daily time gates (I think there's more but for simplicity's sake) and each daily collection would take 2 hours.
---
Person 1 plays 2 hours per day for 5 days = 10 hours. He would have the mount after 5 days
---
Person 2 normally plays the same 10 hours in one go on Saturday. Now he can only do "2 hours" of the collection during that day and has to wait until next week. Result: person 2 will only have the mount after 5 weeks.
---
Both people played the exact same number of hours but person 2 will need 7 to wait 7 times longer in order to get the mount. All this because of an arbitrary limitation they're forcing on us.
---
And you're saying this is not a problem?
---
Just to point out:
---
&gt; hang onto them just a little while because we have a deep dive **Guild Chat episode about the skyscale coming up on May 24**.
---
Can you repeat the question?
---
I do personally, I have enough for this section plus some. Just thinking generally
---
The armor set sucks tho. The only good parts are the chest and pants for heavy and medium. Everything else is so boring and overdone. Theres already crystal sets in the game. The regular not blooming mist whatever parts look better.
---
Ok, and?  You could use this same argument for them to never ever ever release any updates, because as soon as the updates hit a massive amount of people all go to wherever the new content is.
---
I don't know.
---
Bond of faith and oakleheart essences were more useful to me than skyscale.
---
I am quite sure that won't end well. *insert Trahearne*
---
OMG that item again...
---
Its a good thing I kept making Charged crystals every day since I started with the ascended plant back pack that used that item...
---
Dragons feed on magic- I hope they do interact with ley lines!
---
Wow, such a detailed response. I'm the type of person that doesn't like much of the grindy-ness (which is a bad trait to have in an MMORPG). I'm really glad that you wrote this, since I had no idea Elementalist had so many things to think about, such as how Tempest or Weaver works, although I still have no idea what type of weapon to use yet, but it's just me not experimenting as much. Thank you so much, I think I'll just keep the Boost 'till I'm  more used to how the Elementalist works, since I'm really dedicated towards the character already and I really like being an Elementalist.
---
This needs to be heard. I‘m one of those young adults and so far I‘m keeping up with the collection, but for people like you this is just straight up shit. It feels like anet does not acknowledge people with actual jobs and real life. This feels like content for hardcore players only. I really don‘t like this update.
---
There's dozens of time gates between your current position and skyscale so I'd say not to bother with it. You can start charging your quartz though.
---
Exactly. Time gating doesn’t actually keep players engaged - it creates the illusion of engagement by forcing players to disengage from what they actually want to do and come back the next day in order to make a bit more incremental progress.
---
It’s why I think the Griffon is a great example of content done right, there’s little to no gating, and while it was a gold sink once you got it you wanted to try it out in all sorts of places. I got mine and played more consistently during that time period than any other, simply because I enjoyed the griffon. I’d find excuses to farm content that I’d already played hundreds of times just to fly around some more.
---
Skyscale? Just makes me want to shut off the game and play something else.
---
Ruby has already repeated herself twice that there will be no skyscale dev on the first pannel.
---
That room was kinky.
---
Great job guys, love the harmonized lead.
---
Please never be a game dev.
---
Gw1 had no timegates and literally 1 unique drop per dungeon. They are still being cleared today because they are FUN
---
You know what happens after you've done a raid wing ? You don't touch it again for a week because you get the same reward you'd get opening 5 chests in ab/vb
---
Timegates are plain bad, they handicap the players who want to invest time and don't do anything for those who don't want to
---
It seems that most, if not everyone recommend me to just save it, which I now whole-heartedly agree. I just got really impatient and was really curious about how Tempest and Weaver work. I will just save it towards another character when I feel like I know the basics of most things.
---
But I *want* to finish it asap so I can quit the game again for 3 months. Doing this is a chore. It would be another story if the content was actually fun.
---
Yes it is quite good to both elite specs are almost equally viable, tho deadeye is more single target while daredevil and the staff is better against multi targets
---
Best advice I can give you,
---
Read tooltips! If skills and traits, if you copy builds from other players try to understand the reasoning behind the choice of traits.
---
It's like the largest hurdle to claim with the most reward :D
---
This pls
---
So many people in this thread don't understand the purpose of mounts in GW2 at all.
---
In this case, you don't really need any guides. The achievement panel for Dragonfall lists the tasks via achievements; meaning, for the gloves, you need to complete the 25 bridge events (Infrastructure) and for another, you need to visit the 8 waterfalls in Melandru's region to unlock the helm (which, does have a small guide recently posted here on Reddit). 
---
The others are completing 10 events down each path and the final is beating all the champions on the map (again, with a list provided in the achievements) which is fairly easy although will take a couple of tries unless you get lucky to tag all the bosses after the main fight.
---
Get your rotting corpses... OFF... MY... CHEST!
---
If the skyscale didn't exist, you also would be getting "no xp" (which is to say, you're actually getting xp towards a hidden bar for spirit shards, which you can do fuck all with especially when you're already not playing much).  The skyscale is clearly not required content to experience the story, much like the beetle and the griffon before it.
---
It's ToS compliant, just like TacO. Sorry bub
---
No, your home instance and wintersday presents have a chance to drop the charged quartz
---
Is that the only thing there is to do in this update?
---
Okay. I'm pissed. I don't mind the huge collection hunt because I figure I could do it on the long weekend coming up, but a **FIVE DAY** timegate?! Really?! Which moron thought this was a good idea??? I don't think I'm alone when I say that with work and other obligations, realistically, and barring holiday weekends, I only have about ONE day per week to log in and play, so Anet is expecting people like me to wait five WEEKS to unlock the new mount? On a map that functions like Dragon's Stand? That has little to no replay value (beyond getting the mount. Look at Domain of Kourna...) and **probably** won't have much players after two weeks or a month from now?? Yeah, fuck the jackass who decided this.
---
I get that they're trying to extend the life of game content, but pointless busywork artificially dragged on by a timegate is NOT how to do it. Content that's actually FUN and with replay value is how they should have gone about with it.
---
I've really enjoyed scavenging around the new map and then taking eggs to interesting places, and while I haven't found the time-gaming that bothersome yet, I can see how it could be annoying. Mostly the time gates just feel unnecessary, like what are they adding to the enjoyment?
---
Hey why not quit the game now and save yourself some grief
---
They haven't confirmed anything, but the numbers over the past few years don't lie: Living World content maintains spending, but Expansion content boosts it. They'll definitely do an expansion again, we just don't know when, and we probably wont' know until we're about to get it (like PoF).
---
Those other answers are good, but also you can swap the sword for a scepter and to great ranged dps.
---
The timegated shit is utter garbage but complaining about being 12min late is ridiculous. You could have just opened a guide for the last few eggs to speed it up since you know when the reset is
---
You may want to replay that instance. Phlunt only comes back to protect and secure his research which is in the room being attacked.
---
I've seen that and I understand what you mean x_x
---
It's fine. 
---
Progress through the achievements for now :D
---
Mind if I add ya? I'd like feedback on how it was for you over the months. 
---
Since I don't wanna do it anymore at least from you I can maybe understand Anet's design philosophy behind it.
---
But you can meet the new mount since release.
---
I've met it and flown around on it a lot on the new map.
---
It's not false marketing.
---
That's nothing new. I got the Luminescent armor set through wardrobe unlocks.
---
If you don't have charged crystals or don't want to wait doing them, it cost around as much as the griffon right now. It is 12x6g plus 60g for the grown lamp. I can see it spiking even further tomorrow or at least this week then a steady decline, but i don't see this being cheap anytime soon, at least not below 50g
---
I don't think that is quite true. Guild Wars 2 is a game that is very good at giving you *stuff* but that stuff is generally interchangeable. The ascended item you get from pristine fractal relics is effectively the same as the one you get from raiding. The gold you get from Istan is the same as from HoT metas or Silverwastes. It is very easy to fall into a routine of only doing what is most routine to get that stuff.
---
With the Skyscale I'm encouraged, for what is apparently a whopping 5 days, to do some new stuff, see a new map and actually play that content. It is a strategy that is already working for me since I actually want to play the new map and work towards the Skyscale and gradually go back and revisit previous LS maps. In that way, the content is going to last massively longer for me than the three hours it took me to do the Thunderhead Peaks story and map completion.
---
If it wasn't timegated, I'd settle down on a Friday night and do everything in one go - just as I did for the griffon and the beetle.
---
I'm definitely not a fan of time gating when it hinders an individuals ability to access content or keep up competitively with others but as the Skyscale is optional, as there are plenty of otherways to get around the new map and and as other mounts combine for much of the same effect I really don't see the issue with a very, very minor time gate. Then again, I enjoy the idea of gradual progress and it seems the Guild Wars 2 community considers this anathema.
---
Jeez. Its been a few years. If you gimme your ingame name (DM, obv.), Im gonna send you 30g to at least some floating money and not bankrupt yourself over the new skyscale.
---
Agree completely. You, I like you.
---
LMAOOO
---
Just park a character at each of the four bridges and check every now and then. I got done fairly easily that way rather than joining a bridge squad map waiting and "playing nice" with everyone by auto-attacking and again, waiting for people to get there.
---
You are right. I don't have any motivation to even start the process, from what experience I have had with it. Also, and this obviously doesn't apply to most, but I'm a returning player from a significant break, and while I did it for the lackluster beetle mount, I'm not inclined to purchase more content (additional chapters I missed this season) just to fill out the reqs for this mount. I might spend some time in the meta for a bit, and possibly work on the armor, but I don't feel like I'll be hanging around the new content much.
---
One could say, the backlash response is timegated... x)
---
Sunstone lumps jumped in price too.
---
What do You mean by charging quartz
---
Well, I'm pretty flacid seeing all these timegates.
---
Looks like the mobile game department got their nasty hands in GW2. Go away you fiends!
---
Tengu focussed Cantha, little did we know they spread  avian flu to the human population through then ministry of Purity and then wiped them off the map. We get there via the Dominion of the four Winds, a forward scouting base to spread lies about how Cantha is still _fine_ but unfortunately itll suffer a wall failure from a destroyer attack soon, which is how we enter and find out the sham that is Tengu Public Relations.
---
Pls let the free mount stay crappier than the 250 gold mount!
---
I still don’t understand how Kralkatorrik, juiced up with magic, and crash landed right next door to the Deep Sea dragons location, whilst also pulling down portions of the Gods realms, failed to draw even a slight bit of interest from the Water Dragon.
---
That much magic washing around, and it does nothing? Come on.
---
I’m telling you, they are going to Malyck the DSD, and retcon it out of existence.
---
This exactly.
---
Yeah I know, I'm just saying it's never given after getting a new mastery, or at any other time. So if I ever finish the lines, if this is how it works, I'm going to get an inventory full of em.
---
It also promotes a massive amount of bitterness from the bad memories ensuring the players will never want to go back there.
---
/r/guildwars2 beside itself. Driving around downtown Tyria begging (thru texts) map chat 4 address to Dulfy's guides
---
Ah you said "autoattack" not "autotarget". With autotarget off have you tried the "deselect target" keybind (worst case spam Escape) and then either clicking or tab-targeting while looking in the direction Aurene is facing/flying?
---
The only issue I personally noticed was getting LoS'd on *specific* weakspots by Kralk's own body but most I could just blast with impunity.
---
Really depends on how you play the game , if you rush just to play raid ill say yes , but i got a frined which has 1600 hours in the game only doing pve and has never done any raids, and still not ready for fractal T4
---
I could totally go with Phlunt being actually a secret inquest operative, but changing his ways after meeting with Taimi and the rest, and splitting from the Inquest along other Inquest deserters like Codename: R3D-RCR.
---
They would still operate in the grey areas of science, but they would be less murdery, experiment only with volunteers and dirty their hands only for a good cause. 
---
Kind of like the Ash Legion, Hassassin Order, or Section 31 of the asura society.
---
Good fucking luck monetizing the Skyscale skins Anet, because I'm not going to bother with this crap or spend another dime on a game that can't seem to respect my time. Pointless busywork and unnecessary timegates for a mount they expect and hope players will spend money on for skins...
---
So this collection is sigil of null all over?
---
Can I have your stuff? ;)
---
But people complain there isn't enough content to be hooked on the game 24/7.
---
Yeah, as would I. I bit the bullet, and purchased the chapters required for the lackluster beetle. But I am not feeling too inclined to do that again, right now. Disappointing.
---
I honestly understood it as him saying that huge amount of power in itself is corrupting and that Aurene is first succesful try at making being that is immune to going mad from magic overload.
---
Other thing is that from story telling perspective using one dragon to solve 4 of our problems (Balth's magic, Mordremoth's magic, Zhaitan's magic and Kralk's magic) feels... too easy? Too convientiant? Not sure how to phrase it. Mitigating problems is cool, but solving them so swiftly just doesn't feel right.
---
I feel it's worth nothing to folks who might be trying to farm Quartz: if you're in a clearly organized Dry Top map, please try and be courteous! You can mine the Rich Quartz Crystal node *without* aggroing the Skritt Queen. **Hug the left wall** of the cave to avoid aggroing her or her minions. Do the same when leaving.
---
Skritt Queen is normally done last or second-to-last in organized Dry Top maps because of the timing of other events during sandstorm. This keeps you from a possible case of deadness (her minions hurt), and allows the many people in the organized zerg their Skritt Queen event for more Geodes. :)
---
I think they only spawn when you are first clearing the brandstorms, and when camps are established and you are guiding a supply run. That's how I've gotten them at least.
---
Honestly Beta?
---
 The collection is like 80% of the patch.  This episode has 18 achievements.  I'm not an AP hunter and I have 10/18 after a day?  The last few episodes have had 30 or more. 
---
If you're not working on the collection then all there really is is a new, short story episode and a mini Dragon Stand meta.  The map is gorgeous, but if you're not doing the sky scale collection or mount then it's remarkably empty. 
---
There's zero new lore in the UW, FoW or Melandru zones.  They're just tourist attraction... =/
---
Yeah i'm just studying medical now. Away from gw2.
---
n_n People don't seem to understand the problem rn while saying the same dialogue over and over " you just want the mount now "
---
That gets very very annoying. Finish the achievement and get the skyscale.
---
Hope you understand what I mean then.
---
If you still don't. The skyscale was made for you. Enjoy flying :D
---
Just cus you have after years of gameplay doesn't mean everyone does.
---
so, I'm guessing you're also missing a ton of ascended gear, and have almost no Laurel-only items?
---
Look, I know it's the hip thing to just complain about timegating stuff now that it's a hot topic, but this is far from the only thing that is timegated in the game. Stuff like crafting ascended gear has always been timegated as well, but I haven't seen people complain wildly before that they're stuck to Exotics or anything because they can only play one day a week
---
I used to make charged quartz daily because of the ley line tools. 
---
I quit when their value dropped .. why oh why
---
Let me know if you want a key for PoF, I have a few extras.
---
I KNEW I WAS SAVING CHARGED QUARTZ FOR SOMETHING!!!!   WOOOOOO!!!!
---
Celestial gear?  Who even needs it anyway?!  Hahahahaha!!!!  Yeah!!!
---
There is quite few. Would not say that it is skin fatigue, yet, but it clearly that Anet loves crystal theme just like buttcapes.

To give you a stronger feeling of pride and accomplishment.
---
Mick Jaggar has sang about this exact scenario in every Stones concert since 1969.  The important part goes like this; 
---
&gt; You can't always get what you want
---
But if you try sometimes you might find
---
You get what you need
---
You realize all of your angry frothing is based on two things: 
---
1) They marketed Aurora *slightly differently* than the Skyscale. They were both used to hype their respective episodes. 
---
2) The Skyscale technically offers *slightly different* functionality than other mounts...though, as far as I can tell, it hasn't fundamentally changed how we interact with the world like the other mounts did. It's no griffon, that's for sure. We won't really know until people unlock it and start using it in the rest of the game, though. 
---
Like, those are two *extremely fine* hairs to be splitting to justify this pants-shitting you're pulling right now.
---
I’m away from the PC for a few more days, but I’m always super disappointed that we get the mount AFTER we’ve finished the story/content/zone. I’d prefer to unlock it within the first 25% of the content so we can explore a new zone/progress with the new mount.
---
Maybe check ur graphic setting, you should see aoes coming and can dodge them with some practice
---
Yes. As soon as I got the griffon I never went back to vabbi. As soon as I got the beetle I never went back to kourna.
---
ANet does what it does, meanwhile rando asshats on subreddit are just throwing shit and trying to riot this time, feeling safe after some eventful situation quite long time ago. Ah, yes. Classic.
---
Preach
---
This is exactly how I felt and feel.
---
I really don't give a kralkafuk about that, sry
---
Yeah, I expected it to be more like Caithe's armour - calling the shiny version "Blossoming" with zero crystal blossoms in sight? It makes me sad.
---
I'll use the best of both and call it the Timegate
---
Not sure about that. You can only craft 1 lamp a day meaning sources are limited from players looking to profit.
---
I like the recording of Taimi (that someone else posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bp3tby/found_this_little_gem_from_the_episode_glad/) ) even more, I suppose she calms down by the time you get to join her on the airship x)
---
Fun fact about the "Mysterious Asura" / Phlunt: His get up is identical to Kudu's, except for the glow of his arm gadget (Kudu's is red, Phlunt's is black). What's interesting about this is that for Kuda (and this "Inquest Phlunt") is that the arm gadget is on the opposite side than T3 light cultural armor players can get. Snaff even wears both Zojja's and Kudu's arm gadgets on his version of T3 light cultural armor. I wonder if he would have also taken Kuda's place, given that similarity in armor.
---
Where this sigil enter on this achiev? (noob question)
---
What's confusing you?
---
Yea, and i still don't know why they nerfed the elite specs
---
They were fine. 
---
I had them unlocked before they were nerfed and never understood the lazyness of the people who complained.
---
If they'd spent half the time playing the game instead of complaining the original elite specs would've never been a problem
---
I resonate with the limited play time. I can really only dedicate about an hour a day, with only one day a week I can sit down for 4. During my 1 hour, I like to run fractals and getting my crafting up for ascended stuff. This mount is something I will probably never get =/
---
I'm right here too. I installed gw2 again, was hyped to jump in and see the new story and mount, saw this time gate for the mount, and went nah not worth it. I didn't feel like starting up again just to do homework.
---
I think I'd feel different if there was some alternative bonus to doing it, but it seems pointless outside of the mount. Shame.
---
That’s a nice condescension you’re doing there, but people have legitimate grievances about how the information regarding the release of the Skyscale was handled, as well as the lack of agency that the players have in competing the collection. 
---
If you want to take your time and smell the roses, that’s fine. But some people either don’t have time to play the game at their leisure several times a week, or simply want to complete the content that has been released. Posting a haughty thread to belittle people without actually contributing anything to the discussion is some real bullshit.
---
Esp. on a subreddit already populated by people who play the game.
---
&gt; if there are any
---
:(
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
---
I see a ton of people getting down-voted for saying that they won't bother with it. Seems like a pretty unpopular opinion on reddit at least.
---
Triggered much? I wasn't "bitching". I've actually defended the collection in other topics. Your analogy just isn't very convincing to someone that's salty about skyscale requirements.
---
All you really need is the wiki to give you a quick rundown of the classes, there's also plenty of decent videos out there. Personally, I'd say do this:  
---
Make a character and get to level 3. When you do that, go into the PvP zone - all abilities and traits and specializations are unlocked there. look through and test everything, see if the class interests you. thats what i did.
---
Mesmer / Holo / guardian
---
&gt; ’d prefer to unlock it within the first 25% of the content so we can explore a new zone/progress with the new mount
---
For this very reason, they've put the "Borrow Skyscale" points all over the new map, though.
---
The biggest thing is mastery points, which is the biggest character progression thing for max level. Mastery points only come from achievements, and you can spend mastery points on things like [more loot from fractals](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Recursive_Resourcing), [instant autoloot all the time](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Advanced_Logistics), [the ability to use a glider](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glider_Basics) and [the ability to ride your jackal through special portals.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shifting_Sands). There's also plenty of unique items you get as rewards, like an ascended weapon that you can pay a small fee to morph between shield/scepter/greatsword/sword/dagger. Or a legendary backpack, or tons of cool transmogs.
---
Lots of achievements are simple stuff like "complete this story instance" and stuff like that too, so even without specifically hunting them down, you'll get some.
---
The time it takes to liquidate them though I am better of doing other content that is more lucrative and fun.
---
I'd enjoy that. A r/gw2shitpost or whatever would be a decent change of pace lmao.
---
/u/that_shaman : Sorry for asking but can your magic tells us more about the other (locked) collections so we can prepare ourselves?
---
Thanks
---
or you could have gotten them free if you had done the first step of each when they released (just like this one)
---
As f2p you have access to all the base game's story, maps and professions up to max lvl. I can't think of another MMO that's so generous to f2p players. The main restrictions are to prevent spam and economic manipulation, that's why map chat, whispers and trading post are restricted.
---
I did the promotion and never got it XD
---
What else is required to make the food? I'm 24 hours behind and trying to stay ahead.
---
I don't care if Anet adds 5000 timegated bullshit collections and a bunch of other dumb shit, all I care about in this game is Taimi being alive and happy. 
---
(I mean I'd still *prefer* if we dropped the bullshit timegating nonsense...)
---
Can be anything from titles to skins to points for even more skins, legendary items through collections
---
She was born of three types of magic (6 I guess since the dragons all have two aspects?) so she likely developed to be able to adapt to contain essentially any type of magic.
---
/This comment was made by the Charged Quartz Gang/
---
Does it cost any silver to use the teleports themselves?
---
Nice straw man. People who can play a decent time daily will unlock the mount soon enough while those who can have one binge session during the weekend are the ones who are affected the most. I wouldn't call those hardcore players.
---
Not this achievement, Sigil of Nullification is for Requiem armor achievements from A Star to Guide Us (LS4 episode 4).
---
&gt; GW2 is NOT f2p friendly, not in the slightest.
---
I played 10 months as f2p and had a lot of fun. Imho the game is really generous to free players (especially compared to other games). You get access to *all* of the base game's story, maps and professions up to max lvl for the price tag of 0.
---
Sure. And new players could also have them, if they just weren't new players. They should have just bought the game before chapter 6 so they could login. I don't see your point.
---
I should really play it at some point. Thanks!
---
I just got a friend into the game this past week, he's working towards lvl 80 now and is very excited about getting the mounts - I haven't had the heart yet to tell him the latest one requires a ton of gold and timegated steps, let alone that he'll have to get the other living story episodes when he was hesitant enough about buying the expansions. Really hope Anet rethinks this thing.
---
Griffon is super smooth if you know how to use it
---
*Skyscale lives with you into its twenties and refuses to get a job*
---
Timegateception
---
How?  You can full clear in a day or 7.  If I only play on Saturdays and get my full clear in (or at least Wings 1-4) I still get my weekly 15 LI.  It will take me 10 weeks to get 150 LI only playing on Saturday.
---
Two fairly stupid questions
---
First; where the hell can I find the dps benchmark golems?
---
Second; what is a feasible way to unlock -all- low-mid-highbut not ascended crafting recipes? Kind of want to do that just to say I can/did. Just brute force or is there a decent guide out there?
---
I felt this literally the moment we found Aurene and she had those people caring for her egg. BIG TIME when I saw her brand Caith.
---
She's a dragon.
---
The world will never be safe unless every dragon is gone, Aurene is good now but will she always be? Will her descendants?
---
besides craft gen 1 legendaries? :P
---
&gt; It keeps you coming back to the map for weeks.
---
Whilst technically true, it doesn't tell the whole story. From behaviour I've witnessed, and heck done myself, collections push players to be very objective driven. If they need a specific event, they either wait at the spot it starts, or go off to do another part of the collection. So whilst yes, it brings players to the map, they aren't really doing the map's content. They're waiting for the one thing they need before they leave.
---
&gt; It keeps the map populated for players who can't be there on release, or who can only play every so often. 
---
I would argue this issue is better fixed by making more fun and rewarding maps. Look at HoT maps, look at Silverwastes, these maps are engaging, rewarding and players enjoy doing them - they are constantly active as a result. The new map will likely follow suit because it has a repeatable meta that's pretty fun. 
---
Anet forcing players to go back to maps is just a bandaid, it doesn't really help anyone because they'll just leave again. Why would I go do Desolation events. There's nothing there, and it's uninteresting. A collection may force me to do so, but once done I'm not going back till the next collection says I need to do it.
---
&gt; You know what happens when they don't do that? Kourna.
---
I think you massively overstate the effect this had on Kourna's population. The map lacks a good meta event, it also lacks long term rewards such as weapon sets and armour skins. It's also just an empty map for the most part. There are far too many other variables leading to that maps decline to pin so much blame on the lack of a timegate on the Roller Beetle. Personally, I found nothing enjoyable with that map so left it as soon as possible. 
---
Ultimately, the issues of maps being empty are down to the lack of content. The solution to this is to put content into maps, instead of timegating.
---
Wait i can buy the food and the lamp to bypass the 12-22 day timegate?
---
If so, thank you lord
---
&gt; This is going to look great in Excel.
---
Modern game industry in a nutshell.
---
thanks for taking the time to make this guide.
---
Yo lemme know if there is a current MMO that has no timegating whatsoever, I'd hit that.
---
Do you have the unlock the food recipe or can you make it early?
---
I think it requires you to kill a champion in Istan
---
I think this is the LS4 equivalent of Aurora.  Instead of a legendary shiny with annoying effects we get a helicopter.
---
I think it is great, when looked at like that. The capstone on the season should tie into the season.
---
Wow, I don't play that often and was thinking of getting on to play around with a skyscale but I think I'll stay not playing that often.  That just sounds terrible.
---
fusion .... anybody?!
---
What's the name of the food on the TP?
---
Low effort and value post.
---
still it's a huge cost in gems and i mean huge. it's  200 gems for a single episode
---
Other than the 12 attunements shown in the collection, there's many other kinds of magic and magical attunements mentioned through both games: Chaos, Light, Holy, Darkness, Shadow, Arcane, Strength, Mind, Creation, Destruction, Existence, Domination, Inspiration, Illusions, Channeling, Restoration, Deeps, Lies, Secrets, Nightmares, Time, Space, Celestial, Leyline, Dragon, Demonic, Godly... 
---
It's like the light spectrum. If you mix red and green, you get yellow. Mix red and blue, you get cyan. Mix red and blue, you get magenta.  
---
There's no 'basic' colors. We see red, green and blue as basic colors because out eyes have receptors for red, green and blue, but it's all different spectrums that come together.  
---
So all these types of magics will be separate types of magics of their own, but you can still get them by mixing or distilling other types of magic.
---
"Growth" is often found as part of other magics rather than on its own. But it's often seen with magic related to plants. Sylvari use plant manipulation magics that control their growth to shape them.
---
There's a few instances of "Growth" appearing on its own. In Metrica province there's an event in which we fight an overgrown asura, and another in which a baby raptor grows too big very fast. Ogres know of tonics that they can use to make their pets and themselves grow bigger. 
---
For example, it could be something like this:
---
* Want nature magic? Mix water, earth, life and growth magic. Boom. Nature magic.
---
* Want lightning magic? Get a lot of air magic, add a spark of fire magic. Zap. Lightning.
---
* Want plasma? Grab the lightning you made before, put extra fire, and it gets you plasma.
---
* Want Strengthening magic? Mix Blood and Courage.
---
* Want to go on a Rampage? Mix Strength and a bit of Growth.
---
* Want to steal life from enemies? Mix Blood and Life, and you get Life Steal.
---
* Want Life Force? Mix Life and Death, and you can turn deaths into Life Force.
---
* Want to make necromancer minions? Find some corpses, put in them a lot of Death magic, a bit of Spirit to give them some behavior, a and quite some Life Force, and you probably get minions.
---
* Want to make sand shades? Add Earth magic to Life Force, and you can create Sand Shades that can hurt enemies and defend allies.
---
* Want to make a Tar elemental? A bit of Death magic  and darkness magic on Earth magic will probably do the trick.
---
* Want Crystal magic? Start with a base of earth, add lightning to make it glassy, add growth. Crystals come out.
---
* Want pure 'elemental' magic? Mix all four basic elements: Black, wind, fire and steel... I mean, Fire, Water, Air, Earth.
---
What's Aurora?
---
I think they didnt torment aurene because of her ascension (which glint worked on with her) as well her being at peace/benevolent while kralk was primarily focused on destruction/hunger.
---
that's the point. if i'd knew from the begininng i'd skip the new mount farming as a whole
---
Well it'll be back next year so not available in a while :0
---
If it we're me I'd go with a boosted character; have the opportunity to fully flex your build as you get reaquainted with the game and not be forced to do a heart to get enough xp for the next map (without hopping to a different start city that is, always an option)
---
Aurora was a legendary, that's a different thing.
---
All of you are missing the point.  If a collection is not timegated, let's say, and takes 14 hours to grind out and you play 2 hours per day every day then you can finish it in 1 week.  Now, let's say I have a full time job and can't play except on weekends but I can play 7 hours on Saturday and Sunday.  Well, now I can do the collection in 2 days because I put in more time but it still took 14 hours.
---
Now, add a time gate every 2 hours.  The first person will still complete it in 1 week but the second person now needs to take a month just because of a dumb time gate.
---
If 2 people grind a collection for 14 hours it shouldn't matter if they did it in a day or 5.  Time gates hard restrict you from playing how you want.  You become a slave to how the game, or Arena Net wants you play.  It's terrible design.
---
Newer players got all chapters for free since they were consecutively free for a week as buildup for the finale.
---
If you are newer than that then yeah, you are fucked I guess.
---
Oh my god 4 days and 140g to be lazy? 
---
THIS IS THE WORST I WANT WHAT I DIDNT EVEN PAY FOR GEEEEEEEEEWEWWWEEEWWQASWWEEEEEEEEZ
---
Y’all are babies. This collection is for a flying mount. It’s not supposed to be easy. You’re okay with a month for slight QoL in legendary armor, but 4 days and ~100g is too much? Lol.
---
That is the worst comparison I've read in the past two months.
---
It's stated even on the locked achievements description.
---
*FMA backflashes*
---
WoW has had more "total" endgame content, but GW2 as waaaay more relevant endgame content. Because in GW2 you're not chasing an imaginary carrot on a stick item level. In GW2 the same gear I had 5 years ago is still Best in Slot today. You can still progress gear in the form of getting full sets of different stats to run different builds on other characters.
---
What this causes is that all content is just as hard and nearly always relevant. Sure you can use the argument that some content isn't worth it, but you still gain rewards 
---
I'll give an example using WoW terms. Imagine you're playing a Paladin and you want to play Ret, you get gear with Attack Power, Crit Chance, and Crit Damage. You easily get Blue (WoW Blue gear) and then you take the time to craft your Epic gear. But now you want to play Holy, so now you farm Power for gear with Power, Healing, and buff duration. Now you want to run a Fire DPS build that focuses on Damage over time on your Ret Paladin, so now you want to farm of a set of gear with Power, Critical Chance, Damage over time damage, and damage over time duration stats. There's lots more different stat combinations for lots of different builds and game modes.
---
So even though there is no item level progression, there is still a "grind" for those that want it. The good thing about this game is that EVERYTHING you do contributes to your wealth and gear progression. EVERYTHING. Imagine playing WoW and every single little activity you did benefit you.
---
Yeah, good luck trying to sell me skins of a mount that I will never have
---
Any chance of making this work with the Radial mount addon?
---
Spirit Shards mostly. If I am still getting them, then great, but I haven’t noticed that I am getting any.
---
im pretty certain season 4 is on sale for 800 gems. 800 gems isnt much to pay tbh
---
the chapters were free on arrival and were also free the previous weeks to the finale's release.
---
They only cost you if you weren't there or chose not to redeem them for free a few weeks ago.
---
So yeah, this isn't a charity even if they give free shit away sometimes.
---
Don't get me wrong it's not the existence of a time gate that bothers me. I'd do it if it was worth the effort. But a mediocre mount locked behind a huge mountain of time gates and collections on par with a legendary weapon? Not worth it.
---
FY NCSoft
---
Taking our good devs away
---
Not having played the patch yet (busy in life) seeing this map confuses me so much, im guessing its in the mists cus i cant place it anywhere on tyria
---
This is 100% false.  If I want to grind 20 hours to finish the collection I should be able to.  If I want to do 1 hour of the collection for 20 days I should be able to.  You should be able to play games how YOU want to play them, NOT be forced to play them on a schedule dictated by the developer.  That's bad design.  It's a common predatory practice used by mobile games to get money out of players.  You time gate things but allow the player to pay $$ to bypass the time gate.  Defending the time gates is like saying "yes, keep exploiting gamers I am OK with it"
---
Bubbles concept work was very lovecraftian
---
I wouldn't even be fazed at this point lol
---
Ed...ward
---
I wouldn't mind the timegate as much if the skyscale was actually legendary true full flight or even semi full flight, but its not even that good.  A griffon, a springer and a leap of faith accomplish everything the skyscale can and far, FAR more. 
---
The new map is designed to play to the skyscale's strength and play to all the other mount's weaknesses (Lots of branches to hinder griffon pullups, ledges that are just outside springer's reach, vertical ledges stacked directly ontop of one another meaning that despite springer being able to jump that high, he can't access them because he bumps his head, ect ect), but ouside dragonfall, there aren't even that many areas it can shine on.
---
It needs to have its flight time doubled if not tripled (alongside its speed) to be even remotely worth it.
---
Yeah it will make some other mounts slightly obsolete, but considering that its behind a NINE DAY timegate at absolute MINIMUM (and that's only so far) assuming you blaze through everything, and requires ALL of season 4 and sends you on a tyria wide scavenger hunt, while costing 140g in charged quartz alone then you might as well actually make it worth it.
---
Ten times is an understatement my friend. 
---
I completed griffin in a few hours of solid play. This is that times at least 30 by now, not including the time gating. 
---
And it’s possible for it to get worse.
---
You as a player might not have done it but your commander has.
---
Besides if you never did core/hot you definatly should, your missing out on so much.
---
Provisioner tokens
---
&gt; Grow Lamp will only go down in price because actually you can craft it for 15 gold, the only limitation is the charged cristal which is not worth 50 more gold.
---
You can only craft 1 grow lamp a day. That's gonna be a pretty big hinderance considering in 9 hours half the playerbase who missed the first reset will be looking for one.
---
So under 2 hours?
---
*Mother*
---
under one hour
---
LMAO i suck at photoshop + im at work so i cant edit photos but you get the pic XD
---
Wait, what  seriously?
---
Why is it so short?
---
You can make fortune selling food and lamps. Tommorow the price is gonna skyrocket.
---
The **news station**, yes. Where do they get their weather resorts from? Most of the time it's offered to them for free by the localschool districts and government funded research centers.
---
Ya know I thought about that but I realize so many people have such large amounts stockpiled they will just flood the TP anyways, and just checking the NA TP rn it's already starting! Prices are going down at a good rate 7g food down to 4g
---
A guildie of mine had the same issue. He used a scroll to enter tho. When he left and walked in trough the portal gorrik was there
---
Because it is just the unfnishied end of the last episode
---
Lod distance, model limit and so on. You should run everything on middle at least (except textures and shaders) there is a helpful little check box you should make sure to check, something about limit effect LOD (currently not at home, otherwise I could tell how it's named correctly)
---
Maybe I can post a Screenshot later. Only thing to look out for, is to pick the settings according to your pc specs
---
I don't think they care as much as your meme implies tho...
---
This isn’t content. It’s a time gated scavenger hunt. There is a huge difference.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Yeah, but demand hasn't arrived yet. Most people are still stuck on step 2. Tommorow when most people enter step 3 that's when the majority of people will start buying.
---
In my mind, those are all just different flavors of the same problem: uncontrolled magic on the rampage.  The Aurene arc started in Season 2 and the uncontrolled magic problem started coming to light early in season 3 and has been steadily getting worse since.  To me, it feels like a satisfying culmination and resolution to two long developed plot lines.  From a storytelling perspective, I think it will free up the writers to introduce some conflict that is completely different from the wild magic stuff, without needing to worry about tying it into the various elemental magics.  For instance, I'd like to see something like a war between some of the major nations, now that the overarching threat makes their cooperation via the Pact less urgent.  Or an invasion from/of Cantha.  Or some kind of Khan-ur rising from the distant parts of the Charr lands.  Or Phlunt and/or the inquest causing a conflict with the Sylvari or something.
---
How much is your new installation now?
---
I'm at 44GB atm.
---
This question is only available after the daily reset.
---
I agree that the time-gate to get the sky scale is quite excessive. However, none of the potential solutions you list sound like they’d be satisfying alternatives.
---
Giving is a free sky scale to use anywhere? Then what’s the point of putting effort towards finishing the collection? The masteries matter obviously, but unless the free version is significantly worse (in which case no one would want to use it anyway) then there’s little reason to actually do the collection.
---
And I love the dense jungle maps, I’m not sure what you think removing the canopy in Dragonfall would do, but Melandru’s Lost Domain is gorgeous as-is and I don’t think making the scales more obnoxious to reach is a good alternative to time-gating. I found that collection to be decently difficult the way it is.
---
I would make different changes. I’d prefer that the ingredients were something that doesn’t have a cooldown to craft, or doing more scavenger hunting or fighting something instead of waiting for a timer.
---
Lack of time isn't the problem, it's the time gates that don't let people utilize the time they do have
---
One of my most treasured memories is from the original release of the Labyrinthine Cliffs, before gliding or mounts. I would pop into the map and watch bodies fall from the sky. That's when I got the reviver achievement.
---
This however it's the laziest way possible of making people stick to the game, and guess what?  It's making people pissed, not interested.
---
Or actually use all that Story XP that went **fucking nowhere on the mount masteries!** Crazy idea, that, develop the mastery in the story and as you explore. Like we could with Raptor, Bun-Bun, and Skimmer. 
---
Fucking crazy idea that.
---
Cheers, that's crazy, I can't even believe it. Wtf Anet.
---
I got trolled by ANet.
---
I'm always saying that I take it as a personal affront when there's nothing behind every single waterfall.
---
The first thing I do in every map as soon as I see a waterfall was looking behind them. I did, and not a single one of these waterfalls had something behind them.  
---
But I had to look for them all because it was part of an achievement. 
---
Yeah, I got a recipe as a reward, but I still prefer hidden caves with treasure and interesting secret rooms with fun stuff inside.
---
So many waterfalls, so many wasted opportunities.
---
This was psychological torture!
---
1 word: No.
---
[Another angle.](https://i.imgur.com/9UlhuSV.jpg)
---
Well right on queue guys. Day 2 and we are bitching that everything isn't done, too  hard, too expensive.
---
Day 3 will be bitching that there is not enough to do .
---
I used [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bp1ubp/master_guide_on_my_beautiful_infrastructure/) post, and it helps. At reset if you rush and go in order on the posts image, you'll...maybe get them all.
---
I then waited at #1 for it to reset, and then went in order and the events popped one after each other. 
---
It's very very clear from all the other achievements that they wanted us to spend a number of days on this map. Have you seen the requirement for the kill achievement? It's 1000, each. Throw 100 Embers at enemies. (Although this one is easy-ish on crystal break meta step). Trigger 50 Soul Binders.
---
Someone at ArenaNet saw the complaints of "It's too short", and took to fixing that very literally.
---
Same, I was working towards some Celestial Armor for my WvW Weaver (it's a gimmick build for the sake of psuedo-supporting my bf, please don't come for me about how Celestial isn't meta because I've heard it 100 times before), so I was getting these daily too. I'm very glad I was.
---
Second question: 
---
&gt; Why are you adding "do it 10 times but only 3 times per day" mobile game garbage?
---
It's good and entertaining. But it's just 2 story instances and a couple of open workd missions
---
He has a map icon. The map icon will appear on the edge of the minimap when you are not close enough for it to appear inside. Look carefully at the minimap.
---
Personally, I don't have a problem with time-gates...I have a problem with BUGGED EVENTS required for completion.
---
In all honesty, the time gates kind of killed my motivation to even do the collection, but I know I'll do it anyway, eventually. It's just a needless and annoying tactic to keep players in the map, when I feel like the map should do that on its own merits.
---
thats strange. my GF got an email, where they said you have to accept all 3 to get it. thats why i changed my preferences for emails from gw2 only to all 3
---
WoW is over [that way dude.](https://reddit.com/r/worldofwarcraft/) Maybe you'd be more at home over there. 
---
This is for GW2, the casual game for people with lives and families.
---
Dude even the same horns. Face is a little different.
---
OFC there are tons of peeps who are playing the game daily and have stockpiles of those crystals. Combined with the fact that every account who wants the scyscale only need a couple of those recipes. It will be the same like mauldrey so many years ago. Ppls freaked out about it, ppl payed massive amounts for it an nowadays you get it basically for free. Since the last summer event quartz crystals are not even expensive anymore. So the price of those "nasty" timegated materials will plummit in the next few days.
---
I mean, this is not abnormal. Any kind of narrative works sees changes and cuts like this. Hell, my D&amp;D setting is 12 years old and I’ve made huge sweeping changes and cuts overtime to better reflect what I want the world to be.
---
I know these, but tbh im not a fan of many variety of these, plus some are gemstore exclusive.
---
I think the new armor might be the one that i trully *like* from the crystal theme
---
When looking at this collection, with there being hints for the location of all items, I really thought I could take my time and enjoy finding them. But instead, the time gate just motivated me to look them all up so I don't end up locked behind the wait. It's really unfortunate, because I really believe I would have enjoyed the collections if not for the time gates they've put on it. 
---
Now it's 4 days of stressful unfun following guides to complete the collection instead of having fun exploring the map and trying to get the hints. This of course won't be the case for everyone, but it certainly ruined the collection for me, one of potentially few players who would have otherwise enjoyed it.
---
Yep. I got to sell one last night at 90g, but I expect the one I'll sell after reset will be under 40 or 50.
---
Wait a moment...I see everyone complaining about the skyscale.OK.PLEASE NOTE THAT IT'S SIMILIAR OR BETTER THAN GRIFFON IN SOME WAYS AND GRIFFON TAKES 250G AND LIKE 3 HOURS TO GET AND THEN THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN ?
---
If they really wanted to have people helping in open world, they should have limited this to downed allies, not defeated, and while in combat only, so people go instead to events that down a lot of players, like Taidha, the Golem MKII and Tequatl.
---
They didn't, so jump off a cliff it is.
---
Do you have to kill Zaithan and Mordremoth on the account you do the skyscale quest?
---
Might want to pick up a case. Maybe sell tickets at home to your friends.
---
Pretty much, I'm losing desire to even visit this sub for the next month as that's all it's become. I almost feel mentally time-gated from visiting this sub until it's calmed down. #relevant
---
what's RES? XD
---
I’m having a hard time following the logic of turning the whole map into a fractal.
---
*What, you guys don't own swords?*
---
I think it is part, "you have to work for this," part "they still have some work to do." 
---
Rather then delay everything even longer, they released what they could. This mount is going to require some things in Core being adjusted (JP's, etc.) and it takes time. It is just speculation on my part, though.
---
I had some sort of bug when attempting to unlock the beetle (lol) and it was still more enjoyable than the skyscale!
---
 Hell I had more fun waiting for the glitch with A bug in the system to be patched *(was that the one where we couldn't get through the portal for days?)* Users gathering around and doing the griffon 'wave' outside of the instance was an absolute blast.
---
Well.  Guess I better get started
---
Yeah that stuff was dope.
---
["hidden grove"](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/~/media/A2C12EA0A1BE49C9A34D1C50C184DB0D.ashx?w=274)
---
You was able to get exp in hot maps when forsaken thicket mastery line was locked. However now I am not getting any exp at all even skyscale mastery line is locked
---
make the food, same profit wise but you can make all at once and sell all at once, lamp just once a day.
---
just made 250 gold from 50 food
---
Just the first collection is 21 items from all over the map, in some of the most difficult places to get to...
---
... and you shouldn't need a Dulfy guide open on your laptop to find these fucking things.
---
It’s really surprising to me that they planned a story spoiler chat the week of release but a chat about the new mount goes to the end of the month. Except that they knew we probably wouldn’t have our hands on it until the 24th. I’m not even all that mad about the time gate, except all the experience I’m missing out on while I complete 30 events in the map and all the other shenanigans for my beloved scale baby.
---
I was playing a different game. I came back for the story and mount. Won't be getting the mount. Will be going back to the other game. I was hoping the mount was worth getting but it's not to me. I don't care for how it handles or it's skills so I will not be going through the effort. ANet's loss.
---
There were some hints at Phlunt being a bad guy in season 3. On my first playthrough I was pretty sure he was involved in the Lazarus thing especially at the start of episode 5... Well that was until the Balthazar reveal ofc \^\^
---
I don’t disagree, but I’m not sure I’m super enthused with the armor. The male variants are fine but wtf is up with some of the female only elements? The random leg slits that look really out of place, or the weird neck thing for the medium armor for example. I’m not sure I really want to incorporate any of these armor pieces into my character designs.
---
Time gates are always going to do more harm than good (at least in my opinion) if there's not some way to get around them that doesn't require money. At least in GW2. I can't be bothered to craft Legendaries because of time-gated crafting stuff, even if I really want a couple of them. Same with Mawdry. Why go after these things when it becomes a chore?
---
That being said... other than the charged crystal and the food in general, it doesn't seem that bad yet. Have to see what the other collections try.
---
What would make 'timegating' better:
---
* Quartz Crystal - Higher quartz requirement, but each point of power can be used once a day (or even each map has two possible each day)
---
* Skyscale Feeding - Let us race them around Dragonfall and get them hungry again. Or even train them to fight a bit (and give us exp tokens we can use for mastery when they unlock) by having them be like Aurene or NPC allies.
---
Mawdry's a plant, so I can accept the time gating as growing it. Granted, time magic does exist with Chronomancer, but not sure anyone in Tyria is exactly experimenting with chronomancy and plant growing. Maybe some quests in the Sylvari area that'd help speed it up?
---
When does the achievement give credit? Right as you get 10 or after you complete the full instance including Dragonfall? I thought for sure I broke 10 but didn't get credit after the flight section on multiple runs. On reset runs where I log out to restart, the achievement progress disappears once we get to the final god realm and if I cut the wing I can't restart on that part any more.
---
I'm speaking about the farming
---
Yes. It's one of the two tonics you can buy in Dragonfall. The other one is a Shadow Warrior.
---
Legendary trinket. It is one of the hardest collections/achievements in game. I am like halfway through it....slowly working on it every so often.
---
I had troubled getting the beetle in Silverwastes to spawn. When it finally did I pinged my guilds (several guilds) and stated flatly "beetle for Roller Beetle collection spawned after 30 minutes of waiting. If you need it, come now."
---
Had about ten others show up, we killed it, and continued on our day. And standing still for 30 minutes was fine because I got the beetle that same day! But running around the new map for 2 hours made me a little sick of it. Like I should not need a break from the NEW MAP.
---
Agree, a lot of female armor is fashion over function and GW2 is extremely hit or miss with it :s
---
You get one Question per Day
---
Time gated stuff in an mmo like gw2 is just lazy and stupid design
---
Ignore it.
---
Anet was perfect with the skyscale and gave exactly what the community wanted.
---
From what I can see from here people wanted chores exactly like this and do not mind it.
---
Will downvote you if you say otherwise.
---
This community is good for people who like content like this. Play the game for what you like and pick up something else like I will ._.
---
If you arguments need to be made on this stuff on whether this stuff is fun or not then there's clearly a problem.
---
Avoid a headache and let Anet never change this so people can feel good about themselves.
---
:D I don't have time for this. Most adults don't. Paying to do chores ain't my thing but there's a community that likes it. This community seems like that one. Let them be happy.
---
Seriously ._. They have something to work towards.
---
I'm just glad the mount isn't that great so I'm not feeling pushed to get it to replace my Griffon.
---
&gt; If you can point me to someone here complaining about the timegating that's hurting for spirit shards, I'll concede your point.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpcruo/episode_6_guild_chat_this_friday_we_want_your/enrx79a/
---
I don't understand why this needs to be said. It's not like a checklist of mundane activities is in any way comparable to new events, a new map or a new instance
---
Reddit Enhancement Suite - for desktop browsers. Does stuff like adding a clickable hide/show embed button for images.
---
Any chance you read post fully?
---
So your problem doesn't even reach a discussion of whether it's timegated or not, because the mount itself is your problem. As such, the short answer to my question is "it doesn't make any difference at all."
---
Right?
---
I hope you get it soon, but at least it's accessible yo you, for me getting a flying mount is equivalent of paying money, regard less which one is choose to get.
---
Still an aditional 4 day timegate, still not fun.
---
Based on your definition farming sw is an exploit? I'm sure dev didn't intend for its players to spend all game time on one map.
---
I had way more, but I had been crafting ley infused tools for my guild hall.
---
I'm left with 200 or so now. &gt;_&lt;
---
so around 30 tasks, some fractals, world bosses, random events, all that?
---
It's not really about "farming". You have to go collect shit.
---
I wouldn't be quite this pissed off if the stuff you collect was dropped from mobs, but no... Can't have anything like that. It might actually be fun.
---
Grow lamps
---
but we can now afk midair bois!
---
ANet still bans for that.
---
Or they did exactly once, anyway.
---
The first Wintersday introduced a recipe that re-balanced ecto, but apparently they didn't mean to.
---
Rare and exotic trinkets that took 0 ecto to craft, but could return the usual 0-3 ecto, with a chance of getting a major crafting component back from salvage.
---
It raised the prices of mithril and ori, and dropped ecto to about 20 silver.
---
People were asking on the official forums if the mechanic was intended for more than a week, getting no response.
---
Then after about two weeks from the Wintersday patch, ANet handed out something like 1500 permabans based on former developer and ANet economist John Smith's...uh...claim that people were more-or-less duplicating ecto.
---
The early trading post was much more unstable than it is now, so everybody was willing to blame "the ecto-duping cheaters," praise John Smith, and forget about it.
---
Mind you, this was after the Godskull exploit, and the Charr Cultural Weapon exploit (which had EXPLICIT warnings, up to and including official GMs standing in front of the still-active vendor telling people they would be banned if they purchased things at the glitched price).
---
Only one of the two exploits I just noted got bans; the one with the clear verbal warnings and official statements.  And that one was changed to a temp ban.  The Wintersday Snowflake Trinket ban was never lifted, and everyone forgot about it, despite how overreaching it was.
---
ANet is well-known as 'Consistantly inconsistent,' and it's been that way for a while.
---
My time is NOT cheap. Gold is.
---
I mean as people progress in their collection they'll need it too, so the price might stay up for a little while.
---
&gt;they are useless
---
no they aren't, you won't lose the progress but whatever you did up to that point is "saved".
---
Jesus, almost a year to unlock the Skyscale pretty much.
---
F.
---
They show little icons on the map where to find and place the eggs. it's a VERY VERY tiny icon
---
They still can't give us proper shirts and shorts for medium armor.
---
If you ever find yourself in a position where you need some gold, consider doing daily fractals!
---
You don't have to kill anything. I have been doing it with a character that didn't do any of that when the original crashed and I could not log in with him. 
---
There's no checks on actual character progress. You just have to go o a certain spot and use a mote, and the character does the /talk emote for a bit. The collection is already considering the commander did all of that, even if your character didn't.
---
I can't say I'm a fan of the time gates or the collections in collections, but I'm not about to quit over it. That seems a little extreme.
---
Interesting.
---
I heard you needed to craft 20 eternities before your game could render skyscales to begin with.
---
Sounds like you didn't play before, and you've decided you're not playing now so net loss of zero? You can buy the stuff that requires charged quartz crystals off the TP if you haven't been stockpiling. Are you talking about the feeding? Eh. I wanted to get it ASAP too but nine days isn't terrible honestly.
---
They really don't want us to get the new mount they made, don't they?
---
200 gems is not even close to a huge amount lmao.
---
I play on a fresh acc and know the storys. So I didn't play them again. Thats why I asked. Idk if you need them or not.
---
We did play before but we took a break. All 3 of us have 1K+ hours but we took a break because we werent massive fans of LW 3/4/5.
---
What a fresh and unique post, I've never seen anything like it.
---
I haven't tested it of course, but I don't think you need to have killed mordy. I suspect that's why they put the interaction location in the silverwastes, so you can do it without HoT.
---
Well imagine you go a Nightclub and it advertises free drinks. You walk up, the bouncer gives you the free drink and then punches you in the jaw. Thats about how it feels.
---
Good for getting those achievements too
---
&gt; If you kill a character, you don't bring it back to life right after. [...]. It completely ruined the dramatic climax of Episode 5
---
So you're calling bad writing on what is precisely not bad writing. The whole thing was planned long before. Most players thought about this option when they saw the end of EP5. Just because YOU wanted her death to be permanent despite the clues doesn't mean that it's bad writing to unfold the story in a different way.
---
These timegates are a godsend. If it wasn't for them, we'd be stuck on that instead having free time to do other stuff in the meantime.
---
I'm taking a break as well. Loved the episode. I'll do the sky scale at another time.
---
right because their line of thought is "level 80? mustve finished everything." only "hard" thing about this collection is having the time gate
---
Yeah I did miss that part.
---
Well here's the thing, your collection is stalled there, for Fort Trinity, you can basically just head there in the open map, nothing is locked in instances, so you are free to go on those. For Zhaitan and Mordremoth, the place you are going are often after the events so you are good to go too. But you need the collection unlocked to progress.
---
Hm weird cause that person said he could not interact with the symbol and he did never play the main story with his acc.
---
But...GW2 isn't making you spend any kind of money, and they aren't offering you methods in the gem store to bypass it. 
---
There isn't even a subscription that you need to pay to continue playing every day.
---
We all have at least 1 Legendary. We did Fractals alot pre-christmas and we ran HoT content alot. (Less so for PoF, we were less of a fan) but coming back to this find of slap is ridiculous.
---
Asuran warrior with a greatsword
---
Not really...
---
If only more entitled people that don't actually want to play the game would leave, I'm sure the rest of us would enjoy it even more! This seems like a low effort post making it seem like "Oh Anet not giving me the stuff I want right away is a bad business decision because WE WERE GONNA BUY GEMS". Just fuck off already.
---
Sure /shrug  
---
Each to their own.
---
Anything that can take you down in one hit will have visual tells to warn you. Usually orange marks on the floor with different shapes, but there's also tells on enemies, like they raising their arm and keeping it in the air a bit longer than usual before hitting.
---
Herald already has permanent 10-target Protection, Swiftness, Might, Fury, and Regen.
---
They don't need any more boons, they are already overpowered as hell in that regard.
---
I'm not sure I follow the logic trail of "if Player A leaves, Player B has a better time" but sure, you do you.
---
Great way to look at it. I also feel like it's meant to be a bit of a celebration of S4 as a whole, just like the map bringing back old mechanics felt like a celebration of all the maps before.
---
i am having the same problem
---
hopefully we can get a fix soon
---
Oh boy.
---
I still haven't even started the collection yet.
---
Wait, i didn't know you need the Skyscale to enjoy the game.
---
Maybe it's me doing something wrong...
---
Note that it can take up to 6 Weeks after April 29th (So we are basically only 2 weeks-in (4 more to go)). (For reasons that goes over my head)
---
I don’t play pve enough to need the mount so that’s a no for me dog
---
Curious how much money you actually spent on the game? Cause mostly those people are from players that haven't spent a lot of money in the game besides you have 1k hours compare the money you spent to all the other games you play. Just out of curiousity:)
---
Any characters level 80, if you want to by pass that: TP To Friend.
---
grow lamps aren't free.
---
Oh I have beaten the story and the expac. I’ve also beaten all of the living world season 4 maps. But if ANet is trying to grow the game and they introduce a mount that requires beating literally the entire game to achieve, that’s a huge investment for the players they are trying to bring in. And then there’s the fact that several core story segments are still really buggy and crash a lot. The Timberline Falls segment and the Arah story path are notorious for crashing for me or my wife whenever we have done it. 
---
 I’ve had two friends that I recently showed the game off to and they asked about all the mounts running past us. They weren’t exactly thrilled already that the raptor wuld require them to jump way late in the story to get, so when they are online I typically don’t use my mounts.
---
250*
---
I believe that they accelerated it so much because at the time they were planning on making it the last season of the whole living story (i.e. when they were moving people off to work on the unannounced projects, and weren't even thinking about another expansion). That's why they decided to wrap everything up, and that's why we got the season we have, with the main plot of gw2 pretty much over.
---
I guess I define "progression" differently from "grinding for a ton of gold." They're pretty much admitting the content can't stand on its own feet by forcing people to wait multiple days just to access it. 
---
I unlocked all the characters from Smash Ultimate in a day or two, and they're still incredibly fun several months down the road. When they release DLC characters, I get them immediately, and they're also fun. If Nintendo said "no, you'll actually need to play against the CPU for a week to get Joker" the fanbase would riot. Why does gating content behind grind in GW2 do anything better?
---
**THE GOOD**
---
* The Kralkatorrik chase scene was good.
---
* The new soundtracks were amazing.
---
* The new map was great. Exploring the back of an elder dragon and shards of the divine realms that make use of all the masteries we have so far.
---
* Skyscale is fun.
---
* I have to say, I was glad to see Aurene alive.
---
* "Praise Joko!"
---
**THE BAD**
---
* No Canach :(
---
* The last battle was "meh" compared to Balthazar's and Mordremoth's.
---
* A new meta is appreciated, however this one is a cheapened version of Dragon Stand.
---
* Those boulders during the chase scene weren't exactly fair game...
---
* The map further proves that maps made every other way of movement mastery pointless. It's nice to have them there, sure, but not using the mounts is severely handicapping your movement options. The more movement options they introduce into the game, the more this problem will persist.
---
**THE UGLY**
---
* Aurene's death was a complete misshandle, and exposed how manipulative Anet's publicity can be. Character stories about Aurene's death and coping, streamer reactions, interviews; heck, even the trailer of War Eternal was a manipulative tear jerker with a quote that makes absolutely no sense given that Aurene revives 5 minutes into the start of the episode... Heck, the whole War Eternal trailer is a pointless lie considering that. Most people were sure this would happen the way it did and I'm completely ok with Aurene reviving because she consumed Lich magic, but it was written in such a cringey and rushed way that seemed to replicate those pointless Disney moments of "Oh gosh no the hero died! ...OH YAY IT'S ALIVE!".
---
* The Skyscale collection timegate. I can't believe that given the feedback they've had in the past about collections this is still a thing. This is the laziest way possible to make people stick with the game possible; it's simply not fun, people will complete it and the game will be abandoned again. In fact, I would be surprised if it doesn't happens faster, as some people doesn't even seems to want to continue the collection at this point.
---
* The writting, compared to their previous seasons, was overall rushed and all over the place. I can't believe this is the treatment they gave to characters such as Palawa Joko, Kralkatorrik, and Destiny's Edge. Kralkatorrik was the dragon that pretty much STARTED GW2, that gave Destiny's Edge a reason to break apart and become our mentors. And they didn't even bothered to make that important. No Eir and Snaff coming with the mists army to help us, no mention from Logan or Rytlock of how important this was. NO ZOJJA STILL.
---
* Final map of the season, and I hope it stays this way for some time now. It's not healthy to introduce so many maps with pointless metas all the time, they still get abandoned after collections are done and again, make it look like this is a "fast food MMO" and not something you invest your time into. New players, beware.
---
my question is if a single person in anet tried playing the game to get the skyscale.
---
if i was in the office i'd have had this reaction and none of this bullshit would have been released
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/mightyteapot/clip/BloodyInterestingWaffleKappaWealth](https://www.twitch.tv/mightyteapot/clip/BloodyInterestingWaffleKappaWealth)
---
Its not ridiculous, its to keep people playing the game. If it was something people could unlock in a day we would have threads saying "content is to easy" or "not enough content in game".
---
People just need to understand you dont deserve to have all content unlocked within 6 hours of playing.
---
The throw 100 embers one is super super easy because you don't actually have to "throw" 100 embers, you just have to hit 100 enemies with thrown embers. So if there's a cluster of 3 or 4+ enemies, you can just start chucking embers at the group and get credit for each enemy you hit.
---
Soul binders are similarly easy if you're quick and know the timing. You can get those easily during Olmakhan phase 3 where there are those dirt/rock piles or whatever all around the camp (just mount up and start hitting your special action key), and then during the Kralk fight assign yourself to pylon duty and just fly all around dismantling the floating purple crystals.
---
In a single Kralk fight where no one else was doing pylons, I was able to know out like 25-30 at once.
---
&gt; Nobody said a thing when Aurora required every map,
---
Because aurora is a cosmetic and doesn't offer any new gameplay. Legendaries are for all intents and purposes skins.
---
Its not even remotely the same thing. This mount is one of the few pieces of significant content with unique gameplay attached to it that we've gotten in the past 5 months.
---
yeah the bone trash mobs aggroing from 2k range is pretty annoying
---
If you couldn't even read it then wtf did you even respond to?
---
Which makes game gambling even worse!
---
I agree with Belgium. loot boxes need to be banned worldwide. They're predatory as hell
---
ROAR ROAR GRRR ROAR
---
See my comments. One guy did never kill zaithan and he could not contuine. It could also be a bug, of course. Idk if the skyscale quest checks your acccount progress or just the char.
---
There were no timegates this bad on Beetle. We had LeyLine Anomaly and MkII but you could still complete the collections in a few hours. Why put it on Skyscale? It just encourages people to rush content to not fall behind. I understand you don't "have to get it now" but many people were hyped about it and the extreme timegate kills it. What Skyscale brings is not worth the tedious collections. I think I'll stick to my griffon for world completion and WvW until this is sorted out.
---
&gt; First; where the hell can I find the dps benchmark golems?
---
Lion's Arch Aerodrome special forces training area. You need to be in a squad to enter, but that squad can just be you.
---
If you would give yourself  5 fcking minutes just to think about it some more you would new it was the best call to have. Everyone new whats gonna happen and figured it out back then. Dragging it on and on made no sense at all. We got explanation to everything, simple, and one making sense. We got epic conclusion to one of the major plots of this game I wanted to see since the Edge of Destiny came out. Could it been done better, sure. Was it bad? Hell no. And most of the people seems to agree with me on that.
---
Tell that to every PvP player.
---
Obviously were talking about pve here.
---
Next tier is setting up a college fund for your skyscale.
---
Shit so I basically missed it again ...
---
Ty a lot for the quick answer :))
---
it doesnt-   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ac6qcy/new\_pf\_player\_cant\_reach\_any\_mastery\_points/ed67krf/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ac6qcy/new_pf_player_cant_reach_any_mastery_points/ed67krf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Funny, sad and true at the same time :P
---
Nah, you're just making it a different thing when it shouldn't be. The skyscale is apparently a mount that require much more effort than any other, then it's pretty much a "legendary mount" just like the griffon.
---
It'll probably fall a few days from now as those with the least patience and most gold rush the tp.
---
Awesome!
---
You completely missed the point.
---
Everyone saw this coming miles away, yes. But it being planned long before doesn't mean it's good. Just because it was clued at doesn't mean it's good. It just means they had planned a bad plot twist (if you can even call it that) to begin with. And I don't WANT anything, I'm treating the story as it is. 
---
Please tell me, on a narrative stand point, what's the point of killing a character, if you bring it back to life ten minutes later. What does it do? Does it have any consequence? Does it affect anything? Did it affect the narrative? The characters? The story development? Absolutely not. It had no effect on anything. Therefore, it was pointless to begin with. The story could've perfectly evolved with Aurene being injured, healing up, and then us jumping back to chase Kralk. It'd have had the same result.
---
I'll repeat myself, but Anet made a whole point about that death. It made a whole communication campaign about how that death would have big consequences and people should tune in to see the "lasting effects on GW2's narrative". What were those lasting effects? None, because that whole part was purely and simply pointless. It's narrative 101, if you kill off a character, make it so it's actually meaningful, and don't bring it back ten minutes later.
---
If you enjoy this kind of Twilight-level of writing, good for you. Doesn't mean I have to put up with that kind of bullshit, and doesn't mean I shouldn't point it out for them to actually try and improve to make it better.
---
Does it really matter? Cosmetics with no gear treadmill says everything you do and not do is irrelevant. 
---
Gw2 players are so damn entitled and whiney
---
Would you ban slot machines as well, then?
---
It's literally free content. Dunno why they'd need a "selling point", but they chose to advertise it, which is cool!
---
Thats the advantage of logging in and getting the LW for free. You either get it for free (the time they give you is more than generous enough) or you pay.
---
&gt; I dont complain for the sake of it.
---
Are you sure?
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced heroes of different classes there that can guide you to the right direction.
---
Alternatively please check out this [class guide](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play).
---
Gotta say it. You can't mix red and blue to get cyan.
---
While I fully understand both directions, experience has led me to the conclusion to just accept it how it is. It's a mount I can unlock, and if I do the collection, I'll have to do what needs to be done. 
---
Of course its sad when the implementation isn't as enjoyable as it could've been and y'all are absolutely right to let them know about it so that they can improve in the future. But I guess for now we will just have to accept what we got, hope for a stealthy fix in some regard and work for an optional mount to have fun with at some point.
---
Ahah yeah I mistook you for someone else, I thought you were saying it's a bad mount AND that it shouldn't have a collection. Sorry ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I'm not really good at math. How many regular (not charged) quartz does it use?
---
Not sure if you changed it but when I was looking at the unlocks the other day I noticed the Thunderhead keep mini's weren't being displayed as 'Living Story 4' (without wardrobe unlock ticked), just a minor thing though. Keep up the great work! (:
---
Youre exactly the kind of players gw2 doenst want, so its being pretty successful at not enticing idiots, total ignorants and trolls into its community. 
---
Id hardly call that a failure. 
---
If you cant comprehend that restrictions are there to keep the game healthy and free from gold spammers, and that this game isnt those other shitty mmo you mention, thats on you, not the game or its community. 
---
Stop wasting your time trying to entice reactions on a subreddit about a game you clearly dont enjoy, why dont you just do something you enjoy instead? Are you trying to be miserable on purpose?
---
You forgot to mention we also need to grind jewel crafting
---
Slot machines are regulated by a government body that ensures some sort of fairness.
---
Arenanet can change the loot table as they want without telling anyone.
---
Then you should be happy that so much collections are needed to earn it, yaaay it's not a simple "press F and ride" thing that'll make you leave the game for another three months! And you can do a little bit of each collection everyday! Yaaay!
---
I agree that we need more asura characterization, but I would also argue that Inquest Phlunt isn't out of thin air. I remember in particular when I played S2 a while back that it was really convenient how the Inquest showed up right after Phlunt was denied Taimi's work. Almost as if he sent them out to retrieve her research.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to have more non-villain dicks, but I also think it's been relatively obvious for a while that Phlunt is in the Inquest, and a reveal like this would be good to just tie up the old thread. With all that said, maybe the decision to not use him this season shows that they're going to do a twist and have him remain just a dick.
---
How timegated steps afffects new player? Does he intend to play this game for 1 week and be done? He have basically whole game to explore. Timegate for him is trivial since he can do part of it everyday and do something else. Veteran players are the ones who were screwed the most by this timegate. They already explored all game and doesn't wanna spend several days for this collection because they don't have anything (meaningful fot them) to do.
---
Idk about that. Celestial is at least meta for those relationship runs.
---
A legendary trinket we got through LS3, which required every past episode. Pretty much the same thing, high effort and investment, for a high reward.
---
I have a (more than) full time job and a kid. So I can't play as much or as often as I was when I was a wee lad. So timegating for me sucks the fun out of being able to focus on one goal or task with my limited time.
---
And this game has tons of content so I only have so much I can focus on. And it's hard keeping track of what is time gated and what to craft and it isn't realistic for me to craft all timegated material everyday for when I need it. Especially when I dont have the time to grind for said materials (or gold to buy it).
---
I'm not saying it shouldn't exist, but I am for removing timegates of "outdated" content and/or not being so prevalent throughout the game. 
---
Imho, The only thing that should be timegates are legendary crafts. Anything else is an overly done stall tactic.
---
Tldr; No time for keeping up with timegates. Kills that material for me and realistically takes MUCH longer than the typical "shortest" timeframes.
---
Yeah, i looked at my storage and was like, oh i already have all of those i need. I leaned long ago to try and keep all the stock of the timegated mats i can.
---
Whenever people bring up entitlement ("what, you can't be bothered to WORK for this mount?"), they almost always end up being these smug, "I have something you don't have, ha ha ha *ha* HA *ha* **HA**" types. They revel in scarcity, in "being first", in being able to "look down" on "lesser players."
---
And they always use that word, "entitlement." I'm so fucking sick of it. I work 9+ hours a day, and then work towards these collections. I don't have kids, but many do. I don't have school, or church group, or whatever else in the real world to *further detract* from my availability to play, just excessive hours of work that sometimes bleed into my weekends. And while I managed to get griffon over a length of time (a week), I respect that some people just don't have the time or energy at the end of the day to put towards it. Why is it entitlement to want a "lesser model" of the griffon, as someone who already *HAS* griffon, to be more easily attained (especially for those more-casual players that don't yet have griffon)? It would literally have zero negative impacts other players to make Skyscale a more reasonable, attainable collection.
---
On the flip, accessibility is a *good thing* for getting new players engaged; new players that might go on to explore raiding and improve the health of that scene, new players that might go on to try PvP and improve the active playership of that scene, new players that might even just dick around in metas new and old, improving map populations by simply existing there and participating.
---
That "entitlement" defense? Yeah it's a sure sign of a gatekeeper when thrown around, an elitist prick that would rather starve new players of accessibility than see the game potentially flourish, and it's beyond sickening that it *still* crops up so often.
---
So from one griffon-owner seeking Skyscale accessibility for new/casual players to another, thank you for stating your piece here. I wish more people interacted with the game as you do, and didn't put up with the elitist "I only have fun if I have something no one else does" mindset.
---
There isn't much pressure to pick "perfectly" on the first try. Even free accounts get 2 character slots, and within a profession you're free to change your build, skills and weapons any time. Feel free to experiment! :)
---
Not better at all. That would make the copper/silver fed salvage kit useless and worthless, which means less money for anet. 
---
I could see a dolyak being a 2 person mount or just a flavor one, but it being a bank or a shop is too much. 
---
Maybe it could have like 5-10 slots, like an inventory? But not linked to your bank or your inv so you can only access it if youre on the dolyak. 
---
Otherwise it breaks the game.
---
I've already given my opinion on this elsewhere. As the Skyscale is optional, if the collection wasn't time gated I'd be liable to try and do it in one sitting (as I did with the griffon and roller beetle). With it being time gated, I'll likely spend more time on the associated maps doing random events once the collection is done which will increase how much I play that particular piece of content.
---
For example, I played Draconis Mons loads because I was there for the druid stone collection which was time gated. Siren's Landing I barely touched because I didn't have a reason to go back.
---
Regarding other games, one difference there is that it is DLC. You are paying specifically for those Smash Bros characters. We aren't paying directly for the Skyscale and it is more like the unlock of Mewtwo back in melee where you were, literally, time gated for one of the unlock methods.
---
The characters in Smash Bros are arguably the big draw and not really comparable to a different way to travel around an MMO.
---
No worries.
---
People wanted more side quests, here we got brutally huge quest that spans whole world and multiple playing session to complete. And yet, people complain again.
---
I am at early stages, but I already quite enjoy it. It takes me back to pretty places, finish missed achievements...
---
Compared to this, the griffon quest was just tutorial.
---
But well...I do look at it to go through it and enjoy the process...and have a final reward on top of it.
---
You get keys from doing events. More events = more keys = more chests you can open. Not sure if there is a daily or character limit though as I never hit it.
---
22 x 25 = 550.
---
wtf are you talking about. did ppl complain they got jackal/griffon/beetle too fast? no
---
"ppl who arrived later and unable to progress stuff that cant be soloed" - all collections are soloable. you need to do djinn event in vabbi and meta event in elon riverlands, sth that LFG exists for or even map chat. ppl do these events regardless of mount unlock.
---
thx!
---
The hero I needed!!!! thanks
---
25 regular fuse to one charged, so 25 x 22 = 550.
---
Oh?
---
Must have missed when [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celebration_Hat) was made available again.
---
And thank you, my friend. I agree wholeheartedly.
---
stop crying
---
You don't. It's probably an oversight. But spirit shards are worth very very little anyways. It's unfortunate, but in the realm of loosing a few silver over a long play session. At most.
---
They forgot the step where you can pay to get it *now*.  God knows they'd make a fortune if they added 'Premium Skyscale Feed - Unlocks all Skyscale Achievements' - 4000 gems' to the store.
---
550
---
Lol it's the first time when I heard someone say "I worked in the industry and..." that sounds believable.
---
Even if you lied about that... You know what you're talking about xD
---
&gt;I too left the game mostly because it is way too grindy.  I found the story somewhat interesting and I am thinking of coming back to play it just for the story.  But Im probably only coming back for that and only because the game I left it for is also in a content drought.  This probably doesnt sound that dire but when you consider the countless hours and thousands of dollars i put into this game it should say something that someone like me has just up and quit.
---
Yeah... I've defended the time-gating but that was back when people were whining that they had to wait 1 day for an egg to grow up. This is incredibly stupid and really sours me to the idea of playing. I get that they want this to be an experience similar to getting something like Mawdrey, but it really kills my interest.
---
Tell that boy to stop overreacting
---
I also hate the characters (especially Taimi) so that certainly doesn't help. Eir was the only good char but she ded
---
No, collections take time to add. In particular when they have to populate maps with pick ups. 
---
This was planned from the start. Poorly.
---
I'd like to see her face when she says that. What a true yandere...
---
It's still incredibly stupid. One item gets exploited and instead of deactivating the item and just ficking over those who purchased it, they decide to fuck over every single player.
---
Okay, so? If your friend is such a whiny wimp that's his*her very own problem.
---
This whole 'cancel culture' is simply ridiculous imho.
---
Oh I hate the collection itself too, the timegating just makes it worse.
---
I'd much rather it be like pay 5k gold or do a raid boss to get it
---
This is something that annoy me personally. They mostly keep putting the same materials in recipes/ collections (Linseed Oil f.e.) or use the materials that already have many uses and a market value, while other items have to be sold to a vendor because TP value is too low. Obviously a Grow Lamp makes sense, we're hatching eggs, but I have like 200 more types of rocks/gems I could feed them instead of Quartz.
---
not to me
---
Can I have their stuff?
---
Sunk cost and addiction
---
Nobody's forcing you to read. This sub doesn't owe you anything.
---
&gt;This is how you end up with the tons of fb/ren fractal pugs with poor might uptime.
---
thats warrior's fault for not going ps
---
Dungeon weapon skins is nail in the coffin for wardrobe unlock value imo.  Was good while it lasted!
---
Welp. Hope he finds something he enjoys.
---
As much as I hate the time gate shit and have been vocal about it, I have no plans to quit a game I love and have put hundreds of hours into because of one mount.
---
Well pls go. No one is begging you to stay or listen to your input. I honestly cannot stand hypocrites like you. This isn't a "tantrum"; is a legitimate complaint with the game. It's actually all over the official forums too. If you don't like it, then get the FUCK out. No one is asking for your moaning and bitching on MY thread.
---
&gt; What does it do?
---
It leaves a cliffhanger. This is an episodic story, it's built as such and not as a one-piece story. It'd be bad if it was in the middle of an expansion story that you play in one go, but it's not.

Look at tv series, for decades they've been full of episodes that end with something important that is resolved in next episode, and would be nearly meaningless if it wasn't cut in episodes. You just don't build episodes in the same way you build a single-piece story. And gw2 LS is inspired from tv series.
---
I, for one, am SO happy, that for once I didn't have to do a single world boss for a collection because I absolutely loathe that "content". Hopefully there won't be world bosses further in the skyscale collection...
---
Acting as a nearly unkillable, figurative lightning rod for enemy attention while my stealthed Daredevil bf can get into position against 2-3 enemy roamers is exactly why I run it anyway lol
---
With what, your bare hands?
---
I'm fine with the after story completion, but I definitely would have liked to have used the mount to its fullest in the map, not 9 days (at least) later when I've exhausted the map.
---
So much this. People crying because they have to do stuff or have episodes that were available for free twice... infuriating rofl
---
They removed Mini Clockheart (aetherpath) at some point but added it back in with the last update, they probably just check some filters and throw it all in?
---
Yes indeed!
---
I actually like the nightfall story, kormir didn't really bother me, and I didn't realize people hated her until all the memes came out.
---
Traherne is whatever. I don't dislike his character, but I kinda dislike sylvari in general so that doesn't help. Didn't hate him tho
---
And I'm making the point that almost nobody cares, because spirit shards have never been in short supply from other sources.
---
I've given lots of good faith replies but I don't fancy arguing against constantly moving goalposts. Thanks for the chat though!
---
What a well executed attack on a mobile typo that I'd managed to correct prior to your reply. Regardless, you seem to be a very angry person and will be blocking you. I hope you relax for the sake of your health.
---
Comments here are so cute. Come on, best mmo community, more vitriol :)
---
If he was gone for 6 months, he didn't just quit. He just chose not to come back.
---
he should try bless offline, he can have fun there
---
No, just realistic.
---
Hey, let's make money by selling dragon skins! Sounds like good business!
---
Oh wait no one buys skins because no one owns the mount yet. Woopsies. Sales 101, more like Sales LOL.
---
She was never ashed anyway... so no I still reject the Joke.
---
That's okay, I forgive you :)
---
They researched before they downloaded, picked Engineer deliberately. If they looked up any older guide to play engi (RIP Wolfineer's site) they would have been told all about combo field use because even in their overshadowing they remain important to engineers, what with them getting access to 90% of the fields and a ton of blast and leaps.
---
ewwww this place is fucked
---
get on that, will ya
---
Lol I was gonna come back for the mount but nevermind.  
---
This game needs to make up its mind: is it for casuals or not?  It's like half of the game was designed for casual play and half for non-casual play and now both groups are chronically dissatisfied.
---
Thou shalt not suffer a jacaranda to live.
---
you can. I just got a spirit shard in a PoF map while having the collection active. It just doesnt show progress in the xp bar.
---
Just because you don't care doesn't mean almost nobody cares.
---
Map:  Dragonfall  
---
Reason: It just felt unique, fun, and brought in a lot of fun assets. Very fun meta as well, though the final part of the meta just felt like a blobfest when everything prior felt more organized.  
---
Story: Daybreak  
---
Reason: It truly gripped me. I felt a REAL sense of urgency during a scripted story in order to reach Taimi and save her. This was the first time in Gw2 that I've ever felt like I was on a nonexistent timer. I genuinely take it as the episode that felt the most impactful for me because of that. Great writing and storyboard for that instance.
---
I would like to know that as well :)
---
How many tomes of knowledge are in your bank?
---
Can I have his gold?
---
I disagreed with the exact example you brought up but sure, by all means
---
I always had it off because I thought it looked better, but recently I turned it back on and I thought that it made things look more lively. I assumed that they had made some tweaks to it over the years.
---
Well if you quit over such a petty reason all i can say is good riddance
---
Reaper.
---
How to Train, Feed, and Raise your Dragon
---
0 because I do a key run every single week and my total WvW and PvP playtime for last 365 days is maybe 2 weeks.
---
Can confirm. Prioritizing this content over anything and everything else just to get it over with and return to doing what I actually want rather than what the game forces me to do or else punishes me for missing a day not doing it.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

He did, not me, spill your hatred over something else
---
What were some challenges about creating the Kralk fight? I was surprised that we got to see all of him considering that you guys never actually made a full dragon in recent memory (i.e. Primordus and the most recent Kralk fight).
---
I'm really glad you get to "rent" the Skyscale - I didn't care for the experience of using it at all, so when I found out it was coupled to a massive collection a lot of people are complaining about I just shrugged and focused on 96% map completion with my alts.
---
I may get it eventually but I'm in absolutely no hurry to do so.
---
Then them leaving means nothing to us.
---
Tell them we're all happy to hear they left. Hopefully they find a game that doesn't hurt their feels.
---
RNG can be done well if it isn't *true* RNG.  To get what I mean, take this example: there is a drop that has a 1/10 chance of dropping from a boss.  True RNG is every time you kill the boss, there is a 10% chance of getting the drop.  This sucks because it is entirely possible to run the boss 20 times and never get the drop.  
---
However, you could use a system that weighs the probability of getting that drop over X number of runs, so on the first run there is a 10% chance of the drop occurring.  But, if you are on your 5th run and still haven't got the drop, there is a 25% chance of getting the drop.  By your tenth run, every run has a 50% chance of dropping the item and by, perhaps, your 15th run the drop is guaranteed if you have not got it yet.
---
That's if there are no more timegates.
---
Make a muzzle for your troublesome skyscale by combining mystic coins, ectoplasm and some BDSM elementalist outfits in Mystic Forge! With each passing day your skyscale is 15.3% (repeating of course) more muzzled!
---
Make 4 chunks of riding harness from 3 Elonian Leather, 3 Deldrimor Steel and 3 Spiritwood each! You can apply one chunk to your skyscale per day! Don't forget to craft spurs, saddle and tailtip in three additional highly interactive and engaging collections that require at least 5 completions of Serpent's Ire!
---
It doesn't matter, Anet needs to get out in front and address the community about this. Its fine if the Stream is going to have the stream as intended by the game director needs to address it before the actual stream starts. Putting their head in the sand like this and ignoring it only tells us that they don't care about it and it was put in solely to slow down players.
---
I'm not a huge fan of Sylvari myself, but Norn took the cake for me for being the most bland and generic race. To clarify I'm talking about Norns in GW2, and not what they originally were.
---
Then I'd consider you to be in the minority. Even playing casually, I still have almost a stack and a half in the bank, and do weekly key runs.
---
So where's this food you're supposed to buy for 5g each, and what's it called?
---
A legitimate complaint is stirring up drama? 🙄
---
What kind of reaction could they have expected by having collections that are unlocked through time gates, that themselves have time gated steps, which include a time gated crafted material?
---
WAS IT WORTH IT? 
---
BUT WHAT DID IT COST?
---
You can actually play though? What a completely stupid comment.
---
[FT Engi](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vdEQFAUlUUhatY1VwvLQ7FL3F14W0EfG4CGhBA9qH75OA-jhBBABVq+DW7PK/g4CAcmSQAeAA5pDAA-e) works quite well in this map.
---
If you have Commander's or Diviner's gear collecting dust you can put them on to easily maintain 6 or so boons almost permanently with 25 stacks of Might all on your own.
---
ah ok. didnt know about the drops
---
Some humans do work like that.
---
Seriously though should I just get the Griffin instead of the skyscale? I have the gold, just haven't worked on any of the collections and other stuff yet
---
You're missing the point again.
---
Yes, it leaves a cliffhanger. But what's the point of a cliffhanger if it's followed by nothing, or worse, by an event that completely negates it? It's actually nice that you're talking about TV series, because it's a good comparison. Good TV series tend to have cliffhangers that leave the spectator hanging, because those cliffhangers will have long term consequences, such as in GoT early seasons for example. The death of a character there is meaningful, serves a purpose for a character or another, and has consequences. On the other hand, what did this death at episode 5 bring to the story? N-o-t-h-i-n-g. Nothing would've changed if it didn't happen. Therefore, it was pointless.
---
While we're on the topic of time gates - can you ask the admins to remove the 10 minute posting limitation? You can time gate my mount, but don't time gate my bad posts &gt;:I
---
The griffin is anyway way better..people act like it’s equivalent to a legendary...common, really? You’re fooling yourself.
---
Except I never said people are lazy. There is two separate people talking to you, smooth brain.
---
Yeah, I also felt like it was rather short and I even had to play it over 2 days. As for Captain Marvel, it seems pretty familiar with the rushing around in space thing at the end. 
---
I don't think you can label Elder Dragons with such simple words as 'good or evil'. They are thousands of years old, have seen more beings come and go as anyone else on the planet and are living on a scale where a single life does not matter to them. They did what they needed to do: Consume Tyria's magic to keep the planet in balance. 
---
Jormag and Primordus should both still be asleep if I remember correctly, we can only wildly guess what the next threat will be. I hope it's Jormag and a new expansion but we will have to see.
---
FYI time gates are not difficulty, and 250 gold takes just as long (or longer) for a player putting in exactly the same amount of effort to finish off these collections.  The only difference is you can play as long as you want in one session if all you're after is gold farming, but if you want to finish these collections you just do a bit of work and then wait for the next day, which again does not represent any form of change in difficulty.
---
Time gating doesn't solve anything. Those who want will rush the mount in a week or whatever anyway. It only delays the inevitable content drought for a short time and at the same time annoys those who'd like to focus on the collections at their own pace without need to worry about missing the daily reset by 5 minutes or so, resulting in a full day that can't be used on working towards their goal.
---
So, which world are you on so I know to avoid Ele-Bait when matched against you? :)
---
How many charged quartz are we talking?
---
&gt; teleport scroll
---
If you are talking about scrolls sold for magic in each map, they can only be used at level 80. People were doing this with freshly created lvl1 characters.
---
Yeah i found out yesterday. It's not much
---
I don't want to know how much grinding you did to get 1400 mistborn motes in 3 days (i might even suggest it's impossible)
---
With mastery (especially wall climbing) I suspect the griffin will be effectively obsolete, sadly.
---
Skyscale Medicine up now! 
---
https://doncpauli.com/skyscale-medicine/
---
Other parts coming soon :)
---
Agreed. I'll take this over the luminescent armor achievements anyday.
---
Plus griffon only takes what, 5-10 hours to get.
---
Thank you so much for the hard work, this tool has always been a lifesaver. &lt;3
---
Gotta agree with those concerned about achievement/collection skins, they don't belong here, but Anet doesn't care probably. This just makes me feel bad. :C
---
I cannot complete this, I just ran out of gold from all the waypoints fees.
---
Thanks for telling me what I appearently do all day.
---
Worked perfectly fine for me. All you have to do is wait until the final veteran arrives, tag him and Event done. If you can, click the podium and answer the questions correctly, but depending the number of players around you you may not get the chance yourself.
---
&gt;Except I never said people are lazy. There is two separate people talking to you, smooth brain. 
---
You're making two contradictory arguments. Are people lazy and don't want to work, or should they be lazy?
---
&gt;  Well congratulations, you can work on your Skyscale a bit a day. And then go do other things with your life.
---
Why shouldn't I be allowed to work at the skyscale when its convinient? I want to put the work into it, is there any good reason to prevent me from doing it?
---
Yes, you are right!!!
---
It's amazing isnt it? I love this map!!!
---
Its the knowing there is something good that keeps them. It would be a lot easier to win the lottery if people stopped buying tickets after not winning.
---
It is yet another gift of free cash to multiboxers is all.
---
There is nothing the griffin and springer can’t do. Unless they purposely change the terrain to benefit the skyscale (which would be douchy move) I don’t see how it’s better
---
&gt;See, you'd only know there was an issue about the reset if you looked the whole thing up instead of doing it personally. 
---
Well, that's not quite true. It's easy to miss, but you can also see the 4 time-gated achievements at the bottom of the War Eternal category, and see that they all say something about the daily reset. I actually noticed them as I was looking for where to start the collection after beating the story. That said, I did assume that they weren't all needed for the Skyscale, I assumed (or maybe just hoped) the first collection would get you it and the others would get you something else.
---
22 charged quartz.
---
You need 10 for the grow lamp + 12 for the skyscale food.
---
skyscale food isn't acc bound? you mind providing tp prices if so?
---
evade spam mirage w/ greatsword is best imo.  perm superspeed, almost always dodging so unable to take damage, and your clones tag everything for you, so 0 effort.
---
I cannot wait till there is legislation banning this shit
---
Actual Skyscale pic for #13 [https://imgur.com/b8XApg1](https://imgur.com/b8XApg1)
---
This is probably the most common tactic in almost all mmo or live service games .
---
I think ArenaNet has been missing the spot with the armor sets, they're too easy to get. Weapon sets in the other hand, they're usually far harder. Feels like there's some balance missing here.
---
But yeah, Skyscale is terrible no matter what.
---
I didn't realize so many core items were not included already. Did they just get half way through the list, say "$%\^# it" and walk away?
---
Seriously...
---
and 250 gold
---
Do you need to feed it the same food (the quartz stakes) every day, or do you need to get different foods?
---
Wish we got some normal armor sets instead. You know, stuff that looks realistic. GW2 was so nice at release, now it's a shadow of its former self where everything has to be so obnoxious and over the top :(.
---
The ending was really good and I don’t think we need a ending that shows another great threat. We need a breather after fighting one thing after another.
---
I just hope it's not treated like the precursor collections and 75% of the way in we get hit with a 500+ gold in material costs.
---
Dulfy posts are time-gates as well.
---
Druids must use life/growth/plant magic no?
---
So many town clothes that could be outfits :(.
---
I came back about a month ago. I got the beetle and the griffon and they wore me out. 
---
I was really excited to play, and now me and my 10 IRL guildies have just stopped playing again. Too much work. We already work 12 hours a day.
---
how much gold do I have to spend as basically a new player with no saved up matts
---
And I won't be getting mine probably for several months... due to just returning after several years and needing to catch up on LS and both expansions. Ah well, gives me the time needed to accumulate the needed charged quartz at least.
---
The majority isn't going to like being forced to tune in for this spesific grind if it's timecapped at 3 weeks. You missed a day? Too bad, you'll have to shove it further aside. Too busy? Couldn't play that play that week. I'm sure casuals will keep up and that general players will enjoy the wait after the superficial hype.
---
I don't even care anymore. I'll just do the collection meanwhile I wait for Classic WoW beta key.
---
Which I already had by the time I was done with the core game, LW seasons and expansions.
---
I'd rather pay 250 gold again if it meant I could work on the skyscale collection at my own pace.
---
I don't care, for ppl that can play only few day in a week this is madness, if i want those crap of mechanics i will go to play to a monthly fee mmo
---
Ya this is a rough one since I like to knock out new stuff and get back to WvW, I've struggled through some time gated stuff before, and where I might find the story, map, music, and everything else fun, I've considered dropping the game before over stupid collections. I wouldn't leave over a time gate on it's own, but the thought of the game leaning more in that direction always make me uneasy with the feeling of playing more catch up than playing what I enjoy. And, I feel like if I just don't bother with this collection, it will bite me later when I run into something else I need that requires it.
---
Oh I didn't realize those were only available at level 80. Thanks!
---
A great final Map for a LW season. And might actually kick Siren's landing from my no.1 Lw Map.
---
The scavenger hunt that has you revisiting pretty much the same locations 3 times in a row was repetitive, but I do enjoy the collection as well.  
---
The issue I see most people having, is that the time-gates serve no good purpose. I finished the first collection early into my second day of playing, and now I have to wait until the next day to even start on the second collection? Why?
---
yeah I have no idea why people make this argument, you know exactly when a world boss is going to spawn and they are always enough people at them to be able to accomplish it easily. It's not like when I did Serpent's Ire for Mark Y and had to look up the calendar for an event-running guild to see when they do an organised run 1/2 days a week.
---
'Not taking long' is not an objective measure of difficulty, which I thought I'd made clear by stating in two different ways in my post.  If there were no time gates, you could pretty easily have the skyscale within a day or two as well.  The time gates add time and nothing else.  In fact, you could argue they make it easier because now you're more likely to still see people in the areas you need to be after the first few weeks of the update.
---
After the last armor set (Requiem), I was very happy with how this one was handled. Achievements for a box with the first tier; you don't unlock all the skins but you get an Exotic Armor set (Diviner's too which is pretty decent) and a recipe to make the others. Then you can buy the upgraded skin for a reasonable amount of Ectos, Spirit Shards, and Map Currency; perhaps not cheap but fairly reasonable things to ask for a fancier skin. The only disappointment is that I don't believe there is an achievement for unlocking all the skins like with Requiem, but I wouldn't expect an Ascended Armor box or another notable reward from this; just would have been nice to have an Achievement and maybe a few AP to track it.
---
That said, I don't think Armor Set and Mount are directly comparable things. I don't think the mount should be as time-gated as it is, at the very least I wouldn't time gate unlocking the new collections even if within the collection there are some timegatey things like World bosses or X per day.
---
Difficult? Who the hell thinks it's difficult? Who are you talking to that is actually annoyed at this garbage and finds it difficult? Who are you responding to? Whatever, I don't wanna know. You do you.
---
They're not trying to get $10 from all humans. They're trying to get $1000 from some humans.
---
If you ever saw how much EA makes from people buying ultimate team packs vs the amount they make from the sales of the games themselves, it'd all make sense.
---
You weren't looking for deeper discussion. Nor did I volunteer to enter into such a thing. You vomited your opinion onto the screen, and demanded I defend against whatever points you made. Now you're calling me a slur, and once again being toxic as fuck, so this is when I blocked you.
---
At this point, I am running between the 5 bridges I found, seeing if an event is active... It probably could have been 20 or even 15 to be more in line with the others.
---
The time gate issue would play no part in ticket support time.
---
They should really do a wardrobe check for new pieces to see what it's going to clip through or just doesn't connect with very well. The new chest piece looks good but doesn't fit well at all and looks entirely stupid with all but maybe two or three shoulder pieces, for medium at least.
---
Your going to lose your mind with how awesome the class upgrade thingies are if you haven't finished PoF and HoT! They're so good and a lot of fun!
---
Okay okay I *miiight've* missed a word or two. 
---
Either way, we're fucked. Sbubbles will probably respond by putting chemicals in the water and turn the heket gay.
---
It isn’t about blowing stuff out of proportion. It is the fact that is lengthens the life of a already short episode and the fact they never communicated that you need all the content to unlock it. They communicated poorly again. The time gated stuff is just the cherry on the cake
---
Ah balls
---
Hold up...  legendary armor gives free digit swaps and attribute changes.  That’s a ridiculously big QoL upgrade for raiders.  Not just “medium” lol.
---
LOL Exactly! You nailed it perfectly! :D
---
&gt;I don't like that they were even thinking of making Phlunt a villain.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Sure he's not a likeable character. But he serves one very important role: Characterization for Asura. We need grumpy, unfair characters like Phlunt because they represent a very important part of the Asura personality.
---
You're completely right and I agree, though killing him would have been incredibly cathartic.
---
“Calling u a slur” lmaoooooo I’m not white bro, that’s the type of language I use. It’s not a slur when my people use the word, it was used as a slur against us. You’re ridiculous.
---
As someone in the same boat... it's not that bad because WvW rewards are purely a function of time invested. I got 14 transmutation charges completely by accident in the time it took me to get my warclaw, and that was maybe 6 hours? Just use a booster and guild bonus.
---
But how would we have known it wasnt hostile?
---
That' would be episode 1 stuff, and a huge cop out (if they showed the dragon at the end of this episode.
---
Oh but you're so impatient, you want everything immediately, stop being so entitled, you whiny brat bla bla bla, why don't you just NOT DO IT? it's optional (because the rest of the game isn't, you fucking mouthbreathing fanboys) and therefore that justified lazy collections hiding empty content.
---
Finally, my watchwork pick and home node start pulling their own weight. 😎
---
How you know it cost 600 gold ?
---
There is a skyscale scale behind a waterfall,  as it happens
---
Guys! Anybody has preset for new reshade with effects close to this [https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/3312/](https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/3312/)?
---
Personally for me it is best preset for me, but currently im trying to run game with dx 12, and above doesnt work (gemfx and so on old things)
---
Could be a few days up to a couple weeks, last time some big patch dropped with issues average wait was around a week and a half. Just want to add **Do Not submit another ticket or add to your current one** It'll only push it back further and you'll have a longer wait time.
---
&gt; Whilst technically true, it doesn't tell the whole story. From behaviour I've witnessed, and heck done myself, collections push players to be very objective driven. If they need a specific event, they either wait at the spot it starts, or go off to do another part of the collection. So whilst yes, it brings players to the map, they aren't really doing the map's content. They're waiting for the one thing they need before they leave.
---
I do not think that that's true at all. When I and everyone else was doing the Druid backpiece, for example, the meta events were always filled whenever they came up, because why wouldn't you pause whatever solo heart you were doing to get a quick bag of loot?
---
&gt; I would argue this issue is better fixed by making more fun and rewarding maps.
---
You cannot possibly do it for every map, it's unsustainable. There will always be a handful of maps that have the best gold/hour/effort ratio. Also, those maps were the first to have deep metas, they were basically all that we had for years. A huge portion of the community knows how to do those maps, so basically any time there are people on the maps, you can be sure that there will be enough leaders on the map to move things along to success. That's not true for new maps. You need lots of people there to have the community knowledge take root and grow in the most people possible, quickly, so that in a few months when the next map comes out, you're still likely to always have at least a few people on those maps who know what's what.
---
&gt; The map lacks a good meta event, it also lacks long term rewards such as weapon sets and armour skins.
---
Compare to Sandswept Isles. Similar lackluster metas. Similar amount of new skins (read: low). But Sandswept Isles had a few timegated things (notably the backpack, but I'm pretty sure there were others) that kept people coming back to that map. It's definitely a more popular map than Kourna, and it was released earlier. 
---
&gt; Ultimately, the issues of maps being empty are down to the lack of content.
---
Are you of the impression that ANet doesn't know that maps need content, or something? What even is "content"? It's the metas, the rewards, the exploration, the lore, the boss fights, all of that. Every map has most of that stuff. This one has all of it. *It's not enough*. It can never be enough, because the players that ANet wants to stick around for a while are the hardcore players who will lead metas and develop strategies, who are happy to hoover up whatever rewards they can and then vanish back to raids and tier4 fractals. They'd be gone in 3 days without a time gate keeping them there. 
---
And the community needs them, just like the community needs the mass amount of low-information players who don't do much except follow the green arrows and the commander tags. The game's ad-hoc grouping does not function unless you have a good mix of both types of players, and the only way to keep them in the same space for a guaranteed length of time is to put a time gate in the game that *makes* them stay there for roughly the same length of time.
---
I've been thinking a lot about the nature of the dragons after this episode and how what we know about them was probably false assumptions. There's a pair of NPCs in the new map, can't remember which camp they are in, but one of them argues with the other that destruction on such a massive scale can't be nature's idea of rebalancing and I'm starting to think that he is right. There's something very paradoxical in the fact that the natural levels of magic in Tyria are enough to tear the world apart. There's been a lot of parallels drawn between the dragons and the human Gods over the years, but what if the dragons too are foreign to this universe and they brought all this extra magic from somewhere else? Maybe the reason Kralk kept going into the mists was because he was trying to go back home and reach his mother hoping for a cure to his madness...
---
The whole skyscale collections and time gating within time gating within time gating is dumb. I have the griffon and I think that was a good amount of effort and gold sink to get a nice mount. I play other MMOs like FFXIV and don't mind time gates / grind walls here and there but time gates inside time gates for a mount of all things is ridiculous game design. This makes no sense to gw2 in particular because we don't pay mandatory subscription fees, I don't see how adding extra time gates makes Arenanet money, it's just there to frustrate players. Poor design especially considering we buy the mount skins and we don't buy "game time" (subscription), if we don't have the mount why would we buy skins??
---
 I went back to play guild wars 2 because it's fun, the story is cool, and there's something unique about how the community comes together to do massive Tequatl / boss fights and HoT metas. Now I guess after I do the latest episode I won't bother with this mount at all. I can't even do the collections for the skyscale at the same time as my SO or my guildies because of the time gating.  I'll just go back to playing other games after I finish the latest episode's story, rather than be frustrated with time gates.
---
Could have continued the interaction in S5 and for instance letting the dragons be if it showed it isn’t hostile
---
I agree and disagree with this. I think they need to treat it like they did with the new armor set, by making a soft time gate for doing events multiple times. That way people can spend the whole day on the events if they want and blaze through the achievement or go at a leisurely pace and play new meta events how you normally would and get the achievement more organically. They could have an achievement like 'protect the skyscale' by completing events multiple times to keep them safe. Or getting guaranteed drop on event completion that could be fed/given to skyscales with no cap. That way the only wait is getting through the meta (ie playing the game.)
---
I have no idea. But it is a mystic forge recipe. And nothing gave me a recipe to craft it. So I assume you can craft it.
---
If you can test it out that you can craft it early, I will put it on the thread.
---
Please don't remind me of aurora and the shitty druid collection
---
I believe one day she's going to surprise us by introducing her cubs, which she was raising completely off screen.
---
Honestly, I think the Olmakahn are a fitting end to her character arc. She never quite fit in with charr culture, and always been more of a mommy type character. The family-centric attitudes of Olmakahn are probably where she can finally settle down.
---
Besides, she competes with Rytlock for the spotlight as Charr rep. And I don't know one person who prefers Rox over goddamn frigging baddass Rytlock Brimstone!
---
Honestly, the time is right for Rox to exit the main story.
---
I would have agreed, if Aurora had also taken up a mastery slot and locked you from XP spirit shards until you bought the rest of the LS3 episodes and did it.
---
I came back to play GW2 more regularly while waiting for the next FF expansion. If I get the Skyscale I would immediately drop like $50 or more into the mount adoption license and other cosmetic extras as I always do for new mounts. As it is, I'm doing LS episodes and when I finish the latest one I won't be working on the Skyscale because this all is frustrating. The next thing I look forward to doing in GW will be the next season's episode, and I will just go back to FF. The time gate within time gate within extra effort is nonsense because they don't make money from subscriptions, making it take longer is simply frustrating for casual players like me without netting them extra money from people taking longer to complete collections. The hardcore players of GW2 who enjoy this grind will convert their gold to gems, the casual players of this game don't have a lot of gold so we actually spend IRL money constantly on the cute shiny things in the store. If we don't log on we don't buy things from the store, we don't even see it.
---
lol, wrong. stop making assumptions about ppl motivations and how do they get enjoyment. you're not me
---
Personally I don't really care that it is time gated, but I also see why others would be unhappy.  I think it is better that it is, because it is absolutely a prestige thing rather than a utility thing, but that's neither here nor there.  My objection here is the complaint that they lied about it being easier to get than the griffon, and pointing at the time gates as evidence.  It would be a fair complaint if they claimed it would be *faster* to get, or potentially *simpler* to get, but nothing I've seen so far indicates any actual increase in *effort* required to get it.
---
You're defending the guy who made it no? This is what I was replying to:

---
You accuse me of lacking reading comprehension, but you didn't even realize what the original argument was about?
---
Reshade setup is explained, nothing more i can say.
---
I absolutely love the fact that everyone is crying about charged quartz. It's almost like you have to play the game for a little bit instead of standing afk in LA. Happy to note that I have 34 no problem with doing my home instance and feeding tons to my personal guild base. Also happy about the grow lamp being a requirement for the collection and that people who have not done a 5÷ year collection now have a harder time. Just cough up the 60g and buy it from tp.
---
medium flame legion armor is really nice too
---
What's the best farm method to get 250g in a day?
---
Same dude, it's a lull before the next expansion and so I'm doing gw episodes because there's a new one. I'm just going back to FF faster than I thought because the skyscale is frustrating.
---
Do you need the The Food, the Lamp, and the Charged Quarts? I only have 30 minutes a day to play and haven't been caught up with the collection. I got the Food and the Grow Lamp but Idk if I should make the Charged Quartz too or if I'm good for now.
---
Ehhh, you can get HoT and core stats from Bitterfrost pretty easily. It's mostly just PoF stats that are really hard to acquire. You're basically stuck with some very expensive raid backpacks and a handful of specific achievements. I think the Kourna one is repeatable at the absurd cost of like 500 Inscribed Shards or some nonsense like that.
---
"25 bridges" thing actually made people create and coordinate multimap squads to succeed. Actual faceroll map meta didn't.
---
So this is the challenging openworld content we deserve.
---
I used to get shat on for complaining about how much Anet were starting to rely on time-gating content, and for saying it was only going to get more annoying.
---
Welp.
---
&gt; Sales 101, more like Sales LOL.
---
If I was willing to buy gold, I'd give it for that, but I won't cause they still allow T_D here so, hopefully the upvote and the guarantee of my hearty laugh will suffice.
---
Eagle I think?
---
That doesn't really seem like a legitimate reason, on the minimap, the icons stick to the sides. I'd call that pretty damn disruptive.
---
I'm so glad they do tho
---
Definitely not the first, seeing as ls5 was already confirmed awhile back.
---
All of it. The entire process is a fuck you to new players without 6 years of game activity.
---
The rock under the water?
---
Skyscale needs a grow lamp and 12 food to grow. Thats 22 quartz, which means you either wait 22 days to get it or pay 140g at the market.
---
What really bothers me isn't exactly the Skyscale.  The Skyscale sucked up any chance of Dragonfall having meaningful lore.  We've got several *really cool* areas in the Underworld, The Fissure of Woe (Burning Forest) &amp; Melandru's Lost Domain.  
---
... and while true to their environmental roots, there is ***nothing*** there.  It's more GW1 lore used as tourist attractions.  
---
These areas should be cool, and when you hear their names as a Guild Wars fan, your heart flutters a bit.  They were traded for, "Mother," and while I'm excited as anyone about the implications of an Elder Dragon lineage, the emptiness of these areas leaves me feeling hollow and unsatisfied.  They were chosen as iconic locations that we'll never likely see again, and under-utilized.  
---
So, what am I getting at, exactly? The story, meta-event and the Skyscale collection cannibalized ArenaNet's normally awesome attention to detail.  The map is meta-centric to a fault and there aren't any real nods to the memory of things such as the Eternal Forgemaster, the Four Horseman or any scattered lorebooks.  These areas could be replaced by just about anything.  
---
The only reason platforming exists in Dragonsfall is to further the Skyscale Collection.  There's *nothing* to break up the tedium.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem because there would be various lore, scattered events and collectibles.  Unfortunately, ArenaNet sunk what feels like 3/4ths of their resources into an extremely time-gate heavy Skyscale Meta-Collection.  There's no jumping puzzle to relax and discover with the map or community, and I suspect we're just done with jumping puzzles period. 
---
I genuinely hope that that the Skyscale will be the first and last of such "meta-collections".  They're exhausting and the various steps aren't rewarded appropriately; whether with map currency, keys, a title, a mini or something tangible or memorable? GW2 isn't designed for this sort of a long-burn quest, and the Skyscale collection is a great example of why collections shouldn't be Matryoshka dolls. ArenaNet really should be focusing on quality over quantity with regard to the sheer number of collections. 
---
The reason the community likes "quests" like the first several Gen II legendaries, Nevermore or the Black Moa Chick in GW1 is because they involved you actually playing the game; running around doing jumping puzzles, killing bosses (eg; Sorrow's Furnace).  Whereas for the Skyscale you're mostly running around and *needlessly* backtracking (Scales, Medicine, Eggs).  Miscommunication on their part about the necessity of owning all the LS4 episodes is another sour note.  
---
The average number of achievements in LS4 is around 30.  Eternal War has 18.  I completed more than half of these within my first night, and I feel that I'll probably be done with the episode by the weekend.  Story and Meta-Event aside the Skyscale Collection is really something akin to approximately 80% of the content in the patch minus some easy armor-unlocks.  If you're not doing the Skyscale collection then you're going to "run out of content," -- not because you "burned through it," like people would have you believe, but because there isn't a whole lot of depth to this release.
---
Trading skins on trading post can make lots of money really fast.
---
I think that's the beauty of gw1, it's hard, the skill limitations, the trading, the movement, you can't just jump off a building, no, you have to walk all the way back around to get where you want to go. The amount of money and time you have to spend to get weapon or armour that has the exact same stats but looks the way you wanted. 
---
Ahh, bliss.
---
yeah, it's 100% her fear of cave ins that rarely ever comes up
---
Ooooh, ooooh, will there be backstabbing and political intrigue involved in the 12 point scores?
---
Sure, fine. You could see there was quite a bit of timegating, and prepare accordingly. I noticed it too. What about the stimegating within a timegating at collection step 3 (which is also collections within a collection, what a joke)? How do you justify that?

Okay.. Name 1 thing that a player requires... "REQUIRES" the mount for.
---
Things that other mounts can't get players (Outside of any new LS achievements)
---
[Fixing an Exploit](https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1128776712890781696)
---
Not sure if this was resolved yet or not
---
you can't even start the collection until you finish the story anway
---
Every mount has its limitations. The skyscale works within that system, not based on how hard it is to obtain (or the difficulty to get it was not based on it not being a superior mount). 
---
No mount is useful everywhere — why would the skyscale be any different?
---
Everquest taught me that there is *always* something behind every single waterfall.
---
ANet has failed to comply with that expected standard, dammit!
---
The psychological torture is real!
---

---
That's the point. Since they stick to the sides, they are easier to fin, but if they were bigger they would be more annoying and cover other icons like commander tags.
---
What about a sad skyscale?
---
I wouldn't mind the timegate as much if the skyscale was actually legendary true full flight or even semi full flight, i.e. an actual PRIZE to hunt, the so called "legendary mount" as people call it, but its not even that good. 
---
The skyscale is a hybrid of the griffon and springer that's inferior to both. The griffon and the springer on their own already break every single map and make world completion a piece of cake. The skyscale's flight is less than impressive and doesn't accomplish anything you couldn't already do with existing mounts.
---
A griffon, a springer and a leap of faith accomplish everything the skyscale can and far, FAR more.
---
The only reason people THINK its useful is that the new map is intentionally designed to play to the skyscale's strength and play to all the other mount's weaknesses, i.e.:
---
* Lots of branches to hinder griffon pullups making hard to dive and gain speed or maintain altitude. Meanwhile, skyscale can hover and use the branches to refresh the flight juice.
---
* Ledges that are juuuuust outside springer's reach, but not outside skyscale's reach.
---
* Vertical ledges stacked directly ontop of one another meaning that despite springer being able to jump that high, he can't access them because he bumps his head, while skyscale can just fly around and get on them. 
---
*Multiple large cliffs that are too close to one another for the griffon to dive and pull up, too far away for springer to jump accross, but just perfect the skyscale to climb.
---
The new map is deceptive when it comes to the scale's efficiency. No other map is designed with its specifications in mind, meaning the other mounts outdo it everywhere else.
---
Yeah it will make some other mounts slightly obsolete, but considering that its behind a NINE DAY timegate at absolute MINIMUM (and that's only so far, we don't even know what collection 4 and 5 are about) assuming you blaze through everything, and requires ALL of season 4 AND sends you on a tyria wide scavenger hunt, while costing 140g in charged quartz alone then you might as well actually make it worth it.
---
Currently it takes a collosal ammount of effort for a miniscule reward. If it was buffed to actually be strong enough to justify the collection it would be better than nerfing the collection itself imo.
---
Praise Joko!
---
Not only is it hard, but it costs 1340 gold in total
---
Hard AND expensive!
---
Yea it’s done fairly well sans the gates
---
See my edited post. And "People like you" is a generalization that doesn't need to be made. Much like the one I made about age and instant gratification. I regret conflating the two. And generalizing.
---
I'm back again to ask more noob questions! 
---
What are some fun classes for new players? I have my Mesmer around 20 now, but it's pretty boring. I like the spells I get with a sword but it's generally pretty boring to play it. 
---
I usually heal in other games, could Guardian be the class for me?
---
It turned from a 5-day timegate into a 8-day timegate minimum. Yay.
---
Since nobody seems to believe me here is the settings I have and I never touched them.
---
https://imgur.com/93yC6Si
---
Which you get once.
---
As of now no one  form Anet said a peep about it, plus they deleted the poll thread on their foruns, where  over 70% were in favor of removing the timegate, it seems they just gonna sweep this under the carpet as much as they can.
---
No, game is dead, go play wow
---
Some good ole TLC!
---
Yes, his tail is in the Priory headquarters.
---
its not like i dont believe you. im just wondering because my gf got an email which stated that =)
---
I'm hoping that the UK scores will be "awakened" from their decade-long death.
---
I agree with you and some of the people responding to you (I'm sure I'll get downvoted too). With every episode people complain that they finish the content in 2 hours.   
---
So they give something to do for the next few days and everyone just loses their mind, I swear people don't even know what they want.   
---
Is it the best possible way to implement content that last longer? Probably not, but it's hardly the end of the world like people are making it out to be, such an overreaction.
---
I made a poll on the forums that got removed by Anet. Just for anyone who might want that info it has about \~200 votes and split 70% for removing the time gate and 30% for keeping the time gate.
---
Like I said in my previous comment if you were to buy everything off the TP it would roughly cost 500-600 gold. You need to grow the eggs and feed them and it is a very expensive process that requires a lot of time gated stuff within itself and to skip that, you need to buy stuff off the TP. It is very annoying.
---
Again, how you know that ?
---
Soldi...
---
5 days waiting in one sub 20 min achievement
---
not getting what you want immediately when you want it =/= being forced to wait to even put any effort into it in the first place.
---
Yasss, so good!
---
[Yikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation)
---
Actual question but I have to say the sky scale debacle weighs too much for me to care about story stuff
---
The developers have said that Zhaitan is dead, no surprise twists. His magic has also been absorbed by Mordremoth, Kralk, and Tequatl the Sunless.
---
Okay, well why are you telling me?
---
Because the few days when I have a lot of time to put into gw2, I want to be able to get as far as possible on the collection. Now I'm being punished for starting to play a little (because I want to relax for 30-60 min between studying), and then being halfway through a daily collection. If I leave the collection there, I'll only have half the content to play when the weekend starts, because after that I'm locked out. So instead I follow guides so I can complete a full daily step before the weekend so I can actually put more time into it on the weekend.
---
That's why this time cap ruins it for me. Because I enjoy playing a bit every now and then, but I also mix it in with longer days where I want to have all the content available to me.
---
I am far enough along, as are my guildies to see it and feel it in our pockets. Have you done this every day since it came out? Are you not right there with us?
---
I feel like the second skyscale collection was done better than the first- running around Tyria to collect magics is really fun, and doing Derelict Delve for the first time was really fun. Unfortunately, it looks like the third is gonna be slow going again... 
---
And I agree about the matryoshka doll thing, but meta-achievements aren't bad if done right imo. Meta-achievements can be nice- provided they give you a good reward for doing a certain set of achievements, like a significant amount of AP and new armor skins (as seen in the episode meta-achievement rewards) but too many can be exhausting, especially if you're pressured to complete it in under 24 hours.
---
I absolutely loved the S4E5 meta-achievement. It focused much more on doing different events around the map, and I completed it in about a week (I was on winter break so I played a lot every day). On the other hand, I finished the S4E6 meta-achievement in just over 24 hours (I'm on summer break now, so I've been playing pretty constantly). It was a joke. I had been hoping for achievements that would involve, I dunno, maybe kneeling in front of every god statue? Escorting the dolyaks? Something that would encourage me to interact with the map more than "Hey, go search for 21 scales and sick skyscales and another 21 eggs!". The best achievement was the waterfalls one. Not grindy, not hard- just fun to run around the map and see how beautiful Melandru's Lost Domain is!
---
If memory serves, it's part of the Asura plotline that Phlunt's been at least a tool of Inquest the whole time. The whole reason Inquest was able to get so much bigger than any other krewe, was so well funded, was that they have a three-vote majority on the Arcane Council.
---
Hmm. That's actually an interesting idea. I don't know if I agree that's the case, but it's an interesting idea. I wonder how that could be tested?
---
\^ This.
---
But what if you hate collections just slightly less than you hate crafting, and you hate crafting slightly less than _being on fire_? 
---
Cause I got this wild idea that I _already have a job in real life_ **and I think I should be able to get things in game FOR PLAYING THE FUCKING GAME!** It's not a 2nd job, and if that's what they want me to treat it as to get basic features I will stop playing. 
---
It's a mount. Not a legendary. Not even Ascended. Mount. 
---
Fuck their collection and time gates.
---
Can't wait to purchase a skyscale skin from Anet before I even unlock it!!
---
Have you heard the UK entry song? I don't have much hope for us lol
---
Timegateception.
---
When I did it I was full clearing wings 1-4 every week, and the last thing I had to do was wait for a weekly reset (twice) to get lucky enough to get the ecto drops from the chests.
---
Unlocking skins for the beetle (Ive been gone a long time) without having it unlocked was....well, frustrating, to say the least.
---
On the upside once I hit the time gates for skyscale I can finish beetle and have a galatic one. :|
---
If there is one thing Reddit (not just r/GuildWars2 ) is good at, it is making the vocal minority seem like the outraged majority.
---
This is one of the things I think FFXIV does better (in regards to drops). EG: A lot of the bosses have mounts as rewards, with a very low chance to drop. However, farm it enough (99 runs) and you can spend the token you get per run to just buy the mount. (So, either way, you're either gonna be lucky and get it early, or just grind for the guaranteed mount).
---
They removed it?  Wow. lol
---
Currently it's sell price is 4G77S71C
---
Also dying is overrated.
---
If you have PoF expansion then guard can be a very good choice for endgame support/healer. Healing in core game is rather worthless so a flashy class like ele or engi might be more interesting.
---
The big irritation for me is that loot boxes are aimed at all consumers, kids included. Casinos can't host people under 18, and there are strict laws on minimum payout rates. Loot boxes aren't controlled by the same rules. It's predatory.
---
Thanks.
---
Grow Lamp is used for two things: Mawdrey and it is one of the collection for Skyscale Toys(Part of Raising Skyscale).
---
Right? How dare we ask a company to respect our time
---
Check guides on the sidebar of this subreddit. If you had hard time the first time then boosting to level 80 is not something you want to do any time sooner.
---
and a Skyscale isnt something to show off?
---
I'm old and have an easier time organizing things on paper lol
---
It's pretty much objectively worse than the Griffon/Springer combo, particularly with the mount mastery ability to jump off your Springer at the peak of it's jump that can chain into glider and then Griffon.
---
It's simple. Arenanet evidently wants the average player to take more than 1-2 weeks to unlock the Skyscale.
---
You can cry and stomp because you want the new shiny now, but that is clearly what they are going for.
---
This look like an experiment in improving player participation in the season 4 maps, outside of providing a new broken farm spot. They may have overshoot it or it may be what actually does the trick, but time will tell.
---
So after we understand that they want the players to take more than a week or two to unlock the skyscale, how do they achieve that? 
---
Do you remove the timegates but scale everything so that even people with plenty of time and resources will have the thing only after a considerable amount of days? Or do you keep the timegates but keep the amount of content that you are expected to complete in a single day to a sensible level?
---
You can say: "But I don't want to take more than week to unlock the skyscale". A lot of people will and will show off their Skyclaw, because our idiot lizard brain instinctively equates effort with value and prestige and there is no changing that. The entire videogame industry is built on this .
---
I am not saying that complaints are not valid or that the system is perfect and should not be tweaked or improved.
---
We have had to deal with this kind of stuff for a long time. I have long realized that these timegates are there specifically to keep me playing more than i would on my know and to artificially inflate the value of certain items and materials, but at the same time i feel that the collection system is one of the best ways for nudging me in trying content and event that i may have forgotten or inadvertently ignored. We all know that the druid's stones collection has ascended to meme status, but i am still glad of having been "forced" to discover the amazing hidden lore of Draconic mons.
---
(Fuck ember bay to, throw that flaming turd of a map in the trash fire it belongs)
---
Its all the other shit too... so many fetch quests its just so poorly designed
---
You're not only entitled, you're also childish (why is that an insult) for wanting it NOW, and shush, I don't care if you say you don't necessarily want it NOW: you do because I say so to prove my point. I will also ignore all the other criticisms about the mount being heavily hyped with no hint on how grindy it was going to be (compared to even griffon, an exotic, elusive and almost easter-egg feeling mount) and the collections being lazy and poor on explanations/solid hints to make them at least feel more immersive and not so low effort.
---
Now off you go, you childish, entitled person, and don't forget: older MMOs had it worse and therefore this is ok. ^also^its^optional
---
Or they'll just quit until next LW. Maybe they could try just giving us content that's fun to play instead of chores
---
I already saw them in all sorts of places. Unless your seeing a new build every night they aren't putting anything in.   
---
I highly doubt this is the case
---
Honestly it really depends on content fun levels and on reward fun levels.
---
Lets imagine at the beginning of PoF you need to slog though 15 hours worth of content to get Raptor. In another timeline you need to feed your Raptor hatchling 1 carrot per day for 5 days instead (yes, this is a hellish timeline, I know). I'd prefer to live in the 15-hours timeline, because without Raptor it isn't fun and I'd hate to feel *I can't really experience the desert* *for 5 days* whatever I do.
---
On the other hand there's a heavily timegated legendary WvW armor that I will get some day. Do I mind that it's timegated? Nope, it is a long-term goal I can work to and *I can experience WvW fully without it.*
---
Now the question is - can I experience new map without my own Skyscale? Honestly I feel way better and faster on Jackal/Springer/Beetle/Gryphon combo, I can get anywhere I want with some clever planning (or by sheer portal luck). If I really want Skyscale, there are many nests all around the island. Yes, I am missing on mastery, but that's not crucial.
---
To sum my incoherent rambling up: I feel that timegates are awful when they restrict people from experiencing new content properly. I can't say it can be applied to the new mount.
---
Because fuck you ~ Signed, Anet
---
the longer it takes the less money they're gonna make on mount skins for it
---
Welp. I knew it.
---
......Yes I would actually if given the chance, like that's not even a question. Shut it down.
---
It's about on par with Will Smith's Genie. We're fucked.
---
Well, yeah, prices are spiking right now while everyone is trying to make a quick flip. I'm kind of surprised at the spike tbh seeing as how these aren't super rare materials being used, people are just paying out of laziness / lack of profession maybe? 
---
Festival of the Four Winds should be coming in the summer so if you're super burnt out by the here and now I guess you can look forward to that reducing the prices if you don't have it by then.
---
Well, it is same as it was with Aurora (also you had to visit all LS3 zones), now you just don't need to grind all of the content for it.
---
Pseudo Random Distribution, Turning the 64% chance your 1/10 Drop happens within 10 kills into a guarantee, in exchange for it basically never happening in under 5 kills as well as good luck streaks being neigh impossible.

He goes to sun's refuge, you might be able to find him there. He wont be inside the deeper caverns hes outside of the main entrance

Oh hell no, that'd push this even closer to a mobile game format, no thank you
---
As if your comment had any effort put into it.
---
Players should be able to decide if they need the mount or not. But if we are being pedantic, we are also not required to play the new episode or the game at all. Your point being?
---
Here's my opinion on skyscale.
---
Want it free?  Timegate it however you want.  IT'S FREE
---
Want is NOW?!? Gemstore.
---
Problem solved.
---
timegates fucking suck. Let people play the game however they want
---
Damn Kralkatorik a lil Fatty. All that magic. Wait how come he didn't utilize the death magic from Zhaitan and come back as Undead Kralkatorik?
---
*looks at username*
---
You brilliant bastard.
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
I agree. The episode, the map and the mount are beautiful.
---
I like havlng to work for something i want, instead of getting it for the bare minimum. 
---
So stop the: "bUT ThE TImeGaTESss" and just enjoy the journey which you've just received for free
---
I wasn't defending anything I was responding to your comment about "Sit around for 24 hours poking your nose." You don't have to sit around, you can do other things. If you sit around its your own fault.
---
Great. I'm happy for you. What does that have to do with the previous comment?
---
As much as I like this quote, the Skyscale blunder isn't on the same level as the Diablo Mobile blunder.
---
Ahh, so I should be good then. Thanks!
---
Just try and timegame me, I still only play vanilla gw2.
---
That would make me rofl all the way to some other game 😂😂😂
---
What if there were lots of things to do, and none of them were expensive or tedious?
---
https://youtu.be/1p-DA0zvuQ8
---
"Death magic" and "Immortality magic" do not seem to be the same. Death magic allows you to create undead, animate what should have no life. To come back from death you'll also need Life magic. 
---
I suspect a necromancer's Life Force manipulation is a combination of Death and Life magic, and that Joko had some spell on him that would drain ambient magic, filter life magic from it (like how chak filter out death magic from leyline energy) and use that to revive himself, while his death magic would keep his body from rotting, and still moving even with no biological functions.
---
Regardless, the commander and Aurene took that magic from him while fighting his torment, Fire and War, Death and Shadow, Roots and Madness. When he finally died, he only had left the magic in his core, which likely contained magics of Crystal and Lightning.  
---
The commander then broke Kralkatorrik's core  and released all of his remaining magic, and Aurene took that magic to become an Elder Dragon herself. 
---
Even if he had kept some death magic, and death magic allowed someone to resurrect themselves on death, there was no magic left Kraklatorrik could use to revive, as Aurene took it all.
---
I had this happen to me while I was on the springer, I was gonna jump somewhere, half-way one of those landed on my face. Was too funny to be salty.
---
That would explain why they put in the currency for magic vendor.

You are complaining about people complaining.  What is the difference?
---
Where did you get your numbers for the majority of players don't like your timegate?
---
There was no implication my comment did. So I don't see your point. There was apparently enough effort in my comment to warrant a reply.
---
\*You feel like you're going to have a bad time\*
---
Also, due to how timegates work in this game, if you don't play everyday, you are actually pushed back and it is frustrating to people in other timezones because it can mean that you lose a whole day due to log in too close to reset.
---
not hitting. you have to destroy them (iirc).
---
I tried that with 1 stack and lost 10g including a candy cane weapon but didn't get a charged quartz. I know I only tried 1 stack, but I'm not looking to lose more.
---
22 days if you craft the skyscale food yourself. And that's just for the collections that have been unlockable so far.
---
As someone who was very excited for skyscale I can join the many that are now really disappointed with how it's been implemented, but I think the biggest shame is that all of this had to come along with the otherwise pretty great story and has eclipsed it in the meta conversation.
---
Waiting all that time to &gt;!kill Kralk and help Aurene manifest into an elder dragon!&lt;, getting a new map to explore, getting a neat-looking legendary, only to get overwhelmed with how awful the collections and nested timegates and locked XP bar are. Just a general shame all around.
---
&gt; realistic
---
Bitch I'm firin' literal laz0rs out of my magical hammerspace projector gizmo and you're talking about realism here?! I could probably grow lamp the fuck out of that egg just by standing there preheated to 80 like some motherfucking induction oven!
---
Their form looks similar but exordium definitely takes the cake for color
---
you park a party member in bloodstone fen, tp to them and map complete it in a couple of minutes, earning a key or exotic. Bloodstone fen has a lvl 80 requirement that tp to friend bypasses, and map completion for it can be done on a level 1 toon with some skillful gliding.
---
Unlike the weekly key farm it had no cooldown earning you a exotic/key with each new toon. It was also way faster than doing the level 10 key farm, where you could skip the tutorial, pop a tp to friend and complete bloodstone fen faster than most people could even get through then tutorial, much less the level 10 quests, and those even only worked once per week, which is why after a couple of runs to confirm it worked, I reported it even though it did require one consumable per use which are not purchase-able.
---
Are you on the same character that did the story when now looking for the rest?  It could be tied to story completion.
---
Oh shit. I think I did that once with my level 70+ alt to get the rubies from the map completion. I used the ticket though before they patched it.
---
'Why are u guys so idiot?' ;/
---
Played it.
---
This is worse. Mount is designed for all to get here, feels like crap, big difference.
---
so yall just gonna remove the skyscale threads so anet cant see them? ok
---
I assume you only get one skyscale hatchling.
---
Also, from what I've read in another post, bring a friend or two or three.  It's either hard or impossible to do alone.
---
The "ordinary" medium armor looks way better than the blossoming one. I like the simple look.
---
The heavy armor looks like it was caught in a crystal explosion. And for norn woman it bares the stomach and combines badly with other armors. Although for charr normal leggings and boots are very detailed.
---
I took the light chestpiece on my sylvari mesmer and combined it with the requiem pants. It works pretty well.
---
All in all these armors are more hit and miss than requiem for sure. Some good parts but I'm happy I don't need to grind mistwhatever for all parts either.
---
Yeah, that's pretty broken. If you convert the key into gems, then into gold. That is an insane amount of gold/hour. Good thing they finally took notice.
---
Do it in a group. The additional players can shoot too, have a heal skill for for your mount and can buff the mount's damage.
---
Yeah I really like Joko because he's basically Tyria's Kim Jong Un who had a bit more luck
---
A part time job that doesn't pay you isn't content  
---
This kind of shit is why the MMO genre got buttfucked by MOBA's and all the other online gaming genres since and why WoW Classic will be a dead meme of a game in 6 months.
---
You cant sell the bags, they are account bound (see bottom of the tooltip). They have to open the bags and then deal with the mats.
---
I wanted desperately for there to be something behind the waterfalls.
---
This is the biggest problem. Nearly everything on the map involves team content which will be incredibly difficult, if not impossible to do months from now when everyone has gotten burned out after getting their mount and never comes back.

Hello. How can i join dungeons ? And is there a lot of ppl doing dungeons? Cause i have no clan or friends in GW2
---
I guess it makes sense as it's the finale and this mount is sort of the aurora of the season. But I can see how people are put off by it. It was such a huge part of the advertisement for the episode.
---
They're even looking the other way. Now I'm really disapointed. 
---
What happened to the company that hears the players and improves the game etc etc..?
---
no, they don't.
---
he was asking if you were looking for the eggs with a character that hasn't finished the story yet
---
Most of the 2.1s were that way; HOPE took me into Hylek lore, for example.

---
Congratulations you just triggered a WotLK flashback.
---
I remember when actually playing through content, or performing challenging tasks, got you rewards in video games.
---
I really don't know why they disabled rewards from core Tyria maps..
---
Of course they would be rushing it much faster, but a daily time gate is not the answer to that. My point is not that the players are delayed from getting the mount, because all things in the game are technically time gated behind some minor requirement/amount of mats, my point is that players in order to progress efficiently MUST invest an entire phase of the collection in one day to meet the daily reset. 
---
That requires rushing through content efficiently, not actually experiencing it or taking your time at your own pace to chip in on it. If a player want the mount they must now play at the pace of the daily reset, and with the size of these collections that equates to a pretty damn fast rate of progression to meet that daily investment.
---
Chonky boi.
---
&gt;There are some parts of the map you can't explore with only the base game
---
That's not true. All core game maps can be fully explored on foot
---
Story dungeons perhaps.
---
Make them pay 3x the Price for a Select Licence.
---
That‘s 112,5€ for your 100% chance. That‘s about 125,7USD. You definitely are not a game designer.
---
The timegate issue is about RETENTION, not monetization. It‘s about making the players stick around. Your idea would scare them off even faster.
---
I vomited in my lap finishing the story and sat in the dark for several hours afterwards because ArenaNet specializes in encounters where you can't see what the fuck is going on and designed to make you puke and give you a headache.  This collection is supposed to be my 'reward' for that.
---
I'm never going back to this map.
---
There are usually commanders who run it, just join and follow. Buy showels etc to get chests. It’s profitable if you follow the zerg and get all the drops and chest contents etc

Silverwastes.

So named for the rotation of defending forts (Red, Indigo, Blue, Amber).

That said, while its widely regarded as the gold source of the game, I've never gotten anywhere close to 25g/h on it. Maybe more like 5-6 tops.
---
&gt;There are usually commanders who run it, just join and follow
---
Yeah, I joined a squad, but people were scattered all over the place. I tried to follow a pack of some of them, but then they all disappeared instantly. No one was speaking or anything. 
---
&gt;Buy showels etc to get chests. It’s profitable if you follow the zerg and get all the drops and chest contents etc

Ah, useful, thanks for the tip. TBH I had no idea one could buy shovels

Honest reply, considering that MMOs and online games in general work off the principles of addiction.
---
This was implemented and the megathread was up for about 46 hours. It was removed to put the Skyscale megathread up.
---
Standard subreddit spoiler rules are still in effect.
---
Don't you know that all of the internet only exists to entertain and be relevant to one person?!
---
I can't bring myself to finish it. I've been at the final step for over a year now. I just cannot grind the Maguuma jungle.
---
Oh, yeah, speaking of Raids, remember when everyone thought we'd get another wing with this episode too?
---
The best guide (so far) !  
---
Food for thought:
---
1. It's pretty obvious to anyone (players and ANET alike) that the Skyscale is a lot harder to get than the Griffon.
---
2. Time-gating the acquisition is a pain point (sick-leaves and weekends just aren't going to cut it). And people who have a life WILL hate it (obviously ANET would be aware).
---
And ANET is still going ahead with this. Why??I'll bet there's a pretty good content-related reason (S5, S6 etc.).Or at least, there had better be.
---
Totally subjective, but I would be fine with a thing that made players wait a total of 7 days. I would also be opposed to any time gate crafting for this collection.
---
back to e621 with you!
---
After map completing every map in the game and not getting anything good with the BL keys, it pretty much convinced me never to buy them with gems, as the value you get from the chest is far less than the gem cost.
---
Yeah from the npc in the first camp. Check lfg commanders usually advertise there for RIBA or Silverwastes farm. Big blob is supposed to go in circles around the map
---
That one line of voice makes you wonder, why did he say mother? Does that mean elder dragons had a mother?? Are we going to meet something worse then elder dragons?
---
Oh you mean like the elon riverlands meta? Which has a piece for the collection locked behind it? :)  
---
Or all those living world season maps that people are gonna have to buy? \^\^
---
So far the response to criticism has been silence and removing posts and polls on gw2 forums.
---
ANet is taking cues from Blizzard I see.
---
There's an option in the settings to display item names from afar, which makes it easier to locate the eggs. Make sure it's ON.
---
Secondly, dumb question but you're sure you're exactly nearby an eggs? The map is multi-layered with tons of cliffs and all. Sometime eggs are extremely well hidden or on the ground level near the water.
---
Not even close, because for some people "their own pace" is faster than the time gate. It enforces a maximum speed, which goes against the concept of going at your own pace.
---
We wont know until the 8th day if they have another patch...
---
Calm? Why shouldn't I be calm? o.o
---
I just explained the situation. I may didn't see any sarcasm, but I answered in a neutral ways. It's not like I raged or something. 
---
I think you took my comment too serious.

[](#s "Zhaitan's magic is part of Aurene now, so Kralky doesn't have it any more. He ded.")
---
Arena net knows what they are doing. Everything is planned. The time gate is planned and ignoring the mob is planned. Game is going into content drought now with no date or content of season 5 even mentioned. With no expansion confirmed to ever come, it is their way of keeping people in game and pretens there is a lot to do, while you fly around, press 50 times and charge quartz crystals.
---
This is all their plan. Once you realise how shallow is this patch and the future after lay offs, you will find inner peace.
---
Black Lion Chests are a very common drop, and are also inexpensive to simply buy on the trading post. 
---
Chests contain a pretty wide variety of stuff, including some exclusive skins. But to open them, you need Black Lion Chest Keys, which are *far* more difficult to obtain in-game.
---
It’s designed like this to get people to buy keys  off the gem store with real money, so they can open all of the chests they acquire as they play.
---
***TLDR;*** it’s ArenaNet’s form of loot boxes, and it’s terrible.
---
Try going up and far forward by turning on action camera, pointing the way you want to go, flying up and forward as far as your blue bar will take you, and then dash even further into that direction with three dodges in quick succession (the regular two and one from the endurance boost).
---
I had okay fun on the skyscale at the start but ever since I started chaining those dodges to break out of its regular flight path I've really enjoyed it. Also, if you fly into unbound magic that'll give you back your blue bar and some endurance so that's more dashes if the map allows for it.
---
We do know the masteries from the stream. One is to mount it in mid-air like the griffon, one is to recharge some endurance when you push off after clinging to a wall, and unfortunately I've forgot the third one.
---
Yeah same, Rox is cuter.
---
The post says "while we fix it" though
---
What am I looking at
---
These achievements somehow became visible in my list.
---
They are the last objectives of the final day of the Skyscale Collection.
---
Now we have a few days to speculate about what we have to do for them...
---
My guess is that we simply have to pick up items in each area since they say 0/4 and 0/5 and we probably have to be flying on our Skyscales.
---
Note that the collection step also seems to require at least one episode of the Living World season 4.
---
I've got the display on and i was right near it, found another player who said they just picked it up
---
Hoarders like myself have been converting Crystals on daily log-in for years, whenever I capped out on farming the crystals from Drytop.
---
It finally pays off
---
?????. I understand it's limitation of the mount i clearly pointed out the flaws of it and asked if it's 25% or 50% more fuel "a.k.a" green bar, it wouldn't be an issue.
---
I thought I may have been imagining him saying that!
---
Vabbi meta is much worse, trust me.
---
I remember when playing through challenging content WAS the reward.
---
These devs didn't touch the Skyscale. They will have another stream on the 24th addressing questions about the Skyscale.
---
Should have been Roller beetle collection times 2. Thats it. Or Griffon.
---
&gt;That ought to cause at least some mayhem in the ocean depths, if not even draw unwanted attention.
---
I thought more of something like another big wave like what happened when Zhaitan raised. 
---
If we are lucky it could hit Lions Arch and flood it again.

Thanks alot for this, its helping me quite abit.
---
Edit: At least your writing is readable, unlike mine lol
---
Every time I see one of those posts about a politician trying to get loot-boxes illegal I think that that could really hurt games and then I remember how crap loot-boxes are and kinda hope it happens just to see what the replacement would be.
---
&gt;And I love the dense jungle maps, I’m not sure what you think removing the canopy in Dragonfall would do,
---
I think he means the maintainable-altitude ceiling for the Skyscales.
---
Imagine the people who fall in both of those things. They intend to do the first choice, then realize they don't care about the new mount at all, which then the second choice becomes the situation.
---
Yep. Events like this and the unrewarding boss event make me go do other entertaining things that are more rewarding. I have gotten so much homework done early now that I have no urge to play again.
---
Ok sure, but it cant be that hard for them to disable completely rewards from literally 3 maps (southsun cove, bloodstone fen and dragonfall). Even disabling the item itself would make more sense than locking the whole playerbase out of rewards. They choosed the worst possible solution to the problem they haven't fixed for 3 years now.
---
i honestly cant find that megathread, if it was removed, where did all those posts go?

Is Gorrik tied to the map events? I noticed he was MIA as well when a nearby event was live

This. From the rando free keys I've gotten I've gained fuck all. Makes me feel very secured about my decision to not actually risk buying keys.

Hmm.  I definitely have not used the dodge mechanics enough to a point where I properly understand them.  I'll give that a shot the next chance I get.  Thanks for the rundown!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpf9p9/megathread_skyscale_collections_information/
---
Yup, me too. I saved all my quartz in a shared inventory slot and turned them into charged anytime I pass by a place of power.
---
The difference is that you can do the druid stone grind at your own pace. You can do all the hearts for 4 a day, you can also spend more resources for a 5th one from the vendor at the start. Or you can just use the vendor and get 1 a day. You can make consistent progress on it however you want.
---
With the skyscale, you can go at your own pace until you hit a massive roadblock and have to wait until next reset. Imagine if your pace was to get all but 1 item on the day 1 collection, then after reset you get the last item, but then have to wait until reset for collection 2 to open up.
---
What about the fact that dropping that much land mass into the middle of the ocean should have caused massive tsunami's around the world. Now, where it is located, it would end up hitting the south side of Orr, which, from what we know of so far, is just ruins, it would also hit the scavenger's causeway, but we haven't heard anything about people living there. But my main point is, south of Dragonfall is Cantha, so maybe we accidentally decimated Kaineng City? Just a thought :P
---
I do care if it's timegated, In perspective I wouldn't care if it's a legendary armor or weapon to craft them or the daily rest crafting of specific item.
---
The only thing that they did lie about being easier to griffon. Also I did point out of it's flaws in mechanics, even with "Wall launch" itself. That been said, The mount itself isn't a great option to be hyped about, I understand the frustration of some people. 
---
I am being here to voice my own opinion and take about the mount itself along the time gated.
---
It's like hitting two birds with one stone, There for In my personal opinion if the mount mechanic skyscale itself stays as it's way not increasing fuel, a.k.a "green bar" by 25% or 50% the whole mount itself is going be useless in some Central Tyria maps. and provided and example "Queensdale". But sure It's alright to not mind anything that your own take and others and I respect that.
---
...  
---
/r/whoooosh ?
---
Sadly not, since Orr would be the buffer for Lion's Arch based on map position
---
Steve
---
Ugh I just did 2 collections in Dragonball for this. I've seen all the complaints so just wondering how many collections do you have to do in total?
---
I'm on giving skyscale medicine to sick skyscales part.
---
If you look at the water way lion arch is pretty protected from a wave, most of it would hit orr, the islands of the ring of fire and scavengers causeway , the rest of the water would maybe hit southsun cove and the grove
---
And...  
---
ANet going "La la la la CAN'T HEAR YOU" is not helping them.
---
depends on how you define exorbitant amount of gold.. but its enough to buy some legendaries straight to sell price.
---
just checked. 12k spirit shards. but honestly.. crafting the high profit items is too risky for my taste and refining mats is too time consuming. thats time i can use for reallife :D
---
What are you talking about, LA is impervious to anything now \*laughs in Claw Island\*
---
But yeah, i also thought of the possible tidal waves we sent in all directions lol
---
You're welcome! But I just realised I actually described it wrong. This will work, but ideally you'll want to dash as you're still rising. Your dash will take you in the direction you're traveling so if you use it while you're going up, you'll actually gain a bit of height.
---
To be honest I think that those achievements are not tied to the unlocking process for the skyscale. I think you get an achievement if you fly through those rifts your second mastery opens. (Like they showed at the Dev-Stream)
---
I've only been able to do one step per day (scales, then medicine) due to time constraints, but today I would have had time for a couple...but I've only got the eggs left in this step and then I have to wait for reset, but then I'm back to very limited time for the next several days. I will be delayed by days further simply because I can't use the time when I have it.
---
I do still plan to get it, eventually, but with this limping pace it's going to be a 'soon^(tm)' thing for me.
---
Yeah. People are acting like without timegates, everyone would rush through to immediately get the Skyscale, but realistically, only the most intense players would do so (at least, if the xp bar wasn't held hostage). The rest of us would probably do one or two steps each or every few days (again, if the xp bar wasn't locked). I'd personally likely do the story and map completion/vendor unlocking over the first day or two, then get the scales and maybe eggs in a day or two, then do the rest at my leisure over a week or so. I mean, heck, even without any timegating (even the charged quartz), there's so much stuff to do to get the Skyscale that even the more intense players would still be getting plenty of play time out of it. In fact, most of them might even just be getting it today or tomorrow. 
---
What's worse is that with the timegating, the xp bar lock, and everything else, we're actually more incentivized to rush through everything than go at our own pace. At the most, they could've either just had one or two reset-locked things, just had the charged quartz as a timegate, or only unlock the different collections over this first week but not require reset to access ones that have been put in (that is, someone who started today could do the scales, medicine creation, eggs, sick Skyscales, and whatever the first players have unlocked so far today without having to wait for daily reset to do the next step, just finishing the previous step and maybe a map reset). That way, they could still pad out play time for people who started immediately without making everyone else feel like they need to rush through everything, especially if they're wanting to go through it with friends.
---
&gt; what we have to do for them
---
adventures or races... isn't it like, very obvious?
---
Removing this as we already have the megathread and there is another dedicated post regarding Guild Chat.
---
No more coffee, bruh. Also, I guarantee you "everyone" is not going for that mount. I'll stick with the ones we have, thanks.
---
Does raid rezing work?
---
The tower in Shadow of the Colossus!
---
The tooltips states that we have to close 5 reality rifts with our skyscale
---
Quite a few people that post also downvote everything else in attempt to get their post higher up.
---
Soo, skyscale should be locked behind raids? I'm up for that! Bonus points if they make it somehow unsellable.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpgnpv/black_lion_keys_and_transmutation_charges/ent3kmb/
---
That's really weird. I'm sorry for insisting but what's the name of your collection called? You're sure it's the one for the egg and not the scales? 
---
When did you unlock the collection? Today? Before reset yesterday?
---
Every rezz works, downstate and dead.
---
And on top of that, Kralka didn't sound too bothered by dying and even sounded happy for Aurene. He had no reason to revive himself. (Not that he could)
---
A troubling thought indeed xD
---
It entirely depends and I'm not certain how the change it leadership may or may effect their willingness to change it.  Lots of folks complained about the cost of the Griffon, but that never changed.  Lots of people complained about the amount of HP elites required when HoT first came out and they did change that.  It's up in the air, but I don't really expect them to change it.  At best I'm hoping for a snarky comment/post from a dev on the forums telling us we shouldn't be frustrated or upset and that'll be it.
---
10/10 would trade it for Spider Pig :V
---
Ah, alright.
---
I'm in uni right now but prefer writing, so I really liked seeing this post. Whenever I suggest writing things out to my classmates its like I'm asking them to run a marathon.
---
All that matters:  Is this timegate shorter or longer than "A Henge Away from Home"?
---
&gt; And if you have questions about the skyscale mount, hang onto them just a little while because we have a deep dive Guild Chat episode about the skyscale coming up on May 24. 
---
&gt; First several (now deleted) questions are about the ridiculous time-gating on the Skyscale
---
In seriousness though, I get why they're doing this; it's important to keep things like this more focused, so you can go reasonably in-depth, over a reasonable time.  These things require more planning than is sometimes apparent, so I understand that this was likely planned well before the episode's launch, and it's difficult to pivot.  The content they *do* say they're going to cover sounds interesting, and I'd like to hear about it. 
---
That said, they need to do *something* to address players' concerns.  Make a prepared statement that you read out at the start of the stream or something; just please address it, and say something more substantial than "wait until the 24th to voice your concerns".
---
I had this experience with the skyscale as well.  I did not have your patience.  
---
I love exploring in the game, but hearing there was so much timegating with the skyscale, I decided to just use a guide to find the various locations, sick skyscales and eggs, instead of seeking them myself.  I rushed through it so I could get the eggs done before the daily reset, and I would not have done so if I there had been no time gating for it.  
---
I sort of feel like it encourages me to rush through it to get enough done for the time gating that day, and that hasn't been a positive experience for me.  I know that if I just had more patience and willpower, I could have overcome it, but with the sheer amount of timegating that was being offered here, it felt more needful than in other things.  
---
I rushed.  I lost enjoyment in the searching and exploration as a result.  This has left me with an overall negative impression of the whole thing.
---
Personally I am always lacking in spiritshards because I actually use mine. The inability to get them is really annoying
---
Anet has to respond with this much criticism
---
&gt; the high profit items is too risky

that's a *lot* of free gold you're sitting on. If you're worried about listing a legendary and it never selling, (Here's 790g just waiting in [Frostfang](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-30684)), you could always sell it directly to a buy-order for 380g. Or do a gift of mastery sell via /r/GW2Exchange
---
Well, debris landed from several hundred meters, not from Tyria's orbit to cause a devastating flood. But yeah, immediate are should get somehow affected like South Orr, Scavenger's Causeway and Dajkah.
---
We might have gotten the attention of the Largos as they could be nearby.
---
Nice handwriting
---
Since we've seen parts of Grenth' Balthazar' and Melandru's Domains in the open world now, as well as Kormir's domain in PoF, that leaves only Dwayna and Lyssa as unexplored mists zones.
---
We've still got that mirror thing from LS3 to figure out. These would be interesting things to show up in either Fractals or Raids, I think.
---
I have been thinking about the best way that ANet could handle this, and still keep the intent of the collection, and make it feel like a legendary mount while still getting access to it. 
---
1. Base Mount and Mastery Track 1 (in-air rescue I think it's called) unlocks with story complete and talking to Gorrik (you already befriended a few). 
---
2. You have to do that mastery as normal. 
---
3. The next track is locked until some level of the collection is done (say as close to 50% as possible). 
---
4. Do mastery bar and spend points as normal. 
---
5. Last mastery unlocks with full collection. 
---
At same time, fix it so you can still get spirit shards while a mastery level is locked. 
---
Allows people to at least get the base mount and feel like they are making progress, and the 'bonding with the baby' explains why you deepen the connection to your mount. You show you care about the new species' well being.
---
Is it likely they will make adjustments? Probably not. It isn't unprecedented for them to make adjustments like they did for the commander tags. However, what is more likely to happen is they will take this feedback for future mounts into consideration if the community keeps reminding anet not to apply ridiculous timegates.
---
Same deal with Chuka and Champawat; the Tiger Cubs.
---
Went and added a link to this post in the megathread, thank you for your work.
---
A nurse may be able to heal you, even if you can't.

An engineer may be able your autonomous robot, while the robot cannot fix itself.
---
So.. You buy... More chests...?
---
Yes, [the black lion chest key entry on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Chest_Key)
---
So far the only thing said with an official stance is that Skyscale Questions will only be answered on the 24th of May; no word about something sooner or something outside of Guild Chats.
---
This doesn't completely rule out the possibility of something being said outside of Guild Chats.
---
Guild Chats are scheduled a couple weeks ahead of time and they don't have the ability to swap guests around.
---
Forum Thread:

---
For those worried about the time-gates, here's some info -
---
* People discover a hoard of collections, displeasure but, "alright."
---
* Collection 1: 5 day time-gate is discovered. Everyone hates circling the map 3 times.
---
* Collection 2: Pretty smooth, actually somewhat nice.
---
* Collection 3: 3 day time-gate is discovered.
---
--&gt;  For those with plenty of Gold, 3 days apparently.
---
--&gt;  For those with little Gold and 10 Charged Quarts, 12 days or purchase food on TP.
---
--&gt;  For those with no Gold or Charged Quarts, 22 days from scratch (22 Charged Quartz.)
---
* [Unknown Beyond]
---
So we're looking at a minimum of 8 days so far for those who missed the first daily reset.
---
Unless something is said outside of Guild Chats, it's unlikely we'll see any change unfortunately.
---
In other words, you either complete the time-gates and then hear about Anet removing them or you just stop now and cross your fingers.  Myself, I'm just going to complete them anyway.
---
Let's not forget they removed the User-posted Poll on the forum that had 200+ votes, 70% for "Remove the timegates," vs. 30% "Keep them."  It isn't a culmination of all users voting, but I personally don't understand why they would remove it.
---
He chonk. Built like a turtle.
---
But that's amazing artwork
---
&gt;The only thing that they did lie about being easier to griffon.
---
Awkward sentence structure aside, this is objectively false and continuing to use it as part of your arguments only weakens the rest of them.  Being forced to wait a day to continue progress is not the same as something being more difficult.
---
Everyone being really angry about the fact they can't get a shiny new thing right away aren't they
---
I have limited time to play. Because of the timegates I need to super rush. From what I understand the collections will need events on other maps? I want to do those when they are buzzing with people.
---
Right now I am stuck on my character needing to get to a map point that can't get to. She can only try during a certain window in the meta. No one on a map I've been on has known how to get to the spot. Right now it's an annoyance in my way, making the whole process harder, rather than a fun challenge.
---
If they want the Skyscale to require every mastery and all sorts of character unlocks to date, I am totally cool with that. Make it a meta achievement like Aurora. Right now I just feel pressured and like I am going to miss windows where people are doing the events I need.
---
&gt; Now we have a few days to speculate about what we have to do for them...
---
Couldn't you just open them to have more details?...
---
All I need to know:  Is it shorter or longer than "The Wayfarer's Henge" which was 16 days?
---
Haha, if they did that this childish community would cry even harder.
---
As someone who's dropped 4-5 thousand gold on BL key it seems the loots only gotten worse over the years.  Sure I've gotten a bunch of rare stuff but nothing worth the amount I put in. Six years and I still haven't seen a single perma contract reward.
---
Look at all the people getting pissy because they can't get the thing the day it comes out.
---
These are also probably the same people that got Exordium the day it came out.
---
Just because you can't play it the way you want to doesn't make it not good. I actually appreciate how they timegated it. Gives it the appearance that this process is actually taking time instead of just granting it to you right away.
---
If you want it, work for it for once instead of just nabbing it up right away by throwing gold at it. If it's too much work for you, sorry. It's a great mount and deserves work to get. Not everything in a game should be super easy to get.
---
Me? I'm going to continue enjoying the process that is getting the Skyscale. I'm loving it. It's a great collection.
---
Good job ANET.
---
Can't help but feel his wings are like 1/3 the size they would need to be... Magic I suppose
---
You can ride them if you pick them up at the roosts, but literally nobody owns them yet.
---
Looking to make a quick gold, huh? The Order has been gathering some information about different methods so you can pick one you like. [Here is the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=how+to+make+gold&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=month)
---
If you have PoF, there is a Rich Node in the Crystal Oasis at top of [Glint's Legacy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glint%27s_Legacy). You can mine that node with multiple character a day.
---
Subtle advertising for PoF. :P
---
Who cares? I don't play those games. Why do we have to be the same as WoW, didn't we buy Guild Wars 2 on the promise of something fundamentally different? Plus fuck you too.
---
Haven't play an MMO in almost 2 years, but go on.
---
Well, day 2 was pretty labor intensive so the timegate was a good; "get off your computer now"..
---
Never I have said that players that go through with the exploit are not at fault. Every player responsible for taking advantage of an exploit should be punished accordingly, but *that still doesn't change that this exploit could be avoided with bit of testing.* Those are two separate things.
---
Let me see what dumbass comeback you have now.
---
No thanks, I’ll wait a couple months...
---
It's easier to do if you have HoT and able to go to Bitterfrost Frontier. Cause I did the World boss and all the pugs just burned him down in 2 seconds.
---
The timegates make me feel like I HAVE to rush. Like I MUST play and get this entire step done or else. If there were no timegates I'd play as much as I want/have time and get as much as I could get done and move on. 
---
So like for tonight, at reset I'll be getting on to do step 2. Going to stay on and get everything done no matter how long it takes because I know that if I don't it adds an entire extra day and I have no time tomorrow, on top of that there is already a second 3 day time gate in part 3.
---
Credit card or PayPal would be fastest and easiest. Or farm Silverwastes and sell materials.
---
Wait you wanted to play the game? We have these worksheets you need to fill out first.
---
It's like democracy: GW2 is shit.
---
But every other MMO is shittier.
---
I saw shitloads of revive icons in divinity's reach with a tag so joined them. Then there is people running in the quicksand, trying to teach the class. Events that almost never have many people were active again.
---
As neat as that would be, it doesn't really make sense. Glint was trying to kill Kralk and the egg doesn't seem to have been handed over until after Glint's death. I doubt she left her egg in her lair when she knew Kralk was coming for it; she likely had it moved to Kesho with Vlast and the Forgotten and one of them handed it to the Zepheryrites.
---
I think the voice was just meant to sound distorted by the memory crystals to keep it ambiguous, rather than being what the person sounded like normally. But seeing as Vlast is Kralk's grandson, they would probably sound pretty similar given a bit of distortion.
---
Ppl are raging so hard about this. The Griffin is way more timegated! Its so fucking expensive that its months of dailies and stuff to earn that much gold. God forbid anet makes you wait a few days. Ever crafted ascended gear? Same shit there too. Only craft 1 of certain components a day. Like jfc relax
---
Who is talking about her death? Of course it was forshadowed and well-made. We are talking that her return (not death), came way too early in the story.
---
It's ironic how different game models create communities with different mindsets.
---
DotA 2 is a pure F2P game that has paid features that are openly greedy, impossible to attain through pure grinding and are only available if you pay extra money on top of the product sold in the first place. This means you still can't do shit at your own pace. You have to buy it if you bought the first product. But if you complain about any of this, you're a crybaby.
---
GW2 is a F2P game with some expansions and not-so-greedy options because grinding your way and being a 100% F2P player is still possible with access to all content. And here the complaint is that the developers do not allow you to grind your way 24h in a single day.
---
I guess no one is right or wrong. But I do find it very funny how people royally fucked by greedy game developers see complaints as whining, and how people with an actual decent deal in front of them openly complain with seemingly no reason at all
---
If you want to focus on map completion, gathering mats and selling them while running around is a good option. Things like Iron Ore and Platinum Ore sell very well.
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/gathering/permanent-nodes
---
That link can give you an idea of what to aim for, though there are way more nodes than those, the ones in that link are just permanent ones you can hit at the same location no matter the day.
---
What work though?  There is no work involved in waiting.  They could have tied it to chak eggs for example which would have time gated it behind gameplay elements.  Instead it is anet telling me exactly how much I can progress in a day.
---
I personally don't mind the time gate. Im planning to get that mount with my gf, as we made that plan first time when we saw it. So this will be our new long term goal in game. We anyways don't have a lot of opportunities to play together cos of work, so this is great for me. I also wanted to skip griff, but yesterday i went and got it in a day so i can fly and chase all those champs after the meta. :D
---
I don't like this time gate thing, but im not in the rush, so i dont mind it... :)
---
Yeah really. Like fucking relax you'll have in less than a week. Takes months to earn the gold fir the griffon
---
* [Golden](https://i.imgur.com/eT3T0PF.png)

* [Heated Iron](https://i.imgur.com/wWbzzlw.png)
---
Adding it to the list.
---
weren't they gradually giving out all of the living story episodes just before this released? Not sure how many they gave out because i have them all unlocked already.
---
That explanation for Joko’s Lich magic is pretty cool.
---
Exactly! Totally with you on this.
---
Ah, gotcha
---
6 wings a year
---
Honestly this should have probably been called a legendary mount.
---
comparing skins to mount
---
xD
---
Are the VM tools worth 2700 gems? Or is this sale the cheapest that unlimited gathering tools with some kind of bonus get?
---
In a general sense, Anet's true problem lies in the grindiness of their horizontal model of endgame progression. 
---
Horizontal progression inherently *means less* than vertical progression as a) existing content does not become easier and b) you do not unlock access to any new content.  In a sense, with horizontal progression you do not feel as if you are progressing at all.  And that in and of itself wouldn't be the problem, but when you combine that with the grind it absolutely is.  Why?  Because why grind my life away for something that has little to no impact on how I interact with the game?  The sentiment of "Ooo, shiny" can only take things so far and when I'm spending large chunks in my life for something that does nothing else but provide a minor QoL boost and "Ooo, shiny" it starts to feel real pointless real fast.  
---
And that my friends, is why every time Anet releases new content they see a player boost for about a week before it dies down again: because after a certain point most people think to themselves "why bother?"
---
Just wanted to say that I super love the expressions of the Charr and the body language. It is adorable. It is expressive. Are there more? It's sad, but true, but it's also so cute. I love how adorable it is.
---
I really didn't need to know that. That's so pathetic it's sad.
---
&gt;Stop playing coy. The player bsse will always find and break things that a few dozen developers miss. They have never accepted that as an excuse for taking advantage of obvious exploits..
---
So the exact reason you jumped on my comment was that I was somehow defending people who take advantage of the exploit. I am not, so there is no point of your comment. You are just doubling down and changing your argument because you wouldn't want to admit you were wrong.
---
I still stand by my point that they are 100% at fault for this exploit seeing its way to the game, and consequently having to remove the map exploration rewards* from the game until they fix it. 
---
All they had to do was to check whether the character wide hour cooldown allowed someone to access a map they shouldn't be in and endlessly explore it. Its not too hard as exploring BF via TP to friend is a popular way of using it and its one of the first things many people here thought about. And even if its not too apparent for them, I can still criticize them due to their mistakes. I didn't use any insults or anything as well.
---
edit: wording
---
How many of them you actually need ?
---
not old school runescape
---
or GW1 if that counts as an mmo
---
Whatever the case, that still leaves a whole lot of people unsatisfied and by that I mean as many people as are required for this kind of an uproar. There's no denying it's bad practice and design especially considering that Guild Wars 2 seemed to promote your own pace in many aspects, while timegates absolutely do not promote that. What's a minor problem and what's not is also not yours to decide because apparently, as I said, many people seem to care enough about this "minor" problem to post everywhere and be upset this much as if it were a major problem. So while it may not be an issue for those who rush through the collections now, it might sure be one for those who do not have as much time on their hand regularly and how come timegates seem to encourage rushing more than fix it?
---
Lastly, I'll turn that point of yours around: Of course there's nothing better to do than to complain. Now that those "sad little gobshites" have completed their current collection, they've got lots of time on their hands waiting until reset.
---
It means that what is keeping you from progressing is some arbitrary timer instead of your own capabilities.
---
i do but i enjoy it more if there was substance to the discussion rather then discussing what fan-fic is gonna be made canon
---
&gt; Are the expansions worth it
---
Without a doubt.
---
What you're playing right now is less of a full game and more of the world's most generous free trial. While the content that is open to you is the entirety of the core game, you're going to start butting against the free to play restrictions really soon if you haven't already.
---
Things like no map chat and restricted private messages. Only 2 characters. Artificially tiny inventory. An extremely restricted trading post.
---
Buying an expansion removes these. And that doesn't get into the expansions themselves. The expansions add a huge amount of new content and systems. Raids, large map wide Events, about 10 to 14 hours of story each, many zones, gliding, mounts, essentially "subclasses".
---
&gt; Where can I buy then cheap
---
Right now? Official website is cheapest. If you buy PoF and then add HoT as a bundle during checkout, you can get them both for $25.
---
&gt; Other ways to support
---
There is a cash shop. 99% is pure cosmetic, and the 1% is convenience. None of the stuff sells power, and none of the convenience is stuff you can't already do, just slower.
---
The big thing, however, is that along with the expansions there are 3 entire seasons of Story DLC that released between or before expansions. These are quite swell as well, and basically required for the full experience. I believe Season 2 and Season 3 (Season 1 is not available. We have 2 3 and 4) are also currently on sale.
---
Man, time gating is lame.
---
It's funny how I've been playing WoW less and less because of timegating and now gw2 is hopping on the bandwagon.
---
Time gating a mount isnt enough to make me stop playing or anything but it should be acknowledged as being a lame and boring way around exnteding content.
---
Hope Anet does something about it, I feel like they actually care about the players unlike other companies. *cough* blizz *cough*
---
&gt;And if you have questions about the skyscale mount, hang onto them just a little while because we have a deep dive Guild Chat episode about the skyscale coming up on May 24.
---
Did... did they just time-gate asking about the Skyscale?
---
nicely done =)  
---
once ppl get their cheeves, the zerg will be more supportive of following a route  
---
it's like herding cats out there right now
---
If it takes you months to earn 200 gold you are doing something terribly wrong
---
You can get that in like a day
---
They merged it into another thread, which kept the posts but killed the poll. Totally on 'accident' I'm sure.
---
No, you don't. You really, really don't.
---
You did hit the point you
---
I have different speculation.  While I agree that there may be more time gated things (and I like time gated stuff...) I think there might be a point.
---
What if Skyscales are basically a specie from which Kralky came? They also devour magic, but maybe Kralk lineage were just an alpha unit, staying on top for millennia, becoming humongous beasts?
---
What if this conclusion is revealed at the end of achievement?
---
This means that elder dragons are actually primordial animals who were lucky enough to absorb a lot of magic (mordy is like a jungle sneak).
---
Maybe there is an another piece of story after that?
---
Or maybe not, maybe just few AP and a mount.
---
Thing is, GW2 in QoL and price aspects is great; it sucks for everything else. ESO is a way better MMO in all aspects but it's toppled by some questionable market practices. FFXIV has a subscription (like, I'm pretty sure SE at this point can sustain the damned game without subscriptions), it has paid content on top of that, but it's a vastly superior MMO in terms of content. 
---
I've said this before and I keep saying it: GW2 is the fast food of the MMO genre, cheap, not made to last, and albeit tasty it's not really made of good ingredients.
---
Those just open shortcuts; nothing special. You need the appropriate Roller Beetle Mastery to break them with the engage skill.
---
Once you own the griffon you wonder how you ever lived without it
---
But the point is that it’s supposed to be an issue. The mount isn’t supposed to be epic, not more than any other. It’s not supposed to be capable of infinite flight or a legitimate choice anywhere in the game. It’s supposed to do its thing in appropriate environments. The mount’s already considered valuable to the extent that the springer got a very significant buff this patch.
---
As the player, everyone of course has to balance if getting the mount is worth their time, but the collection, as frustrating as it is, and the mount are distinct.
---
With the data on the wiki you would get an average of 1 charged quartz per 2 stacks of gifts
---
So how much is actually timegated? And how long would it take to finish all the collections to get the new mount?
---
I’ve been looking everywhere but honestly it’s just confused me even more trying to find an answer.... I haven’t played much since the end of PoF and getting the griffon but obviously tempted back by the prospect of a new mount, just depends how much time I’ll have to wait around and the effort/gold needed to finish it all as to whether I’d want to come back for it.
---
Thank you. It's not even a month. I'm not a really big fan of the practice either but this happens in every part of the game. You'd think people would have gotten the message until now.
---
Hey look, another guy who missed the point entirely
---
Where is the lack of substance? Having a dragon and land mass fall out of the air into the ocean is the exact kind of inciting incident that will likely initiate the next story chapter.
---
But ... idk, isn't this like having a personal tamagochi? A warning would have been nice, but is it that terrible of a design?
---
Queen's guantlet was far, far from challenging tho. If it was actually hard, people would complain as well.
---
Yeah selling the grow lamps as a whole...  not the charged quartz
---
Tonight my friend.  Tonight.
---
I propose last Skyscale collection to consists of 5 items:
---
1. Very rare drop from Dhuum CM and Qadim CM
---
1. You get from reaching 10k rank in WvW
---
1. You get from collecting all monthly AT gizmos
---
1. Reward for reaching 40k AP
---
1. Very rare drop in hardest content in Guild Wars 1 (Appears after in GW2 via linked account)
---
Thank you! \^\^ And sadly, I don't really have other comics like this, I only do this kind of stuff once or twice in every second year when the Anet pissed me off with something haha.
---
Expansions have never existed for Dota 2 ever. What you might be talking about are seasonal events which aren't usually hidden behind a paywall and also not an integral part of the game as they're more or less some sort of a mini-game. You're comparing apples and oranges.
---
Idk why people keep saying and making guides and what not RIBA 25-30 g per hour. I call BS on that, I can't get past 7 gold when I am lucky usually it goes from 4 - 6 .
---
osrs &gt; gw2 for sure
---
This. So many times this.  
---
I liked the first part of the first collection. It was fun. Then I had to find 14 sick skyscales.... Ok, I ran past some while looking for the scales so not that big of deal, but kinda tiresome. After that, I discover I have to search for 21 eggs... They are hard to find, even with the object names always on. It was fun at first, but then people discover you gotta wait a reset to get to the next part. So, I feel somewhat "rushed" to finish the collection so I can unlock the next part as soon as possible.
---
The second collection was fun, but when you have to talk to npcs to be able to SEE what you will gonna need, was bad design. I went back and forth to the same map 5 times or more... I know I could have unlocked ALL before starting the "next" part of each, but still, bad design. (Today I will unlock the third skyscale collection, btw)  
---
And then, when I finally get my skyscale in a few days, I will need mastery xp... And while doing the collection I am getting so much of it! I am not complaining the mastery xp feels wasted, but that after I get the skyscale I won't have the "discovery" fun to get the mastery xp, since I am almost finished with the map achievs (blame me for liking the map xD).
---
best $11 you'll ever spend
---
hey ok
---
not really. to me it seems more like they came up with a cool map concept that got put in the ocean because where else were they gonna put it? if it was you'd think they would at least hint at something
---
Who let you speak for everyone else and when they need the mount? Just stop already. The mount was one of the main features of the new episode and people do not like the artificial timegates on one of the main features they have waited so long. Its only fair.
---
As for the 'LiFe DoESnT woRK tHAt wAY', its game reward design, not life. I don't need schooling from you when I am criticizing the reward system. 
---
Also they had a rather good collection method for Beetle, they could have used something similar to that easily.
---
So someone in my map was lucky enough to get the [Gift of Aurene](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Aurene_(container) container to drop, and I just wanted to share the weapon they linked because it's absolutely beautiful. Apparently you can select any stat from any expac you want on it as well.
---
That's day 2
---
I'd recommend RIBA runs. Usually nets me 30-40g per hour. Some people get way more with characters built for farming it.
---
In camp 2 also. I have a griffon already, so... whatever lol.
---
The skyscale is time gated?
---
Dungeon tour, fractal dailies, reset raids, RIBA
---
1. the EDs don't act the way they do towards us out of malice but out of indifference, more over glint was a serious threat towards him and i think the ED at the very least have a self preservation instinct.
---
2. we'll see, the whole aurene being an ED is kinda unexplained, we just know she's a ED now.
---
3 see 1
---
4 what the hell are you talking about? afaik the dwarves and the forgotten never came into conflict
---
Moooom they made content and forcing me to play, moooom ! Have a downvote.
---
Replace her with Trahearne
---
I've been griping about this for years. I'd really love to have a sink, not counting the worthless gobbler, for all the eyes of kormir, fossilized leaves, bladed thorns, whatever else shit drops constantly and has a 5 copper backlog on the TP in the hundred thousands. But instead we get things like sigils with extremely limited crafting recipes (none at the time the recipe went live), and the same five to ten already overpriced materials that every other recipe already calls for.
---
what answer are you expecting in the sub dedicated to the game?
---
You can get 250 gold in like 2 days of RIBA farming if you really wanted it.. what months???
---
Ngl, never seen this
---
The egg hunt afaik is part of newborn skyscale, so there shouldn't be any timegate until you're done with this step... Afterward you'll be tasked to go to Sun's Refuge to start the 2nd step (Saving Skyscale).
---
Here are a few alternatives you might try:
---
1- Rush the War Eternal story with an alt so it can also get access to the scavenger hunt and see if the bug persist. 
---
2- Deactivate "replay chapter" mode (if you were in chapter replay), maybe the feature is conflicted with the post-story state of the skyscale scavenger hunt
---
3- Wait until today's reset, it might fixes itself
---
If nothing works, it might be time to contact support with screenshot evidences that indeed, the eggs are not there.
---
&gt; You need to finish all the season 4 content before you can start the Skyscale 
---
Wait what?
---
If you haven't finished the other episodes it won't let you start?
---
1: Glint was trying to kill him.  He defended himself.  [Spoiler](#s "He also said to Aurene at the end that he hoped she'd never have to kill someone she loved, implying that killing Glint wasn't easy for him.")
---
2: [Spoiler](#s "He also said that Aurene wasn't like him, that she was the first of something new.")
---
3: We don't know.  We can't ask a couple of them right now.
---
4: I'm not sure where you're getting that the dwarves fought the Forgotten?  So far as I'm aware they were both aligned in the service of Glint.  The only race they actively warred against were the Margonites.
---
people complain about the timegate, not the collection
---
Generally speaking it's expected that you play games the way the game way designed to be played.
---
You are correct! I just wanted to write it all out to be sure I didn't miss anything
---
Because you dont have to get everything instantly when logging in? Because why not? Just be glad it isnt more and stop the whining?
---
Scale 10's links are broken and aren't marked.

I don't think they meant to say that kralk absorbing other dragon's magic was the "only" reason he was bad and did what he did.
---
It was one of the reasons.
---
Having said that even during the entire season, specifically last 3 episodes doesn't Aurene keep saying "she is not him"? 
---
He was bad, there is a possibility that too much power may corrupt her as well, but it is not a rule written in stone that it will be the case.
---
i also dont mind the timegate.
---
I would normaly rush the content and feel burnt out afterwards. with this timegate its like "ive done my job for today and can rest now".
---
i think its great, and also it adds a sense of time passing, just like you described
---
Unsure if I should be spending my motes on the armor or if I should be saving them for the Skyscale.
---
Tot bag and wintersday bags skyrocket!!!
---
Totally agree, I can (under)stand a bit of timegating, but this is way too much. Even aurora was a bit over the top but at least that was for a legendary
---
Nope, then it says locked...
---
RS Classic is better than OSRS.
---
change my mind
---
Nope, only fed it the 3 possible times today.
---
I play Guardian a lot. I think it's a really fun class, but for PvE it's a DPS role. It's only meta as a healer in PvP. If you want to play healer/support in PvE I would go Ranger, which is also a pretty fun class. Keep in mind you're still pretty limited with the tools a class provides at level 20 so just because you find Mesmer boring now doesn't mean it will be the same when you're at max level.
---
&gt;achievements that utelize the huge amount of dragon content we have in the game. Maybe killing Shatterer, Claw and Teq for one stage, gathering a certain amount of Wild Magic etc etc. 
---
Heck no. The content and objectives of the collections aren't really a problem, just the timegate.
---
Oh, but we do.
---
i can't
---
i won't
---
Just dailies in fractals? I'm still on t1 and it isnt much.
---
That's a point, but the majority of the grinding just happened to fall on one of my few and far between days off, and I would have really enjoyed being able to keep working on my collections instead of having to put so much off until next week. And in the meantime, I'd really like to have my mastery tracks unlocked so I can keep getting XP/shards for all the work I'm putting in.
---
this a joke right? right?
---
that's your problem
---
I'd love to have something in game that requires everything in this list.
---
thats not your fault, its been like this since tuesday, just wait for a fix from anet :)
---
The new map has a fun meta, though, with good rewards. So while the story portion of the episode might be short, I think the map itself will have a long life.
---
you can earn at most 12 of those a day and you only need 300 per full set of armor. A far cry from 6 months.
---
me, when i saw the name of this chieve
---
At first I was thinking maybe people were just disgruntled. But now I'm starting to wonder if none of you have ever encountered a timegate before in any other game.
---
seems like you didnt play new map then, it's one of the most rewarding metas currently. even then, features like mount shouldnt be timegated for the sake of a map having ppl in it. do you think these ppl would play that map anyway? no they just show up to collect the eggs, scales and go away if they dont like the map.
---
better community, better shitposters, better theorycrafters, better wiki, better dev communication, the list goes on and on
---
if you don't have endless tools yet, it's worth picking up simply because they're cheap endless tools. the bonus magic gathered is negligible, the next LW season will probably use a different type of 'magic' (3 was unbound magic, 4 was volatile magic). i'm still sitting with my endless unbound tools from the start of LW3, they were my first and only endless tools. if you already have endless tools i wouldn't buy this.
---
“We ‘ve got this !!!!!”
---
There's a fundamental problem you seem to be ignoring: The very nature of the games.
---
Dota 2 is primarily a PvP game. I mean, there's all kinds of weird people, but the primary goal of the game is to be a PvP experience, first and foremost.   
---
GW2 is primarily a PvE game. And before the die hard PvP crowd says it: yes it is, don't lie to yourself. PvP exists, but that's not the core of the game. Just look at how the game launched and at every single update since release - PvP is secondary.   
---
I reckon it's been a while since I looked at it, but last I checked Dota 2's financial model, as predatory and shitty as it can be, never gets in the way of people playing the main thing they signed up for - PvP Dota. If all you want is to play games of Dota 2 there is absolutely 0 difference between someone who spends nothing at all, and someone who has bought every single item ever. I mean, in that sense Dota 2 is actually one of the best of its kind,you don't even have to buy characters last I checked, so everything you buy is cosmetics. 
---
GW2's financial model, on the other hand, does. Even ignoring expansions - that's a whole different can of worms, but for the sake of this argument let's say that's perfectly legit, the game tells you "hey, you can play dress up....no wait, here's all of these things you CAN'T, unless you pay money for!", "oh, hey, here's this bit of content to get the thing you wan-...WAIT, HOLD UP, YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT. SIT DOWN AND WAIT!"  
---
And, at the end of the day, that's all that matters. If I just want to play Dota 2 I can ignore all the cosmetic garbage and it doesn't affect my game. The same is not true for GW2. Their financial system and their horrible design decisions, which exist solely to satisfy that system, keep getting into your face.   
---
I used to love GW2. I stopped playing long ago because of a variety of issues, but the biggest one was probably the combination of grindy laundry list garbage quests and timegating. And make no mistake, timegating is 100% consumer unfriendly exploitative shit. It's about stretching out content for \*them\*, not for you. Here's a simple task: carry this box of 100 apples just 20 meters over there. Simple right? Takes what, 10 seconds? HOLD UP! You can only carry one apple a day. BOOM: "2400 hours of content!".
---
Next current events: dealing with a buncha pissed off canthans x'D
---
20 meters is 21.87 yards
---
I haven't gotten to the newest episode yet, no. I just remember all the bitching here on Reddit about LW maps mostly being quickly consumed and rendered useless.
---
yeah, if you go to a specific game subreddit don't ask "is this good?/should i buy this?", come with specific questions instead
---
&gt; ESO is a way better MMO in all aspects 
---
Combat system disagrees *slightly*.
---
&gt;FFXIV [...] vastly superior MMO in terms of content
---
2.5 seconds global cooldown by the way.
---
Yes, but basically all of these features have no impact on the main game, except maybe some shiny effects for your character or map. It's not like buying a battle pass for $10 gives you an advantage in the actual game. No one is forcing you to buy the items, you don't *need* to buy anything to play the main game the same as everyone else.
---
the last arc didnt do the tick for me either... same problem
---
The battlepass is a primarily cosmetic "expansion", its less of a content update and more of a cosmetic series.   IE it would be somewhat in the same vicinity to the cosmetic shop from GW2, which I would argue would be just as difficult to grind for everything as it would be for you to do so in GW2.
---
Though I would probably pick a better game to compare to period, because we are comparing a MMO to a MOBA.  In DotA 2 you simply have access to all content the day it comes out.  If you really want to compare to DotA 2 we need to compare timegaiting actual content, so say for example it would be like if DotA locked a new hero for players untill they played 3 games every day for 3 weeks.
---
Question: Are you opening the bags on an appropriately levelled character?
---
Because if you're opening them on a level 80, Yeah, probably going to cap at 10g at the absolute most.
---
The wiki says these can drop from Mistborn Coffers. I'm not sure if that means ANY Mistborn Coffer or just the ones that appear after the meta.
---
Yes, I agree. We should get everything right away. Without all these annoying things to do.
---
you can just use wardrobe to preview all of them.
---
It was the first time around, but this was before the fan base was spoiled by having things handed to them
---
&gt; Gives it the appearance that this process is actually taking time instead of just granting it to you right away.
---
The appearance of taking time?  It's actually taking time.  No one is sitting there doing nothing after doing the collection for the day and thinking, "Wow, look at all this progress I'm making currently."  The only people this process hurts is people who have the time to do it at their own pace (if that pace happens to be faster than what they're currently allowing).
---
&gt; If you want it, work for it for once instead of just nabbing it up right away by throwing gold at it. If it's too much work for you, sorry. It's a great mount and deserves work to get. Not everything in a game should be super easy to get.
---
Again, how is sitting around doing nothing and waiting "work"?  How is that a challenge?  Those are the complete opposites of working or being challenged.
---
All the butthurt could have been avoided if they simply advertised the mount as "legendary mount". But no, "get hype for a new mount guise teehee!" and "don't worry guys, griffon is still the prestige mount!".
---
&gt;other MMOs have steeper timegating when it comes to maxing out gear
---
Point is that in most vertical progression MMOs maxing out gear is the content and endgame at the same time. And it's not only timegated, but also requires heavy grind.
---
PSA: Charged Crystals are account bound, and charging them is timegated.
---
Thank you so much!
---
&gt;  The problem is the fucking charged quartz crystals.
---
Well, that's your own fault. Just don't be lazy and you could have more then enough on hand already. Even dumber to complain about the quartz then complaining about the wait for reset thing.
---
Looks like the regular ascended skins to me, reminds me of the Wupwup ones
---
So, if they make new content challenging to prevent people from consuming it overnight and drop from the game, they get negative feedback (see HoT's initial outrage and other casuals' whining about difficulty of something).
---
So they make content "press X to win"-easy, and put timegates instead, to keep their online numbers - they still get outrage.
---
So what exactly should they do? I suppose, just put it to gemshop - that will make everybody happy, at last. ))
---
Time-gating has nothing to do with difficulty.
---
I've got a L51 or L52 opener alt and that's been about right for me too, unfortunately. 
---
I've read guides and gotten as close as I can to matching their advice but I just don't ever see the numbers some people are throwing around.
---
I must be missing something, but idk what that something is.
---
&gt;  It has you return to the same general areas for Scales, Medicine &amp; Eggs
---
People keep forgetting the "sick" skyscales you need to mend as well.
---
They appear to be correctly categorised now. The way things generally work is when they first appear in the api they get added to the site in a "Uncategorised" section, and then every so often when I have time I go through and categorised them and add any missing acquisition methods. But that would mean that by "the other day" you mean when Thunderhead Peak was released, so unsure if something else was up.
---
There are two types of people in GW2, 
---
* People who get upset by time-gated content. 
---
And,
---
* People who are patient.
---
I know the guy who price spiked these. Tbh, I’m all for free-market type shit. But this guy is actually a total jerk over comms as a person. So don’t feed his wallet plz.
---
I loved doing it, had to travel around a map, doing some hearts and jumping puzzles, some lore.   
---
This skyscale collection, tho, is just a horrible design. It's not even a legendary.
---
Super simple.
---
Place an additional POI way off the map in bloodstone fen.
---
No one can complete it until the tp to friend is fixed to only work for  level 80s.
---
I do want to try chrono too bad I dont have HoT
---
Should have called it "my 10cent"
---
Probably not going to bother. The rest of the material isn't fun or engaging in the slightest to me, aside from hatching the eggs, which was well designed imo. I gave up the moment I heard about the timegates within the timegates (the hatchlings themselves).
---
Tbh I'm not. Does it really make that much difference though ? 
---
I mean going from 6g to 26g is quite a steep increase. Going to have to try it over the weekend for sure.
---
if the mob gives exp, it counts, if not, not.
---
No, the Unbreakable Gathering Tools is the cheapest at 2,400 gems, but the Volatile Magic Tools come with a free glyph on each of the tools (glyphs that are worth 580 gold each currently, the tools would save you well over 1,500 gold from the glyphs alone even if you don't slot them in).
---
As for something like the Path of Fire Preparation Pack for 3,500 gems you get the standard 2,400 permanent gathering tool set I mentioned in addition to a lot of other high-priced gem store goods like character slot expansion, 2 bag slot expansions, 10 black lion chest keys, and an additional 80 boost.
---
But for the "cheapest" set of permanent tools you'd have to use the Black Lion Statuettes and get the Bug tools at 45 statues each (Firefly Mining tool, Swarm Logging tool, and the Butterfly Harvesting tool), or mix and match from the Bug tools from the statues and gem store ones.
---
They're adding in time gates now?
---
Holy shit glad I dropped this game.
---
Fully expect to get downvoted by the same sycophants that downvoted this.
---
This isn't wow, stop expecting everything on a silver plate...
---
Haven’t played this game in a while. I always come back for the new story stuff and new mounts even when the game isn’t really holding my interest. First time ever that I haven’t been logging on and eagerly completing the new content, because I know I’m not dedicated enough to actually GET the thing that I want. I was looking forward to having a reason to play this game again but that’s gone.
---
They've even time gated the questions about time gating!
---
&gt; I guarantee you "everyone" is not going for that mount.
---
Yeh... "everyone" doesn't always mean "really everyone". It's used as a phrase when you talk about a big amount of people without knowing the actual number. Just like I did in my comment. 
---
But this should be common knowledge... except you intentionally searched for a reason to be offended.
---
&gt; 2.5 seconds global cooldown by the way.
---
Which has nothing to do with the content FFXIV provides. Whether or not you like the combat mechanics are irrelevant to the fact that the game has a ton of content.
---
Ah fair. Power Mesmer will still get you a decent set up. You'll miss on some traits and utility abilities that up your DPS, but you can see go Sw/Sw with Phantasmal Defender and Phantasmal Disenchanter. Those 2 + #5 on sword and #2 on sword give pretty solid dps.
---
Here is a decent regular power Mesmer build designed for fractals: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mesmer_-_Power_DPS. It's only 3/5, because it definitely is weaker compared to the chrono option, but whatcha gonna do.
---
imo this is the worse part of the time-gating of the process.
---
It easily triples It, yes.
---
I feel like the 25 to 30 I see thrown around is overly optimistic, but if you follow the commander and tag every event, and do the chest run after and open all the chests you can, it easily breaks 20
---
I would not have downvoted you, except that you preemptively bitched about downvoting. 
---
I do have to ask, why are you still reading the sub if you've stopped playing?
---
Nice shitpost riding the hate train
---
Huh, looks like they toyed with the idea that Aurene branded one side of his face as a permanent scar there at some point. Would have been a neat aesthetic, even if it was only for an episode.
---
Which part
---
Wrong. It affects even people who never intend to get the Skyscale. How ? Because the mastery is locked but not hidden. So if you choose to not get the skyscale , you will NEVER earn xp for spirit shards again in PoF or LWS4.
---
I'm looking to gear for power chrono dps for fractals but I'm confused on what gear to make.  [https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/)  uses mostly berserker with a few assassin while  [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Chronomancer\_-\_Power\_DPS](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Chronomancer_-_Power_DPS)  uses almopst all assassin pieces. Is snowcrows more reliable?
---
&gt; The skyscale, on the other hand, will be the mount you want while down world completion.
---
It won't, not even close, especially with how annoying it is to descend on it.
---
That comma should be a Semicolon ;
---
I'm gonna say it, collections are shit.
---
Here's a shopping list of billion things you gotta collect, oh and each thing has its own collection. Now go get it, isn't this fun?
---
I've been playing since beta and I'm honestly done with this repetitive "content".
---
I don't know, people are having a hard time accepting that it's there.
---
Both if you want to go damage, GS is your best range dps choice and S/S is max melee damage.
---
Would not use Shield or Focus in open world so just use both S/S &amp; GS!
---
IIRC the original list didn't include any exotic gear, and then exotic skins and other things have been being added in batches like this over time.
---
&gt;2.5 seconds global cooldown by the way.
---
What... relevance does that have to the mention of content in the game? Ignoring the fact that it's rather disingenuous to imply that it's 2.5 seconds between each and every action.
---
Right? It's basically like the Mawdrey crafting/collections, except all on one release rather than spread out over the entire season. It is WAY less painful than most gen1 legendary collections, especially for people who don't have hundreds of dollars to spend for thousands of gold.
---
That's  even worse , cause now their shitty design affects you even though you never want to get the skyscale. How ? Because the mastery is locked but not hidden , meaning you will now NEVER earn xp for spirit shards in pof or lws4 again.
---
quick question for the writers: if mordremoth can attack the mother tree in the grove, he can time gate anything
---
Thanks. 
---
Is this recommended over Condi Mirage because of the ramp up time?
---
Can it be done without mounts?  Was considering trying it on a f2p account for obsidian shards but if it all goes too fast I might pass.
---
Some people may enjoy the slower and more structured pace of combat in FFXIV, it also helps when designing encounters, dungeons and other stuff due to it.
---
Other really do enjoy the chaotic and fast paced combat that GW2 offers, which values player skill and quick thinking a bit more.  
---
While the 2.5 GCD doesn't affect the amount of content in FFXIV, it certainly changes how you go through it all which i think is the point the other user is trying to make.
---
Bubbles!
---
Sometimes I think there are bots that downvote everything automatically.  I've seen new posts that I know are ~20 seconds old already have a downvote.  I've seen this happen on the ESO sub too.
---
The combat system in eso is fucking horrible though good grief.
---
Anet storytelling?
---
i was hoping there'd be an achieve that gives an item like the ley-matter converter from dragon's stand, that lets you pick 1 trade cache key or 1 mistborn key per day like how you can get free machetes from the ley converter, since the mistborn keys are basically just pof machetes
---
She already woke up from that coma already. However, there was gossip dialogue that she had brain injuries, but that's no excuse not to see her again or have her recover already like Logan did.
---
We haven't heard from her since Heart of Thorns. THAT WAS LITERAL YEARS AND TWO LIVING WORLD SEASONS AGO!
---
We are well past the point where her voice actor should be changed. Seriously... I like Felicia Day, but as a GW2 fan, I'd rather have a more consistent voice actor voicing a beloved character.
---
This.
---
If you enjoy the game good for you, but at this point it just feels like you're achieving nothing.
---
I mean.. gw2 is pretty fucking grindy..
---
There has to be another one when he sees the timegate and then the day2 set, and another timegate
---
To see if it's worth returning.
---
And you can't be that dumb to think that there are people who can actually believe this...
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
5-6 gold isn't incentive vs an amal gem ? Well since amal gems can bought for 1.5 gold they aren't "hard to obtain" as you said. It comes down to speed. That 5-6 gold would buy you 4 amal gems. What it really comes down to is the gem + all the other rewards vs. all the DF meta rewards. There is nothing inherently special about the amal gem.
---
Same thing, just finished the scales, don't really want to continue. I think I'll just go about my business and work on the collection from time to time when I don't have anything else to do.
---
Frankly speaking those islands come straight from the mists.
---
We don't even know if they actually have real mass.
---
In fact, there is so much magic in these small pieces of land that some pieces of rocks literally float.
---
That said, dropping an almost dead giant piece of magic in the middle of the territory of the oldest Elder Dragon is just....
---
It's kinda like the tequatl weapons
---
They could put it literally everywhere. Just a bit to more east and the map would be on land. There is no reason to drop it into water, if it's not important for the story.
---
And it would fit to the GW2 story very well, because from begin on, future events were caused by previous events. Shaking the ocean with an Elder Dragon and tons of land *and* siphon off ley lines underneath is a big think. Too big, to ignore it. 
---
If we look at the past, things like these were always important for the futur story. They never ignored such things, only to make a cool map or whatever. And like I said, they could have dropped the map everywhere
---
What? I didn't say anything weir—
---
Oh.
---
Oooh.
---
Fair enough.  
---
I'll give you that.  I'm definitely still playing HoT maps, but mostly ignore PoF.
---
You still have not mentioned a single justification for the timegate lmfao. Seems like pretty much all you're doing is saying "I don't care about this so you shouldn't either"
---
Keep in mind that Reddit does not represent the GW2 player base as a whole. Sure, people here are vowing to never get the Skyscale (which I do not believe they’ll follow through with), but largely, even while grumbling, players are completing and enjoying the process. Most max level players will have it and talk about how great it is in map chat by the time the next season starts.
---
Exactly, havent finished the first collection yet and am already fedup with the map cuz it's frustrating to get around wothout that damn mount, doable, but so frustrating
---
The combat system is also extremely clunky with the stupid 3 second server ticks and getting hit by aoes you are way out of, but still hurt you because you were standing there 2 seconds ago. And leveling as a healer sucks. The hours of boring content between arr and hw. The same dungeon formular of 3 bosses + trash being copy pasted over and over again. The lack of a wardrobe system. The fact that you class is basically unplayable until level 70. Gear grinding. Meaningless open world content. F.A.T.E.s. the writing that pretends to be from the 18th century. The fact that Eureka is just an excuse to grind monsters, so you can feel the soul sucking anguish of playing final fantasy 11 all over again.
---
It's not all bad. It has some of the consistently highest production value on its fights. It's a beautiful game. But it has its flaws, and a lot of people prefer gw2 gameplay to it.
---
Ew you have to get exp?
---
I'm glad that you pointed this out, even as it's getting threatened to be drowned out by people angry about collections. Dropping several new landmasses on top of a three pronged leyline hub in the open ocean definitely is much more than the sharp prod Scarlet Briar's megadrill did to jolt Mordremoth awake.
---
Pretty sure soon we're gonna get meet the rest of the Karka that had let fled from the ocean, with other fun critters in pursuit.
---
I really want anet to really nerf how to get the mount 
---
It's not fun at all and it's even more annoying to get than the other mounts.
---
That wont actually bother me at all. I have thousands of the bloody things from WvW levels, and not the slightest clue what to do with them.
---
if only there were dozens of other ways i could procure these items....
---
It's a huge oversight and I thought they learned that lesson with the Roller Beetle but here we are again.
---
Ah, someone else who doesn't mind this. *There are dozens of us!*
---
I really hope they never do this again, but I've long made peace with how none of us really play an MMO for top-tier game design. We play for the social aspect and everything else is secondary, close secondaries but still secondary and prone to being sacrificed for profit.
---
I used your guide on my phone and had no trouble! My PC is a pain to alt tab on and I don’t have a second screen at the moment.
---
It's raining men!
---
It would be a waste to set the most powerful non dragon "free" villain as just a raid boss.
---
No, Anet not giving a fuck makes it like that. 1 raid wing per year, no balance changes towards wvw and lack of devs in pvp team makes that.
---
Thats kinda how I feel. It's not the difficulty, its not the expesnse, its not the time gating, its not even how long it takes.
---
It just feels shitty/grindy/boring to do and mount itself feels like a crappier griffon.
---
I also find the graphics to be dissapointing, it looks like a Griffon skin that you can buy from the gem store, pretty much minimal effort into actually making it's model and animations unique.
---
So a Meh mount with a long, expensive and boring unlock process.... yeah just kinda sucks all around.
---
After you have all the masteries done for a particular "region" , your xp bar reappears. Every time it fills ( which is easy ) , you get a spirit shard. Since Skyscale is Locked but not Hidden, if someone chooses not to unlock acquire it, that mastery will sit there, blocking them from ever doing that. In contrast , before you get the Griffon , the mastery is locked. Same with the Raid mastery in HOT.
---
This has to be one of the most useless comments in this whole thread tbh. Equating not wanting something to be timegated to wanting something for free... what stupidity.
---
Netherwings would be a more fitting comparison.
---
Standard ascended model but new skin. New unique colors and the rainbow glow/sparkle effect when wielded.
---
Its because this time, the "dissenting opinion" is wrong. Theres no argument for timegating other than player retention, which doesnt work and is actually doing the opposite, and that it makes it feel more realistic because its over a longer period of time, which also is a very weak argument because no one cares and theres things that are waaay more immersion breaking that are never complained about. 
---
Its just a bunch of people saying : Yeah but I dont mind!
---
Well so what? You dont care, then you dont matter in this discussion, if you have an argument thats fine but most dont at all, they just state their opinion and leave and expect to be considered as if they contribute. 
---
I dont downvote anything that comes close to having an argument, I just dont see any of these types of comments from people who dont mind the timegating.
---
It could be that the island does have some sort of magical resonance from the mists, as it seems they belonged to some of the realms of the Six. I see your point :o
---
Hmm. I'm sorry you feel that way. Personally, I actually really enjoy the game; I don't think it's shit in the least.
---
I've been timegated by forum mods for less.
---
i mean we just had dhuum in the underworld and there's enough available threads new and old for the mission story to pursue that we can have menzies for a good raid.
---
You can buy the items to make ascended armor... it is absolutely NOT the same thing lmao. And the griffon is not timegated, I got it in a few hours after starting the collection last year.
---
Did you read the post? they said they're level 20 and haven't bought either expansions yet...
---
Hmm , I didn't even recall that wvw levels give them . Shows how closely I watch the reward window for wvw level up haha. Anyway , they can basically be turned directly into gold via the mystic forge.
---
Ah okay. So higher tiers have much better rewards? Or do you sell stuff too?
---
Thats exactly what they did with his Right eye. (The one we damaged in episode 5)
---
What justification? It's their game model. That's why you shouldn't complain in the first place. It's been here for so long right now. They could've forced people to grind for hundreds of hours of actual in-game playing and killing stuff to get the Skyscale. This would amount to maybe 2 weeks of hard grinding (10+ hours per day) or months of casual grinding (3- hours per day).
---
In GW2 they introduced the concept of the time gate. This way they balance the grind-to-win parameter where you have to grind for less hours in-game but for a minimum of days in real life. This keeps economy controlled and makes the game friendlier to most of the community
---
It's not "I don't care about this". There are countless games there that are grind-to-win, with streamers playing 10h+ per day doing repetitive stuff to get to the endgame content.
---
How does gathering node reset work? (Specifically Quartz) Do they respawn on a timer or something?
---
&gt; Wrong.
---
WrOnG. What you wrote has nothing to do with my comment...
---
I never said something about "anything affects anybody", I have no idea where you read this. 
---
However, your statement even *confirms* my argumentation. I said that many people will get the Skyscale, even though they complaining about timegates. And that there will be way more than only a few people with the Skyscale, to buy a mount skin.
---
Now *you* say, that people have to get the Skyscale to get lvl-up spirit shards from PoF/LS4 again. Which means even *more* people will get the mount, even if they only want to get lvl-up spirit shards again and not the mount. 
---
And *that* is another reason why I'm right. 
---
Keep in mind that the topic is about the amount of players who will have the mount, if they bring a skin into the shop. It's *not* about how any group of players are affected by any masteries. Btw, the issue you talked about is just the same as any other PoF and LS4 mastery, including the Rollerbeetle and all PoF mounts (except griffon). But like I said, that's not the topic here.
---
The ascended crafting time gate doesn't bother me as much because you can get them as drops in certain content and you don't *absolutely* need ascended gear to do most content. But it is annoying I do admit that lol.
---
The issue is really that they are not producing content fast enough and not producing enough good repetitive content. Therefore they take shortcuts like putting egregious timegates in to force players to stay in the game.
---
They also didn't make it clear in the advertizing that Exordium wouldn't be easy to get.
---
Missed opportunity to just go "IT'S MA'AM"
---
I am disappointed, as a fellow ma'am.
---
Just so you know there's a Tonic that turns you in to a baby Skyscale you could spend those motes on!
---
GW2 has had timegates for years so clearly you are wrong.
---
More like, "I can't get this in the first M.O.N.T.H".
---
I would be totally okay with that if they actually just told us that they needed a few days/weeks to get all maps ready for the Skyscale. Anet's been a relatively transparent company, especially recently, and they've earned enough good will to afford to take some extra time to polish everything, especially with how good the rest of the release has been and how much there is to the collection, timegates aside. The thing is, not only haven't they done that, they also have each step timegated, which doesn't make sense if they just need more time. Say a week or so from now they have the maps fully Skyscale-ready and all the bugs taken care of, and I want to start working on getting the Skyscale. Unless they change it, I still have to wait a day after each step, well after the reason for the timegating has been fixed. Ideally, they'd just unlock access to the next step for everyone each day (that is, if you started today or whenever, you can complete the scale finding and medicine creation collections and then, once they're done, go onto the next step without having to wait until reset, and so on until you reach the step that people that started prereset on Tuesday and did each step daily are at).
---
I really want to give Anet the benefit of the doubt and say you're right, but even if that was the case, it's still being extremely poorly handled.
---
Yes. Focus can be nice for aoe pull and burst along with gs since offhand sword is single target mostly.
---
The issue with the time gate is it's not being done for us - the players benefit. It's being done for INVESTORS. More players logging in, more player engagement, happier investors.
---
Keep that shit out of video game design.
---
I'm sorry sir

As someone who fashion wars the shit out of this game, I dont mind the transmutation charges
---
In instanced PvE Content Chronomancer has ramp up time too since you can't precast anything (besides Staff Chaos Field) and your Mesmer Phantasms have a casttime. Unlike Elementalists who can precast their Meteor Shower or Lighning Storm; unlike Dragonhunter who can prestack their Traps inside Bosses Chronomancer (all Mesmer) have no upfront Burst on Bosses since their Toolkit does not offer any Skills for this purpose.
---
Chronomancer have strong self buffing capabilities tho since you get lots of Alacrity and Quickness on Shatter etc. also Might and Fury through your Phantasms etc. wich increases your dps by quite a bit in Groups that lack those Buffs.
---
They fall of tho if your Group actually keeps up decent Uptime on those Boons.
---
So yeah power Chronos are a good choice if you want an easier time dealing damage, compared to Mirage you will clearly have stronger Burstphases and Mirages are usually belittled in PvE outside of certain Raidbosses where they're Meta because of their specific condition damage distribution. If your Target is using skills and is actively moving around, Mirages will have a great time--
---
In Open World you can bring whatever you like but I'd stick with power Chrono too since its way cheaper getting Berserker than Viper, also you will clear Trash faster.
---
Only condition class without ramp up time would be Firebrands with either Grieving or Viper. I'd advise Viper so you can share the Set with your Berserker or Herald/Renegade. Firebrands focus on Burning wich has usually very low duration and ticks for quite high damage so its comparable to power classes. Also Firebrands can precast several AoE skills on phasing Bosses making them capable to upfront burst when the Target gets active, much like power classes.
---
Political stuff gets boring really quick. Party Politics, World Summit, Reforging the Pact are all great examples of exactly how boring it is gameplay wise.
---
#Reconactaully
---
GW2: now timegating questions as well.
---
It wouldn't hurt games, it would hurt stockholder interest in games. Sure, there would be a lot of downsizing in the short-term, but the industry would be a lot more ethically sound and producing more enjoyable games in the long run.
---
For business model, I would point to how Path of Exile made their money before they too indulged in cash shop RNG boxes: They have expensive update-themed supporter packs ranging between $30 to $250 to over $1000 USD. The latter end generally contains exclusive in-game skins, t-shirts, the game sound track, forum cosmetics, and other cheap but nice looking stuff. It's excellent whalebait.
---
Yep this is correct and I do believe they don't put development into the right areas which are genuinely repetitive content eg. spvp and WvW. If spvp and WvW weren't stale  I wouldn't care that LS maps are 2 hours then done.
---
#1: That wouldn't fit what Xhibit says on the show .
---
#2: No , because the one collection ( 3 ? ) has a timegate within a timegate , so you wait while you wait.
---
&gt; roller beetle is also hidden 
---
Nope, I just checked it on my alt account. The I haven't played anything in PoF aside from the first mission for the Raptor, but unlocked all episodes. 
---
Rollerbeetle masteries are visible, just like Skyscale's, original PoF ones and other LS4 masteries. And they are locked, so I can't get any exp until I get the mounts. Griffon masteries are the only hidden one. 
---
So the griffon is the *only* mount with these "optional" feel, you describe here. Aside from the griffon it's always the same rule -&gt; if you unlock an episode/expansion, you have to unlock all their masteries to get lvl-up spirit shards again. 
---
Only difference is the timegated stuff itself, so people have to wait 5 days to get spirit shards again. But well... a few days without spirit shards won't kill anybody. They are not that important and you have more then enough sources to get them.
---
I've not attempted the collections myself because i can't be bothered, but from what i've gathered:  
---
The Skyscale is obtained through a series of collections, among these collections only a fraction of it's progress can be completed every day, forcing players to spend several days completing the collections. Players therefore either force themselves through completing whatever they can every day until they're done, while others ignore it out of frustration.   
---
I don't know if Arenanet explicitly said that the Skyscale would be available from May 4th, but it sure ain't available until a couple of weeks after at least, when someone actually completes the collection.
---
GW2 is advertised for casuals. When people recommend a casual game, GW2 is the go to game.
---
Just like one of those grindy, life-sucking MMOs I ran away from to get here. Weee.
---
There is a megathread now
---
Complete strawman
---
I'm at like 450 transmutation charges or something... wish there was a way to exchange them for something useful. I can't even imagine how frequently I'd need to change looks to be at a deficit.
---
They sell for a touch over a gold at vendors.
---
The issue is that the timegating on this is extreme when compared to other similar content ie. mounts.
---
I don't understand why you're being downvoted. It was a good joke.
---
Maybe cause a bunch of them are new plebians who don't know Belgians can't access RNG cash shop content anymore. :P
---
Bit of a difference between this and a legendary.
---
How about make lots of engaging content of moderate difficulty with good rewards that you can finish as quickly or slowly as you like? HoT's current difficulty and reward level aee clearly popular, don't see why they don't just replicate that instead of inventing new ways to shoot themselves in the foot
---
God damnit. That got me. 9/10.
---
I change looks like every other day... if I didnt I'd probably be with you on this lol.
---
I dont expect every single item in the blc to be amazing quality... so if i get a rare item along with some transmutation charges, it's generally satisfactory to me
---
What are you using now with Condi Mirage? I have Viper and Grieving setups and don't have much trouble at all killing anything. Been maining condi mirage pretty much since PoF release. This is the build I use more or less: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Axe/x_Infinite_Horizon
---
But yeah you really need Viper to get the most performance out of Condi builds. Grieving works as an option as well and there are some free/cheap ways to get grieving over Viper but Viper is best. 
---
Chrono will kill most things faster though because as the other comment mentioned power &gt; condi for low health enemies. Power is just pure damage so the more damage you do the faster things will die. Conditions take time to do damage so you'll do more damage over time (DoT).
---
Looks spectacular! 
---
Has anyone made a size comparison yet? I know there's one for Zhaitan vs Mordremoth vs Primordus. I look forward to seeing Kralkatorrik added to the mix.
---
Also tequatl weapons have a black smoke effect, which regular ascended weapons don't. 
---
For the Scion weapons it seems to be a unique sparkling effect and a light glow.
---
There is. Guildwars 2 has kept people playing for years without needing these kinds of resets. While it does have some of them, they aren't mandatory for any one specific thing. They're more like bonuses that help people who don't have as much time to play progress.
---
And it's not like unsubbing refunds you the difference of what you spent to sub in the first place. They have even changed the veteran rewards to be based off of consistent subs rather than total days subed like it was prior to that change.
---
Gonna rip off another comment here: " Imagine seriously implying that FFXIV doesn't revolve around a core made  entirely of time-gating. Weekly limits on Allagan Tomestones, weekly  limits on loot from Normal/Savage &amp; 24-man raids, daily limits on  beast tribes, weekly limits on Custom Deliveries, gathering nodes that  are only available for a certain amount of time every hour/two hours,  I'm sure there's more that I'll remember next time I log in.. "
---
FFXIV thrives off of time-gating. You constantly repeat resets on a daily basis and have little reason to go back to old content unlike Guildwars 2 where there is so much content that is kept relevant that there is no need for resets. The whole point is to keep people subbed, not playing. In GW2, you can log in for an hour to do dailies and then continue to play if you choose and still progress. In XIV, you must commit an hour each day or you're locked out of a reset of progression. GW2 lets you set your own pace. XIV forces everyone to stick to the same pace like it's some kind of race where everyone stops after each lap and if you're not at the finish line before the next lap starts, you have to redo the whole thing with nothing gained for your prior efforts.
---
Kid yourself all you like. This ain't XIV or WoW.
---
I agree with you about the combat but while the game might be "cliche MMO to the core.", that is part of what makes it a better game than GW2. GW2 is supposed to be an MMO but half the time it doesn't really feel like one, the only thing getting consistent (for GW2 anyway) updates is the LS and that is something most players will do with 1 - 4 friends or by themselves. Everything else is left by the wayside, including something necessary in every MMO: actual content. Why even play an MMO if it's literally just for a mediocre / bad story? there are a lot of singleplayer games that can do that better. Even ESO does it better, while the story is nothing new, then again neither is GW2
---
s, it is much better written and the voice acting is superb. GW2 actually suffers from trying too hard to be unique in a genre that unique doesn't really work unless it is exceptional. I'm not talking about vertical progression, I'm talking about repeatable content and other basic things that other MMO's have down to a T. Sure GW2 is something you can "come back to after a year or two and not need to grind for 6 months" but they just aren't making enough PROFIT for NCSoft to consider them viable anymore, I can guarantee if they actually listened to their customers more often and put the LS on the backburner while focusing on expansions and making the game more MMO and less just a LS then they would be raking in money.
---
Too bad it doesn't have legendary abilities to go with its legendary effort to get it. :(
---
Just go Fullzerk for starters, changing some Items to Assassins requires specific group buffs like Warrior Banners and (or) Spotter from Rangers to get to 100% crit.
---
As long as you miss those classes you won't critcap and therefore loose the reason you went for Assassin in the first place.
---
Actual game time and effort is exactly the same without the timegate, it just won't be artificially lengthened for no reason.
---
Just means shit is loading slow. Same issue for me. I have a great PC and didn't have this issue before tuesday... wait for patch.
---
May 24 😂 ? What a mess.
---
Thank you I didn't know that. When I went there all hell broke loose and all four started trying to eat us. It was after we beat them that I was able to do it.
---
GW2 has practices that are just as questionable as ESO if not even more so.
---
Thank you 😊
---
"Search and rescue!"
---
(Because it's dead. We're at companion levels. I'm ok with this.)
---
You welcome, I'm very glad it was able to help you.
---
When you find a timegated item, that requires an timegated item, that requires itself a timegated item.
---
Sweet and thank you 😊
---
Doesn't sound like an MMO to me. MMO's are all about the carrot, you show off all the rewards you got from doing hard content to the other people playing. You incentivise other people to do challenging content with you to get the rewards.
---
MMOs are a different beast to Mario Brothers.
---
Could you provide some examples? I can't really think of any. Are there any characters from GW that could still be alive in GW2 and have malicious intents? Are there any characters introduced in GW2 that can still become a villain?
---
We dealt with (LS only, not raids, base story or expansion):
---
* Scarlet (GW2 character)
---
* Minister Caudecus (GW2 character)
---
* Lazarus (GW character)
---
* Palawa Joko (GW character)
---
Are there any that are a threat on such level like these? Maybe they introduce some new character out of blue like with Scarlet (I believe, never played LS1)?
---
That's not to mention the Charged Quartz crystals you need (something like 22 I heard), which potentially could mean you'd have to wait 22 days for it.
---
Yeah I just yeeted myself over to BFF and threw myself at one of the ice tornadoes. For once, I wasn't cursing for getting frozen.
---
That's the thing that gives a lot of people problems with the game.  It's very free-form at end-game.  You make your own goals, because there isn't a gear treadmill.
---
Taking care of gear without the treadmill is still something you can address, via exotic Berserker's gear, and you can start yourself on the path to obtaining Ascended Berserker's gear via various means (crafting, beginning Fractals, acquiring Living Story maps, raid training).  Beyond that, you'd want to try various things out and see how you enjoy them.  If you like five man instanced content like the dungeons, Fractals are the more rewarding option with a clear progression to them, so that would make sense to delve into.  World vs. World is a thing you can try for large-scale combat.  Fashion Wars is what a lot of people get into, you can check the full Wardrobe out at any bank and look for skins that you like, then determine how to obtain them.  You can hunt achievements, increasing your AP score and usually unlocking some extra skins or titles or equipment in the process.  When you get the expansions, that will open up the Elite Specializations for your chosen class, as well as Masteries to help you navigate maps via mounts/gliders/etc., so doing events and continuing to earn XP for those will be a priority.  The story gets better in the expansions and Living Story content, so you may want to pursue that.  And then the ultimate goal for many players becomes obtaining a Legendary weapon, an action that will require a lot of farming and map completion (the areas you need to map varying depending on the generation of Legendary).
---
So there's lots of things for you to do, but you need to decide what aspects you enjoy.  There is no one path that you must follow to get the strongest character.  This can cause issues for some players who are used to a gear treadmill and ever-expanding power, or who need others to set goals for them, but for many players it's quite liberating instead!
---
A big help, there's no way I'd have finished before reset without it, with it I came in at about 20 mins before reset time.
---
hoard all the things!
---
How is it cliche to the core? The world design is actually very similar to GW2 with an open world design. It has a large siege based pvp mode like GW2. Its questing is the most story based of any mmo with the exception of perhaps swtor. It has a trinity but its more relaxed than strict trinity based games like WoW.
---
Seconded. It's silly and I love it.
---
I am using that build. 
---
I've been grabbing nightmare gear from the dungeon vendor so I can have the runes + some okay armor before getting Vipers.
---
Are viper stats obtained through HoT story?
---
I mean, it flies up a bit
---
Good luck offloading your supply when the lamp itself is another daily.
---
\# before a line makes the line bold
---
#like this

What you want is a numbered list.  To do that, use

1\.

Not a typo, every line should start with "1."  Reddit will auto-number them.  Like this:

1. This is a point I am making
---
1. This is also a point

 1. This sub-point of point number 2 (which I typed as 1)
---
 1. You do this by still starting with "1." but by putting a space in front of it

1. These all start with "1."
---
No, instead it's "we'll wait a week and hope people stop being mad so we don't have to do anything."
---
Uh, that means the problem still exists for Roller Beetle ?
---
they're not interested in earning a bit from you when they can design their loot boxes to exploit the mentality of some whale with a gambling addiction who will give them a shit ton. it's easier and cheaper to design it for the whale than it is to design it for a player who isn't addicted to gambling and will only make reasonable purchases and at the end of the day it is a whole lot more profitable too.
---
I vomited a little

I'm not in it to make money; I'm in it for the convenience of myself.

Glint doesn't have to lie to be wrong.
---
Edited to remove other thoughts that probably dont apply yet.
---
Can't wait for when we get to the train you skyscale collections and you can only do it 2 times a day because the little shit gets tired
---
It’s still important to play, otherwise you’ll be pretty lost on the story in HoT.
---
just to be clear, you do still earn exp, but you're right that you can't access any of the spirit shards until you finish the collection. when you finish, you'll get all the exp (and spirit shards) you've accumulated.
---
they definitely should change it for people who have no interest in the skyscale, but for the people working on it, we will at least get our exp eventually
---
Or log off and comeback reset.
---
There are a ton of story/achievement ways of getting exotic viper gear, you can also craft them. For accessories Living World Season 3 maps are the best/easiest way if you own them. Couple wiki links for you:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Viper%27s
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Equipment_acquisition_by_stats
---
I absolutely prefer Rox. She’s my favorite LS character
---
Except I've seen differently dyed ones.  
---
You can't dye a mount if its not unlocked.
---
/u/CalmestChaos answered your specific question.
---
In general, you pay for certainty, both IRL and on the TP. You gamble (eg. buying rare unidentified gear, wintersday gift, or divine lucky envelope), you may get what you want cheaper than buying it direct, or you may get a whole heap of stuff you didn't want.
---
From what I have read, it is usually more economical to sell your "bags" and buy the specific things you need.
---
*Flashbacks to Floorrik*
---
Lol, [you were right!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bp10qj/so_whore_the_voiceactors_for_certain_characters/entsoym/).
---
If their maps are so shallow that people only play for 3 hours then complain about no content then maybe Anet should make better content. Stretching out what you do have artificially isn't content.
---
wait u do need hot to do the mount ?
---
Well, the next part requires you to do a minimum of 10 events for *each lane*... so, you'll be seeing the map. Of course, if you want your turn-in before reset, you're going to have to do those events at a break-neck pace.
---
1) you don't know that would be simple (evidence suggests it would not be)
---
2) that's trading one problem for another
---
They're in for a shock when they realize how few skyscale skins they sell.
---
so it's a hot and pof mount ? i mean u do need both of them to get the mount?
---
I don't really like those posts either, but they mostly get downvoted fast enough if they're low effort posts. The point is, this is one single point. You're talking about broad topics of more general interest to more people. Do people hate time gating? Yep.  Has time gating been part of this game for a very long time. Yep.  Mawdrey was time gated a long long time ago, unless you bought the food from the TP.  Quartz crystals have always been time gated. Ascended armor is time gated. Laurels are time gated.
---
New mount comes out, time gated. In one month most people who really want the skyscale will have it and this will be a non-issue until the next time gated thing came out.  I've had time gated back pieces, time gated achievements. It's part of the game and has been for a long time.
---
The main reason people are complaining is because they have to have it nao. If you really think that has more value to the community than welcoming someone new from WoW, that's okay. But I think this community might have figured out that time gating is something this company has done for a long time, and will likely continue to do...and my game isn't affected at all by it. 
---
Those I'm a WoW refugee threads don't hurt anything, even if they come up too often. This sort of outcry is just uncalled for. A new player asking for tips will get downvoted usually, but in the meantime it's showing people there's interest in the game, which is not a bad thing. 
---
Now that there's a mega thread, most of my complaints are moot anyway.
---
I was happy and positive after completing the story and getting familiar with the map, but the skyscale fiasco, as it unfolded.. You know. Kinda negated it all. Plus disabled map completion rewards, I completed Dragonfall to get currency and a rare. No key. Here's that too. So now it's mostly bad aftertaste and being angry at Anet for effectively ruining the whole episode experience for me.
---
Yep. Sad thing is, if people listened they could get all of them in one go :P 
---
But hence the catmander tag :^)
---
Thanks, I'd just woken up when I replied to the first post and hadn't seen it yet.
---
&gt; better community
---
Lmao; I mean unless you're into that kind of thing anyway.
---
Look at the bright side:  it saved you one Laurel.
---
Aribiter of the death location? :S
---
All jokes aside, I really like this comic format + your art style!
---
Tyria could literally explode for all I care now, and I would be more than happy if the 1st to.die were the dam skyscales
---
People are being forced to wait behind time gates so they can actually play the content.  Really not that difficult to comprehend.
---
It looks rather cheap and ugly, too. And reused animation. You're literally grinding with the expectation in mind to get good skins in the future, because sure as hell the base version isn't worth it
---
Honestly gw2 needs to start competing with these hardcore MMOs and leave it’s current state of only being played for a few weeks every 3 months. It’s such a good game, but I fear they’ve wasted much of the potential it had
---
is this a troll post or something?
---
it wasn't even hard the first time arround.
---
Wanting to play the new content instead of waiting on time gates equals having everything handed over on a silver plate to you?
---
I love his little stompy legs
---
So with the timegates, I have time to spare to type this up.
---

I have been doing it more slowly, since when I found out today about the charged quarts needed, I only had 1. (I donated almost all of mine to a guild since I thought I didn't need them anymore. HAH)
---
I actually enjoy collections.
---
It's fun to go out and niche things in the world you never would be doing otherwise.
---
Probably and unpopular opinion tho.
---
Yea I'm in the same boat. Although I actually like the mount quite a lot. Dragons are my favourite animals, so I'm a little biased haha. 
---
I don't mind putting the effort into unlocking things. I'm usually very patient. I can only play a couple hours every few days, so I usually expect these things to take awhile. If it took a month to unlock and was actually an enjoyable process, I wouldn't have a single complaint. 
---
I don't know how they thought running around the map three times over and over pressing "f" would be a fun time. Then to have wait on top of that. Did they not play test this and get opinions before releasing what is potentially the most boring and tedious collection they could have thought of? Does the person or people who design this collection even play the game?
---
I think a large part of it comes from the inconsistency with prior mounts. They hyped this thing up and didn't tell people this was supposed to be a largef process to get. I bet a lot of people probably based their expectations on mounts we've gotten in the past. I know I did. I honestly went in expecting this to be like the beetle/warclaw. I was shocked to see it was the beetle collection x10.
---
I'm hoping the next parts of this collection are better than the first ones. I'm trying really hard not to judge this collection too hard until I actually finish it. It feels pretty bad so far though.
---
Please, leave this mobile crap out of Guilds Wars 2. Timegates like this are used to hide how little content this LS introduced.
---
Thats not what MMOs are about, congrats you're one of the dumbass that Blizzard markets to.
---
stop whining XD
---
I totally agree with you, I was just saying that there were a few situations in which timegating is somewhat excusable. This whole situation is not one of those.
---
It's complicated: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gathering#Respawn_rate

Most quartz nodes operate under standard "a few hours" reset. home node resets at daily reset. I believe the rich vein in the Queen's lair in Dry Top is a 23-hour node, but there's a slim chance I'm misremembering and it's a special node that resets hourly so you can harvest it every sandstorm.
---
I seriously don't understand why everybody is so mad about the timegate. It's not like any of you would stop playing Guild Wars within the next two weeks, so why not get some extra incentive to log in every day?
---
Of course the achievements aren't perfect. Like having to complete multiple collections in the same map was pretty annoying. The second day, going all around Tyria on the other hand was really fun and I also adore the day 3 collection where you have to collect food and toys.
---
The Charged Quartz recipes are, in my opinion, a good way of giving players a choice between "spend some money" or "be dilligent". It's not like you get forced to buy the things off the TP.
---
The only thing that sucks is that we're not earning any exp from PoF maps. I assume that will be fixed at some point...?
---
Good one
---
collection still the most intersting part about the game
---
You can in this case actually ;)
---
Must be nice being in a winning server
---
Time gates are for one thing and one thing only, to force you to log in every day.
---
t4 fractals is pretty easily 20+ gold per day just doing dailies
---
Perhaps it's less about accessing newer areas, but just having alternative ways to get there that may or may not be faster or more convenient.
---
If memory serves me right, an episode costs 200 gems, which would equal to about 70 gold.
---
It's doable.
---
It’s the luminous set from the sixth anniversary gift.
