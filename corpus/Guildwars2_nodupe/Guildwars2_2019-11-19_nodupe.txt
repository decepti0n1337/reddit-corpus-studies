Just log in today, and you can play it *if* you have Path of Fire expansion.
---
---
---
I disagree with you on that. BDO tried for something and it just never really clicked for me. I don’t enjoy their combat system.
---
Cheers
---
They gave us a general plan now, though: These are the three things they are working on at the moment, and there are clearly other things they want to address going forward. I'm also not sure where everyone's pulling April from as a date, as it's hard to interpret "early in the new year" as anything later than late January or early February unless you assume they're lying through their teeth for no reason. Yeah, we probably won't get any changes until some time in February or March, but that's an entirely reasonable timeline when you consider the logistics of developing software like this. It isn't like they can just slap on a quick and dirty hotfix in a few weeks, not with player inventory on the line.
---
Why even develop a MMORPG in the first place, for fuck's sake. Just make a game full of cheap AI bots, many of them are better at PvP than real players anyway lmao.
---
The 22nd est time.
---
&gt; Casual players that dont interact with anyone (pressing 1 or F in the vicinity of other players isnt interaction btw) obviously dont care for famous players. 
---

---
These people aside. Unfortunately, a large proportion of playerbases from other games are those players looking to "get good". They look toward the "pros" or "good players" , "achieved players" as *inspiration t*hat drives them to play and practice etc etc. It's part of what keeps the community going. Something GW2 does not really have. Kind of how fans of football/soccer (choose whatever you will), who love the game may look up to certain players. They have dreams, aspirations, whether you might find it stupid or not in a video game doesn't matter. It's a reality and it's what keeps at least a sizeable subset of people playing the game.
---
This is same bad argument as people who are against game discounts, or when gw2 became f2p
---
And that a positive change cant be made because some people would not want it to be better for everyone
---
Do the Flame Legion really count as a race?
---
as others said you can't do both with the same set of gear
---
but in raids there are like 6 dps slots and only 0-1(2) boon chrono slots..so yea go dps version imo and have some diviner trinkets around for boons
---
I know it was a lengthy description but to me the thoughts all come together in seconds. It seems natural to me that cash shop items’ existence is explained by they were made by the people in world who run the cash shop business
---
&gt; the actual implementation well into April.
---
They don't even say April, I mean it could be 2021 with the pace some things get done.
---
Even if we get the 10 slots for builds later on, which they already planned for, its still to few.
---
And lets be really none who actually asked for build templates for years wanted them do be tied to inventory slots, anyone who where using multiple builds already had bough inventory slots anyway.
---
This is just anet wanting to justify a higher cost for their templates, most who care about not just having the same unoptimized build/gear in every game mode dont even use every 18 "inventory slots", most of their builds only have 1-3 gear changes.
---
Yet anet still compares every build template as a full unlimited 18 slot inventory slot...
---
The least we would need is 15 slots, or 10 slots if they would be separated for every game mode just to make it somewhat bearable.
---
Didn't auto switch use to only switch your traits and not your gear?
---
I see where you're coming from, I'm not planning on playing much, just a couple of hours at night every other day, I guess I miss the mmorpg element of being on a guild and do stuff together, playing alone is boring for me and I remember fondly the experience of exploring a dungeon, getting gear and discover things while being in coms with ppl you know what I mean?
---
I understand the game is free now, I dont need to look for my old credentials then? cause I did buy the early access years ago.
---
It's not the community's decision. I just don't see anet refunds up to thousands of gems to players.
---
thanks mate.  I will discard FFXIV
---
i dont really care until they make them TEMPLATES, not LOADOUTS
---
Then April comes, they release a new build that tweaks templates a bit, and then a bug breaks WvW in some fashion.
---
In that case, if you can dig out the old account then try it. Your characters will have some birthday gifts in their mailboxes (each year on the day of creation of the character it will have a "birthday" and receive these gifts). Otherwise if you don't mind starting again it will be ok.
---
[[1d20]] +/u/rollme
---
A brand new account has restrictions, so it would be better if you found your old account. Only the base game is free and if you buy Path of Fire, you'll get Heart of Thorns too. Sometimes PoF goes on sale really cheap, [just keep an eye on it](https://isthereanydeal.com/game/guildwarsiipathoffire/info/).
---
&gt; If we ignore the autoswap which already existed before
---
And was destroyed with build templates. 
---
But hey, if we ignore all changes, they will do nothing!
---
&gt; Read it multiple times,
---
And still don't understand...

The game is designed for any class to be played together. It does away with the dps/tank/support trinity and every class can heal itself, so you can solo most content apart from high level instanced stuff and won't need to worry too much about class combos until the extremely high end, niche endgame like max level fractals or raids.
---
&gt; Well, instead of saying a lot of passive aggresive stuff, how about you explain it to me then?
---
What should I explain? Your assumption about 2-3 years developing time is just wrong. Not hard to understand. 
---
&gt; Also they said "we talked about templates intern" a few years ago, so i thought at that point it was on the table for developing.
---
Yeah... on the table =/= in development...
---
NATURAL 1 MOTHERFUCKER
---
On things you hate. some hard to swallow pills:
---
1  
---
Its easy if you use your brain and think. They cant give you meaningfull reward when 2525 other people will get the same reward everytime. Because unlike WoW in gw2 everyone get their own loot, any thing that drops from event/mob/boss is worthless because it drops like crazy. No one will buy it as its so easy to drop youself, and everyone will have it. So there is huge supply , low demand. If it would be accound bound skin, everyone will have it so it wont be "cool" anyway. In this situation the best thing they can give you are materials and some currency.. and they do that ! Long story short we will never have good rewards in this game as something drop too often and is not worth shit, or if they want to make something to be worth anything it will drop so rarely that no one will see it and people will cry about it as they wont have money to buy it (like all infusions/khan ur helmet/chair from strike mission etc).  
---
  
---
2  
---
oh you dont like horizontal progresion game? then QUIT and go to WoW as you clreadly would like some vertical progresion dude. In a game without gear progression in end game the only thing you can have are skins. DEAL WITH IT.  
---
3  
---
They fixed that with unidentified gear so stop crying. Since that change I dont have any problems with inventory.     
---
4  
---
ok, but you can use youtube there are more guides that we will ever need.  
---
5  
---
Dueling? is it 2012? Sounds good but wont ever happen as no one really need it. Devs dont have time to work on important things so they wont work on things few crazy people still dream about. Also overall we wont get any new pvp modes, EVER. This game is not in active development anymore. So dont expect new things like that. We can only get more of what we already have and some QoL. Also they tryied with stronghold and no one wanted to play that. PvP is almost dead so new modes would actually be a bad idea as there isnt enough people to play normal mode already.  
---
6  
---
Look above. Deal with it, as we will never get new pvp mode. I bet all money on that. Also most people thing right now that fractals are also dead like dungeons. And that we may only get 1 more raid and thats it. The reason is people dont play raids or fractals , so Anet wont waste their time doing them. Strike missions are future right now. Get used to them and like them or quit.  
---
7  
---
There are some well know players, mostly pvp and streamers. But I agree no one know people from the servers, or even guilds from the servers. Its all because of megaserver system. We play big single player game. Also guild system is dead because anet never liked guilds .. in guild wars..  
---
8  
---
agree  
---
9  
---
I dont really get what you are saying here. You dont like grind? As I said above because we all share a big NA/EU market there are huge number of items and materials in the economy. You cant just gather few vegetables or some wood and have enough money to buy cool shits. As lots of players are also doing this. So this things are worth less and less. so you need to gather or kill more and more things to have enough things to sell to get enough gold from this. So yeah grind. Anet cant also give you too much gold from easy activity like dungeons or 1 world boss. As again lots of players would get it so gold will be worth less. You would have more of it but it would be worth less so nothing would change from your perspective. Again basic economy my dude.   
---
10  
---
Yes I dont agree with you here. I dont want to wait 2 years with nothing to play 2 months. I prefer to wait 2 months and play for a week. Honestly. I would kill myself and quit the game if I need to wait 2 years with nothing. We here almost killed ourselfs in big (1 year) content drought that happened near first expansion. It were a dark times my friend, No one want to get back to them. And that asside they dont have money anymore to invest in a big projects like expansion. They tried 2 times and it didnt work for them. People hated Hot for beeing too hard.. Then people hated PoF for beeing too easy... yeah. Anet said fuck it! and now will only do sagas. And I agree with them. Long big projects like expansions take too much money and time and are not a good investment. If you fail en episode people will soon forget, nothing big will happen, not much money will be lost. If you fail the expansion... you have a situation we are in right now where people say gw2 is dead. Expansions in a way anet was able to do them are bad for this game. Too little too late and with too much of a cost. Again deal with it, no more expansions. The best we can get is sagas that will give us cool shits like elite specializations. (they said its possible so its the only hope for us).

That’s what they want you to think. It wouldn’t be unfair to increase the total amount of slots and give those to everyone while keeping the current locked ones available to purchase. So people who purchased some would still have extra slots, no refund necessary.
---
This is a simple solution to a greedy problem. They created the issue, they can fix it, but of course they won’t. All they care about is how much money this can make them, it’s not about fairness.
---
That's a pretty good idea actually.
---
Let's keep those down votes coming my precious doom flowers. Show the world your rage. Get your dopamine with dat puesdo validation XD.
---
Yeah, but that's the story thing we already received with the new map, right?
---
"I have spoken" - EAnet 
---
xD
---
just want to say its always good to see people who know why rewards are like they are in this game. Whenever I see people cry about rewards I get angry as they simply dont realise supply and demand basics. Gw2 have shits rewards because it was build on a rule that everyone get their own rewards so the scale effect is strong as fuck. Anything that drops will get worthless after a while like you said. And something that is designed to be expensive like infusions will never drop as its drop chance NEED to be minimal. If infusions drop like elder wood no one would care about them as everyone would have them.. And people care about them because they are rare , not because they look good..
---
&gt; So... we won't even get a status update on just the few changes they do until next year, let alone actually changes ... lol.
---
They already explained why in the post. They only have a few weeks left before Xmas and they have things already on their plate as it is.
---
No, the accounting and budgeting departments don't work that way.  "Hey AP dept just come up with a ton of money that's not in your budget to hand out to players because we're rolling back something we sold"
---
So they're not addressing the fact you only get two equipment slots to start and not three and they aren't addressing the costs. Gotcha.
---
Can't make me spend money I don't have! (taps head) The solution to this is to simply be poor.
---
/s
---
You can’t transmute legendary gear?!
---
I know I always get people disagreeing with this but... Local storage is clearly outside of their design principles for this game. The only thing currently in the game that is stored client side is your graphics settings and, while I get that 15 years ago that was an acceptable desigb choice, local storage in a modern MMO is likely to create bad user experiences. You may think it's worth it, but I don't think a game UX designer would.
---
That’s just concept art. Artists are not required to know every little detail about the universe.
---
Use teamviewer to buy gems into the target account. Better if done with paypal since the password or any other important information are visible for the person in the other end of the transaction. That's how I've been able to buy this kind of things for friends' birthdays.
---
If you really think cosmetic updates and a pretty regular release schedule are bad things then idk.
---
We do things because we enjoy them. There isn't anything inherently bad or exploitative about a system that functions on this most basic of principles.
---
Source is I am relatively well connected
---
Yes, you can but it costs transmutation charges. You only have one armor set while people with multiple ascended sets can enjoy having multiple styles.
---
@mightyteapot!
---
Thank you :-)
---
Guess when did the HoT reward rework was promised and then done?
---
SPOILER: &gt;!next year &amp; April!&lt;
---
dead game is dead  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
You will if you play and pay attention to them!
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
BLC exclusive.
---
I just wish there were some decent looking cosmetics earnable via gameplay. 99% of decent looking skins are all Gem Store or BLC exclusive.
---
The "grind gold &gt; buy gems &gt; buy skins" method just isnt enjoyable and gives no sense of accomplishment.
---
Same I think haha.
---
Hmm, don't recall hearing anything about that before they added it in. Must have not been paying as close attention to the game's development at the time.
---
Per account
---
Yeah the whole picture is just great. This and the kodan raft are my all time favorits.
---
They give you gems back which doesn't affect them at all because they still have your cash.
---
it doesn't hurt them to refund a portion of the gems. the players can't turn that back into cash and it just gets them looking through the gem store for stuff to buy and possibly to save up for.
---
Honestly I don't like most of the gem store skins and I find plenty of stuff in game that I like quite a lot. Admittedly some of the better stuff in game is grindy but I find that okay.
---
Yes, they’re giving a progress report Jan/Feb, and then an additional few months to actually test and implement. So March/April.
---
I wish I could have the old system back for PvP.
---
It's just been nothing but more work for me.
---
I'm sure it'll be another run of "log in, play for a day, log off for 3 months."
---
But if I didn't get any of those effects,  I wouldn't play games lol.
---
And then it turns out Jory was Raven all along.
---
Bro its a pain, but 100% worth it.
---
Your comment is your opinion, and there's nothing wrong with that at all, but it doesn't make it true for the entire community. There are a good amount of decent looking skins that aren't in the Gem Store. Some people like the grind gold -&gt; buy gems -&gt; buy skins because it allows them to play the content they want and enjoy. Some people don't want to do a collection to earn a skin, or do specific content to earn it (Legendary Armor/Raids).
---
The biggest gripe I have with the community right now is that any time Anet tries to sell something, people freak out over it. They are a company, trying to earn a profit. Anything in the gem store can be earned through playing the game. Things in the gem store are not pay to win. I can't fault a company for trying to make money. That's not to say that I agree with everything they do, or they can't do better, but what good is losing my mind over it?

---
Give up and go home like your were taught to do.
---
On another news: nothing worth having is easy. Take that life lesson with you.
---
i really hope so, because i feel a burn out coming... and that usually means i stop playing for a few months to ever.... still never beat zenosaga because of a burn out- even after buying all of them. still regret that one....
---
yea? does it get better than the loaner ones in dragonfall?
---
I've been thinking about how companies can do microtransactions without pissing off quite as many people. What if the gem store skin purchases gave you a little good quality story quest you had to beat to actually unlock the item? 
---
For example, this one could give you a destroyer stone you use to track down the animal and capture it.
---
Obviously this doesn't replace getting skin options included with the base product, but I'm curious if the story quest would mitigate the "not really earned" part of the problem.
---
I believe you misread, I have no mobile and never added SMS auth. 
---
Yet these are being requested for me to log in, which I can't provide because I have no mobile to request. 
---
I can't log-in currently so I'm waiting to hear back from support. My question was to ask if others are experiencing similar issues.
---
Open world pve and achievement hunting are endgame too, even if it isn't hardcore combat content.
---
Skyscale is a jack of all trades. It's like the celestial stat of mounts. Only thing it's straight up a replacement for is the springer, but that's only after masteries and springer still has cannonball. 
---
In 90% of situations it's better than griffon. That behind said, in those 10% the griffon is _really_ good.
---
I recommend getting both. I would do Skyscale first for sure, but they can be long term goals.
---
The collection is meant for to be immersion experience. I'd recommend giving stuff like that a more zen approach. Put on some headphones with GW2 sounds going. Don't zoom out all the way. Then follow the hints while taking your time to explore the maps and get into the lore. The whole PvE is meant to be an an immersion experience really. I think a lot of people miss that. 
---
I think open world PvE is mostly made for those who want that kind of thing too. Though I can understand those not into that. 
---
I know it sucks doing it for you but I can tell you it's worth it. Hands down the best overall mount to have.
---
All we wanted was templates. Since release of the game. Is seven years of feedback not enough?
---
Thank you for the details!
---
is bound for blood the one that happened a month or two ago? might already have it.
---
Can we have a cosplay of this? Just to be sure it looks ridiculous.
---
Silly question, but do you also unlock the story chapter while currently in progress of an older story chapter or do you need to activate it in order to permanently unlock it?
---
PvE is a thing?
---
yea, crafting is another one of my gripes... especially getting past the bronze limit.... only craft i've gotten past 100 is in my first char, jeweling.... i still hop on there to make stuff for my other chars sometimes.
---
well if that's the only complaint, i can live with that. haha.
---
i'm having a hard time getting into it though... especially since the in game direction seems lacking.... if it weren't for the guide, i don't think i would have found the divinity reach npc at all...
---
what is griffon better at, out of curiosity?
---
There is no need to quit doing the collections completely.  
---
Just focus your thief.  But might I suggest grab one or two locations at the start of each time you play and you will probably get both the thief done and the skyscale done around the same time.  
---
That said I don't have mine yet but am about to start the final section so will have it shortly
---
that seemed to be the consensus when i was looking up guides... think it was on the gw2 forums mainly. looking like that was a niche opinion though, so that makes me happy. haha.
---
Meh, I don't even read the forums cause they're heavily moderated safe space from all that I hear (only positivity allowed, criticism is labeled bullying)
---
And people wonder why Anet is so reluctant to engage with the whiny pissants that is the community :thinking:
---
If you have the starting height going from a to b over a long distance and bring able to stay above everything. 
---
Watch some of the runs of the Springer race from Halloween to see how the skyscale can be utilized in smaller bursts
---
Anet is walking along the correct way ! Good Try !
---
The one they released con September 17
---
I'm going to guess that someone got into your account and added their own phone to make it harder to take back.  I haven't heard anything about them forcing everyone to use sms authentication, and I think even they wouldn't implement it such that it doesn't even check whether or not the account has a phone associated with it.
---
They did something recently and are now offering a free mini if you add sms auth.
---
Wasn't that months ago?  Anyways, that's an incentive, not a directive.
---
Yeah, that DR npc lol. Definitely needs a bit more love from the devs for a fine polish but I think the direction is on point. 
---
It can be tough that's for sure. But you get a better rush on completing it without imo.
---
So, you are categorically against non-productive entertainment?
---
Wtf is going on nowadays
---
Surely you've never played any other MMORPGs if you think the game will survive on either of those.
---
I'm not sure that logic holds up... I've seriously played half a dozen MMOs, including both successful and failed ones, and I wouldn't say any of them proved what you're proposing here. Can you explain what you mean?
---
Also, I was responding to the phrase "less and less endgame content". Replacing one type of endgame content with another isn't less.
---
I recently did the same! Scouring dragonfall 3 different times was pretty ridiculous. Just wait until you get to the part where you need 250 map currency from like 7 maps. Truly awful. It is taking me forever. Good luck!
---
Recently being at least a year ago? If you're referring to the dragon mini
---
Comparing the 2 isn't exactly the best way to go about it. They both fly but they occupy different spheres of utility. And in my personal day to day experience with both I find myself utilizing both for different reasons. Good luck with the unlocking. It was a slog but on the bright side they've made it easier since the first week. Also it helps when you focus less on the destination and just experience the journey.
---
There are some interesting concepts and world building prospects in there that could be explored in some brilliant ways, but my eyes kind of glaze over when we start talking about divine wars and angels and demons. 
---
I think they made the right choice with going the direction that they chose to go in, there are just some bits, as with any piece of media, that could have perhaps been explored a bit more thoughtfully.
---
Why does recreational reading work?
---
"Dopamine, baby!"
---
just get more legendary gear and transmute it. you dont need free legendary transmutations.
---
The better question is at what point do we rename PvP to PvB?
---
Please tag me too! I want to know more about this.
---
I think that's what they want to address with this:
---
&gt; Greater flexibility when making experimental changes to templates.
---
No, they're right, nothing recent. They've been offering the mystic dragon mini as an incentive for adding 2 factor authentication for years. Try contacting support ASAP! Hope everything turns out alright!
---
Something changed recently, I'm not sure what. I didn't have this problem before nor did the first person that approached me about it.
---
Like others already explained, blocker blocks wurms from spitting with projectile destruction and invulnerability.
---
From what Kitty once participated in Triple Trouble, she found revenant super-effective for blocking the eggs. She simply kept Ventari tablet's Protective Solace on the wurm while everyone else was doing the mechs. She only missed one set of wurms. You can't really do much else while at it but just alone doing that properly, you pretty much make the boss super-easy for everyone else.
---
But yes I'm waiting to hear back from support.
---
Well, just pretend you are interested to apply and ask.
---
It's really just auto-save vs. manual save. "Loadouts" as they're called here are when the template gets auto-saved when you make a change. "Templates" refer to templates where you manually save changes.
---
Let's say you're experimenting with... elementalist traits, I guess. You had Bolt to the Heart selected in build template 1, but you want to check out the same build with Fresh Air instead, so you manually swap the trait. Later, you switch to build template 2, then back to 1 again.
---
How it currently works: When you switch back to template 1, Fresh Air will still be selected.
---
How some people want it to work: When you switch back to template 1, Bolt to the Heart is selected.
---
So I'll start by saying this isn't a defense of the current implementation, more just food for thought:  
---
It's really easy as a player to call out flaws and annoyances in a competitive match making system, but for GW2 especially it's a very complicated problem without a clear best answer. The roles thing is one of the biggest struggles. Basically, everyone has a very large number of possible builds they can play. Having some kind of system that figures out their role based on these selections is a massive undertaking if it would even be possible with how fast the meta can change.  
---
To compound that issue, players can switch characters entirely inside a match, so even if you had a system where players choose a role voluntarily, they could simply switch to something else later.  
---
They actually used to have a system where the game tried to prevent duplicate professions in the same game, but it overall created worse games that were less balanced because it often had to expand the search to lower rated players faster than it does now.  
---
As for the performance factors, it sucks to lose when you feel like you didn't do anything wrong, but the reality is it's a team game. There is almost always something you could do better, and that goes for everyone on the team, even the top of the team player. It also DOES currently give you bonuses for doing good yourself, in the form of the top damage, top healing ,etc. Getting those give you extra reward pips, so that is their attempt to make that a thing.  
---
Again, this isn't meant to say that it's perfect and amazing how it is--I think everyone agrees it's not--it's more to bring up how complex of an issue it is which hopefully will make for a more philosophical take on it. :)

It's not logic...it's experience...which you lack, and not something your instant downvoting will resolve, nor help you gain.
---
That was over 4 years ago and 2FA can be done without a phone.
---
If you feel a burn out coming, just stop and do something else that you actually enjoy doing.  You control your own burn out, remember.  And another approach is limit yourself to about 10 minutes a day for skyscale.
---
You posted an arrogant non-productive blanket statement with no explanation. I believed it did not contribute to the conversation, so I downvoted it.
---
If you had disagreed with me using... Any actual argument, I wouldn't have downvoted.
---
Now you're doubling down on insults and a lack of argument or explanation? Do you want to discuss this or just sling garbage?

Your instant downvote is still not helping, but I'm sure it helps you feel good inside.

I think they're talking about how we already had 3 build templates in-game through each game mode saving your build. Though it's nice for people that just play one mode to have the previous template slots unlocked for use in said mode, those who play more than one didn't get much, and those who played all three got nothing new. In fact, the experience is a strict downgrade if you play multiple modes (maybe not so strict if you play two, but definitely if you play all three), since you now have to remember to switch and then do so manually instead of before when things were automatic. 
---
Personally, I'd argue to at least give four build slots and three gear slots to start, at least for paid accounts (those who bought GW2/HoT/PoF), both to actually add value to the feature over what was there before (especially if it's still going to subtract convenience) and to support the bare minimum of builds/gearsets (power/condi/WvW, plus a PvP build) for most classes while leaving room to buy one or two slots for characters from more complex classes (healer, support, tank, and/or kiter, etc.), especially if they're going to stick with slot unlocks being character-bound.
---
I agree with you on it being inconvenient, though. A supposed QoL feature (a.k.a. a convenience feature) should make things more convenient, not less, and if a feature ends up making things less convenient, they should probably tweak it until that's not the case, otherwise it's like trying to douse a fire with gasoline.
---
As I solo casual player I got burnt out doing Skyscale as well but I am so happy I finished it. I mostly use skyscale for everything minus a few instances where I may prefer griffin, raptor, or beetle (crossing maps fast with alts that don’t have WPs yet).
---
I'm absolutely not the best person to explain the nuance but I'll try. 
---
It's basically the difference between having a "save" function, or auto-saving. Loadouts auto-save all changes you make because it's like putting things in a box. Here, we get three boxes to put things in. If you want to experiment with a build that you're not sure is going to work, you can't easily say "nah, don't save this" because you had to change what's in the box in order to test, and therefore you've already changed the loadout.
---
Templates are more like reference lists of what should be in the box. You can change what you're currently playing with to test things, but you didn't have to change your lists to experiment.
---
Because the system ArenaNet went with auto-saves, it's a loadout system, not templates.
---
From data-mining, we know that they even called them Loadouts in the code.
---
u/Eitth, you wanted a tag, so hopefully you both find this at least a little helpful!
---
Just to verify, when logging in the client explicitly says it sent a text message to a phone and asks you to type in a number from that text message, right?
---
The way the two factor authentication works is it goes: 
---
you input password &gt; (if correct) &gt; send text message to phone &gt; ask for number from text message &gt; input number from text message &gt; log in
---
If it doesn't explicitly say it sent a text message to a phone and ask you to input a number, then either your password was changed or you're putting it in incorrectly. If it's the latter, I know one thing I've done before sometimes when entering passwords is forget that caps lock is on (also sometimes the key can get stuck) or number lock isn't on, etc...

You sound like a decent percentage of my guild. We have people who play every day, probaby about 30 of us, but there are a bunch of people in the guild who show up some weeks, miss other weeks. Casual guilds aren't built around the convenience of the guild. They're built around the convenience of the player.

Lots of people have jobs, families, lives, responsibilities, other hobbies. So they log in when they want. You should check out some casual guilds that have no rep requirements. There are plenty of us out there.

Be patient and enjoy the process, why does everyone demand instant gartification.  Anything worth having is going to be hard too get.  When you're done the quest you'll never have to do it again so just take your time and enjoy it.

---
Downvote aside, we're three comments in and you haven't made any attempt to back up your statement beyond what effectively comes out to that you're simply more 1337 than me, so I just don't get it, and I definitely don't get how someone so "experienced" is acting so childish and calling me childish over a) worthless points and b) following the reddit guidelines on voting.

Did you try updating your graphics drivers recently? Sometimes that gives me problems like that. It could be an indicator that your GPU is dying too. There was something else that caused it too... but I can't remember what it was

No. It's real fun when my skills jump around on their own. Who needs customized keybinds anyway.

When people talk about end game they usually refer to "raids/dungeons/pvp" at least in traditional MMOs. They  usually mean what i do when i have all the gear i want,all the legandaries i want, all the classes and builds i want,im at the apex of progression and im looking for the next big thing to tackle.  Collections and achievements are a nice filler but they hardly constitute a full blown end game experience.  They are good for those that play very sporadically or very few hours a week as they offer a sense of freedom and relaxed playing (no need for efficiency/meta builds/grouping) but for those who play lots of hours they can burn through collections/achievements too fast to even be considered content let alone end game content. End game content is mostly about repeatability and challenge after having completed most of the other things you were interested in (collections/achievements/leveling/gearing etc).
---
Today a new story/map comes out. I will have completed story in about an hour and it will take me about a week to complete all the achievements and worthwhile collections depending on the grind.  This is all seasonal content that gets played for a month or two and then gets forgotten. Same happened with Grothmmar, 1 week after release the lfg is dead except from strikes which were the only repeatable content. Most people just go play other games after that until the next release simply because apart from raids/dungeons/pvp there's nothing to play repeatedly when new content gets completed by the playerbase.

I don't really like springer skins but the Sun Gecko is just amazing from a graphical standpoint.
---
with how templates ended up...we ALL got coal this year
---
But you know that there are hybrid solutions... Like dling stuff once at session start and use the local copy and only communicate if things change and doublecheck if critical requests are made. This is not some unsolved voodoo. There is zero reason build-templates in particular cannot be locally stored and checked/transfered very irregularily.
---
The other thing here is communication: "technical limitation" is PR-BS and is not satisfying as justification. Database-performance reason is maybe justifiable, but even then this particular feature would be so badly designed then. And this is what it comes to: It feels just all around badly designed - probably because they just cannot touch anything related to inventory without breaking everything.
---
They also temporarily store stuff like movement (-prediction) locally or you would experience rubberbanding FAR more often.
---
While it' true I do not know at this point what people with reasonable mind are expecting. The game is free to play, they moved away from paid expansions. They HAVE TO generate money somehow. The gemstore is entirely optional, it's your choice. It'd be nice to have at least 1 mount skin for each one that is obtainable via gameplay but if you want only 1 skin, you can convet gold into gem and buy it without your credit card. Plus I think that these kind of moans are not justified just now when the whole studio was shot in the legs and they are triying to A) show something to the audience as content, B) convince NCSOFT that they cna make money out of GW2. They are releasing a new epi today that will have a completetly new mastery System with new bosses and new weapons. These are all obtainable via ingame achievements. I don't really see this as a huge issue.   
---
WoW offers mount skins via gameplay. Mind you, those are not the best-looking skins. You still pay every month, it is just reasonable and plausible that they let you earn skins bcoz you have already given them your money steadily, monthly. But there too the best-looking ones are not without charges. In GW you can potentially go and play 8 years of content while paying only 3 times (core, hot, pof).
---
And even more specifically all about ls for the last 3 years.
---
Um, thanks for minimizing the feedback concerns as well as doing some half-assed bullet point display on some of the issues. I mean ffs could you be any more vague with this? Maybe play your own damn game and not provide us a mediocre bullet point list telling us nothing really is going to be updated anytime soon. I honestly don’t understand how they’re not embarrassed with themselves. BASIC expectations for these templates and you not only royally screw it up but you respond to our feedback with this? Just remove this pos from the game until you do your job and implement an actual template. I mean, you had years of a FREE template system to try to replicate to some degree. Jfc
---
Yeah there wasn't a literal disco ball mace, or a bow they shot rainbow unicorns or a great sword that was a window into the universe.
---
The stuffs always been in the game, they just started making it more accessible to drive sales.
---
I get where you are coming from, but this game is cosmetic driven business model and that's the stuff that sells, they aren't gonna hold back for "aesthetic integrity". I'm sure there are many on the devs who feel the same but at the end of the day they need to sell gems.

It's an age-old trope.

A template saves when you want it to so you can apply it again later. Loadouts autosave so any change is immediately baked in so any changes you make are permanently applied to the "template" until you manually undo them.
---
Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time

Meanwhile, that distinction wasn't made in the post I responded to.

Reinstalling graphics drivers would be my first step too.
---
Does it do it in Fullscreen, Window, and Windowed Fullscreen modes?
---
There were flickering issues during loading screens when Windows 10's "Focus Assist" was first introduced, so you could try turning that off.
---
Double-check any addons, overlays, streaming, or metering software that might be running at startup or with GW2.  Try to disable everything like Windows Game Bar, Nvidia FreeStyle, ReShade, Discord, etc.

If you haven't already, two easy things to try would be the -repair [Command Line Argument](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments#-repair) and [clearing your game cache](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5bncp5/psa_dont_forget_to_clear_your_cache/).

Has anyone ever done a study in the effects if internet hyperbole?
---
I'm curious if we test the hypothesis that the more people who spread this silly circle-jerk meme that the game is dying all because they aren't happy with their build templates, the more people actually begin to leave the game.
---
I believed there's a term for the phenomena where a person begins to believe a falsehood is true if they continue to be exposed to it from more than one person/source.
---
And inb4 "they took a break before build templates launched". 1. We don't know that any part of this post is factual, and 2. Doesn't excuse them hopping on the bandwagon. They claim to love the game bbut came back to the sub purely to already negativity. Yeah, I'm not buying it.

Half of these statements are just false or unrelated to your title.

Uhhh... yeahhh, just ignore that guy lol

I recently posted about picking up this game again (*I only played \~30 hours back when the game launched*). I've only played one MMORPG in my life: **PWI** (*heavy p2w game from like 2008 or something*) which I enjoyed and for those who don't know this game.
---
I'm in my mid 30s and I'm looking forward to play GW2 in my spare time but I have a couple of questions:
---
* **Which class is the best for beginners?** Ok, I know you do get this one often and I understand is a matter of preference but I'd like to play a "fun" class (*not incredible mechanically intensive but not the easiest either - for what I read folks that play warrior only have troubles transitioning to other classes due the small amount of skills/spells/rotations that clase have - not sure if this is accurate*) and a class that is really needed in the later stages of the game (*for my experience in PWI those are the tanks and the healers/clerics*) what's the equivalent of those in GW2? - Is that premise valid in GW2 where parties required a tank and healers to complete dungeons? If not which class would be medium difficulty (*as I wont play much I would like the pve content to be as enjoyable as possible and some level of challenge would be great*).  
---
   * If tanks and healers are required and currently meta, are they fun to play in the later stages and can I transition them into pvp?
---
* Is it true that woman gear looks better than dude's? I prefer male characters based on how the armor looks (*medieval type of thing*)
---
* How complicated is to get a guild for casuals (*folks around my age that work and have other responsibilities*) that still uses voice comms and guide newbies like myself?
---
* How's the latin american community in the game (*spanish is my first language*)?
---
* Which class requires the less material's gathering? (*as I wont play often I would love to use my time killing things and leveling not grinding materials*).
---
Thanks in advance for your time again guys, have a good one.
---
I tried the double pistol deadeye build, and can confirm that it should get you through most of the content quite easily - the sustain from the heal on hit is insane!
---
They don't have to use the dragons for that. Most of Elona was explored chasing Balthazar and Palawa Joko. I especially enjoyed everything Joko, the guy had a personality! Also, what 'ton of lore'? That they were around for a long time, have something to do with magical energy, and are necessary for tyrias survival?  That's basically it. Until recently bone of them even had any motivations, and even now it's still bare bones...
---
Look, I'm not looking for Shakespeare here. Nor am I saying that you shouldn't enjoy the dragons. Im saying that the areas we explore are not the result of having dragons, it could very well have been something else. To me, something with a bit more character would have been preferable.
---
It was obvious they werent gonna change the worst part of this update. 
---
Gotta make expansion level monEA.
---
I don't even know why the names are hidden when you can block a person and find their name in the block list.
---
Wasn't Sebulb the main reason for the Quaggan and the Krait displacement?

I really love the meta events in this game and i want to check them all. But afaik there is no meta event timer in game. What is the best strategy if i want to check out all meta events? I got the list of all events from wiki, so i just roam the zones and check if events are available? Are those events can be done solo? I have a few mediocre geared characters.
---
So really it's just more equipment slots

Well it prevents insults and flaming aimed a specific person. Not 100% because you can see the name in the block list but it makes it harder.

Its under 30 Workdays to the point where they close down the studio for the year. Excatly 23 Days with around 8 Hours work per day. What makes under 200hours left for own dev. Its not much time to get it to ship it befor the next year when u want to bring it threw the QA to. Beside there is a episode comming this week. What can lead to alot of bugs and beside that there is still the wintersday left. The pile is hugh to work down in 23Days for around 100peoples . That is probaly the reason why not befor the new year.
---
Pls don’t hurt my feelings

oh man, utopia instead of gw2 would have been awesome. who knows we might still would have gotten gw1 expansions today.
---
Yes! Disco ball roller beetle is what we need!
---
Gotta applaud the effort. It can't be easy to fuck up and/or piss people off every single week. They are following Bethesda's business plan to a T.
---
hihi day 2.
---
wait till u get further ahead its fucking like repeating the fucking thing every got damn day, i gave up at  Riding skyscales, am like whatever at this point.
---
Make sure your laptop is getting proper airflow and isn’t getting too hot. I use speedfan to keep track of internal temps. I have mine on a stand and a cooling pad. For those long or intensive gaming sessions.
---
People been quitting the game since 2012 and will continue to do so. For any number of reasons. Build templates drama is honestly negligible and it's only because there's been nothing else going on. 
---
It doesn't matter for the average new player who comes in to play the game. It does matter to a veteran that's been around for a while. Overall everything is business as usual for a post- expansion lull.
---
Why is it always "if they set a deadline and miss it" or "they don't communicate at all" and never somewhere in the middle?
---
Why is setting a deadline and delivering on that deadline such an unreasonable expectation?
---
&gt; Because we have limited time to program, test, and implement these changes before the winter holidays, we’ll be able to give you a progress update early in the new year.
---
How about you program it, implement it into a PTS and let the community test it. Internal testing within the company is what lead to this disaster in the first place.
---
I am not concerned about the length, I just see these as empty words as they are explanations written on a UI with no interaction on my part. I am not really interested in the story of how BLC got a particular mount skin and I don't consider such stories immersive or lore-friendly. No amount of words on some UI would make the crazy mount skins we have in gem store fit with the game world to me. I actually need to see these creatures in game, or something that resembles them, or at the very least BLC experimenting on mounts to believe they are part of this game.
---
Yes, it released just 2 months ago, so the time window to unlock it for free waas quite small for this one.
---
To be fair, 100,000 salvages is only 300 gold, and I've only salvaged about 150,000 items since the end of 2013. To save bag slots, I just use a Runecrafter's Salvage-o-Matic on everything. It's a waste, but in the grand scheme of things, not that much gold. 6k hours, never had a copper-fed, used to use silver-fed on everything (some salvages lost in net loss lol)
---
Can I only unlock it today? :/
---
Except it still has four wheels and an engine. 
---
Gw1 isn’t open world at all. Can you really call a game a mmo when must form a group in town and zone into a instance to play and while there not see another player? Maybe I’m taking out of my ass here but it was jarring going from playing mmos like galaxies and eq to gw1. 
---
I recall the box for prophecies talking about it being a coop rpg and read an article where the dev stressed it wasn’t a mmo.
---
People are the reason I stopped playing GW2.
---
Same time as always, 8 hours before reset (at least for Eu)
---
That was on purpose.
---
(purpose is money)
---
Well... I mean what we're talking about applies to the build templates as well as the gear templates, and it's not like the loadouts have zero uses so I wouldn't quite say that. They're just not really templates. You could argue the build storage is (ironically the only thing not labelled templates) but there are a bunch of limitations on that.
---
&gt; before it became... you know....
---
What? A good MMO with a lot of content and ongoing open world/story updates that you can still keep playing after having paid once?
---
Did you expect them to?
---
Yes, so... GW1... which has the ability to interact with large amounts of players freely in cities, group up with anyone who is there and then play the game. Is by definition in the massively multiplayer genre. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game
---
Anet also said that Factions and Nightfall weren't expansion packs. Doesn't make it any less correct. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I am not bashing them for wanting to spin it a certain way. But in the same sense as Kojima saying he invented a new genre of game called "strands"  with Death Stranding it doesn't stop it from being an open world action adventure game.
---
Factions and nightfall weren’t expansion. They were complete stand alone games. Lol
---
&gt; my advise is  don't play alone and join up discord. the game doesn't  have hardcore contents for sure but if you are playing with other people  it can be more fun than grinding in other games. 
---
Would do that, but social anxiety gets in the way.
---
that makes sense, i just wish, honestly, that i could actually level my mounts.... that there was more ability to customize what they can do. i wanna be able to spend the time training my skimmer to move as fast as my bunny- at least. it doesn't have to be beetle levels. lol. feel i'm getting into a new topic though.
---
its rough and coarse
---
As some1 said u need 250 of each map currency, and as a guy like me thats playing for like 1 hour daily (mainly pvp), i can only get 5 currency pr. day, good luck getting to 250. just get the currency from early on, dont wait till u get further ahead with ur skyscale guides
---
loved ffxi. had a blast with WoW. starting to have a problem with anet. doesn't mean i'm not a good fit for an mmo, but after blowing 75 bucks on this game.... i'm starting to have regrets.
---
In the story where Lazarus first shows up, he's shrouded in illusion magic shortly before speaking. I wouldn't say it's a bad plot twist when it's been hinted at the moment he showed up.
---
It's just that nobody seemed to notice.
---
I love PvP as it's much more thinking and skill than in PvE.  
---
I DON'T like toxicity, trash talk, and dealing with immature people with ego problems.  
---
This is a big part of the reason why I spend much more time in WvW than in SPvP.  
---
Having your name visible makes it easy for players to whisper you and contact you other ways.  And then some of these players continue to harass you constantly all because you killed them and hurt their ego.
---
As it is, you can discover the names of enemy team as others have explained and that's an exploit that really needs to get fixed.  
---
It's why even in WvW I have to play offline.  I really lost count the number of angry immature people who use the exploit to whisper me otherwise after they die.  Yes...I've also meant a few really cool people who used whispers after a good battle to be friendly and for us to continue in the form of duels.
---
Unfortunately, those few good people are way outnumbered by the immature jerks out there.  So, no, I do not want names to be displayed and furthermore, I want them to fix the exploit so your name is truly hidden.
---
A compromise we can have, however, is an option box for you to display your name to the enemy.  If you want to be "famous" and like trash talk, go for it with that option.  But allow those who just want to play and have fun to continue to stay anonymous.  That's a win-win.
---
yeah which would have lead to no gw2, but instead more gw1 expansions
---
They were stand alone expansions r_r. You could play the expansion solo, but you were heavily limited. It was the same engine, it interacted with the same servers, characters could be carried over and seamlessly between campaigns and the pvp was contiguous between the two. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack
---
see "stand alone expansion pack"
---
**Expansion pack**
---
An expansion pack, expansion set, supplement, or simply expansion is an addition to an existing role-playing game, tabletop game, video game or collectible card game. These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters, or an extended storyline to an already-released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, it may choose to develop the expansion itself, or it may do both. Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the Dragon Slayer games Xanadu Scenario II and Sorcerian.

I was in a similar mindset but once you use the Skyscale, you realise it is worth all the effort. I have barely used any other mount since.
---
It is a good thing it requires so much work otherwise they would be everywhere! Consider it like a legendary mount..
---
Okay, white flag you win.  This conversation is going nowhere. Enjoy your day.
---
They fucked WvW up to monetize it through the mount and then forgot to monetize the mount.
---
This...
---
Your comment just shows me, that you want the attention as well...
---
People are leaving for an understandable reason, so let them do... I can totally understand it at this point of the game
---
And btw...it looks like you wanted to get triggered by any reason
---
I bet there are just a lot of people who downvote after just reading the headline. I don't condone that but there were a *ton* of complaint threads about skyscale for at least a month so I assume some people think "ah shit not again".

Although, the downvotes can happen with seemingly any type of posts so I guess there are simply a bunch of bitter people lurking around here and downvoting stuff.
---
Well, that is dangerous area. It would mean that someone would come up with math what mount is best for everything and people would feel obliged to play this best mount...
---
I think it is now quite healthy mix, each mount does some specific stuff (jackal still has great advantage against raptor if you go through heavy contested areas, as more dodges are worth it all....example - halloween labyrinth race), yet they are partially interchangeabe (for example that springer vs skyscale) and allow you to choose a bit. Even though it usually finalizes on having one mount as default and mainly using that one, but that really depends on keybinds you have for it I guess (I have numpad for all mounts and X for default mount so I definitely use default one more). So far I do use most my skyscale and beetle. Sometimes griffon if I am on specific maps where there is space to fly.
---
But ye, devs really wanted to avoid "now I got X mount , I don't need Y mount anymore ever". And even now those mounts are really powerful, I don't think leveling them further would do good for the game. Still it is brutally nice system compared to the rest of games around. (and who knows, maybe we can get some more mount skills with future masteries, even though Icebrood Saga does not have those in focus *so far* at all)
---
I can hear the sound!
---
Really nice work with the colour!
---
That eye-covered torso doesn't exist in-game, right?
---
If you wish to invest into it...
---
I personally got one (from bitterfrost frontier for berries), as I use same toon for also fractals nad all other stuff, I stuffed it with swim speed infusion to get some swimspeed when moving around bay...technically worth it for long term investment.
---
RemindMe! 3 Months
---
What do I gain from attention? What I want is the hyperbole and negativity to stop. That was quite clear in my post.
---
.... but that's stupid. rather than making it so structured, they should have left it open for personalization- so no mount is better than any other, because you can make a skimmer faster than a beetle. you make them all have that full range, and they're all equal. they may have different skills for different scenarios, but in general, it's all about how hard to work.
---
don't be fooled. they did this so you had to get every mount. it's obvious. it was the profit motive on their side. they want you to spend as much time on this game as possible, and make every step available for whales. the more i read about anet, the more i'm sure of this.
---
[Oh nyooo](https://images.app.goo.gl/smaufdQYxtU5XzuC8)
---
Thanks!
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcH2Cy5dpcc&amp;t=4s) video illustrates pretty clearly how the skyscale is like a helicopter with GTA5 helicopters.
---
Raiders get downvoted for no reason?
---
And you casual white knight reddit guys think you're saving the game...
---
Enjoyable video btw, reminded me on our liquid raid days
---
To me the purpose of build templates is convenience, and having to resort to a workaround because anet gave us loadouts instead of templates defeats that purpose.
---
You are the reason for the negativity as well you smart-ass.
---
Yes, they have been reported.
---
And you by your own logic hopping into a buried thread to throw insults? You didn't have to involve yourself, but here we are. Did you gain what you needed? How precious. Pat yourself on the back baby. You deserve it.
---
The Armor is 'Vestments of the Lich' leggings, and i'm not 100% sure if those are eyes on there, it just always seemed like it to me
---
Ah.. you know that will never happen
---
Also, I kinda disagree.. yeah its annoying, but in their current state, this "templates" are pretty much just inventory space, and they never had those (refering to the bag slots) account wide.. so the logic will be the same. Also a lot of people willl unlock those with gold, so no money made there
---
What I would be happy with, is having the same number of equip and traits unlocked.. is OCD triggering AF having 2 for gear, but 3 for traits.. just give me 3 for both
---
...let's just say i've been on this site for a lot longer than this account has been active, and the response does not seem to fit what i know about reddit. it doesn't seem to fit the predictions at all... 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
add to this that anet is apparently notorious for controlling dissent, calling people that complain "bullies." this thread isn't the first time i've heard about anet censoring criticism..... 
---
you'd think that the biggest forum outside their own would welcome legitimate criticism. you'd think, if the skyscale complaints were that common, they'd sticky a thread about it. but nope.... all skyscale criticism gets downvoted....
---
it is what it is. i'm not saying there's some big conspiracy here- though i'd be curious who the mods are.... i'm just saying it's sad. it defeats the purpose of having this here if negative legitimate opinions from people who paid half a damned paycheck to this game can't get upvotes...
---
Our minds being seemingly stronger seems to have been expanded on with kralk and him losing his mind from having too much magic outside of his domains so that could have been affecting mordremoth.
---
"We saw each other" ... to the bone...
---
Have a good day sir...
---
OP asked for a server with public raids, above average voice participation and skill in pugs...
---
Gandara isnt any of these. Its stacked to the brink with fairweather pugs who somehow all disappear the moment there is opposition.
---
You dont need to pay. Its free. Just test it.
---
If you like pvp and wvw then gw2 isnt worth playing.
---
The combat system  is very good for pvp and wvw. Unfortunately the game focusses on story and trivial gameplay. Challenging content is shunned, competitive content downright hated by carebear players and publisher alike.
---
Pvp is so dead bots will farm top 250 soon.
---
Don't worry about it. I always get downvoted by certain people who see me as a white knight. It's just karma, and therefore meaningless. Not like I can use it to buy a legendary weapon. lol
---
I know but for end game you do. I have played the game but never played till end game. Always been kinda sketchy about it and went back to WoW. Now I am just done with WoW😂
---
Well...the strictness of story is quite balanced out by total non-strictness of everything else. Main story is just single thread in ball of chaos of everything else entangled together, so it really depends on how you play. It certainly makes story development easier when there aren't as many possibilities, but well...maybe it is better than having inconsistencies down the line. 
---
Technically WvW and PvP are still lore-based gamemodes, but only in settings, the gameplay is made that it is players who make stories. And I can assure you that WvW can have great moments, especially when you join voice com and listen to commanders, sometimes the produced stuff is just hilarious. But WvW is really time killer, and best is to have some guild or friends to play with, while regular pvp does have automated queues so is way easier to get into. And after all...one will get some fighting skills and better knowledge about classes in general, it is helpful even for that open world experience or anywhere else.
---
Fractals do have their own ministories, the problem is that without broader knowledge it might be hard to connect those stories to where they belong (for example Siren's reef is just some random pirate guy, until you have been into Lion's Arch and done the pirate Jumping puzzle and met that same guy as ghost there...then it connects into each other )
---
That's a shame. I especially like the competitive part of pvp😅
---
i'm going to be an asshole, and i want you to know i mean it as civilly as humanly possible.
---
fuck you, take that fucking back you fucking asshole! ffxi was perfect! all it needed was a jump button!!!!!
---
really though, even the grind in ffxi didn't feel like a grind... it was an actual challenge. you may be struggling all night for something, but at the end of it, you felt like you earned it. i've never felt that in gw2.... after grinding for hours, and finally getting the thing i wanted so fucking badly...... i just feel empty. like i wasted my time on a fucking skin. in ffxi, you ground out for functionality.
---
The problem is that you started your grind with what is considered by most the most tedious and overcomplicated collection in the game. In general the game is not very grindy, but there are some glaring exceptions.
---
I would suggest you work on other stuff and do the skyscale collection in small bits every day, otherwise you risk burning out.
---
30 bucks for 12-18 months of gameplay, sounds like good investment.
---
It's already bad enough they can whisper you by blocking you every time you catch them with Tainted Shackles and end their suffering before they can run away when their one trick pony gimmick build fails to take you down under 3s.
---
I would make it optional even in PvP.
---
No. It became something it advertised not to be.
---
HAHA I SWUNG A SWORD AGAIN /S
---
THE CHANGES YOU MAKE WILL STAY THERE /S
---
I quit playing not because of the posts here.
---
So did two more of my friends, the last friends I had playing.
---
It's just happening.
---
yea, that seems to be where i'm at. i can't keep spending so much time on this.... i mean, i'm staring at the end of my fun.... actually, that's kinda my point. that's why i'm doing this now. i've got two chars left not 80 and i wanted the scale to enjoy.....
---
....holy shit, there's literally no point in getting this if i can't level the story with it....
---
....i wasted my money......... fucking a.....
---
It is no worth it. The gw2 community is small and the game has serious problems on every end, leave the ship before it drowns.
---
I asked the intended gift recipient if that was something he could use, and he said he didn't have any yet.
---
Well, it would help if the springer doesn't slide for ages downwards if he misses that bulge in the rock, or that one, or this one, or the other one ....
---
This only applies to the gear side, trait side does have templates just a little limited, give us higher build storage and there are the templates. 
---
I feel like this is a bit of nit picky issue the community has come up with, since the issue of changes being saved only really effects the gear side and only if you are using legendaries since if you are experimenting with gear you have whole pieces you are swapping back and forth, it sucks for those that have full legendary sets, they would need to use a loadout for experimenting. Gear templates would be welcome but at the same time I don’t feel it is this big issue people make it out to be.
---
Or they could make more money by adding some, y'know, ingame rewards, creating repeatable content that balances scarcity with steady rewards. Supporting their content creators... So that they would have more players who buy their mount. Lol.
---
Not really no lol
---
The only difference between free and paid accounts in PvP is access to elite specs for each profession.
---
There's plenty of decent builds using only core specs, and they are still working on bridging the power gap there used to be, so elite specs act as sidegrades rather than as upgrade, as that's what's originally intended. Elite specs are meant to give different ways to play the profession, but not necessarily stronger builds.
---
They strayed away from that after expansions, giving too much power to elite specs when they were released, but that started changing right after release and has kept changing ever since.
---
I will give it a try and see what it is like, thank you!!
---
looks great
---
&gt; not set on Tyria but rather within The Mists.
---
This is what I was hoping would happen after Season 4.
---
i'm... not gonna pay for all of living world. that sounds pretty good, but there's no way i'm gonna throw any more money at this game. it just genuinely doesn't feel worth it. i would have rather paid for the full game at the beginning, rather than be baited into this....
---
It couldn't possibly be that he's seen a number of 'should I join?' posts and wants to see numbers grow again. No, there's got to be some magic conspiracy about shilling.   
---
You probably believed in pizzagate, too.
---
Playing meaningless queues for golds and achievements is not what competitive person looks for. GW2 pvp is perfect game for pve noobs who don't like competitive pressure and being rewarded even when losing.
---
The potential of Strike Missions
---
Anet created the strike missions as a stepping stone to raids, a game mode where inexperienced players can jump in, get accustomed to
---
boss mechanics and 10 player squads, improve their combat skill and in the best case scenario awake their interest for more boss fights,
---
for raids. 
---
But what better way would there be for strike missions to prepare for raids than having a raid that is a buffed strike mission? 
---
Currently all 7 existing raids have their own *unique* and gorgous maps. All those maps, as all do, take time to design and create.
---
Based on the first strike mission, the Legendary Icebrood Construct, we have seen that this game mode takes a story map 
---
and turns it into a group content map. Based on what Anet told us it's save to assume that this is their ongoing plan, 
---
story map = strike map. 
---
Now, take this strategy and use it for raids. Use the strike mission map for raid bosses. I think at this point all that raiders want is new bosses. 
---
We just want to smack a hammer on interesting enemies in a shorter interval. Anet propably has their plans with wing 8, so let's talk about wing 9.
---
Anet, take 3 or 4 of the strike mission bosses you have created up to this point that you think has the highest potential for a full fledged raid boss 
---
and make a new raid by resuing the map, reusing models, reusing and adding mechanics. Or fuck it, make a poll. Ask the community what bosses they want to see
---
as raid bosses. All this should drasticly reduce development time for a new raid. Call wing 8 Trials of the North. 
---
One single boss could have: story mode, normal strike mode, strike cm, raid mode, raid cm. If this is not horizontal progression than I don't what it.
---
We killed 3 dragons in the last chapter of each story, so Jormag should be no exeption. Turning Jormag into a strike mission boss sounds great, but what
---
you know what is even better?
---
WING 9! JORMAG, THE ULTIMATE FINAL RAID BOSS!
---
**Strike Missions has the potential to make everyone happy. There is huge potential to cater to every player**
---
The same map, the boss, the same voice acting, optional difficulties.
---
This is not a traditional MMO. Endgame in the GW franchise, 1 and 2, has *always* included things other than raids and dungeons.
---
It doesn't, you can /whisper, type the stuff, then unblock them and then send the message.
---
Yep, they are leaving Netflix in Spring 2020.
---
"The potential of..." is the most repeated thing about GW2 since 2012. How many potential content we had already? Nothing is being supported long enough and neither will be strike missions. They will be either easy or abandoned by anet soon.
---
Takes a lot of development time.and probably not worth it in their eyes for the relatively small increase of purchases. Might be cool, but doesn't make enough money vs effort when most ppl would just buy them outright anyway.
---
Nagennif is correct, though. ANet's endgame design is pretty literally 'what you do when you're done leveling', including new zones, living world episodes, achievement hunting, exploration, collections, fractals, etc. This has been the case since GW1. 'Raids' wasn't even considered 'endgame' for about half of this game's lifecycle and dungeons were abandoned pretty early on.
---
Mind you that not all skyscale criticism gets downvoted, at the beginning they were pretty much the top posts but after a while they started just repeating each other without adding anything new.
---
Also it's not only criticism that gets downvoted, there are plenty of "I'm new and liking the game" threads that sit at 0 as well.
---
Well, that's on you. It is just 80 gold (when without discounts) for one epizode, once you don't save up for mounts, it is easy to save up for them. After a while, one can easily get like 20-30gold per hour, meaning getting one epizode unlocked per day...Yes, this conflicts with other account upgrades one would want to get....but the idea is, that if you actively play, you get epizodes for free. It definitely sucks for newcommers, yea...
---
I've mostly been playing RuneScape (RS3, although OSRS is great as well, but don't have time for both haha). I made an ironman account about a year ago when I was growing bored waiting between living world updates, and has since become my main game.  
---
Path of Exile looks great as well, especially with the upcoming sequel. It's a good game I only stopped playing because having to hold the mouse button to move around was bothering my finger, but I might give it another try.
---
I'm mostly curious about if people would feel if this is more ethical.
---
You would have saved enough money to buy copper fed by now, if you havent paid 57 copper premium on every item salvaged so far. With current prices, 800 gems = 310g = 54k salvages until break even. So you are a little bit over 600 gold loss so far from not using copper, + the copper fed kit  itself.
---
You didn't thank the guy you gave that response to, wherein you suggested that you having asked your friend would somehow make the gift option appear in the game 🤷‍♂️
---
Let me clarify. I play all of the above content. CM fractals, PvP, WvW, meta events, even player-to-player trading.
---
I have thousands of hours each in dozens of online games. Guild wars 2 is by far one of the least toxic environments.
---
I really don't think you understand just how toxic the average online game is. In online gaming, the friendliness of the community is measured by how toxic it *isn't*. There is definitely toxicity in Gw2, but it is not on the same level as pretty much any other online game.
---
Now, PvP? that's not a fair comparison. But yes, actually. PvP in Gw2 is less toxic than PvP in other PvE-centric games (Destiny 1 &amp; 2, Diablo II and Runescape in particular come to mind).
---
The meta is a lot more definined now for each class/activity (raids, fractals, pvp, etc).
---
But yes go full zerk and you will do okay.
---
If you want to look at specific class builds, I would suggest reading here: https://snowcrows.com/raids/
---
Awesome. I like seeing more diversity in builds. But fractals is different then normal pve/raid builds?
---
A billiion downvotes and arguments against it since 2015. They'd rather strangle the gamemode to death than to share it with undeserving, filthy, entitled, toxic casual plebs.
---
Same with WvW, by the way, but that's another topic.
---
I see we've reached the pathetic "silently downvote and ignore instead of addressing the argument" stage. OK then, until next time.
---
Singleplayer games might be a better category for you.
---
Sort of?!
---
The meta has expanded in which more professions have more options at their disposal. If you want to go Direct damage then you will not see much of a difference other than having maybe a slight difference in gear but there are also condition, support and heal builds.
---
That, however, all depends on the game mode you play and which role you want to fill. Direct damage builds have, in most cases, the advantage because they don't need to ramp up their conditions stacks and only need those Buffs that other, support, professions or their own build provide. That is why they are constantly in the Meta. If there is a boss with incredibly high armour and no hard phases in which conditions can't be re-applied or removed then COndition builds could be better in that scenario.
---
q.e.d.
---
The PvP in Gw2 is like AB and that's pretty much it. Different maps but only cap and defend with some map specific mechanics. WvW is the other form of PvP wich is kinda like AV but you can cap and recap and it lasts a full week. PvP is kinda dead from what I read around. WvW is alive depending on the server but camps with huge balance(population) issue's. Like others said the base game is free to play but the WvW is locked behind a certain level and I'm not sure if PvP is locked until a certain level. I like casual pvp in WoW but hate it in Gw2. I did like WvW but haven't touched it in a long time since it feels empty often.
---
like I said, not 100% but it makes it harder.
---
You seem to hate other players very much, so why play with others?
---
PvP is only one of ways. Doing daily fractals is way more profitable (like 20-30gold per hour just for running 3 daily fractals) if you do it reliantly (best on T4 to claim all dailies at once and best best with some perma group of friends of guildies so you don't need to rely on lfg). Raids do have also nice value of rewards but those are waym ore time consuming and do rely on quite a bunch of work to get prepared.
---
Dailies do give 2 gold per day. Can take 5-10 minutes. can be done in Pve, WvW, PvP so there is plenty of trivial tasks to choose from (kill 3 people in pvp, get vista, daily miner...it is basically free gold). Tequatl gives 2 gold per day. PvP gives gold. Daily anomaly boss gives 1 mystic coin (1,5 gold) and 50 silver trash guaranteed, so another 2 gold value boss. Doing HoT or PoF meta events grants Hero's choice chests once per day (one per Verdant brink, Auric basin, Tangled depths, Dragon Stand, Casino Blitz in Amnoon, Augury Rock in riverlands, Maw or Junundu in desolation, and Vabbi) which you can choose Amalgamted gemstone from, this is worth over gold and either can be sold or you can store it for crafting legendary weapon if you like. 
---
Nobody says you have to do them every day or all of them, but if you happen to be online and don't have anything to do when those things happen...it is worth it to check them out sometimes and get that coins. Over time it accumulates. There is definitely a lot of value in playing many parts of the game. 10g you claim you got is 5x daily login and 10 minutes of play (if you go for that dailies). You even can get more by stripping in Divinity's Reach, probably :D
---
But...you also get huge values of materials. Those are best valued as materials you can use into crafting (for example to get ascended set or stuff for collections etc) so you don't need to use gold to buy from market, while it can also be sold if you have excess...your main gold intake from open world and such will be from this. However this value is very much hidden in your bank and it won't reflect into your gold wallet so you can easily forget about it. Even just daily login chests do have god value (especially mystic coins). If you are interested in how much value you have in what, you might want to check out gw2efficiency.com and put there your API key so it can read your account public info, it is very nice tool. You can even enable farming tracker so you can see how much stuff you got over one gaming session, you can search for missing skins or there is crafting optimizer...
---
I just don't believe you just got 10g from 10 months of play. I bet 10g that you have at least 200 gold of value in your material storage and you don't even know about it xD
---
If you are actually good, especially if you are a commander, the enemies will know your name.
---
If you are a random thief teabagging people after sniping them in their Zerg builds trying to get back to the tag or something equally skilled, people wont care quite as much about you.
---
Mounts are not skin, each mount are different with a different purpose. Each mount have their own engage skill as well. Mounts in other games such as WoW and FF are just a speedbuff in form of a skin. And yet you feel more rewarded for a skin that speedbuff you instead of a real mount that have a purpose. 
---
And let us talk about rep grind. Tbh i don't know much about FF and repgrind but most of the other old MMO have this. It is a endless grind that goes on for ever to get reputation to be able to by that bis thing that will get you 10 more dps in the newest raid. You do grind and grind and grind because you must have this because your raidleader said you do or you wont get a spot in the raid, and now you have it WOHOO!!! 5 months later it is worth horse shit because a new map comes out and they have a rune that does 20 more dps and loads of fireresistance and you need to grind for the reputation to get it.
---
Now i understand if you don't like GW2, that is ok, but telling me that you grind in GW2 when it really is about a few days and you get a new mount who is more then a speedbuff is burning you out, then i don't really understand what it is you try to say.
---
Yes, the metas on PoF are pretty shitty, but looks like bounties saved the day. Most PoF maps are still populated because of countries and, if you ask nicely, they will help you with some metas too. Yesterday I needed Augury Rock opened for my skyscale and the local bounty train  came in and helped me.
---
You are welcome. Hope you have fun!
---
Ye, but still, over time it is losing battle with laptops, because be honest, who lets their laptop to be cleaned inside at least once a year? Practically nobody. It is way easier with table pc :)
---
I will see if I can do something about it.
---
Well a few silly things here and there is pretty different from the current state of things. Of course I wonder to what degree it was inevitable for a lot of players to pick up legendaries just given enough time... but if it was just say legendary weapons and a small handful of others that were all glow-y (infinite light), that would still be a different story from having infusions, backpieces and armour/outfits that are as OTT as now.
---
A pile of random players from early days and a pile from now would look *extremely* different.
---
they worked 1 year twice =D
---
Its pink armor - ascended. You can craft it - which is the most reliable way to get it if you are not doing high tier fracs daily/weekly raid clears.  
---
You also only need ascended armor for fractals. For raids having just ascended trinkets and weapons is good enough. Armor provides something like a 4% damage boost compared to exotic. The biggest difference is the trinkets.
---
\-i think you should pick that class that you like ideawise. for pve measures only, all classes are equally good i'd say.   
---
i started warrior, still my main but i play more engineer bc engi has tons of stuff that i did not test out yet fully. got a ranger too but ranger is totally not my style, sometimes fun tho. 4th char is a renegade, not bad or unfunny but also not precisely my favourite kinda char.  
---
\-male armor doesn't look bad. female armor just looks, partly pretty good. it's like guys playing with dolls kinda i guess :)
---
\- rather easy to get any guild, for getting a good one its about looking around. you have more guild slots anywise... big and active would be the best for guilds. probs best near capitals and starting areas to be found or at big meta events with many people.  
---
\-theres a big WvW server (word vs world, meaning server vs server kinda) where in EU spanish people have big frequency (baruch bay), therefore i'D say yes, enough latin ppl around.
---
\-all classes require materials i fear. but technically u can go around crafting for quite some time, just at a point u might miss it.
---
lemme put it this way for ya.... 
---
in ff, my favorite char was a prestige class. i fought for longer on that one char, just to get it to 50, than i've played on this game in the last, almost a year. every step of the way felt like an achievement. every level felt earned. when i finally got to 50, i had to grind out a hundred kills with a certain shitty weapon after completing the quest, just to get that class- and the kills in that game were much more skill oriented and difficult. when i finally got that class.... it rewrote my char. my old class was gone, and i was adapted to the new one. my dark knight is still my favorite mmo char... because i freaking earned that shit. it wasn't a slog, it wasn't easy, and if anything it was meticulous- not tedious. 
---
that's the kind of thing you grind for in ffxi. you grind because you're not good enough, and in the end, what you get sticks with you. it's always awesome. it was always worth it.... most of the grinding in that game was the same sort. you fight and struggle to get something worthwhile, and if you mess up... well, better try again later. 
---
i don't get that same feeling of deserving what i get here... it's like most of what i do, is just point and click a thousand times....
---
I sent them a pack of salt per mail and then instantly block em. This way they have to remove it from their mail and can't sent it back.
---
Imagine asuran architecture but with stepped sides, enjoy
---
Nowadays you can get ascended by many ways:
---
* super rare loot - world bosses, reward tracks, basically anything though.
---
* crafting
---
* playing pvp -&gt; buying from pvp vendors for pvp tickets
---
* playing wvw -&gt; buying from wvw vendors for wvw tickets
---
* playing raids -&gt; buying from raid vendors for raid magnetite shards or direct drops
---
* playing fractals -&gt; buying from fractal vendors for fractal tokens or direct drops
---
* doing certain achievements and collections
---
* playing living world maps -&gt; buying from vendors for special map currencies (mainly trinkets, rings, amulets, backpieces)
---
* some are buyable with laurels
---
don't get catched by anet devs with that illegal frog.
---
They could, but they won't with the nature of the current playerbase where raiders are already claiming that Strike Missions both aren't for them and also the content they should have and that it should cater to them.
---
The correct solution has always been something similar to Strike Missions (to reuse story assets) *and* variable raid difficulties to allow for a sense of progression and to allow greater differentiation between multiple difficulties. Ideally this would be through an easier mode that gives less rewards but is still more challenging than strikes - since if you want to progress on a boss it's better to learn a toned down version of the fight than do something totally different that is easy. Additionally, some sort of repeatable CM system would add a lot more replayability.
---
This is how other games extended their content with Mythic and Savage modes which aren't just a once and done.
---
Meanwhile, Strike Missions should continue to cater to absolute entry level players and have challenge modes for more experienced players (perhaps limiting the fight to a far smaller number of players, increases damage output, no downstate etc). As it is, the gulf between Strike Missions and Raids is still too great.
---
yeah i know the gw2 ones. i watch only wp from time to time and maybe he is the best gw2 content creator.
---
One thing - the F2P has restrictions in order to keep spammers, gold sellers away.
---
But.. but.. thats the scythe and gravedigger is a greatsword skill! But nah thats really cool art!
---
Wrong. Raids were figured out long ago, very close to the release of raids. The community didn't get better in the last few years, in fact I'd argue it got worse. What did happen is HARD power creep, especially in the healing department. 
---
For example, greens on VG had to be either dealt with mechanically or distorted because you couldn't out heal it back then (had to run two druids who had to spec for Grace of The Land, spirits were 5 man and etc.). But now you just brute heal your way through it. Just a very basic and simple example, there're many more some for 10 man buffs and boons, some for healing and dps.
---
Sounds like a scrapper could do it between bulwark toolbelt, toolkit 4, hammer 2, and hammer 4
---
pretty much yeah. and now that dulfy quit that leaves only wp.
---
Well kind of. Main idea of "kill before get killed" is still same, that's why the meta was and is still about big damage, because for defenses you can use dodges, movement, blocks, special skills, and so on. That means you have to get good at the game to actually be able to sruvive, as your gear is not helping you with it, but that's it. Dead enemy does not bite.
---
In teamplay scenarios, things changed very much and they do still change based on latest balance patches.
---
Necro, Thief, Warrior and to a lesser extend guardian have top tier builds that don't require any expansions. ([source](https://www.godsofpvp.net/))
---
I have also seen core Mesmer and core Ranger (i.e. no expansions required) that performed well, but they are for the most part one trick pony builds. This leaves only Engineer and Elementalist seem noticeably weaker without elite specialisations and Revenant which is not available at all for people without expansions. I don't play Engi or Ele (so I don't have personal experience), but playing an off-meta build that noone has seen in a long time can prove to be effective since you can catch people by surprise. It won't bring you to the top 50, but it can get you into platium if you are skilled enough.
---
If you want to look for builds you should check [metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest)
---
They run their game on metrics. It's a business and a service. We can all demand things we want, but their financials will guide their activities much more than anything else. The crowd who have gone without for a long time are just so minor in this game. Thatd why they focus on the content that that do. It's the stuff that is enjoyed by the masses.
---
With HoT they already designed good bosses : Blademaster Diarmid, Axemaster Hareth, Stavemaster Adryn.  
---
I still don't know why they didn't made a raid about the mordrem guard. Assets already created, a lot of attacks, ....  and we can find other examples.  
---
I hope that strikes will be a good progression ladder that lead to raids, just give different difficulty as fractals, slow the punishes mechanics, put different cd on mechanics so they don't overlaps, ... but to be honnest i don't see why strikes will not waste its potential as everything already did.
---
Didn't druid have way more healing on release?I remember them tuning it down pretty hard at some point.
---
Here's the deal, if I was to cite who gave me what information it might jeopardize the relationship. Also, thats exactly how information works if youve ever read a newspaper. The reporter (me) builds up a history of being right and doing good reporting, and then when the reporter says that his sources tell him something, people give it more credence due to the credibility the person has established. This is me telling you what I've been told by people who know, not a random anonymouse reddit account bullshitting, and there is a huge difference between the two.
---
The meta actually changed to Condi for a while when Hot released. Some content was still berserker though of course. Since then, as the other person said, there's a lot more diversity. It also fluctuates more with balance patches now as well.
---
The manifesto truely aged like milk...
---
They had higher base healing, which meant you could run almost full DPS and get away with it. 
---
If I'm not mistaken, they changed it so that you had more healing overall, but you had to spec healing stats.
---
I was primarily a WvW player for the first few years of the game, then I just logged for expansions and new Living Stories. Now I don't even have the game installed anymore.
---
&gt; They could, but they won't with the nature of the current playerbase where raiders are already claiming that Strike Missions both aren't for them and also the content they should have and that it should cater to them.
---
Well those people don't undertand that strike missions are literally being advertised as beginner content. If you ever killed a raid boss, strike missions are not for you. I have all raid achievements and I have killed the icebrood construct every time I logged in because I like it. 
---
But the point of my post is to unify those two groups. The experienced players can join the inexperienced ones, just like in the current strike missions where 3k dps reapers play along with 20k dps firebrands. Future raids can be turned into being simply the next direct difficulty step, a level up. Do not change mechanic wise what a raid is, just put them into strike missions as the next difficulty step.
---
¨They have all the tools, they just need to...¨ is the fucking history of this game. We had the tools for constant permanent updates, we had the tools for interesting world boss fights, we had the tools for new metroid-esque skills unlocks and long term experience sinks, we had the tools for good storty telling, we had the tools for game balance, we had the tools for challenging 5 and 10 man content, we had the tools for rewarding questlines.
---
Another great idea that will be left in the dust because anet is a great innovator, not a great refiner of ideas.
---
Maybe in some hours you can buy the bug fix for some gems
---
That is not true. We surely have issues of people disappearing, but not with appearing opposition, but typically with OVERWHELMING opposition. Like when we face WSR. Huge zergs, not utterly stupid when it comes to fighting, leading to being steamrolled. When there are fights to be had, we'll have them. Look for open Raids with a Meta core. (Meta as in the guild). Look for Raids of OURS, typically also open, even more relaxed.
---
Good to know that you're not actually crazy. Strike Missions, or at least that one that exists right now, are great for the vast majority of player. Just the right amount of challenging for the general open world player with his shaman's geared rifle engineer. But it's not content for people that look for a raid-tier challenge and beyond, because, let's face it, raids aren't difficult for that (tiny) part of the playerbase.
---
And unless Anet and their "challenging content" crowd suck it up and add additional difficulties, that shit will never fly.
---
&gt;don't get ~~catched~~ **caught** by anet devs with that illegal frog.
---
FTFY
---
The difference is that now that are activly reusing assets for a new game mode, now they only have to go one step further.
---
Those aren't even the worst offenders. They take ages to find but if that's just a "&gt;=" to change into a "&gt;", the correction at least is quick. The worst is when you take hours/days to find the cause, and you discover that to correct it you'd need to change pretty much everything because the issue lies within the conception itself.
---
wait i just bought the pof bundle do I have this?
---
Good work, love necro art! I need to get some of my necro sometime.
---
They probably can't give a progress update because there won't be much, if any, progress until next year in actual development. The studio will be low on staff for the next couple of months and they already probably have everything planned out for the holidays. This is how it is at my office anyways.
---
Excellent idea. Let's give it a try.
---
 Pretend I'm a new player like my SO and I want to try making my first legendary. I made the jars and beat the boss. The Jars discription says use after defeating the boss, so that simple enough. Now the description just says distill at a place. How does one do this? Let's check the wiki: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Distilled_Essence_of_Zhaitan
---
Ok great. No mention on how to distill. Awesome.
---
If I'm roaming and fighting near water and need to kite through the water and you can't chase me because your build has no mobility and I'm on a "run away" build that just sounds like an issue with your build not mine tbh.
---
The game is leaning towards  death a.k.a. maintenance mode.
---
&gt;Like all F2P games with an in-game shop, you will be tempted via them selling you massive power and efficiency gains, so avoid at all costs if you're the kind to get suckered in to that kind of thing.
---
Is there any power gain even available in the gem store? And i feel like the only efficiency thing is infinite salvage kits which reduce the salvage price per item from like 3.5 to 3 coins. Isnt gem store exclusively qol and visuals?
---
&gt;Competitive gameplay you shall find none of here. As with all F2P games, bots and hackers and toxicity abound in competitive areas.
---
Why do you have such a massive hate against f2p games? Not that guild wars is one of course. From my experience its not the f2p that generates toxicity but the competitiveness...
---
&gt;This game weirdly parades around that it has a 'great community' , yet if you actually play the game you see nothing of the sort, which is weird considering they've done their best to try and make the game essentially a single player RPG. The phrase i've heard a lot is 'playing alone, together' - which leads people very rapidly into the mindset of 'get out of my way.' Ever seen how people turn into animals and start acting in a train station? Thats what i'm talking about. Get out of my way, your existance is a waste of my time.
---
Maybe you are still talking about pvp here, but the pve community is really great. Maybe this is a eu/na thing but in around 2000 hrs of gameplay, endless zergs and random lfg parties i had no big negative experience. People are so nice, its hard for me to believe this is an online videogame. Maybe this is a mmo thing with people being older and stuff and you are just uses to it, but comparing mobas and counterstrike to gw is like night and day.
---
&gt;there really honestly is absolutely no reason to join a guild... in guild wars 2.
---
If you really thing guild wars is named guild wars because of a focus on guilds, i refuse to believe you have 4000hrs in this game lol.
---
I wanted to actually learn the full story about the dwarf race but playing it! To see what actually went wrong , I know that it was because of a dragon awake but seems such an empty answer. Watching it in a dungeon or raid would be good. 
---
Also playing in Orr before it's destruction, to have an idea how glorious it was, and witness it's fall. 
---
Jade sea would also be good! 
---
All the past stories :D

---
It's basicly about cutting dev time on new raids by merging them into strike missions into a game mode that offers content for every type of player.
---
 Yes, I did not take old raids into concideration but honestly, I don't see Anet changing anything related to w1-7 but I'd be happy if Anet proves me wrong.
---
Jormag has ALWAYS done this, though. This is what people seem to forget. There's a hero point challenge in core tyria where Jormag (or MAYBE an entity associated with it) is directly telling you to succumb to Dragon's power and you get the hero point by defying it and killing the icebrood that exit and IIRC it says something to the effect of approving of how strong you are. Personally, I love this. I hope that some of this season is dedicated to the unique position the Svanir have as willingly corrupting themselves and what insights they might have into Jormag.
---
Legendary armour fix would like to have a word.
---
Yes, I agree that reusing assets is a good part of strikes. However, the same logic should also be applied to raids as an easier difficulty will make the content approachable to more players and repeatable CMs means we don't have situations where more complex encounters are generally limited to one and done fights.
---
I don't understand your first response. The latter two sentences are contradictory. Would you mind clarifying? I presume you actually mean that they aren't *targeted* at you?
---
If you want a unification to occur, you need variable difficulties over both raids and strikes, not just the latter.
---
Yeah, I'd be totally for something like the merging of Strikes and raids as you describe but the player base isn't going to be unified by that. You need raids to offer variable difficulties too as well as a hook to keep more experienced players engaged by actually making CMs worth repeating.
---
If the argument for Strikes is cutting dev time by reusing assets, then surely that argument also applies to reusing current raids simply with a lower difficulty toggle and changing the reward structure for current CMs.
---
Original Reddit comment, EA bad, it would have been so wholesome if Keanu had developed build templates instead
---
Exactly my thought.
---
I mean the the raid community. You can't say that the newer wings were cleared faster because the players were better and not the power creep. If you want a more concrete proof, when people just started to ask 50li for VG I remember many people saying that's crazy, that you don't need that much exp and that it's an overkill. Now, 250li groups wipe on it. Even with the power creep. That would've been unimaginable back then
---
I was refering more to your weapon selection.
---
Ah, unlike GW2
---
BUILD TEMPLATES BAD, DED GAME, WHY NECRO NERF??
---
It took a lot less time for me to type "quit" than you apparently spend being so grumpy about a video game.
---
Quit
---
I do not play WoW or FF but to me gear progression sounds like artifical difficulty. If the only thing stopping you from killing a boss are the numbers on your weapon and not how you use your skills then it it's not the raid that is difficult, it's the game design that is bad.
---
The next 2 years are safe, so... no. 
---
But hey, "the game is dying"™ since releasy. ;)
---
Yeah. "Slap MOAR ZEROS ON THE HEALTH BAR" is not interesting gameplay. I remember at least once playing Destiny (Not raids, but something else, I forget what) and it basically devolved from fun gunplay and movement to "Pop out, drill specific spot on badguy, hide until it was visible again." because the health was so insanely high compared to my damage output. 
---
Other games have suffered this as well. Just artificially inflating health/damage numbers instead of making it actually challenging. The whole item level about WoW I hear lately just sounds... blah. Like you'll never hold onto a great looking and stat item for long, always replacing gear. As soon as the new update hits all your gear is invalid and you gotta grind up a new set.
---
I won't say GW2 has it perfect, but I enjoy being able to jump in and just play after a long break, knowing my gear is at least solid, even if I have to relearn skills a bit.
---
Outgearing sounds horrible. As if every shit player can beat anything because his gear is good.
---
&gt; I think in order to have raids and have them be interesting for the casual and hardcore alike,
---
Easy mode, normal mode, challenge mode. Done.
---
I have been playing for a while and I might be burnt out, sure. My experience from other games, however, instinctually warns me to stay away from Gw2 because of the monetization methods and frequency + lack of in-house game plan.
---
As of yesterday. Rev is still fucked
---
Isn't this a problem of absolutely every competitive game out there?
---
A very high skilled player will almost always stomp players of lower skill. 
---
And unless you have huge population and activity, you are likely to end up in unbalanced games from time to time, and depending on the population it will be either often, or rare occasion, and there is only so much that an algorithm can do to balance it out.
---
The 2nd gen legendary greatsword turns into a scythe while using gravedigger. Although this specific scythe doesn’t look like that sword
---
&gt; They literally said "early next year" plus we all know that this year is over in like 3 weeks, because Winter Holidays.
---
That was "early next year" before they even have an informational update, not that they'll have anything actually changed early next year.
---
It’s on the table
---
T1 is not related to skill level nor quality of zerg fights, but the amount of siege monkeys or just a lot of active people in general.
---
&gt;They'd rather strangle the gamemode to death than to share it with undeserving, filthy, entitled, toxic casual plebs.  
---
ah yes, the multiple raid training guilds definitely prove that people hate casuals, raiders hate casuals who put in 0 effort an expect to get carried
---
Downvoted for saying just straight facts. Whiteknights get extra pathetic during new content days.
---
&gt; i've got two chars left not 80 and i wanted the scale to enjoy
---
Tbh I enjoy exploration a lot more with my griffon and beetle than with skyscale. Of course skyscale offers a lot of convenience and I like that mount a lot, but there is some skill involved in flying the griffon or rolling with the beetle at max speed which I find a lot more entertaining. The way I see it, the expansion maps are where the skyscale shines due to their verticality. For core Tyria maps it is mostly a mount that is simply nice to have imo.
---
I can understand your frustration, you didnt waste your money.
---
First of all you can still get your skyscale, just take it slow and dont burn yourself out. Do some part of the skyscale collection, then level your alt, then back to skyscale etc.
---
Also the LS4 maps offer other things aside from skyscale, so your money is not wasted. Sandswept Isles and Dragonfall have ascended trinkets, Beetle mount is from one of the LS4 episodes, Diviner stats can be crafted with recipies bought from another LS4 episode, some maps have profitable meta events (even after the nerfs some still give good gold per hour), there are also armour skins, ascended backpacks etc. 
---
Maybe those things by themselves are not enough of a reason to buy the episodes, but since you bought them already you might as well take advantage of what they offer.
---
Far Shiverpeaks has its fame. It will last 5 Weeks and then Siverpeaks goes down to t5 again because Underworld is hard carrying them and they just had to fight mostly national servers now with a bad coverage and/or bad linking servers.
---
As a launch player returning you have no idea how much I appreciated those videos binge watched them all
---
As we say down in the south: "this is a big pile of nothin'!"
---
Make no mistake, I love arenanet and their developers are more passionate than I have seen, but this doesn't cut it. As our brothers up in Washington would say: "Get it on!"
---
I am confident that the next iteration of build templates will satisfy us in the community, but the resources has to be committed from the higher ups!
---
That's not even the comment I was talking about. Either way, it's irrelevant. I'm sorry if my assumption was wrong, but people that aren't actively involved in a comment chain seldom bother to read this far, let alone downvote a single comment, whereas it is extremely common for people to downvote and not respond further once they can't adequately address the arguments presented (or they're just bored and tired, who knows). That's where my assumption was coming from; I don't give a shit about the downvote itself.
---
Take a look at the guild discord of the guild "farm" they have great tools to see what map brings exactly how much money, they also organize daily farm trains.
---
Its a problem exclusive to wow. Blizzard balances their highest difficulty at the time of release around top guilds and often go overboard.
---
This is true except for ultimate difficulty encounters, which no amount of overgearing is going to help you with if you couldn't clear it on release.
---
Post your armory.
---
I raided in WoW for years, including in serious progression guilds and raids absolutely require a degree of skill. While the raids are definitely made easier by better gear, you don't go into raids in WoW in BiS gear like in Guild Wars 2 and much of the skill is in how a team accounts for being undergeared through particularly strategies, when CDs are used, how the healing is conducted and all players minimising damage on themselves through execution of mechanics.
---
you don't get notified of anything unless you are on latest story step and you get prompted to start playing the Bound by Blood episode.
---
just logging in period between the access window between bound by blood's release and the next episode (which comes/came out today) will unlock the episode for you when you are ready to play it.
---
I sure would. The LFG works fine, but I forget to look into content, or don't want to make a party if there isn't one in the LFG already for older stuff.
---
Sorry for late reply - the hole to break under the map is above the tengu wall, you can get there if you climb the highest point on the rocks around dreamdark enclave and use griffon.
---
If your actual skill rating is high then of course games under plat are not competitive **for you**, because you can stomp the other team consistently.
---
If however your skill rating is lower, then you will find competitive games in lower tiers until you can git gud and roflstomp everyone below plat.
---
Just because a basketball player doesnt play in a team that participates in Euroleague or NBA finals, doesn't mean that he is not entering competive championships etc
---
if they change randomly, sometimes you might end up with them randomly choosing the good position.
---
Yesterday was your lucky day
---
Gotcha, I'm based in south America so I supposed I need to play in NA servers to avoid lag. About the materials, I guess I want to start with a HA user as I read it less time consuming to get the materials needed for those, idk?
---
/u/XiahouMao got you covered for the most part, but I just wanted to add that beyond Hero Point Trains in the LFG, there are guides on the easiest soloable Hero Points without needing certain masteries or whatever over on dulfy.net. She's basically retired from guides and stuff, but her guides are accurate and those ones helped me get alts taken care of easily.
---
Since you just got the expansions I would work on Path of Fire (2nd expansion) first at least just to get a mount for faster moving around.   Once you do that work through both expansion stories and get hero points to progress on your elite specialization.  You will want them as soon as you can because there is a pretty big jump in DPS for most professions over a non elite spec.
---
As someone who did skyscale before they made it less time-gated, be glad you don't have to wait for each reset to continue.  That being said the collection is a bit of a slog but I do understand why they made it like that given the sheer number of complaints launched at ANet regarding the Inquest Golem backpack collection/questline from A Bug in the System / Sandswept Isles.  The longest thing by far to cover is the 250 of each map currency thing as some of the currencies are a bigger pain to get than others.  I would say to just include those maps as part of your daily routine rather than grind the living hell out of each.  It'll seem less like a grind that way.
---
I will say that I use skyscale a fair bit, mostly as a springer/raptor hybrid for when i need to get vertical or cover a short distance before dismounting.  Griffon is really only useful when you are already in a high altitude place to begin with so Skyscale has the more jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none thing going for it.  Griffon's main requirement is 250 gold as the rest of the collection line is relatively easy.  Skyscale requires i think 40 gold total to get the saddle, more than that if you want to skip a bunch of the puzzle/event requirements in other collections leading up to it.
---
Mythic raids in WoW are just really difficult because of layered mechanics. Even with max gear.
---
Lol wtf. Are you delusional? When was the last time you played WoW, Vanilla back in 2005?
---
Mythic raids require lots and lots of whole team (all 20 people) coordination, with potential to fully wipe from just 1 person's mistake, literally. And not just team coordination, but plethora of personal skill is required, all on top of doing exceptional dps (meaning executing spell priorities perfectly, not just obtaining gear) or healing or tanking.
---
If this means they'll feel more free to communicate, then I'm all for it.
---
Fair enough.  I like some of the CS ones that seem somewhat randomly generated.
---
they plan to go even deeper into loot boxes, rng, p2w and want to hide who they are so people will not connect that shitty things with their names
---
You know, you don't have to put your broom and chairs in shared inventory slots.  That's what the [Novelties](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Novelty) pane is for.  Not sure why you'd put a mini there either.
---
......and it still doesn't even display the skin on your skyscale
---
You are probably right ye
---
Yea I don't understand why there is even a right click-&gt;block option for enemies in WvW. Why would you need to block them if they can't get their name in the first place? The only way they can get your name is if they block you with that option? It defeats its own purpose.
---
I like the cartoony feel of the look.
---
Sounds good to me! Not all of us can play nice.
---
the ppl who decide that are usually not posting on the forums.
---
I guess they're not going to say who's who and we'll have to search and identify them, so we'll have more trouble saying XXX dev did good or bad.
---
The arena isn't a paid function, the additional slots for templates are paid. Thus it has a wayyyyy higher criticity in the incident backlog
---
Well.. all of the information you have supplied is incredibly easy to actually find and thus it shouldn't be used as a guarantee that you are actually the rightful owner of the account.
---
dying from being killed then ?
---
Thank you...Butterfly Kingdom. I guess?
---
hmm,its official forum,you shoud be able to tell,whos giving you information.
---
I don't have any advice for you, except keep providing any details you can remember.  Wouldn't hurt to post this to GW1 reddit, as the process might be slightly different and there are still people active over there.
---
Not surprising and good. Also, the Guild Wars 1 subreddit is pretty active.
---
Give this a read as to why they are hesitant to provide access, it's pretty easy to social engineers: https://massivelyop.com/2019/10/10/guild-wars-2-studio-arenanet-chased-the-2016-gaile-gray-account-hacker-all-the-way-to-germany-and-lost/
---
Am I the only one that's glad they won't jut hand over my account because they have my name, birthday and address?
---
As it should have been from the start.
---
We don't really need to know people's names. Perfectly fair to leave it up to the dev if they don't want to put it out there for Googlability or whatever.
---
On the day they released this chair I saw someone with it in the Aerodrome and got super excited to see the other mount sit animations. Wanted to check on reddit how to use those, oh well
---
&gt; when posting on the forums or communicating with players
---
Did i miss something?
---
Dince when does this happen?
---
You can, by whatever name they choose to use.
---
They should use each other's names instead.
---
I can see why they would do this. Let's hope it makes them feel more comfortable to talk about stuff now.
---
If ANet and the community are nudging devs to communicate more, it's a fair concern.
---
Seems reasonable, since this community likes too much to stalk devs on social media.
---
It just stroke me that my twenty PoF mastery points will be useless this time around and I'll start without any point. Hopefully there will be enough to unlock all the masteries.
---
And i thought for one second it means they gonna clear out all the mods in the forum and getting better ones that dont ban everything they dont like.
---
Oh, good to know that bugs are only fixed if it’s a bug with a gemstore item. Really makes me want to play this shitty buggy game and spend money.
---
Should have been like that from the start. The devs aren't politicians where we need to know who they are. There needs to be a separation between work and private life.
---
Love it.
---
Yes! But I meant more personal attacks like being fat or lazy or comments of that sorts. And that's just not bringing anyone to communicate more. And so a few loud people can ruin the communication for everyone
---
yesterday
---
I'm ok with that.
---
I mean, even popular devs like Ryukishi07 or Zun use pseudonyms.
---
Oh shit that's today? I though I'll have a nap when I get home.
---
"CannedResponse7362 has replied to your comment" 🙄
---
It means they don't want to take responsibility for what they post, like possible hit on their carreers in the future, if new employers investigate their previous jobs. It will bring nothing, regarding Anet2Player communication.
---
Are they now ashamed to write their names when representing a company?
---
It doesn't justify insults, but that's the effect Anet brought on themselves.
---
People like you can't ever take responsibility for your actions. You can do no wrong and it's always the other guy's fault. Reminds me of abusive partners who say "well i wouldn't need to hit her if she'd just do what i want."
---
Professional company would have community manager who buffers the communication between dev team and players.
---
&gt;Icebrood Saga so far feels like an expansion lite
---
Oof, that's not good.
---
&gt;  we'll have to search and identify them
---
Here?
---
&gt;this update also brings with it some features we have previously only received with paid expansions
---
Like what, Mr. "Games Journalist?" I'm not on the hate train for living world, but what could you possibly be referring to? We've been getting new masteries, maps, and story for over 3 years now from living world. How could one sentence be uttered with so much ignorance to the state of the game?
---
&gt;No fuck you
---
i've red so much "criticism" on this sub where people just start assaulting anet after a few lines. No wonder anet won't respond to toxic assholes like you.
---
For fun: 2 mesmers or 2 minion mancer necros or 1 of each. There are only 2 of you, but it feels like 20!
---
Do you have access to maybe old screen shots, they might have your character name in the party panel window, 
---
A friend of mine had to recover his GW1 account recently and couldnt remember the entire char name, but knew that several of them had xxx in them, ( along with the other info he was able to provide ) and that was good enough for support to get him his account back.
---
Im guessing you never linked your GW1 to your GW2 account back in the day.
---
Ugh. You as a consumer are not entitled to know every single person in a company's name.
---
Im surprised this is a new policy, literally every MMO I've played has GMs use a screenname
---
Yeah, we get to be (mostly) anonymous, I don't see why they should not.
---
It also has PR benefits. If post made by a nickname pisses people, they can switch to another one.
---
Wish I could play it.
---
It's not PvP if you're fighting bots or players that are essentially farming rewards or dailies. In fact if you fight bots, is it even PVP at all? ;) 
---
Get anets dick out of your mouth. You'll happily hate on PvP when it comes to resources, development or the community. Yet a new player shows up and asks if gw2 pvp is worth playing and it's suddenly amazing and without issues. Definitely not neglected.
---
OP don't follow my advice. Install the game, play at any time preferably outside of EU prime and you'll see the amazing competitive matches you're put into quickly enough.
---
TIL the blind play Guild Wars 2 and can even post comments!
---
I don't think there's anything specific about gaming communities in contrast to other communities where this is more applicable or apparent. The phrase "don't shoot the messenger" has been idiom for who knows how long for a reason. People don't generally take news they don't want to hear well, regardless of whether it's a gaming community or a community in general. It's all the more reason that Anet should just buckle up and hire actual community managers. They should hire professionals who are trained to perform this exact function instead of having their rank and file devs try and do community management in addition to the actual professional role that the devs were hired for. Trying to get your software engineers or artists to try and do the job of a community manager is not a path to happy fun times for anybody involved.

Wow wow wow, easy there. It is iBS, not a LW s5!
---
The fall dmg trait is in trickery now, and I was running it.
---
I smell SNOW STORM!
---
Except you would know that StrawberryHipHop was the one that gave you the information, and everyone at ANet would know which person in the office uses that handle, and thus who to talk to.  If this makes it more likely that they'll actually talk to us, I'm all for it.
---
I presume you mean that if in Guild Wars 2 you are incompetent you aren't going to have a good time. That's the same for WoW raids and even being decked out in BiS won't carry you through Mythic or similar if you aren't competent and still a good player.
---
When you pay for product or service, you are buying your entitlement to complain. It's on business to learn how to deal with this profesionally.
---
Icebrood Saga includes LW S5 &amp; LW S6.
---
Where are patch notes?!!
---
Where did they say that?
---
Zadorojny himself used "season" term during official announcement.
---
Ok boomer
---
Show me. If it is an actual thing and this community is STALKING THE DEVS and enjoying it boot, show me. Prove the assertion.
---
It better not be shorter than the prologue.
---
Well I don't know about you, but my future employers will never get to see my posts on my current employer's slack or my email exchanges or anything of the like. It's none of their business and I shouldn't be held "responsible" for that shit. 
---
This clearly has less to do with future employment and most everything to do with not wanting players to follow them to their personal online channels like LinkedIn and others expecting them to offer communication about the game in a place where they don't work. They'll still be "responsible" in the sense that whatever they say impacts how players react and Anet will know who they are, which is all that should matter to us.
---
Depending on how strict with name retention they are this might be a method to provide external information without as much fear of internal reprisal.
---
Can you imagine that there are people in GW2 who moan about how much of a grind it is to get to lvl 80? Anyway i remember my first time in this game, my first time in any game because it is always magical. 
---
How ever in my personal opinion after playing on both sides so to speak, what makes GW2 work for me is that it is skill based. If you want to be good at combat you have to be skilled. You have to know exactly how to use one skill in a combo with another in combo with a trait, a rune, a sigil and in combofields, in movemens and in dodges. This is what you work and grind for. To be good. 
---
When there is a expansion in other MMO with a gear tread mill there will be mostly 5 new levels added which makes any gear you grinded for invalid. You haveto re grind it know that in a few months it will again be invalid. And on top of that your new raid gear have a few more stats making you a few more percent better, and the bosses will be updated to match that so that it feels like you are stronger but you really are only having a bit of a better gear.
---
So for me i value skill more. Because skill shows that you are good at the game. You gank people because you are good at the game. You speed run something because you are good at the game. Higher stats is just that, higher stats and you gank people with lower stats. So skill matter more for me and why i stayed longer in GW2 then i have in any other MMO.
---
I think they meant it in a good way. 
---
I guess we will find out soon
---
I believe it was mentioned in the original disappointment stream event.
---
Gotta be a tree for the effective engiblock on Seed Turrets. Yes, actual use of racial skills is occasionally involved!
---
I remember my log ins now. Im just missing a character Name...
---
Would also make it harder for shit head fans to attack them and their families.
---
it sure would be cool if this was an option for stupid people who didn't understand their username would be visible to every other player when creating their account. instead our options are live with it or delete your account (:
---
Sounds like strikes are actually harder which is good. Pardon the hilariously bad Google translate attempt:
---
&gt;One big criticism of the previous episode was the difficulty level of the attack mission - it was far too easy. Within a few missions the Eisbrut construct was done, Raid friends asked stunned: how to prepare for raids? That was the intention, according to the developers. But let's be brief: the new assault missions are definitely going in a better direction. Way is the Vorgeplänkel with jump puzzle, instead we land directly in the Bossraum. There we meet in weekly rotation on one of three bosses: Eisbrut construct (now in stronger), a Kodan duo and the bones. In the game with the developers, we have asked the Kodan duo and have fallen properly on the muzzle. Powerful attacks, patterns to follow and mechanics to learn have left a good impression:
---
The same place the patch is.
---
With the patch
---
&gt;We also had to ask the developers while playing the new assault missions: What about the established content such as raids, fractals, and legendary weapons? The latter have had two complete sets (except underwater weapons) since the introduction of Exordium. But the response turned out sobering: Nothing is off the table, but in the next episodes of the Eisbrut saga, we can not expect it. Even new hairstyles will not exist - a feature that many actually wanted. The reason? In the development of new content, it has never been prioritized, probably not in the future.
---
Oh well
---
We are talking about official forums - a public domain - not slack or emails, which are internal communication.
---
Where did i said that?
---
Im just pointing out where people are coming from with losing their patience at some point and  voices getting more harsh over the years of neglection and ignorance towards their players...
---
Imagine what the reaction will be if it is...
---
This sounds very fun actually.
---
Couldn't find it here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Icebrood_Saga_announcement
---
^ All. Of. This.
---
As a casual I purposely took my time with the skyscale and it took me close to a month to complete. My real push for it came in getting the currencies because those were probably the one of the easier parts. I hated this quest at first but toward the end it was all downhill and now I'm taking a short break before I start the new content that I put on hold to get the mount so I have more to enjoy with it. 
---
Just take your time and don't treat the game like a job - that always takes the fun out of it as a player.
---
What are you even talking about?
---
I mean, saying it feels like a full expansion would be completely dishonest. We have a single map (or 2 if you want to count Ep 0) and the opening of a new mastery system.
---
Do you have a single fact to back that up
---
Professional company would use community manager to handle this stuff, not actual devs, who are not trained with professional communication skills.
---
But this is Anet, a little motorbike who couldn't.
---
&gt; Nothing is off the table
---
RIP
---
When does the update drop?
---
Is this the first confirmation we got that they are not working at all on a third gen legendary weapons?
---
WHEHR EHR MEH PEHSCHT NEEEETS!!!!
---
When is next episode?
---
Is this the first confirmation we got that they are not working at all on a third gen of legendary weapons?
---
Do you have any screen shots of your characters?
---
It sucks that u/JATRiiX is locked out of something he/she wants, and I don't want to blame the victim; however, I am glad someone can't just say "I threw away my house key and now I've decided I want back in.  Here is the address, print me a new key."
---
Pro tip: Get a password manager and key those keys/account information safe.
---
Raids on table limbo?
---
Anet and communicating?
---
With the quasi stalking of devs that has become common on reddit, combined with the growing toxicity of the community, I can't really blame them for wanting a little more anonymity.
---
Why are you directly responding to the journalist on Reddit where he likely isn't reading it?
---
Honestly though, you do make a fair point, but I suppose it's taking into account this isnt tied to the expansions which the former seasons were. If you consider Season 3 and Season 4 part of HoT or PoF respectively, you had to purchase both to obtain access.
---
I may be overthinking it but that may be his logic at least.
---
What does that have to do with anything I said lol?
---
I'm just saying getting the aquabreather can help you escape by jumping in the water because of the swim speed. I also said it could give you a minor combat advantage but that  is unlikely to help.
---
 I didn't say anything about chasing people. Though I guess it could help.
---
So it's not out yet?
---
It's LATE!111!1!! Shame on you ANet!
---
they working for ANET,they are public person which speaking directly for that company. they dont need to know my name,since i only speak for myself and i have 0 rights on their forums. If you are scared and you gona do BOBOO everytime someone insult you on internet,you are probably in wrong line of work. Anyone speaking for company needs to be hold accountable for what hes saying. If anet doing this,they are clearly scared of backlash from all shit they made in past and gona od in future. In the end tho,whos even visition official forum anymore? its literaly nazzi camp,where you cant say anything negative/controversial/interesting/funny/competetive or anything about balance. so who actualy give a fck. only ppl there are last 50 fanboys,which you can easily check when you gona visit that SJWpitofJUSTICE. (yougonabebanned for missgender DRAGON,rly?)
---
Sadly i dont have any screenshots. It's over 13 years ago...
---
i knew it.. "the new mastery from all or nothing is as complicated as meaningless".
---
sorry for the bad translation
---
But you do need to buy PoF to be able to play this new season.
---
If it is short, I suspect that's a consequence of the shorter release cadence, the saga format, and the plans to expand the map. There are going to be growing pains and these first few updates are going to likely be different from what we are used to. But if it means we get updates every couple of months, maps don't go dead, and the story keeps moving forward then I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.
---
Ah, ty for transcript, that's easier to navigate than the video, if I had known it was there I would have looked before my last response.
---
Looks like I was mistaken. I think my brain misinterpreted "it's bigger than a season, it's a saga" to mean more than it does.
---
**"Die neue Episode ist ab sofort in Guild Wars 2 erhältlich" no patch no episode out now**
---
Gotcha.
---
As in todays?
---
Or after that, if the latter, why are you asking on the day of release
---
It doesn't help when an organization uses a single person as their PR delivery system.   
---
It's like when people get up the ass of a President's press secretary when they are just there to talk to the media and have 0 influence on the administration themselves
---
This is just as tied to PoF as Season 4 was.
---
I love it! Especially the scythe.
---
Not even new hair styles? If ANet loves the gemstore so much they sure seem to be missing the mark on a big money maker.  
---
:: Clutches Permanent Hairstylist Contract ::
---
Shouldn't there have been a patch already if it is coming today? Normally it is like 5pm GMT.
---
Shouldnt the patch be like 22m ago?
---
[The release page](https://www.guildwars2.com/en-gb/the-game/releases/november-19-2019/) actually is titled "Whisper in the Dark (s5e1)". (The title displayed in your browser tab.)
---
I think someone forgot to remove that when it went live, War Eternal's page was just titled "War Eternal".
---
I've gotta run soon.  I think GW2's PR is doing a *slightly* better job, and if this helps them then I'm all for it.  I think it's a little too late to hire a community manager, and that even if they did, I get the feeling that they'd be hamstrung NCSoft or management.
---
God forbid anyone being accountable for his actions in 2019.
---
Been playing this game since 2012 and I can't name 3 people at Anet at the moment, so I couldn't care less about this. Good for them I guess?
---
the only legendary anything we will get should be a ring and an amulet I am guessing, just to finish off the set.
---
and? still stupid.
---
Would you deny that ktraining is common outside of prime? SEA? EU? 
---
Would you state those fights - regardless of how entertaining farming lootbags may be - are competitive? Somewhat even and winnable by both sides? How common are these fights -for pugs, not GvG as its not relevant to the discussion here-? 
---
I can go sit inside SM throughout EU prime and i'll have consistent random pugs try to open and capture it. You can wipe them without issues for 5 hours straight. No ktrain, all fights! Unfortunately, you won't get a single /competitive/ fight. 
---
The amount of kills and coverage in NA looks so low I don't think i've ever played a matchup as dead as T3 / T4 NA right now. That said you don't need a high amount of kills to have competitive fights... It does make me wonder if there's any action at all. For reference I'd expect 2-4 times more kills / deaths during good matchups on EU.
---
We already got updates every couple of months before. Remember season 3? We got every 2 or 3 months with new legendaries each patch.
---
Isn’t 10/10:30 the usual
---
Not even the hairstyles Chinese client got :)
---
So knowing who did what is equivalent to wanting to harass people?
---
Are you out of your mind?
---
One might like and not like someone's work, but linking that to threatening and harassment is perverse. Damn.
---
No-one should ever post under their own name.
---
It might be, instead of episode 1 then episode 2 on the same map, it might be easier to think of it as Episode 1 Part 1, then Episode 1 Part 2.
---
If it is indeed shorter, that is.
---
&gt; how to prepare for raids? 
---
More like: How is this supposed to prepare for raids?
---
&gt; Way is the Vorgeplänkel with jump puzzle, instead we land directly in the Bossraum
---
Gone is the unnecessary hastle with jumping puzzles, instead we directly land in the boss area.
---
Lol. Other game devs just hire a community manager with a handle to deal with the community. They've been doing it for years. It's nothing new. Literally nothing's changed. Way to be triggered.
---
Ugh, no new legendaries, elite specs, hairstyles, etc, its just all on their stupid table.  They aren't making anything new I am interested in anymore.  I honestly feel like I won't play this game anymore other than maybe hopping in once every 3 months for a quick 3 hour story if that and go back to forgetting abut the game.
---
I wonder if they cut the story part short in favor of building multiple strike missions?
---
lol no
---
So did we get a new game launcher?
---
Guess what I want tho.
---
What if w8 is literally on the table? We will all be miniatures on a boardgame.
---
I actually don't remember Season 3 as I returned to the game with Flashpoint and was not paying attention to the living story. That said, did we actually get a new episode every 2 months then? I was led to believe we did not.
---
no, however the last communication in that regard happened quite some time ago.
---
Giving your sources when you post something that isn't yours shoudn't be something others have to ask you to do, it should be automatic. It's a basic courtesy that will be useful for an entire lifetime.
---
I don't condone the name calling though.
---
Ye it is pretty much the direction the game will go this entire saga probably. Strike missions for the people who want something "challenging" and the usual 3h storyline. At this point, we probably can't expect any of such things at end of the year at earliest.
---
Does the story really matter though?
---
What “responsibility” should they bear outside of being held responsible via the communication channels we have to the GW2 devs, i.e. the forums on which this is being implemented? I too, having a fairly unique name, would be deeply uncomfortable using that in this context given how nasty (and in some cases downright weird) people on the internet can be.
---
&gt; We surely have issues of people disappearing, but not with appearing opposition, but typically with OVERWHELMING opposition. Like when we face WSR. Huge zergs, not utterly stupid when it comes to fighting, leading to being steamrolled. 
---
I get that you're serious but you're also naive.
---
Gandara is a high population server. When gandara is strong they OVERWHELM their opposition with numbers. Every time. And yet still - they will NOT fight other overwhelming blobs because they can't. Because they're utterly stupid at fighting, and consistently get steamrolled by groups.
---
They all play as /individual/ players, yet they play on one of the busiest most populated servers and consistently roam together. Not because they're good, but because they NEED to overwhelm their opposition.
---
If they cannot, they dissapear from the ditches they came. 
---
No offence, its simply how gankdara plays and has played for years.
---
And it's no suprise. OURS is exceptionally bad at the game. Most of the guild doesn't know what their skills do and mash them randomly, including their raidlead. A simple youtube of their raidlead recording their gameplay shows as much.
---
sigh.
---
Imagine then what is about to come...
---
notch is kinda different because everyone knows his name anyway and if you don't it is 1 google search away, don't know the other 2
---
It was always between 2 and 3 months iirc. Sometimes closer to 2, sometimes closer to 3.
---
JuSt qUiT aNd CoMe bAcK lAtEr
---
Looks great!
---
For some of us, yes.
---
We're all quite patient today. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ;D
---
No its not late, we never get a time when its going to release.
---
So do I understand it correctly that there are no raids nor fractals being developed atm?
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release Check this out, it has dates for all major patches. Season 3 releases were 2-3 month apart. From 2016 July to 2017 November, we got releases on an average of 2-3 months, this included PoF and the first episode of LS4.
---
There's only veterans here that know the answer already!  
---
People are talking ingame like crazy and many spoilers running around.
---
Dungeons are dead.
---
Typically they're at 9am ANet time, which is nearly an hour ago.
---
There is no official patch time so it isn't late lol
---
So much for "expansion level content and features"
---
Here I will spell it out for you. You don't get to verbally abuse someone just because they aren't doing what you want. I'm as dissatisfied with the game as the next guy but flinging insults gets you nowhere. Can that shit.
---
Soon^(tm)
---
The review embargo has hit, I wonder what's happened.
---
[Darude - Snowstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4pXRrTLigg)
---
"Typically" yes, but they have stated before that there is no actual official patch time.
---
He may mean a new log in screen.
---
I think by "next" episode it means this episode. We also don't really know what the release cadence for these will be, now that they changed their shit up.
---
I'm not trying to get my hopes up but I also want to take an interview question translated through google with a grain of salt.
---
:( I hope you are not right about that
---
Are these black lion skins? They're kind of... lackluster imo
---
No, it says that they aren't releasing one with this episode, today. 
---
We have no confirmation of whether or not those are being developed.
---
see the other comment, /u/e-scrape-artist made a great answer.
---
But I can't get everything the game has to offer! I PAID FOR THIS! Scandalous.
---
"In the hunt for Bangar Todbringer..."
---
Lmao I really hope that's not a Google Translate mistake and they actually named him that in the German version.
---
The trailer said upgrade-able weapon set so I think it'll be like the Dragonsblood weapons.
---
You can't hurt something that doesn't exist.
---
No. They're map skins
---
Which maps are dead in 2 weeks? Every map released in LS4 still gets active play, though Grothmar and Dragonfall are especially active all the time.
---
latest I've seen so far is after 11 am PST
---
They are boring, but a lot of people like the "normal" look.
---
In-game rewards and upgradable (like dragonsblood etc) not sure if this is the final version or the first tier
---
Crystal posted her change of employment on her public Twitter feed. How is reading her public Twitter feed stalking? How, in any way, is that on the same level of repeated harrassive and unwanted contact with a person? It's not showing up to her house or buying a burner phone to call her after she blocked your number or any of the creepy stalker shit that is actual stalking. This is reading her public post that she posted on her public Twitter feed.
---
but there's no gameplay... it's just watching a movie with the occasional quicktime event.
---
It's not late until it isn't November 19 anywhere.
---
Twitter? No, not stalking, when you post something on twitter - you're shouting into the void, to be heard by all kinds of creatures that lurk there, good and bad.
---
LinkedIn? Yes, stalking. It's a professional website for prospective employers and employees, and I doubt any of the people who posted the aforementioned threads were looking to hire those devs. You don't casually surf linkedin, you go there specifically to look for employment status updates from specific people. Which is the definition of stalking.
---
At least in least in terms of people that care
---
Yikes, that's damning.
---
Nope, apearently you can make these ingame with new currency.
---
First you have broken versions, then you get *refurbished*... Well, you remake them to former glory.
---
I personaly like them, nice and simple

---
She did. When you put your company banner on your private social media profile and you harm company's reputation, you are profesionally responsible for those actions. It works for every business, not just gaming.
---
pretty funny that they used the old "dulfy preview" spot.
---
Major patches are almost always like 30m-1hr late
---
Honestly I'm surprised they all used their full names this long. People are shitty and I'd be shocked if they had not had to deal with at least a few creepy stalkers or some death threats over the years.
---
I personally do.
---
I enjoy the influences in these weapons, the more I look at them.
---
Not a fan of the paddle Greatsword though
---
It means they're being encouraged to communicate, but don't want people to be able to Google their own names. There's nothing about "responsibility" involved, people hold ANet as a company accountable.
---
Could give some patchy notes to have something while waiting.
---
&gt; Not even new hair styles
---
PoF gave us some new ones but even before that we haven't had any new ones in years.
---
It says episodes plural though.
---
Woooooohoooooo!

is it late? later or coming next on cartoon network.

Last minute major bug fix or what's up with that? :P

well, good to see you like them. I hope you get them all.
---
This doesn't look good if they need to do some last minute testing on release day.
---
"soon"
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/92464/whisper-in-the-dark#latest
---
Filling up my time in between 2hour content releases.
---
According to google translate, it's "episodes". Is that a translation error?
---
Also the phrasing "In the development of new content, it has never been prioritized". With how they have a track record of having problems with hitting deadlines, if they are not prioritizing it, I think they haven't even touched it.
---
I never said that it was the same as this abusive stalking behaviour, I simply pointed out that the community is very aware of the devs social media status and do track what they do there at all times. Whatever you think about JP, that in fact did bring out a very ugly side in some individuals in this community.
---
PvP really isn't as terrible as people are saying it is. It's sort of in the stage where they started to give it attention but people feel like it's been too long and players have hemorrhaged from it, but all Anet can do is continue to do the balance changes and other work they have been communicating about recently. 
---
Most of the complaints you'll see are about alleged bots roaming around PvP, which is true to some extent but a lot of people just go rant about bots because it's an easy thing to place blame on how they aren't moving up the ranks.
---
it's because almost nobody care anymore...
---
You kinda did
---
Jesus christ, this company is a fucking mess... This is supposed to be the big update that would revitalize the game, flush away the negativity, and rekindle the hype in the community. And now they hit us with this...
---
technically that can only be a good thing
---
Oh my gosh, decent looking not particle effect heavy new weapons!?  I love them.
---
I expected some horror theme by this episode, but last minute testing is too damn much!

Nah they just release fuck testing am I right.

Miyamoto has long been recognized as someone who does not prioritize narrative in gaming. He famously requested the story Of Mario Galaxy 2 be largely stripped away. He has also been called a relic of his time and possibly not as in touch with modern gaming audiences for whom story is more important. I play Nintendo games, talk with Nintendo fans, and read reviews of Nintendo games. People do care about the story quite a lot, sometimes to the point of not caring as much as about complex gameplay.

Community managers exist solely to placate reactionary idiots that are incapable of rational though, yet *are* capable of smearing shit all over the walls when they're not exclusively pandered to.

Unliekely. They are usually behind too much grind for me, haha
---
I'm saying if they weren't prepared to release due to a lack of testing, then they shouldn't have announced to release it today.
---
but the karma...
---
I don't know German, but plurality is often erroneous in translations. Even if it's correctly translated there isn't really any telling that it was a miscommunication (I don't know which devs they sat down with and whether they communicated in German, for example). 
---
Point is, it could be totally correct that we won't get shit for several episodes, which sucks, but I wont take this translated post as an indication of that.
---
excuse for forcing us to read those articles nobody cares.
---
I'm flabbergasted that that hasn't been a choice so far. What the actual fuck.
---
If they need police escorts for conventions, this is totaly ok. Fuck those that made this necessary
---
GW2 is pegi 12 game. With target audience like this, Anet should have community manager since the beginning.
---
What? It is already 19 november and 19/7pm hour in most of Europe.
---
I wonder how much longer before they realize that the world is much larger than just /r/guildwars2

All stalking behaviour is abusive behaviour. That's what makes it stalking. Reading or sharing public information is not in itself stalking. It would have to be a course of action that would reasonably cause distress or a fear of safety in the other person to constitute stalking. For instance, if you went around releasing information, like prior conviction records, about someone in an attempt to get them harmed or make them afraid, that could be classified as stalking. If you share information from someone's LinkedIn page because you want to discuss whether your online video game is likely to get more raids in the future, not stalking.
---
they are doing this because of sad ppl that start harassing them and their families because they were making posts with their real names....
---
Then you are not doing your stalking job well enough. Just yesterday I recommended the game in this sub to new player with doubts if its worth investing time in. If any, totally new players are getting best deal of all of us.
---
Yeah, the
---
&gt; Lead Game Designer
---
and their design team are definitely the ones slacking off right now by not testing client code or kicking servers.
---
Oh all right that is what you mean, yea I remember at least once they pushed update day lat for Europe, but was still released on tuesday for USA.
---
Fake. Us chronos have been waiting for that first.
---
I'm not going to buy something just to "show my support." They have decided to go with a model of free lesser content (imo) than a paid expansion. So I'm going to keep playing their updates without spending a dime like I have since buying PoF. And I'll probably keep doing so until they let me spend money on an expansion, something I consider to be good value for my money.
---
Rough translation of the conclusion: "Episode 3 should hopefully come soon, because there's not much to do in Bjora's Marches."
---
That doesn't sound promising.
---
If the game is actually running, just close the process.
---
I'm not buying gems since HoT. My last real money purchase was PoF. It helped me nothing in getting things I want from anet.
---
Maps don't go dead? Like to see that happen, how many of the LS maps are still alive? Silverwaste, dragonfall and maybe Istan? I'll give the new map 2 weeks before it is deserted again. Let's hope I'm wrong
---
A planing, tracking and managing software
---
But it feels so good to throw around these phrases!
---
at least its not SNOW STORM!
---
Hard times confronting other opinion but yours?
---
So we're gonna get lots and lots of bugs if you are testing right before the release. I got ya.
---
They didn't announce it today, they announced it weeks ago and worked up to that deadline.
---
But I guess as a person with so many hit game titles you have released you know better how this stuff works.
---
You have a virus. Delete system 32 to resolve for the issue.
---
not really
---
i did but it just close the game. im talking like the window seem to not let me access it while the game it self running
---
Because they are real people officially representing their company. Don't like public exposure? Don't post or hire community manager.
---
i did. bought some gems few days ago :)
---
Cool
---
At this point another friendly reminder: Exchanging gold to gems is also payment, even if you personally don't spend money. 
---
The gem-&gt;gold/gold-&gt;gem exchange works self-sufficient, it's an own cirlce. If you buy gems for gold, you literally get the gems somebody else payed moey for (and exchanged to gold). 
---
So you don't have to spend (your own) money to "vote with your wallet". Exchanging gold is the same.
---
Grothmar is still active, I always see people in Bitterfrost, and Sandswept has been really active in the last few months. Those are the ones I routinely go to personally. I know Ember Bay, Draconis Mons, and Sirens Landing are pretty dead though.
---
[here's an old pic](http://imgur.com/a/XcALuTf). I've moved stuff around in my office a lot since though.
---
Go to task manager, close game, and start again.
---
Remember when The Ascension was the yearly reward for the ranked structured mode but then it became the spvp reward. I do.
---
I'm not? Someone made an accusation that I believe is baseless. I asked them to provide proof. Stalking is absolutely awful and horrifying. Nobody should experience it. This is all the more reasons that accusations of stalking should be grounded in a legitimate understanding of what stalking is so that accusations of stalking are treated with the seriousness that they deserve.
---
Makes sense but at the same time it's not like people won't know or be able to google who the big names are. It's not like people don't know the alias' of the devs at Blizzard just because they use different handles.
---
I've been buying nothing since PoF release, but rest assured that my non-purchase will never compare in magnitude to that one guy buying 50 Black Lion Keys for that mount skin.
---
You never own a party in GW2. Crucial oversight for group content.
---
Restart your computer or log off of the profile on your PC.
---
You know what's the problem? You're too elitist   
---
How could you not accept a person who just wanted to play a game they paid for?   
---
You should adjust your requirements to the people who join, not the other way around.   
---
You elitist fuck.
---
Who cares, they don't reply to no shit unless it's about some cash shop crap anyways...
---
No! Give it now! Then I can come on here and farm karma by complaining about how broken it is!
---
It's not an oversight. It's like this by design.
---
Huh? they don't ONLY test on release day lol
---
Fake. Us Necros have been waiting for that first.
---
oh.. so this is the testing they were talking about.. taste testing ^^/s
---
Oversight in design, intended or not.
---
I'm afraid we can't help you much here, there's tons of possible reasons for a program to bug like that. Contact [support](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us) and they might be able to guide you through fixing your problem.
---
Worked for me
---
Devs: WE LOST OUR BONESKINNER! "gasp" - quick, fuse those quaggans into aboquagmation! 
---
Quaggans - NooOOooOOOOoo!
---
Totally. They're clearly just now designing the episode. It's so totally obvious.
---
Seems like a good idea, it'd be 'easier' for people used to such names [mmo players] to try connect with them , and it'd stop people harassing them or their relatives. Might even increase usage of the forms overall. 
---
Nothing spectacular  , but it certainly isn't anything bad and is better then nothing~
---
What? This happens all the time, across multiple companies. Just take Digital Extremes - they were fixing last minute UI bugs on the release day of Update 26. Just because there aren't completely new features doesn't mean there aren't bugs, and you can't complete all of your testing ahead of time. Sometimes things just behave differently when pushed to live.
---
They paid for the service, not for spot in OP's party.
---
Never said they do. What's your point?
---
I did not realise there was some sort of police here counting people who say no and make sure they keep their word...
---
Nor did i know i had to somehow defend a choice to use money on this game.
---
I am sorry but this is starting to reach the highest level of how silly people are at this point. If you dont like the game then holy shit just leave it. Be done with it and move on. Don't be the girlfriend/boyfriend that stalk you for years because they can not get over that the relation ship did not become what they wanted it to be and there for they can't let go.
---
Nice to see again Mr Warrior
---
Well, I'm not stalking you because you are nowhere near exciting enough. I just always see you with something negative to say. Even with your recommendations it still includes some negative talk about how current players have nothing to do.
---
You actually do.
---
Story instances and the personal instance are owned by the opener.  When they leave, the instance closes.
---
But that only happens in those specific cases.
---
damn, are you the guy that joined that party?
---
I wonder how much longer all you guys are gonna be here making silly comment about a game you obviously dont enjoy anymore.
---
Written by Ed **Orr**
---
I'm pretty sure you didn't notice how my message is literally drowning in sarcasm.
---
Testing on release day is normal. Unexpected issue can drop up until (and after) a release goes live.
---
There is nothing wrong with them fixing this problem now rather than after the patch is actually out. We always receive minor hotfixes shortly after a major patch comes out, and fixing a problem now just means one less of those.
---
Any software, game or otherwise, that is a live service or live development environment is *always* testing, even if we don't formally label it as such. The consumer always finds ways to break things that you don't expect. It sucks, sure, but it isn't a problem unique to ArenaNet at all.
---
You are instance owner, not party owner - not the same, but another flow in basic game design.
---
Bought some gems for the new mount skin. Leggo!
---
Bet login servers will go down XD

Gee, it's almost as if they had CMs until they realised that it's not really worth it or particularly effective to try and herd sheep.
---
It's not elitist to want people to at least have some KP so that the content won't be miserable for everyone else just because you want to get carried. If you don't have KP there are lots of training guilds.
---
The thing is that normal groups are *not* anyones party. There is no leader, it's not really "your" party, even though you opened it.
---
That means the group has to block not only people from your blocklist, but from all players in your group. 
---
I mean I don't see a problem there at this point.
---
Fuck off maggot. Everyone has their own requirement for groups. If you dont accept those you can fuck off and create your own group
---
Nope, was stuck at work. I nromally come home to a patch at 5pm UK time.
---
I bet game chat was cray and got even crazier lol
---
That's your personal impression with all the flaws behavioral research provides.
---
&gt;everyone should just as much as possible cut work and private life. 
---
I don't know. Personally I think that strict separation between work and other life is too inflexible. Everyone should have an option to keep them separate, though,
---
If their idea of expansion content is being able to level a niche crafting profession via a fetchquest you know there's a problem.
---
They are features. It's 400 Gems per bug fix now!
---
Can you provide me your ingame name so i can go ahead and preemptively block you? Thanks!
---
I can't believe there are actually folks complaining about them *fixing* something in these comments.
---
I mean, sure, it's not great that they might have bugs in the first place, but wouldn't you rather those be fixed now rather than having a buggy launch?
---
I'm waiting for patch to drop to log back in. LOL.
---
You bet your ass I’m buying the boneskinner springer skin!
---
I said they announced to release it today. Not that they announced today that it will be released today. Use some brain cells please. 
---
What they do with their time developing the game is purely up to speculation. Judging by my experience in the field, they should have already moved onto other projects further down their plans when they announced the release, but that would be speculation and has no weight. Are you a developer for Anet? No? Didn't think so. This is not normal whatsoever.
---
Stopped being community manager in 2012, which is when GW2 got released - still nope.
---
This is already a "buggy" launch :S
---
It feels like a "sign of the times".
---
Good advice. You're very knowledgeable. I bet the game titles you have released are incredible. Which ones are they, I want to buy all of them right now.
---
In this sub you can never be sure.
---
That's instance ownership and you can't join those instances after they are created.
---
One of us does not know the exact definition of oversight.
---
Kinda is.
---
There's no way that this comes as a surprise to anyone.
---
I don't know for sure that we could say 2021. I also saw that quote and was upset about it. 
---
Assuming there is a continued 3-month release timing per episode, assuming the article is accurate and we are not getting a fractal/raid today or on the 3rd episode, the earliest we would be looking at is the 4th episode which would be roughly 5/2020-6/2020. That will also only be for either raid or fractal as I do not believe Anet has ever released both. So it could be potentially until 9/2020 before both fractals and raids see updates. 
---
This all assumes they will still release a raid or a fractal in the 4th and/or 5th episode. They could always unbind it from the ~~living world~~ saga and do it at some other time of course. But what makes me most worried is when they said this
---
&gt;Nothing is off the table, but in the next episodes of the Eisbrut saga, we can not expect it. 
---
I guess I am out of the loop, but what is the Eisbrut Saga? Is it the Icebrood saga? Second, I always get nervous when they mention things aren't "off the table"...
---
ask one person to leave for a while,wait till you get 5th and kick warrior and reinvite that person which left. ez
---
Who harassed them and when?
---
there isnt really much new info...
---
Sadly none of it will ever happen. Both Anet and their challenging content crowd (CCC) would rather see it burn down than share it with people who don't deserve it.
---
if it was, it would be called community manager
---
I don't give a damn, I'm not in a court.
---
Pokemon shield it is 🍿
---
Nah.
---
Best thing about GW2 vs WoW is you'll never feel pressured into constantly grinding. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of things to grind for, but GW2 operates solely on horizontal progression (new gear is in the form of new statlines or cosmetics or ways to play the game), rather than WoW which is exclusively vertical progression (new gear is objectively better and stronger than old gear, and invalidates the hard work you put in just a patch ago). Gear you grind for now will be just as strong two months or two years from now as it is now, so there is never a timer ticking down to where it's not "worth it" to progress in the current patch. You can go at your leisure, and if you end up taking a month break from the game, you can rest assured that when you get back you won't have to play catch-up to where everyone else is
---
Let the people have their freedom.
---
looks like none cares anymore anyways looking at all the down votes...
---
&gt; After that the next one will be roughly at this time next year.
---
September. We had a prologue in September. So in worst case scenario we'll have this kind of content for second half or 2020.
---
**That said** they did say they didn't feel restricted to release only on episode releases for LS5, or something like that. Who knows.
---
Allowing employees to use a pseudoname on the official forums has nothing to do with private life: it's still work.  What this policy change should remind people is how out of touch ANet's PR policy has been if they required their employees to use real name on their forums.
---
I'm also a fan of more simple, elegant designs. These however look like something dropped by low level trash mobs in open world. Maybe the updated versions are better.
---
The biggest problem I see with GW2's fight design but especially in raids(but I haven't done all the bosses yet) is that they seem too predictable. They are not chaotic fights where anything can happen at any moment but carefully choreographed dance routines. Before people have learned the fights and have enough practice it might look like the chaotic fight but as people get better it becomes more mechanical. 1 minute into the fight I do this, 1m30s I do that, 1m45s it is ... and the better a group gets the more it becomes a near exact repetition. I think most people do not want their end goal to be a poor imitation of a bot. Some people might be very proud of their mechanical precision but it's pretty hard to beat an actual machine when it comes to that.
---
Caving into the cries for tank and healer probably didn't help either since it reduced some mechanics to things only the healer or tank needs to pay attention. As you've said there is only so many mechanics they can throw in but if only one person needs to pay attention to it then you have effectively reduced the number of mechanics by 1 for the other 9 people. Having distinct roles doesn't seem that bad but to make an extreme example, if you have 10 mechanics that can be covered by 1 person then you can end up with a fight were the people experiencing the fight just deals with 1 mechanic for the whole fight.
---
So called tests 5 minutes before release will help nothing with severe problems.
---
It exist but only open world and story is there
---
Sound out Eisbrut. It's just a bad google translate of Icebrood
---
This is why I took off work tomorrow instead of today.
---
yah
---
[The table is true. It's full of waffles](https://twitter.com/Gaohmee/status/1196836029082157057)
---
mhm not enough flash :s
---
That's how it is. Deal is it or not.
---
Just be careful with this. This is English speaking devs communicating to a German based site who are then translating their content for English speaking audiences. 
---
Mistranslation and miscommunication isn't worth getting riled up over. If they really were putting the pin in these content types it would be headline news across all the other publishers.
---
Most likely they mean these things arent in this specific patch.
---
Thank you for keeping us informed.
---
OMG you are right, that is hilarious! I was going crazy trying to figure out where they mentioned Eisbrut.
---
The table is on the table, don't worry. :)
---
You don't need to be in court, but why would you choose a non-credible source over the Department of Justice?
---
This was likely just a Google autotranslate, so yeah, Eis -&gt; Ice, brut -&gt;brood probably was the attempt.
---
Yeah anet didn't care about their more veteran and committed playerbase for quite a while now and putting all of their resources only for the ultra casuals who log in every 3-4 months for the 6 hours of new contend...
---
but we dont know what exactly theyre testing so no point jumping to extremes.
---
what a joke for a company
---
Actually they likely were already running tests before the 5 minute mark and ran into a snag that required them to run them late. No reasonable person said "let's run a test just as we are about to go live"
---
This is not a hard concept to grasp people. It's like practicing your speech the morning of your presentation. It's entirely possible to have new info be added in or notice an error that needs correcting.
---
The game is going full speed for maintenance mode. If you cant see it, if you cant feel it, then prepare for a hard crash.
---
or... they got delayer but it's PR-friendly to call it tests.
---
&gt; Deal is it or not.
---
Almost
---
&gt; they shouldn't have announced to release it today.
---
If you don't want your message to get mixed up you should learn to communicate better instead of expecting people to infer what you meant to say. That's on you.
---
&gt; Judging by my experience in the field, 
---
What games have you worked on?
---
Completely dropping your veteran and committed player base and only offering contend for ultra casuals who log in every 3-4 months for the 6 hours of new "content" can backfire quite a bit, also because those players are usually the most vocal in social media and producing content.
---
They are just doing things like widening margins and making the spaces between letters larger so they can make it seem like they have more than a paragraph of actual game content in the patch, especially since the black lion chest update notes are roughly 4 pages long.
---
i hate witchhunting, but was it atlan by any chance?

I've gotten 2,000 hours out of Gw2. I think I got my 60$ worth. And this isn't like a "this game makes you grind to stat-pad player playtime averages" thing either. That's usually a point I myself bring up when people poo-poo video-game critics about game value. But in this case, Gw2 was just raw entertainment for me, and if it suddenly disappeared I'd still have gotten my money's worth.
---
I spent 2,000 hours doing mostly activities I found very entertaining with chill people. Stop pretending like you aren't going to play this game or abstain from spending money you wouldn't have spent anyways.
---
It's not that the devs don't want to implement this, it's just that they can't. Because they are a bunch of incopetent clowns
---
&gt; Almost
---
Almost**.**
---
You forget that for us EU peeps it's already 8PM.
---
Well said
---
its clearly a joke bro
---
You're welcome to get the fuck out of here.
---
&gt; that its not universally usable like mount abilities
---
My biggest gripe with masteries. "Horizontal progression" that lasts you one map sucks so bad.
---
ArenaNet just keeps developing new systems and then abandon them immediately. They've done so since the release of GW2, and the game suffers for it.
---
5/2020-6/2020 for the 4th episode?
---
what?
---
You expect them to suddenly drop new episodes every 1-2 months? when we only got a new one every 3-4 month for years now?
---
IIRC you need a LinkedIn account to view other profiles but that hardly counts as security since anybody who uses it will have such access.  So anything you put on LinkedIn is also shouted into the void for all to see/hear.  
---
The only time you ever have any claim to privacy is if someone needs your express permission to access info of yours.  And whatever you put on LinkedIn absolutely does not meet that threshold.  
---
Remember when we thought our grandparents were nuts when they worried about the government listening in on their phone calls and such?  If someone looking you up on Google or LinkedIn causes you distress you may need to get off the internet, because there's almost certainly a whole lot more literally anyone could find or discern about you just looking at your reddit post history, let alone what your LinkedIn or whatever other such might say.  
---
And for what it's worth, when someone starts taking that kind of time to spy on or learn about you is when it starts becoming stalking, because it's clearly gone beyond a passing interest in a public figure; Which we all are here.
---
You know what? I'd be ok with that. I play since day one and I have so many things to do I could play without additional stuff for years yet
---
Do you have any sources that support your statements?
---
I have access to the article through my university.
---
Quote taken from the article "identify stalking as an (a) intentional (b) pattern of repeated behaviors toward a person or persons (b) that are unwanted, and (c) result in fear, or that a reasonable person(or jury) would view as fearful or threatening."
---
I usually tell people to take screens as trophies because you can only get these mails when you are the victor.
---
A guildie says they just respond with nonsense like "sorry I don't know how to swim"  regardless of what they say.  This usually inflicts 25 stacks of confusion irl and reduces any negative effect on your mood.
---
Good for you
---
Considering how often the server crash issue happens compared to this happening then it might be something bigger than that.
---
Springer trying to be relevant post-Skyscale.....pshhhhh
---
I'm glad you do.
---
I'm sad I don't.
---
A community managers facilitates the communication between developers and players. They don't necessarily replace it and have everything go through them.
---
The real lesson to be learned here, which I'm 99.9% sure is what happened here (based on your side of the story), is that kp pings mean absolutely nothing and you judging someone based on kp pings makes you stupid and a "twat".
---
I think this would be a fair assessment of the situation, especially if he/she attempted to start the fractal level and you (or someone else in party) kept declining the start only to pester him/her to ping "kp"...like it means something (it doesn't).
---
If it did, you wouldn't have groups like [this](https://i.imgur.com/Zc5kDX3.jpg) who kicks players like the DE for not pinging, only to invite him/her back (due to the group taking too long to fill) to get hard carried by the person that refused to ping...while you earn your amazing "kp" to use as pings in the future to show how experienced you are.
---
Sorry my bad lemme get rid of this
---
Ty my bad
---
That lines up with the DoJ definition but not the one in the Wikipedia article. Thank you for taking the time and effort to jump in and take a look either way.
---
We used to have party owners a long while back and it got changed so there is now no owner. With party owners, they owned the instance of the dungeon so they could go afk in the middle of say arah p4 and either everyone left and started over or you waited for hours til they got back from Arbys. You couldn't kick the instance owner and it led to trolling like that which is why they changed it.
---
because they want to bait you into thinking that the droprates for those weapons aren't actually all that bad and that you have a chance of completing the set. i'm pretty sure they weren't supposed to disclose that behaviour in the first place.
---
Oh, no. I don't mean changing the name of the account, but just making a different account, with a different name.
---
It's not like they need to post in the forums with the game accounts.
---
I can’t lose my karma! My magic internet points are all I have! Sorry about that, sarcasm is hard to read cuz there’s no tone of voice
---
You had no time to test in the last 3 months i guess, too many other contents to drop
---
Players get to spew all kinds of vitriol on the forums from behind anonymous usernames.  Why shouldn't the devs be able to respond with the same level of anonymity?  We all know it's still someone representing Anet because of the red color, and it lowers the safety risk for the reps.  Why would you be against this kind of change?
---
We want more communication from Anet.  If this harmless change makes devs feel safe, they'll be more likely to communicate with the players more often.  If you were in a dev's shoes, would you post on the forums if you felt that what you posted could pose a safety risk to you or your family if it was poorly received?  There are some seriously crazy people out there, who do very scary and crazy things!
---
Your answer is to either not post, or hire a community manager.  If they don't post, the community complains about a lack of communication.  So that's not an answer.  They could hire a community manager.  That community manager would be riddled with proverbial bullets quite quickly (ie the messenger was shot), especially if there was a delay in communication.  You'd also want them to use their real name in their communications, so there's that safety issue again.
---
This anonymous handle approach seems like a much simpler, better solution!
---
Instance owner =/= party owner
---
Shut up, stop crying and buy the new mount skin already dam freeloader1!1!
---
More like expansiOMEGALULn amirite
---
Is it though? 
---
Remember, this is the internet, people might seriously believe it.
---
well if you like playing an mmo with almost no players sure
---
^ Always take the day after a release
---
I admit that I've always wondered why they used their own names when making posts on the forums to begin with and that post makes it sounds like that was likely a company policy.  
---
Neat?  If it turns into more communication, it's a good thing.  But I also have to laugh at it a bit because they've had that option here on reddit for years now lol
---
Jesus, the shilling is so strong.
---
Party ownership was a function when the game launched. It was very easy to abuse, since the party leader could instantly kick all four other members. It was very common to hear stories about PUGs getting to the last boss of a dungeon path only to get kicked by a single party leader, who would then invite their guildmates.
---
It also would kick the entire party from the dungeon/fractal if the party leader DC'd.
---
It's not an oversight -- we had party ownership and it was far, far worse than what we have today.
---
Never forget the 8-10 mastery bloat from the Siren's Landing release.
---
The game is on maintenance course pretty much since pof release. Just accept it.
---
They want to milk as much as possible before ppl start leaving. You cant sustain a game by focusing on do-it-1-time-content that takes 2-5h every few months withstory that feels like a mediocre low budget series (wasting cool lore / world of Tyria with bland characters and plots)
---
Aren't there two tiers though?
---
Maybe the upgrades will be shinier.
---
That GS looks like a slightly reskinned version of the one you get from VG.

"Don't you all have content?"
---
Don't you have a mobile phone?
---
They're just bells with a loooooong curly handle.
---
I know right? These people are acting like we all need to pitch in and buy 22 dollar mount skins from the gemstore. Like, no. I'd rather pay 30 for an expansion.
---
And they are demonstrating that they are beginning to put that into action for season 5. Stop whining.
---
I think the final line of fear/threatening isn't explicitly stated in the wikipedia quote but paraphrased because unwanted and/or repeated surveillance IS threatening in itself
---
For the GW2 , i think if someone publicly posted my linkedin information on reddit, i would feel uncomfortable, considering: it is not an open social media (it's for business purposes only), knowing my updated work info REQUIRES checking my profile (how many times were fans refreshing the dev's to look for info like this?) 
---
This implies intentional, repeated surveillance of the dev. It can be threatening and uncomfortable knowing how fast information about the dev circulated after they updated their linkedin. Linkedin is a public social media, but it wasn't used as intended for this case. So, i think a form of stalking did happen.
---
To start the personal story, go to the green star on your map. You unlock it by parts which become available every 10 levels so if you're not level 10, you will not see it yet.
---
If you want to experience the full story, you should play the personal story first and only if you can, the dungeon story modes. After that you should watch or read a summary of the living world season 1 which is not available for replay. The rest of the story is replayable, living world seasons or sagas you can purchase them from the gemstore and expansions from the gw2 website. The order of everything is detailed in your story journal tab in your hero pannel but it goes like this: Personal story &gt; Living world season 1 &gt; Season 2 &gt; Heart of thorns expansion &gt; Season 3 &gt; Path of fire expansion &gt; Season 4 &gt; Icebrood saga (current story)
---
Good timing! 
---
Now they can hide from this release day shitshow easier!
---
Some people are better known by their pseudonyms than their legal names ...
---
Yes, it's the first time they've announced a more frequent release schedule. The previous 10 don't count. /s
---
Why Cantha tho?
---
Are you retarded?
---
Well it's her cheat day lol
---
Part of me thinks this might have been great. 
---
Dragons have always been a tired trope in my opinion. GW2 had a different idea around dragons being forces of nature, but that made the storytelling far less compelling. The personal story was straight up bad as was the Zaitan fight. Mordremoth had a little more interest, but still not much.
---
Only now, 7 years later are elder dragons starting to get more interesting as they seem to move away from just straight up forces of nature.
---
must get rid of toxic in community
---
^(destroy me king)
---
Since when has Anet been considerate towards EU players?
---
Yup, he is
---
Then GTFO of the subreddit then.  You're being a downer.  
---
We have a bowl of cheerios coming up, and you're gearing up to pee in it.  That's lame.
---
You filling in for LordKrall or something today?
---
And to OP for creating useless trash threads to keep people entertained.
---
I wouldn't put it past them.
---
You post shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how voting works. your vote is your vote, and it has the value of 1 vote, regardless of how anyone else votes.
---
Whoa calm down with the conspiracy theories
---
Because miles and miles of copy pasted slums are the height of beauty.
---
Guessing here but allot of people loved cantha for the asian feel and the lore it had.
---
Ok but please spread that part about no new legendaries around, I need the price of mystic coins to tank so I can finish Exordium
---
Probably an unpopular opinion,  but I hated the Cantha expansion.
---
Actually enjoyed playing through the Elonia one more.
---
they look awfull
---
This is not about QA but more like OS update on servers recently that broke stuff but worked well last week. This is what IT departments everywhere have fears of during every release. Still above average situation if catched before going online...
---
I wasn't expecting raids again ever so this is good news
---
You’re getting a bowl of cheerios when people have been begging for a full course meal.
---
"LinkedIn and Twitter"  
---
LMAO  
---
Try to not dislocate your shoulder reaching that hard
---
Epstein didn't kill himself.
---
What are these gems you speak of? What a preposterous idea! Buying things for gems. I think you'll find the mounts are in the FAR end of the black lion chest RNG =P
---
Low effort post. Delete.
---
The only thing that prevents us from rushing through the story chapter in 30 minutes is the heart/event roadblocks...
---
Agree on elite specs. 
---
I just want an expansion tbh, any theme. Cantha sounds interesting enough.  New specs, new zones, new features that feel like an improvement over what we've had before without being just another way to milk players.
---
On what maps does this debuff happen?
---
More so to indicate this saga crap is just a pr spin
---
No they're not on the same level as consumers.  Up until this change, they didn't have the luxury of anonymity, and were open to reprisal from unhappy/crazy players because of it.  They aren't free to just not respond at all, unlike consumers.  
---
The red handles indicate their status as reps of Anet.  Why do you need more info than that?  What does knowing their real name give you that an anonymous handle doesn't?
---
Wow, just no
---
Forum moderators fucking suck.
---
Everywhere. 
---
They deserve no pity. They deserve no respect. Mods make this place a worse place to be in, not a better one. This isn't some burden of responsibility that they have been cursed with. They have demanded positions of power to fill some void in their own lives, and almost without exception take that measly amount of power and extrapolate it to the nth degree, abusing it to inflate their own importance.
---
In my case just elite specs
---
Sounds like somebody already pissed in yours. Calm down, post police
---
My eyes
---
I mean, I kind of get it, but that's a pretty lame list to follow and if you're bothered to lurk this sub, I'm going to assume you think there are other things that may pique your interest.
---
Simple things like QoL changes I didn't expect have piqued my interest to play more actively in this game before. Despite all the shit going on with build templates (much of which I agree is legitimate and problematic), they have brought me back because they got me on the path to actually building out my alts I barely geared.
---
I actually like to go into Shiverpeaks. mountainous maps are gorgeous.
---
Those people have given up
---
Party leader and instance owner were different things. Prior to an update in November 2012, the player that created the party was the party leader and could kick any other member without a vote.
---
In fact, I think they might upgrade even further (tier 3?) with episode 2 if it takes place on the same map.
---
New Elite Specs? I guess there are too few WvW and PvP players left to complain about unbalanced elite specs anymore, so what harm is there to throw them into the game without balancing the ones from PoF.
---
Cantha? Well, fine. Although I'd rather like to see parts of Tyria we haven't been to thus far. The core continent of Tyria to the east is completely unexplored and we have no clue what is there.
---
Cantha means nothing to me. I would like more explorable content even better is solable
---
GW1's slums were poorly made because of the engine's limitations.
---
Imagine the level of Blade Runner-esque slums they could do in GW2.
---
I don't mind that it's short IF that means we'll be getting something like Season 2 in terms of content delivery speed and progressive expansion.
---
I loved Season 2, played the shit out of it, got lumi and everything. Why? Because the content release cadence was fast-paced and there was always something new to do every 2-3 weeks, even if the new stuff was incremental.
---
Did the lore behind that ever get explained? Like, it's a common object with an easy shape to focus arcane energy through, or something?
---
&gt; Allowing commander tag for 5 man groups
---
now, this would be an option I would pay for and not regret it.
---
The freaking Story Mode of dungeons should be made to be solo-able by casuals or somehow integrated into the personal story rather than still being 5-man required.
---
If you don't do the Story Mode you miss out on a great deal of the storyline.
---
&gt; party leader left the instance crashed
---
It didn't crash, it closed instance. Those are very different things.
---
Do not get . Can u explain ?
---
The paraphrase is too broad for what it's citing, in my opinion. The purpose of a definition is to nail down the specific elements of a concept to describe what it is. A paraphrase of a definition that leaves out key elements of the definition is not an appropriate paraphrase. A definition should not imply because that runs counter to the entire purpose of a definition.
---
I see where you're coming from but it's not a premise that I would personally agree with. I don't see it as threatening behaviour. There's a difference between being uncomfortable and being threatened or fearful. For instance, I get social anxiety like the Dickens. Like the fuck up your life kind of social anxiety. For me a post like that would definitely make me uncomfortable, but it wouldn't make me feel afraid or threatened.
---
In any event, I appreciate the civil conversation even if we don't ultimately see eye to eye here.
---
Personal Story = Main story (of the base game). If you care for story and want to experience it in order, just follow the personal story and explore maps along the way. There aren't any typical quests like in other MMOs, you just run around, explore and do events ("world quests"). You'll be 80 before finishing the personal story, and afterwards you can take a look at addon stuff (or the past living story episodes - living story seasons work as bridges between addons storywise).
---
If I was referring to a specific narrow definition of value, I would have used one. Bye.
---
Just to add to this comment, there is also parallel story in dungeons, those are best played simultaneously when one plays story of same level.
---
You don't need to complete the story chapters in any order after you hit level 80. Start with the PoF story to unlock your basic raptor mount.
---
Translation: fuck you
---
three posts below this one...
---
I agree. But from the statement, it sounds like they don't have any fracs or raids currently in the pipeline. That means that, given development times, we could reasonably see them in mid to late 2020. That's not good.
---
Thats the expansion level stuff we were promised /s
---
Why even bother logging in anymore?
---
Hi, author of the article right here! Thanks for noticing :) It's a mix of a couple things:
---
* I miss Dulfy too
---
* It's always day in Honor of the Waves
---
* pretty great lighting, no visual background "noise"
---
* nobody can annoy me while trying to get a good shot
---
I am implying that they shouldn't do the tests 5 minutes before release. They should have had everyting all wrapped up and ready to go at least a couple of days before and only doing tiny little things in the mean time. If they have to delay a patch for a couple of hours that means they didn't have the major parts done and ready to go to begin with.
---
Typical non gemstore  weapons.
---
New race
---
the first personal story starts at lvl 10. You will get a mail and a green star point to where to go.
---
A shill is someone that works for a company but pretends to be a customer that endorses that company.
---
Ty and happy cake day
---
imagine having the balls to tell this after the shit they produced for making build templates possible, haha.
---
maybe ill buy gems when they add someone worthwhile gameplay wise.
---
ok will delete. Sorry for trying to contribute
---
Well not necessarily, because they would use their real name on the forums, but then users would find the devs on twitter, and complain to them there about stuff.
---
He's just expressing disappointment with a game he loves. I think a lot of us can relate. Gw2 has a lot of potential that it doesnt live up to. He literally just said he's posting to vent, not trash the new episode.
---
"please let them test this stuff 3h after the episode should have dropped, not a week in advance guys stop being so mean to the company"
---
On the table.
---
Oh, those pictures in my head... make it stooOOOoop!
---
Oh yeah? You want me to tell you how long we are waiting for WvW Alliances and updates to PvP? :D
---
So true. Seeing Q3 revenue I can't blame Anet.
---
let's watch that happen, that's not the first time i hear that from them
---
I am not
---
I just play less than I did 20 years ago. So this is the perfect mmo for a father with a hard work who just want to relax . No vertical rpogression and not too much stuff to do so u do not have to rush.
---
But hey downvote me to hell just because this game has a core target which is not yours.
---
20 years ago I would have agreed with you but now I want a different game and gw2 is perfect for what I need
---
Have you done the Minestery of Purity quest line in hard mode?
---
I play it like a single player game with a huge map to explore. If they'd add bots to fill a party or a raid it would be perfect .
---
some other players and I saw this coming when strike missions were announced. Content development is catered towards casuals (they fund the game).
---
Fractals are not that popular anymore. Siren's Reef, Twilight Oasis and Aquatic rework were not well received.
---
Raids became less played after Wing 6.
---
WvW alliances, I lost hope as to these being ever released.
---
Legendaries, I just wish they add to wvw/pvp their equivalent for pve trinkets.
---
That's not an unpopular opinion. Factions was by far the least likely gw1 campaign.
---
They're fixing it a week (being generous) and 3 hours too late too late. They're a company, not a lemonade stand, there are deadlines. Remember when all of you guys were saying that after the announcement event?
---
Not a huge fan, but I can use that Greatsword to finish my Ganondorf cosplay :P
---
Well I hope they will go this route instead of putting resources into a whole new map which is mostly just dead after 1-2 weeks because they don't have any replayability or reason to go back and make better use of their time and assets...
---
The key here is that by releasing raid wings, fractals, and legendaries with Living World they don't technically qualify as expansion features : ^ )
---
They are not obligated to release it at a certain time. They have been consistent but never promised anything. Stop complaining.
---
&gt; Elites are not happening. Period. Until next expac. 
---
So never then.
---
What sort of discussion would that promote? In my eyes that would just be a thread of people sending complaints into the void.
---
you are on wrong sub, please fo to /r/Guildwars2rants instead.
---
Yup, they persist.
---
As for the 2nd question, the best answer I can give you is "because reasons", probably some oversight during development that never got enough priority in the pipeline to be reworked.
---
Okay to be fair...they always patch at 9am PST. If you've played long enough you would understand that this patch is indeed "late". If you've played long enough you also know that this isn't abnormal and you don't get pissed once you lower your expectations. :)
---
cool, I now have 2 unoccupied char slots. What do I make?
---
Seriously I’d like to express how pissed I am. What a fool I was to take today off
---
We all agree with you. Changing away from the expac format only makes sense if they are going to  remove major expac only features.
---
Most of us have just agreed that is dumb. and the sign of a very unhealthy game.
---
9am PST happens when this comment is 20 hours and 39 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/a8qH8pkmI
---
I'm a bot, if you want to send feedback, please comment below or send a PM.
---
&gt; I don't see a megathread for ranting either.
---
Neither there should be one. ANET has released plenty of "proper releases" in its lifetime, the release day is still going and they've already announced on Twitter that they're working on it. Do something better with you time.
---
Guild Wars 3 confirmed
---
That's fine. No sarcasm (in that specific comment) either.
---
It's common, but they don't always patch at 9am PST. There have been plenty of cases where it was closer to 10 or 11, or even after noon. There's even been one or two cases where they had to delay due to weather or power outages.
---
It would be one thing if they had made a verbal promise to patch at 9 AM regularly, but it's a bit unfair to be flat out pissed at the company for now adhering to a schedule that you have created in your own mind based on the perceived common release time.
---
What is your definition of a "incapable of having a proper release"?
---
For real, take a walk in the woods and calm down.
---
Cute
---
Who exactly? (:
---
There are a few thread already that allows you to discuss frustrations, including the 'delay announcement' thread. This sort of content isn't needed, if it has no relevance to GW2, it's being removed.
---
I have no idea why this is not done
---
Can you give context?
---
ok boomer
---
Umm... Since when do they test releases?
---
I can't log until tuesday so sad
---
Ctrl+v
---
&gt; let those people leave the game in peace
---
Gods yes...  
---
But you know they won't. This addiction to ragging on a game they don't play (and probably no longer have installed) is just bizarre.
---
they dont like money.
---
They used to but they got fired
---
Since when has not releasing your content based on a time zone 8+ hours ahead of your own been "inconsiderate"?
---
Well yeah cuz every time they share an idea that the community hates people get completely barbaric.
---
Töd is a form of the German word for death, so in a way it's accurate enough.
---
What are you saying we got build ~~templates~~ loadouts!!!
---
I wasn't referring to that. I think it's very obvious they don't seem to be very interested in catering to the "veteran" playerbase. You made the claim that it  "can backfire quite a bit." 
---
Is there any economic evidence that it can backfire? Or are you postulating based on the assumption that veteran players are somehow more important because you see yourself as part of that group, and don't want to accept the possibility that your continued support of the game might not be in their immedate interest?
---
If you can find some kind of academic sources that reasonably show a corrolation between lack of support for "veteran" consumers and lessened market share, i'm all ears.
---
The less than two month gap between the prologue and Episode 1 is a *huge* improvement from Season 4 if they can keep it up.
---
People really loved the atmosphere and the diversity. It was also rather unique in terms of environments and the best music ever.

---
&gt;### Bug Fixes
---
&gt;- Fixed an issue in which the Gem Store displayed an incorrect number when it failed to load the price of an account upgrade item.
---
Aaand it has a shiny new launcher! Love it.
---
&gt; If post made by a nickname pisses people, they can switch to another one.
---
I'd say it could be more along the lines of if a post pisses people off - there's a guarantee someone will take it too far and start either doxxing or harassing them.
---
I'm actually surprised this wasn't an option before today.
---
i have to say that i think its important for the future health (and fun) of the game to have face/hair/etc styles updated, like sylvari, could so use more plant hairstyles now, almost all the hard work is done for the dev team by nature :D millions of years of hard work of evolution, all they have to do is vaguely copy and re-render an existing plant form:) voila, Bromeliad hair
---
Patch ready for download.
---
THEY CHANGED THE LAUNCHER
---
New launcher with the update btw
---
Not documented:
---
* New launcher art!
---
I will gladly pass on quizzing people for several minutes just to see if they will match everyone's arbitrary requirements. Getting to play the game is somehow more important to me than playing job interview. You get back to me when you get something more concrete, okay?
---
&gt; The Merchandise Collector achievement is now slightly easier to complete.
---
Slightly. HA!
---
Hmm none of the skill/trait changes they mentioned the last month or so went life.
---
I really hope for a non asian content expansion. I never could be familiar with asian skins or areas like wow pandaria or aion or archeage. They should keep the art style and map design as the whisper of the dark new area or path of fire expansion in general. It's my personal opinion.
---
It looks so cool! Damn nice they actually updated it
---
The rework for Season 3 and 4 dailies is a much welcomed QoL. The daily tab was slowly getting out of control.
---
[ posted on ](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/92410):
---
&gt; 
---
Oooh, new loader, too!
---
Because it is a content patch, not a balance patch.
---
&gt; Living World Season 3 and Living World Season 4 daily achievements have been condensed into new achievement categories. Each day will offer daily achievements for one map from the season, cycling through each map in order of their release.
---
I know this is such a minor change, but it makes me really happy. Begone UI clutter!
---
With old char select screen.
---
When the gem store notes are buggier than the content
---
I'M SCREAMING HERE
---
finally some content
---
What's that huge file at the end of the download?
---

What do you mean freedom of speech doesn't apply to businesses. A business cannot prevent you from speaking anymore than a government can. They can restrict access to their platform, but your " entitlement to complain" as you said is protected speech.
---
Proof that anet does read reddit threads, at least xD
---
If you're sitting there quizzing people, then you have no clue what I just said.
---
❄️🌲🎇PERFECT FOR WINTER!🎇🌲❄️
---
No new character screen though. It's so... whack. 
---
The Icebrood Saga has its own mastery category, its own launcher, but we still have an Elonian desert character select screen? ?_?
---
&gt; If the only thing stopping you from killing a boss are the numbers on your weapon even though you excecute perfect gameplay then it it's not the raid that is difficult, it's the game design being bad.
---
But that isn't true most of the time (at least in FFXIV). Most players simply do not execute perfect gameplay and then it FEELS as if you need better gear (which of course can work). Also gearing in FFXIV is pretty easy and there are good "catch-up" patches.
---
If anything you should see gear progression not as a hindrance but as an assistance that helps you if you or your group just aren't good enough. I'm not saying that every game that has gear progression does this well but ideally it should work like that.
---
No new character screen though. It's so... whack.
---
 Roller Beetle: Mount endurance is no longer set to zero when mounting up.    
---
You never put release notes up before the release. What if they need to delay the release too tomorrow because they found a major but last minute?
---
thats it? half of the notes are black lion shit as always.
---
Yes, thats what I meant. They can moderate their forums all they want, they can hide behind fake names, they will never be immune from complaints.
---
 The Merchandise Collector achievement is now **slightly** easier to complete
---
&gt; Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.

I fully understand why it got removed and am OK with that, but plz don't tell me I didn't respect rules or should have checked recent posts ... others were posted at the same time.

&gt; Roller Beetle: Mount endurance is no longer set to zero when mounting up.
---
Forget everything else, this is the best upgrade they've ever done.
---
Roller beetle not having its endurance set to 0. Now it wont feel like a punishment to use it.
---
OH GOD YES
---
...now they just need to slap a new background into the character screen. What the hell.
---
Depends how they structure the meta-achievement - if you can choose a specific material as a reward it could actually help combat burnout, although it will still probably be at least somewhat slower overall one way or another.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
...design
---
As someone still doing quick dailies in Bloodstone Fen and Lake Doric (peach tree), I feel personally attacked..
---
Here's the thing.  It's not a workaround.  It's exactly what they intended.  If they had not intended this to be possible, they wouldn't have allowed you to copy them as plain text.  It would have only linked to chat the way linking items does, in which case you would have had to craft a workaround that allowed you to see the plain text code behind it. 
---
What they have us instead is paid but limited server storage, so you can save some templates to their server to use across characters when you switch between multiple computers to play (which was a huge pain in the ass in gw1 might i add. I was a mission runner with around 25 + builds for each of my assassin, warrior, dervish, monk and ranger.  When i played on my laptop i had to carry a flash drive) and free unlimited local storage.  Could they have made the local storage easier with a checkbox that let you choose which you were saving to?  Sure.  But this isn't a workaround it unintended feature.  They want you to save them locally.
---
Sure...
---
Who exactly. I'm seeing this claim multiple times here without actual examples of proof
---
Plenty of companies announce release dates for patches and expansions months in advance.
---
It's not what they *usually* do, but they have snuck balance changes into living story releases before, most recently the final episode of season 4.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/76298/game-update-notes-may-14-2019
---
That excuse doesn't apply anymore; seeing that stats got overhauled...
---
&gt;They mentioned how many skills they had to do for Weaver and what a nightmare this was.
---
Yeah, content is such a nightmare to make! Must be why they only make skins nowadays.
---
And the proposed PvP changes still isn't in this patch...
---
Tell that to the people who got laid off.  This game will die, If it hasnt already.  The theme park rides wont sustain a large enough playerbase for much longer.  Theyre done unless they have already started working on some sandbox elements.
---
&gt;* Living World Season 3 and Living World Season 4 daily achievements have been condensed into new achievement categories. Each day will offer daily achievements for one map from the season, cycling through each map in order of their release.
---
&gt;* Living World Season 3 and Living World Season 4 daily achievements have had their rewards increased to compensate for the reduced availability of daily achievements for a specific map.
---
It was about time they added rotating dailies for these maps AND increased the rewards. I suggested a similar system before so it's good to see they actually changed it.
---
Anet should be able to track who said what, if Anet tries to shelter them due to a bad post, then Anet as a whole comes under attack
---
Not many scenarios where we, the gamers, feel like we've depreciated our rights to consequences on the forum
---
And Anet forums have a pretty good track record of not going off the rails
---
It updates each day I think, not each week.
---
I feel you. We've been stuck with the EotN one since its launch in GW1, it's impossible now to experience the relaxing Faction or Nightfall ones.
---
This is ridiculous. No new fractals and raids, yet new content still being released in the Gem Store. Of course. I suppose this is what happens when there is no subscription and the gem store is the primary way they make money.
---
Patch is 90% updates to the trading post and they couldnt release it on time? lul
---
You will never get official announcement. Anet just wants you to keep playing and buying gems for all eternity.
---
expansion lite
---
Why?
---
I wish they would release half as many armor skins or outfits as they do the stupid mount skins. I love my characters i dress them up etc. but not once have I been tempted to buy a mount skin; I simply don’t care about mounts. (Hides)
---
In such cases anet is an arbiter in a case they are involved. It's very unhealthy situation.
---
What changed?
---
When you log in and unlock episode 1, the border for the unlock pop-up shows the PoF logo with the purple twister. lol... gj QA
---
Don't forget the cooking 500. Such content, much wow. Which was also gemstone monetized,
---
Damn, they could at least give us an option to switch between classic, HoT and PoF ones then.
---
This is the shortest content patch notes I've seen in GW2.

Horray for our dung beetles not being shit!

*Patch Notes
---
I always forget about the peach tree! I had my revenant parked there for like...a year.
---
I look at the launcher far more than I do the character select screen lol.
---
I changed menu music back to HoT and Vanilla because of that  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Customized\_soundtrack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Customized_soundtrack)
---
There is the chapter itself, and all features within are tipically not in patch notes, but for you to find out. So yeah, there's more.
---
There are many examples. I just called some of the more epic/bigger ones.
---
unless for some weird reason you think that expansion level content means new mechanics, new features, elite specs, raids, fractals, swiss for sPvP, or WvW alliances :)
---
Thread removed: Re-posting is not allowed.
---
Dude, you can change the character select screen music. I have every single on of them on playlist. From GW Prophecies to Eye of the North, to HoT.
---
Your post reeks of arrogance.
---
Once you start playing regularly and get into high kp tiers, you'll know the difference between average 50kp and 200kp groups.
---
Not having new fractals or legendaries bums me out more than anything else ANET has done in recent days.  I recognize that not everyone cares for those elements of the game, but you cannot ignore how popular both fractals and leg weapons are to many players.  Sadface.
---
Yeah I wonder why? OP's is blue.
---
Central Tyria masteries are randomly locked: https://i.imgur.com/jgxWID3.png
---
Suffer through it the hard way, coward!
---
(I hated doing that achievement but I was too stubborn to cheat)
---
NO thanks, I evolved my Magmadar to Magmortar.
---
Anet really has a "guys, you can't expect us to do everything at once." mentality.
---
And yet other game devs seem to do that just fine.
---
You shouldnt have to think, you should know.  Because they should be communicating.  Which they are bad at.  And whats wrong with " content \[that caters\] to what you're looking for" .  Thats why i still come to this reddit.  To see if they pulled their heads out of their asses and stated making some sand box elements instead of more theme park rides.  So I can have a reason to play a game again that I invested more than 4k into.
---
I'd like to know as well.  Is it easier just because you only need one of those expensive skins or was there another change?
---
Uh... what? One, I'm not obligated to make gem store purchases if I don't want to. Second, I payed for my account and both expansions were paid for. I more than plenty have proven my support for the game and have paid for my right to play the game until I deem fit.
---
Heres the fact tho, **Anet has ALWAYS been the arbiter**
---
Unless you think its somehow more reasonable for people to go after that person, including Doxxing them. Its a BUSINESS, and will always be handled this way.
---
This isnt some sort of power tripping fantasy for gamers to get riled up and start rioting against a person IRL. Thats not right - and you know it
---
Selecting one helmet from the Visage of the Khan-Ur now unlocks the skins for all three armor classes. Players who have unlocked one of the three skins can unlock the others by traveling to Lion's Arch, Grothmar Valley, or Bjora Marches.
---
so you no longer need 24.000g just 8.000g
---
Sandbox Elements for me
---
lol
---
Or the obvious "let us choose our background" option?
---
They did say they were separating pve and pvp now. This is a pve update
---
my thoughts exactly.
---
Um no they added in a whole new map.
---
I would say WoW has a much less steep learning curve and the bar for being competent in WoW is MUCH lower.
---
But then again it really depends on the specific player. WoW's combat is much slower and easier to digest for a lot of players. We still  have to keep explaining to people here what CC is.
---
&gt;.&gt; Too real
---
It'll cut .3 sec off my key runs! :)
---
Legion, actually. I didn't raid in Legion though. My last raid was.... Warlords, I think. Gul'dan.
---
&gt;They stated prior that they wanted to achieve a faster release cadence with season 5
---
Remember when they released LS4E3 and said that they had mastered new technology to make releases faster, then released every subsequent episode at an even slower rate?
---
Focusing on mediocre storyline
---
 Between this and the skimmer movement changes I am very happy with Anet's direction on mounts.
---
The rest of the game not so much.
---
"And we were okay with 2/3/3 in regards of the game at first, that's no point. The limitations are just there because they set them themselves. Not because they're actual limitations."
---
I never said those were 'limitations', I just said that they already have a very neat 3x3 pattern set up with the playable classes.
---
oh look, my new axe
---
&gt; It's on business to learn how to deal with this profesionally.
---
You did imply that companies should learn to deal with the responses in a professional manner. I assume professional in this context doesn't include throwing the complaints straight in the garbage.
---
Looks like they implemented pretty much what you suggested!
---
Well you keep assuming shit I didn't even say. I never said I beat anything in 3 weeks. Why the hell do you keep putting words in places they never were in the first place?
---
Taste 1000 ASSES! 
---
Pretty much that. You can't even block those shits.
---
It's Astralaria lol
---
Indeed
---
That's bold to put a modified legendary skin on the gem store.
---
The collection only requires 12/15 skins now to complete, so you don't need any Visage's actually.
---
Patch size is 674mb
---
I'm sorry, you have to do it all again.
---
I like the background and music, it's just the awful lighting makes it really difficult to take simple screenshots of your character's armour.
---
Yeah, I was hoping to see the [Revenant x Template] interaction fixed...
---
As a Mesmer + Rev main, I take offense to this comment
---
&gt; I suggested a similar system before
---
ANet possibly listened to feedback? :O
---
This isn't all that big a change for most serious purposes (except maybe some really fancy mount/dismount shenanigans) but it's huge quality of life improvement for beetle users.
---
That's the plan. It still needs that item connected to the meta (or the method described above)
---
&gt; It's not that far fetched though.
---
But still misinformation.
---
ssssshhhhhhhHHHHHHHH
---
This post...it is just an invitation to make you look like a fool...isn't it?
---
I can oblige if you really want that. Just say the word.
---
cheap astralaria. very nice anyway
---
And yet no login screen those cheeky fucks -.-
---
I have 4 Dailies in Dragon Fall, each gives 3 exotic chests so you get a total of 12 chests = 60 motes.
---
In theory, thats 60 motes every 6 days now.
---
But honestly, I dont like this at all. Regardless of currency payout, I'd rather be able to play whatever map I like and get dailies there.
---
Thats it `?
---
Gonna take even longer for me to get Vision now I guess
---
"Hey Anet here, take these new mount skins we release every few weeks .. oh and have a new outfit too.. you want new hair option? Sorry no time for that. Also about those raids and fractals .. dont expect them for the next two years. thxbye."
---
Why is that?
---
You're making wild assumptions
---
Devs are USING THEIR INGAME TAGS, you KNOW who you're talking to and Anet KNOWS what they said. If you have an issue with someone, u KNOW who you're talking to. The only reason you want someone's real name so so when shit goes sideways, people can doxx and stalk them IRL or on social media.
---
Tell me one reason why you would even need their full names to begin with ?!
---
Anet has, and will always be the arbiter. You knowing the full name or not will not change that. You can identify them, you can report them, you can ask anet to do something about it. You can post it on reddit and demand answers because you know who that person is and how to identify them.
---
This isnt some anonymous person that you don't know. If you have an issue, **use the user tag**
---
This isnt some randomly generated numbers that keeps cycling, this isnt "Anonymous #445632"
---
BoneSKINNEEEEEEER
---
Just let them cry. It's the only catharsis they got left.
---
And some hype musiic that isn't slow and quiet
---
The tab is locked but the masteries themselves still work.
---
ah thats much better
---
Anyone know what the new helm and shoulders look like?
---
On the other hamd you are assuminganet to be sincere.
---
The EotN music sure is hype though
---
I was farming kralkatite and diorite by doing dailies (I can only play 30 minutes every few days). Now I'll have to get lucky when I log in and hope that I got the dailies for those specific maps...
---
But you're setting yourself on fire with overload holo mode, IT'S FINE
---
Same. A new character select screen would be cool, but I see it for at most 5 seconds at a time unless there’s server issues.
---
You said you can talk about wow raids implying you raid. You said its all just gear and not skill. Because raiders can "outgear" the raid in a month that means everyone can beat it in about 3 week time. Average raider doing a full clear in 3 week time would be a logical conclusion.
---
I am a programmer by profession, and I would upvote you more than once if I could.
---
something similar existed. Gw had instance leaders. They removed it. Why? because if the instance leader DC'd, everyone else did too.
---
Get this higher up
---
I hope the new Springer skin comes with custom sounds.
---
I would serieusly view this whole saga differently if we would have gotten elite specs. I would learn now synergies, new playstyles on 9 characters, do the story multiple time ans revisite old metas, dungeons and raids with new cool playstyles. And to do this all in a snowy xpac like world would be amazing. But now reality checks in: 2 hours of story playthrough with one of my standard dps builds, looking at some of the rewards that prob wont add anything to my established fashion wars, one run through the strike mission hoping it will be like a raid, but it wont. Logging out and waiting 3 months, kidding myself thinking "aw heck, maybe next episode brings something xpac worthy and it will be fun again".
---
Yeah but that's part of what makes the game fun. Not much to do if you just gems-&gt;gold everything
---
Likely was
---
Unless you assume they test it only once .\_.
---
This is prob more like a compulsive "OH SHIT, DID WE FORGET SOMETHING ?!"
---
Game dev tingles.
---
I'm just going to live with the disappointment that we aren't getting any more until we get a reveal. I don't want to get my hopes up for more. :(
---
PoF hero points aren't red either... why would they change it now?
---
Excellent
---
Yeah, I remember, kicking the group leader would put everyone out, fun memes.
---
But it's possible to fix that. Wont happen, but possible nonetheless, raids don't kick you out of you kick the instance owner.
---
Kirkland Astralaria
---
&gt; would be a logical conclusion.
---
Sure. Believe what you want then.
---
Expansion-like features are finally here bois.
---
there was another reason it was removed. Leaders would abuse the position by kicking party members at the end of dungeons, so they could invite their own guild to get the rewards
---
I’m getting that too.
---
You can easily farm a lot more of those by just playing the map for 30 minutes. Do the hearts. Run multiple characters. I can easily farm a stack of each in a day or two. Except Kalkatite. To get more than what the hearts sell you need time to dedicate for meteors.
---
No, I'm assuming that this will be handled just like it is handled in the business world.
---
You have a bad call service from customer support ? Ask for a name or number, they will give you the first name and how to identify them. THEN you can take it up with management or corporate.
---
WHAT ISNT OKAY, is demanding a full name so you can take personal revenge on them outside of the business structure.
---
**Its a power tripping fantasy you're having, over something as simple as devs not wanting to use their full name because they don't feel comfortable**
---
**Why ?!**
---
**Because of people like you.**
---
What’s the shield in the video? Thanks.
---
People told me that Icebrood Construct's updated fight was one of the three new bosses. So glad to see that was wrong.
---
I was just wondering that hah!
---
If the celestial axe turns out to be the same as the one in GW1, I need it.
---
Yeah, it would be cool. But I'm not angry about it. Maybe a bit disappointed but not like that's gonna ruin my mood or enjoyment of the game.
---
Unlike some people.
---
please dont say that. dont give them any ideas please. should be included in the game by default....
---
I want the stick.
---
some players cant buy instance node...
---
you know a-net seems to only care about blacklion whales 
---
well i would too ... easy money
---
Amethyst aegis
---
Yep .. thats important..
---
This isn't a balance patch.  This is a content release patch with a new episode.
---
So does that mean the comment actually referred to hair styles and not raids / fractals?
---
You're thinking "tests" is one thing. It's not. There's QA testing, dev testing, User Acceptance testing, load testing, integration tests, and deployment tests. 
---
More than likely the things you're thinking of were tested many times during the development. This is more likely quick load tests, integration tests, and tests that the deployments/distribution are working.
---
You just put your guild's discord address on reddit. Twice.
---
&gt;They are not chaotic fights where anything can happen at any moment but carefully choreographed dance routines.
---
That's true of pretty much everything AI controlled in any game because the "brain" is basically a set of routines it repeats.
---
Im perfectly fine with it, im just a tad sick of it is all
---
&gt; Each **day** will offer daily achievements for one map from the season, cycling through each map in order of their release.
---
Grothmar is now an icebrood saga map per the patch notes.
---
It's always been that way for me. Broken since '12.
---
Woops!!! give me a quick sec to edit..
---
Exactly. I suggested this long ago and was thinking about doing it again, but had no hope it'd actually happen. I'm rly happy they did.
---
Personally, I’m fine with it. Never do any raids, fractals are terrible with the instabilities - haven’t done any T4 for the longest time, and I’m so over the legendary grind.
---
This a game changer. Now running from tp to crafting stations is like 3 secs ;-;
---
Eire music in the Erie Forrest loops incorrectly restarting every 2/3 seconds.
---
Omg yes!! Finally !!!
---
holy shit, i'm quit playing a while ago but this makes me so sad.
---
And as always, a patch note line does not equal a patch note line. The whole new episode is summed up in 2 lines so there is no spoiler and we can discover the new map, new mechanics, new masteries, new story, new bosses, new items, and many things that total for much more than the BL update. BL patch notes are the opposite : extremely detailed so we know exactly what we can buy, every changed pixel gets a patch note line.
---
The warrior change to banner is a little one but a good one, thank you for that
---
Any indicator of the home instance node having two version again ? Don't feel like blowing 6k magic and 30g extra this time.
---
any news of a build templates rework?or they will remain shitty?
---
Forget testing on release day, more often than not I am testing a program for the 18th time within an hour of it being released. So while it may not be an "Industry Standard" type of situation, I would agree that it is standard procedure to do a final last minute check before deploying.
---
What is historic weapon skin?
---
Web Developer here. This stuff happens. No launch is ever perfect. Close to perfect? Maybe.
---
Erm, you can still do that tho.
---
It was never a instance leader thing, it was a instance owner, if he left, everyone would be kicked. but if he wanted to kick someone he'd still have to vote like it is now. He never had the ability to kick without voting, also that can still be done provided you are playing with 2 more premade players. The workaround is like raids, to only be able to kick while out of combat. What I'm suggesting is exactly the same commander feature to be used in 5 man parties. If there is a tag, he controls the group, if there is no tag, the vote system is displayed.
---
It looks amazing!!!!
---
In every other industry I always know full name of the employee that's providing me service, so I can complain or compliment them. Only gaming industry pretends they need to be protected from confrontation and criticism.
---
Anet is bad business practices example in many areas, customer communication is one of the most visible one. Anet wants to avoid responsibility whenever they can - that's why they left reddit, that's why they are hiding behind silly nicknames now. "Oops, silly me Dreamy Butterfly for breaking your game. Whoopsie doopsie".
---
Anet is not your friend, they are business. The only reason they exist is money. They put up a fasade of friendly, positive company, but when you look how they interact with customers, you notice they hate doing this. They prefer their echo chamber, where they can safely create stories and share muffins all day long. And for years they avoid responsibility for their fuck ups. Why? Because of people like you.
---
Another proof that this was gonna be a proper expansion, but got cut as such and became whatever this is.
---
What bothers me more is that they changed the position of the icon, my muscle memory is going nuts, i always click on the guild icon when i wanna open the trading post. ._.
---
Well yeah that I get. So when I went to that area I expected the masteries to unlock. But it shows it is still locked while it is allowing experience to be put in.. I posted the screenshots again so you can see..
---
Best thread of every Anet patch.
---
You have a kinda off view of how videogame development works.
---
It's an imposter celestial axe.
---
Can u post new one?
---
Thank you for the clarification!
---
And where does it say there can't be balance included? Especially since we know there's balance stuff coming from quite decent communication in beginning of november...
---
0 to 100 real quick. Also how is the game dead. Youre in the game on launch day.
---
At the very beginning of the story, when talking to Marboring, she sounded as if she was underwater or behind a wall.
---
Got me more excited it had any right to.
---
Nice ... but I already have more axe skins than I can possibly use. Even if we somehow get quad wielding I would still have too many.
---
Despite my previous post about gemstore skins not necessarily being better than in game. I have to concede defeat here. The obvioius comparison is to Astralaria and Astralaria's stowed form is pretty disappointing.
---
All that aside ... where are the new trident skins? :(
---
I would love them to not create new music and put Eotn theme in there.   
---
There can't be any better fit than this.
---
As I understand it, the mastery is locked until you finish the story.
---
Can't blame them with weaver. I loved them for it as an ele main, but I worried a little bit about their sanity as well. 
---
I mean, sword on itself is quite something given the aa chains and 4 attunements, but *30 dual skills on top??*
---
&gt;Strike Missions are easily the peak difficulty this map possesses&lt; 
---
And like that you've lost me. 
---
Rip raids and challenging content, Ill miss you dear friend.
---
Yoof. I can see this not being so bad if they step up the rate at which episodes are released; if we get a monthly episode then this gets *much* more palatable.
---
If not... well, there's gonna be a lot of unhappy people.
---
It makes me wonder if we'll hear about GW3 soon. We have no idea how long this Living World season will last yet, and there's no expansion announcements thus far, so only time will tell.
---
Yeah no doubt lol.  I did the same thing last time.
---
"Weekly Strike Mission" and here we go!
---
It means that it can start with 100% -- previously, mounting up on the beetle automatically drained that endurance bar to zero. Now mounting the beetle just doesn't change that endurance at all.
---
Why that bit of nuance in the mechanics matters is here is because mounts share an endurance pool, so if you drain that to zero on one mount, then quickly swap to the roller beetle, that endurance bar will still be recovering.
---
Across the board though, it's a massive upgrade to the usability of the beetle.
---
It's not purple, it's blavender.
---
Matches the celestial compass from a while back
---
Path of Exile would like to say hi. GGG has, even before joining Tencent, presented a model sustained around the idea of no sub but cash shop.
---
GW2 is just horrible managed. We live in an era where subs put people off, and fair transaction and sustainance models exist that doesn't involve paying monthly.
---
same
---
The world of GW2 today is not the same world that it was in 2012. The overarching story is literally filled with magic-eating dragons and huge pulses of magical energy flooding the world and being reabsorbed by various uber powerful creatures, over and over again. Our characters have been exposed to enough magical energy that we turned into a ley energy "elemental" for a brief moment. We've been back and forth through the mists, we've **died**, we've gone backwards and forwards in time, we've gone to frickin spaaaaaaaace.
---
But you're worried that glowy bits disrupt the lore? Hah. If we weren't glowing at this point, that'd be a bigger breach of the lore.
---
I posted this above, but I'll just quote myself here, because I don't think y'all are really understanding the insane story that we're a part of:

---
It's kralkatite that is the issue. The others are easily obtainable.
---
According to the devs there won't be new fractals/raids/legendarys in the next episodes. I specifically asked that because at first I got the answer "not in this episode, no"
---
They seemed pretty focussed on the new strike missions - which btw made a good first impression, definitely harder than the Icebrood Construct.
---
The comment about something not being a priority was regarding hair styles.
---
Friendly reminder: Don't forget to report this bug (I think it's a bug) in an official way.
---
That's such a nice looking skin, damn.  Stow animation, and trail and everything.
---
I suppose that’s essentially the idea behind the Asuran architecture. Even their armour’s vaguely Aztec in inspiration, at least in the first game. They lost a bit of that influence in the armour designs in GW2 though in my opinion.
---
But Charr and Norn lore!
---
Finally, some content!
---
No, the author only referring to the "The reason? In the development of new content, it has never been prioritized, probably not in the future" part being in context with that we dont got any new hairs. The first part with not raids/fractals still holds true.
---
Destiny 2 also converts some of their story bosses into group content.
---
I took off the whole week. Just to be sure.  :P
---
Ah yes, the expansion-worthy content I have long awaited
---
Pretending to not understand how context works? How very 2009. (yawn)
---
Had to restart the first mission. I got the scepter, learned the mastery, and still couldn't get out of the room. Raven statue kept telling me to look for the scepter.. but I already had it. All the instructions were completed (last one being "find a way out") and didn't get new ones.
---
Relog and then restarting the whole story step solved it.
---
You probably should read the whole thing.
---
A - you can already do that if you are premade with 2 others.
---
B - what I'm suggesting is the same as raids, and in raids you can't kick while someone is in combat.
---
Fair Enough. Would be great seeing interviews with Butterfly Kingdom on the name tag.

Sent you a pm. (:
---
As a dungeoneer this brings me sadistic pleasure that the raiders and fotm runners won’t have new content for a while. 
---
Yeah it sucks and I empathize with the people that are upset by it and my above comment is mostly in jest. 
---
Anet doesn’t know or care what the community desires and will just shoehorn their stuff in and bask in the praise of the people that do enjoy it and ignore all the frustration and criticism by everyone else.
---
Gw2 has a skeleton team to support the game under a new project is announced. It's clear now that the only teams working on this game is the Living Story teams.
---
No Legendary weapon, and no Raid or Fractal (which seems are to be replaced by more casual Strike Missions). Besides that it's pretty much the same you've seen in S3 and S4.
---
Hear hear!
---
Lol we're inching closer to legendary level weapons in the cash store, this game is a fucking joke
---
I'm gonna suspect the hardware problem since it is a newly built pc.
---
maybe check your CPU and GPU if they operating in the correct temperature range?
---
They want an expansion I think
---
I wasn't aware that I could login to gw1, good to know
---
it's not misinformation. he used the words "unlikely" and "possible" which indicate a *likely* but not *guaranteed* outcome. if he had said it was "definitely" going to happen that way or a surety, *that* would have been misinformation.
---
See you guys in 4 months for one day of story again.
---
If you wait for all dialogue from brahm in the first instance, and then explore the other room/interact with things, you cannot leave the house, stalling the first instance and requiring a restart. (Or maybe if you unlock the first mastery too fast it stalls, I dunno)
---
finally
---
Poor Lion on UI is just Sonic the Hedgehog now....-\_\_-
---
I'm guessing the idea is to try and combat the extreme spreading of the playerbase across so much content.
---
Obligatory does this happen with other games?
---
My \[Rytlock\]([https://puu.sh/EGv7h/84129015d4.png](https://puu.sh/EGv7h/84129015d4.png)) did the same thing!
---
Complain for karma 🙄
---
I've played Modern warfare, Monster Hunter and league of legends and they all run perfect. Only guild wars gives me this problem
---
Too much white. Needs more comor on the left side to balance it out.
---
I got it. I can send a screenshot tomorrow.
---
Aww man - I was hoping for the GW1 Celestial Axe updated. Got excited for nothing. 😭
---
If you want to be left behind while the rest of the world wakes up its your struggle not mine, anyways yea of course that is possible but there are countless amounts of shills in gw2 reddit and other mmo ones, I have been doing this dance for a long time kiddo and I do not need to justify shit to you regardless of what I KNOW.
---
Because in a game that has the slowest development ever, anything tickles their pickle.
---
And dark
---
The reason you don't see lots of people praising Anet here is because they're too busy enjoying and playing the game lol
---
Maybe an unhealthy interest at the most because stalking is so much more than just checking up on someone whos work you care about.  I'm not saying it isn't creepy, nor am I saying that a stalker wouldn't be all up into such things, but actual stalking involves a whole lot more.
---
Actual stalking really requires obsessiveness and/or delusion on the part of the stalker because of the time and effort it takes to do... Following someone around takes a lot of time out of the stalker's day.  Online stalking involves a major time investment as well because the stalker isn't simply reading the victim's postings, they're likely also doing some level of analysis and rereading them obsessively of course.  It's a massive time and emotional investment on the part of the stalker that goes well beyond looking someone up on job sites and such, and it's well beyond the realm of the vast majority of people.  
---
The way I see people looking up the LinkedIn profiles and following the devs on twitter and such is closer to the way people follow musicians and actors.  The devs bringing us this game are our rock stars; Even though we very often have complaints and criticisms about their work, they are ultimately bringing us something we want and for some people that's going to pull up some extra interest, maybe even unhealthy interest, and that will eventually include some actual stalkers too, but for the majority of people it's more like celeb gossip stuff than anything dangerous or particularly unhealthy.  
---
I assume this is also why most companies have their employees use gamer handles on forums and such, something I always sort of wondered about with Anet's people.  Must have been a company policy thing, and I hope we do get some more communication with them for it.
---
Yeah, it's the same formula since S3. And if that is the start into the "Saga", there is nothing else to be hoped for. If they've had anything big, they would've blown it.
---
PSA: Reading patch notes help!
---
Thanks
---
The story really isn't made to be played with multiple players, you have this where the other players are basically not there or just whisps that basically do nothing. Or you kill enemies too fast and the instance bugs out, happened for example for my friends and I when Balthazar shows up to kill Vlast, we burst him down before he could finish his speech and couldn't continue.
---
I didnt like the previous. This one is excellent
---
can't he change the LFG tho? Every time i've had this happen they would always cancel the LFG before they leave (if they even leave the party)
---
Bonus if they have Debra Wilson (the voice of Jormag) do it in her [Whitney Houston impression](https://youtu.be/p2FnunslP1E)
---
You know it's coming, pal.
---
I think most interested players have stayed and learnt the time since it's so regular. The rest that refused has left. We need new blood to get a new "WHAT TIME IS PATCH" train going.
---
Boo. Please don't! Keep it the way it is
---
seems like it's bugged. My husband sees it but I don't and we've done the same things so far.
---
When I was doing raids, I made the mistake of letting it slip that I was IRL a female. The next two days of gaming was these 2 guys adding themselves to my party (despite asking people to not accept) to spam penis jokes. I had to leave the game for a month, and I havent returned to raids. Mods never got back to me about the report that I sent in email form with screenshots. THey dont care.
---
There’s a nice red bar, been looking at it for over half an hour now and it’s slowly moving towards the right.
---
You're right. I miss-typed
---
No, instead of 2 hours of content and
---
plenty of other projects in developement, it's now 30 mins of content and nothing being in developement 🤔
---
it has a custom spawn/despawn
---
It's a bug
---
I'm the other way around. I use the `-autologin` flag, so I just double-click the game icon and then click the “Play” button. That's like two seconds of screen time. However, when I play, I very frequently swap characters, so though I only spend a second or two on the character selection screen, i see it far more than I see the launcher.
---
Anet: "omg how funny, you guys are the best" *thread locked*
---
Turned on the high performance and got one stutter and no more. Went into the new story instance where it was pretty bad earlier, but haven’t had anything. 
---
Also did check if the voltages went low and they seemed ok when I got the one stutter
---
That's a great idea.
---
That's impossible. They delayed the patch for 2 hours for additional testing.
---
my mule mesmer stands there since the release of the map :D
---
i finished the chapter story in ~25 minutes...
---
Lets make PSA of every patch note verse.
---
Me first:
---
**PSA: fixed server crash**
---
Everyone disappears as part of the story in that instance, not seeing your buddy probably was a specifically designed feature in that case. Did you listen to the dialogue ?
---
"gated"
---
Patience. Don't try and burn through all the content in the same evening it's released. Explore the map and take part in the new events, instead.
---
It has custom footfalls as well
---
It's not like you can't easily get the masteries with your alts accounts too.
---
you can have an option enabled in the chat box to tell you how many hours you've been playing
---
Thank you :) I wanted to make my usual greatsword, but i already got caught up in the details so much and the sword would've added an extra few hours
---
Yeah, weird. With that, the Rollerbeetle has become the #1 mount and Jackal and the Raptor are now ultra niche. What an odd change.
---
How do I get through the first part of the Silence episode? I've upgraded the Raven mastery and yet I can't seem to actually get through the door?
---
Or they left
---
Yes, and if you want to train the right mastery for this weekly Strike Mission, start by exping the 3rd one.
---
i wish
---
Good to see this!
---
Is there a new episode out? No hate pls
---
I was mad, at the time, that the only good rewards were gated behind hard content surrounded by a toxic AF community. I would 100% log in and do it again for the lelz.
---
That post didn't age well.
---
yep I know, it couldn't have been just norn, it needs to go with the trend of toxic masculinity and show men as bad people when actually humans altogether are the problem. One day the other side will need men, then they will ask why we don't really care anymore... :)
---
They should change the pink to a different color, like dark blue.
---
Same here.
---
What? The only thing awful about it is that the lighting makes your characters look ten times better than they ever will in-game.
---
Did you finish the prologue story?
---
Same for me, its because I finished the mastery on another character... I just restarted the story and it worked. Minor annoyance, but nothing new.
---
Two posts = spam? Sure jan.
---
That was the question, but Anet isn’t known for... consistency so... heh
---
Well, at least they are consistent in that all of the Norn that turn to Jormag are male.
---
No shame in playing a reaper mate, it takes up about 90% of my playtime these days :) I just have too much fun with it
---
The Sons of Svanir have always excluded females from their ranks. This isn't new or a some shot at men - it's just a tradition of the faction. Nothing more.
---
Raven's Wit😘
---
Makes 100% sense to me to be honest. Being known publicly on the internet sucks. Privacy should be cherished like this more in every day life. Gives you some space to actually live in!
---
Well...the delay took longer than the actual episodes worth of content...that was disappointing
---
The only downside is the loss of characters parked at quick dailies. Even before mounts, you could do the peach and unbound daily in Lake Doric under a minute for two quick chests with a parked mesmer.
---
Knowing anet they're probably more likely to disable utils and call it fixed.
---
Especially if you play as a Sylvari. "Hmm a weird voice in my head telling me to do things I normally wouldn't do. This seems AWFULLY FAMILIAR"
---
ASMR in the Dark, ye boi!
---
Is it showing up for anyone at the karma vendor? Because I can't find the node anywhere.
---
Can't get my friend into the game for exactly the same reason: too japanese.
---
If this is true,idk how Anet expects the game to stay "alive" , we have been already doing the same "latest" contents for months and months , and now they tell us we aren't getting anything until basically 2021 (or more) ? And yeah, i say anything because one Ls map every 2/3 months is totally not enough content , having even only a couple of fractals and a raid wing per year would be satisfying, but no,not even legendaries,like what will people throw golds in? We will have like 3k KPs from 100 CM, unlimited raid tokens,same fights forever...
---
Idk this might sound tragic and personal, but this is really really bad for the game, i wasn't expecting all this at all
---
So the usual.
---
But EAnet is just a SmAlL iNdIe CoMpAnY /s
---
Does this shock you though?
---
This, for real. It is literally a death sentence to the game
---
I live in Europe and its "normal" where I'm from.
---
I haven't logged in yet, but please tell me you're joking and the moro......i mean developers didn't try to stupidly pull a Game of Thrones and killed ALMORRA of all people.
---
I just thought it was dunny, after a year of playing I finally finished downloading all the game files, then once I re opened there was a new launcher and update
---
&gt; to which she answers she wasn't meant to take her place for many years.
---
I was wondering too, but she says "take the place as leader **of the fort**"
---
so maybe they mixed that a little bit up.
---
You don't have BLTC bound to a key?
---
&gt;I guess the point of her death is that Jormag needed to use her as a vessel to  lure us there using her voice?
---
Yeah, lure us with the voice of someone we know is dead. Not only does that sound extremely stupid, but it's been done before with Zhaitan trying to trick us into letting him kill us.
---
The helmet has an attached beard, even on Norn women lolol
---
Ah, I wasn't sure. Still crazy nice.
---
I think with this episode I don't need Jormag telling me to stop playing.
---
No, it's different, totally :(
---
Is that referencing something?
---
It's unsurprising.
---
Almorra didn't even get a line at the airship after Kralkatorrik, the thing she fought/drove her the entire time, died. Anet couldn't write a story to save their lives.
---
&gt;They are patchworking scraps of cancelled expansion
---
Sure hope not since this would mean even the full expansion would've been garbage.
---
I don't get it.
---
Oh I agree, Almorra's not worth the attention a good character like Tywin got
---
Small difference, gw2 is B2P poe is F2P. Make all past expansions free to everyone, and then we can talk about non stop gemstore bonanza, being ok.
---
I'm so mad about Almorra :/ Whoever wrote this, you did a really shit service to one of the most prominent characters of the franchise. I'm just.. So mad..
---
The longer you play the more weary your character becomes, gets slowing conditions, and only way to remove them is to take a break for at least 30 minutes xD
---
I said that to many people, last year, when they started to put festivals on automated systems and added 20 year achievement cap to them.
---
Seems like it. I think our only hope at this point is that people who have left and will leave ANet go on to make a "Guild Wars 3" game in all but name with a new world/IP.
---
