Thats such a bad joke it hurts :/.

same, I really want to play as one ( and not with a combat tonic anet, don't you dare )
---
you know that you can also buy the t-shirt from the vendor?
---
It is low because people gotta open the khan ur chest after all metas and i doubt most of people are doing that. Put that together with low tier chak egg odds, and you have the rarest item in the game

As a clarification of other comments: GW2 is a **skill** based game, not gear based. (The equipment cap hasn't been raised since Nov. 2012 and it is GW2 developer policy to never raise it again.) You do not grind Raids to get better gear so you can do better in Raids. You get better at Raids by learning the Raid and being a better player. Similar to Monster Hunter, hunts don't get easier by getting better gear. Hunts are easier when you learn how to hunt. GW2 is way easier than Monster Hunter. Player who are very experienced in WoW and  FF14 Raids say that GW2 Raids are extremely easy.

I think this is a great video guide for delivering information about setting up a spreadsheet but even though the information shown seems great, I have a hard time understanding it because the delivery could be better.
---
I already mentioned this feedback on one of your first videos and i will say it again.
---
Your delivery is way too fast. Keep in mind that many people of your potential target group are watching it in order to learn something, which means they are unfamiliar with the lesson you want to teach.
---
And in this case its not only the gw2 economy but also spreadsheets/apps.
---
You should still consider that at least half of your potential viewership doesnt have english as their first language and once you dive into lingo about specific or advanced intellectual topics, many of your viewers will be lacking the understanding of many words or terms because they dont even though them in their mother tongue.
---
I already suggested to make a subtitle by yourself but for this video, I just used the generic one provided by youtube and it actually was quite good, to be honest. It didnt get too much words you spoke wrong.
---
But still, you were talking so fast that even though I was able to read everything you said, I had a hard time computing it at the same time and nothing really sticked. Nevermind me not being able to pay attention to whatever the video showed while you were talking.
---
In general, even though its not my first language, I understand and speak english exceptionally well. I had 8 years of english lessons in school and worked in an international environment for over a decade where english was the working language, be it over in the states, england, during international projects on sailing ships and even founding for educational programs though the EU Commission.
---
But thew knowledge I am missing (in german or english) is spreads sheets and IT in general. I am no stranger to using MS office apps and I am not a computer illiterate but after watching your video twice, I still wouldnt be able to set up my own spreadsheet to be honest.
---
Thats it about your methodics about your lessons.
---
Regarding the content, I was wondering if you mostly use your own spreadsheets for your trading or if you still use other 3rd party apps on a daily basis for your trading.
---
Personally, my go to app for trading is gw2bltc because it offers the best graphs, sorting and filtering options with specific item based info or crafting costs just one click away.
---
The only app you mentioned was gw2spidy, which (besides gw2bltc and gw2tp) is probably one of the mostly used trading apps.
---
But it seems that you are only using gw2spidy for its API service, did I understand it right?
---
I only still use spidy for one feature: if you click on an item, it shows you which recipe including that item is currently the most profitable, which is a feature gw2bltc and gw2tp dont offer. Other than that, I fucking hate the illustration of the price/supply/demand graphs on spidy and gw2bltc delivers it so much better, apart from many other creat features.
---
The other 3rd party app I use on a daily basis is gw2efficiency of course but that is mostly for checking my trading post inbox and other stuff unrelated to trading. The trading post section on r/gw2efficiency just takes ages for me to load because my trading volume is so high and the filtering/sorting options in your trading history are awful as well.
---
Some general advice for posting in this subreddit:
---
In my opinion you are walking the line in breaking the subreddit rule of [advertising videos](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules#wiki_videos=).
---
So if you want to keep posting your guides here, I suggest you participate in some discussions outside your own topics.
---
I saw that you are also posting them on r/gw2economy and as a moderator of the subreddit I wont remove them. But you will probably catch more views here than there just because here is more traffic.
---
Nonetheless, I appreciate your effort and encourage you to go forward with your project, teaching other players about things you like and understand is always welcome.
---
Even though this video was the first one in your series that could potentially teach myself something as an experienced trader, as a content consumer, I would mostly be interested in watching livestreams (or recordings of it) from you showing your daily trading routine. I havent really noticed a twitch channel link of yours so I am not sure if you are doing that or not.
---
And as I mentioned before, consider making your API key public, even only for a limited time, so viewers can check your daily transactions and investments at their own pace. I think it will generate more viewers than theses guides on youtube.
---
Requirement for thousands of gold = more people buying gems or farming which keeps them playing or paying...
---
i thought it would mitigate a good portion of incoming damage \^\^ i mean you use heal if you get hit so this logic applies to all heal skills.
---
Dobby the house elf ?
---
The only ones it's truly penalising are the afk players, because their 8 pearls aren't enough anymore for infinite bonus loot. 
---
As for the active players, those boxes have simply become a pearl sink. Got all the rewards you desire but want to cash out those last few? Well now you can!
---
I mean, why does it even have a price tag to begin with, if it's supposed to be free additional loot?
---
Remember kids: You're not playing Blood Necro right unless you transfuse 5 allies straight into a bomb.
---
Just get Deathmagic and all the minions while leveling , easy mode .
---
I feel the same way about this, but I think the main issue stems from the new Khan-Ur helmets more than anything else. They're way too rare compared to the other items in the achievement given that they're only obtainable from map completion or the once a day meta. And even then its RNG to get it.
---
My only complaint about this patch is what feels to me an obscene rarity on some of the new items. The ebon shoulders seem alright, but the Charr specific helmet, the smoke shaman tonic and infusion all seem a little bit over the top silly to me. I love rare items and all but there are limits.
---
It also drops from map completion, but that doesn't seem to be making the problem any better. Either way, once more content this season starts coming out, its only going to get rarer still as people's attention goes elsewhere. This needs fixing by Anet.
---
I'm not 100% convinced he's going to be a full on villain for the whole story. Crecia is still unconvinced that he's all bad or that he isn't *trying* to do the right thing. There seem to be hints that something more is going on as well. If it feels a bit early to reveal the primary villain, maybe it is too early for him to be the main focus. Maybe he's being manipulated by Jormag or something?
---
I do like how the image of the Commander has changed through the story. Initially you're a fairly generic hero building up to killing Zhaitan with the Pact. After killing Zhaitan, and then Mordremoth, things start to sour, people no longer see the Commander necessarily as an all out hero. I think this is well presented in Joko's speech. Now with Kralkattorik dead and Aurene in his place, the Commander is a very divisive figure. Killing an elder dragon and then replacing him with one that favours you is an extremely powerful move. And considering that the rest of the world wasn't in the loop, it could very easily be seen as a threat. Consider that most of our big achievements so far have been destroying the biggest powers in the world. Since the Commander could now be considered the biggest power in the world (with Aurene) isn't it natural that other people now see us the same way we saw Zhaitan, Mordremoth, Joko, Balthazar, and Kralkatorrik?
---
either A. because people suck, B. Because he killed them with his weaver and cut off their epeen, or C. both A and B.
---
Maps are already calling it like that , gg awesome idea :).
---
Maybe they put this item in the super rare category by accident.
---
There is literally no supply after 4 days and you'll likely need 3 copies of it for the achievement.
---
Dan flat out said: 
---
"-The main reason he's been banned is for RMT and attempted RMT. We have banned people for even hinting that they would offer real money for gold, why should we make an exception for Cello?"  
---
The RMT and attempted RMT Dan is referring to here is the same as the guaranteed items that I spoke of earlier.
---
Those other things he's listed are other things that were points of discussion but they have nothing to do with the rules listed on gw2exchange.
---
Tyty for the concise response I am really interested to see how this matter goes down and we should keep updates on it. Also why did they downvote you when you explained the BL skins etc. a bit confused
---
Are the ebon shoulders not the same rarity and same methods of acquisition? Please let me know other methods cuz I’m dying to get it!!
---
It costs 5 times as much as the carnival weapon achievement, tho.
---
Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't see the rule that said we can't talk about new content....Perhaps you could point it out to me?  I'd like to follow the rules of this subreddit, but I'm afraid I haven't been able to find the one that disallows talk about new content for a period of time after it's released.  It would be kind of a silly rule, but surely it must exist, otherwise you'd just be acting like an asshole by making the comment you did...
---
I figured, but I put that part in as a hedge in case I was wrong :)
---
The carnival weapon achievement is set in stone, though.  It's money you give to NPC vendors.
---
This one is set by player demand on the Trading Post.  The content is new, so yes, it's very expensive to buy the items.  That won't hold up forever, eventually the prices will come down as more items enter the economy.
---
Its better than to much supply that kill the prestige of a Rare skin. Just check Dhuum chair and Quadim2.0 infusion. The price lower and stabilise, so just wait for it.
---
&gt;You guys are fuckin *nailing* it.
---
This. I was 100% satisfied with the story in this episode..
---
you understood wrong, he was never banned from the game*, ANET informed him that he would be, if he didnt remove the guranteed patreon rewards (because thats literally money exchange for an ingame item) which he removed, ANET never cared about gambling, the only thing that anet cares about is, weather what he is doing is considered RMT or not. the Gambling discussion is only between him and the website "Patreon", because it's not allowed on there to have raffles between subscribers. 
---
the BAN you read about refered to another subreddit, which has other moderators than GW2 who considered what he did RMT and therefore banned him from the subreddit /r/gw2exchange, that page has no affiliations with any GW2 employee, same as this subreddit.
---
At first glance I legit thought this was an npc spawn I’ve never seen before, awesome job on this look I love it
---
Wth is Spotify? I only use Tidal.
---
If anything happened to him I would be pissed that I didn't get to do it myself.
---
[deleted]
---
Sorry what?
---
&gt; I have a couple of hundred. It might be unmanageable.
---
This is why a "Friends" chat would be amazing. Just drop a message saying "Hey, I'm doing X" and everyone whose a mutual might see the message and reply for an invite.
---
Additional thoughts:
---
1. You can turn it off, so gripes about spam are irrelevant.
---
2. It'd be a default feature, which gives it superior presence compared to a personal guild, private discord, or whatever else other people think is a good solution.
---
3. Fits right into existing chat system.
---
Agreed, I want him to be the primary villain for the saga and I look forward to the catharsis of killing him at the end.
---
I love these solo runs. Reminds me of Mage Tower in WoW Legion. I want to see some more challenging solo content, TBH.
---
How about just a "Friends" chat?
---
MapleStory and Runescape have it and it works amazingly for filling in the social gaps guilds and private skype/messenger/discord groups cannot.
---
yeah, Canach rules.
---
What's the song?
---
Just a clarification: The actual community IN-GAME is positive, friendly and helpful.
---
The toxicity and whining is almost entirely here, on the forums, Twitch, YouTube, etc.

A lot of jumping puzzle type chests have cool downs that are both reset and independent to reset. For example, most jumping puzzles, you can't do before reset and after reset on the same day. The cooldown is something like six hours.
---
Send in a ticket for sure on this, but I suspect this must have a cooldown too. If it does have that cool down it shouldn't eat your coins though.
---
Honestly the wildflowers and general scenery are beautiful. Love the crystals too but it was nice seeing some real diversity to the area now that the brands being purified.
---
Ohhhhhhhh. Official stickers. Me like 😜
---
huh, interesting. I managed to get it figured it out, but I dunno if it's because I waited out the ICD for it, or if it's because I swapped maps.
---
I was thinking Choya but Zojja works.
---
to summarise it: worth it
---
Different kinds of beauty to be sure. Natural Beauty vs Mystical Beauty. Both still gorgeous! This is map is truly stunning... ^(if not for the ugly charr architecture :))
---
Two people on gw2efficiency have one of these skins unlocked right now. Have fun waiting for a price drop with this drop rate.
---
Goremonger would be so proud of you!! 💖
---
Said in other post heal. But flock runes are pretty much how.
---
Griffon was the first thing I went for as lvl 80, directly after that skyscale. didn’t took me long and was much fun. I did it together with a friend who was also new to gw.
---
Gonna be honest I was really bummed when they announced Charr/Norn lands over Cantha but after seeing how pretty Grothmar is in GW2 I'm all for it
---
Okay but like, we don't know exactly where they'll go from there. He sees a wild card (us) with an Elder Dragon backing them up.  So he decides to go level the playing field by overpowering another Elder Dragon with a weapon he knows is able to damage it.
---
He's not running in a blind rage to kill it like Balthazar. He's honestly doing exactly what America and the Soviet Union did in the Cold War: *they have a big gun, so let's make one of our own. Just to be safe.*
---
What if he runs off and Jormag does end up corrupting everyone around him, and he's just barely able to snap out of the almost-hypnotic allure long enough to escape? Then suddenly he's resentful and might be a hesitant ally as he joins our war because the charr are one of the first targets Jormag will go after.
---
So even though he becomes an ally, he'll still be around to tell us when we're being naive or arrogant. He'll still be able to challenge our worldview and make us feel like it's been nothing but goddamn luck keeping us from destroying everything. He can be the one to infuse some charr wisdom on us: we need to learn to face the consequences of our actions, not just fix them with more reckless abandon.
---
If they go anywhere in that general direction, I'll be super stoked. He can be an antagonist on some level without being a villain. And one with a serious bone to pick.
---
I'll never be able to unsee the weird baby arms she had after her ascension
---
Rule #5 You are allowed to use gliding and mounts.
---
What about for additional characters? Only the first character can do the collection. The rest have to level on discovery.
---
It's kind of vague the way they presented it. It emphasized the need to keep Kryta's secrets but it also tended to phrase it as "never betray Kryta" which could be interpreted as "never fail to serve Kryta when it calls." Obviously this would be really strange for non-human Commanders, especially charr.
---
I don't know what the correct interpretation is but I know the whole thing stirred up a ton of (well-deserved) criticism. The fact that we still don't know the actual implications and details of a life-and-death oath is kind of problematic.
---
He will try to have Jormag as his weapon, but Jormag will make him and his fellows to her Icebrood and try to conquer everything.
---
*"Only Raids are true content!"*
---
*"Only WvW is true content!"*
---
*"Only PvP is true content!"*
---
There's a group of people who are convinced he should be permanently banned from everything for TOS violations. They're pretty fired up about it.
---
You were clumsy while taking them out and dropped them on the floor. :p
---
And what value do those pearls have once you get all the rewards?
---
I can’t do this daily sadly cus I don’t have a pepper to pick
---
In the old times at least leeching was a crime.
---
Dhuum would come out and slice these plebs.
---
Now, casual plebs kill Dhuum.
---
Undocumented lol
---
Nah, but they would still be rich if they did. What i am saying is that these streamers that give away so much stuff just are that rich. And now they use that to Gain followers and patrons. Does not have to be a scam
---
I'll wait, thank you. I like a challenge.
---
Would probably offend people.
---
I do miss the necromancer casting animations from GW 1. Teenage me loved them and adult me still does.
---
Only real way to do that would be to make their base states near useless then have them scale with traits and stats almost entirely.
---
It doesn't really originate from there. Headbanging has been a thing since who knows how long. 
---
Hell, I could post a side by side comparison of the GW 2 emote and a clip from fucking Metalocalypse.
---
Not ingame right now but doesnt it say something about giving Karma on repeat once you e unlocked the end chest once ?
---
I’m sure there are more offensive things in GW2 than \m/
---
Oh well. :&lt;
---
Also, Anet might decide to put a "funny" daily cap on it, so use those sickle boys
---
Yeah you can prob solo all non fract/raid conent.
---
We will probably need all LS4 currencies + Hatched Chillies, for whatever may come in the future, but I don't think developers have the balls to go back to the LS4 maps and make us farm all the currencies again
---
Yes, except some bosses, dungeons/fractals and meta events, all is soloable, specially all the personal story (base and expansions)
---
Even Fractal/Raid content too lol
---
Who said that you ever get "all the rewards"? Orrian Pearls are one of the easiest ways to get ascended backpacks and amulets. After the stat update for selectable gear the value is even higher. They are the best source to get unbound magic, right after Winterberries.
---
And to answer your question precisely:
---
If you convert unbound magic to gold, one Orrian Pearl is worth 5-7s. That's ~50s for 8 coffers. 
---
That means every 2 meta events you lose 1g now, compared to before the nerf. That's literally 1g less per hour. With a rate of ~13g/hour, 1g/h less means 7,5% loss. And *that* means the gold/h rate drops below Silverwastes (without low lvl char).
---
Yes and even the group events/instances don't require much actual interaction with other humans so you should be fine as long as you carry your weight
---
If you want to go that far yeah, but generally you'd still need to be in a group.
---
Dude, it's the internet. There are a lot of things that are actually offensive on here and yet people only seem to whine and bitch about the most mundane things.
---
Alas, you cannot eat the Chilis...
---
Bangarr is the best villain Guild Wars 2 has had, and if GW2 keeps going in this direction with its story, you bet your ass I'll be back to head-over-heels in love with this game.
---
This is awesome!!
---
But if you, a non charr, recover it it's not really true to the name is it?
---
I have a feeling the mask will unlock all 3 at once unless they really did make a mistake on the drop rate.
---
Shhhh....they might fix it.
---
He probably should be reported to Patreon in that case, because they do not allow raffles, even if they were free. If you have to pay to enter then it's 100% gambling.
---
 Correct, if they don't hit minimum wage the employer is supposed to fill in the leftover. But minimum really isn't sufficient compensation for the jobs and hours they tend to work.
---
OP's bit unrelated?
---
Except it's not tarrific o.o
---
Now we just need a "Cavitation" skill that does the same as Stomp, but Underwater, same changes for Rampage.
---
Then we can move to [the rest of the list](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/File:Not_available_underwater.png)!
---
What baby arm? Will I regret this?
---
Cool, thanks!  I really hope it's cause I currently suck (something I can fix with practice) and not cause the class got nerfed horribly (something I can't fix) lol.
---
&gt; Most people won't ever finish it, so including it as part of the episode is pointless.
---
What kind of logic is this? Is *everything* that is included in the main episode tab somehow obligated to be finished by an average player? You don't need this one to finish meta-achievement and get an emote, and as you said, they even provided the reward (t-shirt) separately. All that is left is your OCD and 2-3 AP.
---
The short version is that Core Ele got nerfed a bit to give a little more power directly to Tempest and Weaver. Tradeoffs and all that. If you are struggling with survival try switching some Zerker gear for Soldier.
---
Edit: spelling
---
&gt; Please point me to where I said I don't tip, you seem to think just because I don't support shaming people who can't tip, that I myself do not support tipping when you can.
---
People who cannot afford to tip should be shamed, because they should not have gone to a sit-down restaurant. Eating without tipping is no different than eating and then running out on the bill. If your entree costs $20, and you aren't willing *and* able to pay at least $24 for it, then you should not order it in the first place. 
---
There's no shame in being poor, there is shame in harming others for it.
---
I had, usually is not an issue on your side. I had to create a support ticket for it, then it was fixed
---
Yeah no, you're stretching here. The same as skipping out on the bill? Come off it. Shaming those who you know nothing about because they can't tip is child like behavior, end of story. But whatever, shame people for your own preconceived notions, you do you.
---
Reading as much as I could of the post on patreon. It says they just get it. So it is more so RMT in a way.
---
Good job missing my entire point. I don't really get why not jumping on the shame bandwagon is so difficult for some people here. You do you though.
---
If something can't be completed by the vast majority of the player base (As of right now, and yes, I know, no one's completed it on gw2effiency) then yes, including it is pointless.
---
Staff staff when I want to be cautious/self reliant. And axe torch/pistol for group stuff or just when I want to do faster damage. Full viper for both and both infinite horizon build.
---
You can't finish the collection doing the pvp or wvw track.
---
This is the first Charr-exclusive headgear since launch and they *had* to lock it behind a very very low drop rate :(
---
&gt; Especially with the strike mission being so...unchallenging it just feels like very boring daily grind. 
---
They did say that the strike boss will evolve and get harder over time. I assume the loot table will remain the same and just expand. But still, I also find it way too low for that type of content.
---
Got it. I discovered how that works.
---
so after you throw your own torch, if you stand near other ppl and anyone throw their torch too, then the game will think you receive other ppl fire and give you the buff, even though you're not holding a torch anymore. Hence the bug and you have to wait for it to time out.
---
The way I found that works is to stand in the back. Stay where there' s nobody. Pick a torch, light it up, throw on the path, while not touching anyone.
---
Awesome. This is why we can't have nice things in this game.
---
How to delete someone else's topic? ^^/s
---
If youre talking about the tshirt, yes both track rewards them.
---
You dont bring scourge on SH because of torment. You bring it solely for the epi. Mirage destroys scourge on SH
---
&gt;For a t-shirt you can get for free from the wvw or pvp track, or buy for 5 gold after you finish the master of ceremonies achievement, and 5 ap
---
....
---
Yes, there's nothing nice in the game.
---
They have different names which usually means they don't unlock together x.x
---
unberwaber dagon comfirbed
---
People regard him as complex because he made his true nature so hard to puzzle out. But after the fact, we should all know he was just a guy with power who lived long enough to make sure he had all the cards. Mystery and awe were tools he used to his advantage, and for a while players were also caught up in that web until we got the full story.
---
It's exactly as you said. Compelling, but not particularly complex.
---
Please do this
---
I find your logic problematic in soooo many ways...
---
Like why do you still play and come to forums to complain about a game you play that has POINTLESS content? Go play something you think has a point to play and please leave us here to spend our time and gold in this pointless game. Thank you :)
---
^ that! Couldn't said it better myself :)
---
This petition is more important than any White House bill
---
Suggesting soldier gear in pve? That's cruel...
---
This works/worked for the ap to loot 200 peppers as well. I withdrew a bunch from my bank looking to find out if i could eat them for VM and got the ap completed that way.
---
Some dungeon require teamwork at certain points (like CoF p1 braziers), but that's about it.
---
Oh and there's that one event in Vabbi, which requires 3 players to begin.
---
your first link is no bueno
---
I complained about one aspect of the game.  I envy you, to be playing a game that you obviously consider perfect.  you must play it in a non-stop state of bliss.  Meanwhile, I've spent 20k hours playing a game I so obviously hate that I found a flaw in it.  I can only hope I find a game I find flawless.  I'm happy that you've found your's.
---
Is it really so bad to go back and play old maps? Whenever they do this, I really enjoy the incentive to go back and play maps that I’ve stopped playing as much. It has the side benefit of repopulating the old maps and making them fun to play again.
---
Thanks a lot for the kind words! I actually don't take much photos irl, but do often take screenshots when playing (first-person) walking sim games. Just too many wallpaper-y scenes!
---
&gt;The carnival weapon achievement
---
Not really on topic, but i have a question.. I can't seem to find that collection you're talking about (The carnival weapon achievement ), not even on the wiki, so i was wondering if that's actually a collection achievement. I like ap hunt so i was hoping you can clarify this information for me :D. Thank you!!
---
There is a small point. When playing daredevil, the only way to find out what dodge you have (aside from going to your traits) is to dodge. 
---
There is a point, but it doesn’t matter.
---
No no. Dwarves became *more solid* not less in GW2.
---
I love engineer, but they've always been given a pretty rough hand.
---
&gt; I'll wait, thank you. I like a challenge
---
As long as you don't run around and create topics saying "HOW COULD U ANET?!" like everyone does. People act as if its the end of the world when something comes out that requires them to play LS maps for currency.
---
That is incredibly lucky, because in half that time I’ve gotten just one from WvW and one from TT.
---
S3: needs a shitton of stuff at the end of the season.
---
everyone: :o
---
S4: needs a metric fuckton of stuff at the end of the season:
---
S5: is going to need ludicrous amounts of suff
---
everyone, once again: :o
---
It's like charged quartz. That stuff is in every major recipe, and yet people are surprised time and time again to see it being needed. Kind of like winter. My company is surprised by it every year. Such an unforseeable event.
---
"Grinding isn't content!"
---
If I understand it correctly they mean that new gemstore items will get announced on twitter while the ERP wasn't and gemstore will always be in the patchnotes but not all changes to the game.
---
While I can understand the sentiment it is also not that easy. They clearly underestimate how long such patchnotes will get when they add every change they made to the game for that patch. Sometimes things are being changed to address upcoming stuff and many times there are things changed on the one side that have an effect on unrelated things.
---
Toxic ''veterans''*
---
I know this is a bit contrary to your point of view in the post, but I personally like the existence of very low drop rate skins in the world. Of course if you’re a hard core completionist it can be frustrating, but it is still nice to have some very rare skins drop out in the open world as opposed to being sold in the cash shop.
---
&gt; what feels to me an obscene rarity on some of the new items
---
This applies to a ton of items. The game is about fashion and locking some of the best items/infusions behind insane rng is not how it should be handled. 
---
The name of the game is to look nice and flashy. When players can't even do that what will happen? They will trash the game and move on from it. Stuff can be rare but not stupid levels of rare. They need to create account bound versions of the super rare stuff but increase the drop rate of them. The only players who win are the TP barons who control/manipulate all of those items.
---
You haven't missed much, we went à while without an update. The prologue of season five just came out a few days ago, so people will be playing the new map, but that's it.
---
Sorry I can't help with the high-end PVE stuff. I don't thiiiink that there was much (or any) balancing done, so if your build was viable six months ago, it should still be now. But I could be wrong. I mostly stick to killing things in the open world.
---
Well since you said you already gave up on GW2 , I think you should go back to whatever else you're playing good luck .
---
[removed]
---
Even wvw and strikes can be done alone.
---
Holo hasn't.
---
You can skip the braziers with certain classes
---
Condition damage: Staff is great as it does a bit of everything. Axe (mostly just auto-attack as it's a liability in difficult terrain) or sceptre (better range and a block) main, torch or pistol offhand. Take the traits that sync up with the weapon choices. 
---
Power: Greatsword is good generally, but the multi-beam ambush attack is great for farming. Sword is good but clunky. Offhand, focus and sword are both solid choices. 
---
Personally, I use greatsword for big meta events with lots of mobs because it really goes increase the amount of loot you get. The rest of the time, I like staff as my condi weapon of choice. Axe's mobility is... wonky. Axe 2 *will* at some stage send you over a cliff and I have teleported myself into scenery and under the map with axe 3. I don't really enjoy sceptre, but it's good at what it does. 
---
Torch is good because you basically always have burning damage on the go. Pistol is good for medium-range and the 5 attack does good breakbar damage. Pistol is also good for PvP because of the stun.
---
I played f2p for almost a year when I started out :) It's totally doable, you can try out all the classes (except revenant) and level up 2 characters to 80 (max level). There is plenty of exploring and you can do PvP, WvW (after level 60 if I remember well) and start doing fractals as well. So try it and if you like the game you can buy the expansions after.
---
Precast a clone from another weapon and swap weapon during cast, that way you keep the burst that you would have + you can take a different skill. Think defender would be better over mimic tho..
---
Is that edited or are you using reshade? Because if it is the latter i'd really like to get my hands on your settings :D
---
prologue map for the new living world is out. not too bad of a map.  
---
boon chrono is still good but firebrigade is really good atm as well just not as common. other than that raid comp is pretty much the same.
---
Yeah you take improv off, misclicked in build editor, thanks for reminding :)
---
marauder is better
---
That sounds like a fix to me?
---
Yes, i just enjoy the world and story, just pve content, no pressing for meta. Doing events, puzzles, world bosses etc
---
Didnt this change come with the change to the underwater fractal? Ever since I noticed the change as well. But idk if they mentioned something about the use of extra underwater skills.
---
u/imguralbumbot
---
There is a tradeable version of the home instance node available on the TP for less than 50g and dropping.
---
If you buy it now, and the Icebrood Saga lasts a year, and then they release some big item that needs Hatched Chilis, *and* it only gives you 1 per day, that's still 365 chilis you don't have to go farm. Less than 14 silver per chili.
---
Xddd
---
Well, true, but they weren't 1500 gold each, either.
---
With the basic guide above I did it on my first playthrough with no video to watch or anything. Very easyu to do.
---
Because they use tactics like this so you make money for yourself but even more for them? Don't get me wrong it's a smart move on their wnd. I'd just not do it myself. And it boils down to waisting 60ish hours just to have a rich guy sit on his arse and make more money for doing nothing.
---
I read this through the first time thinking the asura's nose was it's mouth, just blissfully smiling throughout
---
Cursed image... That and dee-dee...
---
Whether or not a game is immersive is completely irrelevant to whether or not a game is a good open world game. Minecraft is not exactly immersive, yet it's a good open world game. Myst, Riven, Obduction, the Bioshock series or the Halo series for example, are very immersive yet none of them are open world games. A game being immersive doesn't automatically make it a good open world game and vice versa. So your point is moot.
---
you dunno? the deal is, go buy gems, convert into gold and buy from tp ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
i found skyrim to be superior in both those things too. gw2 has a lot of variety but it's all shallow. the expression "wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle" comes to mind, i prefer quality over quantity.
---
it's anets way of saying fuck you to all players, we don't give a shit anymore just buy gems or fuck off.
---
Dude, the kindergarten-speak was the best part wtf.
---
Except they don't. All the racial dances are well made and look clearly better than the profession dances in GW1. You are delusional and high on nostalgia if you think otherwise. Only thing that you could see as a positive in GW1's dances is them being more extravagant, which on one hand could give them more memetic potential but on other they feel more out of place.
---
Do you use gw2hook+reshades? what presets u use? Nice Shots! Share please the settings. Thank you
---
Are you the thread?
---
I optimistically checked my chrono's wells... still no underwater use.
---
What chore? If you have a reasonably full home instance you are getting a good amount of materials for about 5 minutes. It also becomes even more important if you are making ascended food.
---
I wonder how many players sold it for 5 silvers?
---
Before buffing hammer, someone should remember Anet that rifle actually is a thing for Warrior... Last "Buff" was a year ago. Burst and some otheres where updated 2015/16 for the last time. Rifle has literally no synergy with one of the traitlines, it damage sucks and so on.  
---
And to be honest from a "normal" (which means not balancing) standpoint: GW2 rifles all look like front loaders but they fire full automatic with no reloads at all. So why the hell should anyone use axes, swords or bows when there are magic muskets that work fully automatic and without reloading?   
---
And just for WvW, there would be nothing cooler than rows of warrior musketeers who face each other in order and shoot each other. :O
---
So please give Rifle a little love. Or delete it completely. As it is now, it is a shame.
---
Or am I a spoon who don't remember how to get them?
---
You can't craft it as a weaponsmith.
---
400 Jewelry crafting is the only way to make platinum ingots iirc.
---
hope we will find out in next episode yea
---
hahaha thats awesome !
---
Weaponsmiths unable to craft platinum ingots. You need another profession (or buy them).
---
Yes, it is quite stupid.

this is a comment about how this post is biased and should not be on my 40 year old boomer reddit
---
this is a reply to the comment detailing how this boy has mental issues and should not be allowed to post on my 40 year old boomer reddit
---
BTW you can use TRV on cHolo. We discussed about that on SC discord after the changes. The damage difference is not that high. But you will need to manage heat while playing piano. And most Sc'ers (is this a word?) hate mechanics on dodge and avoid them unless they're bound to a class mechanic. And to be honest: Managing Heat, managing dodges and playing pioano as a "Rotation" is a nightmare. So the downsides (manage dodges and heat) isn't worth the comparable DPS when you just can explode for the same dps without managing anything besides the rota.
---
Dont like the elegy shoulders, they seem to behave differently with light than the rest of the armor, also the spikes dont fit. Other than that, as long as you dont hide the face under the holographic helmet, he looks alright..

Yeah and it is going down more for each day i guess i should stop watching it on the trading post it just makes me mad :/

Yea I mean that's fine, if a Patreon raffle is allowed, then a Paypal raffle should be allowed too right? I don't wanna break patreon's terms of service so I rather do it via Paypal, shouldn't be a problem right?
---
Oh you're right. Some look like shotguns. :D But my standpoint is still valid. Magical rifle with an endless amount of bullets &gt; every other weapon. :'D
---
Nah. I don't see the value. If you really are friends with someone, you might just as well communicate your intentions.
---
This is a comment detailing how your post violates rules of this sub and thus you should be banned from it.
---
I'd recommend a tempest auramancer for HoT, it's as tanky as you can get while still doing good damage and the utility shouts are a lifesaver - magnetic aura especially as it reflects projectiles, of which there are *plenty* in HoT. 
---
There's also nothing wrong with using Marauder gear instead of Berserker while you get used to the game again, it gives you more HP without losing too much DPS.
---
&gt;It says they just get it.
---
what does this expression mean? sry my english isn't good, what does who just get?
---
You are definitely in a minority ... for sure. I am usally letting roughly 10-12 ppl into my full home on a daily basis and from my experience less than 1% will tip. I usally don't care because I have my nodes for so long that I am litterally printing money with them daily but there are not many of those "good" ppl out there.
---
In the early days - as full homes came at a cost of thousands of gold - ppl tipped with one of the harvested goods but even that is not common anymore.
---
no, because Dragonhunter still can't use traps underwater...
---
best option i had sadly  and i think the spikes match ok with the legs(belt) they have the same kind  of material. ty for feedback
---
BOOMER LOCATED LMAO LOOK AT HIS POST HISTORY WHAT A SAD DUDE LMAO
---
Wanted to try it with Galaxy 2.0 which also accept animated poster, but the file size limit is 2MB.
---
Do you know of a way to compress that file down? File is too big for Online image compressor and won't be accepted.
---
While I don't think that's true. It's still just a shitty move
---
it is a thing since the implementation of the first home nodes... was a long time a grey-ish area and got a clarification via a froum post about five years ago. Selling things that don't requiere group gameplay to finish is missuse of the lfg system. That is why most home node lfg messages changed from "full home for xx silver" to "full home, donations are welcome".
---
I dont think they are that "rare", they are rare, but not as rare as many claim it to be. The problem is that not enough people bother to farm the meta events for the keys to open the chest daily and many dont even know about it yet, paired with people insta buying it on the TP makes it look like its incredible rare and drops only once a bloodmoon.
---
They aren't
---
Guess I forgot the /s. Absolutely possible that I don't check underwater stuff for months.
---
*"let's take this thinly spread butter, and spread it even thinner"*
---
I know you like to suggest this a lot, but I really hope nobody every implements this suggestion.
---
Forsaken Fortune dungeon comes up in rotation for Dailies so on those days it's easy to get
---
/rockout has a horrible loop
---
How would you feel if they advertised its existence here at first and moved it to a different category later?
---
It is a learning curve. You did not only went from core game to HoT you went from a loooong time away from the game which means you are pretty much new to it but easier to get back too since you at one point understood ele and there for can adapt faster. 
---
But this is a good thing. You will learn fast and when you understand how the mobs works and what you need to do to survive and maybe add some marauder trinkets (eles new best friend when learning or play WvW and still krank out tons of damage with it) it will become pretty easy for you again. 
---
Some mobs can really destroy you in HoT and PoF when being squishy so stopping them and then kill them is of importance. 
---
In open world i would use Tempest Scepter/Warhorn or i guess Dagger/Warhorn also works, but scepter still give you range. Staff on meta events always nice. In story instances what ever works for you.
---
Tempest have tons of defense in their overload and their auras the shouts and the cc it can offer. So open world and story are really great with Tempest and you can make it as squishy or defensive as you like or need.
---
I have a few at draconis mons JP, a few at Skipping stones JP, and a few at the Goonies pirate ship one (sorry can’t remember). Southsun Cove and the Goonies one have decent map event rewards. Don’t forget to pick up the guild potion from the guild hall that is faster map reward track progression.
---
It's better that wat.
---
i think i missed the ice cream truck
---
I parked 25 chars at the draconis mons JP and 25 at the sirens landing JP. you get salvageable items at the sirens JP that can give you any tier of wood/ore/leather/cloth. so thats a pretty neat way to get a good amount of different tier mats.
---
Flame Legion tricked you!
---
It is strange though because the boss in the wintersday festival have this, so the tech is there, and i dont get why they did not make it like that.
---
I'm fairly sure the VIP Pass only gets you a title. To get the discount on the weps you have to pay karma to get Circus Vouchers (10 days of doing the heart per weapon, 1.68 mil karma total for the set).
---
Most dungeons are soloable, unless they have mechanics that forces you to have more players. Same is true for fractals. Some Metas are also doable solo, but as you don't have to interact with others in a meta event I don't think its important. ;) Even the new strike mission is easy soloable (atm at least). Just Raids and CM aren't soloable. Ok. If you're good anough MAMA and  Skorvald can be done solo, but I don't think that's fun. ;)
---
Yeah, because we all know how much people loved the new WvW maps released, right?
---
I discarded hammer on my guardian because 1c takes forever
---
If it can drop doubloons, then yes, it is better, due to 100% chance for at least 1 rare and a hundred unbound magic~.
---
I can't agree more with you
---
Yo fam
---
love the amount of char slots you got! I'm a noob at making gold but how does parking your char at certain places help? I mean like JP rewards are not worth so much right. i understand your multiplying by 70x or something but is it significant ?
---
Sorry I'm a noob but have you tried TP flipping?
---
I will try this out and get back to you guys on this. Thanks for the help!
---
Yeah, I'm shocked that they haven't done anything to Antitoxin uber-cleanse Scrapper yet
---
Whoops, sorry, no disservice to the devs intended.
---
You may have noted that I'm the more casual sort of player. I didn't mention the raid, or the cooking update, or the legendary runes and sigils because I'm barely aware that these are timings that happened. Goes above my head.
---
I'm not usually the sort to complain about what the devs do, I think they're doing a pretty fabulous job. What I meant was that there's only been one *story* update since OP stopped playing and its' pretty recent, so there's not too much to cqtch up on in that area. I don't know why I fixated on the story parts - either because OP mentioned getting the skyscale as the last point of reference, or because story stuff is what I personally enjoy the most.
---
Not that the whole festivals, crafting, raid etc wasn't good. It's great this stuff happened. It doesn't do much for me, personally, but it's good that there's something for everyone in what the devs are doing.
---
I don't see any problem to actually have rare achievements....you know....that you have to achieve.
---
It's still a solo task, just like a good part of open world. You can communicate with others, but you dont need to.
---
Don't farm. Just visit the map like once every week for few events and you will have supply big enough.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d1us27/gold_per_hour_open_world_map_benchmarks/
---
this?
---
The main problem with signet of vampirism is that it heals for a very small amount and only triggers once per second. Healing is only 325 + (.1 * your healing power). So, even if you have 1600 healing (you probably don't), it's only going to heal you for 485. That's better than nothing, but there are plenty of much better uses for that skill slot.
---
Also, /u/Evochron13 is correct about taking Flesh Golem as your Elite skill. It does a very good job of following your active target, it's 90% immune to AoE damage (all pets/summons are), and the Charge skill allows you to send it in as a tank from 1200 range without needing to actually attack the target. Charge also does a decent amount of breakbar damage.
---
Yea, I was furiously shooting at every target unable to get that 25th. Then I said to myself that there are only two options. 1)  RNGesus has forsaken me 2) There is target that I just haven't spotted yet. So I took little calm ride on a platform, observing the area and then: "Is that bump on that window a target?" I shot it and 25/25 dinged. At that moment I was sure, that more people has to have the same problem, so I made this post.
---
They've discussed changing that [here](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/87353/future-potential-wvw-centric-balance-changes-september-13th-2019):
---
&gt;Superior Rune of Antitoxin: Change it so that instead of increasing outgoing condition cleanses by one it instead increases incoming condition cleanses by one, thus only affecting the wielder, but allowing it to scale up with external cleanses.
---
I think it's cool that this node can also be a drop.  But is there any value to these chilles?  
---
The food recipe (expertise/concentration) that uses them, does it have a value to a specific profession or content?
---
Aside from buying unique skins, what else are they for? I haven't seen any ascended accessories available for sale, nor can the currency (currently) be consumed for VM.
---
This is what has stopped me from buying one off the TP: I don't yet see a point.
---
Yes, its intresting that there are many path combinations. I had fun doing this challenge.
---
The plan was to have maximum character slots just for the fun of it. I suppose when you have too much cash to blow it becomes a thing
---
Then I'd have to buy it, heh.
---
well anet stated that you have to play all your accounts actively. and hes obviously not doing it
---
The Skyscale collection LITERALLY made me eat my own cat because I was running out of food thanks to ARENANET making me play so much!!! &gt;:(
---
Dont send Multiple Tickets. Stay calm and wait.
---
Hello everybody,
---
I've just updated the Historical Guide, new in this release:
---
- Grothmar Valley
---
- Full zone outlines for the bonus mission packs "the Flight North" and "the Rise of the White Mantle"
---
- All polymock arenas
---
- Fronis Irontoe's Lair 
---
- The main Charr camp in Grothmar, now occupied by Metal Legion
---
Enjoy!
---
I was able to get rid of it by also waypointing to another map and then back
---
Starting with subject 6 is not the norm.
---
Usually you do south room with the switches first. But this room only requires 2 people to complete. So, during the south room, someone can solo heat room. On top of that, someone can solo the dormitory. The last person can help out with south, help with dormitory, or start the rp for subject 6.
---
With pugs, you might not always have someone able to solo heat, but usually people beeline for south. So if you’re a dps, I would highly recommend doing dormitory while your group does south.
---
I think they just didn't know what they were doing with many of the rewards, someone made A expensive, but then someone else made A drop like candy.
---
It's not just the shirt, the home instance node is pretty distasteful as well.
---
they processing more tickets now cuz of the hot being free with pof and doing refunds, my ticket got answered after 9 days
---
More likely, people won't give a damn. Both extremes are bad and discourage players from being completionists.
---
You really shouldn’t have to do that.
---
ArenaNet hates money. They could literally sell new playable races for 10€ each (no gems, only real money) and cash in like crazy.
---
But yeah, still no swim suits either. Sigh.
---
Best to just drop a portal at the furthest one.
---
Its being updated
---
It's really interesting to see what kind of trees the area actually has in the original. Kinda sad to see that they ditched the work of recreating them.
---
I agree.  Unlike S4 chapter 1, this Prologue has me very excited for the next chapter, S5 Chapter 1.  
---
I also really enjoy how it tied into all the nuggets and teasers they have marketed over the past months.
---
We all knew we were heading after Jormag, but the spin this prologue added to that plot makes it way more exciting.
---
You're not the only one. I bought it too on the first day.
---
I thought that whole arc was hilarious
---
Do you had a F2P account before? If yes, it takes up to 5 days remove the restrictions. You should get an ingame mail with the exact time it takes.
---
The rangers think that Snakes can't swim
---
Yeah thats the unrestricted category though. this one is restricted.. purchasing hero points to get to the elite specs is what pushed that into Unrestricted. - which i might make attempts on as well :D
---

Thank you so much!

Yah , i had if its matter of waiting then its ok , i thought the payment bugged or something , tysm for ur fast respond and help guys .
---
Looking forward into joining u all ingame
---
Made a simple cover out of the Grothmar Valley magazine so it looks nice within your music collection. [https://imgur.com/a/uw9AQbr](https://imgur.com/a/uw9AQbr)
---
I see you have slotted Impact sigils but with no break bar surely force/night would be better there? Good job on the kill!
---
There's no meta for open world. As long as you can carry your weight in group content (aka provide relevant boons+heals or have good enough dps) you'd be fine. I'd just avoid groups that ask for specific builds.
---
Actually that isn't a fair call , because you aren't considering the fact that in GW1 ALL of the characters had nearly the same mesh and rigging when it comes to animation this cuts down a huge amount of work , whereas in GW2 that isn't the case particularly with regard to the Char and the Asura (the other races are fairly similar on the mesh and rigging ) Granted I would like to see more emotes available but I am fully aware of the difficulties of applying them to multiple meshes and rigging systems for animations, because with some of them you have to totally rework the animation.
---
HoT is better when not broken by mounts
---
rock on! that is awesome! thank you!
---
The best content is the stuff that forces you to leave the game /s
---
Oh wow, I didn't realize that had happened. Okay, now things make more sense.
---
Come to raising skyscale and notice that the event for the whistle is bugged since forever. That will give u a break :)
---
Haha, good to know.
---
Relogging can put you on a different map though, and for some of us, it takes a long time to load in. This is a bug, we shouldn't need to find ways around it.
---
First if you want an idea of how much there is to do, just open your acheivment's tab. This is the real completionist end game. You probably are at,0. 004% completion ^^.
---
In general the game is quite easy, in 90% of the maps you will 2 shot some mobs. But gw2 is great at giving fun whatever you like doing.
---
The crefting system is rly nicely done, very few people get deep into it but this game economy wise is very well organized.
---
Gw2 also has a great community. Thind guildies that do the same content as you and enjoy.
---
Anet also announced an allience system for world v world. (server vs server) that may revive the game mode to it's former glory.
---
Hope you enjoy the game.
---
I wonder if Burning Forest is still burning.
---
GW2 is a grinding game but not until after the main storyline. This is what drives me. This game is not about that one item that will make you OP as all stats are the same come endgame. Yes you have different tiers of armor but every item at top tier have the same stats, which makes this game more about skills then anything else.
---
The storyline alone is a huge plethora of awesomeness and while as much as I'm a fan, lacks in some fights. Ultimately its this reason that kept me going. The lore and the fact that "endgame" has so much content to do and isn't about maxing out stats.
---
In regards to the "one item" comment, there is farming for items but its for the skins or value to sell rather then stats.
---
Why wouldn't you want this fixed?
---
Allow me–a person who does not work with you–explain to you how you do your STriKe MiSsiON
---
I agree with you, I think the map has great potential for expanding east and south, whereas the shiverpeaks map we get with EP1 (or 2?) will probably expand north and west.
---
Blocked
---
thank you for going into such detail but keeping it easy to understand :)
---
Only raid content that you can solo is cairn (and escort + river but I would not call those raids)
---
You've got to be a special kind of masochist to play that shit as a charr. I wouldn't know where my hitbox starts and ends.
---
I really like the lore of this universe. It's complex and in-depth, but not to the ridiculous levels that WoW gets up to. 
---
I find things like the interracial politics are really well done. The latest story chapter was all about the politics and it was awesome. But it's often in the little details. Like walking into the Durmand Priory headquarters and finding that a lot of the books are readable. Then, if you're like me, you lose a couple hours reading them all.
---
Or just wandering around and catching a conversation between two NPCs, a charr and a norn, each of them enthusing about the other's racial legends.
---
I got a shoulder chest drop from the bouncy chest.
---
&gt;They sided with the Great Destroyer and Primordious so didn't turn to stone like the Deldrimor.
---
That's news to me, do you remember where you got that from? I was under the impression that all dwarves eventually underwent the ritual and joined the fight against Primordus, no matter what.
---
Podcasts whenever it became too cumbersome. Also it helps me to think "the faster I'm done with it the better" which helped me through the dark phases.
---
God damn gw1 animations were terrible.
---
You can consume them to get [volatile magic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Volatile_Magic) and buy [trophy shipments](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trophy_Shipment). These give materials that you can sell on the TP. It is a fast and easy converstion but is slightly hidden under a level of abstraction ("its account bound, i can't sell it") so many people don't consider their worth.
---
Most the lw4 mats give 15-25 volatile magic (VM) pr mat. Kralkatite ore is the only exception giving only 3-5 VM.
---
5/6 types of lw4 mats then give on average 20 pr mat =&gt; 5000 pr stack.
---
This website lets you see the profitability of different shipments bought with volatile magic: https://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html
---
At the time of this comment it is only at ~86s profit pr trophy shipment but can be seen at ~1g profit pr shipment. Each shipment costs 250VM + 1g. Note that the profit is after the 15% tp tax.
---
If you sell at the right time you can get 250VM ~ 1g.
---
Each stack of lw4 mats give 5000 VM =&gt; 20g.
---
The kralkatite ore is less, 4VM/mat * 250mats = 1000 VM pr stack (~4g).
---
People underestimate the worth of these materials.
---
&gt; What do you all do for fun or to break up monotony?
---
Not using a guide, but doing it on my own. 
---
Everything is way more boring, if you use a guide.
---
gw2 needs more rare drops overall
---
Where does it say that in-game? I expected clues in Sorrow's Embrace but nothing. More over, there isn't even one Stone Summit NPC to corroborate this. I would expect to see one or two of them who are still bitter about having to join with whom they considered to be race traitors. Hell, I would accept a random plaque that references this in-game.
---
Yes and all Sylvari are supposedly awakened by the Pale Tree. There are always outliers and the Stone Summit are strongly opposed to the interracial cooperation. Joining with the Great Dwarf is essentially cosigning the alliance the Deldrimor have with the other races. One line about the Dwarves joining up doesn't mean that it means all of the Dwarves on Tyria. It could just mean all of Deldrimor's allies. Can you honestly say that you believe that xenophobic, racists all of a sudden gave all that up? ANet just engages in lazy lore keeping so that they can always have an answer on hand for persistent questions. They didn't want Dwarf PC's and that's a tidy way of making it impossible.
---
I did the same
---
It's not hard for open world content. I'm playing classic rn and you pull one extra mob and your fucked.
---
What keeps me playing is that i genuinely have fun. As long as i have fun, i'll keep playing.
---
But i would be a lie to say that i don't have any other goal than fun. And there's always something, a skin, an achievement, an item, whatever that i'm chasing after. Usually i have 1 or 2 long term goal that i'll casually and passively work on for months until i'm fairly close to reaching it, then i go full grind mode. And a lot of smaller, short term goals.
---
Current long term goal is to get my pvp legendary armor, short term goal is getting max level cooking, finishing some of the first expac skin collection, getting all the roller beetle race skins, and re-playing the entire story with another character.

It won't matter in PvE. But I've never had an issue communicating in English in any server. I'm from NA, though.

The goggles, they do nothing.

The Commander not controlling Aurene is a WAY more distressing concept. That means an Elder Dragon more powerful than almost anyone has absolutely no authority to keep it from doing what all the others did.
---
Meanwhile the Commander wants everyone to just blindly hope Aurene always remains a good person with no Plan B.
---
Yep, this is definitely it. Did the story but forgot to edit the comment. Still would’ve been nice for them to have some dialogue though.
---
Two questions. 
---
Does this only work with characters before the patch? and can I delete the character after unlocking ability and still retain the account bonus?
---
If you want to communicate in English, don't pick one of the EU worlds dedicated to a different language.  Those are the only places where it might be harder.

The way ANET manages drop rates and expensive items is one of the reasons why I can’t stick with the game for very long. Chak egg, invisible things, queen bee... etc... rng just isn’t fun.

Yeah, I misremembered it, because I had so little interest in it.

I saw a squared circular fuck instead.

You can use Prototype Rewinder during this to save time and not mess up the jumps. Be careful when rewinding though to not land into the detector's line of sight.
---
Yes, that's exactly what I said.  You managed to completely understand the point of my post, which wasn't "I don't think including high value, low drop rng items in collections is a good idea" but was actually "I want everything for free just by logging in."  Congrats, you win the prize.  That prize?  This condescending message.

 hopefully. It's funny!

Next: A picture of the cell, taking a picture of the in-game screenshot.

In Cali we get regular pay + tips (almost everyone tips) but we get taxed up the ass.

Ogden would disagree, in the movement of the world he and rest of the world pretty much believed that when the Charr and Norn fight for the Shiverpeaks there'd be a bloodbath, but instead, and I quote "When the Charr reached the foothills, the Norn drove them back with a single crushing blow, completely decimating every warband sent against them" and as for going 1 vs 1, "warbands and smaller raiding parties could not overcome the individual strength of the Norn", so yeah, they might have big horns, claws and steampunk tanks and rifles, but none of those help when you go against a race of incredible hulks and she-hulks, they'll just toss mountains at you, there's a reason why the Charr lands end near the Shiverpeaks, Norn are that reason, even back in GW1 the Charr and Humans feared or respected Norn enough to halt their centuries long rivalry when passing through Gunnar's hold.
---
It’s not that we are not good people, none of us have gold to give away and/or are trying to make money from harvesting a home instance. Paying for it goes against the entire point.
---
My point was, while immersion and really any of these elements are not *necessary* in making a great open world game (or an open world game at all), they are all strong components that are equal in objective value. Immersive elements *are* critical in making a world feel, well, more immersive. While not being necessary for an open world, it's necessary for a *kind* of open world which has value in its own right. That's the point.  To make these arbitrary distinctions and to suggest that one kind of open world is simply "moot" is not a broad enough perspective about the different qualities open worlds have and functions they can serve.
---
In other words: Every element mentioned in the video and the handfull of additional ones I pointed it out in my critique of the video are additive aspects of game design, which come together to serve the purpose of the actual game. A great open world can be lacking in several of those aspects, but do other aspects very well and it could succeed in being an incredible open world. Each quality has dramatic effect and improvement on the game, while none of them being necessary (unless the open world truly specializes in none, in which of course it's bad). To just dismiss the quality of these different aspects as "moot" is inaccurate and based in subjective taste.
---
**Example:** This is why a game like SKyrim, while lacking in level design and liberal use of copy paste, is lauded as one of the best and most popular open worlds strictly *because* of its open world. Because what it *does* specialize in, it does very well. It lacks attributes of good world design, but succeeds in other equally important aspects (lived in world, immersive elements, seamless world, compelling quests, roleplay elements, etc). Guild wars 2 is the compete opposite, but people still love it for the same reason of loving its open world. What it lacks in immersion and interaction within the world and despite what it looses in being split off into multiple zones, it gains in its level design, focus on exploration, and metroidvania design. Now, for me personally, I value the quality that comes with leudo narrative (dark souls) and immersion (skyrim) enough that gw2's blind spots make me enjoy it less as an open world, but I recognize that that is a subjective opinion. As a game, I still love it regardless.
---
**Basic Thoughts on Open World:** Forgive me, I'm going to go to basics to illustrate my point in another way: In order to view this discussion objectively, I think you have to first define what an open world is and it's something we can all agree on (this would be pretty simple, and it's absolutely the first things that pop into your head). Then recognize that that is the ONLY thing required to constitute an open world game. Once you have that established, then you can start to look at all the qualities that constitute a good open world game. This means that those qualtities don't need to define what an open world *is*, but only what makes it *better* (good level design, metroidvanida design, immersive elements, atmosphere, persistent worlds, leudo narrative, etc). Then it becomes clear that these are like a box of game design tools, and that all serve a different purpose and all can be used in equal potential. **Not every game uses every tool, but every tool can be used to improve a game.** As far as OP's video, I think you can explore WAY deeper into the anatomy of an open world, before you can start critiquing them purely objectively.
---
**Edit:** tried to make the massive block of text more readable
---
**tl;dr:** My criticism is that he has an arbitrarily narrow criteria of what constitutes a good open world game, while completely dismissing opinions outside of his own. When taking a broader perspective, it's obvious that there are many elements that can make an open world great, and they can be implemented in any combination to serve various purposes.
---
It's going to stay high. Four keys each day is just too much, especially when it's time gated.
---
Yes and yes.
---
Is the natural predator just the Anet logo? I don't really follow the patches, so I don't quite get it.
---
I'd recommend Sanctum of Nabkha in Crystal Oasis, it has three chests that spew out rares and whatnot. Also out of curiosity, why do you say you can't raid/wvw/fractals? I was an open world scrub for two years, then spent two years almost purely in wvw and recently started raiding with my guild. It's intimidating but not that hard once you do the first step.
---
To take selfies in front of it ;)
---
I believe I lost a gift of battle this way, Since then I click every bounchy chest up to 5k reward point just to be sure.
---
All I know is I'm excited.
---
i'm confused, how are we supposed to know
---
I presume a joke about how turning into stone is the opposite of being a ghost. They became tangible instead of intangible. :P
---
You didn't totally misremember, it was like you said to start with then they changed it.
---
Joko was always this cartoony villain you never really took seriously in person, even in GW: Nightfall, he was more of a comic relief in person rather than this ominous figure of legend
---
I still don’t know what rev underwater skills do.
---
are you certain about persistence of memory being good? cuz from my brief testing only disenchanter gives some quickness(focus nothing, swordsman baarely 1s)..mindwrack spam might help with alacrity uptime since you run IA anyway
---
good job on the solo though, i was 100% sure it's doable on pchrono
---
I'm still relatively new and casual, so I haven't completed everything 50+ times yet. Dismiss me if you're looking for the people who have been here for all seven years.
---
What I appreciate the most about my day-to-day life in the game? That there's always another way. Gather, earn, or buy map currencies and materials. Starting crafting from the most basic ingredients, or bypass several steps by purchasing refined materials and finished components. Or don't craft at all, buy or earn what you need. Dreaded dailies ask you to finish three tasks, but they offer 12 options to choose from. Mounts are an exquisite set of tools that can be utilised in different ways to reach the same goals. Classes I have played sufficient amounts so far have all provided different approaches to getting through the world.
---
The world surely is big enough. I keep having "what, did they increase the render distance?" moments. There's a lot to notice, and the more you end up using mounts, the more you will inevitably both miss and discover. If 4% refers to World Completion, hearing that it doesn't count expansion and Living World maps might delight you. Some mastery tracks and collections are also hidden until you unlock them through progress or discovery.
---
One gripe I can think of is that many things are doable only once per account. Both mastery insights and hero challenges are dead locations once you have been there, and to a lesser extent various collections. Repeating the same thing over and over again certainly isn't a taboo in an MMORPG, so I feel like neglecting those spots is an oversight. I also wouldn't necessarily be against an option to retrain mounts with new characters. (I'd also love to get access to Living World maps with all characters once one has unlocked them through story. I don't like to do random bits of story/spend sparse consumables whenever I need to get a particular character in a particular map.)
---
On the subject of money, I made my first year without paying for gems. I managed maybe a month with a F2P account, and less than two weeks with just HoT. It got wild quickly, but the game earned it. During that year I exchanged gold for gems for anything I wanted from the gem store, including LWS2 and LWS3. To be fair, I have bought barely any vanity items, I mostly go for bank tabs and character slots. I started buying gems when hoarding for growing ambitions dried up my cash flow. The game didn't bully or abuse me to get my wallet out.
---
I tried the game a couple of times, but it struggled to grab me until I learned about Action Camera. From then on having friends was essential. There is so much you might never discover/experience on your own, speeding up experiencing enough right nuances to separate GW2 from your idea of generic MMORPG and previous worlds that already have your heart. My appreciation and attachment for the world has definitely kept growing as I have continued playing. If you like the character movement and art style, I'm confident there's more than enough to have a great time.
---
For an added achievement layer, the original Guild Wars is still up and connected to acquiring certain rewards in Guild Wars 2.
---
*JUST OPEN THE DAMN GATE, CANACH*
---
I love that moment
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that very same mentality is what burns out a lot of people like OP.
---
Me too... except I bought it on the second day.
---
Feels bad, man.
---
I'm fixin to play through all of the story again... well I might skip season 2 and personal story. Can't wait to see the canach moments again
---
Fuck yes! I love me some physical skills!
---
But... why, though? The recipe is only 23 silver on the TP, and the item it makes is account bound...
---
I mean being allowed to kick defeats the purpose of it in the first place.
---
It's like the world of warcraft blood disease lol
---
Location Wish list to be brought into GW2: 
---
* Anvil Rock
---
* Mineral Springs
---
* Wizard's Folly
---
* **Sanctum Cay** (*Why Tengu, why?**)* 
---
* The Sagelands (They already have a portal for it across the bridge for heaven's sake!)
---
* The place the pathway on the blocked road in Sparkfly Fen! (Which should of lead to Southsun Cove).
---
But then: how are new trees (to burn) able to grow?
---
That's the skyscale, it became earnable in LW season 4's finale episode, War Eternal. You'll need all episodes of season 4 unlocked and a good bit of free time to unlock it. You can read more about the details of the many collection achievements on the skyscale's gw2wiki page.
---
Oy, finally showed up. Not in the location on the wiki though. south of that spot. What a pain.
---
Ohh.. good call!
---
Oof. Wasting a revive orb always feels bad.
---
Persistence of Memory is quite necessary because it acts as a fury generator until you get under 75% where [Master Fencer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Master_Fencer) can kick in and more importantly, provided you hit the first part of [Phantasmal Swordsman](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phantasmal_Swordsman), your first phantasm also gets 8 might in addition to the 8 might you get yourself.
---
The phantasm also gives 3 might to the user for each chain it does, so with chronophantasma it's 6 might.
---
Which means you get a total of 22 (8+8+3+3) might from one use of sword 5 with persistence of memory compared to without PoM where you only get 14 (8+3+3) might, at a much slower pace than with PoM.
---
The small bits of quickness is just a cherry on top.
---
You get it by killing the one beetle at the top which is next to the young ones. This might take several tries and you need to make sure the event isn't up, which the guy below just mentioned.
---
That would be a fucking nightmare and would enable people to grief.
---
That's so odd. Maybe another map?
---
Being thankful I had alts to do the map currency farm.  Two days per map, two maps farmed per day got it over with in a hurry.
---
Either reach the end of the puzzle, or go back to the beginning as soon as you make a mistake. I never got that issue.
---
This isn't something that takes skill.  It's either tons of GP or relying on RNG.
---
Looks like will-o'-wisp produced by the magic released from the cleansed crystals.
---
You must wahter your Cermet so It weel grow beeg and strahng

Thanks
---
Will I understand HoT and PoF stories if I'll skip LW season 2 and 3? I just finished the base story and I'd love to keep going, but I don't have the gold/cash to get the gems and buy the episodes right now.
---
I never noticed this 😂
---
I don't see a problem here. You can't get the most exclusive in game rewards less than a week into a new patch? That's a bad thing?
---
This just makes me want Polymock even more this saga! We should be all over Eye of the North regions.
---
No, you don't need to do any of that. Old armor doesn't need to be retrofitted, old story doesn't need to be playable, and new zones are not necessary, since they could start at level 80 anyway.
---
No game ever goes back to make everything fit the new races. Not even GW1 did with the different profession armor.
---
Insane grinds are a way of (trying) to keep people occupied with minimal content. It's using RNG to pad playtime for the carrot.
---
An added bonus is that it creates a pay to skip the grind incentive, in the form of buying gems to buy gold. Though if there's nothing on the AH, then they may have pushed it too far, or they aren't concerned with monetizing it - just keeping the goal oriented, cosmetic driven players logged in and playing.
---
Gw1 dance is so over-the-top lmao
---
You will in a year, when the saga is finished and Anet adds another collection where you need to have completed all of the content in all of the episodes to get the legendary accessory.
---
You missed Battle of Jahai, or you skipped it on purpose? (would be nice to have even if it overlaps like pre-Searing Ascalon) What about the zone boundary for Battledepths? Also, some of the arena names/regions are still wrong, check that message I sent you a few months ago! :(
---
Great work as always.
---
I played HoT without LS2 and a lot of things made no sense at start. If you can, find some recaps or story gameplays on youtube (including season 1, it comes before season 2 but it's not playable anymore). LS is a big part of the story, especially seasons 3 and 4.
---
I thought it was another Skyscale thing for us to close at first, this being where Kralk woke up from though who knows.
---
Really nice video edit, really bad use of embed html :'D
---
&gt; Why would anyone ever want to see their own name floating above their head is beyond me.
---
It helps to see where the center of your character is for content where positioning is important; just makes it easier to spot your character amidst the chaos; lets you see what guild you're repping if you're multi-guilding often; for lore/consistency reasons.
---
Uhm, are you sure it's not an issue that comes from the title being too long?
---
&gt; So instead, I want to know what are your suggestions to bringing more people into PvP
---
For starters, not AFKing, not botting, not trashtalking.
---
So you are telling me it is not the job of a dh to make use of their superior mobility and roam far all the time? /s
---
My camara isn't even centered on my character. I don't need a name to tell me where I am standing. If my character model is touching an aoe, he's in the aoe. It's that straightforward.
---
its the shaman, it might be a hint friendo
---
As annoying is it was to get just watch tv while you run around collecting crap
---
You cant bring people to pvp when the game is bringing in people who play open world only.
---
Season 5 was probably the only time when pvp was actually populated and thats because ascended gear was handed to you basically for free. Rewards decide what gets played and what doesnt.
---
Even AFTER the antitoxin nerf.
---
What?
---
Correct! Upvoted.
---
They were much nicer in All or Nothing story. Still pretty but not some cheap holographic glittery rainbowness.
---
There's also a gate in the southern limit of the map, near Ooze pit. Maybe they'll expand, or even make a new map in the future.
---
Do some map metas instead of farming. I worked on my A Bug in the System mastery yesterday for a few hours and made about 100 diflourite ore without even realizing it.
---
yup!
---
F
---
No no no, you got it all wrong. The real missed opportunity is with Pyrotorrick. What would've made the event *truly* metal is if he was head banging while fighting us. Having him jam to the music while trying to murder us would've been next level epic.
---
I see, and there we are again with the developers not fixing it since release..
---
Thumper is also great for 3x blast finisher.
---
I stopped fearing and dipped my toes in pvp only recently, after watching WoodenPotatoes' "coach potato" series. Dunno, I made multiple attempts to understand the mode over the years but that series is legit the only thing that worked for me.
---
Yeah, seeing people get precursors right when they started playing vs me never getting one since the headstart really stung in the older times. Nowadays I just don't care and accept I'll never get some stuff and just try to enjoy the story.
---
I don't see why I have to be constructive, when the OP completely mistrued my OP, and claimed that I wanted everything without working for it.  He made a lazy post, and I gave his post all the effort it deserved.  I can only assume this is his alt account, because I don't know why you care so much.
---
I enjoy healing as a tempest a lot. Elementalist as a class is pretty complex but tempest healing is pretty simple.
---
Oh I thought it was the puzzle thing.
---
Druid is the meta healer but it's mostly a buffer  
---
still the to go class for endgame content
---
Tempest is the best healer in terms of sustain  
---
Firebrand is probably the best Burst healer  
---
both not meta for endgame content will gladly be taken as second healer if you allready have a druid
---
oh and yes you will keep your pet
---
i'd like if i could duel people and havethings explained how to do them i guess instead of getting fd, like there are players that play this game since launch in 2012 and know every trait every build and so on and im like trying to squeeze out 7 years of content and specs in the game modes that are availible
---
Did you check if extra strikes count as new node or not? There seems to be a limit for 50ish nodes you can gather a day by swapping maps.
---
It should be noted, 'playing season 2' like that will only let you see the story that takes place within instances.  Some of season 2 happens in the open world talking to various NPCs, and there's no way for players without season 2 to be able to see that.
---
I can neither confirm nor deny, but what I can tell you is that there was a guy ressing me and this did happen yesterday, I just didn't get around to making the post :p
---
With one character?
---
Good point, most of it is very minor but I'll add a note.
---
&gt;implementing the Bazaar was a huge mistake.
---
assuming you're talking about the auction house.
---
Mesmer illusions is the dumbest dogshit ive ever experienced in a pvp gamemode in any game ever
---
Was the "under construction" a pun intended to Said Asura? :V
---
- no more Mirage Cloak while CC'ed
---
- Infinite Horizon gives clones JUST  Ambush skills, no Mirage Cloak
---
- remove the  Break Enemy Targeting function in WvW/PvP on Axe 3 and Illusionary Ambush
---
- summoning Phantasms counts towards the 3 Clones cap, no more 4-6 Illusions at the same time
---
- why is LESSER Chaos Storm just as strong as the normal one?
---
thx
---
BONUS: Clones AA don't apply conditions anymore if not traited with Sharper Images for bleeding. buff Mesmer's AA skills as compensation
---
ya map change works
---
When Bloodstone Fen was new I remember trying to help a player on the airship. They were lying by the waypoint and constantly on fire. Would die after every rez.
---
They also need a downside since every other spec got one
---
the horns would offend people?
---
Who the fuck is playing this game, 50 year old super religious christians? lmfao
---
Except it doesn't spread...
---
MAKE IT SPREAD
---
ok
---
I've gone through waves of extreme PvP obsessiveness, followed by months where I can't bring myself to even enter the mists. It feels like every time I *finally* get comfortable on a build I enjoy (healer scrapper waaah), the balance pendulum swings and I'm forced into something I don't really enjoy, like glassy holo. And then I find myself trying to do, say, healery-supporty things while glassy and making other dumb rotation mistakes. And when I realize how much effort it's going to take to relearn something, I'll go back to PvE for a bit. Same happened when I was doing league stuff, I was having fun playing in my level, but when I vaulted up to a new level and was clearly outclassed by everyone around me, it stopped being fun. (and then you just get yelled at all the time, heh)
---
Honestly, I feel like my tactical skillz are...not that great (not terrible, but I'm not getting on any leaderboards anytime soon), but I don't really know how to get better at this point just playing solo. I will probably check out that "couch potato" series mentioned in the comments here, though! If I could find an active, friendly "learn to play better" pvp guild or something, I'd probably join.
---
that image... he's the former anet director colin johansson, isn't he?
---
If it was Asuara themed it would be a golem....Now Im picturing construction cone shaped mini golems.
---
I never show my name (why would I? I know who I am), problem solved.
---
I used the Raptor to kill the raptors.
---
Looks like a rift, but different since it came from Aurene. May be her traveling through the mists, who knows what it is honestly. 
---
Anyways, sorry didn’t mean to come off rude just that those are more distorted blobs and not solid snowflakes or anything.
---
The problem is they don’t really have MECHANICS, it’s just... kill them before you die.
---
The first/only time I did this adventure, I did it as a charr since I had done the puzzle to get into the hideout as him and didn't want to log out to a different character and do it again.
---
To be honest it wasn't that bad. Then again I do jumping puzzles on my charr on the regular, so I'm sort of used to it.
---
And this is the correct answer
---
Soul Spiral is named Raptor Blender in my heart
---
That’s where multiboxing comes in. Open 3 accounts at a time loot 3 chests at same time with 15 different characters
---
The silver doubloons are nice but not as nice as the 55 laurels and 20 mystic coins per account per monthly cycle
---
Emmmmm who is any of us to say if there's a reason for discussion or not?  
---
I didn't see this 'snow' in game, didn't pay much attention to it, it's interesting.
---
Next update, they should remove [this button](https://imgur.com/ZvR9cb1).
---
Spvp being completely separate from PvE is a fundamental part of the base design and they were aiming for esports right from launch. WvW in the original design was supposed to be a fundamental part of end game.
---
Stalker Visage; Ebon Shoulders; Carapace Jerkin; Falconer's Gloves; Carapace Leggings; Illustrious Striders. 
---
I'd recommend you give a look at Elegy Bracers, it's still nice and compact but juts out just a little more than Falconer's so it looks more cohesive with Ebon Shoulders.
---
I went to go res someone after the fire went out  and it got me. I had no idea what was hitting me for a good 15s. :/
---
Me doing episodes out of order because I get bored easily:  "Braham? When did you get a sense of humor again?!? When did you reacquire your chill?!?" XD
---
It gives me hope to grind through the rest of season 3, because the guy was starting to wear thin on me - it felt like Anet was just constantly shoving the idiot ball at him to run the plot this way and that as needed. He totally had every right to be sad and pissed off after his mom was killed, but it went so far into "anything for revenge" I just kept feeling like literally no one is this stupid.
