I wouldn't mind a Tama-Joko..

"No! Bad Joko! Quit pooping on the floor!!"

See but what people think is content is always different. I play the new story, get all the achievements, get the armor and weapons, while also playing PvP, whatever festival is going on, and a bit of WvW.
---
That's alot of content for me.
---
But there are people put there who rush the story in an hour, and don't care about the many other facets of GW2. The content is there, they just don't like it. To which then I got to ask.....how do you appease those people?
---
but Arenanet didnt know what was best for them, hence why they had to fire 200 something people last year.
---
Not moving the goalposts at all, my point is if a game starts off with a good variety of content then it will attract players who like to play that different content. FFXIV never had good pvp so it never attacted as many pvxers as other games. SWTOR and GW2 began with good pvp as well as pve.
---
The problem with Gw2 is the lack of communication.
---
Many successful games communicate with their community.
---
Gw2 does little to that regard, and we end up with so many problems we want the Devs to see, and Devs end up as people wearing earplugs and blindfolds unleashing wave after wave of "balance changes" to keep the game "fresh" without looking back and seeing wtf they did to screw things up or fix existing design issues.
---
They continue to keep pushing forward and drop little surprise packages of either hype or disappointment behind them, all without looking back.
---
Some people, if not most of the more seasoned players, are getting tired of this pattern. 
---
So they take a break.
---
2012 gamers tended to play multiple MMOs/SP games.
---
2019 gamers tend to binge and move on (# of people who ask what EvE and FF14 are in map chats anymore).....
---
Agree about Warframe. It certainly helps that the combat is quite slick, but I see way more stuff about the fashion.
---
However, it also has another advantage: a competent marketing team. Warframe has monthly content drops available via Nitro and other subscription platforms as a value add - I've never seen Anet once try to drum up interest that way, or by promoting their value-added goods outside of the game. The gemstore is not the worst implementation of a mtx store I've seen, but it's also not the best - there's potential there for it to be improved.
---
EA? xD
---
Nice to hear some better news. Actually it is the 15,6" (there is 14" as well) version and has the (mx150)[https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-IdeaPad-1xx-3xx-5xx-7xx/Lenovo-IdeaPad-530S-15IKB-Does-it-have-MX150-Max-Q-low-power/td-p/4406241] version with higher W.

Sadly as far as i am concerned this laptop can only take one ram, so there is no chance for dual chanel.

So the goal should be 720p lowest settings if i buy this machine?

---
I feel like killing time is a big part of how promos like this get started.
---
You say you play a bit of wvw. Wvw players also play a bit of pve they like.
---
So how come pve gets releases 2-3 times a year,  but wvw releases happen once in 3 years? You appease them as devs by simply showing them that you know they exist.
---
I'll be so happy when all this teapot business ends.  I don't know who that is and I don't care.
---
Because with spvp and wvw anet has neglected both modes for years, refuses to properly resource them and simply mismanages both and doesn't listen. Its not a case of burnout where players can go and come back. There is almost no hope that eirther mode will improve. I know they are still working on alliances for wvw but the player base has declined to such an extent that it is probably irretrievable.
---
That seems like a necessity imo
---
I just want it to make fun of the cat people and say dogs are better just for shit and giggles.
---
Warframe took a turn for the better once their creative director played the game outside the dev room.
---
What happened with Brazil? I only remember his build videos looooong ago
---
I disagree that the GW2 combat system has depth. Anet simply lacks the designer to devise an alternate to the trinity and as a result we have raids with the softets trinity possible.
---
Warframe's combat boils down to press a button to erase all the enemies within 50 meters.
---
Yes we're all well aware of the absolute nose dive the reddit has taken in quality lately
---
That will be a good test to see how long nostalgia can keep people around.
---
You are delusional if you think hardcore raiding died before wvw. WvW was already in decline back in 2014. HoT with its terrible boon spam meta only exasperated it. And PoF was the nail in the coffin
---
&gt; Requiring a target basically ruins the stunbreak aspect of this utility.
---
I mean there must be somebody who stuns you, so there always *is* a target. Using tab before using the skill don't make it unplayable.
---
Teapot streams were aways great, dude is funny, chill and overall a nice person. Teatime however is a mixed bag for me, especially when Brazil was on(I'm Brazilian), I could not watch any teatime with Brazil in it, but teapot will aways be someone I look up to. I hope he comes back.
---
Because people talking about the game as a game and not posting memes are on the actual forum.  
---
The GW2 forum is a ghost town where devs/content creators are nowhere to be seen and a thread can sit at the top of the gen discussion tab for 30 minutes at time with no new posts.
---
Why does it matter to you what other people feel about any game? The important thing here is what you like or don't like, no?
---
Guardian. It can do everything, and its Dragonhunter elite spec is useful in just about everything. DH does huge burst damage which plays into the theme of "kill it before it kills you" that this game operates on. DH has a super simple rotation to learn. DH has mixed range, and is comfortable attacking from melee or long range if necessary.
---
Not even sure anymore tbh. I've been positively hopefully for too long with too many repeated letdowns. I'm scared to hope.
---
Nah, you can stealth and deliver a burst to kill you target if their only stunbreak is a Signet of Air.
---
Does the stunbreak on Signet of Air make sense in your opinion?
---
If they announce a mobile game I am done with GW 2 lol. I am going to mail the friends I made to get their discords/steam and uninstalling that shit. That'd be the biggest fuck you in history to the fans if they go the mobile route lmao
---
GvG still exists in EU and that is the last bastion of hardcore WvW. Though that is slowly leaking players and there will reach a point where the two players that create the tournaments and direct the community (Roy and Domi) will call it quits and then it will be dead. 
---
So no, not delusional.
---
&gt;I am more interested in the possibility of a guild wars 3, with new engine tech, more action-based combat, and a rethinking and simplifying of the various vestigial systems and currencies that plague gw2.
---
There's never going to be a GW3.
---
It is an active detriment to not only my Reddit experience, but others who may wish to join the game. I'd love to see more art and memes and funny videos, things that show the game is going strong like it actually is, compared to the apocalyptic mess people make things out to be. 
---
Imagine coming to this subreddit as new person, filtering by top of all time, and seeing.....
---
Like 4 things about Jessica Price, one about mount adoption license, and another about not pre-ordering HoT. Compare that to the 2-3 positive things. It says alot about this community that upvotes are mostly fueled by anger.
---

---
I would love to explore north, those were always my favourite zones, maybe except for dredge locations. What I would give for a playable Kodan. I would name it Tuunbaq.
---
Kodan revenant with a floating greatsword. Ah, one can dream.
---
I only know Monstrum and Dagos
---
The other question to ask is if they return in the same capacity. I'm in an old guild with a lot of vets that come back sometimes, although the majority have left. 
---
This guild has lots of old commanders, people who used to take control of the timezone, organize the community or rally for hours in WvW to win. 
---
Now if they come back they meme around a bit, maybe join a guild raid once and catch up with us. But it's not the same. When you lose community or vets you lose their motivation to contribute. Nowadays you see one substantial tag a timezone in WvW NA on all but the busiest servers. If all these guild players who log in once a month were all playing as if they cared,  the commander shortage would be easily solved, but obviously there's no reason to try to anymore. I don't doubt a majority of returning vets don't return as vets, even if they return. That's another unfortunate dimension of the veteran leaving problem.
---
choya are what quaggans should have been from the beginning
---
Except those creators are leaving the game sooooooo
---
People basically quit playing before the release, came back for Wing 7, returned, took their few hours to kill it and then left again, because after 9 months of waiting they were disappointed with what they got.
---
Other people (myself included) were a bit disgruntled and basically only waited for that release. After it was a massive letdown in difficulty (and this time even on the "Challenge Mode" difficulty, which barely changed anything on two out of the three bosses), we were just reflecting over the past, and basically quit.
---
The third point is that for the first time since raids exist, we do not know whether there is a raid in development. Combine that with the layoffs affecting Raid and/or Fractal releases for the first time (the majority of the latest Raid Wing got completed before the layoffs), people are looking for alternatives. Granted, it is not on the same level as WvW (I was a WvW player and became a raid- and fractal player due to neglect).
---
The fact that you know next to nothing about the way hardcore raiding and the motivation to do so works, says a lot more about the validity of your point than about us eLiTe RaIdErS.
---
It's a more casual guild. And yeah, after playing anything for thousands ofhours, I'd play less, no mater what it was. You guys are acting like somehow, after thousands of hours in any game, you're going to put the same time and energy into it, but people move on.
---
WoW is arguably the most popular MMO of all time. It peaked about 12.4 million subscribers. People come back for 3-6 months after an expansion. play all the content and leave until the next expansion. They stopped reporting subs when it dipped below 4 million.  Are we really thinking that this is somehow not normal for a 7 year old game?
---

---
What i find to be really sad is that Teapot made a event that he should be appreciated for. It was very well organized event and much liked. 
---
But instead of putting all the focus on this and let reddit be about this, players are litterally drowning reddit in Arena Net hate and all the effort Teapot put in to this just kind of drowns in the hate posts. I think this is very sad and he deserves better then that. 
---
People need to pick their battles. there is a time for everything and as of right now it should be about the good thing he did with this event.
---
Launch? As if its already finished? Huh..
---
MMOs are community games, with enough community hype people get drawn to it. Releasing living story isn't going to draw community to it. Substantial content or difficulty or excitement is what unites the community. It'll definitely be interesting to see how WoW classic does. Even i'm interested because so many people I know are going to play it.
---
&gt;Hey look guys, it's a big resource drain! 
---
Laughs in Anet ONE man team for both fractals and raids combined.
---
I think every PC developer learned from Blizzard not to announce a mobile game to an all-PC player crowd.
---
Could probably pull fullhd too but not the best performance. Why not a gaming laptop?
---
&gt;CC the seekers
---
I just used gs 5 from guardian on them and my group kicked me wtf isn't that a cc??
---
FYI - OP is full of shit.  He's been arguing in his post that there's nothing wrong with PvP and WvW.
---
is this really necessary
---
The sad thing is I can definitely see Anet releasing a mobile version of the game. :\
---
No its not but humour them
---
what
---
All skills should check for all of these things before casting...
---
You can use [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com "also /r/Enhancement") to filter out posts.
---
I love this
---
So in your mind, bigger teams will be more efficient in solving balance problems and population woes in WvW? I don't quite buy that logic.
---
Blizzard devs surely plays gw2
---
Did you read my comment? Population isn't an issue I care about. I'm a 100% fights player, no server loyalty, go where the fights are. What I want for them is to actively develop the mode. As of now, there's one person working steadily on wvw.
---
GW2 will be fine too.  It may irritate people, but it doesn't make it any less true.  Yes, the competitive scenes will suffer a bit, but it won't make a noticeable difference for the casual majority.  Time will tell.
---
Ranked btw.
---
I generally agree.
---
Who tags up to lead casual players in open world? Who writes and curates guides that casual players use to build characters and tackle content? Who prowls reddit and other gaming communities advocating for the game by word of mouth? Who demonstrates that the game is more than spamming 1, inspiring and creating potential goals for others?
---
I'm of the firm belief that hardcore players have a disproportionately positive impact on the game's overall health compared to how many of them exist. One of the best selling points of MMOs is how they create communities with many different types of people and create a middle ground for those people to interact. Pretending that the whole isn't meaningfully affected by the loss of hardcore players is like cutting off your hand and pretending everything's fine because it was a small percent of your body mass.
---
Greatsword and (anyweapon)/axe is a fine combination to solo content. Rangers are definintely not WoW's hunters, and having played both I prefer ranger for flexibility any day.
---
Because much more players play pve. That is why. How difficult can it be to grasp such a simple concept? The game is a business, not a charity.
---
Check my submission history, i literally just did a huge analysis comparing gem store vs in game rewards over time. Gem store offerings have really not gone up.
---
Not only boring to watch, hard to watch too, all those in game vfx are just too much.
---
no, it's your part to check it the target is possible to hit or not. this game aint on easy mode
---
When you don't know if you should laugh or cry.
---
Get your red shirt ready.
---
Cantha has a dragon, which is one of the elder dragons. Dragon of the deep which slumbers in the sea of sorrows between cantha and tyria. So not sure why you think they wouldn't follow elder dragon progression with expansions.
---
Jesus. I'm not ready for GW2M.
---
Easiest money for Anet , ban the bots so they can buy the game again and again and again :D
---
And here I thought it must be a murican thing. Because you don't see any of this in the actual game.
---
Looks balanced.
---
Ironically LN used a heal scourge at Qadim2 in the finals. Barrier, boon strip, cc and almost constant 1k transfusion ticks are a huge deal.
---
The best filter for it is the "wait 24 hours" filter.
---
Around 24 hours from now, with a new patch having dropped, no one will be talking about it anymore.
---
I they bring back the Novelty Selection Box I would like it to come with currently unobtainable novelties. There are a few in the game right now that are listed in the interface that you just can't get anymore.
---
They are like the Elin of quaggan, they all look like babies.
---
can we please stop the bad meme of druid (and now apparently FB) are bAd At HeAlIng
---
it's not true, they are extremely good at it because their burst heals are easily identifiable, accessible, and easy-to-use-on-demand compared to the likes of others, augmented with utility that isn't conditionally locked away (a major weakness of heal renegade/herald), as well as very useful boons, including several powerful defensive ones for fb in particular - i dont think anyhting comes close to the sheer size of the toolbox fb has which makes it extremely versatile and its burst healing with tome of resolve and bow of truth is absolutely huge. 
---
heal fb is... definitely not the worse. big healing numbers mean nothing if the way of delivering them is extremely clunky and in a small aoe (revenant ventari, med kit) compared to large area of effect and ease of use (druid, firebrand, tempest). this, combined with the ability to provide quickness and a not insignificant amount of might, means that fb ends up being one of the most reliable healers, not among the worse. low healing numbers, so what? it's reliable and it evidently works, as pugs have caught onto, need to hard carry a boss? heal fb should be your go-to as you can provide aegis, stability, permanent quickness, and a lot of might to your subgroup, and you are even able to tank somewhat effectively should you need to. it's the new chaos chrono.
---
hes not asking you to give him free hsit, hes asking if there is someone giving out free shit
---
Imagine even just a "Coliseum Fractal".
---
One boss in the same Story stage presented to you just like a "random fractal fracture that needs to be solved".
---
Story Bosses reworked to be done on a party level ( see even the final HoT story fight on "challenge mode" ).
---
Cost of assets? Almost zero.
---
Actual programming involved? Much less than new content.
---
And you could easily build 3-4 fractals with 3 encounters each like that, with like some steps of the story ( HoT one being for example VB Wyverns, Mordrem Faolain, Mordremoth Champions Trio &amp; Mordremoth ).
---
Is it rehashed content? Of course it is, but it's new content to do with people so we do not starve for months! Who wouldn't want that in between major new releases?
---
Yep, these were those kind of bots.Praise the singularity overlord!
---
Same thing that is happening with PvP, wvw and raids/fractals. A lack of support from arenanets side.
---
Also a big shoutout to my boy Darkrazor's Daring, a stunbreak that requires ground targeting and unreliable summon pathing!
---
Thanks, I'll start with the other suggestions and keep this one in my back pocket just in case.
---
I was on that map, 10s+ skill lag sitting in spawn. Couldn't even mount.
---
They canceled all other active projects just months ago, laid off 150 people and moved the resr back onto GW2. **Very unlikely.**
---
I completely agree with you, I only mentioned the milestone and that's all
---
&gt; Why do you say the dungeon feature failed?
---
The caboose on this week's hate train.
---
They didn't fail, they were instead abandoned.
---
Any Aussie winners?
---
Some issues:
---
- Awful understanding of class balance. Warriors and Elementalists only.
---
- No roles. All damage, all the time. Or skip.
---
- easy cheesy.
---
I think the bigger reality we have to accept is that they have done this three times already and, as you admit yourself, have *failed every single time*. Either this development team literally cannot explain their own game no matter how hard they try, *or* they are misunderstanding their target demographic and do not know how to navigate their target audience in an appropriate way.
---
Considering the fact that GW2 also cannot cater to *veteran* players either - anybody with enough hours into GW2 and one or two level 80s is going to understand that there is no vertical gear progression and so "Fashion Wars" is the only real endgame goal with any longevity to it. Worse still, anybody that has played through both HoT and PoF is able to see the drastic shift in company policy and focus - while HoT had many collections and collectables that encouraged players to play in maps and metas *without* leaving players feeling like they'd wasted their time or been cheated, PoF has barely any such thing. Bounty Hunter set is crafted only, Warbeast is crafted only through RNG recipe drops or trading post (or a lucky RNG drop of the actual amour) and Requiem was disgustingly time-gated as well as a terribly designed *disaster* of mat gathering (aka the Sigil of Nullification issue.) The only actual decent armour set we have from PoF is the Mist Shard set, which feels like a decent reward for getting the base set via playing the map and then doesn't feel like a total shitfest to get the Blossoming upgrade for Mistborn Motes by also still playing the meta.
---
So now we have a company that *can't* manage to explain the game to new players, despite three attempts, and isn't even *trying* to make content for veteran players any more. You also can't fix these issues at the same time. Both of them are so glaringly obvious, and ArenaNet's proven so historically incompetent, that you can only realistic tackle *one* of these issues at a time. So which issue is it? And if you decide it's the new player issue, how are you going to get this incompetent development team to achieve a *fourth* time when their previous *three* attempts all dismally failed?
---
You're going to bleed players either way.
---
It works both ways as "end game" pve content in Prophesies was pvp content for the most part.  
---
Fissure of Woe and Underworld could be considered end game, but even those required your region to win the Hall of Heroes initially.  
---
There were a lot of design choices in vanilla GW1 that implied PvE was meant more as a way to introduce combat mechanics in a fun, organic way to ease a broad audience into pvp in a time before the rise of competitive online gaming outside of arena shooters.  
---
GW1 didn't really become a true PvE focused game until Nightfall. Things were shifting in Factions but they still had Alliance battles that adjusted npc vendors on the pve map and the Jade Quarry and Fort Aspenwood were locations on the pve map.
---
I don't get it. All raid sell lfgs barely have variations
---
&gt; Not being supported activitely is not the same as failure. 
---
Yes, it pretty much is the same as failure.
---
If it hadn't failed, it would still be getting updated. The fact that it's not getting updated, means Anet views it as a failure.
---
Fractals, Raids, and open world metas have continued getting new updates &amp; content... Dungeons have not... This isn't rocket science mate.
---
&gt; Thinking the featured failed is the wrong way to think about it. The game has simply evolved. 
---
Fair enough.... But they're still a failure in reference to **todays** Guild Wars.
---
Sure they weren't a failure at the time of their release, but they are now.
---
&gt; What actually happened was Anet figured out that making Fractals is faster/easier than dungeons. Fractals have some built in advantages. 
---
Anet figuring out they can make faster/easier content with advantages, which they couldn't do for Dungeons... Inherently means that Anet failed with their foundational design for Dungeons.
---
\-
---
Just to clarify, i'm not at all trying to say that the Dungeon content itself is bad... Just that Anet failed at designing it by using messy spaghetti code to create it, which couldn't be easily built upon or altered... Which resulted in them abandoning it and settling for a faster/easier (as you said) content to create.
---
This ultimately **does** mean that the dungeon system they originally created has now failed.
---
Why? It's literally just watching a red bar--or really, a percentage--go down. What is exciting about this? Even if you knew what everyone's skills did, you can't actually see anything. Even the casters, who supposedly would have a good knowledge of what's going on, just shout about the % health remaining. This is the most boring shit I've ever seen, and I love watching videogames.
---
I feel like a lot of this comment is you being jaded due to being a long-time player of the game. As a veteran myself, I understand where you're coming from with a lot of your points, but it's very easy to *feel* like the game's heading in a worse and worse state just because our enthusiasm for it is.
---
The point I agree with you 100% on is the communication. That has clearly taken a turn for the worse. No more Reddit AMAs or even forum AMAs, no more community showcases on their Twitch, almost no more developer responses on Reddit... their interaction with the community seems mostly tied to Guild Chat, patch notes, blog announcements, and uninteresting/exclusive sweepstakes and partnerships, which I find a massive shame. Communication was never *perfect* but I certainly don't recall it being this quiet.
---
Re: the gemstore... it has almost always been pushed to a degree similar to this one. Apart from the (rather unremarkable) legendary backpiece gliders, there are no gliders we can obtain in-game. There are no outfits we can obtain in-game. The fact that there are no mount skins we can obtain in-game is not new. We've had flashy outfits that outshine legendary armour for a long time. 
---
Your point on in-game rewards being increasingly barren is incredibly untrue. The [opposite](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ckqmvw/a_thorough_overview_of_ingame_rewards_from_hot/) is the case. We've been getting armour skins, weapon skins, stat sets, legendaries, and novelties in this game that can be obtained through gameplay at a higher rate than we'd ever enjoyed. Whether or not you *enjoy* that gameplay is another story, but if you look at stuff like Vision, Elegy armour, Dragonsblood weapons, Coalescence, Skyscale, etc they all require all sorts of gameplay from adventures to story achievements to events to bounties to raids to world bosses. If you find that gameplay shallow compared to what we had before, then I don't know what to tell you. I'll take this any day from gambling for precursors in the mystic forge, running CoF p1 every day, and fixing sign posts.
---
The legendary collections are certainly in a worse spot than they were following HoT's immediate release, but the old collections had their own issues too; collection steps that required events to fail, bugs, waiting for 1hour+ for an event to spawn, etc. Might I also add that ArenaNet was quite clear with us on *why* they made it this way; the old legendary collections were just not sustainable. After the legendary weapons were "indefinitely postponed", I distinctly recall many people on Reddit urging ArenaNet to *scrap* those collections and go for a simpler acquisition if it meant we got our legendary weapons, which is exactly what the devs did. We lose out on a lot of flavour, yes, but the weapons themselves are still very popular and well-received and they work well as long-term goals that keep people playing the game.
---
Finally, regarding timegates; yeah, they are annoying, and I especially don't enjoy senseless timegates like being forced to wait for a day for Gorrik to finish his Skyscale research (glad they at least changed that to 2 hours)... but again, they were always a thing. Charged Quartz Crystals, Laurels, ascended materials, Mawdrey's collection items, Pact Supply Network Agents... I can go on and on. Like it or not, timegates are very much an integral part of this game and, indeed, of many games of this nature.
---
There are good reasons for timegates beyond padding out content by the way; they allow content to feel rewarding for all people, since they make it impossible for those rewards to be farmed by people who play the game 24/7, causing insane inflation and widening the gap between new players and veterans. They entice people to log in more often rather than consume all the content straight away... and honestly, does it really matter in the long run if it takes a week to get your Skyscale instead of no-lifing it in a 6 hours? Timegates are nothing more than a minor annoyance that is in a fair few cases even *beneficial* for the game.
---
Again, I certainly get where you're coming from and I also know that the 30th has to be a pretty spectacular announcement since it does feel like the playerbase needs a bit of a morale boost, but I also invite you to try and separate what you consider issues with the game and what is actually you needing to accept that you're getting burnt out.
---
Anet made a business decision based on the amount of time it would take to update. It's an efficiency concern, nothing more. They experimented, found a more efficient way to do business and of course you move to the more efficient way. Dungeons are just defined as five man instanced content in this game. Fractals are dungeons for all practical purposes. The original dungeons took longer to create. That's all. It's not failed content. It's superceded content. 
---
It's like saying old movies failed because there are new movies. That's not the case.  In a business with a limited amount of development time, the more efficient development is likely to receive support.
---
&gt; We just got fractal updates, 
---
The last fractal update was ages ago dude... We currently get a new fractal almost once a year.
---
&gt;  a new raid 
---
A new raid every 9 months... Which wasn't even that good.
---
&gt; and new PvP and WvW weapons. 
---
Wow... New weapon skins.... That **totally** qualifies as significant pvp/wvw content updates    /s
---
Are you counting information about season 5 as content that is new? It is, at least, unreleased. They already said they would have info on that. Are you expecting information about content AFTER season 5? I wouldn't expect anything concrete for that at all.
---
&gt;  It's an efficiency concern, nothing more. 
---
That's my point... Dungeons not being efficient enough to continue supporting was a failure on Anets design/coding team.
---
&gt; It's like saying old movies failed because there are new movies. 
---
Not quite, 
---
It's more like saying an anime like bleach was ended.... Whereas it's peers like Naruto &amp; Once Piece, which were originally being aired at the same time, continued airing for several years after Bleach was cancelled.
---
The way Bleach prematurely ended is for all intents and purposes considered a failure (either a failure on the part of the studio, or the writer), when compared to its peers like Naruto &amp; One Piece.
---
It's all relative. It needs to be compared to the other content that was in the game at the time. Sure if you look at Dungeons as a stand-alone feature, it's solid &amp; enjoyable content, but relative to the context of the rest of the game it still failed to continue.
---
&gt;WoW classic

lel
---
outdated riding on massive tsunami waves of nostalgia
---
people will log in and not be able to figure out why they thought it was a good idea
---
It’s a mixed bag, I don’t really find the PVE community at large to be all that toxic in general though, PVP is some kind dumpsterfire covered in oil though.
---
&gt;Hell, even a simple Skyscale collection made people go frenzy just because they didn't get it quicker.
---
Skyscale's problems have more to do with Anet putting up hard time locks that slowed down people who did want to "no life" the content but couldn't and the content itself being brain melting'ly boring  
---
Don't make me scavenger hunt sick dragons right after I scavenger hunt their shed scales. It's just the same boring shit with a different hat.
---
Fractals were the replacement. Raids are the dungeona of HoT/PoF
---
&gt; Because there was a point in time when endgame content was at its peak
---
When was that? I can't remember a single moment in the 7 years I've been on this subreddit. 
---
&gt; at least agree with me that this 1% of the community is by far the loudest, and if they're gone, then it's all downhill from there.
---
I agree they are loud, but why would it be downhill if SC and DT are gone? Teapot is a shame tho. 
---
&gt; content drought has been the reason this game is declining for like the past 2 years.
---
Nothing has happened these past 2 years?
---
Yes. We should remove dying from the game too.
---
&gt; We got reworks to existing fractals. That is an update. 
---
They reworked 2 encounters, out of almost 200 encounters.
---
If you consider that good enough "new" content to be added in a year... Then fair enough, hope you enjoy it... To me that's still considered neglect.
---
&gt; You can't just pick and choose updates. Any update is an update  
---
Sure, but i'm allowed to pick and choose what i consider to be satisfactory for the time i need to wait.
---
&gt; We got a new 2v2 map and another map added to the ranked rotation.  
---
A 2vs2 map with no queue system... And another map added to the ranked rotation which was created over a year ago.
---
&gt; Also ignoring an update because it 'wasn't even that good' does not mean that content is dead or ignored by Anet.  
---
If a system in an MMO receives a minuscule update every year, many many people would agree it's essentially dead or ignored.
---
Being dead/ignored doesn't mean being **literally** forgotten about... It's a figure of speech to describe it's not getting relevant enough content in a reasonable enough time frame.
---
&gt; Attitudes like this are what is killing raiding, not Anet. 
---
No, the new raid being a bad raid is what's killing raiding, which was designed by Anet, therefor i have every right to place the blame on them.
---
Certain bosses were literally killed on the **first** attempt... That's how easy it was. 
---
It may have been worth the 9 month wait for you, that's fine, but it wasn't worth the wait for most of the raiding community, thus people say it's dying.
---
You're essentially trying to say we aren't allowed to dislike content, and should keep our mouths shut and not criticize anything because Anet can do no wrong.
---
These guys (with the exception of Jawgeous and his move) can always come back and likely would come back if things changed.  
---
It's simply a coincidence that things have fallen apart now while also allowing this all to sort of act as a soft ultimatum for Anet.  
---
It's also a safe bet that we aren't going to see the announcement of new instanced content or pvp/wvw stuff on the 30th. It's possible but news about LW5 is the most likely outcome which is why a lot of people are leaving.
---
Factions was the point where they started the transition  
---
I don't think nightfall had any pvp specific content other than guildhalls that I can remember
---
Just like most games, they will end up leaving it too.
---
I don't see how the image shows they're bots.
---
&gt;  If constructive criticism gave us the features we wanted, we'd have gotten them long ago.
---
The only alternative then is to move on with your day. Nonconstructive criticism is actively destructive, and people who make it generally know that and want it. If you genuinely think constructive criticism is pointless maybe don't say anything at all?
---
I also think it's BS to say constructive criticism doesn't get anything done. The dye system was changed since its original inception over constructive criticism. The design of PoF maps as being less meta focused than HoT ones is actually a reaction to heavy criticism HoT got for being ONLY about meta maps. Some of the design features of Desert Borderlands are the results of constructive criticisms, and the addition of gliding since is also one of them. 
---
Nothing is perfect in game design, you can't make 100% of players happy 100% of time and sometimes the famous WoW saying "You think you do but you don't" is actually true. Sometimes it's degrees of true, I still think HoT was too meta focused, I also think PoF didn't focus enough on metas, fine tuning criticism and moving the needle over time. Game development takes a long time, just look at the WvW alliance system.
---
I understand the community reaction - we see something like this every couple of years, but that in no way excuses it or makes it any less ridiculous.
---
Well, only about 10% of the people on GW2 Efficiency (which would skew towards non-casuals) have *any* significant amount of Legendary Insights, so that seems to indicate that raiding isn't a thing most players do regularly. Only 1% have any Divinations, so even less are doing *recent* raids. At least half the players on there are below Fractal 50. Less than 10% have an "Immortal" skin, those are PvP, right? Less then 50% of players are above WvW rank 37. 
---
I don't know, we obviously don't have specific data as to exactly how many players are casuals, just as you have no data that casuals spend more gems, but what evidence we do have seem to indicate pretty strongly that casuals make up a large percent of the population. What evidence to the contrary do you have?
---
&gt; Great explanation but i cannot but think that having this vid out the day before erp would've saved us from alot of the unecessary fiesta.
---
Do you honestly think the stream would have been as popular if it had _just_ been a raid stream? Compare the comments in the reddit threads actually talking about anything to do with the ERP event, the teams, the moments in the competition or the commentary (of even look at the twitch chat during the stream). Compare that to the volume of comments bashing ArenaNet and spreading drama, focused entirely on how victimized raiders and "veterans" are, how dead GW2 is and any other grievance. They far outweigh in volume and intensity any actual discussion of what was happening on the stream.
---
The grievances, the angry mob, that is part of the brand. It eclipsed the actual event itself in discussions.
---
So this is how we feel in PvE, then you got the poor PvP and WvWers. What other game mode is left again? Oh wait. Big yikes for anyone remotely hardcore :C
---
Every group wants *a* warrior. Not two or more warriors. Necro has a bit of a stigma about it outside the fights where Epidemic matters. Guardian (power dgh, condi fbd) is exactly what you're looking for. High performance at entry level, scales with you as you git gud, usable in open world, every group wants 'em.
---
Often times, people confuse good players or people doing well in a match with bots. I play in the same tier as these guys (had Marchand with them tonight) and I don’t ever encounter bots.
---
I'm not sure what you mean. They didn't fail, they were wildly popular as a gold farm. Anet stopped supporting them in favour of a more modern, better coded, innovative form of dungeons: fractals. Dungeons only lost the vast majority of their players once the gold went somewhere else. Naturally, everyone followed the gold. Ironically, dungeons are still (again) one of the best gold farms in the game, but people meme'd themselves into the believe that dungaons r ded, and that's that.
---
What's the end-game like?
---
Well, they've more or less said that it's Living Story fluff, so barring any special surprises, it's more or less going to be same-old, same-old.
---
I'm probably going to be referencing these repeatedly when I get back to raid training. Thanks.
---
Fail if you look up the word instead of the synonym has nothing to do with negligence. It has to do with not performing the function for which it was designed.  Dungeons offer 5 man instanced content for groups of people to get specific armor skins. They are indeed exactly what they were designed for. 
---
You might argue they failed because we know how to do them.
---
When you make a movie, you never go back to that movie ever. You've made it. And there are many succesful movies that never had a remake. They're just successful movies. Casa Blanca was never revisted, but no one would say it's not a successful movie. 
---
Negligence is NOT a synonom for fail. I typed in fail at theasurus. com and negligence doesn't come up at all. This is one of the biggest issues of editing professionally for so many years. People want words to have very specific meanings.
---
If a business fails, it closes. It doesn't keep going breaking even. That's not failure.
---
Dungeons are more profitable now to run than they were at launch, and people still run them. This isn't failure. Something that's superceded hasn't failed. Records are broken all the time, but people who came before aren't called failures.
---
This is simply a misuse of the language in order for you to prove a point. You could have easily asked why are dungeons not made any more, without using the contentious wording and I'd probably not have even posted in the thread. But lots of things were successful and they're not made any more.
---
It didn't, ArenaNet moved into fractals. Back in 2012 when fractals released they were more popular than dungeons - they were shorter, they had more enjoyable mechanics (because they were newer and benefited from lessons learned and new tech) and most importantly - fractals have the level scaling system that the most successful dungeons in MMOs use.
---
It's honestly hard to argue that fractals aren't dungeons, at least in the way MMO's generally define dungeons. Five player instanced content against mobs that are harder than open world mobs, with several bosses layered throughout and generally better loot for your trouble.
---
I think the problem with fractals is it never perfectly replaced dungeons for a variety of reasons. One, the cosmetic rewards are inferior. Dungeons in GW2 had their own unique armor and weapon skins (this is something even WoW doesn't do for each dungeon). Fractals have a backpack and two colour variations of the same weapon set. While fractals have the ability to be anywhere in time (or possibly even an alternate time), they lack narrative weight because what happens in them isn't canon reality, it's alternate reality. The original dungeons offered GW2 the ability to give a satisfying conclusion to lesser enemies (the Flame Legion in CoF) than what the main story is able to deal with (Elder Dragons). This strengthens the world building and the diversity of GW2's villains and places.
---
Probably the biggest weakness of fractals is the agony system, and it's also one of the biggest reasons why dungeons were superior. A full set of infused ascended gear for a single build of a single class is a massive investment. It's required for T4 fractals (the only tier worth running) while any player can walk into any dungeon in full exotics and clear it in exotics or lower. You can easily clear raids in full exotics. This makes gearing your characters much easier for dungeons (and ironically the more hardcore raids) than gearing them for fractals. If I love the recent balance changes to mesmer but I didn't already have one, I can easily pull out some exotics and make a viable dungeon build for one. If they just nerfed druid and I want to try support firebrand, I can easily gear one for dungeons. If I just want to play a different class each day to break up the monotony of repetition I can easily gear multiple characters. I can't do that with ascended because it's so expensive. A single set is a huge investment - and this actually is most important for new players. I find it difficult to bring in players from other game modes (raiders, WvW players, new players) into fratals because they don't have agony resist. They literally can't play through content they are skilled enough to survive (especially raiders) because their gear isn't infused (their only ascended set might have WvW infusions in it and it might be minstrels or some other PvP stat). Anyone can step into a dungeon and contribute well, fractals are group content that limits your pool of potential team mates.
---
As I mentioned earlier, the most successful MMO dungeons today have difficulty scaling. This is probably done best in WoW with it's difficulty levels (normal, heroic and mythic) and the mythic keystone scaling. This system is similar to GW2's fractal scaling system, but unlike GW2 the gear requirements are a lot less restrictive on new people and the primary rewards are better gear as opposed to gold, so anyone doing the appropriate difficulty for their gear level is appropriately rewarded, making all difficulties rewarding (whereas only T4 fractals are worth doing in GW2, making progression levels pointless for most people).
---
Fractals really are dungeons, but they have both world building and lore issues (they are alternate realities which is a double edged sword for story telling - the opportunity to see different timelines, far away places, alternate versions of events, but no ability to drive the story forward or influence the current timeline) and they have massive accessibility issues for people starting out in them.
---
Jazz hands
---
Season 5 would also be quite horrible at this point- considering how long it takes to release each episode and how little content they have.  
---
They need more than one little map with an hour of the story to keep the game alive.
---
No, I have a phone.
---
Failure is not fail. Failure is not a verb. You asked why did the dungeons fail as in they were doing something and then they weren't doing it any more. It's just not true. Look up the verb fail, the actual word you used because that's sort of how English works. Furthermore, there's such a thing in English as connotation. Failure has a certain conotation. Something that's failed isn't usally still around. If a dam fails, it stops serving it's purpose. Not making new dungeons doesn't stop the dungeons that exist from serving their original purpose.  
---
Moving forward the company found a more efficient way to create five man instanced content. But that doesn't mean that the old dungeons have failed. It's almost like you think everyone whos' retired has failed because they're no longer working on their career.
---
  
---
Dungeons would have to be removed from the game for them to be considered failures. Look up the word you used next time, instead of a similar one.
---
I wouldn't call it an outright failure, as the dungeons did and are still doing the thing they were built for: An interesting story with some formerly unique bosses meant to allow people to obtain some stunning looking gear.
---
Dungeons are still playable, and they still follow that purpose: Anyone can go do ascalonian catacombs to get the ascalonian weapons and armor, so their purpose is still there.
---
However, for those seeking greater challenge out of their group content, they were meant to go do fractals and later on the raids that were released. As the effort to make three new sets of gear and a set of weapons for each new dungeon is significantly higher than what they were willing to spend, they decided to try and keep people interested in fractals instead, which are easier to just throw the occasional new weapon or weapon set at to keep relevant.
---
True dungeons are unlikely to come back, but I'd say that what was left behind is still good for what it gave us.
---
Anet has support?
---
Queue problems - like lack of certain people, repetitive and most of all - worthless rewards.
---
Imagine being such an elitist, even the environment is shining.
---
PM me and we'll figure it out.
---
&gt;Dying used to mean at least paying some silver to repair your gear. We don't even have that anymore. I half expect them to sell an infinite use revive orb in the gem store that resses you in 10 seconds at some point just to do away with "release and run back" as well. 
---
lol paying a couple of silver for dying was completely pointless. Waypoints already end up costing much more than dying ever did, and I don't think that anyone cares about way point costs.
---
Because they took away rewards that made it worthwhile
---
Its an mmo. You are not supposed to have two mmos you play because theres not enough time in a day. If an mmo tells you to take a break and come when content is present, it fails as an mmo
---
Good points and good analogy with the TV shows....I'll use that later.
---
The demand for content is to high these days. I was hoping concerns for game devs and excessive crunch would stem that tide but I dunno.
---
unfortunate that their watches are kinds garbage...
---
People come back for 3-6 months for an expansion.
---
I know people who were done with PoF a week after release. Ante up
---
Ugh, Jormag instead of Bubbles? Would be nice to get something new for once.
---
I guess you're not counting the new fractal, wing 7 as part of the PoF content. Do you count the raid content in WoW or not?
---
&gt;especially combined with the recent "leak" of a "new game" on one of the instagram partner ads.
---
Although it is interesting on what unravels, I wouldn't say its a leak... the watch company could have easily got itself confused with Guildwars 2 and Living Story season 5
---
For sure guys! Check out his work, it's amazing!!!
---
I think it's just the toll of a 7-years old online game, I mean, it's a lot, just consider that 15k hours means over 5hrs per day, that may mean you didn't have time to play stuff like Skyrim, The Witcher, even the later Mass Effects perhaps.  A lot of stuff got released through the years and that just cycled players.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Though I always thought GW2 bit more than it could chew from the very beginning, they wanted to inherit their pvp model from the base game but doing so they delivered a sub par mode that's hard to maintain, refresh and balance while having it make sense with the rest, meanwhile you could find other -exclusively- pvp games that would deliver such an experience, without compromising for other game modes and as such became successful at what they did best, because they stuck to their guns.
---
That was all clear since day1, in time they added progressive things like cosmetics related to achievements (achievement points) but never really used the system to standardize what was already in place, nor used it for any future improvements, then they added new stat combinations without really standardizing their acquisition or even introducing'em through obscure achievements, all while everyone thought GW2 was all about inclusion they tried again and again in dividing their own playerbase, succeeding.
---
I think it all added up through the years, and they were right to work on improving the game these late few months but I honestly didn't see what changed, too little too late I guess, so yeah that does fall on management.
---
Piss poor design. The stories were fine. Dungeons became Stack behind a pebble on the ground to break mob LOS and make them run to melee, then AOE dps them down all at once. Room after room. Then there are spots that doesn't work and its Sprint sprint sprint. The design was such players learned quickly how to circumvent mechanics. It became mostly elitist speed runs where if you beat CoF in 6 mins, and you made them take 30 seconds longer you were auto kicked and replaced.
---
At this point they should cannibalize the dungeons leaving only the story mode in the world and condense the remaining paths to fractals. 
---
I would love to see them come back and do actually good dungeons. Guild Wars had some of the best.
---
&gt; It's not publicly available.
---
but other tools are! If they would allow this tool then their stance would either be to allow the use of any camera hack tools or favourite certain streamers. Just think about the posts of people getting banned because of using a camera hack tool while a well-known twitch streamer is not getting banned. This is favouritism.
---
Now, having a different camera operation is a different thing but that still doesn't change the fact that this tool isn't ToS compliant. In that case, it doesn't matter how other games do it. However, what could be done is to add a spectator mode for those things and events but that is also a different topic.
---
I haven't been playing actively since PoF release. I mainly just logged in to unlock the story episodes. I'm curious as to what people are doing PVE wise. Before my schedule got chaotic and my interest faded I was actively doing octovine and daily fractals. Octovine seems to have been fixed and there seems to be new fractals. I heard something about champion farming and a new farming location.
---
My favorite parts of GW1 collector's editions are still art books. I would really like to get a new physical copy of GW2 art
---
Ikr, but at least he didn't write "ASURANS" \^\^'
---
Glorious armor or any of the pvp achievements that are based on matches played on certain classes.
---
the links on that post take me to a not found page!
---
Wiki has a page on them for "[Suspicious Traveler](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Suspicious_Traveler)"
---
First mechnanics are in wrong raids (e.g. Glenna from W3 is at the end of W2).
---
We must not be playing the same game. I find myself with much to do, too much almost.
---
WvW has seen the Warclaw, reward tracks, various small events like no downed state week. While not enough I agree, it isn't nothing.
---
PvP has had new skins, and what looks like the start of a new 2v2 game mode. Balance is subjective so I won't bother going into it. 
---
PvE gets a new map, tons of achievements, new weapon sets or armor sets, new story, and more every 3 months. There is plenty to do. 
---
We just got 2 fractals reworked, but I agree Anet is behind on raids.
---
The newest living world map is a meta and gives a good chance at ascended weapons. How is that not replayable content? These maps aren't empty either.  
---
Just because you don't like the PvE content does not mean there is none.
---
[Champion rush event](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion_Rush) that is ending in less than 12 hours now is what people were talking about. In terms of events and farming people used to do Istan meta more before it got nerfed (Season 4 episode 1) but have moved on to Dragonfall now (Season 4 episode 6) for it's meta event and the good rewards it gives. People still run fractals and there have been several balance patches, new fractals, and instability changes since you last played. Lots of end game PvE is raids too with a couple new wings.
---
Could you provide more details or a link please?
---
Are you serious? I looked at your chart and there is a huge spike in gem store mount skins and outfits in late 2017/2018 which is basically what everyone has been complaining about. 
---
One of the top responses to your thread is 
---
&gt; I'm sorry but the simple fact that are zero in-game mount skins to earn is just bad and a bit sleazy. And there are what? 3 glider skins? All tied to the legendary back pieces.
---
And your response is "I think its fine you can just spend gold lol". Makes perfect sense.
---
In that case, I'm leaning toward a melee ranger over Minion NEcro, mostly because I'm looking something more skill based.
---
This is pretty much the bigges BS I had to read for weeks. Thanks for that.  
---
" Caring about the tos at this point is just whiteknighting".... soooo Im allowed to use bots for farm, and hacks in PvP? Good to know!  
---
And "the game is dying" or "Anet's house is burning down" are statements that are arround for years. Yet here we are, 7 years later.
---
&gt; I haven't been playing actively since PoF release...  what people are doing PVE wise 
---
Well they fixed the rewards of some of the map metas, so they aren't as bad. You get a guaranteed amalgamated gemstone along with other stuff. 
---
&gt;  new fractals 
---
So assuming you stopped *right* when PoF got released, they released 3 fractals; [Twilight Oasis](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Twilight_Oasis_Fractal), [Deepstone](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deepstone_Fractal), and [Siren's Reef](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Siren%27s_Reef_Fractal). 
---
The champ farming is part of an [ongoing event](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion_Rush) that ends on August 27th at 9AM PST. The new farming location is a new map that came out with LS4 EP 6, [Dragonfall](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragonfall).
---
I think "MOTHER" is the hint.
---
Or was it Martha?
---
Yep the great guild wars 2 community in action.
---
You better prepare yourself then. I hope you're right and that there is something juicy in the up coming announcement but anet has a track record of not delivering.
---
Very possible. That moment certainly stands out as a strange moment in the final episode. 
---
We'll have to wait an see if that has anything directly to do with the storyline. Otherwise, it could just be a hint at the larger cosmos and a further attempt to humanize and have us sympathize with the dragons.
---
everything could be worked on, but they simply have dropped doing so some time ago in favour of fractals for the 5-man PvE type of content in this game.
---
Cast bars are also something I miss from GW1. You could mouse over the skill being cast and see what it did. You could also tell what the enemy was doing even if there was heavy visual clutter on the screen at the moment.
---
&gt;No for dedicated solo mode for raids.
---
Why?
---
This is the reason I left Rift. I didn't want to raid, period.
---
Let's use weird shit to market the game and ban people on twitch for memes. 
---
##Marketing
---
I don´t think forcing the players to do raids for the story is a good idea, they already removed arah story so that it can be done solo and remember the outcry with raid exclusiv story for the white mantle?
---
&gt;If you're starting as a Ranger, you'll have an opportunity to select your starting pet. Since you want something that can get in there and tank for you, select Bear, Fern Hound, or Drake because they have the highest Toughness so they can take more abuse.
---
I'm about to open a Salvari option, and you mentioned I should pick Fern Hound. I check the list of pets I can get as starting pets and I'm not sure why to prefer Fern Hound over Moa? Moa is of type "Stout", which has +200 toughness bonus compared to the 'Support' type Fern Hound that only gets Vitality bonus?
---
That being said, it seems that at level 80, the Fern has more total Thoughness than the Moa?
---
But isn't that the whole point? Raids aren't getting enough people and the spend on raids matches that. The only way to get more investment in the content is to bring it to a wider audience. Forced grouping hasn't taken off in GW2. Yet, if you look at Tequati and the 3 worms, there are plenty of people that want a bit of adventure.
---
The moment you have a raid type of environment, it requires time investment. I can't play for 30 minutes and then run off to sort out my kids. I need to commit to the full 3 hours or whatever the raid duration is. That's where things start to fall apart. A lot of people are also scared to be called out for making a mistake. The very things that make raids interesting as serious group content are the ones that limit it's growth. That's why you need to think of the raid content reuse as different content.
---
because fractals replaced them
---
We won't miss youe as well
---
pretty sure that borealis was aurene's doing
---
The game is less than it should be, most maps are not worth playing and the big potential is unused. The lfg tool is a mess, and bringing more people to use it for lesser desired content is a bad idea.
---
Dog, if you think a camera hack that enables a pvp spectator mode in raids for a stream is equivalent to botting or hacking in pvp, you're a lost cause
---
It's not going to be great, but you will be able to play just fine if you adjust settings accordingly. Playability depends a lot on your in-game graphics settings. I've played on less.
---
My opinion is that 10 man raiding was a mistake, but it's too late for a change.
---
Making raids solo instances fixes nothing. It would be just another LW instance. It won't make people unwilling to raid trying them more. They would just complete the solo mode and leave.
---
I think the game shouldn't be looking for more ways to avoid grouping. The game should do the opposite - make people want to play with each other through group content.
---
Most people will complain that LFG is empty instead of making their own group. Dungeons are best example of it.
---
Yeah you guys gotta do it to fill the void of veteran commanders leaving, for open world, raids and WvW.
---
&gt; Then they just stopped adding levels to fractals after 100.
---
True, but they did add new fractals, just reducing the 'redundancy' within the 100. I consider this to be a good choice.
---
&gt; basically abandoned raid development
---
&gt; with The Key of Ahdashim being just 2 months open, I wonder if you might have missed something.
---
It's not just my opinion. Everyone in my guild who has played FB as an off-healer in raids has been super underwhelmed compared to the alternatives. The only fights where we find it to pull its weight are Adina and Trio (not that you'd swap healers for Trio). Outside that, we only run it if we need quickness + healing to make the comp work based on what the people on hand can play. It's fine enough to just stand there as an off healer and give boons, but it doesn't have the tools to recover a fight that goes off-script (at which point just go DPS Quickbrand if you need the boons).
---
Renegade and Scrapper have a higher skill floor but they blow FB out of the water if played well. The Ventari tablet heal can be charged as it moves making it a very consistent way to heal people out of the group, and Soulcleave + Breakrazor is straight cheatcodes for your sub. A few weeks ago I brute force healed a casual/meme KC pull on pushing tank heal Scrapper through red spawns like it was nothing because Scrapper's sustained healing output is bonkers. I'm not just hating on FB for no reason because I have a strange vendetta. I've personally run all of this stuff *many times* and FB falls short unless you need the boon profile.
---
Again, great in fractals because the environment is different.
---
While this is really interesting to see, don't hold your breath to wait for an announcement on the 30. Whatever this will lead to won't be announced in the next year's. If they're hiring for these positions they're not going to have a game ready to show.
---
Well, by tuning a blind eye on the fact that they were streaming and using hacks, it's already bending the rules and a huge favour.
---
Not anymore, guild influence isn't really used in guilds.  They use favors now after an update happened
---
You can do this with any class, SB is probably the best DPS dungeon class and you want a thief in most dungeons. Also there was no DH when dungeons were abandonned.
---
Devs and coders moved on, and Dungeons are built on ancient coding. They touch it = high chance to fck something up that will be hard to fix.
---
The issue is, gw2 is a swarm game. Patch hits, people swarm it for weeks or months, then go back to their regular stuff. People need reason to go back to maps. If they already completed their achievements, why should they go back to old content?
---
This is design issue, but it's been there for so long it will be hard to make a change, without offering ridiculous farms in every map.
---
Those requirements are easily things you can get done in not to much time (get decent gear, learn one or two viable builds (all classes are pretty much useable and accepted), put a bit of time aside). It is true however that with the non-existing support of Anet the raid community is falling apart and it is getting harder to find groups/guilds.
---
ANET doing some desperate shit damage control there xD
---
My argument is about increasing the number of people playing the raid content, not increasing the number of raiders. It's about stimulating investment in the raid content. That will probably drive more players to serious raids but that's more of a side effect.
---
Put it this way. Let's pretend that there was some pseudo raid content for solo players that was released along side all raids. If the content is tuned and rewarded correctly then people will play that content. You are now in a situation where it makes sense for A/Net to release a raid every few months because the investment that they make in the raid is used by a large portion of the player base. It doesn't matter if the same 5k players (crazy thumb suck) are still the only ones raiding. They will still build the content because another 150k players are playing the solo version.
---
I think he just means that more content is inherently repeatable down the line.
---
What tiny fraction of repeatable content we get in GW2 has crazy longevity. They were still running raid wings 1-3 in ERP3 last weekend because while the game has evolved since then, it's still reasonable content. (There were even some wipes in those wings!) The problem is that outside raids and fractals ANet doesn't really release anything worth repeating other than mindless open world gold farms. You have to be motivated to go back to old living story maps for collections, but that's not really the same form of engaging content.
---
I'm not so familiar with FFXIV, but my understanding is that they release a lot more instanced content designed to be repeated. I believe they also have some pretty generalized PvE instance matchmaking which, combined with bonus rewards for helping people through content when it's their first time, means that there's more old content to run, it's easier to get a party for old content, and you're more likely to randomly end up playing old content when you go looking.
---
Someone is free to come along and correct me, but my understanding is essentially that while GW2 was making a bunch of giant one-off open world maps FFXIV was creating proper instanced content worth replaying.
---
&gt; as it is mostly used to avoid fights you dont want to take, which is kinda the point of WvW, fighting?
---
No, it isn't. People play WvW for a variety of reasons. And being ganked by Roamers is not it for the vast majority of players. And that's what Roaming boils down to most of the time. Ganking players who stand no chance because you outnumber them or have much better equipment for small scale fights.
---
On the other hand, the Warclaw improved on one of the biggest hurdles for new players. Running to the Zerg after being killed. And making that travel safer.
---
&gt; but looking at updates i can see why veteran players are upset.
---
There really isn't all that much they could update. A new map is an option, although considering how the WvW community reacted to the desert borderlands. It took until now for them to at least somewhat accept a new map.
---
The only thing I can see they, where they actually might be able to do something is by shaking up the Meta more actively. Balance more heavy handed. Although that comes with its own drawbacks since most people just play one class. And if that one falls out of the Meta, they won't like that one bit.
---
I'm ok with replacing fractals within 75-100 range with more unique once. It's just that the new added fractals are boring timegates without CMs without any cool bosses etc. They are just a spamfest of aoe.
---
For the W7. Let's look at the release cadence:
---
W1: 17.11.2015
---
W2: 8.3.2016, 4 months after W1 
---
W3: 14.6.2016, 3 months after W2
---
W4: 8.2.2017 , 8 months after W3
---
W5: 28.11.2017, 9 months after W4
---
W6: 18.9.2018, 10 months(!) after W5
---
W7: 11.6.2019,  9 months after W6
---
The cadence has doubled/tripled from what it initially was and the difficulty has dropped significantly after W5. When you have nothing new to do in raids for almost a year between raid wings and new raids are cleared in 2 days (including CMs without no incentive to ever do CMs again) this counts as abandonment.
---
They do have this bullet in a few:
---
"Duties: Design systems that function well on a console"
---
" Experience: Previously shipped on a console"
---
It is hacking. And it is rather moronic to claim otherwise. It might not be as malicious as some other hacks. But it is literally hacking. By every definition of the word.
---
Pretty bold assumption. I don't think we will ever see serious resources dedicated for raid content.
---
I am in a guild that used to raid. They had weekly raid training runs. I can assure you, me not playing had everything to do with required time commitment and nothing to do with A/Net's support or lack thereof for raids. The guild started off doing AB runs and started raiding after that was nerfed. They were maxed out with players during the AB runs and only a handful of players log on daily now.
---
Physical or digital-only?
---
Absolutely. I'm not sure if Anet could have done much more to support the event. Interestingly, I got in touch with support to ask if there had been a relaxation on the rules surrounding memory reading tools to allow this to happen.
---
This was from an entirely selfish perspective - one of the major issues with roleplay in GW2 is that we don't have roleplay addons. The big hindrance for this isn't an overlay or grabbing information from an external location as far as I know (TACO does this fine, as did Overwolf) but, from my understanding, it is that standard API data can't determine which player is being targeted in game.
---
This is something that BGDM was able to do, against the ToS, with the gear checker so I was wondering if policy had perhaps changed. I want my TotalRP equivalent in Guild Wars 2 after all. 
---
I was told that support couldn't comment on this situation, that there had been no changes recently to the terms regarding third party tools and instead I should make a post on the forums. There was the usual line about reporting exploits in game, something that I didn't do and wasn't interested in. 
---
I guess Anet made a one-off exception, a sort of looking the other way situation.
---
aighty, thanks for checking up on this!
---
&gt; Episodic gameplay, as a concept, might be fake news. We saw it not work with HL2, and we saw it almost kinda work at first but then not actually with GW2.
---
This is a silly statement in general, fake news and the episodic gameplay concept are two entirely different things. Moreover, just because it didn't work for some games like HL2, doesn't mean they don't work at all, given that there's examples out there like the Telltale games or Life is Strange where they worked quite successfully.
---
As for GW2's case, its actually the other way around. At first, in LS1&amp;2 there was the biweekly updates with tiny amount of contents which didn't work out, which is why it changed from LS3 onwards. Given that the game is still releasing new content in that same way, it most definitely is working for the results Anet wants to achieve, else they wouldn't be doing it in this manner anymore.
---
There definitely won't be any dedicated investment with the current player base because of it's size. The only way that there will be investment is to reuse the investment in some other way. A/Net battles to churn out content for the players. Content takes time and investment. A raid, even solo raid, is something that can be repeated which makes it lucrative content and that's something that GW2 desperately needs.
---
a lot of the times when I am playing i am going back and forth into the kitchen to cook dinner for my family, in and out of other rooms doing random chores. not everyone can dedicate their time to everyone.
---
You have no evidence that the mechanics would have "been developed a anyway". However, as you state, encounters go through many interactions but you seem to apply this only to more difficult variants? Why? If you want to argue this point, you need a robust reason as to why easier variants (that have less additional models and programing) wouldn't ever be designed.
---
This is your balance argument too, so I am not going to address that further.
---
I have already provided arguments as to why an easy mode is beneficial. You can choose to read them, or continue arguing in bad faith from a viewpoint you clearly don't want to change, even when given other things to consider. If you want to continue as such, this conversation is over.
---
Of course this is point of playing MMO...
---
but as it does not give 50g/hour, who will join just for fun? Oh wait...
---
This is what I call awesome gameplay :D /s
---
&gt;17k is huge when you consider that all of GW2 usually gets 300-500 viewers on Twitch.
---
Not really, GW2 just isn't a Twitch-heavy game, and only people who watch Twitch a lot care about that. Getting a large number of views on Twitch is better than nothing, but in the grand scheme of things it's not a big deal for the game as a whole.
---
&gt; Ultimately it's about us wanting a change in how low they value the raid community.
---
Then be more people.
---
Its perspective. From mine we have been relaxing back waiting for something substantial to be announced for 2 years now. LS every 3 or 4 months for 2-4 years is not going to cut it. I WvW in between to fill the space. We all know how thats working out.
---
Pretty sure it's a taco marker
---
If that were the plot of a mobile game, it'd make a hell of a lot more sense after the Kralkatorrik Mists shit. Since it'd no doubt be another "heroes collection" game if it were a mobile game, placing it in the Mists where all times and places mingle is just ideal scenario, and what better than "Elder Dragon wrecked shit in the Mists, now mobile game is for repairing it" while the main game goes on to focus on Tyrian plots.
---
*community, you see someone cutting the line, you will remember and you damn well know that fucker wont make it to your dungeon groups
---
\^this
---
It's your own placed taco marker; go over it and press - (minus) and it should be removed. You can add them with + (plus) if i remember correctly.
---
OP I commend you for trying to do something good but as you've seen from these comments the community is doing more damage to the game than anything else. The salt is flowing and even if Anet deliver 10 expansions full of content nothing will quell the salt of the players here.
---
I was creating a squad to farm Jahai chests the other day and suddenly this amber diamond appeared. Hasn't vanished ever since. It is not visible on screen shots, only on screen capture. Got a similar thing in Thunderhead keeps where I lead a meta squad the other day.
---
Does anyone know what this, why it appears and if it vanishes again? TIA
---
Yeah taco marker. You can place it by hitting + button on your keyboard and remove by pressing - button
---
&gt;No. Gw2 still looks nice in my opinion, but it is very dated with current gen consoles visuals. There isn't much point releasing with the current engine, I can't see it attracting enough new players for it to be worth it.
---
I'm not so sure about that. It sorta worked out for STO and that game has an even worse engine in terms of out-datedness. And GW2 is one of the few MMOs that would work perfectly fine with console controls.
---
I remember getting downvoted heavily in another thread for saying, that almost everyone is toxic these days (me included)
---
Perhaps so, but as populations shift, developer attention has to shift with it. They've tried to bump up the PvP and raid crowds repeatedly, many would say foolishly, but at some point you need to cut bait. The audience is just not there to support those modes to the level that would justify the amount of attention those communities demand.
---
Youre not glass cannon at all. The class has extreme surviving capabilities through heals and blocks while also having some quickness from elite if your pug is xd, can do a lot of cc through PI and so on. I would say dgh is the class with the highest surviving capabilities and utility and the only way you will die is if you kill yourself on retal
---
That was maybe the case when realms were smaller and you had to have a good reputation but these times are over if they don´t go in your group the find another one
---
It is difference between MMO design and singleplayer design.
---
Just think about it, how often you play alongside with other people here. Basically every event ever.
---
They had two or more projects in the work that wasn't GW1/GW2 related. NCSoft CEOs and Shareholders wanted profits now, so they forced all studios under NCSoft West to cancel all in-development projects, including these two+ projects, and forced layoffs (in Anet's case, iirc it was 144 people).
---
One of the two+ projects was leaked by a concept artist to be a mobile game (showcased an un-stated mobile game art on his artiststation, but art included Inquest icon; the art was subsequently taken down after reddit thread opened on it).
---
**If** the game had enough work put into it to be close to release, **and** NCSoft gave the okay to finish it and release, then I could see it being the announcement. But I kind of find the latter unlikely so soon.
---
Nope, I am not confusing anything. “Just consume, don't criticize“.
---
Telling people to leave the game is one of the worst things you can say to a player.
---
That's true, but why would they specifically ask for experience shipping console games?
---
&gt; It's more that gw2 is such an old game it isn't replenishing new nor veteran players anymore
---
Gw2 being old is a weak argument when ESO and FF14 which are about just as old are getting more popular every year, while GW2 is getting less popular.
---
And the charr have a perfect hairstyle for this...
---
It made sense even afterwards. Aoe mechanics could simply be projectile shielder and reflected and extra spawns needed to run into the burn pile.
---
WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME?!?
---
Not always. If what they're pushing for is something that would fundamentally harm the game for the majority of players, then it's better for them to leave than it is for them to get their binky. If they're happy with the game, great. If they have reasonable suggestions that would cause more good than harm, also great. But if they're advocating that more time and attention be put into niche elements of the game, to the detriment of the content the majority of players engage in, then maybe they just picked the wrong game and would be happier elsewhere.
---
Just heads up, some of the images are out of place a bit. For example bandit trio has matthias mechanic and matthias has Glenna in to be protected (that would be lol btw). MO has samarog CC phase etc.
---
Geez, even Twitch has dramas?
---
it’s code 58:11:5:535:101 now ;-;
---
I mean at launch, 500 dungeon tokens meant something. I remember casuals buying carries through Arah the same way they buy carries through raids now.
---
Explain to me how anet releasing more raids fundamentally harms the majority of players.
---
sure. basically how much do you talk with those people ? nearly never . basicaly they are just bot.
---
&gt; most part rehashed. Dungeons are mostly just a long path with widened boss areas; Raids and Trials are rectangles with boss flying or walking around. The content is built on templates you can just reskin. World maps are quite literally barren of replayability. The combat system lacks the depth of GW2 and so stuff is easier to balance.
---
Excuse moi? Have you even played the game? The boss encounter design is a lot more varied and better designed than Guild Wars 2's, absolutely consistently. You only need to look at fights like Tsukuyomo to get more indepth mechanics than anything GW2 ever delivered.
---
&gt; easy cheesy.
---
there weren't easy on release though. A lot of players complained about the difficulty of Dungeons so they nerfed them. That and increasing power creep today is why they are so easy.
---
The name and acronym of the tournament was no doubt chosen as a joke by its creators.
---
&gt;people not knowing one tactic and you just fail over and over, even when its not your damn fault. 
---
So you want other experiences players to potentially put up with your lack of experience but can't be bothered with learning the ropes with a couple of players only slightly below your experience? I'm sorry, but you seem pretty damm toxic.
---
I only got level 80 like a month ago and I've assisted 2 raid trainings, we didn't get a clear but we've stuck with the same 5-6 players who don't have a clue and the rest from a guild that help us out. There are no excuses, I'm sorry.
---
nobody got time for this.
---
it's a game . if i wanted to stay in queue i'd be to the post office.
---
nice comunity move. shitty old game. and it's just the beginning.
---
Play alongside others? That looks more like queuing alongside others.
---
Oh, the sweet, sweet realisation of what vanilla WoW was like from people that never played it is going to be fun to follow.
---
Encouraging cooperative play is what Anet should do. 
---
The issue is one team member fucking up a mechanic can wipe a squad. E.g. the hand kiter during Deimos. Instead of wiping it should just being more difficult for them. Carrying team members should be possible in every instance. Like it was in gw1. This would reduce toxicity and encourage more players to join.
---
Only in this subreddit you would criticize an mmo over having to communicate with other players.
---
Alongside as in GW2.
---
Also, gold farms don't exist. All the big farms of the game have given *items* in the form of mats and gear. This is then exchanged for gold on the TP, *removing* gold from the economy via taxes.
---
All the content that gives raw gold is time gated (raids, daily, etc) or at least a much lower g/h than material farms.
---
This is classic though. And there are not crossrealm groups. So if you got a Bad repuatation you are fucked
---
And it was fun. Speed clearing and selling dungeons was the most fun I had in the game but the casual player base couldn't handle it so they did what they always do. Complain just like the HoT elite specs and now with raiding, its stupid and petty.
---
Agreed. A digital art book is just a bunch of jpegs.
---
“You need a little bit of rain to have a little bit of rainbow.“ -xQc
---
Judging by the screenshot, a lotta people got time for this.
---
That's the biggest difference between WoW and GW2. People can actually get busy for more than a week or two after a bigger release.
---
200-300€ per month
---
Whether it is too much realistically depends on your personal principles and your current financial situation - not on other players. 
---
That said, I've certainly spent more than you on average. Some months, I've spent 150$ and moźre.
---
Averaged over 7 years? Like 5 bucks, probably.
---
Standing in a queue is communication now?
---
As others have said it's a personal taco marker. I didn't know about them for the longest time, but they are super helpful if you are tagging up for things that have complicated routes. One of the things I use them for is HoT HP trains. There are premade routes for that but I'll use the markers for "short cuts" in the route or to mark more efficient spots for Mesmer portals.
---
Communication is optional in gw2.
---
Okay? 
---
You're acting like the game doesn't encourage solo play or something. 
---
You can literally do almost everything that isn't instanced content without having to interact with a single person. 
---
That's obviously a bad thing if it's in the MMO genre, but you can't deny that Anet is at fault for doing this.
---
Just wait for people to start streaming Molten Core. It was referred to as Molten Bore for a reason. Copy and pasted bosses with one or two mechanics, here we go!
---
You know, with the modern balance, you can still get through most content by throwing more guardians at it.
---
And **Boxing Gloves.**
---
They still lurk in my bank for the day I can put them in my novelties.
---
The community who made this game visible with 17k views. Try to think before posting.
---
still is optional .
---
It was terrible design though, plain and simple.
---
Playing the content the way it was intended, was overly difficult because of class design. Playing the content the way the players figured out how to play it, was trivializing the content.
---
Fractals are a much better design to fit within the structure of the combat and class design in GW2. Allowing pretty fluid party compositions as was always the intention of a non-holy trinity game.
---
Dungeons would actually work in today's GW2 though, because the tank and heal roles are more clearly defined now (thanks to raid content). But I doubt its a direction Anet would have any interest in going to. Fractals are easier to design, quicker to design, more accessible to players, less time demand on the players, infinitely scaleable and as mentioned less strict on party comp.
---
oh hey wasted all the night in queue to log the server ... this is cool cause it's the first time. let them do this for a week and you'll see if they "have time "
---
I'd hardly call skins as content and achievements can be done within a week of casual play. Not to mention that 3 months are unrealistic. Most of latest releases were on 4-5 month schedule.
---
Reward tracks dont have any value on keeping players in the game mode or game at all, neither do bad skins (or any skins).
---
The only thing I can agree on are the fractal reworks and Dragonfall. DF is without doubt the best map that we've seen since HoT and it might as well be the best map in general. The problem is that none of the older LS episodes (not just maps, whole episodes) come even close to the latest one in amount of replayable content, features from other maps (HoT masteries), collections (good armor skins, skyscale, ascended weapons) and just general map meta mechanic.
---
holy shit that is freaking lot
---
lol no.
---
What op is trying to say, is that despite there being tons of people around in gw2, it really feels like you're just playing "alongside" them and not "with" them. Classic wow really does feel like the people out in the world have an impact on you and the world, where in gw2, they really don't.
---
I use to spend around 10 per month but its been a year now and I have spent almost nothing because I haven't been really happy with the state of the game and the gemstore prices / quality items...
---
That's nothing compared to the whales
---
You dont consider yourself a whale, when spending 200-300€ per month?
---
LOL no! I'm a small dolphin. Whales spent several thousand dollars each month
---
Did you build the arena at the bottom too? Or just the pavilion?
---
you guys also forget that the gold nerf to dungeons was also because Anet wanted to push the newly introduced raids.
---
MANY MANY people back then still enjoyed dungeons, and did dungeons on a daily basis, or only did dungeons exclusively.
---
Since Anet couldnt find a way to balance both dungeons and raids, and fearing people wouldnt embrace raids wholeheartedly, they tried to cut the profits out of dungeons in an attempt to forcefully push people out of it and towards raids.
---
that did have an effect, but not the effect Anet assumed it would have. 
---
instead MANY MANY people actually just upped and left the game entirely because of the nerf. Anet underestimated just how many people actually loved doing dungeons.
---
The official excuse was of course that they thought dungeon rewards were too rewarding (which no one never really believed).
---
funny thing some time later they actually reintroduced gold rewards, and even made it slightly better (introduced the dungeon frequenter repeatable achiev for example)  but the damage had allready been done and dungeons never were the same again.
---
&gt; You have no evidence that the mechanics would have "been developed a anyway". However, as you state, encounters go through many interactions but you seem to apply this only to more difficult variants? Why?
---
I have no evidence, but I have plenty of experience. It's your choice to believe it or not, but I've given you a solid reason why it happens the way I described.
---
As to "why", the obvious answer is "because ANet game designers didn't deem easier variants necessary". It might be because raids are supposed to be challenging content and "easy challenging content" is sort of oxymoron. Or it might be because they thought the other instanced content the game already offers is sufficient as a stepping stone into raiding. I really couldn't know their exact thoughts, however the end results speak for themselves. It is worth noting they apparently didn't originally deem harder variants necessary as well.
---
Now about your arguments:
---
1. More people fractured along more difficulties. What do you reckon the chances are for the actual number of players at any given difficulty to actually drop? And please don't refer games with gear treadmills as arguments toward multiple difficulties. It is obvious why that works there and why it is different in GW2.
---
2. See fractals. The amount of people playing below T4 is negligible. Last time I needed something out of low-level fractal for a collection I opted to solo it instead of waiting forever to fill a party. The sole reason for the existence of the lower tiers is the enforced gear (AR) progression. 
---
3. No it doesn't. The same way playing Nightmare and Shattered Observatory does not encourage (or prepare) people to play the CMs. 
---
*You cannot lure people into challenging content if they don't seek the challenge.*
---
This is why this transition does not occur. And once again, in can happen in other games because of the inherent power creep that happens along by acquiring more powerful gear.
---
4. Except it doesn't. See above. No amount of T4 Nightmare will make you ready for Nightmare CM. The only way to get experience in a challenging encounter is to play it and fail it, then play it and fail it more. This is the whole point of its existence. This is why hardcore players want to play it and it is precisely why casual players don't. It is not a question of having more difficulty levels, it's a question of having the mindset for it. And yet again, note how a gear progression changes this. 
---
5. And this is what happens with powercreep. Those who don't like *skill* progression eventually find themselves powercrept enough to beat an encounter without having to actually spend time figuring it out and mastering it.
---
6. The true sense of progression is the skill progression I mentioned. Face a boss, get demolished, figure out what happens, devise a plan to beat it, adapt it, execute it, beat the boss eventually. It is tremendously rewarding. But only when there's an actual challenge. Beating Shattered Observatory on normal is completing just another T4 daily. Beating it on CM for the first time is something else entirely. And you WILL go over the progression I talk about in order to do it. Even if you read a guide and copy the strategy, you'll still need the practice to nail down the mechanics, both individually and as a team. 
---
7. And what do they get of them? Loot?
---
I quit this game two times, came back once (for 2 weeks lol). Most people I know didn't comeback to this game (but I was primarly interested in WvW/raids). Look at BDO: game has patches every week, you can expect big changes to any system every month, new content is on point. You can hate their monetization but that doesnt change pearl abyss is on point with content and people don't cry to devs for more. But GW2 is so casual people are ok with 5-6 hours of content per 3-4 months and questionable balance changes.
---
Gw2 on consoles?
---
Not sure how long. Just on and off between work the past few days. Hard to say really. It's "bigger" in GW2 but I usually play that zoomed out from my character so it doesn't feel quite so huge
---
Literally every single comment you make is being negative about something. In case you missed it, you are the toxic negative guy who you seem to be fighting on reddit.
---
Zero. I don't care about skins or cosmetic items. I have nothing really I would even use from the gemstore.
---
I do get character slots every now and again, but since I don't have much use for gold I can just convert it to gems.
---
&gt; Create a way to practice the raids solo. I can run into a raid and die in a few seconds trying to solo a boss or run into an instance and practice against the golem. Neither of those two things help in a raid. You aren't alive long enough to figure out what is going on with the raid boss and the golem is only helping you to build your DPS in an artificial situation. The alternative is to try and find 3-4 hours and a raid intro group. Yeah, I know that raiding is supposed to be with a group of people but you never know, maybe some of the practice graduates might join real raids after they earn their stripes. Let people earn an achievement for the practice raids. 
---
I'm not sure how this opinion can even exist.
---
By far the best option to practise raids is - who would've thought -  to join a training guild. There you get explanation for the encounter and have a better understanding of the bosses than the average pug afterjust a few tries. Especially if you're working the training at fixed times is so much better for your schedule than camping the LFG and hoping that someone puts up a training there.
---
Also the practise golem helps you A LOT. Muscle memory is so important because you can focus on the actual mechanics of the raids instead of your rotation. 
---
Solo mode for raids would not help for learning raids because it has to be so easy that most of the mechanics don't matter at all. You're better of just reading a guide tbh.
---
However I'm all for multiple difficulties like easy mode (just call it story mode and remove enrage timer and reduce the dmg taken, all oneshot attacks now just put you in downstate something like that with slightly reduced rewards), normal mode and repeatable cms. Would increase the potential playerbase for raids massively while also increasing accessability and some people will probably stick and try at least normal mode. The whole "we do not want to split the community"-meme is just another thing that is killing the raid community.
---
Haven't touched WoW - what we are looking at here?
---
ty :)
---
&gt;A 5-man group is a lot easier to assemble than a 10-man group. 
---
true that
---
&gt;Fractals do not require that much time in one block.
---
if you pug fractals (CMs+T4) that will take longer than a single raid Wing
---
&gt;And even in T4 fractals, I still have the feeling that every profession is accepted
---
Even in T4 that seems a rare case if you do CMs as well then definitely no. At least on EU
---
&gt;Not so much in raids, where everything seems to assemble around "the current best way to play this wing"
---
Almost no one pugging plays the best way to do a raid. Most still run with 2 Chronos even..... You have  way better chances to play all your classes in a raid than in a fractal
---
And yes you got to have to invest some time to get into doing PvE endgame content and if you can't take the time to have a 3h training run for a few times till you can start pugging, maybe raiding just isn't for you.  
---
There are enough guilds out there offering training runs like once per day so you could even choose when you want to join to get your training, it's not like you have to commit to a certain time every week.
---
You got all the Options and are still here complaining that it is still to hard. Is it so hard to find 3h of free time only once?
---
If you don't have much use for gold, maybe you could support my little legendary project that's been going on for 2 months now!
---
WoW classic is WoW *classic*, who would have guessed. 
---
Don't like it, don't play it. Regular servers still exist.
---
Veterans, Devs and other Blizzard employers warned people what classic would be like and that many players have rose tinted glasses and a warped sense of classic. But players wanted it anyway so more power to them.
---
Would love to see this community's reaction to the initial weeks of HoT when masteries were required to get anywhere and mobs were much deadlier~~
---
You really think there isnt a better game that has frequent and intended content droughts that can last anywhere from 9 months - 2 years depending on the game mode?
---
Fake taxi, and "our time is now"
---
&gt; Actually that is close to half of an avarege Hunarian employee's monthly salary.
---
Then you should probably stop playing video games and start riots on the streets for better wages
---
First of all I don't consider it as having "lost" money to the gemstore. GW2 is one of my hobbies and it brings me joy, so I like spending some money here and there. That said, I think my average spendings on gems/month are around 25€. Some months, I spend a lot more than this (probably around 50-70€) &amp; some months, I spend 0€. Alltogether over the last 7 years, I probably spent ~ 2000€ on this game; which sounds like a lot but, stretched out to 7 years, equals ~ 23€/month. I think that's a fair amount to spend on a hobby. But I also understand people who don't want to spend real money on a game. To each their own :)
---
I'm pretty sure the developers that worked on it are long gone / assigned elsewhere and all that's left is spaghetti code.  They are the best concept of instanced content to me in the game because they are incredibly alt friendly compared to fractals which require Agony Resistance to do.  Since I like to play my many characters, they are perfect for me, a shame they got abandoned.  Too bad they'll never fix or add on to them anymore.
---
I keep hearing casual players say anet knows best and casual players are a majority. Been hearing that for years.
---
Then they suggest making content these players hate more casual friendly, which has been attempted to some extent for pvp, wvw and fractals, and generally did not lead to any success. In fact it further alienates both groups. See warclaw, desert bl, several pvp leaderboard designs, reward structures, easymode raids, fractal restructure, ...
---
By all means, keep demanding other groups to cater to your playstyle unconditionally, while refusing to even acknowledge their criticism under the guise of "casual players are a majority and everything must be designed and catered to them". Then act surprised when your community is splintered, declining and bitter. 
---
Making raids solo friendly pleb content where you can queue up and play without interacting or cooperating with your allies wont alleviate these problems. I'd dare bet it will inflate raiders short term and simultaneously lose communities and players even more after the initial spike.

Appears to travel at the same speed, so it could be...

Yes that would instantly change half a decade of socialist inheritage. :D
---
Easy, no responsibilities, welcomed into groups, ... you've found the perfect game!
---
Goodluck finding groups!
---
Just to be clear, my comment was sarcasm.
---
I'm not sure if your comment is a counter argument to mine or you are backing me up.
---
&gt;\* Link is back up now. However, they want your full name, email and phone number :/
---
And? If you win, they'll also want your full address.
---
Probably something between 5-15 given I've barely bought anything since like 2017.
---
Wholesome ASF
---
it's just the good old day effect. just like when u play some retrogame .
---
It's also written in the blog post.
---
Realistically you don't own anything you bought through gem store.
---
Nice
---
That’s more a round 2-3 days’ pay for me, which isnt that much. I consider whales to be people spending more than $500 a month
---
I joined GW2 at release after playing WoW for years.  Shared participation and shared gathering nodes were the greatest things to me when I started playing, and I still think they are the better option.
---
You forgot street ads after PoF
---
Oh, I see now. Good to know, thanks for clearing it out!
---
["Reminds me of the new look of a central GW2 character whose name I can’t quite recall"](https://twitter.com/tomabernathy/status/1165731455101587456) 🤔
---
Wow thank you so much! I am surely going to read and check all of those links to try to situate myself.
---
Thank you once again!
---
Oh I preordered the printed version on amazon.
---
Well then, where is the banwave coming for people recording or streaming the game?
---
Can I ask you where did you get the statistics from? I'm just curious how you got "Almost guaranteed".
---
has Anet seen this :D &lt;3
---
Having 25 characters on my main account. It annoyed me so much.. i destroyed them all so far- i would love this feature

i'd imagine the bottom half would take 10x as long due to the arenas above the arena ;) nice job :D
---
I'm having two jobs right now and none of them is a blue-collar job. If I maximize my earnings in a month I get 1,000 $. From that spending a quarter to gems would be insanity. Of course, I buy 4-5 AAA games in a year and 2-3times some gem but that's it. And with this amount of salary I'm way above average in my home country.
---
they must have worked, if you remember them all!
---
Sorry but communities arent built and ran by casual players that take several months of gaps. 
---
These arent running guilds, groups, driving their content actively.
---
Anyone playing wvw remotely regularly will realise a decline in wvw comms as they quit, meaning less action, more queues, more dead servers and more difficulty to join organised groups casually.
---
Exact same for raids, both full clears, single bosses and training raids.
---
Same for regular community hosted maps and events, such as frequent TT runs. Many casual players join and rely on vets regularly hosting these events. But once these leave they're rarely replaced.
---
Hence the raid lfg being increasingly a ghost time. Wvw having eternal issues with pop movements because there are too many people that want to join in casually and too few to organise stuff.
---
Frankly the people without ties, that can come and go every few months without issues are replaceable by virtually anyone. Meanwhile if on a wvw server 2 public comms quit or leave they lose 80% of their pug groups, and typically a mass exodus of players to other servers follows.
---
&gt; Awful understanding of class balance. Warriors and Elementalists only. 
---
When I played there was at least one mesmer in team as well. Quickness was OP back then! (+100% cast speed)
---
Ooooh, now I'm interested. What's the tea?
---
No problem and welcome back! Feel free to ask me questions or give me feedback on the guide (it's still a work in progress but people asking for info motivates me to actually finish sections lol)
---
I really like that watch though, and FULLY expect to win it :-)
---
I wont notice the difference. Until you kick people from your party or squad for refusing to communicate, half the pugs in this game probably dont even have a keyboard plugged in.
---
Their combat is so bad it's probably just left clicking with their mouse, and they cant communicate whatsoever. Might as well be on a console.
---
Wasted money how? I seriously doubt a $300 new PC can come anywhere close to the gaming capability of a $300 console. If I don't need a PC, buying a PC for gaming would be unnecessary.
---
I fully agree. They'll keep the servers open even without development as long as possible for that sweet gemstore money.
---
Sure do! Thank you!
---
You did not do things in classic WoW, or even WotLK as a "community". MoP was better for the community feeling due to the rare spawn system that was introduced and the prominent and accessible world bosses. Timeless Isle was also really good for a community feeling, but that was a decade later than vanilla WoW.
---
You're a pretty dumb bandwagoner that is linked to his own old server and doesnt even realise it. 10/10 would read again.
---
Saw a different but similar screenshot in reddit depicting WoW classic queue. The comments were like "wholesome", "good mannered", "maturity" etc. While that's true, all I thought was  "I rather be playing the game". 
---
And that's why I play GW2. Coming from kill steal grind fest hell of Korean and Chinese MMOs, GW2 actually respects my time.
---
link?
---
I did but watching you spread toxicity towards everyone with criticism is pretty good entertainment, and since I'm not playing gw2 I've got time on my hands.

---
You cannont realisticaly compare these things between two diffrent countries. 
---
The rent I pay in my country per month (€300) is less that what a friend of mine pays per week in the UK (~€380)
---
Also, for example the poverty threshold (the minimun amount of money needed to cover basic needs) in Italy is something around €500, while in Switzerland it is around €2500.
---
Since the cost of living is so different between countries, the wages are also usually largely different to reflect that.
---
What do you spend that much money on? Like what do you buy? I never imagined people paying 100€/$ + on a monthly basis. Sounds crazy to me. I barely spent 20€ every 2-3 month and I still got everything. It’s not that I couldn’t afford spending 100€ but what would I spend it on?
---
I wish the hateboner for Anet and GW2 would be figurative as well, sadly we got way too many people who are in serious emotional turmoil because the computer game company on the internet doesn't love them back.
---
Ysoki?
---
NA is noticing the consequences of bullying your vets / more hardcore players out of the public scene.
---
Well? What are you waiting for? Kill him and take the loot!
---
That might be it, but i only got a chargeback for one of the charges. I don't remember exactly, but i think i did play a bit after the chargeback tho.
---
I mean you appear to be in a lot of emotional turmoil too when you post on this sub.
---
&gt; my characters kick-ass ancestor
---
I generally agree with your point, but 80% of GW2 races wouldn't have had a human ancestor,so it would be weird for them to have a shrine/monument to a human who lived hundreds of years ago. (With Ronan being an exception for sylvari.)
---
Never spent a cent in the gemstore since beta. But i did pay for all the expacs with enthusiasm. I don't mind dropping money for actual content.
---
Getting something back doesn't have to mean owning it. I go to a show, I see the show, I got something back, which in the case of a show is entertainment. I don't own the show. I don't keep the show except perhaps in my memory. I pay for the experience of the show.
---
I pay for a gym membership, but it can be terminated at any time. It's only access. Does that mean I'm paying for nothing because I don't own the gym?
---
anet's marketing team needs to be fired hard. why are they so bad at advertising
---
Too bad Nintendo is not famous for pushing some checkmarks pseudo agendas in order to pander to diversities and being bashed instead for being offensive to said diversities.
---
I've paid a lot of money to the gem store. I've paid a lot of money for a lot of hobbies. The money is ear-marked for entertainment. I've lost nothing, because I'd be spending it on something at some point, if not this game, another game, or another hobby.
---
Hi! I just read the [news that Microsoft will open up and make directX12 available for Windows 7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/porting-directx-12-games-to-windows-7/)!
---
Would you enable your d912pxy to be run on Windows 7, too? That would be AWESOME! I really want to try that out, too, and I guess many people also still run Win7.
---
what is this "clear distinction" between fractals and dungeons exactly?!!
---
They are very different and anet should have supported both.
---
Those GW2 Taxis around the launch were ... strange.
---
Never just charge back. You should have gone to support and let them send it back. Chargebacks basically blacklist you amongst payment companies, so it is not to be used when other means were possible.
---
ah, mixing those up all the time.
---
What we can expect moving forward:
---
• CM no longer has downstate
---
• ERP or by another name will be hosted yearly by Anet
---
It’s basically handled to them on a silver platter at this point.
---
There's a youtuber called Nike who has a video about the state the game is in and he said something along the lines of the majority of the original devs are no longer at anet so it's difficult for the current devs to maintain older game stuff.
---
Btw I don't remember dungeons failing in vanilla the lfg was always active.
---
They never talk about the future, but I'd like to know what their plans with the game are that do not involve story and open world.
---
I'm sorry, but if all you have is anecdotal evidence that doesn't hold up much. The onus is on you, as the one that is claiming easier difficulties are a massive problem, to justify that statement. You haven't done so.
---
To your points, in relation to what I said.
---
1. We already have this. We have stratification of groups along KP experience, doing CMs or not, speed clearing or not, being limited to easier bosses or being able to clear everything.
---
As an aside, unless you can substantiate why variable difficulties are not applicable to GW2 because of the lack of a gear treadmill, I'm going to struggle to take any of your points seriously and I'm not sure I want to put the effort into addressing any of your other comments as you don't substantiate things and just try to mindlessly discard arguments that show your stance to be incorrect.
---
This is especially true of your argument here which is beyond fallacious and completely devoid of any awareness. After all, do fractals not have variable difficulties? The same difficulties that work well to introduce players and also allow players to choose their own level of difficulty that they want to play at?
---
2. Ahh... Wait. You do go down the route of fractals, but decide to spin things in a completely awkward manner.
---
Have you ever been part of a casual guild? Helped out players? Taken a look at those LFGs, which are actually well populated and used?
---
I'd guess not.
---
3. Okay honey. This one and we're officially done because your points are beyond obtuse. You may as well pull up a table, grab a mug of your favourite hot drink and sit behind a banner saying "I don't want an easy mode and I don't care about your arguments. I won't change my mind."
---
To claim that SO and Nightmare do nothing to prepare players is beyond daft. Look at the design of Ensolyss on T1 to CM. Notice how mechanics are introduced and then made harder alongside new mechanics? Notice how that continues from T1 to T2 to T3 to T4 to CM? Complete with things gradually getting harder? Take a look at the Ensolyss 66% and 33% phases only if you haven't recognised this yet. 
---
That is absolutely preparing players and that you can't even recognise that let's me know not to bother with addressing the rest of your points.
---
I'm quite done now, have a good day!
---
It really isn't and your going to have to try harder than that.
---
In reality most of the time I don't even really know where that money went. 
---
Most of it goes to stuff like character slots, black lion keys or sometimes some novelty things. Sometimes seasonal stuff (as a huge fan of super adventure box I always get everything from the gem store that has to do with that) I also give gifts to friends sometimes and of course I purchase some outfits and so on.
---
I don't always spend all of the gems I get and wait for something more interesting.
---
Yeah I can definitely see the excitement over there in Queue Simulator 2004.
---
True, but I don't think it would be too hard to resolve that with fluff. The GW1 pc was a hero to every race, and we don't know where they settled and who would be most inclined to keep their memory alive. Charr would be the only ones it would be tricky to write s narrative for, but even then the GW1PC basically championed the rebellion against the flame legion, leading the first anti-flame charr/human unit
---
Why would they keep supporting content for a "niche group," though, when it's more profitable to cater to a larger audience?
---
Guild Wars 2 has an entirely different server structure than WoW... Try again.
---
It's a bit sad that those beautiful things take so much time to make
---
&gt; If you spend the better part of 4 years shitting on raids, the raiding community and spread some of the dumbest rumors/lies, you probably shouldn't go all "Picachu meme" when raiders start hitting back.
---
So these fabled "casuals" are calling "raiders" toxic and then they are surprised when "raiders" behave in a toxic way? That doesn't even make sense. Why would they be "pikachu meme" if "raiders" are doing exactly what "casuals" said they were doing all along?
---
The same thing as everything else that's more obvious: going north, where there's an aurora visible.
---
And though I doubt Anet has this in mind, there is an old dialogue about Jormag and auroras, that they changed when Jormag rose.
---
Oh, the queues are definitely wholesome. But, in my experience playing WoW, they are quick to fall apart and from things to become a free for all mess.
---
This happens even in modern MMOs when developers try to put players through a choke point, particularly with an intractable or NPC that can only be talked to by one person.
---
It happened in the Pandaren starting zone in Mists of Pandaria, with garrison creation in Warlords of Draenor and I believe also in a recent expansion of FFXIV (not the most recent). Queues are what happens at first before it becomes a messy free for all.
---
A chargeback ends up costing the developer money. The situation sucks but you sadly only have yourself to blame for the suspension
---
Fractals are dungeons by a different name. They have lore/store differences (alternate realities as opposed to in-universe locations in the current reality) and they all have a common reward pool instead of unique ones with each addition (I've personally criticised this in the past) and they focus on three "paths" a day instead of user choice like dungeons (which boiled down to the same fastest paths each day) but they are dungeons. If ArenaNet had never released the original dungeons and just released fractals at dungeons, everyone would be calling them dungeons.
---
Fractals definitely have their issues, but one of them isn't that they aren't dungeons. Instanced five player PvE content with trash mobs and bosses throughout is a dungeon.
---
Warrior often handles mechanics, together with boon/heal supports. I agree that it is low-maintenance and highly desirable. Then again, unless you fractal/raid it should be no issue.
---
I do miss the "stories" in the dungeons.
---
YOU HEARD KRAST.
---
GW2 was released a few months after WoW so it wasn't years.
---
Good design for the individual in early WoW? You are joking, right? Particularly with the joy of getting new guild members and then having to spend your individual time and resources getting them resist gear and similar.
---
I really think people either never played early WoW or haven't taken off those rose tinted glasses.
---
If i get an answer, i'll do.
---
If they dont reveal anything regarding GW3 can you please ask them since the game is getting old what are their long term plans for the franchise?
---
Ask why the unique selling point like wvw, pvp and raids wich are in gw2 a lot better and could be top notch compair to other games never get promoted, advertised or supported with the love they should be treated.. 
---
That this could be a major success even for the next year's and that ppl want it you could have seen last weekend (erp) 
---
I would love to hear an honest answer...
---
Are we blind?! Deploy the upvotes!
---
"Is this an out of season April Fool's joke?"
---
Regarding Raids and Fractals:
---
* What's the future of Raids and Fractals
---
* After the recent layoffs and internal restructuring, is there a Raid and Fractal team anymore?
---
* Are you going to improve the cadence at which raids and fractals are released.
---
* Are there going to be more Challenge Modes in future fractal releases.
---
I use this same punchline when people are looking for legendary spawns in SW.
---
"You're a legend, never doubt yourself."
---
I think that we will get answers during the reveal, but I would want to get revealed what "expansion tier features" we can expect during whole season 5. 
---
We got this roadmap in march -&gt; https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/
---
From that, we got already delivered runes and sigils, first half of build templates, we are getting cooking today. 
---
That offers question about how far those WvW updates are, swiss pvp system, jewelcrafting 500. Basically to build upon this roadmap, with actualized view and possibly with some more planned stuff as well? No need to get dates, as from above you can see they do deliver in reasonable developmnet time after they talk about it. But still, some basic idea on how far the progress is would be great to know.
---
And...details about new fractal, there possibly can be one within Season5 Epizode1 release, and we heard nor seen anything yet. Would be nice to get some sneak peeks.
---
I had no idea you could get a replacement! Brb, deleting all of mine!
---
Yeah, like the organic building-style of the sylvari or the asura and their very "diagonal" builds, etc.
---
Another funny thing is that GW2 uses forced perspective in a lot of places. For example in Divinity's Reach -&gt;use your mount to climb up the walls and you'll notice that the buildings that are higher up are all WAY too small. But by building them that way, it looks like the walls of the city are way higher when you're on the ground.
---
That other thread was already shown to be a mistake. The original post by the watch company has already been replaced: https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cvtwaz/so_uh_new_game_coming_out_huh/ey6dkdh/
---
The seventh anniversary question.
---
I paid 30€ back in '96 and am pissed that Anet puts stuff at the gemstore instead of in the game.
---
Snarky bullshit aside, I just checked kind of and it turns out I paid around 10€ a month over seven years. Maybe less. But pretty close to a regular sub, which is pretty funny.
---
Classic WoW had it's problems for sure.  But, for many of us those problems actually helped make a far stronger game.  Obviously that will depend on the people you have in any game.  Thankfully the ones I had in WoW were people I at the time gladly didn't mind spending the time to help.
---
In the end it's like I said in my other comment.  GW2 is seven years in and outside of a few specific memories, there is just nothing there that stands out enough to talk to my gaming friends with.  As recently as a few months ago though a few coworkers and I exchanged old school WoW (we all quit with the prepatch before MoP) memories fondly.
---
Different strokes for different folks.  The glasses don't have to be tinted though.  The problems are just worth it for many people.
---
Since lots of people are asking about physical vs digital, u/linuky found the physical copy on Amazon: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cvztzd/due_to_the_new_gw2_giveaway_by_anets_new_partner/ey7xfpe/
---
It had over a million viewers at twitch yesterday. "You think you do, but you don't" has been proven very wrong and the interest in classic shows it
---
I think there are/were enough people, I had no issues finding groups/guilds to raid with from around 2 to 3 years ago up to a year ago. but then the people I played with just started quitting the game after having done the available CM's knowing there wasn't going to be a new release in like atleast 6 months or so. I think up till wing 5 people still believed Anet could do raids justice, but after that the release schedule and difficulty of new releases was just disappointing with no improvement in sight.
---
I don't think easier content can save the community unless it is released at a significantly faster pace with actual hard fights as well. Maybe raids aren't worth it for Anet at all, but if they want to keep them I believe their best bet is to make them hard (at least as hard as they have been up to now which isn't that hard) so a community around them is required.
---
If you like asking uncomfortable questions, ask anything about competitive game modes. PvP and WvW didn't get any meaningful updates in years (no, Warclaw is not meaningful, quite the opposite), and there is hardly any or no info on the changes they promised looong time ago (Alliances for WvW, swiss for PvP).
---
* What is the point of releasing PvP maps if they won't be played (2v2 maps) ? Why are they advertised so much?
---
* Will long-lasting problems in WvW ever be adressed (break-ins into objectives, balance) ? 
---
* Are they aware meta builds and party composition in PvP and WvW is stale and unchanged ever since Path of Fire release (Firebrand+Scourge dominating) ?
---
And since you specifically asked for community-focused questions:
---
* Are they aware of shrinking player base in competetive game modes (especially NA PvP where you can predict the next set of players you will be playing with) ? Are they planning to adress that?
---
* Guilds? Are they planning on expanding guild content? It hasn't been updated ever since Heart of Thorns release. Outside a narrow piece of WvW, guilds became nothing more than a poorly implemented discord chat.
---
Ok np, why are people more excited to play a 18  year old game than waiting for Anet living story 5 announcement
---
Well, there is more excitement because:
---
* WoW was so many peoples' first MMO.
---
* And because WoW was the first MMO that most people ever heard of.
---
* And because WoW is so many peoples' **current** MMO.
---
* And because Blizzard has a huge advertising budget.
---
I'm not sure its because of the gameplay...mainly because of nostalgia.
---
Are there any plans to support some of the upcoming streaming services like stadia or xcloud?
---
If this topic won't come up during the presentation, then: 
---
What's the future of raids and fractals?
---
Can we expect more epic living world World Bosses, like the Marionette/Battle on the Breachmaker, that change the part of location for just the event time? 
---
How was preparing for the whole Special Event? I can see that a lot of effort has been made to make this event possible. Where there any odds to make it possible considering 2019 was one of the hardest years in Arenanet's history?
---
level 50 dungeons and istances in FFXIV are still quite fun, while dungeons in GW2 suffer from old, not fully fleshed game design.
---
Cos everyone knows that doing chargebacks is a MASSIVE no-no. Double charging happens very rarely but it does happen. (Even in Supermarkets) All you have to do is contact customer service
---
What else was i supposed to do? Got charged for 10€ twice. 20€ in total, only got a chargeback for 10€.
---
I would understand if i got a chargeback for both, but i only did for one...
---
It's all good for the raid community, they're motivated enough to jump through all the necessary hoops. But I think the point of contention here is that the raid community wants more content, but there aren't enough of them to justify taking developers off open world and gem store to create said content. You need to either convert non-raiders or attract new players, and that's where it becomes unrealistic to expect all of those people to take the same initiative.
---
I agree that difficulty levels are the way to go. Give the easy mode decent enough rewards to incentivize people to try it but less than normal mode to motivate them to move up the ranks. Question is whether it's too late already, with raiders leaving and raids being stigmatized to existing casuals
---
Just curious tho: did you finish quickly because you and / or others knew what to do? I wonder if a random group composed purely of people who hadn't done TA and hadn't ever done dungeons / fractals / raids (probably most players) would still do well?
---
I usually did such in party of two, it is very easy to not oneshot mobs and both get tag on them. Even in a way that one kites them and the partner finishes them. Usually the progress is done within 10% difference.
---
Yes, hopefully the player distribution in HoT vs PoF maps is showing ANet that HoT really was the better balanced content.
---
Do you plan to add further levels to fractals/ rework the tier system?
---
watching trainwrecks is also a thing. Just because people are watching, doesnt mean its good content.
---
Are there any plans to make Living World content more repeatable with, for example, a dungeon version of story instances.
---
Are there any plans for multiple difficulty tiers in any future content?
---
Enjoy the reveal!
---
This is ridiculous. I stopped playing GW2 a while back but I will never understand why anyone would play this outdated abomination. GW2 is better in every single possible way.
---
It gonna do that for me, if Anet give us real gamepad support for GW2 with this! :)
---
Sadly that's not an option, i reinstalled my pc multiple times since october.
---
Braham?
---
One Question I think they would be willing to answer is 
---
"With Elite Specs being brought more in line with basegame ones, will we be allowed to use elite weapons without their respective specialization?"
---
can I have your stuff, before you uninstall? :)
---
From the popular ones they are probably the best example. But I don't play it because of the subscription model.
---
If NCSoft was taking control that much - Things we already be far worse.
---
Cooking deserves more advertising than raids indeed. Cooking affects whole game including that raids.
---
"Raid and fractal community are integral part of our game and we are looking forward to continue support of these gamemodes"
---
&gt; maybe they can finaly fix the powercreeped one/two shot builds.
---
Easier to fix by removing direct damage and keeping conditions.
---
As many people have mentioned, the chargeback is the reason you were banned. Yes, Anet takes forever to resolve things but you need to go through them in order to resolve money issues, not chargeback. This is why I always use PayPal - it requires me to verify each charge.
---
As people have suggested, ask for your ticket to be escalated. You also could provide character details if you haven't already.
---
&gt; Reason: it will make balancing so much easier and maybe they can finaly fix the powercreeped one/two shot builds
---
Interesting take considering it's power builds doing the one shotting.
---
Everytime someone brings up the 'those people have rose tinted glasses' argument, I can't help but think 'maybe you just have black-tinted ones?'
---
There is a constant and consistent playerbase in old classic Everquest, FFXI and WoW servers that is pretty substantial. Just because some people prefer an MMO that is older in design doesn't mean they're nostalgic and only fueled by such. These are the people who think that Cataclysm was the downfall of WoW, who think that any MMO's 'New Player Experience' was the beginning of the end of their STOs, COs, FFXIs, GW2s, and so on and so on because it took away the elements of the game that they enjoyed in favor for modern MMO design elements.
---
Let people enjoy the style of MMO design that suits them, and understand that maybe, just maybe, there is a substantial amount of people who like to see stuff like queuing, and mob tagging, and having to gear not only yourself but your friends that you made because you made a dumb joke in shout chat after taking an hour to finally get an item drop.
---
If you're there for open world and casual content then yeah, there's plenty of stuff to do.
---
If you want to experience more competitive part of the game then you might get disappointed because:
---
 
---
1) it's not really that competitive (but subjectively still quite fun) 
---
2) it lacks regular updates (such as new content and balance patches)
---
3) it's not very populated and it's harder and harder to get into it considering that veterans are leaving and the rest of the community doesn't know how to organize themselves.
---
boredom mostly.
---
Really sorry you couldn't find entertainment in it man.
---
Depends on the players.
---
If they are coming from one the previous unofficial vanilla services such as Nostalrius then they are probably looking forward to the chance to play in an environment without the threat of Blizzard forcing the servers to stop running.
---
For people that have played WoW previously, they might want a hit of nostalgia or to relive certain experiences. I'm not convinced the latter will happen though because for myself personally WoW was very much about the experiences being new and novel. 
---
For the people that have never played WoW, then it is a chance to explore what was an absolutely massive cultural juggernaut a decade and a half ago. It might not be for them, it might be. They'll soon find out if playing a game that hasn't aged well will keep them entertained and that is fine.
---
For people that play WoW currently, it's something they are getting for free, during a period where people are discontent with BfA.
---
Finally, playing something is a lot more exciting than watching a steam imo and WoW will always have a higher number of people interested (see the cultural juggernaut comment!).
---
I'm glad you're enjoying it but there is nothing social about classic WoW. If anything it was anti social when it came out. Just because you're standing in line and that forces you to talk to people to spend time doesn't make it a social game. If you want a truly social game then play RuneScape.
---
About 50€ per month i think when i actively play, on average a bit less probably
---
Should we look back how those same people were excited about Bless Online release?
---
Will the coming living story focus more on non-human story and lore? Kind of tired of the human centric pov till now.
---
I'm not one of those people who really cares but I don't think a tweet saying "Hey check out this stream" is bending over backwards
---
&gt; Things would already be far worse.
---
I remember City of Heroes too...
---
So Teapot made an event for a dying raid community and Anet punished him for it?
---
I am a casual. Could not care less
---
Yeah definitely this. It has the GW2 logo on it lol.
---
That was the joke.
---
I bet 90% of current gw2 players haven't consumed a piece of food other than the leveling rewards.
---
Okay I’m really going to watch for this because I haven’t noticed behavior like this but I’m a gold 3 player (a fair assessment of my skill level) so there’s stuff I tend to miss.
---
Yes, I have interest in classic too because I played WoW for a long time and I thought the game was great for its time.
---
That doesn't mean I'd expect it to be a fun experience, especially lacking the novelty of that first time doing something.
---
Why is Assnet so trash?
---
Depends on what else they had going on that day.
---
It really does not.
---
What lessons have they learned from LW S4 and how will it change their design intentions for S5 and onward?
---
Assnet will always be trash.
---
dunno, ask ANet. But I suppose they are well aware of the optics if that happened, so they may simply decide to "look the other way" this time
---
Eh, maybe. Or maybe it was Carol's birthday and there was cake in the breakroom.
---
What exactly are you trying to refer to? The Skyscale collection?
---
You do realise that that's a bit of side content and not relevant to the majority of the game, right? Whereas player / group tagging (and the issue that causes) is intrinsic to the entire levelling experience in vanilla WoW.
---
There is a very good reason why modern MMOs have moved away from that system, and WoW itself did about in 5.1 (tap to faction for world bosses) and 7.0 ("party" tap for the first five people).
---
Add the name to ur friends list. If it adds someone, then name is used
---
I mean, OS dont read memory of running software for shit. they manage it, but dont read it. 
---
in this thread: tons of tech-illiterates
---
Do you have a character slot free? You can use the new for that new character, then delete it. The name will be reserved for you for some time (a week?)
---
Your use of the word "lost" is telling, though I wonder if maybe English isn't your mother tongue?  Normally one would say "spent", but using "lost" infers that you don't feel you got value for the money you spent on the gem store.
---
For myself, I spent maybe $100 in total on this game, counting both expansions, and in the early days, buying some account enhancements like Bank Tab, character slot, LW S3, etc.  Since then, I'm fortunate enough to have been able to purchase gems with gold for anything I've wanted from the gem store.  That isn't to say I'm super rich, but I'm also very disciplined when it comes to managing my wants - there are many an item from the store that I would love to have, but can't justify the cost in resources.
---
Gave a chance for every one of them from Demon Souls to Sekiro, except Bloodborne, since i never owned a PS4.
---
The save/checkpoint system(or the lack of it) is what i'm talking about. Running back so much is just robbing me of my freetime. 
---
I don't mind dying if i make a mistake. I do mind when i cannot save whenever i want. If i know i might die, i want to save right before it, and i don't want all the enemies to respawn when i do. It just, as i said, "artificially expands" the time i need for the thing i actually wanna do/practice.
---
No time to start again from zero for gw3
---
Sounds like you weren't there during those days when the fabled Fractal Leaderboard was getting thrown around all the time. It's just people complaining, there's no better or worse about it
---
When can we finally look forward to Tengu playable race? Perhaps with the Cantha expansion?
---
I do not feel qualified to judge here, but since no one else did so far: compared to what I could do, those sketches are really, really good.
---
I am not sure which mistakes you speak of. Some of the proportions might not be that of an "average" human, but that's humanity for you. That makes those people more 'human', more alive, more 'likable'.
---
Vaguely, what exactly is the team working on 2+ years out that we should look forward to? They likely won't answer directly (announcing a sequel so nonchalantly just won't happen) but what is it players can look forward to beyond just more seasons. Updating the engine? Massive UI changes? Spinoffs? Porting the game to other platforms (consoles, streaming, etc)?
---
sorry to break it to you but you are absolutely a whale.
---
you spend more *per month* than what the overwhelming majority of the player base have spent.. ever
---
Or write them a mail :)
---
Many of the things one normally waits to see on sale at these events came on sale a month prior: Bank Tabs + Shared Inv slots are two of them.  I'm glad I picked up the tabs when I did, thinking it was odd they would go on sale before the anniversary sale, but had the gems so...
---
What are the major considerations when designing and implementing new elite specs? Does the process begin with a concept that is slotted into the existing framework or are deficiencies and variations in certain roles the driving force behind how an elite spec is shaped?
---
But you will forever be tied to an account and someone else's store to be able to view it. While a physical book is viewable without needing the software to view it.
---
Well, technically, school girl (and boy) uniforms was almost a [thing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/School_Uniform). And they were added to the game files during season one.
---
- new elite specs when?
---
- new dungeons or fractals? new rewards and long term goals?
---
- implementing long term rewards for every activity (adventures etc) to increase replayability?
---
- new masteries? maybe some extremely long mastery line that takes a year to exp?
---
generally ask them about implementing stuff in the game that will make players engaged for long time. collections of weapon skins isn't working for it.
---
the funny thing is, once you start doing your own grps you will see how fast the grps are being filled and that this is the reason the lfg is empty.
---
Seconded. I think we already know the answer, but would love to see the question asked.
---
GW2 has several stories and/or map hints to future content abandoned half-way. I understand that development focus at a given time might not be centered in those, but there should be an effort on finishing at least the most blatant ones. Probably the worst one is the portal in Brisban Wildlands, on the bandit bridge area, which has been teasing a new map since the launch of the game. The gate to the desert near the Ebonhawk is also one of the worst offenders, we went to Elona but still no use for that door. "E" is still a mysterious character and nothing in the near future hints to more interaction with him/her. We also have the case of Livia, a character purely appeared to please gw1 fans as myself, full of secrets and abandoned after one episode. There are more, but I'll leave it here, those above are the worst ones for me. **The question is, will the game address some of these cut stories?**
---
Second topic questions. Although I kind of remember that the answer to it has been already partially answered by ANet. Next season and future seasons (if there are), **will have 1 map per episode?** Some of the maps for last seasons are beautiful, but devoid of content capable of retaining players for too long. **Any plans to solve this problem in future maps? And how?**
---
Third topic: boons (and conditions). During GW1 there were many enchantments and curses/conditions that provided the player with myriad of possibilities. For GW2, this approach to buff and debuff was simplified to a limited set of boons and conditions only. While conditions where fairly accessible from launch, boons where more scarce and in general lower duration. One thing that also struck me was the general long cooldowns of boon skills and condi cleanse. Nowadays, boons and condi cleanse have spread more among the different classes, especially boons (too much for my taste), both in skill number and number of affected players. Condi stack application has skyrocketed after the stack limit removal for most of them, skill balances and the appearance of elite specializations. **How have these changes in boon/condi availability changed and will change your approach when designing new content?** 
---
Finally, GW2 always appealed to a more casual audience who can hop in for the time at their disposal. But not all players are like that. Open world is not exactly difficult and story instances aren't either. I'm more on the casual player side, but even for me those instances are more a walk in the park than anything. Probably, the most "difficult" one in recent times was a certain enemy in the last instance of season 4, but only because I was on a condi build and the enemy was immune to condi damage. I will admit that such gimmick was fine, and I would encourage to put more enemies that forces players into certain builds (in the example, physical damage), specially now that build templates are planned for the game. **Are there any plans to increase game difficulty a little bit?** It seems reasonable that players that reach the latest content should have more experience in the systems and be able to beat a more difficult content within reason (it's still story and open world, really difficult content should be devoted to other areas of the game). For reference, open world difficulty in HoT at its launch was fine, I don't know why it was toned down. Well, in fact I know why it was done, the complains, but expansion players should have the knowledge to beat it, maybe struggle at the beginning, but finally overcome it and become better players.
---
That's it. Feel free to cut/simplify any question if you decide to ask it/them, I just wanted to give a little bit of context for each one, sorry for the wall of text.
---
If you want to make it harder than it has to be on yourself, sure you can.
---
There's a reason you use 5 DHs (or 4 DHs &amp; 1 PFB) for easy faceroll clears.
---
I think fractals are fine, they continue to develop at least. Raids are actively developed and cool but just way too easy for the hard core population, and there’s no difficulty modes (sadly).
---

* Has many sensible explanations! For instance, getting players to populate other content which may be sparse with players.
---
* Does not affect the vast majority of normal playtime.
---
* Its purpose *is* to get players to abandon content, at least the content they're working to the bone.
---
* If it was not subtle, excessive farmers would know exactly when to move on, farm somewhere else and come back. This would make their farm more efficient.
---
This was simply the system they used for vanilla maps. I can only assume they designate some maps as "farming maps" where they allow farming to happen for much longer, which needs to be tweaked a bit IMO.
---
Do you have any alternative for E-Specs?
---
Do you plan on expanding classes via Living World?
---
Are we going to get away from Elder Dragons threat?
---
Are you happy with the current Balance?
---
I was, It was nowhere near as complained about as lack of communication is right now.
---
It is the voice of the salty redditor, do not listen to their cries.
---
And an easy mode for future raids?
---
Dragonfall is only a small start but not the solution, there are still to many problems with this approach, it only did stand out because we litarly hat nothing even close to that since the HoT core maps (and even they got nerft into oblivion to make them nothing then meaningless afk 11111 fights).
---
Anet could have gone for a middle ground or kept at lest some of the previous event fights on their original difficulty, but now everything is trivialized and people do them less and less.
---
Anet just dont understand how advantageous it would be to have contant again wich require communities working together rather then being able to to every single content solo without real interaction with other players. Guild and communites are one of the biggest fundamental pillar in other MMOs to bind players together and to their game, but anet doesnt give any reasons for them to exist in gw2 at all.
---
Damn, I thought the tea would be hotter, but oh well.
---
But thanks for the answer.
---
In that context I'd like to know: 
---
* What is their reasoning for only releasing balance patches every 3 months?
---
PvP and WvW could be a lot more enjoyable / balanced even with number-only changes (higher CD, lower dmg, etc.) and their skill-split system would allow them to pass these changes without affecting PvE.
---
But...but...but my tea, and leggings, and a watch?
---
Diablo is a top down dungeon crawler. Admittedly, I don't play those type of games so I have no idea what kind of controls they use. The gameplay is entirely different between the two though, so it's not really a good comparison, I would say.
---
This is.... wrong.
---
I have played it. But guess its subjective. I just think GW2 has offered far more engaging and varying encounters and its potential is much higher than of FFXIV's. And has far more potential and freedom to do so (not that they have capitalised on all that potential).
---
That's awesome! I've always had the idea of building Divinity's Reach in Minecraft... maybe one day.
---
I agree that Aurene causes the aurora at the end of the episode, but I still think it could be a visual hint of things to come.
---
What are you plans to revitalize the languishing game modes of PvP and WvW? While the additions of Swiss Tournaments and Alliances will be welcome additions, the former does nothing for the typical ranked player, and the former does may of the other problems plaguing the game mode. 
---
Will Arena Net be giving these areas of the game the constant love and care they need and deserve?
---
So the Raid that took 9 months to develop that is actually your end game PvE content deserves an entire livestream to showcase. Meanwhile Anet cant do more than make a unappealing trailer with Qadim waving his hands to actually advertise.
---
Bored of GW2 not having any real content
---
What in your opinion is the biggest mistake you made in terms of developing gw2 thus far?
---
How am i being disinfenuous? The only thing that i implied was that games that actually require you to actually play the game are better in design than the direction that Anet has taken this one into.
---
can you elaborate on this about chargebacks blacklisting you? i havent any problems myself but this thread is an interesting read so far, i dont know much about finances yet
---
Sure we can if you want.
---
&gt;Personally, I doubt it's a hint. But it wouldn't surprise me if midway through Season 5 goes "yeah guys, the aurora at the end of Season 4 was alluding to this!" or something.
---
I agree completely. This might not be *the* hint, but this is probably the degree of hint they were referring to as being put into the end of Season 4.
---
Has support suggested anything?
---
What were your troubleshooting results?
---
On the FFXIV note, that was "Raubahn EX" at the start of Stormblood just over 2 years ago.  Players formed lines much like you see in WoW Classic now to try and get through the instanced battle that was part of the main story questline (which unlike GW2 is mandatory to complete)
---
Not true, stacking is always useful because every class has AoE damage options. People would use stacking strats long before the FGS trick was ever figured out.
---
I said in the thread, there's no accounting for taste. There's also no accounting for the difference between armor skins and outfits. We get armor skins overwhelmingly in-game, and many people will always prefer those to outfits. You also can't account for prestige in this kind of analysis. Gem store stuff has zero prestige, but legendary armor and trinkets, or even some of try upgraded living story armor, all carry some prestige.
---
If I could trouble you with a philosophical question, what's the crucial point of difference between a Fractal and a "dungeon?"
---
As far as I'm concerned, they do drop in new dungeons based on Fractal tech from time to time. They just call them Fractals.
---
&gt; seer/kodan structures design
---
Do you happen to have any theories on what civilization built the Eye of the North? Obviously in its introductory cutscene, Ogden said it wasn't Dwarven, and the player character says its too ancient to be human. But again it seems to be pretty unique in design. It's a mystery I've always been interested in, but unless they address it in LS5, I don't think they've really given us enough to figure out where it came from. I'd be interested in your thoughts.
---
I don't think it's ridiculous.  I'm actually somewhere in-between casual and hardcore, and my heart breaks for the loss of these players.  You just have to realize what they actually do for the community- all the sites teaching us when we were noobs, those are sites created and run by the hardcore community. All the DPS testing of specs and builds, also done by the hardcore community. A game without a hardcore player base is a game with no soul.
---
Just wait until they reach endgame. With the endless attunement quests and resist gear farms before they can even think of entering a Raid.
---
why dont you start play raids and fractals all day so lfg in certain time wont be so dead?
---
Only thing it's gonna kill is the few last brain cells these people have.
---
"Ladies" Mhm.
---
The FFXIV issue isn't what you think it was. 
---
The issue in FFXIV was during Stormblood, primarily, and was an issue of their instance servers not being able to handle the sheer amount of players trying to get into the instance. There was nothing to steal and technically forming a queue didn't help or make anything smoother - players just did it because if it gives the \*illusion\* of making things smoother, they feel like they get into the instance faster.
---
The choke point wasn't because you had to talk to an NPC. The choke wasn't because there was a mob you had to kill that everybody was kill-stealing. The choke was because the servers were dogshit and Square have been historically very terrible at estimating how many players they're going to have online trying to dogpile into solo instances to progress their story.
---
Everybody could talk to that NPC at the same time and spam him if they wanted. So honestly, you should probably edit your post, because the FFXIV choke wasn't caused by what you were claiming it was caused by.
---
Yes I'm aware. I've been complaining about the release cadence since it became an issue and have also been pointing out the issue with streamers, and many people in this sub, only now having an issue with a 7 to 9 month release cadence that has been consistent since July 2016.
---
I disagree with Wing 7 being the worst. Strongly. Are the encounters somewhat easier if you can execute the mechanics? Absolutely, but they are also more punishing than what you find in Wing 4 if you can't and the bosses are actually well designed to be tackled with a range of strategies. I'd prefer the CMs to be trickier, but of course I would as a player with DD, VitV, CoZ and EAoA.
---
I've also been one of the people shouting the most for variable difficulties but I can also see that raiders are being catered to, unless you are the absolute hardcore of hardcore that were never once catered to by raids in GW2.
---
Last raid wing? Citation or evidence please. The only basis for that would be the conclusion of the legendary ring collection, but I suppose BotP was also the last raid wing because of the armor collection finishing?
---
The perks of being a mage in vanilla =D
---
I wouldn't call it a pain per se. I actually like trying to figure out the mechanics of a new raid boss, figuring out a strategy for that and executing it to get a kill on the boss is quite satisfying.
---
That isn't how the game works. Sadly I didn't just press F at some nodes to get my VitV. Try harder with the trolling in the future, love.
---
What’s the respawn timer? I’m curious how long 1 person’s turn takes
---
The rose-tinted glasses never last long. Several games have brought out classic servers of their game. People flock to it, play it for the nostalgia, start remembering all the sucky things they forgot about and realise how many improvements have been made, then most go back to updated version of the game.
---
Im not trolling, can you explain to me why CM rewards are not at least partially repeatable?
---
R/titlegore
---
The real MVP
---
So you are here only to spread toxicity? In a forum that doesn't affect you in any way. Sounds like a social complex.
---
my unpopular opinion , downvote me to hell : any single dark sould from demon soul onwards is just a dance dance revolution game.
---
it requires no skill but learning every single monster and their attac. every enemy is always in the same spot and do the same thing. learn it and you will win. miss a hit and you will bepunished. 
---
i fully completed demon soul and the first dark soul with all the achievements both before realizing this.  it's stupid
---
The thing is, that money is what we talk here. There is a lot of frauds around that, and especially chargeback is one thing that is connected to it in general.
---
The major fraud way is that some criminal steals credentials and uses them to pay online for stuff. This can go unnoticed for a while, and when the offended person realises, they usually can just do chargeback to prevent their money loss. However, the digital goods were delivered and sometimes even consumed. Banks are insured against this and thus the offended person will get their money back easily, but the payment company still can keep their flags based on this history. And game companies have to return the payment and usually even pay chargeback fee to the payment company. Game devs can't do much about it, they can just ban the keys sold, track gold bought from those payments, and that's it. They never know if the chargeback was this scheme or some person made mistake, until they get in regular contact. In case you do such mistake, you need to speak with devs, with banks, and be sure to clear the record with everyone involved. Sometimes credit cards are blocked even automatically before you even paid with them (happened to me for example) and one had to contact support to let them enable it. This world is jsut full of "better safe than sorry" and getting on some blacklist because your miss step looks like typical fraud scenario is pretty easy. Also one more reason why to not use non-aproved resellers as those are way more often susceptible for those frauds (you don't know where the game key comes from).
---
Here you can get similar story from Factorio devs, good read, links for even more articles about problematics:
---
&gt; [FFF#145](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-145)
---
&gt; * Someone obtains credit card numbers somehow.
---
&gt; * He buys Factorio keys (among other things) with these cards on our site
---
&gt; * Then these keys are transferred somehow to these "good deal" sites where they can be bought for cheaper price.
---
&gt; * Eventually, the card owner finds out and cancels all the transactions, we get a notice about every faulty transaction
---
&gt; * Not only we don't get the money paid, but we have to pay extra $20 fee per every transaction that was cancelled.
---
&gt; * As reaction to this, we have to deactivate all keys bought this way, which results in steam key deactivations as well.
---
&gt; * So in the end, we are 20$ short and we lost time dealing with it and the buyer doesn't have the game he paid for.
---
&gt; [FFF#171](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-171)
---
&gt; * A purchase is made on our website using a stolen credit card, hacked paypal etc.
---
&gt; * The purchaser sells the key on the grey market within a couple of days.
---
&gt; * Some weeks later the owner of the credit card notices, and issues a chargeback to us.
---
Is this scenario similar to OP's story? The only difference is that OP got error and double payment, not hacker on his account, but from devs perspective this looks identical. If they miss the connection to the second payment (easy, they can see only the chargeback notice and act on it), they can't tell those two stories apart.
---
[FFF#303](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-303) The most actual blog about it, also about how G2A fits into the scheme. 
---
Banks and payment companies do have really advanced tools to fight those shady bussinesses, a lot of tracking, heuristics, analyzes...and blocking until proven otherwise is very easy to do and actualyl prevents the money loss. Getting phone from customer and clarifying it out is better than dealing with money loss.
---
long ago tx god. it mean we are less player and it's ok to me till they keep the server up
---
I don't hesitate to buy what I like, but that has resulted in me spending maybe $100–150 total since launch day 2012.
---
To be fair, I was plat only a few times and never for long.
---
ok, please teach me, (no sarcasm) how should i have written the title to be in problem english ?
---
They were removed because of a philosophy of "seeing the action, not the Interface", but the visual noise is so high that it's impossible to actually see what your target is doing, sometimes even when it's an Epic rank boss.
---
And there's enemies with no real tells of what they are doing like corrupted storm elementals.
---
Dude, let the guy play another game. Jfc, who cares?
---
I haven't seen any interview that is about new stuff.
---
Lol, you did wrong. Downvote to hell. xD
---
Literally everyone involved (hint: it's not arenanet) views chargebacks as malicious.
---
Heh. Just the other day I was saying "You are the champ, kid" to the same question.
---
Good thing I used my garbage collector e-mail and fake FB account.
---
How do they know the password was leaked?
---
Currently? Eidolons and Orbs are the endgame. You need some pretty fine-tuned gear to take on Eidolons, less so for Orbs but still out of reach for many. They're the closest thing to raids in Warframe.
---
You also have Arbitrations which can be quite punishing, but they're not particularly fun due to all the bullshit thrown in. Elite Sanctuary Onslaught might also be seen as endgame by some, but it's fairly straightforward with a good build.
---
these are quite nice!
---
Aha... So what is this comment about that you have the desire to bother me? I'm not interested in the story of your live.
---
Guild Content. Are we getting new content? Do you want to rework or polish some of the existing guild content? New varities of guild content?
---
there are

* 7 raids which are 10-man instances at max level
---
* 8 dungeons that you can do as you're leveling up, each with 3 different paths you can take each time (4 for the last one) which are 5-man instances. These can be done while leveling, but most people who do them are max level for specific dungeon loot.
---
* 20 fractals which are like light-dungeons which you generally do in sets of about 3 at a time, arranged into 100 difficulty levels, split between 4 tiers. These are also 5-man instances, but they're done at max level. In terms of active development, these have pretty much replaced dungeons.
---
as for "skills", there is armor crafting (all three weight classes, heavy, medium, and light), weapon crafting (split between melee, ranged (plus torch and warhorn), and magical), jeweler, chef, and scribe (guild related crafter)
---
There are no life skills though if that's what you're wondering. No fishing, or things like that.

Because nostalgia. That's it. Period.

People always look back and remember the good, and yearn for it, and completely forget all the things that were frustrating when it was new (aka all the QoL things they bitched about until they were changed).

Companies know this, and they're reaping the profits from consumers who eagerly throw money at them to be able to see movies they've already seen, or play games that they swore they'd never touch again a decade ago.

WvW is dead and has been dead for ages, its' demise is complicated; for the longest time, anet has trying to resolve the server imbalance: by breaking up monopolies, only to be met with fierce opposition from the player base. Elite specs further exacerbate the issue and widens the "skill-gap". WvW has been in steady decline ever since, and no amount of resources spent on it could reserve the trend. The mount

ok let me put it this way. it's possible that when we go north we'll see northeren lights but the aurora borealis we saw at the end of season 4 tells us nothing about it's story significance at best i expect it to e nothing more then a nice map visual (if it appears) and if it does have story significance then the ending would still not be a hint at it.
---
TLDR: it's a nice visual that might get reused but i don't see how it will have any story significance that the ending could be hinting at
---
Will End-game content in all modes see equal treatment this season or will LWS5 + Casual content be the priority?

Will there be more QoL updates/packs or anything spicy/long-wanted added to the game?

Any news regarding dungeons?
---
Huge missed opportunity for them to develop new dungeon content.
---
Well, I respectfully disagree here. W5 might be closest to it, but it doesn't reach the destination. Imho, Desmina contains too much randomness with the wall spawns, the two events aren't that exciting anyway, and Dhuum would have been a glorious fight if it wasn't for the green mechanic. The engine doesn't handle orb collection well and I hate it when devs introduce stuff about which they must know that their engine does it badly.
---
That's why there's no masterpiece in GW2's raids for me. A masterpiece would be on the level of System Daemons, Avatus, Navigation Core (well, that one maybe was a bit too much, actually), or, going back further in my raiding history, stuff like Kael'Thas or Yogg-Saron. GW2 doesn't reach those levels.

it throws me an error, seems something is wrong with the base path.

in the script my variable base is './drive\_c/Program Files/Guild Wars 2/bin64/'

the script is in the bin64 folder of gw2. Somehow it takes the path inside wine 2 times.

I tried changing the base variable to only './' then the log file gets created in the bin64 folder and says, the d3d9.dll is not existing (even it exists). After that the script just freezes without any error or more log info.

Yeah well I'm Irish so I understood it, not the best on Irish folklore though. You get some right, some wrong.

It was brutal because no one had ever been forced to optimize very much before that, and because the game (specifically dps but also supports to a degree) hadn't been power crept yet. If it's hard for people now it's because they're bad, power creep has negated dps checks and cheese builds like minstrel chrono and heal scourge have negated important mechanics like retal on gorse or vg greens.
---
Just to clarify, wiping doesn't mean the raid wing is hard, it's only hard for you/your group if you're hard stuck on an encounter for many hours/days, and if you're hard stuck on wing 1 it's because your group is either uninformed or not trying very hard.

---
&gt;its their EULA, they can decide when to enforce it and when not
---
And that's the point. There is absolutely no reason to not sponsor an event that uses a custom, privately developed camera precisely because they chose when to enforce their EULA. This is not some random ass tool off the internet with an anonymous developer, the tool was made precisely for this purpose, and was not going to be released. Anet could have perfectly sponsored the event and let people running big events like this one with the tool enabled.

They know that *some* of your passwords got leaked, based on same e-mail/account name connected to that password. They don't need to know if that password is same or not for their service, but there is pretty good assumption that many people reuse their passwords, so just based on finding your username there , it gives them good ground for password reset.

That's the better case. The worse case would be if they actually matched your password as well, better to not think about that then...

If we get a new elite spec soon I'm guna be so hype. Something about having *three* elite specs per class now just feels like it opens up a whole ton of choice, since we'll start to see some significant redundancies in roles, so playstyle differences will become more important. I'm hype

You're using the word "typo" wrong.
---
A "typo" is where you just hit the wrong key or hit them in the wrong order -- "teh" instead of "the", etc. Typing the wrong content or sentence entirely isn't a typo, it's.. well, it's typing the wrong content, for whatever reason. Misunderstanding of the situation, accidental leak, whatever. 
---
One is a mechanical error, the other is a content error.
---
GW2 has one of the most enjoyable foundations of any of the games I played. From ideas such as shared XP (from kills and events) over to shared nodes and even something like deposit mats from your inventory or being able to access TP on the go, ... all those elements just make the game incredibly accessible.
---
I just wish I just wish the game's content was as good. It would be amazing to see all the devs implement the GW2 solutions and build their stories on top of it, because I constantly find myself checking out new games and they are simply not as accessible as GW2, but each time I start up GW2, I am fast put off by the way A.Net designs their content.
---
It's why I keep wishing we'd get GW3, with GW2's QoL and GW1's style content.

Except it's entirely valid feedback, there is no entitled whining and I'm not screeching for anything.
---
You do realize that Arenanet has consistently dropped the ball on multiple things right?  
---
Their priority for an entire update was for sittable chairs.
---
Chairs.
---
World vs World end-game players are leaving in droves because they keep being promised Alliances and consistently it's something entirely useless to them, this isn't a joke, they only get horrible balance patches which destroy any meta they use.
---
PvP is consistently still having problems with toxicity, botting, account sharing and lack of actual interesting/useful content. Arenanet is literally giving them 2v2 maps but there are no queues for 2v2, effectively making the maps a bait and switch.
---
People literally just do WvW for dailies and get to 2000 to get legendary armor, anyone who consistently plays that game-mode has genuinely grinded out all the meaningful content, and this has been done for years at this point, they've had nothing.
---
PvP is for getting to the top but it's the same account-sharing players that keep sitting there with no punishment, there is no plaque or meaningful reward to getting to the top, there are people farming it and Arenanet won't add any other content to alleviate this or think about ways to fix any of their problems.
---
I better not mention raids because that seems to be a soft spot for you and I fear you'd call me an entitled whiner again (uwu dont hurt me daddy).
---
You do realize that when enough people are complaining about how their content is handled entirely, at some point it becomes not whining but an actual issue that needs to be dealt with right? Your entire argument is these people are whining and it'll never be perfect, but that's not what anyone is whining about, they're receiving next to no ***meaningful*** content that will help the game-mode in the long term.
---
Wait, they finally scrap raid?
---
Then why play the game even? The hard content *is* the fun part.
---
ANet isn't the only gaming company to do this, though. Blizzard banned Pepe for at least a while during Overwatch League's first season (not sure if that remained in effect -- I don't keep track anymore).
---
Even then, hard to do.  I just finished the golden child achievement, and how long has HoT been out?  I can't finish a release before there's a new one, and GW2 is literally all I do because I live in jack nowhere.  How completely hardcore do you have to rush a release to not have anything to do after a day?

A quick lesson on secure password storage and how a login is checked: 
---
1. User sets their password.
---
2. On the backend a random salt value is generated and associated with that user.
---
2. Salt value is added to the password, and the whole thing is hashed.
---
3. The username, hash, and hash value are stored on the backend. Plaintext password is thrown away on the backend.
---
4. Whenever the user logs in, the plain text password they enter has their unique salt added, and the hash operation is repeated. The hash that's just been generated is compared with the one that was previously stored. If the two values match, it means the user entered the right password
---
So when a breach of a third party happens. Lists of usernames/emails and plaintext passwords are leaked publicly.
---
The check can be performed by using step 4 from above. Run the leaked password through step 4, if it matches, issue a password reset for that user.
---
&gt;However, how often do you think the spectator cam will be used if it was added to raids? Probably far less than it would justify the time it takes to implement it.
---
And how does that have anything to do with Arenanet not chosing to sponsor an event that uses ***an existing camera tool that was privately developed specifically for this event***?
---
&gt;We don't know if they can adapt existing code for spectator modes like from PvP into any other format, maybe but probably not as just copy-pasting it. This will take time and effort.
---
Again, the tool already exists with zero cost from Anet's part. Anet refused to sponsor an event that they could well have invested literally zero money into because they didn't develop the camera tool, TaCo, or any other software/media used in the event, and all they had to do was give gems codes to the winners and a couple twitter posts for publicity, maybe even a news article on the client's splash.
---
&gt; If the game had such tools then this wouldn't be an issue but since it doesn't they had to say no. 
---
The game also doesn't have tools like Taco and that wasn't the issue, since the only tool they put as the reason to not sponsor the event was the camera tool, and there's nothing like Taco ingame either.
---
I think the wording of the message is what made me pause. They said that the "password was exposed," not that the email was in the list of exposed accounts. I'm hoping your first take is the correct one, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised that they have a database of the passwords and emails stored in plain text.
---
Nice. What’s the software/App ?
---
Afaik, they abandon it all to Fractals. Shorter and smaller map/design = less cost and more time for gemstore. Plus fractals already has its own reward treatmill and gate.

ArenaNet didn't charge him twice. ArenaNet gem transactions are done through Digital River, which is a third party company. *Many* publishers use a third party for managing financial transactions between player and in-game store.
---
The correct course of action every single time, if an error occurs, is to contact the support team of that company - in this case, ArenaNet's. Chargebacks *cost* a company money and are most frequently seen in cases of fraud, which is why they warrant immediate bans *and* blacklists from every single company that it happens to. It takes a longer time to go through support, but it's the only proper way to get the dispute resolved.
---
If you aren't willing to wait that long, then yes, the responsibility is your own to accept: it is very commonly known that chargebacks warrant immediate account bans and blacklists *anywhere they happen*, and so if you decide to go that route instead of contacting support so they can fix the error, you have to accept the consequences for taking that action.
---
The big thing that I can see for why they failed, is that they just weren't properly designed, both from a gameplay perspective, and a technical one.  From a technical perspective, they are apparently just a total mess of spaghetti code; early in the game's life, it was common for pretty much every update to break something, somewhere in a dungeon; of course bugs that helped players (shortening runs, making encounters easier) were hotfixed ASAP, while blocks and bugs that made things more annoying/difficult were often left for months.  With the Lost Shores update, we got Fractals, and these were generally designed better, from a technical perspective. They weren't perfect by any means, but issues generally cropped up far less often than dungeons. 
---
From a gameplay perspective, they were both badly rushed, and suffered from the devs designing them using their experience from GW1; this wouldn't necessarily have been a problem, but in GW2, you can jump, so the dungeons were (and some still are) often cheesed with strats that relied on jumping over obstacles to sequence break, or jumping on a bit of terrain the designers didn't expect, which could often break the AI.  Their stated goal prior to launch, was to balance the paths to be of roughly equal length and difficulty, but because of how they were rushed out, the reality fell far short, to where something like CoF P1 could be completed in 5-6 minutes by experienced PUGs, while the longer Arah paths would take 15+ minutes even for coordinated speedrun groups, and 40+ minutes for PUGs.
---
Between the above issues, and the fact that dungeons actually have a lot of unique, high-quality rewards (an entire armor and weapon set, unique tonics, runes, and sigils) ArenaNet decided to abandon their efforts on expanding dungeons, and focus on fractals going forward.  This decision was likely made easier by the fact that both major dungeon updates post-launch (a revamp of Ascalonian Catacombs, and the addition of the Twilight Arbor Aetherpath) were received pretty poorly by the community at the time.  It's hard for me to argue with the decision either; at the time, I think the call was correct. I do however wish they had given dungeons more love in the initial development phase, so that they could have been properly supported for the life of the game, because I do prefer them to fractals, mostly.  I like how dungeons feel more grounded in the world, and there are some genuinely neat ideas there.
---
Are there any plans to add ways for players to show what kind of content they support development in when they purchase from gemstore? This would allow better filtering about the demands of the customers who support the game regularly.
---
just curious, wouldn't it be possible for some asshole to jump queue and tag whatever target is there? if yes then nothing will happen to him right?
---
But what happens when they get used in LS5 to craft a Chak Egg Sac? Someone will be looking *very* silly then!

Not another month to get new content ._.

---
I had no intention at all of striking a nerve or acting condescending, so I'm sorry if it came out that way. But I still completely disagree with a lot of your points, and I don't need to be an optimistic person to take that stance.
---
I have to remind you that we always had time-gated stuff. Mawdrey, one of the most popular collections of LS2, had entirely blatant time-gating that was arguably just as bad if not worse than the Skyscale. Bioluminescence and the Ambrite Weapons, while not daily timegated in as "arbitrary" a manner as you claim, was *essentially* timegated because of the insane waiting times for events to spawn. Celestial armour needed a whole month of timegate to obtain. Various HoT rewards, from guild hall upgrades to legendary armour, have plenty of timegates. Laurels, being the only feasible way of obtaining many ascended trinkets in the past, are blatantly timegated. Ascended materials can only be crafted once per day for no other reason than "the UI makes it so". Dungeons, fractals, raids, keyfarm... it's all timegated. You're acting like the timegated stuff they're doing right now is new or at least never before done to this extent, but I feel like you're ignoring basically the game's entire history.
---
Meanwhile, you can get a full set of Elegy armour by doing a small sidequest with some material requirements. All mounts except the Skyscale have no timegates (or only minor ones like waiting for a couple of events to spawn). Bounties can be spawned at any time. Adventures can be done at any time. Mist Shard armour can be obtained without any timegates and at essentially any pace you desire. Dragonsblood weapons have a very manageable timegate of 1-2 per day (and really, besides completionism, do you need more than a couple of them anyway?). Astral/Stellar weapons - fine, they have a 7-day arbitrary timegate before you can start obtaining them, which is annoying... but also impossible to circumvent with gold/gems so your "ArenaNet are pushing players to spend gold/gems and skip timegates" argument does not apply to that collection either.
---
Timegates in GW2 *can* be very beneficial. Imagine if you could farm T4 fractals as much as you want and get the daily chest each time. Imagine if every raid boss you kill gave you 2 or 4 gold, an exotic+rare, and ascended drop chances. Imagine if gathering nodes refreshed themselves every time you relogged. Time gates are there to stop content from becoming farmable to the point of ridiculousness. They allow people that have only 2 hours of gameplay every day to not be completely left behind by those that have 14 hours of gameplay every day. They keep gold in check and stop the no-life farmers from inflating it till it's out of control.
---
You might argue that those kind of timegates are fine, and it's the arbitrary timegates slapped on collections that stop you from progressing that are a problem. And yeah, you sort of have a point that they're kind of annoying. But like... is it really that terrible? Is it the end of the world that the Skyscale takes 4 days instead of 1? Or that you can only start getting your Astral weapons 7 days after you unlock the episode? Yeah it's annoying and I don't agree with the concept of randomly introducing content blocks for no reason other than padding, but I really cannot empathise with people that treat timegates in this game as such a massive issue.
---
The sigils of nullification thing was dumb, no two ways about that. They introduced a recipe for them so it's hardly a problem anymore.
---
Re: the outfits/gliders/mounts thing. I think it's pretty obvious that the only reason we got in-game obtainable glider skins is that they're tied to legendary backpieces. They put very little effort in turning Ad Infinitum, The Ascension, or Warbringer into a backpiece. No moving parts, no special effects, hardly any change from the backpiece model. All three of them are also exorbitant to craft, and the gold you put into making them would be enough to buy many gemstore glider skins with gems conversion. The distinction between in-game rewards and gemstore items is almost arbitrary in this case.
---
As for outfits, making a blanket statement that "outfits are getting shinier" is a very subjective claim and arguing it would be moot. All I can say is, having taken a skim at the outfits we have in the game and noting their release date, I'm of the opinion that the times pre legendary armour had their fair share of [shiny](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystal_Savant_Outfit), [conspicuous](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ice_Encasement_Outfit), and [gaudy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ghostly_Outfit) outfits and times post legendary armour have their fair share of [subtle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Noble_Courtier_Outfit), [tasteful](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Taimi%27s_Outfit), and [unremarkable](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zafirah%27s_Tactical_Outfit) outfits. I don't notice a particular trend beyond perhaps that newer stuff might have more recent tech allowing for certain particle effects and dyeing that wasn't possible in the past.
---
And yeah, they're pushing hard on mount skins. Can't deny that. They're crazy expensive and involve gambling, and ArenaNet know they can still make profit out of them because mount skins are big, easy to show off, and extremely easy to monetise. I agree that they haven't been the picture of respectable when it comes to mount skins. But firstly, the gemstore is no stranger to sleazy stuff like this (gambling and aggressive monetisation have always been a thing). Secondly, like I've always said when it comes to the gemstore, if this kind of monetisation is what's needed to sustain an F2P game with no sub fee, then I'll *gladly* take it. None of the other MMOs out there have no sub fee, are free to pick up, have virtually no P2W, and have a cash shop where everything can be obtained in-game. This is of course only my opinion, but I find the somewhat aggressive monetisation of cosmetics such a small price to pay for all of the good qualities.
---
Finally, I'm not urging people to stop criticising the game. I just get a little worn out seeing so many friends, guildies, and Redditors making claims like "we hardly get any in-game rewards anymore" or "timegates are just there to milk the playerbase of their money", statements that are either factually false or opinions that I very heavily disagree with.
---
It's only 3 weeks from today.

It seems like it will be the name. I hope Anet pays honor to the name and actually brings us something to look upon for the future.
---
Soo this post really went completely off to the charge back side, but that's not the point. 
---
I only wanted to know if there is any other way to talk to someone, or anything else i can do, which i didn't really get much answers for, but whatever. 
---
I know the chargeback has to do with it because i didn't do anything else (I only played the the game for like 40-50 hours at max) that could've caused a suspension/ban. 
---
However, I did contact Digital River first, when they said they  have nothing to do with this, **then** I contacted GW2 support, and when they didn't do anything for **2 weeks**, i went to paypal. 
---
I just want to get an answer, if it's because of the chargeback and I can't do anything, then fine, whatever, I'll make a new account. But the point is that they can't identify me with literally every information that I could give. That's my problem.

Exactly.
---
Yes, there are legit grievances about the game. There are many things that need some attention -- raids, pvp, and wvw, particularly.
---
But the community also has a tendency to shift from thrilled by new content to bored and bitter at the drop of a damn hat. It's completely fair to get bored and feel resteless and anxious for something new to happen, but the problem is people feeling that way and then suddenly magnifying every little thing ANet has ever done wrong, and greatly exaggerating the amount of time they've been "without content". A month after a new release, and people are complaining like they haven't seen anything new in years. Two weeks after people are praising ANet for touching base and beginning to connect with the community again, giving us a tentative roadmap for some things, giving us events like World Boss rush, etc. and suddenly the community is upset because "ANet never talks to us and never gives us anything". Just the other day someone was complaining about the lack of new weapon skins when we have them thrown at us faster than I can unlock them.
---
LW chapters *still* come faster than "new content" in any other game I've played. I understand that it's not fast enough for everyone, and that's not the content that *everyone* wants, and that's understandable -- I just wish people would stop acting like those things either don't happen, don't matter at all, or that there aren't players who actually do enjoy that content and find the pace acceptable (I am part of that group).

Seems like it, and from the new weapons that just dropped it seems to do with underwater/icy stuff. (We knew about the icy part but the underwater thing is up to speculation still).

it's most likely just long release schedule because of the production process, printing etc

As long as this doesn't mean underwater focused content I'm fine with it. The skins look great.

Defeating Jormag inadvertently undoes Shiro's curse and reverts the Jade Sea, which activates Bubbles who was trapped by the Jade Wind!
---
Takes notes kids- there ***will*** be a quiz!
---
with your last word I feel like you gave your question a very negative direction, I would suggest replacing it with "planed".
---
I don't know, it's possible we could see some water stuff but most of a black lion weapon sets have had nothing to do with the current patch theme
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
won't happen. gw3 would kill anet. not all the playerbase would move to gw3 so 3 games to mantain when they barely can do with one
---
all of them looks amazing, I wonder why it took so much time to implement them.
---
priorities I guess.
---
I'm talking about pve, though, not WvW.  Even then, those are additional years of farming...
---
This made me lul more than it should have
---
Ocean = Sea?!!
---
We are sailing north to ~~Vabbi~~ Cantha!
---
To be fair they have the announcement on friday. Should of expected this week to be lite in terms of a patch day.
---
2015? Wtf .. I wasn't even playing at this point I have nearly 3k hours atm.
---
Okay, so back to my previous point.  That's just denying a lot of cool stuff because you don't want to do it...?
---
I'm pretty sure magic find has no effect on those
---
Must be related to PvP content then.
---
Ever tried fighting with metal weapons in molten metal?
---
Same thing.
---
For you as journalist I wanna give some background. Here is the overview of releases: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release
---
A big complain of the community has been the very long wait between story releases
---
* 2017 Nov
---
* 2018 Mar
---
* 2018 June
---
* 2018 Sep
---
* 2019 Jan
---
* 2019 May
---
So my question would be (if not covered in the presentation), how often they are planing to bring out new STORY content.
---
Bear bow ranger.
---
Haha I knew it ! Did you algo go for each race per.armor archetype?
---
IF true and accurate, then he will end up blacklisted in the industry and rightfully so. I am sure that it would also greatly impact the elder scrolls 6 whenever that is to release as well.
---
Yes, absolutely. I was just pointing out that back then, there really didn't seem to be a crazy amount of interest in keeping the collections. Right after they were released, Reddit was plagued with threads about event bugs and events being required to fail. When they announced the suspension of legendary weapon development, it was natural for people to just agree that the [collections should be scrapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4byfou/work_on_new_legendary_weapons_suspended/d1did94/).
---
Would collections with interesting quest lines, no bugs, and no required failure cases be better than what we're getting now? Probably. Is it really worth the developer resources? Arguable.
---
Man I wanna see a direct link to that comment. It summed up my GW2 experience so well it's scary.
---
true. then maybe it's google meddling or they are still producing it, or they want to include LS5 concept art which is under production, still we have multiple reasons
---
yeah no. the under water "rework" wasn't nearly extensive enough to make UW good. also making more skills work UW isn't really a rework of UW combat
---
millions people listen to justin bieber. numbers does not mean quality.  denial of wat that wow has more players?
---
&gt; PvP and WvW didn't get any meaningful updates in years 
---
Didn't they add the 2v2 map earlier this month?
---
Well shit...Total Annihilation was one of my favourite OST's.
---
One shot mesmers, i'd say.
---
To be honest, I would have bought the deluxe version of PoF if it came with an exclusive mount skin. I had no interest in another outfit and lounge pass.
---
This is horrible. I’m speechless. I hope he will get what he deserves, nothing less. My prayer goes to the victim. I find this guy completely disgusting. What a tragedy
---
As long it mentions it on the box it will have it afaik but yeah do t remem er those having it
---
I personally want the opposite. The 'just an adventure' stories are usually super uninteresting to me, especially further in a game when major threats have already been established. They feel extremely out of place and forced, lacking any sort of tension or stakes especially when there are legitimate threats out there and questions to be answered. We can still explore new regions, though there has to be a compelling reason for it. With Elder Dragons being very relevant right now via Jormag influence and a lot of new unknows about them from War Eternal, rushing it would be a huge waste.
---
Best vid I’ve seen all week
---
Ok, I'm in.
---
Being able to start from stealth only makes it more egregious.
---
Fuck I was expecting another week for statuettes. I wanted that exalted shoulders.
---
Its not cool thats the point. Dumb collections are not on the same lvl as Raid/Fractal CMs
---
I dont get it. This isnt working for me. Im still stuck at 400
---
&gt;PvP  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;content
---
choose one
---
/s but only partly
---
Endless Ocean and New Horizon... Anet why are you doing this to me I don't want to overhype myself again ;-;
---
&gt;As can be seen by trading card games
---
Except out of the big card games, none of them have an official, centralized store for the cards, it's all user markets. Prices fluctuate all the time in these markets, not because of card rarity, but because of card usefulness. It's not uncommon to see mythical tier cards selling cheaper than less rare cards simply because they fit better in the meta. This is a problem that is non-existant in lootboxes with only cosmetic rewards being translated into direct purchases. Usually all items in a "cosmetic tier" are more or less the same in regards to visual appeal, just see how things like league of legends skins are grouped into tiers depending on the quality of the skin. 
---
&gt;By adding an actual chance to earn real money. But according to you, making it more like gambling in a casino, makes it somehow better. Because if you can win real money, all the unhealthy gambling will disappear.
---
I'm almost 100% certain I did not suggest making BLC lootbox cosmetics the center of a player market, or that virtual gambling's cosmetic rewards' problems would be solved by enabling players to sell the digital goods, and instead specifically said "  offering every item in lootboxes as a direct purchases ", which I thought clearly implied this would be Arenanet offering the items for fixed prices.
---
Of all the ways this game could have gone, a crossover with Animal Crossing was not something would have guess. 😝
---
For real though someone get me images of the New Horizons Mount skins pleaaaaase!
---
Good News! https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1166380448135749632
---
Looks like they are on sale now.
---
If you include WvW, one-shot deadeyes are also pretty crazy.
---
Wow! looks great!
---
nor material storage expanders, or crafting licenses, or bag slots..
---
Dunno havent seen any posts about people bored with classic and wanting to play GW2
---
&gt;  I don’t find gw2 facilitates social experiences very well, though not sure why. 
---
For the same reason people are praising GW2 in this thread. Convenience. 
---
In WoW others can take your mobs unless you're both in the same group. This sucks, but there is a workaround - invite them! This also makes the content easier and faster.
---
In GW2 you can just tag the mob then go on your way, no need to interact with the other player.
---
We are literally between a major balance patch and the announcement of a major release. What exactly were you expecting?
---
Underwater content is super niche. Combat with 3 axes feels bad, underwater weapons are insanely uninteresting, and the reworks ANet has done for underwater content have made it a huge grind and goldsink (swimspeed infusions).
---
Improvements made for underwater content only impact a tiny part of the game, when there's a lot bigger and more important part out there that still needs combat as well. A focus on it would alienate a ton of players (including myself) and that's not what ANet needs right now.
---
Isn't the Jade Sea normal by now? We already started seeing (hearing) a reversal of it in Guild Wars: Winds of Change after killing Shiro.
---
I just checked they have not updated the price yet maybe I need to wait.
---
Impressive deduction there, Sherlock
---
took me 13 keys to get the Wings. i feel dirty. 20 bucks for the gems i guess it better then spending it on WoW sub for classic.
---
I got a [Mural of Defeat](https://i.imgur.com/tiNuSam.png). Is there a bigger middle finger? There isn't even a wiki page for it.
---
in a thread called "why player retention matters," gotta run soz
---
New horizons.... I smell boats.
---
Hooray!
---
Wow so more than a month out till next LS.... the cadence better be way quicker.
---
Not using shatters REE
---
Oh I can see that - I've just been reading about how butthurt folks are about the Ascended Aurene stream giveaway. They've not even learned whether it will be a few or all that receive it but they're still furious about it. 🤣
---
Were you expecting something in the dead period after an episode, raid, 2 events, and before their big announcement?
---
Or even normal bag slot expansions
---
It's possible the sales continue next week I suppose
---
LUL
---
Sweet
---
I don't think the two (Elder Dragon theme and investigation/adventure) are mutually exclusive. The devs have already acknowledged that they can't really jump from one world ending threat to the next, and they have already established that S5 will be more focused on racial themes.
---
Anet hasn't worked with him since living world season 1 at the latest. They still use the themes and motifs he wrote for them, but the man himself is not involved.
---
Even if 90% of the people quit classic will be ridiculously more popular than GW2, so let's not act all superior.
---
Will you keep adding rng based gathering?
---
Please stop adding rng gathering, tyvfm.
---
If you mean ascended mats, can totally bypass the timegate with tp.
---
My daddy is a rabbit, my mummy is a jack russel, who am I ? Check the answer with the new springer skin !
---
We got a snorlax skyscale before we got a charizard...
---
I fucking lost it when Deroir popped up with Feminist next to his name.
---
Nice skins. Not going to buy though, sorry.
---
Is the crafting station unlocked for the whole account or only for the characters that have the profession at 425?
---
I'll check them out when they drop. Eidolons and orbs didn't interest me, I think my love for the game just fell out, and I hate it since warframe is so unique. Sanctuary was fun for a bit though definitely. Haven't done arbitration since I couldn't complete the starmaps. *all the wing-space-thingy missions ;-;*
---
agree. still it's a 20 years old game. nothing to write home about
---
&gt;ArenaNet didn't sponsor the Event because they didn't want to promote a 3rd party tool that hacks the client which would say that either they are okay that a streamer uses this (and therefore create favouritism towards partners or streamers) or that because one is okay with this, everyone could also use this.
---
Why are you completely ignoring the fact that
---
A) this is a ***PRIVATELY DEVELOPED TOOL, WITH NO PLANS TO BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC,*** and 
---
B) Just as the partner program has requirements, usage of the tool for sponsored content could also be put under requirements
---
&gt; (and therefore create favouritism towards partners or streamers)  
---
So being a partner has no additional perks with the company you are providing advertising for? What world do you live in? Who under this heavenly sky would EVER want to be a partner without the parent company providing support? Allowing big events like ERP with set requirements to use this tool or CM accounts is no different than providing the ***exact same fucking people*** with free codes for gems or store items for them to do givaways to their audience. 
---
&gt; The quote you took was a step further down the line because if such a tool should make it into the game then the question is on how beneficial it is to the game and how often it actually would get used. For those big events, it is a huge addition to the game but those events don't happen daily. 
---
I'm not sure where you are getting the idea that I'm suggesting arenanet to invest time, money or manhours into implementing the tool into the game? The tool exists and was independently developed, all that is required of them is to treat it as a "big event" tool that will only be used in events that have a bigger than X prize pool, or whatever, just as other esports' tournament realms can only be used in big events and not in your local highschool's weekly tournament. 
---
&gt; I think you don't understand what the whole thing is about. Taco is an overlay that doesn't interfere or messes with the client. The camera tool IS interfering with the client that is why arenanet didn't want to sponsor this event! Taco gives you additional information but doesn't let you change the game itself by controlling the camera. 
---
I do not think YOU understand the point. By taking ERP from a completely community created and managed event into an officially sponsored event, they can actually do whatever the fuck they want with the gameplay in the tournament. It's their game, it's their EULA:
---
They can ***C H O O S E*** to utilize this tool going forward for big events with requirements just as they have for their partners program. Is "BuT tHenN evRyOnE wILl WanT tO bE a ParTNeR" a valid justification for not having a partner program? 
---
They can  ***C H O O S E*** to make it a requirement for the original developer to let them review the code to check it doesn't do anything else than provide a freefloating camera. 
---
They can ***C H O O S E*** to make the original dev sign a contract stating that he will not release the tool publicly or license it for use elsewhere than Anet gives permission to. 
---
nd in the worst absolute case scenario where they just didn't want a 3rd party tool, they could also ***C H O O S E*** to provide a dummy CM account for the event's streamers to "peek" into the players in the tournament, as we know that they are able to do that with CM accounts. 
---
EVERYTHING about this was well under their capacity to control it. Why are you pretending they are held hostage by their own EULA? Anet had 3 options with ERP:
---
\- Sponsor them using their 3rd party private tool and set requirements for this tool's usage.
---
\- Sponsor them by leasing CM accounts to do pretty much everything the 3rd party tool does with the camera.
---
\- Not sponsor them.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
For the last time there are no culinary applications of Bloodstone Dust! Like Taco Bell, you brought this on yourself!
---
Can't say I'm surprised cause the guy always sounded like a major prick, but wonder if this means Anet's gonna purge all his music from the game now
---
naa, just the patch size, will need to wait for shaman for the datamines
---
You guys know you can praise GW2 without shit talking other MMOs?
---
Knife tailed skritts don't drop anything anymore even with the buff active.
---
If it was a Twitch stream or a Youtube video for it, I guess I missed it because YT's algorithm is pretty horrible tbh, and I tend to sleep through most weekend morning/evening streams/streamers because I work nights Thursday through Saturday.
---
Surprisingly got Monk Outfit from Wardrobe Unlock. Probably best thing I got out of BL Chest ever.
---
Skychonk is best boy.
---
You can see them in the mount skin part of your hero panel.
---
One funny thing is I was pondering where to get some stat select gear for my Guardian to mess with Firebrand, but there doesn't yet seem to be a list of stat select gear on the wiki.  Hopefully someone'll put that up somewhere since if I can I'd rather not craft Exotic Viper's stuff.
---
Should be whole account
---
fat man fat man fat man
---
Warclaw in it! Finally a skin quite nice!
---
Looks like just for the ones at 425 cooking, hopped on an alt that didn't have cooking at all to check and didn't see it.
---
&gt;The timegates that I was referring to are things like fractal rewards being capped to daily, raid rewards being capped to weekly, world bosses and meta events having many rewards that are capped to daily, etc. Timegates stop things from becoming farmable to the point where seasoned veterans and no-lifers can grind their way to ridiculous levels, leaving any new player in the dust and/or inflating gold in the process.
---
Ok, I'll rephrase my question: in a game with no vertical progression for the end-game content, how does requiring me, a new player, 2 months of timegating fractal rewards for an ascended item, help me? How is spending the same time it would require me in a couple of days, but staggered over 2+ months to get the ***exact same item*** beneficial to me? I'm REALLY struggling to see what is positive about timegating content that is required to access the more difficult content of the game, instead of just having natural skill barriers.
---
I’ve read your post four times and I still don’t understand what happened. Can you elaborate please?
---
Where are you?
---
it's not about shitting others. it's just the answer to those who had been shitting on gw2 last weeks saying we should have all move to wow classic like all those pro players did , wow classic the next best thing. 
---
no shitting. just straight considering
---
CAMAN SHAMAN
---
Does it unlock on the full account, or just that character or just that race?
---
Is it a full crafting station with bank access?
---
&gt;[&amp;AgGMZgEAAA==] 	Cube Matrix Glider
---
tested ingame.. my eyes.. i think im blind
---
Sale wasn't showing as live yet earlier. Is this discount available now?
---
This is what we get for spoiling them so rotten during the Skyscale Care collection!
---
No season 5 hints. Well played
---
The fact that a 15 year old MMO might just become the most popular MMO on the market again does say a lot about the state of the MMO market though.
---
&gt; A focus on it would alienate a ton of players
---
What if by anet focusing on underwater combat(doesnt have to take a huge amount of resources) they made it better and more enjoyable for everyone? Would that really be so bad?
---
Anyone got screenshots for the stuff please. I miss Dulfy ;(
---
oh, that's sad, i have multiple characters with 400 cooking, since i used it to level up them in the past, and i also would liked to get that station unlocked since i'm trying to get all home instance stuff
---
Nah it's the new vers of Irvine from Berserk ! https://berserk.fandom.com/wiki/Irvine/Image_Gallery?file=Irvine%27s_Apostle_Form.png
---
How did you make the skyscale come out without mounting it?
---
Thank you for adding that clarification! I was unsure on what the exact issue was with Stormblood (hence the iirc) so it is nice to have that added.
---
Cantha confirmed! Why would we need so much food if we are going to travel somewhere close. Ocean map-&gt; because of endless weapons and than.. It's so obvious😀
---
Love your icons!

Im sorry that people that want enganging content dont find it fun to spam 1 one meta bosses and collect nodes for achievement points.
---
&gt; It isn't something that introduces new gameplay
---
it is literally new gameplay. a new way to traverse maps.
---
New.
---
Whys there a fat skyscale lol
---
It’s a GW2 subreddit and you’re posting about the rerelease of a 15 year old game and how amazing GW2 is in comparison. 
---
If anything that’s just pettiness
---
If it turns out like the bubble tea thingy I don't think the thousands of bots and 5 people from NA will mind being spoiled.
---
they deleted the tweet, I hope we still get living world season sales this week or next week.
---
I want to know, their opinion on the state of hardcore Pve, Pvp and Wvw.
---
Are they aware happy with it? Wish they could do better but can't? Or do they share those communities feelings, that they have failed in maintaining those game modes, and are hoping to do better in the future?
---
Wardrobe Unlock -&gt; Classical Glider :&gt;
---
Will there be another raid wing? Will there be an expansion after season 5? Have you continued to work on WVW alliances. Will there be a native dps meter.
---
You’re on a GW2 subreddit posting about another MMO, one which happens to be a 15 year old rerelease. That’s just petty.
---
They look sweet, and you can choose 2 with the new package?
---
Big chunky boi is awesome.
---
Damn blew all my tickets in bioluminescent and endless ocean are way cooler to me
---
And Ellen Kiel will steal them again.
---
The winners of the contest were implemented first, years ago. The contest stipulated that they could use non-winning designs at a later date if they chose.
---
Has arenanet looked into housing or thought of it. Are new elite specs possible in living world season 5?
---
Im doubtful to but I think its something worth while for anet to invest in. If for no other reason than to make it so the majority of the player base doesnt hate it with a passion.
---
We had Serpent’s Ire which was quite difficult, but got nerfed into oblivion recently
---
AH! My eyes my eyes why do they keep doing this crap?!
---
For the love of god please give us Kurzick vs Luxons content(PvE content, maybe even a PvP map?)  !!! Factions was the most sexy add-on of GW1
---
me dont like those skins so ima go downvote the shit out of the guy who previews them! /s
---
Just stay away from open pools of water....and waterfalls...and y'know, rain.
---
A thousand thanks! Really wanted to see them, won't get home till tomorrow.
---
looks more than 50% to me tbh. more like 66ish
---
Can only hope. Living world is the main thing I've been waiting on going on sale.
---
Hopefully. I have a few friends who are new players that are waiting on the seasons to go on sale.
---
Pardon my probable naiveté here, but I can't seem to find anything pertaining to Endless Ocean weapon set. Is this a thing?
---
thats the end of 1h food period, right? because all ascended food is group food? or did I missread something?
---
haven't play the game for a while, for the war claw ( stardust / galxy type of skin) is there select skin out yet ( the higher price one but you get to chose)? I couldn't find it in the gem store. TYVM !
---
And yet im at 435 and Seimur wont take anything ive cooked for him
---
Even worse Mythwright was released on September 18th 2018 and Adashim was released on June 11th, 2019. So more like 9.5 months between releases
---
How are they going to address the current issue that both new/casual and veteran players have with different aspects of the game? For example: raids - too easy for vets, too hard for casuals/nee players. Are they planning a short of tier system like Fractals?
---
Are we going to see a rework of existing content (POF and HOT and vanilla maps)? 
---
How will they manage the need for more content? Seems to be an issue since early 2018, and we are almost in 2020 now.
---
Seriously, during his idle animation, what are we tossing it to eat? Black Forest Cakes?
---
You can just exchange them for unidentified gear once you have all kites. But this trade had to be spammed one after another, so it is possible that now you can trade away all tokens at once.
---
memes for memestrel
---
Too confusing for new playerd
---
It's engaging.  It's something new to collect, something cool to add to the story, new stuff that requires coordination.  CMs don't add much.  It's a one-off thing for AP and then what?  Do you get cool stuff for doing it more?  Does it add layers to the lore or reveal more cool things?
---
FINALLY a karka emblem for my bank guild Karka Parkas!
---
- Casino Coins: I don't want to consume them, I WANT TO STORE THEM!
---
Both of those went on sale last week in July :(
---
I thought it was odd but picked up some bank tabs anyways, figuring there might appear again during the anniv sale.  I shoulda known better.
---
Could also mean a soft launch of GW2 going back to what made GW2 amazing breaking MMO barriers.
---
It’s a nice alternative if you don’t want to crack out 2kGems for the whole Warclaw Skin pack, which is just full of lazy retextures of the base armor. 
---
I don’t even have the dang mount though so why do I even have an opinion. Still working on my Skyscale and then Griffon.
---
I had no idea that was a thing, that sounds super helpful and now I get why I sometimes see one.
---
&gt;66% Chance to Steal Life on Critical Hit  
---
CD?
---
oh lawd he comin
---
True, but then unless you bought the New Horizons pack or are willing to play 1200 gems for a select license, you run the risk of getting a skin you don't want. While many of the Horizon skins are very cool, I wouldn't use most of them as they don't fit any of my themes.
---
You can't actually be as stupid as you're making yourself out to be...right?
---
I see you've elected to completely ignore what I said about lawyer funds also being an issue. If she involved the police, same story, except there are already myriad cases of police downplaying/not properly assisting sexual assault victims. That being said - the outcry against her will still happen, of course, as it is wont to do because people are so obsessed with defending every mediocre man who's made something they love.
---
But with things posted on the internet people can do exactly what you're doing - dismissing it, writing it off, not getting up in arms about someone taking the precious composer of their favorite music into court. If she went about this in an official capacity it would absolutely open the floodgates. As it is I'm sure there are people gearing up to threaten her, doxx her, etc. and it would only be worse if this got even more public.
---
People are more than allowed to come to their own conclusions based on provided evidence and write someone off they think is a piece of shit. No one has to hire him. Only the court system itself is held fast to "innocent until proven guilty". No one has to pay him any mind or attention at all. No one is obligated to do anything for this man, and any companies looking to drop contracts with him because of this will surely launch their own private investigations before they do anything - just as Polygon did with Nick Robinson, just as /any/ company should do.
---
2 hours.. no biggie. They learned from Skyscale.
---
I would upvote but its at 69. :(
---
 \+10% Outgoing Healing+100 Concentration+70 Healing Power : looks like bis for healers I guess
---
 \-10% Incoming Damage+100 Concentration+70 Toughness : new tank food
---
 66% Chance to Steal Life on Critical Hit+100 Power+70 Ferocity : bis power dps food
---
I can't see the upgrade of 66% chance to steal life on critical hit being worth the cost for condi dps, it's effectively a 40% chance to steal some health on each hit for most classes, while on power it's a 66% chance.
---
First of all, this is awesome...
---
Secondly, I'm gonna log my alt account and upvote you again because this reminds me of a scene from my favorite game as a child, [Final Fantasy IX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qGmV-RpHYE&amp;t=1m34s) and the Alexander Eidolon.
---
What happened to her anyway?
---
Regardless of how big or small the task was to make happen, ANet pushing out updates over the past two months that have been seeming direct responses to community asks has been SUPER encouraging.
---
not listed but probably 2 seconds same as omnomberry pie like /u/Zosin said
---
Thank you for compiling this!
---
However, with the mount licenses, you get one New Horizon Select (1200 gems), and one older mount *select* (1200 gems) or a New Horizon *adoption* (random: 400 gems) license. So, it's either 1200+1200 value or 1200+400 value for that section, depending on if you're getting an old select license or a new random license.
---
Okay thanks!
---
Have you search for [Recovered Black Lion Goods](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Recovered_Black_Lion_Goods) in your inventory?
---
You can CHOOSE 1 skin from the New Horizons, and then you can select either a Mount Select License (meaning you pick the skin) from the earlier License packs (Distant Lands, et al) OR you get 1 random skin from the New Horizons.
---
Maybe we get personal boats/ships instead of mounts.
---
To me, the one on the right looks more like Taylor Swift or maybe they are both Taylor. 
---
I really like your work especially the Mindflayer, the girl on the train/in diner (can't tell where she is sitting) and the Guildwars artwork is really beautiful as well. 
---
Well done!
---
Btw consider adding a little bit of text to your main page on your website explaining what type of services you offer like "Professional concept illustrator available for your next project.' Basically, add some sort of call to action. 
---
Also list what industries you target like gaming or TV/Film, or board games, mobile projects etc. (If you need some help let me know.). 
---
Your portfolio is great but you need to convey how your services can solve a company's problem. Your site currently has no information about why someone should hire you for a gig except talent, but there are also a ton of talented artists out there as well. 
---
Anyway thanks for sharing your work!
---
Rockstar! :-)
---
Mine showed up as soon as I hit 425. Is your mailbox full?
---
Apparently RL career
---
That’s right! I accidently wrote the 1600 in my conclusion, edited to 2400 because I wanted to present the maximum return you could get on your drops. Thanks for pointing that out! o/
---
I can't help but feel slightly miffed that they've effectively announced the name of the new LW Episode in the Supply Drop rather than a proper announcement (seriously guys, you couldn't keep it in your pants for one more week?), but oh well. Based on the previous Supply Drop we can probably expect the new Episode on the 17th, maybe sooner if we're lucky, so there's another reveal spoiled. At least it's a form of monetization I'm pretty OK with - no unique rewards, reasonable price, and interesting items.
---
Ascended cooking is an interesting idea, can't wait to see how it pans out. Hopefully it will lead to some interesting new possibilities and not end up just being a new resource sink. Can't wait to see what other stuff they have in store for us on the 30th; a pity it will be in the middle of the work day for me.
---
Heard she was focusing on her actual career.
---
I have, nothing there! I’ve still got the buffs too
---
at most a 157.5 DPS increase over butternut isn't worth IMHO.  The gain health every second is probably better because higher scholar uptime, honestly
---
Well this is just a random patch, not a major update
---
For people that actually spend time learning the combat system it creates a dynamic gameplay loop that rewards you for actually playing well when the difficulty matches the rewards. You dont get this from open world because everything is so face roll i can finish it quite literally with a hand on my dick.

tweet got deleted it seems

777 flashbacks of my lost dad!
---
fucking hell i just spent an hour killing mobs thinking it was the way they were meant to work
---
I agree, they look fantastic. 10/10
---
What I am reading is "I don't care that they changed X for all future people I just care that it impacts me."
---
Seems to be bugged, multiple people have the same issue.
---
&gt; GW2 is the biggest offender.
---
They say 2 days after literally the biggest community event in GW2 history.
---
Man that’s annoying, thanks for the heads up!
---
derp... thank you :)
---
THE BATTOUSAI!
---
Confirmed that Season 5 will have achievements
---
They can add on to the story though. Maybe it’s other fire too - Braham broke the tooth with an enchanted bow that used fire magic that didn’t come from primordus. Or at the very least they don’t necessarily have to involve primordus himself, but maybe an artifact from him. Since I imagine primordus will get his own plot later
---
LOVE the Rock raptor!
---
i think that'd be the barest minimum
---
Not exactly new knowledge given all the Svanir updates lately, but the supply drop banner shows mountains and Norn architecture.
---
Also, completely spitballing, but the mini brown bear cub is kind of random.
---
What do they smell like?
---
The whole point of wanting more content is the combat dude, what are you talking about. You do know that there is a vast difference between combat in Raids/Fractals and PvP right? And no you cant because Anet updates pvp even less than Raids
---
Gem to gold if u plan to buy your first gen legendary
---
The Jackal sees a treat down there.
---
Ugh the wait for mid-September is gonna be rougher than this one!
---
They look iike a cross between Pact and ice weaponry. There are way too many ice/blue blc skins and in game in general. How about some Dragon themed sets or more Ninja weapons, or something else we haven't seen yet.
---
Because it was hated on. However Anet probably never checked why, they focused on that it happened. Who cares, it was due to the fact of bajillion bugs they weren't fixing fo years and even to this day this instance can bug nastily?
---
They did say season 5 will not have a world ending threat. So I think most of the episodes could be norn lore besides jormag, and learning about jormag whilst he’s still asleep. The whole season may not be all about him either, idk
---
Skritt Bonds and Supply Drops are the greatest thing for completionists and gemstore collectionists since the Wardrobe Unlock.
---
I mean, she stole the Aetherblade's ship, so why not these ones?
---
It just means you pour resources into something that doesnt bring returns. Which drove a wedge between anet and many of their fans and accelerated the deaths of these gamemodes because of misalocating the few resources that go into it. 
---
Agreed that difficulty levels are less disruptive than warclaw, if done well. If rewards for the higher levels are too bad compared to the easier ones itd kill off whatever is left. LFR type stuff has detrimental effects unless done alongside good difficulty levels and a few other things to allow raids to LFR'd. That's a lot of resources on the assumption that they wont half ass give lfr raids. If they do rewards like wvw or pvp then despite the resources, rip of raids.
---
Considering that means 157 health per second in lifesteal that's already twice as powerful as mango pies.
---
The merging is complete.
---
Video’s unavailable
---
you still gain health from this one aswell cause you steal health. Mango pie is normal food that gives health and gives 85 healing per second unaffected by healing power. So assuming you proc the life steal on cooldown the healing is better compared to the gain health every second food (assuming healing done is same as mango pie)
---
Don't. The game is a in a very bad state and major streamers are leaving the game. Save your money
---
So you get **both** a New Horizon Select *and* older Mount Select License for sure? or the later is either that *or a New Horizon adoption one?*
---
just checking if I got this right.. it seems that the whole deal is worth it and was considering buying it
---
Amazing mace skin.
---
Oof I feel that Charr struggle. I don’t use the Jackal often but had to for some Skyscale collection stuff Last night and even my arguably slight Charr looked soooo silly on the poor little guy. 
---
I would really love the Warclaw eventually just for my Charr, cause his entire theme is cats. Cat pet. Cat minipet. Would be great for him to have a cat mount lol. But that’s much much later in my schedule since it would pretty much just be a vanity thing for him.
---
These are so much more expensive for a very minor gain, it's almost as if they wanted the food to be very niche.
---
WE'RE GOING NORTH! TO STEVE!
---
So these effectively give 5% less XP in OW, but give a total of 15% XP in WvW?
---
No endurance increasing food :(
---
It's a great food to have for WvW like Bowl of Orrian Truffle and Meat Stew.
---
I had high hopes of finally getting a pretty blue staff to go with Ad Infinitum, after seeing the official ad picture with the sword skin.
---
And there it is. A dominantly green skin among a set of beautiful, mostly blue weapons.
---
I swear Arenanet has something against purplish blue staves. And they have a weird thing for making every blue skin bend towards cyan or turquoise shades.
---
How is it in a bad state?
---
Video on Guardian Spirt Weapons Reverted = reverted
---
Mirage, Berserker, Deadeye
---
On most condi builds you'll easily proc the lifesteal off CD outside of like trailblazer chrono.
---
Cantha?
---
woooooooooooooooosh
---
What other people are doing is irrelevant. I just came back myself after years and the game has been amazing and there's so much stuff to do, this game is easily the best MMO on the market by miles.
---
Why would a company ever pour resources into something that doesn't bring returns? Even if the game mode dies (which I think would be tragic), it doesn't affect their bottom line. We either need to present a way for raids to be comparably profitable to open world or accept their decline
---
When I bought the War Eternal pack, I chose a select license, so effectively got 2 select licenses out of the 1st drop, which alone are worth 2400gems. Everything else was essentially bonus at that point.
---
Interesting that in the final drop you get a Golden Black Lion Chest Key.  That's a new addition compared to War Eternal.
---
Your last paragraph is just false though. Open world gets new high quality releases every 3-4 months, plus festivals and events. Meanwhile raids come every 9 months, and apart from the Warclaw WvW/PvP haven't received anything notable for far longer than that.
---
As for the rest, what's the incentive in alleviating issues in game modes that very few people play? You say it makes the game as a whole more profitable with nothing to back that up. If raids got more releases, will raiders spend more on the gem store than the entirety of the open world community? My guess is a hard no.
---
Let’s not bring her work into her claim. That has nothing to do with the allegation...
---
Irrelevant to the fact that the item linked by OP is not an art book.
---
r/BreadStapledToTrees
---
Yeah but I'm used to it. Back in WoW my favorite characters were either a Tauren or Draenai, so being too large for mounts is a thing.
---
My Charr uses the Axe Jaw skyscale skin because they both have similar jaw lines :D
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Axejaw_Skyscale_Skin
---
bugged for me too
---
My guess it that they changed them to generic mobs that dont give exp so ppl cant rally of them....thing is tho....those mobs also cant drop loot by default.
---
gg anet
---
Dmg reduction is nice on some bosses like Desmina or something. Also for handkiting.
---
Husks are easily handled by condi builds and blocking eggs is foolproof with guard, mesmer or rev. Timing is also very predictable.
---
oh hey, actual guild content on guild wars
---
~One of these things is not like the other~
---
I did just finish the Amnoon casino blitz and noticed that when I killed troublemakers, the knife tail gang spawned as friendly NPCs, gg all round
---
you could buy loot boxes for them but that was a event for last week
---
You're even carrying all the knives with you!
---
Technically less when you kill mobs but more for event exp since it is universal
---
so we have a lot of spoiled broth now?
---
OH GOD my eyes!!! WHY WHY ANET!
---
What was the exact wording of the "PVE content that doesnt suck"- guy again? That would be a good meme. (Also you will be thrown out the venue.)
---
Hmm ... extinguisher of flames, bringer of peace?
---
Or, option 3: it's subjective. Also, the actual artistic quality of these is no higher than any previous ones.
---
I mean, considering the new material is likely going to involve Jormag and Steve, it makes sense.
---
yeah, i made globs of gelatin and am now at level 490, will get the last 10 levels when my cooking ware is ready at reset and i finish the collection
---
&gt; here are some new emblem designs.
---
From 2015 no less.
---
So long as we find Cantha on the way!
---
0 information from Dulfy. Not a single post. "People" say that it's career and RL stuff.
---
Your title is only a little awkward, not gore at all! 
---
&gt; I forgot what a huge change was not stealing targets in gw2
---
Generally in English this sentence would be structured:
---
&gt;I forgot what a huge change not stealing targets was in gw2
---
More generally:
---
&gt;I forgot what [thing I forgot] was
---
You can chose one and get the option to pick a second, random skin or select one from the old sets.
---
are you discovering lvl 400 recipes or crafting recipes in the crafting panel that are colored orange?
---
&gt;  could say it was fun, but that wouldn't really be true.
---
that's the point. 
---
never more.
---
Agreed with pdps dgh. With its high dps and lithany, it can survive fairly well, it has both ranged and melee wpns on its main pdps build, as well as f2 condi clear+movement and f3 projectile block+aegis. Its pdps rotation is very easy too. Ive only tried cdps on wvw wall defense, where it wrecks groups that stand on their siege way easier than glass weaver (they also mightve been lacking condi clear, but the burn from scepter 2 and sword is pretty insane on groups)
---
Gotta make the commander a bookworm first before they can save the world.

"Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns™—Deluxe Upgrade—50% Off"
---
So what is the actual price for this?  If you go to the [webpage](https://buy.guildwars2.com/store/gw2/en_US/html/pbPage.heartofthorns/) for Heart of Thorns it shows a standard edition for $30 and doesn't show a deluxe edition.  My sister has been waiting on a sale of HoT as PoF has already had multiple sales.
---
it salvages into "flat" and "bread"
---
Maybe unlock those first before using it? 
---
Inb4 ain't nobody got time for that, but if you did it, then you won't get shit unlocks right ;)
---
Are those story dungeons able to be solo'ed or would I need people helping me? I didn't start playing till PoF and been on a break right now but I wanna play em
---
&gt;scended food should be more expensive, because it is a feast
---
I don't really get why there isn't non-feast versions.
---
It's sad that this was a better post than your first.
---
I...don't think we have the same thing in mind. I was thinking more like [this](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/en/uploads/forum_attachment/file/210633/Untitled.jpg), not something out of a BDSM pain dungeon of knives and scares.
---
So a joke:
---
What is the 1st word Balthazar had to say to grab Lyssa's attention, when he asked her for the mirror?
---
"&gt;!Lyssen...!&lt;"
---
&gt; Although it makes sense to plant seeds before fertilizing or watering, the order you complete the collection items does not matter.
---
Rip immersion
---
If you buy the 2400 package you can choose 1 mount from the distance land pack and a choice between random distance land mount or select 1 mount from any other older mount pack.
---
So you get  1 distance land mount of your choice and 1 random one or 1 distance land and 1 from any other mount pack.
---
Oh yes i see him, i edited the op to be more clearer, i'm just curious if it is a bug or maybe we we really need to buy the plot to unlock said achievement
---
Honestly, as long as they kept their mobile game and MMO separate (No linking or special items crossing over) I'd be fine with it. Like, if it were just a different game set in the same (or a different) universe that'd be cool.
---
Teamplay vs. singleplayer.
---
Pardon my tone, but who gives a flying fuck what a streamer says or does? Like seriously, they are just streaming whatever gets them money.
---
It seems to happen when you go up or down on a hill.
---
thank you for the write up!! very interesting
---
I grew very fond of [wardrobe unlock analyzer](http://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/) after I got an iron sword in a similar way :'D
---
Depends on the mob. This quest mob is probably like 5-15 minutes. But there are rare spawns in the game (some of which are highly desirable hunter pets) that have respawn times in the 6-12 hour range.
---
You can craft some Seed Pouches with the new cooking reciepes at 475 to get some of the new materials. I guess the more generic pouches that are only available for the Gemstore one.
---
They made GW2 so that they'd not have to do that kind of thing again. They said it was too taxing making a new game from scratch every time they wanted to expand it.
---
It is a bit tiresome though, people continually throwing out the “Cantha!” comments.
---
when the lean hits you
---
it's not "bugged". they changed them so you can't rally from them - so they removed xp gain for killing them, automatically making them not drop loot. whatever dev did this was just not thinking.
---
Trash developers. Working as intended.
---
The negativity on this sub is insane.
---
Similarly, mega servers.
---
I used to do Teq everyday with the same group on my server. You had to get there early or else you'd get booted to an overflow. As a result, there was map chat, getting to know people, inside jokes, etc.
---
Then mega servers made it easier to make sure everyone got a populated map that could kill Teq (which is good!) but coordinating the old group (trying to get  everyone into the same map) became nearly impossible and the group just sort of went away. 
---
Now, I basically kill bosses with a new set of random people every night. I don't pay attention to names because it's unlikely I'll ever see them again.
---
sometimes i think that the last april fools website they made that looked like underwater, was actually a real tease for the third and final expansion lol. i do hope i will be right about that in like 3 years
---
You sound like me. Play new content when it comes put then back to grinding dailies.
---
Ah ok . Much better in your way actually.
---
Ty for teaching me
---
I'm kinda surprised that they didn't make a clear new BiS power food (with "while moving" bonus, or +200 on kill. Lifesteal food isn't quite there) but made such a powerful healing food. 
---
Becuase I could have expected such power food to be used on fractal runs/raids (or even on world bosses/metas), but how are you going to utilize healing food feast, if there are at best two healing classes in the squad? And probably zero in the openworld.
---
Skyscale is a hefty chonk
---
Id be so excited for the new Skyscale Skin on the license... IF I WHERENT STILL TRYUING TO FARM CURRENCY FOR THE COLLECTION...O\_O
---
Forced community effort but poorly implemented. Still not as horrible as scribing.
---
I just started playing this game.  Level 1-15 area had plenty of people in it.  Im sure (hope) the higher level stuff is just as, if not more, populated.  Loving the game so far btw
---
The truth in their patches is insane :(
---
there's way cheaper ways to get -10% dmg reductiong food
---
It's because the dungeon team wrote them in spagetti code and so once they all left or were fired, nobody dared touch them for fear of breaking them forever.
---
When i say plenty, i mean the heart areas where you kill/fix stuff all had 4-5 people doing same content i was.  Mini boss pop up and there was at least 4 other people each time.  One event there was 10 of us
---
I think they said it also sets down a tray for everyone to use, so it'd be excellent in WvW
---
It's been 4 months now, she should just post an update on her site that she'll be gone for a while. Less confused players and less of these threads. /u/Dulfy
---
i would call that a bug   but whatever  they are working on it.
---
Looks like Phoenix Shoes, Profane Pants, Spearmarshal's Vestments, Revered Shrine Guardian Ears...
---
Light armour fashion wars is the best.
---
Raids, PvP and WvW are another story entirely. They would all benefit from changes to land combat for example, and only extremely slightly from water combat.
---
Underwater isn't a separate mode. It's a tiny part of open world.
---
Only 30% for lws3? :(
---
Lowest recorded was 50%. The tweet is still up in @GuildWars2_DE
---
Thanks for posting from all of us checking reddit on our phones at work :)
---
The game pumps out a crazy amount of free content without a sub fee of course they are going to update the gem store frequently it’s their main source of income from existing players. They just added level 500 cooking in the same patch which is pretty big for the game and I imagine it requires a fair amount of game time to get setup.
---
What's hard with separating the artist and their work? It's been known for years that Soule is an asshole, doesn't change the fact he makes some of the best music in the industry.
---
explain champs to me ease. I see this in chat all the time
---
And now his life is going to forever change because someone posted on a blog instead of involving the police...
---
2019 sucks.
---
Fuck the guy if its true but I'm sick of all these online accusations ruining people.
---
And what if he is innocent?
---
Actually, with the way media extrapolates shit like this, even just an accusation has long standing effects. Just look at last year's Mr Olympia, they originally wanted to kick him out of the competition just because of an accusation. Even years later, google searches will yield results with "just an accusation". I agree with you, but come on, accusations mean A LOT these days, to people's reputations.
---
i hope they make a frosty skyscale next time, i collect those skins
---
this one looks cool too
---
Fair enough, congrats on having been more informed than I.
---
The article literally states that the mount skins can be purchased normally next week.
---
I like quite a few of these, but blessed skychonk, oof I need him.
---
Not all heroes wear capes; thanks!
---
The mount skins will be available soon, but yes, rng and time-gating sucks
---
Get ready to learn some new new rotations bub.
---
well, i wouldnt want to make a PSA that food is now salvageable because it might spoil it for some. 
---
But some might be interested in knowing this before they actually craft their own composter in order to stock up on some cheap food
---
Although I don't necessarily agree with how harsh WoW is with it's older features, I definitely think GW2 could benefit from a little less convenience\QoL here and there. I feel for the devs when they have this beautiful world they've created and people just kind of zoom by without noticing all the great things bc so much of the open world stuff is pretty brain dead gaming (see WoodenPotatoes No Skill Challenge). However, I respect their commitment to staying true, as much as they can to their vision and doing some really great stuff, that people do take for granted at times. Luckily, should they decide to go this alternate route I think it's relatively "fixable" with additional new content, especially if they're going to old maps on S5. Although, I'm sure convenience is a great source of profit for them, with BLTC items so we'll see. Overall though, as a more casual player Gw2 is the best thing going on, and let's not forget it's like 3 or 4 games balled into one, depending on how you look at it.
---
What?
---
Tasty.
---
ez powercreep
---
Hmm how did you get the varietal seeds? I've been gathering for over an hour now.
---
I already got it. Didn't have any better way to spend my gold anyway.  It's gem wise super worth it. All the vouchers and other selection items already have a set value in gems.
---
I've lost absolutely nothing by buying it. I'll see Friday if I'll continue playing though.
---
Isn't that just a Skritt's face?
---
yes, and? we knew that this was gonna bring some powercreep since the blog post a week or so ago.
---
We meet again.

Many hearts have events on them that act as the quest chain. 
---
The chain in WoW is: farm over-run by bandits, kill a bunch, run back, collect a bunch of grapes from the ground, run back, go kill the boss, run back. Lots of dead time.
---
The equivalent event in GW2 would be: Quest giver shouts "Hey I need your help here, bandits have overrun the farm! follow me!" at a player, the players start the chain and escort the giver to the farm. An event starts to drive off waves of bandits until the farm is cleared. There is a collection event to bring grapes back to the giver. The giver then leads the charge to face off vs the bandit leader. All events scale with player count. Each part of the chain gives you a decent amount of heart credit.
---
The GW2 way is much more interactive and fun than WoW as far as quest lines and world feels more alive and dynamic for it.
---
it seems the rarity of the salvaged nourishment extract depends on the level of the food, so lvl 80 for exotic extracts, low/mid level food for blue/green and I used lvl 70 food for rare extracts.
---
The mintberry swirl ice cream  from wintersday gifts is a pretty cheap source of the exotic extracts, I am sure there is more cheap festival food from WD and Halloween to stock up your mat storage
---
I wanna see how this works.
---
Got mine at the Gendarran Fields farm
---
It's still unlikely that we're going underwater. If we were, wouldn't they give this set underwater weapons? And if we are, I'm quitting the game for sure anyway so no need to learn the rotations (even though they're already faceroll compared to regular, actual good combat).
---
The right too
---
Uhhh, don't you need to wait until daily reset to get the Ascended Cookware? He told me to come back in a day.
---
i am mass salvaging festival food atm
---
&gt; But some might be interested in knowing this before they actually craft their own composter in order to stock up on some cheap food
---
I'm looking forwards to Halloween and Wintersday
---
Always uninstall ARC after a patch. If ARC gets patched it'll work fully again.
---
ok, a 150 DPS increase.  That's is basically nothing
---
That's lame. At least a lvl 60 scroll would've been nice.
---
in-game day 2hours
---
The information came originally from her discord, posted by the guy who admins her site.
---
Feels weird that she was apparently such a huge part of many mmo communities and never found the time to just tell people that she will not have the time to do the guide stuff anymore.
---
Oh, phew. I thought the norn chef meant "daily reset", not "next in-game day".
---
Same here. We have to wait for the dev update.
---
For once, a gem store set with the same theme as raid weapons that *doesn't* look better than the raid ones! (Largos' Greatbow &amp; Swiftblade)
---
you allrdy found out what its for?
---
I'm not seeing it.  More combat is only updated when we get new elite specs, otherwise it's the same combat in a different locale.  I'm interested in new things for my characters, new places for my characters, new lore for new characters, to build new stories and have a good time in new places, with juicy, fun ideas.  The fights in between are just the barrier between my characters and sweet, cool things that bring out who they are.
---
Was really expecting them to be more mechanical
---
Also ensures Scholar uptime
---
I disagree about "evil."  Evil would be to require this supply drop in order to play the next chapter of the story (forced monetization).  
---
What you're seeing/explaining is just your desire to get the chest without paying for it.  You don't "need" anything in here, its purely cosmetic.  Its your CHOICE to buy it.
---
I agree with one thing though - its lame that the skins aren't available as a game achievement and only available in the loot boxes.  Very lame.
---
I got mine from Sandswept Isles, it's full of nodes to gather there.
---
maybe give delta more than 2.5h to have a chance at actually updating arc for the new game build?
---
well this composter will be a welcome item to get rid of all that food fast and easy instead of destroying it
---
none of these ingredients are useful. Cooking 500 is no where near difficult to reach.
---
Heal builds would use 10% healing / 100 healing / 70 conc usually. Could allow druid to slot in more magi for a marginal health increase.
---
Damn, so much cool stuff for those with money
---
It's busted, same with damage reduction. I don't see why this better-than-grandmaster-traits food is allowed here.
---
after all the hours I poured into GW2, I definitely do not want any sequels
---
Weird, I cleared that earlier. I guess I will gather a little more and cross my fingers.
---
Like i said, you can literally do the same with other classes, the only thing you're missing is quickness.
---
Why harder? It's way easier and faster to skip stuff with stealth than running through it with DHs. I legit can't remember the last time I did CM or Arah without a thief, that would be so aids. Optimal dungeon comp would be something like Thief (where stealth is needed), Sb (frost spirit and ridiculous dmg), at least one guardian for quickness and signet share (you use bane signet everywhere instantly either way) also stab is sometimes nice, and some random DDs (weaver/sb/dh, probably in this order). Warrior is probably not worth it since you lose more damage by losing a DPS than you gain with the banners, alacrity is not needed since everything dies in seconds anyway.
---
Damage Reduction food is ANET passively scaling down damage in WvW.  Seriously, I use it on pretty much every character except my Medi Scrapper :/
---
[yeah](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/91786-Exquisite-Extract-of-Nourishment)
---
The one class you can play decent is the highest burst.
---
more like 'DiaBLOAT'
---
&gt;  We live in a dreadful times to be a successful white male
---
I mean it's as easy as not raping people
---
lmao i'm the last person to defend anet. that food was a bad investment. something needed to be done about it eventually. you can't complain about anet finally (sort of) fixing a problem for once
---
I guess what I'm trying to confirm is that the 10% experience you see on regular food means +10% XP in any game mode (PvE or WvW), while these new foods have WvW only XP boosts.
---
The Supply Drops usually do though. So I thought it odd that the mount package with the same name as the supply drop was so all over the place.
---
I didn't mean it that seriously though.
---
That thing is UG-LEE. Looks like Diablo ate his brothers.
---
Won't happen. The Kurzicks and Luxons were already absorbed due to the Ministry of Purity (aka, overzealous nut jobs).
---
Bronach, the brother of Canach.
---
what does your incoherent ramblings have to do with the fact this token character isn't the least bit interesting? Or did you miss my critique pointing out they are uninteresting because their sole trait isn't challenged? God what a stupid thing to froth at the mouth over, lmao.
---
Since she never took a second of her time to update anything on her site I just assumed she was in prison.
---
Sounds like the mint parsley sauce, or components thereof.
---
It's possible to convert 3D models to voxels one wouldn't even need to actually build it.
---
So the plants will probably grow some timegated material with that you can maybe craft the new food?
---
No, I have raided.  I don't much anymore because...why?  Raiding isn't fun, but wandering around after is.  Fighting for five minutes, Dodge this circle, Dodge that square, stack here, rushrushrush no time to care about the scenery.
---
Really, just put a boss in a square box since the lore doesn't matter at all.  Why design the Nightmare fractal to be awesome if you're just gonna pianoplink through the rotation that never changes from boss to boss?  No, the lore IS the fun part.  But people want to ignore it.
---
To those of you silently brigading every comment made in support of the victim: come talk on an even playing field instead of hiding behind downvotes. I'm not sure what's so heinous to you about pointing out the glaring flaws in the US legal system and the internet's general mindset towards victims, but clearly it bothers you enough to systematically go through every single reply to OP. Maybe come talk about it.
---
I somehow managed to get the newly brought back Black Lion Exclusives Chest with that free key so that was a nice surprise today.
---
Luckily a good sign.
---
Maybe Cantha is now under water...cuz climate change and stuff.
---
If that was actually the case why isnt there a large community of people going back to gw1 especially during the 9+ month content deadzone for end fame content if its actually only nostalgia. Dont you think that maybe its because people are actually having fun with a game that requires real player interaction
---
Ice Cream Base has 10 recipes as well.
---
Like I've been saying, Charr vs. Asura space race.
---
I just hit LVL 80 as a ranger. This is the first time I've ever reach max level on a MMO. Can anyone give me advice on how to start gearing myself / what to look for? Should I craft it myself, or is it just easier to buy it off the market for example? Any help is appreciated
---
I fkn hate this requisition shit that started with season 4 episode 6. Such a blatant crash grab, just tell us that the next patch is in 3 weeks, stop with this packages where 80% of the items I dont want. I will use my credit card in items I want, stop making people spend their money on items they wont use.
---
A better question though, is what was the design intent? What were they trying to accomplish?  Was it just to get Cooking from 400 to 500?  Or was there a real need / player desire for access to more feasts, especially given many new players won't bother investing the mystic coins necessary to unlock existing feast recipes?
---
I don't have an answer, and I'm fairly sure I won't be a heavy user of these feasts.  But even in a Raid environment, how many Power DPS do you have vs. Condi DPS and Healer Support?  Wouldn't you need at min 3 feasts put out to cover 10 players?  How efficient is that?
---
Every food item from Box of WvW Supplies can be crafted, except for Koi Cake. Anything that is craftable!
---
Well, every other fire mount is from the license.  I can see it.
---
Well then that’ll be my Wintersday gift to myself. Hopefully I’ll have the damn dragon by then! Just gotta grind for that bloody saddle now.
---
I assume these feasts are not designed for casual use, instead for things like CMs, progression, or records.
---
&gt;while moving bonus
---
No please. I'd rather not go back to seaweed salad days.
---
ah, the ancient lost ninja weapons.
---
So probably some rebels hiding in the forests and on some islands, probably no release in China tho
---
Anet has decided on a pvp event, everything is underwater combat 50/% of the time!
---
99 and 100 cm are very well designed instances Anet refuses to make more bc the majority playerbase cant handle anything outside of unfailable living story mission. The lore is a joke bc living story episodes are for the most part unoriginal and uninteresting
---
lol'd harder than expected.
---
I always laugh at the DE, as it is as if ANET decided to take the most hated spec from MMO PvP (the stealth thief) and the most hated spec from FPS PvP (the sniper) and dump them into the mystic forge with some elonian wine and BAM: out comes the Deadeye.
---
so you basically also get bank access there too, can other people use it aswell?
---
Okay, I guess imagining that LGBT people are actually, well, people must be tough for you if you think our opinions being expressed is frothing.
---
Have a nice life!
---
to throw a wrench in that ...
---
lv25 strawberry pies feast and lv24 lemon bar feast give different results
---
Not sure, theoretically they should be able to.
---
Just went to the old route I used for vanilla in Mount Maelstrom ... well I was going to but the first node dropped the item :p
---
That's a huge help, thanks
---
hype revived, now this might mean we gonna get overworld trident?
---
Filet of Sous-Vide Meat + Divinity Fair Herbs + Sawgill Mushrooms + ??? is a 500 recipe
---
&gt; gamemode X: we'd like some actual content
---
&gt; anet: randomly releases a niche feature with some very obviously controversial design choices
---
&gt; gamemode X: that seems a bit odd and could use some improvements
---
&gt; rando white knights: OMG, YOU ASKED FOR CONTENT. YOU GOT IT, AND NOW ALL YOU DO IS COMPLAIN, GAMEMODE X SURE CAN NEVER BE PLEASED.
---
anyone else getting warclaw etc. PTSD?
---
Same thing happened to me. Had one before today. Got a free one from the collection. Bought the 3rd and activated it. Last garden plot filled in with dirt, but no nodes. Re-entered home instance and 3rd plot reset. No dirt or nodes.
---
If the life-steal is like other food, then it's going to have a 2s ICD, so it'll be 100-200 DPS boost at best.  Not really much worth worrying about IMO.
---
Nope, the poster originally stated that the issue was easy enough to overcome simply by grouping up. They appear to have edited their post heavily, without noting they have done so as issues with their original simplification were pointed out.
---
&gt; then really GW2 is just a single player RPG with a MM lobby.
---
If enough people would enjoy it and pay for it, then what's the problem?
---
No.
---
Well the composter is obviously to provide a sink for all the cheap food clogging up the TP ...
---
Got mine from the first Herb node i gathered in Caledon Forest.
---
Bubbles next dragon, Jormag was a red herring!
---
Does anyone know if these skins have a "trail" similar to the Branded Black Lion Weapon skins released a while ago?
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted. No matter how useful here work was, she stopped overnight and didn't bother writing a single word to tell the communities that she stopped. I don't think it's nice.
---
What's wrong with *you*? Making it more about gender than a lie.
---
Who the HELL uses a focus as a main hand?? I doubt these are for build templates.
---
They're identical instead
---
My point is though that if theyre going to be expensive you probably wont use them outside of speed kills and record runs. In these instances you want as much dmg as possible and if you can run without dmg reduction then there is no point in taking them
---
Are they actually going to be in the API soon? Out of curiosity. The gryphon one y'all added recently still isn't there.
---
I mean... it's not trying to fix anything? It's just standardizing cooking to level 500 and adding an ascended food with it (like ascended armor/weps for other profs). I don't think there was any illusion that this is fixing the game, it's just kinda an addition that's 'nice'.
---
Internet accusations don’t need to be true or accurate for someone to get blacklisted nowadays.
---
GW2 with resetting dailies and time gates inherently does not respect your time, if it did those sorts of things would accumulate. They are not meant to be bonuses, they're meant to slow you down and/or manipulate you into doing those chores more frequently.
---
Also in GW2 you can have 20 people appear for an event, say nothing, then pop on their mounts and blast off 100 feet in the instant it's over and give you an 'alone in a crowd' feeling.
---
Different strokes for different folks, some people want a world where people interact with each other and have a community, there's nothing wrong with that.
---
Everything is a compromise I suppose, this is what's on the opposite end of the photo in the OP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwd0lbB1XBI
---
For me I enjoy guardian, warrior, ranger, and engineer the most.  Mainly guardian norn, just feels really cool. 
---
Elite specs are unlocked by collecting hero points after maxing out the core skills, which hitting level 80 gives enough for.
---
Same, already got 2k of the Exquisite Extract of Nourishment. I doubt i'll need anymore.
---
[Here](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/db/search?rarity=Ascended&amp;type=Consumable&amp;sub-type=Food) is the "New Item" Tracker from gw2bltc.
---
I filtered it by ascended food and sorted it by age.
---
Any newly crafted asc food item will appear here with its recipe a little bit after its discovery in game.
---
Cultivated seeds are the ones you grow yourself yes ?
---
Is that a Molten Camel Dragon?
---
1 hour
---
&gt; Who the HELL uses a focus as a main hand??
---
what does that have to do with anything? nobody here claimed anyone is or will be suing focus as a main hand.
---
Emm possibly but that means a 2 classes are getting the same weapon elite spec because theres 7 here. Just for fun lets try to guess who gets what. Pistol maybe warrior, Spear Guardian (paragon possibly), Short bow emm Engi they got 2 melee weapons with the last two elite specs, emm scepter theif and revenant possibly a ritualist elite specs, Harpoon gun mesmer, mace necro, land trident possibly ele. But so people don't think I agree they could be build template stuff.
---
Thats obviously fistweapon /s
---
Don't give me hope.
---
Revenant. Ninja in heavy armor and two swords (Power Herald build). 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
---
Yeah, we don't have elite specs with scepters, pistols, maces, or focuses so they definitely fit perfectly in with new specs.  Really interesting that they have tridents, spear guns, and spears there too.
---
I've been touched by an old man twenty years ago when i was a child, please give me attention, here's an printscreen of an email which i've done in paint
---
Thankfully we have dungeons! If anything dungeons are still the best for map breaking :)
---
The only fractal I have not managed any progress at all with map breaking is Siren's Reef. Littered with invisible walls, only thing I've managed to do is to leap over the first gate and there's nothing you can do after that.
---
There's no dagger on those icons, Trident-&gt;speargun-&gt;scepter-&gt;pistol-&gt;mace-&gt;spear-&gt;focus.
---
Firebrand can be used to tank and is quite good if you know what you are doing,but you will need to get some minstrels pieces of gear to give yourself some toughness, so you aggro the boss, and overall tankiness to help you survive better
---
What's the Glob of Gelatin recipe?
---
oh dangit I just bought S2
---
Trident, 
---
Harpoon Gun, 
---
???Scepter???
---
Pistol
---
???Mace???
---
Spear
---
???Focus???
---
I have a feeling that trident will be for Warrior elite spec; ya know, gladiator theme, specifically  [Retiarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retiarius)
---
But I DO HOPE AND PRAY that the trident will go to Elementalist elite spec.
---
**Retiarius**
---
A retiarius (plural retiarii; literally, "net-man" in Latin) was a Roman gladiator who fought with equipment styled on that of a fisherman: a weighted net (rete (3rd decl.), hence the name), a three-pointed trident (fuscina or tridens), and a dagger (pugio). The retiarius was lightly armoured, wearing an arm guard (manica) and a shoulder guard (galerus). Typically, his clothing consisted only of a loincloth (subligaculum) held in place by a wide belt, or of a short tunic with light padding. He wore no head protection or footwear.

---
why make the assuming that you get the most expensive items from the random things? lol
---
*points to calendar* oh look it's tuesday
---
The one after that bridge the game crashes once I beat that guy that's trying to blow it up, the other door is later on and I've never seen it but my friend got that far and got stuck there because it wouldn't open
---
Yeah after some thought, this is probably the case, since all those icons are missing from elite specs, and they probably added the rest so .... hype dead ;(
---
That is my hope, it's just that Harpoon Gun feels sort of like an underwater Rifle, and Trident like an underwater Staff. Plenty of specs can still get Rifle and Staff, and they have a lot more skins available. In any case, the 30th can't come soon enough.
---
 Also got one from the collection and decided to buy the rest, as a result third garden disappeared.  It was extremely nice to throw money away
---
I just pretend it doesn't exist, cooking has never been relevant, nothing changed.
---
Yes, lets run a check on every account whether they have butternut soup, and if they do send them the appropriate amount. You can't look at this as a serious solution when its about this little gold honestly
---
What is that even supposed to mean
---
My point is that it avoids insane power creep and devaluing old content. This is classic Anet and should be what we all expect in these kinds of situations.
---
If its challenging and rewarding with unique mechanics then yes. I would much rather have things like that in reasonable expectable intervals than to wait 9 months for a raid wing thats easier than wings 1 and 4
---
What about this:  New Warrior elite spec called Gladiator.  They get a Minor trait that lets them use a shield with a 2-handed weapon and their new weapon is the Trident.  
---
You can't give spears to classes that already have it as an underwater weapon, since attempting to equip it would put it in your underwater slot. However, giving a class an underwater weapon they don't have already as a surface weapon would work fine.  
---
Also, the fact that so many tridents looks like spears would work in the favor of such an elite spec.
---
Black lion garden plot is on the gemstore but not discounted.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
Oh, I thought the second one is a dagger. Nevermind.
---
You had my curiocity but now you have my attention.
---
Ah nice. I'll add them to the list.
---
Oh lawd. The Chonk!
---
My favorite Open World Event in Guild Wars 2 in 7 years was destruction of Lion Arch by Scarlett, still I didn't experienced anything like it...
---
Me: I just finished levelling up an aquatic themed Sylvari!
---
Anet: releases these
---
Me: has one ticket scrap
---
Also me: Nooooooooo
---
I had hoped to forget that clip.
---
I see four posibilities for why underwater weapons are on this list.  
---
 A)  Underwater rewamp, your surface weapons now translates to underwater, and they solved the ground target design challenge.  With this, the underwater weapons are no longer needed in their current form and becomes new weapons for elite specs.  This would mean that some players who had underwater weapons equipped would now be unable to use them since they don't have an elite spec that uses their weapon anymore.    
---
B) Classes can get underwater weapons as surface weapons in elite specs if they don't have them as underwater weapons yet.    
---
C) Some classes can use underwater weapons on the surface too, you just need to pick where you equip it by right clicking.   
---
D) Underwater expantion/themed living story where giving an underwater weapon as elite spec makes sense (yea I kinda doubt that will happen).
---
7 out of 9 icons.. my hope for Rev Greatsword is fading
---
But we just clarified that it's not rewarding.  You can't design a reward based on a boss that isn't real.  Much like pvp custom arenas, or the obsidian sanctum.
---
&gt;stop making people spend their money on items they wont use
---
Who's making anyone buy this? It's actually a great deal if you want even a few things in it, and if you don't, just don't buy it.
---
On a condi build maybe... This is insane power food. Easy 1-2k dps.
---
Is it possible to make a building guide for this? Like a layer by layer map of blocks used? Would make the recreation of this easier for someone with little time :D
---
&gt; PvP and WvW could be a lot more enjoyable / balanced even with number-only changes (higher CD, lower dmg, etc.) and their skill-split system would allow them to pass these changes without affecting PvE.
---
Because seasons exist. Games don't do mid-season balance passes unless something is absolutely broken. Part of establishing a meta is creating a set format for a few months and then looking at what changes you could make to improve it. If you do things every few weeks, it's reactionary and may not hold to expectation.
---
ArenaNet isn't doing the best on the latter, but it's the same thing most games on the market do. Path of Exile, Diablo 3, League of Legends (in terms of holding meta for the tournaments), and most other games with seasonal content.
---
That's not to say mid-season tweaks aren't possible, but you avoid shaking up the meta because it hurts player retention.
---
But the backpiece sucked, now it's swapped
---
This is a novel idea. I will be more liberal with my commander tag. Why not! It only serves to help people know where the action is at
---
It takes a lot to make a stew...
---
Yeah my friend who only plays Charr characters would love it. Only thing is he's a few years away from the 7th birthday the poor guy.
---
You mean you cant stand people having different opinions?
---
one time use. I didnt get any seeds after harvesting either. not sure on what the grow time is like, I planted my patch once and then came back like 5 minutes later to see they had already grown
---
Should be fixt
---
Yes, all the missing ones.
---
No, he actually means stealing kills/targets. In WOW if you kill something not every player participating gets credit. Or when the target is dead, you need to wait long for respawns etc.
---
Only ran that one once. Seems like a challenge :&gt;
---
That better apply to the Birthday Blaster cake, the single best food in the whole game, or I riot.
---
11 minutes man...
---
"Im so unique" every person ever
---
that's the joke
---
We probably Need handgrown ingredients for most of These, since Noone seems to have figured them out
---
Im talking about actual ingame rewards not lore satisfaction. If you swapped Dhuum with some 100ft Ettin i wouldnt care tbh.
---
RemindMe! 6 months
---
Could be because Canada has no power over a company not in Canada, with a CEO that isn't Canadian.
---
so.. at least 3 classes get a underwater weapon? thats.. sad
---
It's also the same amount of syllables!
---
Some follow up! This was indeed a bug with 2FA using an authenticator - occasionally the field would only allow 5 chars.
---
The fix is now live. Thanks for reporting this issue, and sorry it took a bit to track down, even if you were able to get past it on your own.
---
Best of luck getting the gun powder in that pistol to ignite underwater though.
---
Yeah I bet the dozen other people eager to get those Underwater BL weapons will agree with you
---
Can't wait to see the sub burn
---
Will we get the same stuff as we did before, as in: Instanced story+map? (Because I feel like that really has to stop, instanced story just doesn’t belong in a multiplayer game.)   
---
Will the upcoming map actually be accessible through already existing maps? (Because I feel that gating maps behind story is really really bad for the feeling of a living, continuous world.). 
---
Will we see more regular releases of raids?   
---
Will we see new elite specs?   
---
Are you looking to give bounties more interesting rewards and make it scale better with player amounts (to low as well as high amounts)?  (Because I feel like bounties could be a really good way for people to just pick up and go with just to get some enjoyment out of the combat system without having to go into raids or fractals. And I think that WAS the intention but it has in many ways fallen short in keeping people’s interest.)
---
should have.
---
A tick of 315 damage every two seconds is a 1-2k dps increase over the next best thing, with the only difference being the lifesteal?
---
Do elaborate on how that might possibly work.
---
As far as I can tell based on the API, only 20 recipes were adjusted...
---
```
---
Candy Corn Cookie
---
Glazed Pumpkin Pie
---
Spicy Pumpkin Cookie
---
Carrot Soufflé
---
Pile of Walnut Crumble Topping
---
Bowl of Refugee's Beet Soup
---
Spicy Marinated Mushroom
---
Plate of Frostgorge Clams
---
Bowl of Garlic Kale Sautee
---
Mushroom Loaf
---
Plate of Spicy Herbed Chicken
---
Bowl of Zesty Turnip Soup
---
Bowl of Black Pepper Cactus Salad
---
Bowl of Sweet and Spicy Beans
---
Plate of Roasted Cactus
---
Bowl of Nopalitos Sauté
---
Bowl of Cactus Fruit Salad
---
Jar of Savory Winterberry Sauce
---
Winterberry Pie
---
Winterberry Sorbet
---
Could have done the old gifts thing. All current bowls would turn into "aged bowl of old soup" and then chef merchant would exchange it for 2x of current version. Tadaaa!
---
Requires planning and not hitting people who store many bowls though.
---
I got a free mount skin this last weekend so my luck for today's chest is reset to zero
---
so we have to mix and match the dishes with the herb seasoning
---
mint: 10% heal effect
---
sesame: gain health every second
---
clove: -20% inc condi duration
---
cilantro: steal health on crit
---
So, they are adding something that was formerly only available from the gem store, and that makes them "anti consumer"? Really?
---
I was only talking about living story maps since it was related to the new season. The good maps you named, well, not even one belongs to living world seasons.
---
Better scholar uptime, but definitely not 1-2k dps.
---
Try eating one to see how long it lasts. Before the update koi cakes lasted 30 min but had 20 min description.
---
I know of one other person in the group who said they had never done that dungeon. I know it was my first time in there, but we figured it out.
---
I hate that only 1 of my chefs will have upgraded the furnace. Its an achievement, its account bound so all of them should have it upgraded =(
---
Im glad you mentioned the Dhuum bench becsuse anothrr thing that makes no sense are why raid rewards arent locked behind the actual content. There really is no reason why rewards arent exclusive to the game mode.
---
Thanks, I needed confirmation after previous six threads and dev post.
---
M..kay?
---
Rub it in, fella 😉
---
Somehow I missed that one 😒
---
Check the timer on the item when used.
---
Some just have the wrong item description.
---
Still a problem if the description doesn't match, tho.
---
The issue is more that they would say things... then say nothing and it would get shelved without any progress or word on it.
---
They ended up doing very little of what they laid out in their old roadmaps. 
---
Dungeon revamps... lol... more guild content... lol... fractal leaderboards, well nerf the difficilty down and then... nope no leaderboard to compensate.
---
Ascended foods are going to be a thing only for WvW as the feast capability is only important there. Losing out on a 66% life steal proc or 10% damage reduction vs your basic Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash soup as a power class is basically nothing and each class will have different optimal foods anyways. You're only ever going to see ascended foods in volume in wvw or for speed records
---
might wanna double-check that link
---
why would it matter? and does dulfy actually spend a lot of time stating anything about gender either way? and if so, in what way does that affect anything?
---
i will check that out tomorrow. maybe we get more then 1 leaf per day from a plant, but looking at other ascended crafting i can't really see it. at least a little hope.
---
Hardly even any options for transmuting the underwater head armor. I have two options (including the current skin)…
---
Damn that kinda sucks the Jade Sea was dope
---
Game is fine if you are new player. You will have month of content to do.
---
You can also buy the gatherable items from the plots from the TP.
---
I play almost exclusively WvW, and always uses food for that. I am also doing Fractals now and then, where I use food and have started looking at raids where I use food.
---
But thanks for making random assumptions.
---
Fucking hell these are bloody amazing
---
After watching it, you're marked for life. Go to a crowded movie. Wait for the calm right before the previews. In that brief pause, you gently sing aloud, "Too many cooks..." There will be a handful of sudden sharp looks as you have now set the song to playing in their heads. It's like a disease.
---
Melee focus!?!? IS IT HAPPENING?!?!?!? ANET PLEASE
---
Gunpowder is its own source of oxygen. It's only if it spends a long time thoroughly soaked does gunpowder become inert. But that's why people can still fire guns underwater, and gunpowder can still explode. If a gun stops firing because it's wet, that's more likely to do with something stopping the firing mechanism from working rather than the gunpowder being off. But also MAGIC probably or some shit, in GW2. (or maybe the pistols get used as melee weapons l^m^a^o )
---
If he did it, i could care less about ESVI. There are plenty of great composers out there. It wouldn't take much to find one willing to try their hand at it.
---
Oh that is some good news
---
Oh were they talking about an increase over butterscotch? I thought an increase over no food at all. My bad.
---
Because twitch thots make more money than twitch man whores. Internet nerds jerk off to tits. Since forever. My guess is that it's obviously a guy. He faked being a girl, like so many of ~~us~~ these weird people back then during the beginning of the internet did (and yes, still do). Especially in niche nerd communities like MMORPG. Dulfy has been around since the early days of EQ, mind you. So, being a girl and getting all the attention and free loot and everything that comes with it, things escalated from there and ended up with him providing what he provides, but with the grief that if it ever gets out that he's a liar and a fraud, people will burn him to the ground no matter his work. So he now has to stick to his story or he may lose it all.
---
Money happens in form of youtube monetisation, patreon, ads, donations and a thousand additional things.
---
I'm not sure however how much he actually makes and if it would be really that big of a hit for him if a shitstorm rips it all apart, so there is that.
---
Of course, it might all be wrong. It's just the simplest explanation for a mysterious internet girl that's never been seen or heard and has exactly *one* picture that never got updated or added to. For decades. Yeah... no, I don't want your bridge. You can keep it.
---
I feel their is a ton of content ALREADY in the game that could be converted to guild missions and activities:
---
• Mount Races / Mount Adventures
---
• Champion Bounties
---
• Map Adventures - HoT &amp; PoF versions
---
• Map Events - make them instanced versions like Blightwater Shatterstrike, Deep Trouble, etc does and is on the map but instanced.
---
You know guild versions of the fishing event or the forged village attack - all scaled up or down appropriately
---
• Maybe the treasure hunt or any other of those map specific things that NO ONE does any more than one time and then never again
---
Also, then put appropriate, RELEVANT rewards in place.
---
Guilds right now, in terms of activities, are such a colossal waste.
---
They shouldn't abandon yet another system, especially guilds!
---
do you have all the required ingedients?
---
What exactly is the problem?
---
no i mean targets. in wow the first hitting a mob is the only who gets the reward.
---
We're going back to Vbbi!
---
Holy shit, that becomes meteor glider levels of obnoxious. I mean, sure, everyone knew it would happen. But good Lord!
---
Last one is probably focus but it looks like a knuckle duster and I'm fantasizing about a "barehanded" weapon.
---
The Map Rewards work exactly the same as [PvP](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_Reward_Track) and [WvW](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW_Reward_Track) Reward Tracks, if you're already familiar with those.
---
Mapping Materials are the PvE equivalent of [Potion of PvP Reward](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Potion_of_PvP_Reward
---
) / [Potion of WvW Rewards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Potion_of_WvW_Rewards).  If you have excess Karma, it's not a bad way to spend it.
---
my bad, I got confused by the defeating Jormag inadvertently undoes shiro's curse part of the statement up above
---

Oh oh that means Champion-level enemies. They're the ones that have a gold rim around their portraits. (See more on this stuff [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/NPC_rank)). There's also an event going on where you get extra rewards for killing them (with some exceptions), so people are going after them a lot harder than normal.
---
consider one thing.  any time someone calls out a public figure like this, they immediately get a ton of negativity and harassment and threats sent their way and have very little chance of seeing actual results.  with that in mind, why would they bother?  because they aren't just concerned with results.  they want the word to get out so people can be on their guard around this person.
---
what would be the point of lying about this and inviting all that fury upon yourself?
---
also, why the fuck would this become a trend for "attention" if every single time this happens its clear that the attention is overwhelmingly negative.  who would look at that and think "oh yeah i definitely want that".
---
anyways.  pretty much exactly the responses I expected here.

HP runs are pretty fun these days...with everyone on giant flying mounts, and eye-melting giant gliders. With 30+ people you can't even tell where you stand and you see newbies doing their first HP runs dropping off ledges constantly and getting left behind, because their vision is usually obscured by giant Skyscale wings and they can't see where they land or stand. Its hard enough for a new person to even keep up with a fasat moving HP train, not to mention trying to see through the glider/skyscale blob.

Was talking with a friend, we agreed WoW Classic would last a week before nostalgia wore off and reality set in. Nothing against it, it was great at the time, but we've come so far in terms of game design. LotRO and DDO pioneered a lot of changes that WoW eventually integrated, GW2 brought us into a new generation, and from that point on, every MMO from Wildstar to STO has built on the core idea in some unique way, to the point that WoW Classic feels downright ancient.

Need/Greed/Pass, being the first to tag a mob, all that, was so damn inconvenient. Makes you wonder how we ever lived with it.

There was a guy a ton of people followed on SoundCloud who pulled a similar thing, nuked all his music, and then months later posted that it was because of "depression" and "artistic changes". Whatever the excuses, if you're a public figure people look up to and rely on, it's not nice to just g-quit.

Pertaining to your original question think of elite specs as advanced classes. In GW2 you have 3 talent lines when you get to lvl 80 you have the ability to unlock what is essentially an elite talent line in your bottom slot which is unlocked by putting in hero points which are earned by doing various challenges around the maps. You earn more by doing hero point challenges in the expansion maps compared to the core maps. Elite Specs give you access to the abilities, traits, weapon types, and a new class mechanic unique to that spec. Imo ff14 does better with their class design but that just me. Thats elite specs in a nutshell

They play a girl in a video game so that means they "faked" being a girl? Are.. you actually retarded?
---
what does dual weapon look like
---
Personally I think that'd depend on how they're presented and in what context. For example, most of these weapons are usable above water, so perhaps the underwater specs would be simply built in a way that they're well functional underwater, but still work above water too. 
---
Additionally, if the next few areas lean into the water dragon heavily, we might find ourselves spending a lot of time under water and currently a few classes (specifically rev, IIRC) kinda suffer from a lack of well put together underwater class setup.
---
Kinda looks like Taylor Swift giving Taylor Swift a piggy-back ride.
---
Shh. It's new BiS. He NEEDS to use it else his enjoyment is broken. Don't expect of him to simply stick to regular food unless needed. That's snowflake casual talk, you'll never understand his pain.
---
Just a dagger. Warrior got dual dagger so that its in line with other warrior weapons. Warrior has the gimmick of beeing able of beeing able to dualwield all one handed weapons (excluding offhand only weapons like shield).
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_bonus_reward
---
* PvE tracks work with events. Tracks require 8000 points to complete, you get an item every 200 points, and each event gives you 100 bonus map reward points at gold participation, and less on lesser participation, and diminishing returns from doing many events in the same map with the same character also decrease that. 
---
 * These diminishing returns are character-based, so they can be easily ignored by switching characters. 
---
 * When you complete the track of a map, it resets back to the first item. When the track of a map changes weekly, the new current track continues where the previous was, the progress won't be lost. The only thing that resets the progress of a track is getting to 8000. You will never lose progress no matter how much time passes. 
---
* There's no caps on scout mapping materials. They always give 200 points, granting an item of the track, and they are not affected and won't affect diminishing returns.
---
* There's also no caps on events, other than diminishing returns.

Coming August 30th, ArenaNet presents: GW2 LS S5: Adventures Underwater with Steve and Underwater Elite Specs.
---
&gt; it alone lists 5 possible unknown recipes.
---
yeah with each of the 5 new ascneded cultivated herbs
---
I believe LW5 will give us new Weapons but no elite spec. But this could be for elite specs for future expansion. Missing 2 more. Hope Revenant get Greatsword
---
Idk, they seem to go back and forth between ignoring underwater and buffing underwater like adding the Sunken Treasure content.
---
Trident and Speargun share skins with other land weapons (Staff and Rifle). I want Land version of water weapons but hope they make the skins more interesting and different.
---
*Throws 10k gems at the gemstore*
---
It's for a friend. I swear.
---
Wouldn't be shocked, can almost see how the lay-out could be considering GW2 doesn't have to worry about multiple bars like WoW.
---
Endless Ocean Weapons. Trident, Speargun, Spear...

Looks like Bubbles just woke up boys.

This is circular reasoning. The only reason you think it's a secret is because of your fake gender theory in the first place. So you can't use it as a reason why the gender would be fake.
---
So, if everybody expects a mobile spin-off and they will actually announce a new expansion, will it be the exact opposite from that one Diablolo announcement?
---
If we had a more elegant animation set for one or two of the classes that use swords that one-hander could be really neat! Like a single-target burst Duelist style/
---
The supply drop background shows hoelbrak, I don't think it's coincidence.
---
This was my thought, WvW and PvE map farms like RIBA seem like the most logical uses
---
I took a bite out of the cheapest crafted food I could find and got over a thousand each of those extracts. You need ten exotics for every 5 rare, masterwork, and fine extracts, so those level 80 festival foods are worth looking into.
---
I mean the PoF announcement was about 25 minutes. Even though it's a live event, it's hard to believe that an announcement for "only" a LS season will take so much longer. 
---
At least it's reasonable to speculate that there could be more, especially for those who speculate that they will announce a mobile spin-off *or* a console version, since it's known that Anet did and do hire people for jobs that would fit exactly for this spots.
---
I've been hoping for Focus as an Engineer offhand, using it as a target designator for artillery, but of course it would need a mainhand to go with it unless they're happy to force people to use pistols with it.
---
When I used to have Blizzard stock, they would give more information of the timeline on the investor calls. I haven't heard the same amount of information flowing from Anet.
---
Thanks for the data. Once I’ve got some cultivated peppercorn I’ll be looking to see what extra effect it gives. Incoming damage reduction is a possibility. So far, Mint is looking good for healers.
---
WTB brass knuckles focus
---
I think its everything in season 5 feature wise and maybe the names of the maps. They likely have everything scoped out and agreed on. I also think there will be some news on an expansion to do one think shut up the "oh GW2 is dead they are only doing living world they aren't doing expansions crowd". I'm not saying we are getting the A to Z of a new expansion I'm saying we'll get a title and thats it.
---
This has nothing to do with the justice system. Nobodies putting him on trial here. I can't convict him. All I can do is form my own judgement.
---
Nah, I'm sorry if I'm feeling pedantic, but words have power. That is to say, the use of words has meaning far beyond just casually saying words. Because of my time as an editor, this is something that is really personally important to me. I look at a sensationlist headline, why did the dungeon feature fail and to me, this word is misleading. It's attempting to make it look like dungeons, which were designed to teach certain game mechanics and to give people unique weapon and armors skins, no longer does either of those things...except it does or at least can. That is to say, the headline of this thread feels hyperbolic and I'm reacting to that at a time when everyone seems to have a complaint.
---
I don't believe the system itself has failed. I believe the system is supplanted by a better system. I feel it's completely disingenuous to say that people don't know the implication of the word fail or what calling someone a failure is. Anet moved on from one type of 5 man instanced content to another, because it was more easily maintainable. To use the word fail has certain implications and sure, people are mad now and they're happy to ignore those implications.
---
I'm not. 
---
Anet simply transitioned instant five man content from something that took more work to something they could streamline. This happens all the time in business but we don't call the predecessor of the system a failure.
---
If you're happy to use hypberbolic language to make a point that could be made without it carry on. But there are people out there who will see this as nothing but another person trying to shit on the game, because they're annoyed. And you know, some of us are getting tired of it.  Probably not you, but some people.
---
As for the editor thing, you try editing hundreds or even thousands of books and articles and then not saying anything about language use.

Yes, at the end of the sylvari "line".

With the new ascended cooking, I'm curious if they are planning new level 500 crafting stations for the other skills for our home instance.
---
I got it from the free one today in the shop, is it rare?
---
What game are you going to?
---
Fair enough. I don't get the fascination with people thinking a mobile spin-off will happen, but that's just me.
---
Saying "innocent until proven guilty" is apparently taking a side now. Ok
---
There's a combo of Glob of Gelatin + Snow Truffle + Bowl of Garlic Butter Sauce
---
Since you play a reaper, I'd be curious to see the number of players who tried scourge, said screw this and went back to reaper.
---
I dunno, that looked shiny and boring too.  Even more so because it just awakens a feeling of 'meh.'. No pizazz.  No excitement.  Just, "that's there I guess."
---
I feel no attachment to the weird bird thing.  Maybe if I had context it would be worth fighting and claiming a trophy from.
---
In dungeons it was 100% the case though. In raids it was the case apart from that one raid group that is proud of toxicity of their members, some servers didn't even have such a raid groups.
---
I remember 3 people changing server cause they couldn't find anyone to do dungeons after loot stealing from my personal experience.
---
Idk what WoW you played.

That's actually a good way to look at that.

---

---
The crafting window would also like a word. 
---
(Me: "OMG why do I have to keep minimizing Backpacks? Stay minimized!!")
---
I don't think the meta is bad and there absolutely are non-meta builds that are effective especially in pug groups but they are unfortunately mostly limited to healing builds.
---
Anyway you don't necessarily to follow a meta build exactly as it is especially when pugging because, while the vast majority of players will be using a meta build, the group almost certainly won't be using the meta team comp for each boss so you can swap a few things out to something else to cover whatever your current team comp is missing. I think the most common example I could give is groups on Samarog or Matthias swapping out damaging skills for more CC. Changes like this are really minor though and you'll still be something like 95% meta and I personally wouldn't even bother calling a build with such small changes like this non-meta.
---
To address some other things you've said, of course it's going to feel like work learning how to do something you don't know. When I'm trying to learn a new build I may get discouraged at first with my initial poor performance but the secret is to not give up and keep trying until you start getting better. When you see your progress you get a rewarding feeling. If you don't invest the time then you won't get better. If you don't want to invest the time altogether then don't invest the time but that's the choice you've made. Don't be that dps Scrapper who calls people toxic because he got kicked for having toughness higher than his boss dps.
---
Yes the meta is worth it and it's actually ironic because the good players who understand the meta builds, have a lot of experience in raids and understand every boss mechanic are the ones don't actually need to use meta builds and are the ones who can easily pull off boss kills and raid clears with off meta builds and memetastic team comps. For example I remember a while ago now there was a group that did Sabetha with 10 pistol/pistol thieves.
---
There are so many other threads about this topic already that this should have been posted on, no need for a *rude* new thread to say.....really nothing that is not already common knowledge.  Low effort/low value posts are against the rules.
---
And it was too long because the difficulty was the overscaling.  Even now it takes a good 30 minutes, but now it gets done.
---
You consider innocent until proven guilty a 'glaring flaw'. You have issues.

Plate of Peppercorn Spiced Poultry Aspic [https://i.imgur.com/URyeiag.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/URyeiag.jpg)
---
Yup, looks like it's -10% incoming damage for Cultivated Peppercorn.
---
&gt; While conditions where fairly accessible from launch, boons where more scarce and in general lower duration.
---
I miss the class specific conditions, like the mesmer's skills that caused a constant health drain or overcast, or the necromancer's ability to draw health directly from an enemy or corpse bombs. 
---
Speaking of necromancer, I don't really feel like it's the same class from GW1 and feel like the devs only included it because it was in the first game, but really had no clue how to translate it to GW2. The whole "flavor" of it feels a little "off" if that makes sense.
---
Oh awesome, that probably means that these sales are coming soonish. I have someone who was waiting for them to go on sale so he'll be happy about that
---
what are the dye channels like?
---
I like DF for farming. The loot isn't too rich, but it's a nice activity rinse and repeat loop.
---
I do wish their was more events like Teq though as well.

Fun stuff.

They are nice any videos of them in game?

Maybe if they moved their codebase from C++ to Rust.. /memethink

Might be rng but I'm using a molten sickle and haven't gotten the seeds for cooking in over 100 plants.
---
There is absolutely nothing suspicious about that. Unless you have a serious answer to the question you asked yourself 3 posts ago and that you should have answered before even building your suspicion.
---
Being a female is not something rare, magic or mysterious. It happens to roughly half of the human population. If someone declares themselves a female (and unless you provide answer to the above question that you boldly told me to ask her, instead of realizing you're the one who should have the answer in the first place), there is quite a high chance they are. Avoiding behind heard or seen doesn't require "actively" doing it ... the person just maintains an internet site, they're not a youtuber or whatever. I have one too (it's been only for "only" 7 years and a month, not decades), you never saw my face.
---
What modern games have they looked at recently and what cool things could they draw inspiration from
---
Maybe they're making underwater weapons usable above water?
---
I would like us to have the ability down the road to dual spec. (Think reaper using torch on secondary weapon set.)
---
Ok yeah I'm just dumb and didn't realize I had to harvest the node ON my chef lol. Tried to character swap to gather for efficiency, but it will only drop for your chef character.

#STAFF DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A TRIDENT 0/10

hence the "for me" part of the last sentence. Some people enjoy the social part, I do not.
---
W8, no humans? Thats heresy.
---
Lasts 10 mins still.
---
I *think* the 10% damage reduction would be the BiS for dps classes in T4/Raids, 
---
Since assuming you already have a healer in your comp (which you almost always will), the damage reduction becomes much more valuable than a measly 150HP lifesteal. Your dedicated healer is expected to always keep the party topped up on health, so avoiding dangerous 1 shots becomes more beneficial.

You act as awful as them... 🙄 You want the toxic energy to stop? Stop your own toxic energy first.

Let me know if you find anything! I have broken out of every single map aside from that one, there might be something you can work with after you get past the first boss but the legacy fractals are the best for goating in :P
---
Not really without spending a ton of time. The download is in the top comment though
---
hype dead, definitely not new elite specs
---
Mtgnarena and my own business in my spare time. I raid in gw2 because it is the only game i have time since there's no grind. If its not making raids im done with mmos.
---
Wow classic looks really tempting but I think I can make a clean break and it will be better for me.
---
Nice. Same sentiments from me about gw2. But I'll miss a mmo though
---
Hey, thanks for the advice. I really appreciate it! I do struggle with writing an “about” section. I’ll definitely keep in mind these pointers when I rework the site. Thanks again for the valuable feedback! 🙂
---
Rev is overpowered underwater from what ive heard - if you do conditions
---
Gotta complain to whatever Anet does, hot trend
---
Ah give me my swords with a defined hamon and I'll be set.
---
Interesting to know. The reference screenshots did look Taylor Swifty. I find it fun that it’s possible to cosplay within the game. I know a guy that does a full on ronald MacDonald
---
That’s cool, I’ll post my Gw stuff here anyways 🙂
---
It's not a middle finger, it's the pure gold part of the seasonal item. Those always exist, though getting the 50s one is not very lucky. Why did you open said item, remove the other part of it before taking the screenshot and then act as if it was a direct loot from one of the rng slots ?
---
This is kinda manipulative.
---
Not sure if I’ll catch that one 😂
---
the new skyscale skins look quite good, specially the ABSOLUTE UNIT  skin
---
Ive been wondering what weapon would make the most sense for engi for a third elite spec, and I think focus might make the most sense, or maybe a scepter so we don't have to suffer mainhand pistol.
---
So, to make sure I'm understanding this correctly, to grow the specific herbs you need to spend money to buy the home instance plots, right? It's not something you can get just by playing the game? 
---
If this is the case, I foresee a huge backlash from the community. If you can't afford to buy gems, you might as well not even bother with this.
---
if you're talking about the final portion against the Branded Zealot/Hydra then yes, I agree.  However, I don't agree that Phase 2 was too long or too difficult.  It seemingly was intended to be a difficult meta and Phase 2 was the part groups died at NOT Phase 3 which is the only portion that really had issues with overscaling.  
---
Also it doesn't get done that much now.  Yes, it certainly gets done much more often now than it used to, but since Forged With Fire gives the Amalgamated Gemstone as well for about 7 minutes of work vs. 30 min+ any smart farmer avoids Serpent's Ire entirely.
---
Did you need grow lamps as well?
---
Also.... there was a deleted tweet that said there will be a 20% discount on Garden Plots for the anniversary. Don't rush to buy them right away.
---
It can't be the other way if it is meant to be expansion like. Elite specializations are bare minimum.
---
Right? Half the people who won probably don't play anymore.
---
How did you find this image?
---
Anet said there was a definitive no a while ago.
---
My scryingball says purple.
---
I would like you to be right. I just crave novelty, no matter how small.
---
As a DE player myself, I'm fine with it being telegraphed. Nobody likes being sniped, so it feels fair as far as an MMO spec is concerned. You can take out the unaware, but it makes sense experienced magic-users aren't as vulnerable.
---
On the side of disappointment though, it sucks you don't actually have the highest range or feel like you can actually exude any pressure. 
---
* You got somethings like AoEs from caster-type classes being able to aim the center up to 1200, so it actually goes further, the bigger ones up to 1500. 
---
* Ranger being able to match you feels weird.
---
* And having high ground actually shrinks your range because it's a sphere, which is not very intuitive. If they could make our range behave like a cylinder or cone so high ground mattered, that'd be amazing.
---
1600+ on just Death's Judgement with everything else at 1500 or less would be cool, I think.
---
Imagine thinking Dragonfall is a challenge compared to Teq rework.
---
The sceptre and focus look gorgeous. Shame my Guard is already themed out.
---
&gt;Cultivated 
---
Are these only from the garden plot or can they be gathered in the world?
---
Your best bet is to post in LFG. It seems dead because not many people are sitting in a queue. If you post “Story mode, all welcome”, the group won’t take too long to fill. I enjoy the occasional dungeon sprees because they’re easy content and a change of pace.
---
Same here. I am actually thinking of buying the deeds and maxing out my home instance.
---
You're more or less correct, I just had to think it through for myself.
---
They increased the cap to 3 *and* are giving a free one out to people who already have 2?! Now I only find out about this after it's been disabled, RIP
---
It works.

I'm with you. Still playing, still excited for new content.

GW2 is a great game! The story is tailored to your choices in character creation, so is a little different for every player and every playthrough. Lots of clases and races to choose from. I will say that the body details in character creation seem expansive, but I often have a hard time finding combinations that I like. 
---
The game itself is huge. Just finishing the map takes days. You'll reach the max level cap (80) pretty quick, but there is so much to do after 80, including specializations and masteries, which are the real focus of GW2 endgame. 
---
Guild Wars honestly has a bit of everything. So, it's very hard to lose interest. And, if you do, it is very easy to pick up when you come back.
---
Literally what are you even talking about
---
Your comment regarding GW2 lacking a gameplay loop is the crux of the issue.  
---
In GW1, you had stuff like prestige armour, unique weapons, elite skills and Hall of Monuments to grind for.  These things were fairly easy to unlock but plentiful in number.  Additionally since your Heroes also could equip gear, there was even more to keep you occupied.  
---
In GW2 it’s sort of the opposite.  It’s primarily Ascended and Legendary equipment which are difficult to unlock and few in number.  Things like Fractals, the Crafting system and WvW are just different pathways to grind out Ascended and Legendary equipment.  
---
Once you obtain Ascended/Legendary equipment, you end up with a “what do I do now” type situation.  This is probably why the GW2 developers are doubling down on time gating mechanics.  They’re trying to keep players occupied without having to add new gameplay mechanics.  It is essentially an “artificial gameplay loop”.  
---
We probably wouldn’t be having this discussion if GW2 was closer to GW1 in terms of game design.
---

Wait a sec. Wvw event bugs out so you can use skills with no cooldowns and Anet doesn't do anything for whole week, but plot deeds get disabled within several hours?

Something doesn't feel right here.

I have always a monk/kungfu elite spectialization, and thief, warrior are two good candidates  for them.

so trident, speargun, spear on LAND? WOOOO

Soul Pastries are 45 min lol

OMFG Land Spear/Trident/Spear gun. i was drunk ranting about this last night!
---
They give you a free plot when you finish the collection. The other two can just be used to grow more
---
They're filling out the weapon icons in build window. Maybe because these weapons will be used in build templates or new elite specs. But these are def not elite spec icons.
---
Warrior with dual foci using them as brass knuckles.
