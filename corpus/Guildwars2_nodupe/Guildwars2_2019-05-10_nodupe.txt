There is that theory of what might have happened when Aurene devoured Joko. With Kralk absorbing and appropriating the magic of Zhaitan, Mordremoth, and Balthazar who wasn't a dragon to begin with, it's safe to assume that Elder Dragons and their scions can absorb and adapt any known kind of magic.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Aurene can feasibly have absorbed Joko's undeath magic.
---
---
---
I hated the old LA. The rickety repurposed-shipwreck hovels with blury textures and low poly. No sense of direction, no planning, no visual appeal - just dirty planks and even dirtier dull gray rock. It won't even work with mounts, the layout is too convoluted with little open space.   
---
I hope they don't take away the new LA as the main hub.
---
Dormammu, I have come to bargain.
---
HOT made me quit for a few years. I’d go straight to POF and not just get the Raptor, I’d unlock canyon jumping and also get High Vault/Jump on the Springer. It will dramatically improve your quality of life.
---
what armor is that (or is it new stuff)
---
It was fun but perhaps I perceived it that way because of the double exp buff? I’m definitely supportive if anet wants to make such events more often, but I wouldn’t want no downed state to be a permanent addition.
---
I won't rest until Ele gets a Shaman spec. With axes, thank you very much! (would kinda fit the lore if the next expansion pulled towards blood legion homelands)
---
63.25% chance of at least one ecto. Mean number of ectos per salvage with mystic/master salvage is 0.875.
---
Tbh i thought it would release on the 28th, but I knew people that were more of optimist than I.
---
Druid, renegade, or firebrand are your common high utility healer classes. Druid can bring spirits, spotter, and might, renegade can bring alacrity and assassin's presence, and firebrand can bring quickness and some more defensive support.
---
Tempest is a super strong healer but it doesn't always bring quite as good of utility, and scourge is a strong off healer (barrier) with condi cleanse, but not much offensive support
---
I was wondering about the second option to get luck and sell dust. But I don't have much mystic stones so probably is better copper if there is not much difference.
---
The expected value (mean) number of ectos upon salvaging a rare is 0.875 ectos.
---
The value of selling a rare is 0.85 times the listed price due to TP fees. 
---
The cost of one salvage of a mystic salvage kit as 10.496 copper (assuming free mystic forge stones).
---
This means that if we let selling price of a rare be p, and the price of ecto be e (both in copper),
---
0.85 p - 10.496 &gt; 0.875 e  
---
p &gt; 0.875 / 0.85 e + 10.496 / 0.85
---
p &gt; 35/34 e + 12.35 copper
---
The 12.35 copper is pretty negligible, so price has to be greater than roughly 35/34, or 103%, of the price of an ecto.
---
[removed]
---
Just a special lobby pass with the teleport mechanics from the recent one.
---
That´s a pretty precise answer. I don´t think I will make those maths by my own everythime I plan on selling something, but I've just doing some estimates with your formulas and understand it now perfectly. But I will keep the 103% and 87.5% percentages, that simplify it completely. Thanks for taking the time. Looks like you love maths too!!
---
Goddamn this is fantastic.
---
Sooner than I expected. Can't wait!
---
Everyone has pain. Just because I disagree with you doesn't mean there's something "wrong" with me. Get over yourself.
---
I'm not much for I told you so though its nice to be vindicated though.
---
&gt; One can see the differences by flipping between this image and this one.
---
one could if the two images weren't different sizes.
---
I think out of those, the one that sounds most interesting to me would be Scourge. I was eyeing the Necromancer because I like the area denial they can put up on walls in WvW, but I wasn't sure how viable they are in other aspects of the game. 
---
Do you have a recommendation as to which might be more well-rounded in multiple game types between Revenant, Ranger, Necromancer? If I did need to DPS, do any of those three stand out as having an easier-to-execute DPS rotation?
---
I think the "price of 1 ecto" rule of thumb is definitely close enough to 103% if you do not plan on selling the ectos. If you do then the 87.5% is necessary I think.
---
Funny enough people in government wouldn't be nearly so universally rich if they simply weren't allowed to spend such obscene amounts of money on their campaigns or if corporations weren't allowed to pay them off.
---
If you don't think major corporations have the power to impact your life in a profound way...again, Brooklyn bridge, etc.
---
I don't have any faith in the people in government, I frankly don't trust anyone who holds any kind of power or anyone who hoards billions of dollars they could never use in several lifetimes, that's why I want checks and balances in place to keep them from being able to do whatever they want without being held accountable. 
---
I don't know why you have so much faith in rich people though. They will literally poison your water and kill you if they think it'll make them an extra penny and if they can get away with it.
---
Wouldn't shaman be more torch themed?
---
It alsp gets "wings" when thrusted
---
Outside of HoT and PoF maps? Can't say. I don't remember whats Core Tyria Total Hero Points is.
---
They added like 42 weapon skills with a weaver. 24 new ones for core wespons, 12+6 for sword. A 2 hander would just have 20 since they probably wont put in similar mechanic for other specs.
---
unless the reveal is that Tyria was in the Mists all along!!
---
I predict Scavengers Causeway.
---
No probs, and good luck to both of you!
---
Thanks for the tips! I guess I'll go with the train method and try and keep my eyes closed haha
---
WvW(maybe pvp, idunno) gives you tokens that can be traded to get certificates to magically complete a hero point that you haven't completed. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heroics_Notary
---
Playing through the Expansion content gives you access to enough mastery points as you need them. by the end, you should have almost all the mastery points you need, and it will just be the exp part of unlocking all the masteries that will remain.
---
They're are some cool ones though. Female norn with tattoos to show off when exposed actually looks pretty badass and not skanky
---
I haven't used it myself; but I thought maybe /u/jackbobevolved has a bunch of the mats for that one to get that gift instead; since farming 3 HoT maps for Machete currency may not be the way to go.
---
Thanks for the details! Any chance you could peg an estimate for the time required to get the 250 points? I've never even touched WvW before truthfully
---
Considering there was no payed content released (apart from people who pay for lw episodes after missing their release) any increase is actually really good.
---
MAY 14th **Aurene Day**!
---
I'm new to reddit in general
---
Why am I crying.
---
No, really,  how, why. Aurene... Damnit I want Aurene back, I love that little dragon. Anet is dangling hope in front of us now...
---
I'm always baffled on the amount of manpower required to do the seemingly most trivial stuff work in a game like this.
---
I'm going to point at a finger at the person who saw said leeks as the most likely culprit for these leeks.  Fess up!  Was it you who leeked these leeks?  ^^^^^^^/s
---
Hes a fake wizard and a meh writer.
---
You have it very wrong: I have faith in neither.  I'm simply trying to illustrate that "the corporations are out of control, government to the rescue" is not a realistic solution to any problem.
---
[Here's what they patched out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOMmZ4J93PY)  But it changed the way jumping worked in game.  If you are close to what the engine perceives to be a ledge it will stamp down on your upward movement.  It's why you have to stand a little back from what should clearly be an easy jump up but the engine is purposely stopping you.
---
Most browsers scale oversized images to the height or width of the browser, and you'd have to click to zoom in to actual size.
---
So be less of an ass.
---
Personally, legendaries are more than just the model. HMS is a prime example of this: I honestly prefer Predator’s design but HMS has absolutely outstanding animations and sound effects that make it a blast (pun intended) to use in combat. Plus, it clearly matches any pirate look.
---
Guardian does better and provides the group with staff/conal block/aegis to boot on top of pulls.
---
Encoded Orders is a better alternative to using a WP though.
---
As u/morbideel stared, it will take a longer than just doing them in the maps. Although since your friend is studying abroad for a while, you’d easily have time. This would allow you to learn an amazing game mode, while stocking up HPs, without ruining the new maps for you. My estimate would be about 20 hours total, and you could unlock the Warclaw mount in the process.
---
If only... XD
---
Cheers mate!
---
I actually liked the flash backs for showing some of aurene transitions though.
---
This. I would make it in a heartbeat if it had one.
---
Blades without blade trails just feel lacking
---
So, I'm a newish player. I'm getting the expansions soon, and wanted to ask: How is Revenant? Renegade specifically? 
---
I haven't really found a prof that checks all the boxes I want in a main yet - namely versatile builds for fractals and open world without being stupidly complicated (looking at you, Ele and Engi). Renegade seems to have a few choices for "close enough to meta" builds, with Condi DPS, Healing, or Alacrigade offering some variety and a way for me to try out a bit of every type of build in the game. But they also seem to be an extremely niche pick from my experience in-game.
---
Is that true, or is it confirmation bias? Would it be difficult to get into fractals with it? What are they like in general - how is their mobility, solo-ability, and the leveling experience? How are they in WvW and PvP? Would I be able to play any type of content in the game playing it, or would I be pressured to switch for higher level raids (from a healing Renegade to a Druid, for example)?
---
I know high level fractals are very far off, probably a balance patch or two away for me going from 1-80, at least, so it's subject to change. But it would still be nice to know what to expect if nothing changes significantly.
---
Don’t remind me. I’m so bitter they removed it from guardian and mesmer. Thankfully, they touched necro and it still has it
---
[Can we just get his please?](https://youtu.be/EcPs5DYwW8I&amp;t=20s)
---
What you mean catch up?  The game is tailored around casual players.  Doing the story from the very beginning to the end is maybe a few weeks of gameplay if you go at it constantly.
---
That is one hell of a response! I love it and I love the enthusiasm. Now I want to get through these 3 levels even faster ahhhhh thank you!
---
Distribution is a bad argument for this. Staff is used by 7/9 classes and Sword is used by everyone except necro.
---
It’s great for cancer mirage/chrono pvp build.
---
&gt; big head = more cuteness
---
Bobbleheaded spiders would like a word
---
&gt; You know literally nothing about me
---
Pot, kettle, etc.
---
Again, let's just table this.
---
IIRC, its ok for average players to be average and not compare themselves to the minority of players at the top.
---
That’s a good pattern to follow. With how differently they’ve been doing promotions lately I didn’t know what to expect, I figured if they released a trailer it would be like 2 weeks in advanced to the episode
---
The Fissure and Underworld as corrupted by Mist-Kralky would be perfect places to bring back the Branded War event from the beta (where you became Branded when you died and had to fight the other side).
---
Power/Thoughness/Vitality is bad for a new player doing the Hot/Pof Story for the first time? (with a build from a up to date guide)
---
If you know how your class works going full nuke is no problem but a first timer will have some trouble...
---
1
---
Hardly a loss for you OP, but I wish I bought the game sooner. I missed all the LWS1 episodes prior to Fractured.
---
Look at the ingredients to make Sharur/Pharus
---
A true god is low level, acts like any normal low level/new player, but helps whenever someone messages them about something specific... you know, answering their prayers. :P
---
That second pic is totally the Fissure of Woe. I don't know what else it could be.
---
The "Guild Wars 2 - Standard Collection (Path of Fire - Standard &amp; Heart of Thorns - Standard)" bundle will give a single key. Just checked my receipt. :)
---
The [meta fractals build](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/hybrid-renegade) is very good but it needs a quickness firebrand  to cover quickness so you need a second player running the complimentary build for it to really function, It's not a great pure DPS option compared to many other choices. For raids like you saw it can run a very strong [condition DPS](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/condition/), [power alacrity](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/alacrity/) (has the same issues as fractals and wants at least 1 firebrand), or [healing build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/heal/) (also gives alacrity).
---
In general the alacrity rotations are very simple and it's just energy management while swapping legends. The main healer in your group is going to be a druid but renegade can be the secondary healer but again you'd still want a quickness firebrand to capitalize on the alacrity and replace a chronomancer. 
---
The profession in general is very mobile with teleports, swiftness, and [superspeed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superspeed) available to them. Also a great choice for soloing content, especially with herald providing tons of boons and having 2 options for heal skills. 
---
[In WvW](http://builds.vabbi.org/) they play as meta power DPS for large groups since they have a ton of ranged AoE damage with hammer. PvP is a little harder as they usually run a more power burst focused build that can be tricky to play but very strong ([example build with players listed at the bottom](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Herald_-_Power_Shiro)).
---
we were lucky to get more gen 2. I doubt gen 3 is a worthwhile bet. We haven't even had a new jumping puzzle in ages.
---
I missed LWS1, LWS2, HoT and LWS3 too. But I'm glad I did not miss PoF and LWS4.
---
Thanks for the information! Any guide or video you'd recommend to get started on it?
---
but wouldn't all that be on your friend's account?
---
[here](https://i.imgur.com/G6GMa00.png) red is the leg, light green is parts of the armour. forgive the wonkiness, i couldn't be bothered plugging my tablet in and i use a right-handed mouse when i'm left-handed, lol
---
Oh, that settles it then. Thank you!
---
Thanks. Rather than the downvotes with no suggestions, you at least provided a path forward.
---
I thought they just chose that map with the biggest cliffs and to completely avoid new map, not to be cryptic about it.
---
possible, but some way or another, she will come back
---
I do agree with you that most shamans in fantasy are represented as mages and Guild Wars 2 is no exception where the only shamans in the game are flame legion shamans, who are in fact mages. However, i would argue that should a shaman proffesion be adapted by other Legions than the flame legion, we could se some variation in their fighting style, especially considering that you would have to include the other 3 attunements.  
---
In the end, the use of an axe or a mace is more of a personal desire i would like to see. Having a melee weapon crash into the earth and release a serious cataclysm would be great. I love to debate Elite specs, and the two i would like to see the most in the future would have to be (of course) the Shaman for ele, or a Duelist for Thief (using shield).
---
After using the weapon skin it'll appear in your wardrobe. You'll need to use a transmutation charge to change any other weapons to that skin.
---
Honestly it takes very little time. Participation no longer degrades/vanishes upon logout, so you don't have a long boring-ass wind-up to your rewards anymore. Pop in and solo some camps and do dailies and you're good. Also, most zerg activities take more than enough time to allow you to catch up and get participation since mounts only run super fast when they're in owned territory. As soon as they hit enemy territory, they're only a fraction faster than you with swiftness.
---
honestly its not that fast. I could always stay near the tag, while unlocking the mount
---
There’s also the part where you had a stealth cloak and a taser gun in order to sneak around town for intel without setting off the alarm. Reminded me so much of MGS1, I was almost in tears. Truly brilliant.
---
That's a fair point, and I will say they last few tiers in each HoT mastery required way too many points.
---
Yeah that's the one I was talking about. The rift that when you activate it releases a votile magic trail that you follow.
---
I don't recognize the armor, can someone tell me wich one this is ?
---
besides expacs, has this actually ever happened before? damn the hype is real if this is a first
---
Confirmed -- I just finished up the Old Tom collection yesterday after putting it off forever, and putting Professor Mew, Mister Mittens, or Baron Von Scrufflebutt in the forge in order to create each successive step doesn't unlock the skin for you.
---
Herald is actually really good in open world since you provide a ton of needed boons not only to yourself but 9 other targets! So in large groups or solo open world I enjoy the profession a lot, no need to go the full heal/alacrity route as well since you can run [full berserker](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/herald/boon/) ([more build options](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Herald_-_Power_Glint)). I will say that leveling a revenant early on was pretty bad since you are locked out of a lot of your core mechanic (legends and swapping) til later but maybe the new core revenant skill helps with that a little.
---
You honestly suck. I want to get back in the game after a long hiatus and this is what you offer? I don't expect you to hold my hand, but a ton things have changed. Maybe offer something constructive next time.
---
I like you.
---
Crystalline Dust are rare items, so the more chance the kit has to salvage rarer items, the better is. ^Just ^don't ^use ^anything ^expansive ^like ^Black ^Lion ^Salvage ^Kits
---
It's a good option, but it doesn't actually solve the problem that it's very confusing for newbies that the skin is a separate thing from the item, and is sometimes the thing you need for a particular achievement and sometimes is not.
---
It's something you learn only after you've made the mistake (which can sometimes be costly, and makes it particularly punishing for newbies who don't have a ton of gold to throw around yet).
---
Why would you use it for social awkwardness? I'm so confused.
---
Whatever you do, don’t play condi renegade in fractals. Phases are short in fractals, so you have no time to build up condis. Heal or hybrid alacrigade is meta in fractals, and demand for them is high. Set your self up for success later by using a good class. For dps: weaver soulbeast dragonhunter or holosmith. Support; alacrigade quickbrand bannerslave. 
---
Even if you’re far from high level fractals, you’ll be most successful with good builds, and won’t regret gearing it later.
---
Raids are another story for another time.
---
Usually the main reason to have the maximum number of alts even if you don’t play the is for extra storage, keeping one of the characters at level 49-53 for opening bags.
---
oh boy, after finding the screenshots showing different effects for classes other than mesmer I'm 100% gonna make this now
---
This spud is an international treasure.

[This appears to be one of the most recent guides.](https://youtu.be/kOG78xpNOOw)  My wife and I got into it by befriending a rank 3,500 player who showed up the ropes. Feel free to ask for help in map chat (don’t use team chat, that’s reserved for server wide tactics), and you’ll likely find someone willing to help teach you. Start on the borderlands, and eventually work your way into running on Eternal Battlegrounds. There are two primary styles of play, zerging with 20+ players, or roaming solo or in small groups. What class, region, and server are you playing on?

I'm just hoping this is the reveal music for Cantha
---
Yeah, that mastery begins with a "rift" that the Skyscale can open. It looks like a spark in the sky when unopened.
---
Install normally and if not works try running as admin and/or installing in game root folder answering N on installer ""Install in bin64? " prompt.
---
Honestly, I thought it could be a subtle nod to location too. They like their super-obscure references (like the Balthazar reveal being "hinted" at with that one White Mantle dude holding a Balthazar Shield at the end of Out of the Shadows when Lazarus shows up).
---
the images are not the same size. one of them is a whole inch smaller than the height of a full screen browser window.

Hot maps still super active! It's where I spend most of my free time :)

If you're honest and your monitor isn't vertical then you shouldn't be having any issue with what I said.
---
The orange background can mess with how a character looks, I miss the more neutral green.
---
it's just a normal 4k 24" monitor. since you seem so determined to deny reality, I'm just going to conclude you're a troll and block you.
---
Eeeh, that was really not a question. Even the title of that was “Yeah, Not So Much”, with the question about how long does it take to get mounts being tacked in. 
---
Not saying that a criticism should be downvoted - it shouldn’t be - but that’s some next level “I was only asking!” here
---
Anet dont have a great track record for using doors that have existed for years though, i'm looking at you Bandit Bridge and Western Sparkfly path (leading literally directly to Southsun, but never used)
---
All I want to know is what did Glint say to her when she said it’s a dragon thing while doing the trial.
---
It must be something about it, and I believe it would be something about her must die to ascend or getting branded to get powered up or something.
---
Or maybe we over analyzing and she is just dead.
---
New playable Tengu confirmed!
---
That's definitely the case. Unfortunately you need to bind the weapon.
---
Character slot (800 gems) and Lily of the Elon Pass (permanent passes usually sell for 1000 gems, I don't think this one was ever sold on the BLTC) are nice to have if you're interested. If not, just get the standard version.
---
Wow, that's a bit rough.
---
The emperor of Cantha.
---
Opens up Tengu ad playable race.
---
I know it will never happen but it would be dope if the deep sea dragon created an event that changes all of Tyria. Kind of like what Deathwing did in WoW.
---
Karma weapons can't have the sigil retrieved by salvaging the weapon. That's the only difference between karma weapons and ones you buy with gold. Check how much the sigil costs to decide repurchasing costs.
---
TP is a good option, I'd suggest using the search options (the gear next to the search) to search for power, precision, ferocity weapons instead of just "berserker" since it will show some cheaper options as well. Karma armor is a cheap option but the big issue with it is you can't salvage it when you're done to recover the runes in it. Getting cheap "named" armor like [devona's](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Devona%27s_armor) is also a good option.
---
That'd be pretty cool if it was something like that too. I dont think that's shes gone for good though
---
My current theory is that Season 5 will be, like Season 3, a "multi-plot season" and will focus on 1) finding replacements for Mordremoth and Zhaitan, 2) Bangar Ruinbringer / the charr-human peace situation.
---
My reasoning:
---
* In all honesty, we should have focused on finding replacements for Z and M before going after Kralkatorrik, so that we'd have a buffer to the whole "destruction of the world" scenario; the main reason why we went after Kralkatorrik despite the lack of a buffer was because he became such an imminent threat. And it's high time we get some chill going on and not constant urgency-after-urgency-after-urgency. So a plot that is not a top priority would be a nice, immediate focus for us to handle as it gives players a chance to ease down - the rollercoaster effect, basically, which is essential to plot developments.
---
   * In terms of Elder Dragons, Primordus and Jormag are still asleep, and the DSD is still MIA. So in terms of continuing the Elder Dragon plot, this seems like the most logical step baring some out of left field (re)intro of one of those three Elder Dragons.
---
   * Following this plot would also allow us to bring in Malyck, the Pale Tree and how it got cleansed of Mordremoth's control at some unknown time in the past, and the nature of the Dream/Nightmare - all questions left unanswered by HoT.
---
   * In addition to the above, last year around April, Matthew Medina had begun drafting out a plot for Malyck's return that worked. Around the same time, ArenaNet was drafting the finale of Season 4. Unless Malyck is to return in the next set of raids, or a Side Story chain, then the most logical time and place for Malyck to return given this would be Season 5. Granted, Matthew Medina was among the devs let go earlier this year, and we don't even know what state that drafting was left in, only that it had begun and was being worked on last year.
---
* As for the charr-human treaty situation, I feel that is a natural thing to delve into next as our immediate "non-ED plot" just as the White Mantle were such. Reasons being:
---
   * We've been getting a **LOT** of references to Bangar as of late, and charr in general really. Bangar had *one* reference in lore until Rytlock: Requiem came out, and that was in a pre-release blog lore post. Then after Rytlock: Requiem came, we had nearly a quarter dozen NPCs added referencing Bangar.
---
   * Since Episode 2, we've been getting an increase of charr lore in general. From Olmakhan, to Claw of the Khan-Ur, to the Iron Legion's involvement in All or Nothing, to the aforemention spread of Bangar lore.
---
   * With the established lore, it just makes sense for the relations to strain. The peace talks is barely 13 years old, and was only established because the Ascalonian charr forces were surrounded on all sides by multiple threats. Making peace with humans was intended to reduce the threats by 1 and add allies by 1. Those non-human threats being: Ogres, Foefire, Branded, and Flame Legion. With CoF and S1, the Flame Legion are broken, with S4 the branded will be broken, with S3 the Separatists were broken, and with S2 and a time of calm for Rytlock to re-attempt the Foefire Cleansing ritual, the Foefire ghosts will be broken, leaving just the ogres and the renegades. And there's suggestions planted in Fields of Ruin that the renegades are primarily Blood Legion soldiers - soldiers of Bangar who's called a wildcard and has immense hatred of humanity.
---
   * Lastly, the world map in the gw.dat expands eastward. East, towards the Blood Citadel where Bangar rules.
---
As such, in the end, all we need is a Foefire Cleansing coming about from Sohothin being given up (hinted with Rytlock:Requiem) or Magdaer finally being fixed to spark a potential Bangar-led revolt. Leading to a charr-centric variation of the Season 3 situation where we deal with charr politics and civil war, while dealing with the aftermath of two Elder Dragons.
---
seems like will need to invest and can't change to a condi build until i've farmed more gold
---
Personally, though there's a handful of suggestions indicating Menzies was killed offscreen (if so, sad and missed opportunities), I think if they bring back Menzies at this point it'd be as a raid wing similar to Dhuum.
---
The more i see this, the more i want it.
---
But i don't think i will craft it sadly, i already have both sunrise and twilight[sold eternity because i just wanted those 2 skins and i crafted 2 other leggy with that money], and i don't use gs as much as i want..
---
Also, i'm focusing on making at least 1 legendary weapons per type, and i still miss a couple to complete the set, but after that, i may focus on this and astralaria because they looks AWESOME
---
Ah shit, here we go again...
---
Seriously it looks good, but the if the grinding is like the Requiem i'll be lazy and just do the precursor version for this one.
---
Is your autotargeting turned off?
---
Pretty mild criticism, and downvoting is not meant to be for simple dislike.
---
I always suggest gearing a power DPS first as it gets you quickly into content with a good build instead of trying to save up and make due with bad stats. Depending on your interests that gearing guide as suggestions on getting ascended armor which I do suggest if gearing a condition damage build since the exotics for viper (and harrier/diviner) cost a lot. It's better to put that cost towards ascended rather than expensive temporary gear.
---
I'm glad to hear you've come around. I know a lot of people don't like Caithe and were especially annoyed with her behavior in S2 and even through HoT. Some have never changed their view of her even after she apologized to the Commander and is working to improve their relationship in order to regain their trust. As someone who has been in an abusive relationship, and seen those sorts of tactics firsthand, I gradually got attached to her more as I became aware of the abuse in my own life. And having gone through PS so many times now, I can see that when the Commander goes through the vision of Orr, sees each member of Destiny's Edge- sees Caithe, that I knew she was so tired it felt like she could just.. fall back to a life with her abuser again.  
---
And Faolain deserved everything she got, in the end. She truly was a monster, inside, and then outside. It was a great and clever metaphor for exposing the monster she truly is - her true colors (at least way more blatantly than before). It's hard to really notice unless (usually, in many cases) you've been exposed to something like that. Faolain was a classic narc.
---
So needless to say, seeing a survivor of abuse as a major character doing her best to find her place in the world, while very few people truly understand or even trust her, is not only refreshing, it's validating. I know what that's like. I need characters like Caithe to live and thrive and show other survivors that they're strong too. Caithe is very needed.
---
cheers, i shall work on ascended as it seems easily changeable
---
Edited it for you :P like your version bettre xD
---
Firebrand and Scourge are both very in demand for zerging at the moment. I’m not familiar with that specific build, but exotics are all you need for WvW. Be aware that you won’t run zerker gear most of the time, it’s the one place in the game where tankier gear is really needed. I’m not familiar with Ehmry Bay. I’m on Borlis Pass, which gets linked mostly to Sea of Sorrows and Tarnished Coast.
---
Don't go!
---
Most survivability comes from Bulwark Gyro and its barrier. It has no cast time and can be used while stunned, there's no stopping it.
---
Is bubbles even recognized in game?
---
Most common questions are downvoted, especially if a comment has already provided the answer.  It's not personal, just keeps the sub clear for content - otherwise the entire front page would be questions.
---
Legendaries are pretty important to the high end economy though. I think they are worth the effort indefinitely.
---
Yeah, Taimi mentioned him but conveniently forgot his name
---
Do you need a renegade for the quickness build or is it fine as the only support? Or would it be better to start gearing my chrono for pug fractals?
---
If you're building it right now you might as well go thief.
---
Most pugs (at least in my experience) do end up just running a chrono to cover quickness + alacrity. The renegade covers alacrity while the firebrand covers quickness. If you can get both they will do more damage than having a chrono but, ya it might be hard to find a pug group.
---
List higher dailies whenever possible, ask for opener if needed, list progression groups the other time.
---
I don't disagree one bit.
---
I hope he realizes people make these jokes because they like the long videos, it’s the brand...a funny brand, but a brand
---
sell them
---
Oh, now I see it. Guess I was too tired to see properly. Thanks!
---
I think he does know it.

The GW2 community isn’t just reddit, lol. You could posted on the official forums, any of the numerous fan site forums, hell you could have just asked someone in game to explain the confusion for you. You got your feelings hurt cuz you said shit ppl don’t like and you’re giving “downvotes” so much unnecessary power. Sheesh, it’s definitely not that serious. Go play the game (or any game for that matter) until you figure the shit out. It’s not that complicated
---
I know. What I mean to say is that it's not as if they went all out on mace, or harpoon gun.
---
&gt; deep sea dragon created an event that changes all of Tyria.
---
if all of Tyria ends up underwater, I'm going to blame you for giving them the idea.
---
Or it's the money they save in salaries
---
For the consume vs trade, trade is better due to the expected distribution of magic gained on consumption giving you less then 250 magic for your 60 ore.
---
Seen several references to selling the ore straight up though, might be worth checking what your profit per bag is and comparing it to the sell price of the ore. Seems daft if that is the best option though.
---
Some people say, that is you ask ANet really nice over an e-mail they might return you the extra money:) Worth a try
---
When you’re first learning the build, I’d recommend using the practice golems &amp; NPC on the Easter island of the PvP lobby. Once you’re comfortable killing NPCs, hop into unranked, until you feel ready to swap back into ranked.
---
reminds me of the old unkillable druids, or guardians.
---
Oh you capped the point first? well..GG, no point in trying.
---
Since it's usually a pretty big weapon you have a bit more space to "have fun" with than on a Dagger or a Torch is my main guess to why they seem to get more love.
---
not trying to be to negative here, but you normaly compare to the SAME quarter in the last year. So as i buisness you would see a DECLINE. (for obvious reasons, expac)
---
I think the usage of the different tomes could be difficult. How to learn this?
---
Sales =/= profit. Sales is the amount before all the expenses such as salaries. Sales tells us the selling power of the products.
---
I'm shocked it doesn't say "General Kenobi" on the second line
---
I second the progression group. I did it a few time when I was close-ish to a new tier and it was nice both pretty fun (because people will not strictly join for reward like they do for "Daily Tx" LFGs) and you also get to (re)practice some fractals you may be a bit less confortable with right before changing tier.
---
I think the answer is to practice.
---
That’s not really all that great news put in that perspective..
---
I mean what even IS Lineage I if there’s a Lineage II and I is beating out GW2? I’m genuinely curious.
---
If it's happening in the Mists, Trahearne and Kormir should come and steal kill together.
---
I have made the same mistake as you in the past unfortunately and putting an upgrade in an exotic gear performs roughly the same background process as equipping it thus rendering it soulbound (so I feel you on this one :p). Be mindful that iirc most Viper gear that you can craft are account-bound anyway so the only thing you will be able to do is put them in a bank to to transfer them to another character of this account but not send it via mail/guild bank to another account.
---
kralk on this pic reminds me of [this](https://en.meming.world/images/en/thumb/e/e2/Crying_Cat_screaming.jpg/300px-Crying_Cat_screaming.jpg)
---
I think the ore us also used to craft the stellar and astral weapons, if you like collecting skins
---
Ask in map chat for someone to open t3 Fractals for you in LFG. As long as you're partied with someone who has it unlocked, you can open it and list/join a group after they leave.
---
The kill stealer is Kormir
---
It is a small increase but normally you compare the same quarters, 1Q 2018 = 23k, 1Q 2019 = 16k, that's a huge decrease. Hopefully a good expansion and good marketing will do the trick in 1Q 2020.
---
Have you finished gathering the materials you need to make it yet? It was cool running into you at Malchor's Leap the other day.
---
I predict an ancient Dragon Lieutenant from the previous time they rose and destroyed the world.
---
Well right now im very poor after crafting my first ever ascended set so i kinda need the gold more than anything
---
A lot of "hey I'm back, what I missed" and similar posts are downvoted as we see like a few of them EVERYDAY. A lot asking the same kind of questions, and most often can be answered if they made an effort to look. 
---
In your other post you sounded a little entitled, like you expected WvW to have remained the same. Thing is you took a break, and on that break mounts got added, I guess you just need to deal with it and catch up. It doesn't take very long to get the mount and then you can easily keep up with the comnander
---
Like Pharus x.x   
---
God was actually so dissapointed..
---
The next expansion will be in 2021 at the earliest. We will go straight into season 5 and it will last until the end of 2020.
---
Not like the entire front page is full of "I did my first world completion" posts most of the times
---
Taimi interacts with Bobblehead Laboratory and nothing changes...
---
Depends on the game mode I guess.
---
But that doesn't change the fact it's image isn't very liked, I for one have yet to see one ingame…   
---
Sure the anims and sound can be cool but at the end of the day it's a meme ship gun and looks are very important in this game to most players
---
I think i found a new skin for Eternity
---
without new leg t5 and t6 mats and mith/elder will drop significantly over time, which is also a huge part of the income of regular players
---
It's crazy expensive to fire people in the short run
---
Characters that got killed in the past, stayed dead (Sir, Trahearne).
---
But yeah bringing back Aurene would be a terrible decision. I am glad she is dead and I hope she stays dead
---
Mesmer here, what kind of effect would that be? We don't really leave footfalls and the spell effects are VERY pink from mesmer. I don't recognize that effect at all
---
Lineage 2 overtaking Lineage? What's happening?
---
A few years ago Lineage 2 made like 1/10 of the original.
---
He actually did announce that he knew and explained why he knew. In general he hasn't know what will happen and much of his speculation didn't happen.
---
If you want to ask random questions and not getting downvotes for, just use the freaking [question thred](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bkkyv3/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_may_04_2019/)!
---
We're just trying to keep the start page clean for phone pics of world completes and tribble posts of the newest trailers
---
what's up with that huge drop by half of lineage this quarter?
---
An hour long cutscene should play at 1% health showing Trahearne and Kormir slow walking from a mist portal, all the while Trahearne keeps saying 'This won't end well, for you!'. 
---
After they reach Kralkatorrik they punch it bunch of times to kill it and Kormir becomes a dragon-god. Trahearne beckons to the Commander, 'Commander, a word.' but doesn't say anything. Then the Commander understands, that Commander was indeed a word.
---
I do Dodge when I see the markers. Other than that I can't really Dodge 3 melee attackers and cast spells.
---
Don’t worry about being blamed for making mistakes, anything lower than Gold 3 is pretty much a bunch of people whom either don’t play often enough, play multiple classes for fun, or are still working on getting good with a class.
---
I suggest you mess around with the golems a bit and just do some unranked, after a few matches move to ranked (for better rewards) as long as you don’t care about your rank all that much.
---
glhf
---
Give fish now, keep nassssty chips.
---
just kite them, melee attackers can't reach you
---
Normally you could go to the golem, like mentioned belowe. Unfortunately,  the firebrand mantra bunker spec is a pvp support build, so it would be useless to go to the golem. This is a fun build to play, but I would recommend to try not stick to this build as it is a support build and a team only really need 1 support player in genereal. 
---
Best way to learn this build, is to learn what all the skills do (especially those with resistance)
---
Just jump in ranked or unranked and try sticking close to the rest of the team. (never solo or roam, this build doesn't have dps)  
---
A small part of the pvp community is toxic so don't pay to much attention to the blame game.
---
Tbh Pharus in general was a major dissapointment imo, quite un-original and lack of effects only adds salt to the wound
---
K, but what about ranged? Can't really Dodge the autohit basics they fire.
---
Lineage I has a steady devoted playerbase who prefer it over the sequel - it's kinda like with GW1 but they're more active. Recently NCSoft switched it from subscription to [what seems to be](https://www.mmobomb.com/news/lineage-entering-free-play-south-korea-sort/) GW2's buy to play model.
---
I know, I saw the announcement, still made all his speculations untrustworthy because he DID KNOW. Whether he botched it all on purpose or not isn't even important rly, we'll never know and the magic is just gone.
---
In Raids you will need them. 
---
Gliding 6
---
(Itzel 6 not necessary but useful)
---
Nuhoch 4
---
Raids 3
---
For fractals
---
At least Fractal attunement 2 so you can upgrade your rings.
---
Besides these ancient Magics 4 is very useful it heals you in downstead for a percentage of damage dealt and gives you a knock back skill
---
Won't happen. They told us already they don't have the maps and assets anymore. Can't cite the source because it was hella long ago but maybe someone can post a link here if they find it.
---
Giving her a new look by making her own brand. Then giving her voice so she could speak with us and then kill her ? Maybe she might not be able to move when she is spiked but I belive she will keep helping us like her mother did since now.
---
There was people leaving other MMOs tho, not neciserilly proof of GW2 doing anything
---
Consuming it will give you almost nothing . I ate 250 and got around 600 magic I belive. So always use it for buying materials or any other items in the map. I belive there is a tonic you can buy and a lot of minis.
---
To be fair it's worse than same time last year... It's better than last Q but it's WAY worse than last year. Aka it declined
---
Got to love Steve
---
There is that unused square between Rata Sum and the Grove.
---
the roaming death ball thief required map, oh boy. lack of any kind of objective to fight over meant that teams stalemated at the start, and then once one team started winning they could just spawn camp the other team because the other team had a timer to leave the base or be forced out. so you were spawned outside one of the base exits before the rest of their team can respawn and so your team can never recover. because everybody has different death timers.
---
Taimi was super proud of her dragon's nest and excited to see if Aurene's gonna like it, wouldn't be surprised if she asked for it to be transported near the body. Braham going all this way to bring the stuff from refuge also gets props from me.
---
simple: stop with the skinner box design
---
Was going to say she never got to use her new nest
---
Did you consider having the warrior tank the Hydra?
---
This is a little bit too accurate
---
I love to hear him talk as well. Use most if his videos as podcasts for work.
---
You would too if you were making more money the longer you dragged out videos.
---
I quite like him but I think he over does it sometimes, when any YouTuber gives up their job to do YouTube full time I feel like they all change a bit anyway and it becomes about the money rather than doing something as a hobby.
---
This is what happens when someone is really enthusiastic about something. I was somewhat the same a couple of years back. A walking/talking lore nerd who could talk hours about GW1 and 2 lore.
---
But you only can craft legendary precursors once! So better make a backup Eternity.
---
You also have to take into consideration that Q1 2018 was the first quarter after after PoF dropped in Q4 2017.
---
A more fair comparison would be Q1 2017, one year out from the first quarter after HoT dropped in Q4 2015.
---
HoT made 37.3 bln korean wan in Q4 2015 and 30.5 bln in Q1 2016 (19% decrease), dropping all the way to 14.2 bln a year later in Q1 2017 (53% decrease).
---
PoF made 34.9 bln in Q4 2017 and 23.6 bln in Q1 2018 (32% decrease), dropping down to the current 16.3 bln (31% decrease).
---
Meaning that a little over a year and a half out from their respective releases, HoT had lost 62% of its quarterly revenue while PoF has lost 53%. While PoF had a faster drop off after the expansion released compared to HoT, it's kept revenue up somewhat better as time has gone on.
---
HoT had two really good quarters, then had a huge dropoff followed by continual slow decline. PoF has had one really good quarter, then a smaller dropoff, then a series of dips and small increases.
---
Surprisingly, GW2 has had slightly more revenue during the lifespan of PoF than it did in the same time frame of HoT: 131.4 bln from Q4 2017 to Q1 2019 compared to 128.2 bln from Q4 2015 to Q1 2017.
---
We'll just have to see if PoF continues to hold relatively steady like it has been, without any news of an upcoming expansion to inject some hype into the playerbase.
---
I have a notion, based on the new trailer, that the survivors might be trapped in the cave after that blast, but we end up finding a rift that Kralk made when he left and follow him out into the mists, eventually popping back out in the new map.
---
It really depends on how it's done. Even without Joko (which by logic it shouldn't). Vlast's body was destroyed, unlike Glint's and Aurene's, and unlike Aurene's, Glint's body is old and decayed for a decade - not in good condition for a resurrection (though I suppose that does make her a valid candidate for new Elder Death Dragon...).
---
If the method of resurrection used requires intact soul and body, then Vlast and arguably Glint are nullified of prospect using it. Though there are methods of resurrection that can recreate the body (Shiro did it, others should be able to). There's also the notion of if Vlast wanted to return - he was suffering from depression as easily shown by his memory crystals. He may not want to return to life to "fulfill his duty" that was tossed upon him.
---
It would be nice if Vlast returns, but I think Glint's time has come and gone at this point. Resurrecting the whole family would be a bit much. If they do intend to resurrect both crystal children or all three, then I'd rather they resurrect Aurene in War Eternal and have her replace Kralkatorrik, then while searching for replacements for Zhaitan and Mordremoth in Season 5, manage to resurrect Vlast (and Glint).
---
But given the Guild Chat talk on the Skyscale, I suspect that we'll be finding viable candidates another method. Maybe even for Kralkatorrik.
---
You guys do know you can customize the log-in screen music right?
---
Less than a week in to Path of Fire's release I noped out of that sedate track and went right back to HoT's theme.

This meta sounds much more fun that right now

you're reading to much into this

Yeah, a few times we've heard about it, but they've never said the name.
---
They even lampshade and shitpost the NPCs knowing the name but "suddenly forgetting":

[Nanacatl](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nanacatl), [Bullablopp](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bullablopp), and [Master Sdias](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Master_Sdias) talk about the DSD's presence in the Unending Ocean.
---
[Here we have some Inquest talking about a DSD's minion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Coil_Reactor#Ambient_dialogue).
---
Then in story steps we have:
---
&gt;**Riel Darkwater**: One down, four to go. May they never see us coming until it's too late!  
---
  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*Zhaitan has fallen, \[...\] and there are four more Elder Dragons to contend with.*  
---

---
&gt;(Note: The one not mentioned here is Mordremoth, which wasn't yet awake.)
---
During  [City of Hope](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/City_of_Hope), we face minions of every Elder Dragon, instead of the DSD's there are water spouts the Commander comments on:
---
**If asuran:** What are these waterspouts? They're salt water.
---
**If charr:** Waterspouts? What? Hmm, salty.
---
**If sylvari:** Salt water? What the...
---
**If norn:** Is that the smell of brine? Mixed with the smell of blood.
---
**If human:** I smell the ocean.
---
(it's kind of curious the norn smell blood with it, when even the charr doesn't.)
---
&gt;**Pact Commander:** *Who's S?*  
---
&gt;**Historian:** Don't know any more than that. That was all they could get from the Tome of the Five True Gods. It's too damaged. Some of these scholars in here would kill to know the full name of that dragon.  
---
&gt;**Pact Commander:** *Is it the deep sea dragon?*  
---
&gt;**Historian:** They think so. Me, I think they probably got the letter wrong, but who knows. They're still translating and trying to fill in lost pieces.

---
And of course the numerous cases of witnessing The All has shown us the existence of the sixth Elder Dragon (and that there is only six).
---
There's more than this to go off of too, this is just the lion's share of deets.
---
There are 2 sets of “glorious” PvP armor... (yes it IS confusing).
---
One set is the “Glorious Armor” and comes from the reward track (similar to the wvw tier 1 armor unlocks).
---
*This armor does NOT tier 1 unlock to allow purchase of mistforged armor.
---
The other set is called “Glorious Hero Armor” (it is hidden set in wardrobe) and was only attainable through mAT wins.
---
*The GHA does tier 1 unlock for the mistforged (in place of the Ardent sets you can buy).
---
If you did not win a monthly automated tourney (in old days) you could not get tier 1 unlocked so the other way to acquire tier 1 unlocks is the Ardent PvP set (or skins).
---
As I said... the sharing the same name thing was a mistake from anet and has caused some general confusion but you can’t really get the GHA skin anymore (now they give novelties for mAT wins) so don’t worry about it. It’s not currently attainable and is “hidden” in the wardrobe anyway. 
---
If you just want the glorious armor skin just do reward track it’s pretty fast, and good luck!
---
Why would you want to limit addicting factors in MMORPGs tho. Online games are supposed to to keep your attention as long as they can. If your goal is different then you should just go for single player because it would be much cheaper to develop and return would be much greater.
---
Take a look at the legendary armors from raids, those have transformation effects.
---
it was never a question of "can they bring aurene back?" but " **should** they bring aurene back?"
---
it's their story, they can do whatever
---
and Cherise Boothe as Zafirah
---
There's three issues to make it possible or not:
---
1. Joko's magic doesn't matter. When Elder Dragons, Aurene, and demigods consume magic, they convert it to their flavor. It's only when an Elder Dragon or former god has died that the consuming dragon gained a new type of magic. If this wasn't the case, then Primordus would be having asura gate magic for the past 200 years, having consumed six asuran cities including the Central Transfer Chamber. As Joko wasn't a demigod or "high dragon" (for lack of a better term of whatever Aurene is), there's no reason that Aurene would gain that ability anyways.
---
2. There's no reason to believe souls can become Elder Dragons. Since we know Glint is in the Mists, it's reasonable to believe Zhaitan and Mordremoth's souls are there too somewhere. Why wouldn't they still be Elder Dragons if souls could be such?
---
3. Lastly, Aurene's body is void of magic. Now granted it's also void of her soul, but when Glint died her magic remained for a time in her corpse - same with Zhaitan - and slowly seeped out (it's unclear with Mordremoth just how artistic that finale cinematic truly is; we know there was no true explosion of magic since the Pact didn't go insane from magic overdose, and an entire year passed by before Primordus, the Bloodstone, and Kralkatorrik became active with new types of magic). The fact Aurene has no magic in her corpse implies Kralkatorrik consumed it - and Kralkatorrik consumes souls too. But baring the consumption of Aurene's soul, that would still put her to ground zero with magical ability and capability to replace an Elder Dragon. Glint would be far more likely as a replacement at this point if souls can do so.
---
Overall, plausible, but imo unlikely.
---
&gt;The % chance that Anet was so keen on small details like this is almost 0. 
---
Yet the grand hint that Lazarus was actually Balthazar, was the fact that there was a White Mantle warrior in the cinematic where "Lazarus" shows up wielding a Balthazar Shield.
---
Small detail is exactly how ArenaNet hides their hints and foreshadowing.
---
It probably isn't much, but honestly, given past record, I dunno.
---
&gt; don't shoot me if I'm wrong
---
Dont worry Im gonna shoot you even if you are right. That's why I made my Predator &lt;3 
---
I dont belive that we should get Aurene back. Not their physical body at least. Maybe a voice in our head telling us what to do. The same way we had her mother. Or we will get Aurene as ghost. We already seen Eir and Snap as ghosts helping us in our real world so why not Aurene ?
---
Go look into gear and builds from highlvl content.
---
Read them and estimate wich parts you can adapt for your level. For starters you want Power equip with added Precision and Ferocity later on higher levels.
---
As Elementalist you want to use Scepter as mainhand for it gives good damage and way more versetility compared to Staff or Dagger. Scepter is also Endgame Weapon of choice on Tempests so get a feeling for it.
---
Train into Fire, Arcane and Lightning to deal proper damage and wear corresponding equipment.
---
Healing is only needed in highlvl endgame content and leveling a healer in MMOs was never the fastest way for open worlds / quests to begin with.
---
Always glad to help!
---
And as I said earlier.. Welcome to the Octopus Armor Club!!
---
And ohh your gonna love dying the tendrils... Some colors like permafrost standout big time or the cursed Shadow Abyss (which actually makes the tendrils glow purple haha so fun).. Also some golds or reds and blues are just sooo nice (sick green or orange at Halloween).
---
Yah Grats man, big (early) congrats!
---
Yes but you have outdated map. If they would want to point out something then they would update the map as well so we would notice that it maybe means something. As you said yourself with White Mantle Warrior and the Shield. They were no old props . What would you want Logan to do in the trailer ? He is a Pact commander now. He needs to have strategy and how better to do that ? Over a map.  But maybe you are right and maybe not. I just wouldnt get my hopes up because of this. You are trying to find any little detail just because you can.
---
Not really by a massive amount, which is shocking compared to how popular we assume GW2 to be. 
---
I mean in terms of population I think a lot of people would assume GW2 to be top ten, in terms of revenue I doubt it is compared to a lot of other games.
---
I actually don't think we will fight any other dragons I think season 5 will be dealing with Kralks death (if we kill hi of course). I think we either kill kralk and magic goes mental and we need to find a way to stop it this would allow Anet to expand current maps in season 5 with the areas dealing with the magic imbalance. Or I think we may get the gods storyline if you remember a month before the sad layoffs at Anet they were showing the wiki posts for the gods on twitter. I think season 4 ends with Kralky dying and us having convinced the gods to come back and maybe gather the dragons magic.
---
With season 3s finale they gave us the episode date a week before the trailer it seems they did the same but said coming in May instead.
---
We know the maps on Tyria because Anet have said that to get the skyscale we need to collect scales on the new map on Tyria.
---
The idea of bringing Aurene back has been up there since the very moment we saw her death. She ate Palawa Joko after all.
---
Both the last trailer and the new mount point to her return in my opinion.
---
Trailer: You still see aurene in the same crystalized state when she died. Nobody buried her or anything. Take it as a hint of "waiting for something to happen".

New mount: Call it skyscale if you want. It's a dragon. It points to towards the idea of riding aurene during the last episode. It wouldn't surprise me that to unlock the new mount you would have to play the first instance, aurene "resurrects" and you get to ride on her. And no, we won't get aurene's skin for the new mount for free (except for the story instances). That would probably be a gemstore purchase, but i would be very glad to see it as the reward of the meta achievement or some independent collection.
---
If the lore of the new mount isn't tied to aurene's resurrection or if she doesn't resurrect at all i'm probably going to be very angry, specially for the second part.
---
I still want Kralkatorrik to die in a Fractal loop. Since he's so intent on manipulating the mists, it would be poetry if the mists itself is what defeats him.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Elder Dragon Version.
---
Arguable. There is also a map of Elona in the same style, but no existing map of Tyria and Elona. So if they wanted to point to somewhere in Elona, they'd use that. If they wanted to point to somewhere in Tyria, they'd use the one they did. If they just needed a map, they could have used the map of Eternal Battlegrounds or Queensdale or Silverwastes for all anyone cares.
---
So I'm not sure the choice of map acts against it.
---
Also, the Balthazar Shield was added in 2015, used in 2017. So yes, that was also an old prop.
---
As for what would Logan do - there's many ways to depict discussing strategy without pointing to a map. Even just discussing - without pointing - over the map would show that.
---
&gt;You are trying to find any little detail just because you can. 
---
So? Is that so wrong to do? Dozens of people expect and ask of this out of Wooden Potatoes whenever a teaser comes out. Why can't others?
---
There's always a bigger fish
---
Or, pet theory, because the number 5 as in the fifth dragon kinda looks like the letter S.
---
But you COULD be fire
---
Selbbub
---
You may not like it but that's how the vast majority of people are anymore.
---
Heck I was talking to my younger cousin the other day and he showed me a vid of one of the teachers assistants saying they need to get rid of the Socratic method because of some BS about racism.
---
&gt;If the lore of the new mount isn't tied to aurene's resurrection or if she doesn't resurrect at all i'm probably going to be very angry, specially for the second part.
---
So you would be angry if something you pulled out of your ass didn't turn out true? Seems rather weird surely? There is no indication whatsoever that the Skyscale is in any way or form connected to Aurene.
---
You could, but you lose out on all the buffs druid provides on top of that, so it'll be harder to build a group around you.
---
Finally a worth trailer for end of Season 4. Pog
---
Good luck to everyone involved and thank you for organizing this spectacle.

---
There are several NA guilds that do the Dragon's Stand meta every day. Keep an eye on the event timer on the wiki, and start checking LFG about 10 minutes before the new meta starts, or just go to the starting WP of Dragon's Stand and ask if a meta group is forming. People still run DS all the time, I promise.
---
The only thing druid actually provides now that others don't is frost spirit.
---
Otherwise every other healer can provide all the same buffs.
---
Guard also has the advantage of applying AEGIS &amp; quickness (Top dps groups actually use them + renegade for alacrity then drop mesmer completely)
---
The only down side to guard healing is its almost all melee range.
---
Yes and we have 1 map per Living Story episode . We already know that we will be getting a map in The Mists wich means that we will not be getting a new map in Tyria. So why would Logan be pointing out around The Grove ? Even if there would be a portal into The Mists, Logan couldnt know that in advance.
---
I never raised in gw2. What does a party comp look like? 2 healers 2 tanks 3 dps? Ect.
---
It has an fgs so another gs is quite unlikely to happen.
---
Feels bad when it says in the guide you suck compared to druid still lmaooo
---
K they just must not be doing it when I'm on.
---
I mainly play late evenings &amp; nites.
---
The usual pug group consits of 2 chronos, 1 warrior, 1 druid, 1 heal or dps, 5 dps
---
There is no fixed "tank" role in this game, and when you do need something like a "tank", that role is usually filled by one of the supports, so you have 3-4 supports and the rest of the group are DPS.
---
Sorry but it's beyond me why anyone would take a day off for a Living World episode. I get it, it's the finale, and I'm hyped too, but a 1,5 hour long story and some map-wide events do not worth a whole day's focus. If you play 2-3 hours every evening even on workdays, still you will complete the relaese 100% in max 2 weeks.
---
&gt; We already know that we will be getting a map in The Mists wich means that we will not be getting a new map in Tyria.
---
I got some news for you:
---
&gt; I have a rule about Living World maps being present on the overworld parchment. Doesn't mean we won't go into the Mists, but a main open world map in the Mists is unlikely.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/687511#Comment_687511
---
The map is 100% in Tyria.
---
&gt; So why would Logan be pointing out around The Grove ?
---
No clue. That's why I brought it up for discussion.
---
Look here for all the boosters you can apply. Don't forget the guild one!
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW\_Reward\_Track#Reward\_track\_modifiers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW_Reward_Track#Reward_track_modifiers)
---
\&gt; Are there any groups that still do dragons stand ?
---
In EU the two later evening slots seem to go very well. I hadn't even realised this could be a problem!
---
That's quality armor!
---
That was my thought when we saw all the mish-mash of assets, that it would be like Jahai with the rifts, but everywhere.
---
as Zos said.
---
But that is because pug groups are unorganized.
---
A 5 man group usually has 1 healer, 1 buffer then 3 dps.
---
The optimal set up uses a rev or guard healer with the other one providing alacrity or quickness. Its optimal because they can fill in the missing buff while doing more dps then a mesmer would.
---
Mesmers however have larger aoe effects for their buffs and are more forgiving hence why most groups use them.
---
For 10 mans you pretty much copy it again but make sure one of the healers is a druid as their buffs unlike others are 10 man capped.
---
Keep in mind, Kralk has been in the Domain of the Lost eating souls very recently -- it would NOT be a rehash of the same instance, it'd be purple.
---
Take a look
---
Well done mate
---
As others (ZC321, for ex) mentioned, Firebrand does indeed do a good job healing and offers some nice types of boons. It pairs especially well with an alacrity renegade. I believe some static raid groups design for this combo, as preference over the old fashioned druid+chrono combo. But, if you're jumping into pugs (random pick up groups) on a week-to-week basis you might have a hard time finding a good renegade partner. Plus, the wider community is slow to accept changes; some changes to druid, FB, and renegade only occurred in the last couple months.
---
If you think you like the style and feel of Firebrand, I'd say go with Firebrand! Your happiness and skill will a class should be more important than just questioning how quickly you can queue. Firebrand is also one of the best healers for WvW (maybe even \*the\* top-meta?), because there boons like stability are especially valuable.
---
On point. Add it to GW2style if not already.
---
Vessel...wait, vessel for what magic exactly? And, Vessel Ascension? Are you talking about uh, the sort of process Kormir went though when she made the choice only a mortal can make? For Balthazar? Aurene? 
---
Dude, I'm a little bit fuzzy on the details, but it's a cool idea. Though, if this is the plot, you can be absolutely sure Caithe is gonna jump in and steal our divinity from under our noses. Always stealing the cool shit, my sneaky plant waifu
---
You didn't "miss" anything. There was no option to create a free account until August 2015.
---
I used to watch him a lot but recently it started to bug me how much he forgets or misinterprets completely. ( Deepstone Dwarven architecture-&gt; is this Cantha ?!! )
---
He can make mistakes obviously, everyone does, but for a lore enthusiast he sometimes manages to get the most basic things wrong and at that point it’s just more frustrating having him ramble for 10 minutes about his false interpretation. 
---
He’s still entertaining from time to time though.
---
Yeah, they both love their cryptic references, and in the livestream, there was uh, a lot of like, sly looks and veiled hints, this would, imo, totally be the sort of thing they'd do. "Oh yes, this is NOT the new map, this is the most obscure corner of Desert Highlands, nothing going on here"
---
It definitely is the blanket, with a luxurious pillow I’d say as well. Plus the lily you can get. It makes it worse for Taimi as it’s the items she put effort into for Aurene, who never got to appreciate them fully. 
---
It’s the small details that breaks your heart.
---
Thanks, I really do love firebrands animations. And I feel like guardian might get monk specialization later down the road which would complete me xD 
---
I just hope I can raid without troubles, only reason I wanna play gw2 tbh
---
Thank you!! I have too many cosplays to make to have time with that unfortunatly, perhaps at a later point:D! If anyone wanna make a gw2style page for this though, then feel free to message me on reddit and ill provide some help:)
---
If you want to learn to play a class for pvp, the best way to learn is to play pvp. You'll end up getting yelled at even if you're doing a good job. (I had this experience once... I beasted as support but got flamed by one guy who still for some reason thought I sucked. Ended up blocking him.) Like others suggested, play against the NPCs in the pvp lobby, but make sure to go into actual matches, because playing against people is obviously much different.
---
When you do begin actual matches, be sure to communicate with your team. Matches tend to turn out better when everyone talks to each other. Ignore the salt that will come when you make mistakes. Just do your best. Good luck!
---
Gonna check it out. I mostly use the closest vista.
---
Someone please alert me when this music drops somewhere-- anywhere!  I need it! XD
---
For gw2 I would say cpu.
---
Right now yes. Day by day more pugs will accept you as second healer though. You could always try to find a guild that will accept you as heal quickbrand.
---
When anyone gets the music posted up somewhere, I wanna know about it!  I need that shtuff XD
---
I downvoted because you sounded entitled af.   
---
Instead of literally using google and checking out how the mount was added and how it was obtained you decided to go QQ on reddit about it.   
---
???
---
Am not free to feel angry about something?
---
In any case that doesn't mean i discard the posibility that anet can give me a good suprise even if it's not what i expected. It could help me to alleviate the sorrow.
---
The game is poorly optimised, better specs won't give you much better performance. Especially in crowded areas like WvW and LA.
---
I upgraded from a 960 and an i5 4460 to a 1660ti and an i5 8400 and while I could set some things to max, I still get low frames in high traffic places. It's just how it is
---
&gt;Exactly, when I OC'ed mine 2500K from stock 3,3GHz to 4,5GHz it helped with about 5-7 more fps on average.
---
From my experience in training raids the requirement to stay over 90% health is way harder to maintain than just standing behind or at the side of a boss.
---
We could always do something interesting, like making ascended soup with our grandmaster cook.
---
If downvotes hurt your feelings so much that you have to create a post about it, why not just use the wiki https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warclaw and avoid the possible pain?
---
This is likely not going to happen, but ANet could totally troll a lot of people by changing the recipe for it to something totally different than the other gen2. People already bought the mats, economy already got rid of all that liquid currency, probably many already made gifts and sucked out thousands of crafting mats from the game, and then they drop that they have to basically spend double, heh.
---
Honestly I feel most addictions are more a sign of problems in life and escaping them. Improve the quality of life and mental health of them and they will likely shift to better practices. If someone actively enjoys their job instead of hating every moment they are working they are less inclined to avoid it. If people are feeling good in themselves then they are generally going to have a more balanced life.
---
With children games are just a newer form of TV where parents neglect their children and keep them amused with it instead of actually parenting and having limitations, rules and structure. If a child is playing too many games that it is causing problems that is on the parent. The child is still too young to know better.
---
Also where do you draw the line, I mean games have good and bad aspects. It could be that one weekend a group of friends are playing games together loads then another they are doing sports or going on a trip. Some people use games as a social platform to catch up with friends who live too far away to easily meet up. There are all sorts of things that could be flagged as problematic but are actually still balanced. Heck are charity streams that go on for 24hours that raise loads of money for a good cause something that we should punish?
---
The best things to counter would be gambling problems with money (loot boxes) which causes a lot of problems, not doing overly explotive mechanics that work on actually building addictive patterns (often skinner boxes) and generally improving the mental well being of people so they don't need to escape life as a release and instead of doing it to explore (just like any other medium of fiction like films, books etc).
---
While looking at general "video game addictions" that honestly seems to be able to be applied to anything even things that don't have a more negative view from outside. If you applied them to sports you wouldn't get the negative reaction really and you would in fact have a likely professional in the making (if they started young enough with good genes (no conditions that prevent a person from doing them), good diet and such). If you applied it to learning you would have a scholar that might change the world. If you apply it to basically any hobby that is viewed positively you have something as an end goal but apply it to anything seen as negative that is meant to be for enjoyment then it is a problem. Would reading for recreation be problematic? Would socialising (with or without alcohol) be problematic? It seems a lot of negativity comes from how it is something newer being targetted often technological. While I agree somethings exploit people, I wouldn't say that just because someone does something a lot means it is always a problematic element that should be punished and as such any method to punish people would also hit those that are actually not needing to be punished (and should punishment be dealt out in such a way in the first place?)
---
Summary:
---
Honestly I feel most behavior problems are caused by other factors. If someone isn't enjoying life and just living for the sake of living they are much more likely to do whatever they can to escape from such a life, this can be seen as addictions or worse (like self-harm or suicide). If someone has a "good" life then they wouldn't need to escape it. Instead of cracking down on problematic elements people might go towards (thus further limiting enjoyment in life and just shifting to another "problematic hobby"), you should work towards improving quality of life, ease of access to mental health and support people so they can live a balanced life without just labelling any hobby that is more for recreation as an addiction. As for children, thats down to parenting. A child doesn't know about balance and if you shove them down in front of anything to amuse them you shouldn't be suprised when they end up using it for hours on end.
---
Really cause I have tried and several of them are gated off till the meta is done
---
&gt; Are there any where your head swells up ?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvE6xupP3Mg
---
This could be - and likely is in my opinion - correct. However, I am still hoping for a map in The Mists.
---
Dad? Is that you!
---
TBH, a lot of what was said in that thread *were* details that don't exist. There's no way they had planned the finale events of Season 4 when they Season 2 mid-season-finale cinematic, and the interpretation of the trailer made in that post is indeed simply false. Especially since they had stated they began drafting it last year...
---
If that post ends up being right, it's not a case of finding subtle hints to the correct destination, but rather similar to the many bandwagon theorizing about sylvari being dragon minions, it would be largely a case of hitting the bull's eye while pointing the other direction. A correct conclusion made with false support.
---
That said, from the get go I've felt the potential of the Pale Tree being involved due to her nature as a benevolent dragon champion, and I do not think Logan is pointing to the location of the new map.
---
Thats fine but on non weekend days you have people like me that try to fit raid pugs, crafting, pvp and general fooling around into a 2-3h timeslot. Having a day off to just enjoy the game for once without time issues is always nice to have. Add to that that personally, 80% of my vacation days simply get deleted since i dont manage to take them in a good manner.
---
Then do it at certain times
---
He's the god of war. Why read words when you can just kill stuff the words tell you stuff about?

Then your CPU should be your first upgrade. Wait for the Ryzen 3 announcements at Computex before you do anything.
---
Just a heads up, you should be trying to get on the map at the very start of the blighting towers event or preferably right at the end of the last mordremoth timer. That’s when the organized map fills and it fills quickly. If there’s nothing on lfg just port in during this ten minute window and your odds of getting thrown on an instance with commanders gathering are pretty high.
---
How come when I watch you tube videos of people swarming around in zergs it is super smooth? Do they have godlike super computers or something?

I guess ryzen would mean a new motherboard too?

On NA it's hard to find any DS maps from 12 AM to 6 AM PST. On NA people are mostly asleep at this time and the folks who are awake for the night usually aren't enough for DS
---
Life is so uncertain
---
&gt; What ARE those giant vases, anyway? Why do they have purple crystals in them? I think the only theory I've actually heard about them was that they're uh, old fashioned Searing Cauldrons or something? Who built the temple on the cliff? Seers? There seems to be a Scrying Pool on the floor, but like, we don't even know if Scrying Pools are Seer tech, really.
---
&gt; 
---
Regarding that, it's a Vabbian-styled palace guarded by a djinn. It's not too far from the furthest reach of the Primeval Kings, Elonians are long known to bind djinn to guard treasure vaults and palaces, and those vases are similarly used in other djinn-buildings iirc.
---
So the answer of who built them is likely the Primeval Kings at the height of their dominion.
---
As for why they have crystals - that's harder to say, but they're probably normal amethyst crystals being grown inside. Seems legit if an earth djinn was involved. Don't recall any scrying pool though, I'd have to look again for that.
---
Not true. The HPs require event.
---
It's reddit. Simple questions NEVER get upvotes. And why should they? They're not frontpage worthy and yet they always get answered anyways.

The Commander goes 900 years into the future and everyone vows to never mention them again.

I'm hoping they release the full version on Soundcloud or something in the future like they did with 'Fear Not This Night(Reprise).'
---
Yes. Any new CPU will require a new motherboard and RAM for you.
---
I doubt it. Its something they would advertise. I'd like it but lets keep our expectations in check.
---
Are you a punny person or do you want a real asura name?
---
Not everyone can physically be online at the peak times which is unfortunate . For instance I can't usually be online during peak hours. A lot of metas literally just fail in NA night time, even tried getting good ips and it always throws me into the same ones with 4 people standing around hoping more will come. There are rare occasions at this window of time where the event actually succeeds, but after 12 AM PST, it's hard to find anything .
---
It’s hard to let it go
---
I have a Scourge named Thanatologist Mykk.
---
I figure death is just another thing to be studied.
---
It wouldn't be out of the ordinary for them to include an instanced map. Not the first time they'd do it.
---
Besides "a FoW" map exists and has existed for ages, found by that\_shaman and Wooden Potatoes years ago; they made a big hubdub over it just to turn out it was a random QA dev testing tools and remaking FoW in their free time (they got promoted out of QA for that map too). But ArenaNet could go back to pull that map if it still exists in their client dat and use it if they so desire.
---
Would be a cool and cheap way to add a big map.
---
Thanks Angels! :D
---
I also love this map and i don't get lost there, kinda always know where i am.
---
Well i rather fight beside you :)
---
Yeah your answer seems right. Hard topic to fix tbh
---
i would rather have a real name
---
What if kralk is the last boss of w7?
---
What I was thinking of lol
---
Can you imagine the outrage t.t
---
What lore ? You agree with him just based on his name ? Really ? 
---
Im not saying that he is wrong or right. Im jsut saying that there are other possibilities as well. The map could be just reused old prop wich doesnt mean anything. The map can be in The Mists or doesnt need to be. 3 or 4 years we had confirmation that Anet are not working on another legendary GS because we already have 3 of them and here you go we have another one. So the comment on forum half year back that Living story maps will not be in the Mist doesnt have a big weight. We even have current events in The Mists now. Maybe we will get a new The Grove where half will be a Mist Rift and thats how we will get SkyScales I have no clue. Maybe we are both right or maybe we are both wrong I dont know. 
---
Fact that they made a map few years ago and used it now to make Logan point right in the middle exactly on this new map. Maybe you are strong beliver but this feels extremly lucky. But again we knew about Caudecus private room under CM dungeon from the beta and it came out 3 years later ? Everything can be possible but I will not have my hopes up just to be dissapointed later
---
Doesnt always have to be the case.
---
I had a rare around 23 silver, thought about selling it. Then i salvaged it and i got 3 ectos from it. Guess its pure luck but i think the best rare to sell would be above 50 silver
---
That is frighteningly accurate.
---
Are you on NA ? IF so , you might try finding a foreign , yet still English speaking guild for night time play. For instance , one of my 2 main guild is a SEA guild  , they're mostly from Singapore , with a dollop of Russians. Really great group. And they are most active at NA night time.
---
Funnily enough the pale tree was a champion who lost her master too.
---
It's an item you can redeem at any time on any character.
---
It's a consumable item, and you'll get two of those, one for each expansion.
---
It's a conumable item, you can use it or just level up the way you want.
---
&gt;However with necro it's more of a community issue than a balance issue
---
Big point to help with this is that previously over the years, dps builds in PvE had some kind of support in them, whereas Necro was extremely greedy. But as of lately, that support has been getting nerfed, so that "greedy build" aspect is more widespread now.
---
If he would purely do it for money, he would not have stopped streaming on Twitch.

It is the Kralkatorrik’s imminent threat that made human queen Jenna and charr to sign a treaty, once the dragon dead, we can’t be sure that if the charrs and human will the battle again.

Ah thats great news thank you very much!

Imagine you, the commander is on your knees and then suddenly, you hear Trahearne's voice saying "Commander, on your left."

As they say, "Lineage Remaster service". Also if you look a few years back, Lineage had huge drops from the launch of Lineage M (port of Lineage to Mobile) that players went to (much of the size of the Mobile Game market share is due to Lineage M).

It indicates that it is possible that Aurene fate is connected with The Pale Tree and The Dream. What’s more, remember that

You are of course free to feel angry about whatever you want. That doesn't make it less weird.
---
Aurora is the End of the season legendary(I’ve heard about aurora but don’t know it come as a season ending legen)? Sorry I just started to play the game in late 2017. How many end season legendaries so far in game? Are they all accessories or back-pieces?
---
If you like paperthin tank go for Elementalist since its one of the best DDs out there, prepare to die a lot and also get used to bleeding fingertips from combobreaking your keyboard. You might want to try Mesmer too because its argueably less cancer and much safer to play than Weaver.. and they're also using Swords while being a Mage. Plus they're on/off brainded OP in PvP, devs simply can't balance that toolkit.
---
Warrior uses Greatsword more as a toolkit Weapon than a real dps choice, its less a DD and more an offensive Supporter in Endgame content part because he lacks burst and also because his Team utility is better than his damage. If you want to play with Greatsword as a main Weapon and also want to press your Ass into heavy Plates you're better of picking Guardian (they're also part of the Meta).
---
I'm assuming that's a female asura, so using my knowledge of Greek goddesses and my rudimentary asura knowledge:
---
Styx: Styxxa, Styxxi
---
Lethe: Lethii
---
Hecate: Hexxa
---
Erinyes (Furies): Rinii, Vantha
---
Moirai (Fates):Moirii
---
Erebus: Erebii, Ereba
---
Good luck :)
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I hoping she will stay dead. The Joko thing seems to obvious, do unsure if that will happen. Maybe caithe finds a way to sacrifice herself so her life force is used for aurene.
---
Or maybe they could do a proper all avatar based thing where aurene is taken to the pale tree, all the sylvari sit but naked, glow, chant and sway  and the pale tree revives Aurene lol.
---
Badly worded. I meant the pale tree and the commander were both champions.

---
The only two good alternative to druid are tempest and herald, boons for 10 (might/fury/prot/regen/speed). In my mind, Tempest is a better option than druid in most of the case.
---
But this is only if you play solo heal. For a 2nd healer, everything is best than a 2nd druid (I think).
---
On some case, you can replace druid by a renegade heal but you have to play in pair with a Quickbrand or adapt your squad compo for that.
---
This has been part of the speculation since the last episode dropped.
---
That would actually be far more original and believable than any of their writing the last 2 years. I vote yes.

Sounds like you're not utilising your shade skills. Every skill besides Manifest Shade has the ability to apply Burning with Dhuumfire and some have rather short cooldowns.
---
I think you're on to something. My personal theory is that the next episode is going to take place [here](https://i.imgur.com/6hGqNje.jpg).
---
* It's in the Maguuma jungle.
---
* It's close to where 3 other elder dragons have been met. That might have something to do with The Grove. 
---
* The skyscale trailer showed lots of tall cliffs against the sea.
---
* That trailer also showed a scene on a wide, shallow river with large trees shadowing the area. The map looks like there's a bunch of rivers there between some islands of land (maybe cliffs?).
---
all is vain

Originality...people lack it.

I always find it amusing when someone thinks they discovered some genius theory when others have been already talking about it for months.
---
more like hours
---
I hade the same speculation till the death of Aurene. But when you listen to the devs, they seems to let Aurene be dead
---
Just do this because it is the only way I will get legendary armor, eventually.  The semi-afk part is because I will not run and "help the server" as then I get told what class I need to be playing and how to play it.
---
Should take ingame photos next to an Asuran Golem somewhere in the world that would match &gt;.&gt;
---
If we ever go there in GW2, it'll probably be in a story instance or a raid.
---
I doubt we'll get open world maps in the mists other than the WvW ones.
---
This was me a few weeks ago.  SO MANY BOOSTERS!
---
Whenever at a meta I drop a portal in front of an area and then place it in narnia. The look of people that take the portal thinking someone portalled them ahead only to get lost wondering where they are makes me laugh every time
---
You win
---
One thing you may be missing is that, due to level scaling mechanics, level 30 armor really isn't *any* better than your starting armor was... and may in fact be worse depending on the rarity.
---
Some things to note:
---
*Elementalist is bar none the squishiest class in the game, so things are gonna hurt no matter what
---
* Speccing into water alone will get you almost no advantages. Healing skills, as a whole, are *very* weak unless you're decked out with full Healing Power gear, including trinkets and runes.
---
* Elementalist healing is very strong, *but*, it requires a lot of level 80 gear and the Tempest traitline to truly shine.
---
* At your current level, if you're running healing traits with damage gear, you'll do medium damage and low healing, dying fast. If you run healing gear and traits, you'll have basically no damage and only moderate healing. Either way is suffering.
---
* Good news, though: you can change your traits any time and there's more than enough points to unlock everything, so the worst you've done is slow yourself down for a few levels.
---
The general way you want to play in early game is to focus on raw damage in order to kill your enemy before they kill you. Outlasting an enemy is a fool's errand with how healing scaling and cooldowns work early in the game. If you need to survive, focus on damage mitigation. Arcane Shield blocks some attacks, Glyph of Storms cast in Earth created a pulsing blind field that can negate a large number of attacks before it ends. Also look at projectile destruction such as Swirling Winds when faced with ranged attackers. Blocks and blinds are your friends, along with judicious dodging (In reference to another comment: most enemies in the base game *do not* have clear ground telegraphs for their powerful attacks, and only a few types of attacks get circles at all, so it's not a reliable way to know what to dodge. You'll have to learn animations of particularly troublesome moves, unfortunately).
---
That doesn't sound very accurate/ nuanced.
---
You can roam. You can do small scale. You can find comms that suit your play style. You can also go pvp and do whatever. Or you can do raids and get the armor much, much faster.
---
There is no requirement to adjust your play style unless you insist on joining certain groups. 
---
But you choose not to play the game, atleast actively, over any of these options just to hopefully get legendary armor one day. You'd rather semi afk than play the game. Why is that? 
---
To me it feels like finding appropriate groups, learning how to raid, finding a "meta" spec you enjoy, learning how to scout or roam, ... are all reasonable options. But I get the impression all of these are "too much effort" for many players. Which is weird because those players will semi afk for several hundred hours avoiding gameplay religiously just to get ... statswap armor without the skins. Do not not comprehend.
---
"I can contain the power!"
---
Ah thats neat ;)
---
Tbh if that were the case they would have done so sooner and not 6 years later. I'd sooner wager it's the micro transactions from people who are playing from before.
---
Not that it's doing anything wrong, I believe this game has merit on it's own and I'm always surprised how people don't see it. Guess it takes the popular MMOs crashing to make people consider other possibilities (sure as hell what it took my friends to consider GW2 despite me vouching it for years &gt;.&gt;)
---
No, I'm not sure where you got that information from.
---
I commute 4 hours every day. I love how long his videos are. He never skips any details and his voice doesn't bug me.
---
The real answer: Make rune of the stars and dump to the 3 gold buy orders right now.  Or at least as long as they last.  
---
2.55 gold revenue after TP tax.  Ectos, symbols and other stuff costs 1.29 gold right now, so net profit of about 1.25 gold per 15 kralkatite, or 8 silver each.  Get it while it's hot.  See also - sigil of the stars, but that one needs 50 kralkatite, so not as good.
---
My bet is on the commander shaving their eyebrows and going super saijin 3.
---
Playing at 4K would put most of the load onto the gpu. A cpu Of today’s standards would have probably given him a few more frames, but 4K definitely depends on mostly gpu.
---
Have you already posted this to /r/GuildWarsDyeJob?
---
Well they could do everything with mounts skins so, maybe we will get a wyvern skin
---
No i hav'nt, you can share it if you like:)
---
obviously *fluff*
---
For some reason it shows $40 for me the bundle instead of $25. Weird.
---
No the Min/max hover you can have is based from the ground under you. They showed it in the livestream. Dev was up and when he went over bigger hole he immediately started to go down sadly. 
---
You can climb up but with breaks between so you can recharge your stamina. You can use your skill to recharge your stamina once but then the CD will stop. Even when you are on the wall. The only way how to get more up is to land on a ledge and rest for a while. But I bet people will firstly use Griff to get up, jump from their Griff and then remount on their SkyScale. Oh those possibilities how to break them map &lt;3
---
Take the upvote and get the hell out of here.
---
The music is so beutiful that it made me cry and i get the chill each time i watch the trailer. I would guess it is Maclaine. If i remember right when he said a while back that he will freelance that he just finnished up the last episode or something the like.
---
use gw2efficiency to search your account for it

i think you're better off watching the old stream

---
1 titan would have been more than enough for one 4k monitor and no gpu from 1080 upwards would have been the bottleneck really. Specially when his cpu is at 3.7 GHz
---
Hahaha I'm dumb but they give you one of those game keys per the entire bundle I just bought it myself
---
It's one of my favorite weapons in the game. Ranger greatsword has 2 evades, a block, a stun, a ranged cripple (to chase people down), a dash, and a short cooldown burst. It's flippin' loaded with goodies.
---
Would be probably harder then you think. Drake or Griff both have wings on their backs. That means their model is diferent then Wyvern. They would need to make a new model and animation based on movement and flight.
---
I don't want Aurene to return. Now don't get me wrong I want her in the next episode with her mother and brother but bringing her back seems icky to me I'm sorry. I kind of want us to kill Kralky and magic gets messed up or the Gods return and they take the magic but bringing back Aurene so soon is a cop out. Listening to the trailer I think whoever is saying the poem will have something to do and I don't think its Zhafirah.
---
Earth's [moas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa) look nothing like Tyria's moas.
---
Tyria's moas look more like [Terrorbirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phorusrhacidae).
---
My point was that the game itself is the “bottleneck” so to speak. Even with a cpu at 5ghz, he probably only would’ve gotten a few more frames. If he turned certain frame killing setting down, he would’ve been able to achieve some really nice numbers, even with the 3.7ghz cpu.
---
No because we didn't think Anet were going to kill the bloody one person we would need. After episode 4 maybe when the visions happened but even then I think the community thought the visions were to make us think she would die so Anet could surprise us in episode 5.
---
It is done every time it is up you simply need to understand how meta event works and how to find the people. Always use the lfg-tool as your first choice. Check when next event is comming up because they are all on a schedual, then open the lfg-tool and the Dragon Stand map. If there is one join the comander and move to the map. If there is none move to the map about 15 min before it close and look for a tag and join the tag and then you will very likely be ported with the tag to the same map. Sometimes this do not happen so then you right click the tag name and join his/her instance. You need to be fast on the latter or it will be full soon enough.
---
If none of this works wait for the next one or set up your own squad and add to lfg-tool and so on. http://dulfy.net/2015/11/09/gw2-hot-maps-timer-famme/ This simple timer will tell you exactly were the event is in time and when it will start a new one.

All of the above
---
I didn't know it was a meme. Always just seemed like a universally accepted fact.
---
And all im saying is that having overkill GPU wont make fix the games performance that is tied to CPU heavy stuff. So when people say "i get only 30 FPS in LA with 2080ti" when they have player models on max it is annoying to me cause the think GPU is only thing you need for good performance
---
As much as I love GW2, they've always had completely and utter shit trailers compared to other games. Luckily, they've been getting a lot better for a while now. This one is so simplistic but I feel like it really captures where we left off in Ep 5 while giving us a feel for what's coming in Ep 6.
---
It's certainly Maclaine's composition, but he is a guitarist, not pianist. He invited a lot of talented musicians before, so I wonder if he invited someone to play piano part for the trailer.
---
wow that's impressive

Let me just add that asuran names often contain a repeated consonant and female name follow the same conventions.

So Glokk(a), Brrap(a), Dupp(a), Zipp(a), Gzzik(a) and so on.

It's hard to tell with asura sometimes, but your character seems to be female? Allow me to suggest Senior Necrologist Gapp(a).

Did you create the new Free account on the same email address or a different one?  That might be causing issues.

there are people that still don't have all gen 1 legendaries??

Weird. I did it this way: I added the base Path of Fire to the basket which is $15. And at the next page a banner appeared saying that I can add the Heart of Thorns dlc for $10 more. Both of the dlc are standard editions.
---
No I used a different one.
---
I still think Aurene will come back as some undead dragon type thing after consuming Joko.
---
stranger things c418 remix
---
 hummingbird and skimer have the same "body". They still have a big body, two wings and tail. Drakes like this SkyScale or how its called or our Griff have 2 front , 2 back legs and wings from their backs. Wyvern have only 2 back legs and arms wich are also their wings. While flaying it would be the same yes but on the ground it would be really diferent. On the ground Wyverns are incredibly slow. So Anet would need to change speed , animations and probably a lot more . The only thing they could do to satisfy your Wyvern idea would be a "drake" model with Wyvern features like head and scales. But even then that would be still a drake with Wyvern head =(
---
Last time this was up i had a lot of fun, this time was different. Fights was simply boring and over in 10 sec. I was bored to death half way in to that week.
---
I don't think this should be downvoted or anything because you're possibly correct.
---
One thing to really consider though is how much work it takes to create the cinematic. It's not like they can just put Logan's finger on anything at all, they do have to set it up, so if they had something in mind for the story they could have hinted at it here.
---

---
Another question, are you using the LFG AND looking for a map with plenty of time before the map starts (like 20-15 min before)?  Dragon Stand most groups that do it organize via the LFG and that causes maps to fill so if you just randomly port in after it's technically started will *usually™* dump you into a fresh map which is under populated.  
---
On the weekends you are more likely to find groups doing it even late night.  Another tip is it's pretty easy to get one going on your own (i've done this, had a successful map clear it at like 4am central time on the weekend).  Just go to the map 20 mins prior to the map reset and open an LFG with "DS meta taxi".  Getting people into the map is all it really takes.  If you are still low on folks for each lane when it starts just have each lane throw up an LFG and slowly gain people as the meta progresses.  Usually by the time you get to the three main bosses you'll have big enough squads.  
---
Good luck out there o7

XD I disagree with him a fair bit usually, but you don't need to make it like, you're being personally attacked. You're not.
---
On the like, off-hand comment about there never being an open world in The Mists, I actually share your scepticism. From what I've seen on this topic, the barrier for a Mists map isn't a lore one, it's a technology problem and a design issue -- the World Map system is some sort of arcane programming relic from the early development days that's kind of hard to change. I'd think it'd be pretty easy to just like, have some arbitrary point of the Unending Ocean work as a 'game location' for the map and hide the rest, I am pretty sure that's what happens with certain story instances. 
---
The design problem is a bit more meaty, though -- how would having a Mists open world map work exactly? Can you waypoint in and out at will? Do you need to go to a physical location and use a portal? These aren't insurmountable issues at all but still need to be dealt with.
---
I think it'd be far more likely to instead bring The Mists to Tyria, like with the current events, Jahai, and Nightfall - Have say, a chunk of the Fissure of Woe, physically placed upon Tyria via rifts, and reality freaking out cause of the dragon eating it. Regions that are canonically still in the Mists, it's perfectly still fine to see them via story instances and raids - but like, lorewise, it doesn't seem like too much of a reach to say we can have a 'Mists map' that's still firmly located within Tyria - I am assuming that's what we're getting on Tuesday tbh.
---
We also noticed a lot of Elonian flora in the teasers, which is why people are gravitating toward the speculation of it being near the Scavenger's Causeway, right at the crux between the Tarnished Coast (technically Maguuma) and the Crystal Desert.
---
Though I'd be really interested to see the area you highlighted, too.
---
Most of the cc was down to the renegade and warrior. Renegade with Darkrazor's Daring and staff 5 plus warrior maces and rampage if needed was more than enough. There was probably some other stuff used aswell but from my point of view I only used stuff like shield 5 when it lined up, I didn't go out of my way to save skills.
---
Wow, that's quality trailer.
---
It’s almost not worth “upgrading” anything unless you’re willing to do a whole system overhaul. Your motherboard decides what of upgrades you can do. I mean you can’t put in a modern processor or upgrade to DDR4. At best you can get a 2700k an SSD (if you don’t already have one) and slightly faster ram. 
---
Changing everything you’ll get access to DDR4 for one thing and newer hexacore intel CPUs
---
Branded storms for skimmer aswell

It's her nose. The mouth is the bit with the fang in it.

This is the kind of counterplay I've been looking for.

If that is true then maybe we will see finally Menzies (doesn't matter if dead or alive)?
---
I tried but still nothing. I did use a third email and signed up on Mobile and that worked for some reason.

I mean, it IS Team 3. But I'm cautiously optimistic.

#When animu censors the nice bits with streaks of light or black bars but yu take advantage of this fact to commit crimes naked.

When a game us bought by NCsoft and becomes f2p, there's Always a danger.
---
But the game is doing well, the devs do a wonderful job by playing with the community and there's a lot of events the whole Time.
---
I Hope it continues this way.
---
Bares are naked. This is a pun.
---
Go to Ember Bay at the heart quest where you fix scientific data recorders or in Iron Marches at the heart where you canon the wall and you see tons of these.
---
On the other hand, this is the most wholesome conversation a PvP match has ever seen.
---
The average level of ranked pvp is mediocre by the definition of the word. 
---
Average players tend to feel like some bunkers are too strong because they are too passive in their defensive rotations which make them easier to play at a high level of efficiency and hence harder for imperfect players to counter. 
---
Largely because when trying to kill someone, it is much easier to waste skills by missing a window of opportunity than it is to waste a skill in a continuous defensive rotation. 
---
So have some pity for the average person instead of shitting on them for no reason.
---
I second this, a core account is always better than an F2P account, you dont have the annoying restrictions and those sweet sweet birthday gifts :P
---
I’m not sure, I’d recommend digging around on [Metabattle](www.metabattle.com) to see what core builds have high ranks.

2 and 4 actually makes good sense.

For open world pve stuff (including the storyline), reaper tends to be better as fights against a single target tend to be shorter (which favours power based damage) and reaper supports power builds better then scourge.

So you spend your entire game time in LA?

uhh ff14 trailers are “good animations”.

Thanks everyone!

Won, just take 3 zeros off. It is a little less than that(-12%), but it is close enough.

Here is my theory.

Logan (pointing at the dominion of the wind) : 
---
"We need Tengus to be playable, now... it's time Rytlock. It's time."
---
He wears grenth's outfit on every character
---
I really hope we go full suicide mission to kill kralk. Rush head long and get vaporized.... all is lost we failed tyria. We basically get sent into the mists. There the next living world will take place. We have to defeat kralk in the mists to protect tyria from being overloaded with magic. At the end of it all aurne uses joko magic to bring us all back to tyria. But shit has hit the fan while we have been gone... Bubbles has taken over all of cantha.
---
Definitely recover the old one.
---
Even if you can't find your old serial number, still submit as much information as you can when recovering your old account.
---
You should receive an auto-email confirming they got your request, then it might take a day or two but support will work with you to establish ownership.
---
LOL This is their quarterly revenue not operating costs.
---
Recover your account. 
---
Don’t forget: When you get your birthday rewards, always unlock the expensive dyes like permafrost and shadow abyss!!!
---
Look in the wiki for the dye rewards to specifically see which you should choose.
---
Well Anet have said season 5 won't have a new map every episode so I don't see how season 5 can take place completely in the mists. I like the suicide mission idea but I want in more terms of we are fucked and we kill Kralky and magic goes mad (with some character deaths).
---
Oh, they separate?
---
I thought that the lower the operation costs, the larger the revenue.
---
See, that could probably work. Thing is: In the Guild Wars universe, death ISN'T the end at all. Hell, I don't think it even shares the like, real world definition of "your body stops doing stuff, your mind ceases, and you never come back".
---
I think in um, Tyrian terms, Dying is defined more like "your Soul becomes split from your Body and reappears in the Mists," and Dead is essentially "A Body without a Soul." 
---
This isn't a dealbreaker, really. In GW1, Resurrection Shrines would basically just automatically bring your soul back to your body like nothing even happened (other than having to start on the Survivor title again). But sometimes that didn't happen, either, and people proper died -- but their Souls can be essentially immortal in the afterlife. 
---
*\[most of this isn't directly relevant but kind of elaborates on the mechanics, skip to next italics if you don't care\]*
---
Back when the Gods still gave a shit, there was kind of a process for this. The newly dead would arrive in The Underworld -- essentially the uh...administrative division of the afterlife. Spirits would be judged by Grenth for their lives, and if they were particularly devoted to one God, they might end up spending their post-death lives in their Realm. 
---
We don't have enough good information on this, but the most prolific God to claim souls who followed him, was Balthazar and his Eternal army. (The Book of Balthazar seems to reflect this, actually.) Grenth also kept certain spirits in the Underworld, or they simply chose not to leave -- often spirits with lingering regrets who needed closure to move on. And, if a spirit was judged to be tainted by Abaddon, they'd be quarantined in the Realm of Torment so they didn't corrupt anyone else. 
---
(What happens to the other souls that didn't get scooped up by a deity is also interesting, but kind of out of scope here.)
---
Since Grenth left, the Underworld isn't nearly as functional. Since Kralk arrived, it's downright anarchy. Spirits kinda just...fall out of the Mists back into Tyria for no reason. This could happen if a soul had a strong emotion tying them to a place already, but now it's just kinda happening randomly. These ghosts aren't like...particularly mobile, they can't just pick up their lives where they left off, because being a loose soul kinda fucks with them -- maybe they don't realise they died, maybe they can't leave where they died, or maybe they just lose their minds. Shiro Tagachi was pretty much the only functional loose soul, but even he wanted to bring himself back to life.
---
*\[lore wank ends here\]*
---
So, Aurene probably could ALREADY come back as a ghost, but it wouldn't be particularly useful. If "Dead" is a body without a soul, then "Life" must be defined as "A Soul in a Body." This is kind of the crux of the matter - putting a soul back in their body requires some way to fetch the soul. 
---
"Joko magic" as it is now known, is just basic bitch Ritualism -- Joko calls a Soul from the Mists with magic, and uses a Binding Ritual to put them in a Vessel (which could be their old Body, or it could be a body with a dog's head stitched onto it, or it could be whatever an Awakened Abomination is. It could be put into a Soul Stone and put in armour like the Exalted, Forged and some Golems. A vessel is a vessel.) That's not some rare gift, that's just the oldest style of magic in the world being used unethically. 
---
What Joko did for his own reanimation (this is a theory, but I don't want to chase down my supporting evidence tbh) was essentially...enchant his Body with a contingency plan, so that if his Soul went to The Mists, it'd be pulled straight back. It's not an /innate feature/ of the magic in him that his Soul just sticks to reality like shit on shoes. He's USED that magic to plan ahead by attaching some sort of arcane bungee cord to his Soul so it knows the way back to its Body. He got full killed, because Aurene totally consumed the Vessel, the Magic, and possibly his Soul.
---
Has Aurene done this ritual? Doubt it. She'd be back by now if she had. Did she have the capability to? Probably, if she got taught the ritual -- she's basically a jacked up magical battery at this stage. Will she come back of her own accord because Joko? Hell no, what an absolute cop-out. Someone who's still alive will need to bring her back. 
---
Maybe that something WILL be related to ritualism and Awakening. Sure. But saying "Don't worry guys, Joko Magic will bring her back from the dead" is like saying "Nobody worry, the pilot had a heart attack so we've got his mug of coffee to fly the plane." Magic is an enabler, but it doesn't really do anything purposeful in of itself without a Mind wielding it.
---
This has been my TEDTalk on why every time I hear about Joko Magic I want to put my head through a wall. Thanks for watching, like and subscribe
---
so what armor is it?
---
What if Bubbles goes full sicko mode and kills every living elder dragon after gaining Kralky’s powers, thus ending the world and ending the whole franchise in a massive 4th-wall-breaking moment where he somehow communicates with the player after taking over everything.
---
Honestly, that whole sentence now sounds quite dumb and I don’t blame anyone else for thinking it’s dumb. (Gimme a break, it’s 2am)
---
Punny names are the best. My asura necro is called "Smallsize LargeEvil" hence my reddit name lmao.
---
I can easily solo towers on my Scrapper build and I am fairly certain I could solo a keep (Air, Hills, Fire, Bay, Garri) but I have not had the opportunity to do the lords room by myself.  I have done it with 1 other player 2 times and that was pretty easy, I did have to heal the other player from downstate a couple times but I was never in any danger of going down.  
---
I do think it would take me a fair amount of time to kill the keep lord as the other player was higher damage and would think someone from the other server would get there in time to stop me unless they was really no one on from their side.
---
I am not counting the Earth keep on RedBL as I have soloed that on a Ranger several times and 1 time with the Scrapper.  Ranger is super easy to solo cap Earth as you just use the outer ring barrier that comes up to just pew pew at the lord and duck behind it when it does its projectile weapon at you.
---
Shit really? Maybe i should go try this.
---
Carapace Mask (Head), Rawhide Shoulders (Shoulders), Triumphant Hero's Brigandine (Chest), Prowler Gloves (Hands), Stalwart Leggings (Legs), Guild Watchman Boots (Feet) and Peacemaker's Pistol (Weapon).
---
Scheduling works for Steve Blum I guess
---
Aion is dead, Lineage 2 is dead (in the west), B&amp;S will be dead in a year, NCsoft is failing so hard in MMOs right now, the huge focus on mobile it shows.
---
Am I missing previous scenes, or does this explicitly show voice lines that will feature in the next episode?
---
"Whatever time we have left, it's a gift" - Standing in what looks like the branded room in the battle with Kalk
---
"Remember, this is for Aurene."
---
"Working on getting you stronger weapons, can't help with Gwen though" - Refrencing gwen, the GW1 character that appeared in the last episode as a ghost?
---
you mean those things were knives all along!? mindblown
---
Possible **spoilers** in this video, just FYI.
---
This is actually so well done, nice!
---
Warning, possible **spoilers** in the included video.
---
My point is it doesn't really solve the problem here if it still omits some skins. Moreover, the wiki straight up doesn't have pics for many skins.
---
Definitely new dialogue.  Surprised how much they are giving away with this video.
---
I DESERVE THIS.
---
Given the rest of the season my expectation is one or more major story characters will get killed.  Bubbles would be a welcome change of pace.
---
L❤️L - K!
---
&gt; Gwen
---
Yeah, I'm convinced we'll be fighting alongside Glint's spirit army in the upcoming episode. Wouldn't be remotely surprised to see Gwen play a big role.
---
Yeah, I agree. I just always find it a bit suprising how little GW2 makes compared to other games despite its popularity. I am surprised they haven't monetised the game more than they have.
---
 It seems a bit odd from a business point of view to have the playerbase and not monetise it as much as your competitors. I mean I am not complaining, it is a good deal for me the customer. I have spent around $120 ish for the base game, and both expansions, and got thousands of hours of playtime out of it.
---
This is a pretty dramatic change from the previous VA. It'll probably be a bit of a shock for a lot of people. However, this sounds promising to me. I'm looking forward to hearing more with the release.
---
That's exactly why i like.his vids. He talks like a normsl.person instesd of screaming. His gw1 lets play is great

There are a few scenes from the episode 6 in the video!

You don't replace Spike Spiegel. You just don't.
---
Did they also get rid of Eve? Who's the fat white guy?
---
I think the "too much action" direction was more in reference to how animated she was in the booth, moving her body around, rather than how her voice sounded.  I would imagine that movement could throw off the recording.
---
I am still gutted that he left Anet. His music really helped me enjoy post launch gw2.
---
You stole my words 😅
---
Shut up, baby! I know it!
---
Well now these news made me even more excited for this Tuesday, can’t wait!
---
Dungeons have some foes which hit hard (particularly Elite foes, and probably the Legendary spider/kholer if you're talking about Ascalonian Catacombs). I wouldn't worry too much about dying if you're at the same level as them, it's just part of the learning process, you'll get a bit wiser at avoiding damage as you play through other areas.
---
I really hope /u/plagueofgripes has loosely kept up with GW2
---
ANet on the phone with Felicia Day: *"Just an hour of your time, PLEASE."*
---
That would honestly be incredible. Not only with Destiny's Edge, but maybe even more callback characters from GW1 (Pyre, Vekk, Jora, etc), plus Glint herself back in action, Vlast, who knows?
---
And that's not even counting the fact that I strongly believe we'll interact with the gods before the end, too.
---
Naming a character is so difficult it's the real endgame.
---
It is a pretty simple piece though, there is every chance that they just played it themselves.

When I watch your videos, I always get this tingly feeling of wanting to do some reaping.   
---
I don't do well, but man you always inspire me to at least try.
---
I think people with a 2700x are getting some good fps, not 8600k but nor does it lag behind.
---
I'm fairly certain we're going to fight the remaining Elder Dragons eventually, but I personally hope the next season focuses on some B-plot stuff to reduce the narrative tension. There are a bunch of loose threads that could be pursued: Taimi's illness, finding replacements for the other Elder Dragons, or something Norn/Charr-related could be strong contenders.
---
I hope I'm wrong and wouldn't mind if I was. I think think they were super careful about the verbage here and they were very specific on how to get the roller beetle via story. They weren't so much on this one simply calling it via masteries.
---
I think you meant Diversion (or was it Cry of Frustration)?
---
&gt; And that's not even counting the fact that I strongly believe we'll interact with the gods before the end, too.
---
Hopefully we'll get to hit them with something. I strongly feel like at least one of the Six deserves to be hit with something as a reward for their *extremely poor* choices. Except Melandru. She's okay.
---
You leave mommy Dwayna out of this.
---
How about the Gwen line near the beginning? I know she already made an appearance in episode 5, so wondering how much of a role she'll have here
---
I like the idea of Gwen possibly being in this remember the trailer "this is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning" who was the first voice we heard in this franchise Gwen. I'm not saying it mean GW is done after this episode but the line makes it sound like things in Tyria are about to change.
---
Scuba Steve
---
It would likely be very expensive, but I wonder if they'll have this new VA go back and re-record all the old Female Charr Player dialogue for consistency's sake. I mean, I would.
---
Maybe that's why I don't have a game studio. Or maybe it's not why; I dunno.
---
Hmm you will have to become a GMO :P
---
July 1st, 2019: ArenaNet announces the development of Guild Wars 3, set 900 years after the events of Guild Wars 2.
---
I think Eve is more like a producer or "[VO wrangler](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bmjkgd/youtube_guild_wars_2_living_world_season_4/emxnylp/?context=1000)" according to this dev.  That guy seemed to be a director.
---
"Life Is Short"
---
"Good" fps is not the issue here. OP wants to upgrade his PC, and he's asking for suggestions specifically for CPU. It would be dishonest to suggest an AMD CPU for GW2. **At the same price points, Intel CPUs will beat AMD CPUs in GW2 every single time.** GW2 simply can't take advantage of the mult-thread performance that Ryzen offers.   
---
I'm not saying that AMD CPUs are bad overall, but if GW2 is the main concern, Ryzen would be a poor investment.  
---
Also to add, an Intel CPU would be able to take advantage of the d912pxy mod much better than an AMD.
---
which might imply we are going to the Domain of the Lost. Possiblay finding spirits  that cannot pass ...rules of death don't apply? who knows? Aurene / Glint spirit army?
---
One of my Guild mates suggested "Professor" for my Asuran Necro and it's worked well. My Ranger is Pippi because of that one hairstyle and my Guardian is a Wrathologist because if you've got holy fire why not get a degree with wrath?
---
It's also worth noting that charr and norn usually have post-processing effects placed on their voice, so we'll have to see how it sounds with those too
---
The most i have seen people "master" is 2 or 3 classes, with build variations on each one. That doesn't mean you don't know what other classes can do and when they should do it, after all being competive is not only be a master of your build but also know what other people can do with theirs.
---
It would be especially interesting because Ashe is voiced by Queen Jennah herself - Jenifer Hale
---
There was a comic with a similar idea a few weeks ago
---
Im aware, queen Jen...ifer
---
idk why i laughed so hard at the "death jail" lmaoooooo
---
If what you are after is to raise your luck then better forget it, you will be swimming in luck more sooner than later.
---
I think the trailer is set where the last episode left off -- right after Aurene's death in the now-branded Auditorium of Thunderhead Peaks.
---
wouldn't be her first time
---
Sounds pretty fine to me! She's very into the role from the looks of it which is always a plus
---
"Precursor weapons can be acquired through dumb luck that gets better with higher magic find, throwing gear in the Mystic Forge, crafting them, or buying them from the Trading Post. By crafting them it will usually cost the most, but you’ll also gain a series of achievement points."
---
Would you recommend rewording it to be "collection achievement" instead of "crafting"?
---
that's what I mean. He went on self-lockdown.
---
and also it was a pun on blishlock
---
Hi, my old PC died shortly after completing HoF and I've only recently got something usable for GW2 again. From memory, after HoF released it became a bundle with the base game rather than an expansion.
---
The current 50% off for PoF is very tempting, unless War Eternal is going to be similar and I'd be better waiting for that to release and get the pair for (presumably) £25, rather than £13 now for PoF and £25 later for WE. Did that happen when PoF came out too, in which case it can be expected again?
---
I'm not saying it can't be I'm just saying Anet will probably want the Fissure of Woe be like it was in GW1 just like they did with the underworld.
---
You mean Almorra?
---
yes, and going into more details about the process
---
Ok, thanks for the help!
---
You're thinking of Profit. Revenue = how much they brought in. Profit = revenue - costs.
---
The Pale Tree early on was probably the biggest player interested in getting everyone to fight the dragons. Wouldn't be a bad place for her to enter the picture again
---
Ahh, I had never heard of Blish lock before, so I missed the quality pun. I've been educated on this day. Thank you, and Praise the Eternal Alchemy.
---
Ah, I'd messed it up as the next expansion. Seems like that's not imminent then, cheers :)
---
That being said, I doubt you'll get a better deal than the 50% off of PoF
---
You're thinking of profit, not revenue.
---
I like your reasoning, I still think its south of Mount Maelstrom myself (especially since that_shaman posted an image of himself on a raptor in front of the south gate that doesn't lead to anything just some week or two ago).
---
But I do like your reasoning! :)
---
THIS IS MY STORY. havent you been past the character creation page?
---
I know it's not likely but I hope we get new gameplay quotes with this. The current ones are a bit meh imo and it would be odd hearing one voice while playing and another during story segments.
---
Not 'New', she said 'True'... presumably we're gonna make a Dragonsblood Spear from Aurene's blood and use that to kill Kralkatorrik
---
It makes me wonder if this is in reference to the end of Edge of Destiny novel where Caithe gathered Kralk's crystallized blood in the aftermath of the battle with Glint to use the blood for later. It was unfortunate that she didn't bring the blood with her to the Dragonsblood Forge, or at least mentioned her past with the blood to the forgemaster, in Ep5 as we could've used Kralk's actual blood to forge a true Dragonsblood Spear instead of the inferior copies we ended up using.
---
&gt; Caithe walked along the Dragonbrand—the wide swath of destruction laid down by Kralkatorrik. Every once in a while, she would bend down and pull a large green crystal from the sands.  
---
&gt; "Dragon blood," she said, staring gladly at one such stone before sliding it into her pack.  
---
&gt; It was lonely work, wandering these desolate places, searching for the secrets of Kralkatorrik and the Elder Dragons. But it was even lonelier when she traveled to Hoelbrak or Rata Sum or Divinity's Reach or the Black Citadel only to find that her onetime friends had become strangers.  
---
&gt; But they would be friends again. Someday, they would join her. Someday, they would fight the dragons again.  
---
Then again, devs stated this on the Episode 5 LP livestream when I asked if the novel's ending of Caithe collecting Kralk's blood was considered while writing the story of Ep5:
---
&gt; I dont think so--we were aware of it. I'm not sure we are tied to those books completely, but I know whatever it is that we were using was the optimal path, I imagine that that blood over time is not, that was a while ago, so I think the fresher the blood there's something to be said about that, right, is more powerful? To be used? I don't know. I'll have to get in with the narrative team.
---
If it ends up being canonical that fresh dragonsblood is better suited for forging the actual Dragonsblood Spears (and Dragonsblood Blade aka [Sanguinary Blade](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sanguinary_Blade) for Jormag) while the older, crystallized blood is left to be used to be converted to other stuff such as Snaff's ingenious [powerstones](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Powerstone) (which were used to weaken Kralk and create "portals" into his mind so Snaff could mentally wrestle with him), the line from the Junot video about the spear would then suggest we need to get a fresh sample of Kralk's blood (either from Ep5 battle, sometime during Ep6, or via Mists rift time travel shenanigans a la Requiem armor to travel to the sites of his previous battles against whomever) to forge a new spear unless Glint hid a spare somewhere...
---
Going to be interesting to find out what happens in the episode. :)
---
The document can definitely grow. I'll see what I can slap together over the weekend.
---
You in any discords with me? Your name is familiar. (Hepatitis)
---
It's fairly long, but rewarding once it's done.
---
I believe Felicia Day has confirmed that she would be willing to reprise the role of Zojja, but Anet have never asked her.
---
I think I was thinking of profit. Not revenue.
---
Great video, I love watching Holts, always great use of terrain.
---
Yeah some of her lines are difficult to listen too. The quality of her VO definitely got better over time though. They won't re-do previous story lines because that would be too much work but I hope we get new gameplay quotes since we hear them all the time. The current ones are pretty dated.
---
FLAWLESS
---
guess he never misses huh?
---
Hahaha it's all practice :))

(and these are just the good clips, the other half is uninteresting/me dying so it's not all sunshine hehe)

---
Another great community I feel is the Soulsborne community. I don’t think I’ve met so many helpful, jolly co-operators, and even nice PvPers in any game ever. GW2 ranks up there pretty close to them in my opinion as well.😄
---
Sounds more charr-y to me.
---
Yeah I loved seeing Almorra back in the story. I really want her there when Kralk bites it. I'd love to meet her daughter too.
---
This is what MMO’s should be all about, great experiences with random people ^^
---
And it’s true, GW2 community is the best ^^
---
It’s not like they’re forcing her to leave, she’s leaving for her own reasons. If you want to blame anyone for ruining the last good thing you have, blame the actress. And even then it’s extremely petty.
---
Griffon begs to differ. It is unlikely that there is another map though.
---
Oh I thought he said "accent"
---
I like it more than the old one if I'm honest. Not that the old voice actress did a bad job, but her voice was way too soft for a charr.
---
This slightly heavier slightly raspier voice fits better imo.
---
I'm curious about the "ugh! augh! eh! eurgh!" And her commentary of "just getting stabbed a bit". Unless they are re-doing combat sounds, our commander is in for some abuse.
---
For all we know Menzies could win this battle after all. Balthazar wanted to kill Elder Dragons during his war with him and after he was imprisoned and stripped of his power, Menzies could beat Balthazar's army and even became new God of War.
---
Isn't that strange that Balthazar didn't took his soldiers from Fissure of Woe if there was still war (or he already won it) or I am missing something (never played first game)?
---
ok :(
---
They commented on someone's question on Facebook that they won't be doing that.
---
I find Heart of Thorns contents too difficult to enjoy. You require a lot of people to progress through the map meta-events and nobody is here at the times I get to play in any way, as they are probably off in the desert and stuff. 
---
The enemies are very difficult and very relentless. There's a hundred of them trying to kill you at once and I fail to see how this is fair unless this is not an expansion for the casual player, which it's increasingly starting to feel like. I am on a Dragon Hunter spec and almost entirely berserker exotic, the other being berserker ascended gear. 
---
How can I get to enjoy the things I paid for?
---
Roller beetle was needed for the story?
---
Huh. I think the female norn voice is possibly the best in the game as far as matching the voice to the character. To the extent that there's a difference between that and the other female norn in the game, it's that the rest don't do it quite as well. But then the Commander is supposed to be special...
---
Necrologist Nikki! I’ve always wanted to use this name but I’ve never made a necromancer Asura.
---
&gt; They might be pulling a fast one but I really don't expect her stay dead (or at least not dead as in gone).
---
&gt; Coming back from death is not unheard of in GW. The commander did that recently and there are lots of sentient undead.
---
That would honestly be a massive aspull that would massively pull me off the story. Killing her off was the biggest climax of the entire season and a 6 month cliffhanger, they can't just go SIKE, and bring her back literally the very next episode.
---
Death needs to have some consequences otherwise everything becomes meaningless and the story loses weight.
---
Almorra is  a VETTTTTT.
---
That is awesome! That jumping puzzle is quite the challenge but I find the diving part even more so. I still haven’t completed the dive part yet myself even after trying so many times
---
You can always play the noob-slapper reaper build. Basically pve power build but in PvP.
---
Works great on people who don't know what you are doing. But anyone who actually knows what's going on will kill you pretty quick.
---
Sorry, I'm not sure what do you mean by this.
---
Well if fresh dragon blood is the key, then I'd say it's mighty convenient that a dragon was just killed.
---
Probably one of the vids from the new ad campaign.  There are links to a bunch in this thread:

That is a hairstyle I'm pretty sure.
---
No down state gives smaller groups a much better chance against blobs. It makes sense why more people prefer to keep down state.
---
Aurene’s death was a part of her ascension process. It’s why Glint was able to calm Aurene of her visions - it couldn’t end any other possible way because the only way to move forward with her power was to shed her mortal body.  She’ll be “alive”, but either in an entirely new spectral/mists way or she is “”reborn”” through some other means. 
---
Also, I’m calling that Aurene is going to turn into a sort of monotheistic godly form that inhabits all or most of the dragon energies.
---
Also appreciate the community. I'm one of those annoying people that always asks questions and people are always good sports about answering them. 
---
Haven't even hopped back into the game yet but the Reddit community itself is very welcoming.
---
*Intelligence 100.*
---
It would be poetic indeed if even in death (not counting any ghost shenanigans) Aurene would aid us in such a manner. :)
---
My thought was that Aurene transferred her consciousness into Kralk and the final episode would end with us going into Kralk's mind and helping Aurene completely take it over. That might be a little too similar to a certain other elder dragon fight though.
---
Farm achievements,  farm skins, farm gold, fuck around in LA, fuck around somewhere else, wait for the next episode, play another game while you wait for the next episode.

pj is a character, here the video [https://youtu.be/808WbiZ6IPE](https://youtu.be/808WbiZ6IPE), maybe im doing somenthing wrong.

In the equipment panel, you can dye each piece individually, with up to 4 dye channels per item.
---
In the preview panel, you can only choose 4 dyes, and each will colour its respective slot (1st, 2nd...) at every item, with no individual control over each channel.
---
(Not that it would matter for people who would only use outfits, though, since those work in exactly the same manner as the preview panel.)

We find out that something makes Almora Soulkeeper immune to branding, figure out how to use it, figure out how to use it to unbrand, then bring back Aurene.
---
I love JPs, but that one is my bane. Years ago, it took me and two other mesmers at least an hour of mutual porting up to the chest and the goggles, several times over. Just three guys randomly bonded through misery and PC death working together. That was probably the awesomest example of cooperation I've experienced in this game, ever.

Great to know there are still helpful people around!

Guild Wars 2: Invasion of Earth expansion comming soon.

---
In addition to this, I've had it come up in map chat and be completed. It does happen.
---
I like the new actress much more. I always thought the previous one sounded a little fake, and the voicelines sound much different from the dodge roll grunts and combat sounds.
---
IIRC there was a thread a while back mentioning the new god of war has already been decided/created after Balthazars boopening
---
I bet nothing happens, Kralkatorrik decides to fall asleep in The Mists somewhere, and all of Season 5 is finding out ways we can save Aurene.
---
Ask the Mirages for their Magic Bullet blenders.
---
I LOVED Kate Miller's voice-work for the female charr! So saucy and fierce.
---
There's definitely going to be a period that feels 'off'. It took a while for the male Charr to feel normal to me compared to the previous VA. Feels weird to say it, but the new Male Charr sometimes feels too empathetic, at least for a Charr.
---
Wheres this from ?
---
Scrapper is a fun time in PvP right now
---
It's not flying, it's idling in the air. When you move it starts gliding down pretty fast. Hardly reliable, mostly a tool to show off and to climb for related achievements and adventures.
---
Dont forget the BC
---
They also said the dodge / using jump key while flying , does not drain the "flight juice" allowing you to break out that canopy decline the further you go.
---
You can get the upgrade in the gem store for 1200 gems. $12.50
---
That is strange.  The only thing different between what you are doing and what I did last time I did that heart is you used action cam and never targeted the drake, where I used the normal free cam and had it targeted so that the net skill hit.
---
Definitely a bug. And a shitty one at that considering how that heart works.
---
Hm, I don't think you're getting them to low enough health? Maybe try hitting them a little more before you fire off the net?
---
If not, you might have to ask Support for help. Send a ticket in.

Adding to the mystic clover section, it may be worth emphasizing that failing forge attempts for mystic clovers will reward crafting materials, including T6 mats and high level wood/metal etc, many of which are relevant for other gifts.
---
Clovers are first in the document but it's probably good to just explicitly emphasize that, if forging to get your clovers, you should do the clovers before you spend money or other resources obtaining T6 mats and the like for other gifts.
---
it's not flying but its idling in the air... Wouldn't that be flying?
---
As in every story these days; we solve it with quantum mechanics.
---
Should add that several non-repeatable WvW and PvP tracks award 7 clovers instead of two.
---
The best way to think about it is: it's a glider that lets you hover indefinitely.
---
It loses altitude as you move, as a glider does, but you can remain on spot - airborne - as long as you want.
---
Meaning, it's just a better glider in areas where you can mount.
---
True; got my words mixed up there. Cheers! Regardless, it would fit thematically with Almorra's arc if such ever came to pass. :)
---
No reason to go there though. It would have been a perfect location for a chak raid, but we got an overdose of White Mantle raids instead.
---
Lewd and puns?
---
These levels of fabulous are highly illegal.
---
Just finished catching up with the story content. That ending was epic and sad, I'm shocked.
---
After reading some stuff about Joko, something has been bugging me. What was his plan if he wasn't killed? Would he become a servant of Kralkatorrik or would he try to slay him? Why didn't he join us to fight the dragon? He just wants destruction for itself because he's a psycho?
---
Her death can be a motivation to move forward, maybe her spirit can be a pseudo consultant. Just because she's gone in the flesh doesn't mean she has to be gone in spirit/story as well.
---
But returning back in the flesh is a very big nono. Even if she gets some "psychological scars" that will never actually affect her in a tangible way.
---
The difference with the commander's death is that it wasn't a climax, nor was it a cliffhanger.  Its purpose was not to raise the stakes, its purpose was to introduce us to joko, and for anet to showcase gw2's entire story in a motivatiory flashback sort of way. 
---
I do agree that it was a bit quick and without a lot of consequences, but the difference is that it fundumentally was trying to accomplish a different thing from aurene's death, so it can get a pass.
---
Yes and no. You are in the air but it has no practical value.
---
What does hovering give me besides showing off my gemstore skins?
---
they specifically said they did that intentionally so it wouldn't take away from the other mounts though. Making them useless. It's their way of balancing the mounts. Thats why griffon is still the fastest but cant fly. The dragon can (in your case) "fly" but with a slow decline depending on if they move outside of their flight radius. And the springer can still jump the highest of them all. Which is faster than the wall climbing in theory.
---
I used a yugioh card as daft as that is, Saambel the Summoner, crazy necro circus entertainer
---
It's because the character changed. Pre-HoT your player character was an adventurer, post-HoT your character is a military commander.
---
Also Season 2 is on sale for 896 gems right now, though it says "Sale ending soon." If nothing else, just for the background story before HoT.
---
Hmmm, based on the title of that video, looks like that patch was just a few months after the game came out. I was playing since the game came out, but I didn't notice the change then and have never felt bad about how the jumping works in the engine, but good riddance to people jumping up walls. To each their own complaints I guess. *shrug*
---
i don't see the dredge being main antagonists. they might ally themselves with the main antagonist but not be the main.
---
[I present you, Asuran Name Generator.](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/asura_names.php)
---
We recently saw the dredge at Thunderhead Keep, won’t spoil the episode for you but they played a decently important part!
---
As for the future, if we ever go to the Far Shiverpeaks I assume we’ll encounter them again in some form. But their peak was probably vanilla through LWS1, and they’ll live on in fractals as part of the Molten Alliance.
---
Really? That's actually kinda a shame. But I suppose I'm always free to just \*not\* use my mounts.
---
Also you can climb to reset the flight radius iirc. So if you're in a region where cliffs are close enough together you could fly infinitely I'm assuming
---
Or Grunt! (Mass Effect)
---
That's true, though they're really going out of their way to show us nothing that's in the update beyond the new legendary and the armor set. Normally they have lots of footage of the new zone so that leads me to believe the zone is a spoiler in and of itself.
---
Love the poster looks well done, as if anet made it, Braham doesn't fit all that well tho it stands out awkwardly
---
I assume yes, but will all the quips like combat skills ("For Great Justice" skill, "And I deserve it, too" when looting, etc.) get the new voice? I know old personal story cutscenes and outspoken dialogue won't but it would be weird to hear two different voices between spoken dialogue and triggered quips moving forward.
---
I wouldn't expect Bond of Vigor to work. Bond of Vigor refills the endurance bar, which isn't the bar that controls if you can fly upwards. And given that you can infinitely hover it would seem rather broken if the bond did refill it.
---
Kinda a minor character, but I hope Codename: R3D-RCR(https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Codename:_R3D-RCR)survives, his golem was seen in the last platform that Kralk branded, but it wasn't shown if he was piloting the golem directly or remotely.
---
Now that you mention it did we ever get a good idea of what the Path to Revelations message was referring to? Just Orr and Zhaitan?
---
I think the main intended challenge of that is to know the locations of the orbs and not so much about getting to the so that makes sense. It is even in the name "Scavenger's Chasm"
---
I really hope to see Almorra get her revenge on kralk for her warband, good to see her back regardless.

Infectionator Eppi.

&gt;"For it may be that death is not the end but, possibly, the end of the beginning."

Me: "And why am I wearing the watermelon on my feet?"
---
Honestly having the fight end up next to the water, and then right when Kralk is about to die you just see this gigantic water terror launch up, grab him and then disappear into the depths.

I've heard this song many times in Lion's Arch and I've always loved it. For anyone else who watched the TV show, "LOST" - this one always reminds me of the score from the show (which I also loved).
---
it worked during the stream rewatch it. theres a brown bar that appears if you fly outside your flight radius . Bond of vigor resets the brown bar allowing the green bar to fill all the way to max
---
DSD will always be bubbles to me.

I dont get any of the jokes but I still love it.

Excuse me, did you just assume the commander's gender?

Developing an expansion is expensive. As an example (with fictive numbers):
---
If it takes two years of development with a 100 people team: a very rough guestimate: 100 people, everyone results in 100.000$ costs: 20 million $. How much is Anet earning per box sale, after all others in between got their share? 10$? Means you need to sell 2 million boxes just to break even. Want a 10% return on your investment? 2,2 million boxes. How many active players are left? 200k? How many would return for an expansion?
---
Now if you are able to develop an expansion with 10 people: good. That's why some very old or small games still get new content. If you manage to attract many new players an expansion might also be worth it. But as example pof had nearly no coverage on gaming websites/magazines. Apparently is "GW2" not generating enough clicks to be worth reporting about it anymore. Also see: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=guild%20wars,guild%20wars%202
---
The people who want a lot of KP will know you are lying after the first pull. The people who want a lot of KP want it for a reason. They are looking for people who know the fight inside and out, not just cleared it a couple times.
---
Besides, very few raids groups even really have this requirement. Almost every group that I join eventually even gives up on the "ping KP" requirement as a whole when just trying to find one or two more people.
---
I personally don't find the dredge to be appealing to listen to or look at. I think they have character but damn their machinery is ugly to me and Id rather sit around Black Citadel.
---
They've already been a part of the molten alliance so I can't see them being included in much more. I suspect new mobs
---
So first off, the optimal path in[ GW2E for gathering nodes](https://gw2efficiency.com/gathering/permanent-nodes) just orders them by closest node to closest node. It ignores profit and just looks at distance to minimize travel time/cost. So if you follow all that many nodes come out to a loss if you are just waypointing to every one. For instance the grapes in the first node are 68c while the base cost is 1s39c for waypoints at 80. So it's really best to skip the nodes under 2s if you're just going for profit.
---
If your only goal is gift of magic/might then you're better off doing more profitable things first (istan, HoT metas, Tequatl, silverwastes, fractals, etc). If you have the volatile magic tools you can use the gathered magic on [volatile magic shipments](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trophy_Shipment), [trophies are the best now](http://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html).

Wish i could fake my life
---
its slow and people will see the difference
---
Really? So no expansion and no new map for each episode? I didn’t know :(
---
Dude, predator is like my fav weapon in the game lol.
---
I think the Dredge were given their due during Core GW2 and LS1, and they get some brief appearances where it fits.  I don't see a lot of potential left for them, contrary to many other races. 
---
Then again, the devs can always get creative. Maybe they will somehow become relevant once the thought-to-be-extinct Stone Dwarves return from the Depths...
---
I was always saying that if you don't have enough LI to PUG raids then you probably shouldn't PUG raids. You should get into training/semi experienced guild instead of getting on 9 other people nerves.
---
theres people who have killed dhuum 100 times and still dont know the fight. if i think that i can handle it after 30 kills then im fine with faking the 70 missing trophies :)
---
what if im not getting on anyones nerves because theres no difference between 50 and 100 kp?
---
Meta events, collections of all sorts, farm for legendary weapons and gear, PvE Raids, Achivements, WvW, PvP, unlock the Griffon collection, hunting for looks you like, mastery farming, gold farming, level new professions and learn to play them, Gain first spot on all adventures and races, festivals, special events are some of the things you can do.  
---
Why don't you like fractals?
---
It’s because of the rune update that requires 1 very expensive item to make it:
---
• 1 Pile of Lucent Crystal
---
• 2 charged silver
---
• 1 tiny totem
---
• **[1 charm of brilliance](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charm_of_Brilliance)**
---
One charm of brilliance costs ~ 1 gold. It’s such a rare material that is for some reason required in minor runes.
---
but there is?
---
I didn't know about this new road, that's a pretty good sign that ANet will release something there soon. I find it hard to fit the terrain in the trailer to that particular spot on the map though. Maybe it's an upcoming raid or story-related instance?
---
We also have that door in Fields of Ruin that allegedly leads to the crystal desert. I really hope that is opened up before Living World leaves the desert behind.
---
yes, 50 trophies. if there is no difference in gameplay then whats the point?
---
So friendly  that every single question thread is immediately downvoted!
---
And I thought Draconis Mons and it's 16 day long "journey" was exhausting but Vabbi with 8 hearts? Woah!
---
Never been an issue for Anet. 
---
I've played on Linux with wine since the first beta weekend. Played GW1 before that. Even contacted support and they said it was all good. 
---
Anet devs have even commented on Reddit posts about running GW2 on Linux
---
They're not humans, but male and female charr do behave subtly differently and there do seem to be different gender expectations in charr society (example: most named Primus/cub instructors are female). If you look at female charr dialogue and male charr dialogue in-game, you'd have a pretty good chance at being able to tell the gender of the character. 
---
It's a sign of quality writing by ArenaNet to be able to write strong female characters without making a male character and then making their appearance female, which is something a lot of writers miss.
---
Time to hunt some prey...
---
Oh I am not saying Cele Ele Meta wasn't a thing. I very well remember the esport final with 8 Eles and two Rezbot Thieves.
---
But Cele Engis and Warriors were far rarer as you make them to be. Thief never was and never will be the king of burst damage as long as Mesmers have a Greatsword and Dual Pistol Thief only took off after HoT.
---
While guard was the best bunker, it was by no means the only one. Engis had their share of bunker build, especially during the reign of the Thumber Turret. Condi Ranger ran basically nothing but condi damage, evasion and toughness. Warriors always had a shield and it was a niche offhand before HoT.
---
And Holo.
---
Meanwhile Ele gets pistol/any bow/shield.
---
The way they've been presenting the replacement situation has been that the replacement's important role is balancing The All, not magic, so whatever contains the magic must be able to connect to the All. If it were merely containing magic, then there was no point in antagonizing Balthazar into becoming an enemy during the S3 finale (resulting in him doing his mass murdering of Elonians).
---
One could argue that Balthazar could fulfill both roles, but he would have left thus breaking the balance of the All anyways, but I doubt that a bloodstone could do the same. Plus the Forgotten stated they couldn't make another one ("do not have the divine resources" or some such) in HoT's A Study in Gold, and the Seers are all dead. So we probably can't make another bloodstone.
---
But the whole "balancing The All" also indicates that we shouldn't be able to just kill Kralkatorrik in the Mists and all be well. If it were only the balancing of magic, then we could, just as we could have let Balthazar kill Jormag and Primordus by consuming their magic (4 out of 5 of the races the PC could be wouldn't care about Balthazar going back to take vengeance on the other gods, and human PCs didn't know he was planning that yet either).
---
In regards to turning himself off, an external force should be able to turn him back on. Even if it takes a bit more effort than flipping a switch.
---
The only question would be if his golem body could really withstand being branded while inside Kralkatorrik's gut.
---
I've seen male primus npcs. Charr also don't dress differently from male to female. There are also many female charr npcs with very low, gruff voices. A lot of people I know who aren't familiar with playing charr often mistake females for males. The only charr that care if you're male or female are flame legion. 
---
A female is just a person who can be anything, they don't need to adhere to gender stereotypes, especially when they're an animal.
---
Shouldn't Caithe still sense her then?
---
My theory on that is that it'll lead to the next raid wing, as it leads to the hidden djinn city from GW1, and the next raid deals with Qadim again.
---
...because the difference still exists, even if you really believe otherwise.
---
The rifts in Jahai change the sky around the rifts too, and there's no such effects in the sky in the trailers. So that seems unlikely to me.
---
  **Returning player confused by Mesmer Meta, help?** 
---
Hi guys! So I've been away from gw2 for over a year, got back to it yesterday.
---
I have a level 80 mesmer with full exotic Berserker gear and Berserker ascended trinkets.
---
I'm not into pvp, so I've always liked doing fractals and open world events. I would like to try Raids in the future but this is where I'm "stuck" at, looking at MetaBattle I saw that Diviner gear is a thing now for Mesmers and also Assassin's gear.
---
Oh and I don't have PoF, just HoT. My questions are:
---
1. Considering that I'm a pve player should I forget Berserker status and focus on getting ascended Diviner armor orrrrr Assassin's?
---
2. Is the greatsword no longer viable for pve? I saw builds focused on sword/sword, sword/focus, sword/shield etc... but GS seems to be out of meta which makes me sad cause it's my favorite weapon lol.
---
Thanks in advance! :)
---
&gt; but the nodes I remember existing are no longer there anymore
---
Their locations are randomized unless you are returning to the same instance every time.
---
The one in the picture is correct and make sense, she's winding up for the gravedigger attack.
---
It depends a lot on the supply and if there are other sources for the runes. Take [undead for example](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/24759-Minor-Rune-of-the-Undead) leading up to the rework in november they were worth nothing, people bought a bunch and the supply went from 2k to 40 pushing the price up. Then since it wasn't cheap or easy to make any more and someone bought the cheap ~20s ones all that was left were the higher ~1g ones. With the price that high anyone that had some saved up started listing them and the supply is back to 1,200. It's still a very strange market though since as far as I can tell the only reason to buy them at all would be to flip them for profit. You can see the [same thing with scholar](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/24834-Minor-Rune-of-the-Scholar) except there wasn't a restock of runes so the supply is still low and the price high. Normally a market will balance out the price with where it should be but there is basically no cheap way to restock these and their proper price to craft is over 1g. So eventually when they run out of cheap stocks left over all that will be left are the 1g+ prices (unless people are selling at a loss from crafting). The real issue though is that there isn't a reason to buy any of the low tier runes so who knows if most of them will ever run out of the cheap supply.
---
It's because they keep trying to put their pay to win store in the west and we don't want it. Sometimes it's sneaky enough to make it for a bit and whales stay.
---
We use the Queen Jennah's powers to go the past, and we fight ourselves in order to stop us from defeating Zaitan and Mordremod thus preventing Kralkatorrik from becoming stronger, making the fight in the present easier.
---
At the end we defeat Kralkatorrik and realize that the other 2 dragons are alive and we have to kill them again, revisiting dragon's stand and the ruins of orr
---
\-The FBI would like to know your location
---
Some at FE linked 155 bonus boxes...and this just under 40 hours into the event. That's a lot of work and very little sleep for 155 silver ore.
---
Eh, its a bit of a stretch but I see what you mean.
---
The skyscale as a whole doesn't seem very useful to me. I can't imagine anything you can do with a skyscale that you can't already with a springer, a grifon and faithleap.
---
ArenaNet: Allied forces suffered massive casualties in the battle.
---
Guild Wars 2: -literally no known named NPCs died-
---
Just like when the Pact Fleet fell!
---
^(Before you mention Eir and Trahearne, they died after the Fleet's destruction.)
---
For Fractals get Diviner Trinkets and Diviner Weapons with Sigill of Concentration. Use Rune of the Pack on your Berserker Set instead of Sholar. Use Buffood and slot your equip with +9AR in every item. This way you get 100% Boonduration relatively cheap and Pack rune is way more usefull than Sholar on Chronomancer Support.
---
Chrono Support only deals like 15k burst dps to begin with, if you add 5% from Sholar thats nothing and its better for your team if you can keep up some Might and perma Fury on all Bosses. I'm really no fan of Sholar on Supporter classes tbh.
---
For Raids you can't cheap out and dupe around with Boonduration from potions through  Infusions like in Fractals, you need to get Diviner gear too and thats kind of expensive.
---
Diviner set is worth it! If you get Trinkets and Weapons you can allmost also play a Renegade Support in Fractals too since you'll use the same Weapons and just need another Sword and Staff.
---
If you go for Assassins gear thats only really usefull if you have both a Warrior and Druid for Banner and Spotter buff, you can do that if you have premades you run with everyday - if you pug I'd not bother.
---
Thanatologist Mystic 🤔
---
Any of the zzzzz tanky infinite sustain builds. That probably means something like boonbeast, sword weaver, holo, scrapper, or just full aids scourge. In the old days condi reaper would have been top of the list too but that's been nerfed back into sanity (it would probably work fine still, just with a lot less damage).
---
Occasionally yes
---
WBs were never my favorite thing to do consistently, but it was sometimes fun to just pop in to do a specific one in my down time, mostly teq or jormag. 
---
But even with the bonus rewards and the crowds of people, I don't like doing WB trains
---
SWEEET!
---
Ah yes my friend just forged some clovers last night. Believe he got some juicy gossamer scraps back.
---
I still miss the old VA. It was so much better. So much more charr-like in my eyes.
---
The problem is that I'm broke and swapping stats in the forge costs a lot. I already got the beetle today, but taking it slowly with re-gearing. All my gear is outdated for raiding and fractals, except for my guardian.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Duuuude i thought sidekick has died, so glad to see it back in action! Love the neat menu it has.
---
Main reason i unintalled it because it took days to sync stuff properly. Maybe it was on my end but eh, will try it again
---
So I’d need an alt to find another instance with access to different nodes?
---
