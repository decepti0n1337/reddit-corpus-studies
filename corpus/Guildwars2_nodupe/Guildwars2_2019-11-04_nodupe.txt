I have been playing now for about 5 months. I bought GW2 not long after release in Feb 2013 then didn't continue to play. I relate completely to what you are saying for the most part. I adore the game right now. If there is one thing that annoys me a tiny bit, it's the inability (on some maps, certainly not all) to get content completed because they are so little used. Things like the Cin's Business collection for which I need one piece from a particular event.
---

---
Having said that, in any game when content has been out quite a while the majority of players have already taken what they need from it, so I completely understand how this happens. GW2 is fantastic, I can see myself playing for years.....
---
---
---
I love your simple approach to life. Especially how you think your subjective analysis is objective but other peoples' isn't.
---
Shit like this is the only reason I am still subbed to this sub
---
[removed]
---
Ok, so what is your counterargument to "fewer people starving is better than more people starving?"
---
And just to elaborate on that, the "Festival Collections" achievement under the Collections tab isn't considered a "festival category" despite the name.
---
Its a convenience that saves you 10 seconds max if you know your shit around changing traits, making fun of people that cry for 10 seconds is fine in my book
---
damn, Mo'.
---
That stuff can still be done, it just has to be organized. It's an MMO, you can't do it alone, but you can organize. The worst time to try to organize is during a festival though.
---
&gt;But it is fair to be unhappy with how he covered it; though, instead of missing key points I think it might have been that he didn't want to go into all the details that informed his opinion since the video wasn't solely about Build Templates.
---
That's a fair point—and you might well be right—but that would make the matter worse, not better, in my opinion; purposefully downplaying concerns that don't fit his narrative is worse than ignorance, to me. As to not wanting to go into details, well, he should have addressed it fully or not at all, I say, because as it is he gave a very one-sided account of the matter and dismissed everything else as "whining".
---
Except there is a need for a tutorial. You are saying that there isn't a need for one when clearly players are missing a lot of information on how aspects of the game works. Does the game tell you how to use the wiki? Does the game point you to outside sources? Does the game accurately teach you how to play the game, breakbars, what to look out for etc. There is a reason games have tutorials IN GAME. It is your OPINION that the game doesn't need an in game tutorial, clearly he did not agree with that opinion.
---
They sure can, even though the system is almost always misused.
---
Why should I defend the other side of a proposition I didn't assert except if I wanted to indulge in a pointless intellectual exercise? Also, are you so uncreative that you *can't* come up with a situation where that could be a subjective statement? 
---
Because I love embarrassing you, I'll indulge you. From a utilitarianist standpoint (though mind you I'm not utilitarian) one could easily argue that three extremely productive people not-starving is better than four unproductive people not-starving. 
---
Or how about a group of 7 people, and only enough food to feed 4 people. 3 of the people are normal, healthy people. 4 of them are sadistic serial killers. It would be hard to argue that the group would find positive value in keeping the one of the serial killers fed.
---
You could come up with countless scenarios like this. I'm not particularly well versed in philosophy but I think you'd find a lot of value in reading this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
---
Hope this has been educational for ya.
---
So judging by the static-y video, the Boneskinner is an angry moose?
---
Another door that swings both ways.
---
So you buy items outside of the game, you just provided evidence of it, what is the issue?
---
He doesn't pretend that at all.
---
Well they designed game on no reward system.
---
&gt; awesome would the templates be, since you could have many build as ressing builds, open world builds, niche builds and how much the system would open new build possibilities
---
But this the case, you can have all those things you listed here.
---
Unfortunately it won't collapse. Doesnt   change the fact that all these are garbage games though.
---
He has talked about it many times before and I am sure he'll do so after. Why are you so sure he wouldn't talk about or address it again? That just seems uninformed and silly.
---
99.99% of the players aren't effected nearly as much as you think by these templates.
---
&gt;Because I love embarrassing you, I'll indulge you. From a utilitarianist standpoint (though mind you I'm not utilitarian) one could easily argue that three extremely productive people not-starving is better than four unproductive people not-starving. 
---
Interesting. You you believe that it is better that one person starve than that four people be less than maximally productive. 
---
That checks out. 
---
&gt;Or how about a group of 7 people, and only enough food to feed 4 people. 3 of the people are normal, healthy people. 4 of them are sadistic serial killers. It would be hard to argue that the group would find positive value in keeping the one of the serial killers fed.
---
If you had a group of 7 people, 4 of them serial killers, I don't understand how the other three would have any say in who gets fed. 
---
You really seem to be splitting hairs here to defend an inherently amoral position. I'm sorry, but I just have higher ideals about what a game should be, and they're incompatible with your cynical and self-interested world view. The fact that ANet is supporting Extra Life seems to indicate that they *should* be on my side of this.
---
You sounds very uninformed on WP and his opinions and stances on Anet and their practices.
---
99.99% of the players don't even come to reddit.
---
It's not what I expected and I think it could be better in certain aspects, but it's not total shit.
---
Be a bit more grown up about it mate.
---
I saw a whole squad rp walking across Orr one time in the early days, was pretty cool to run into randomly.
---
I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to sell for excess; kinda like how bag slots work where you get enough to get by but if you want/need more space you can extend them further. For all parts of build templates, I'd say it wasn't as good of a ratio for free as bag slots. And it is even messier since bag slots weren't something you could extend for free with addons that got taken away to sell them... And if the equipment loadouts were actually templates, it would be easier to argue against the gem cost since they wouldn't hold items and rival bag slots.
---
Show me an mmo that has a tutorial on every single facet of its gameplay. Every single one. There arent any, not wow, not ff14, not tera, not one.
---
And if youre honestly telling me if you have the ability to learn, and you decide not to thats someone elses fault for not teaching you then thats ignorant and very telling.
---
Also ill tell you now, they dont need a tutorial, because if they did we wouldnt have players who can clear end game content easily.
---
LOL, that's literally not an opinion. Going from what it could be to "not my problem" is ditching the issue.
---
I mean there is a difference between free and aggressively monetised. There is a nuance to the monetisation, it's not all or nothing.
---
Also, some other B2P games offer similar features for free. So it's not even completely delusional to expect them for free. Though I agree in the context of GW2 it is definitely unlikely to expect it.
---
In that case, it's time to get a job rather than playing video games.
---
True, I guess it would be casual vs hardcore in essence.
---
I cant play the game for a few more days because work. What does this over priced bundle give?
---
by your description,we dont even need templates XD
---

Depends on the person. I've spent far, far less money on Guild Wars 2 than I would have spent on any other subscription game over the same period of time. I hardly ever get anything from the gem store and I've never bought things like black lion keys. I don't feel like my enjoyment has suffered at all from not buying things from the gem store.
---
Put character display on low and character model on low. Its settings for OTHER players on screen so that your computer isn't rendering 100+ players at a time. The game runs fine on low end computers. You can find the 2 settings on the bottom of the graphics settings.
---
Anyone have a link to the [FF] one?
---
Yup, seems about right.
---
Not gonna buy it atm. What's 7 years when i can wait another year or two for the discounted version.
---
I’m thinking of going head first into this game I’ve been looking for something to spend a good amount of time on. My questions are is it worth getting into as a completely new player at the moment? And if yes what classes would you recommend?
---
It's a relatively minor inconvenience, but the bigger issue is that Anet decided it was good enough to release as a "feature". In its current state it is worse than before by far. As in, it doesn't deter me from playing the game, but it does make Anet look like they don't know what they're doing at all.
---
I have two places I rotate between for map completion.   My favorite is the Moot in Timberline, where you can stand on the table to boast and the crowd cheers for you.  The other is Meatoberfest in Diessa, where you can have a drink and get a pack of fireworks to shoot.
---
It was only for people who owned Heart of Thorns before it got packaged in with Path of Fire. If you didn’t own it before then, you can’t get it.
---
Yes. It is.
---
Let him enjoy it for what it is and leave your bitter vet bullshit at the door.
---
I guess that's always up to my obsessive curiosity when immersed in something. If I play something and I get hooked, I WILL want to know EVERYTHING I can about it to be able to optimize my own setup for a more streamlined gameplay experience. This doesn't absolutely mean I'll grind out absolutely everything to get the absolute best gear possible, I'll only get what's reasonably strong within reason. But ultimately, if I am to do so, even as a casual player, I don't want to be forever stuck on not knowing how to choose between personal story mission rewards where you get 3 of the exact same weapons, each with different types of stats and not knowing what they do. I at least figured Vitality and Toughness are defense, but knowing that there's different types of damage, Ferocity, Precision, Power and whatnot could mean different things, just like in Warframe, 'Condition' from my understanding is pretty similar to what Warframe calls 'Status' whereas Precision is just classic crit stats.
---
I guess I just don't like the feeling of not knowing things in fear that I may accidentally unknowingly throw away really good gear (or at least suitable gear for how I want to build/play)
---
My argument that the wiki is simply not enough of a tutorial to learn the game.
---
I know I am certainly guilty from time to time of not seeing the other side of the discussion.
---
Absolutely worth it. Complaints you see around here are generally from veterans who have played everything in game and want even more content. As a brand new player, there’s tons of content that’s new for you. 
---
What class? Try some out and see what you like. Different classes have different strengths and play styles. You know better than me what you like. Mobility? Sturdiness? Group support? Complex, simple? Pets? Let us know what you’re looking for, and we can try to guide you.
---
Here’s my top three change wishlist:
---
1) Make all 24 templates free  
---
2) +1 equipment AND trait template per account for each owned expac (4 total if both for equipment, 5 total if both for traits)  
---
3) Set swapping able to do both equipment and traits with one hot key
---
I think this would get the player base 90% of the way there.
---
I tend to like agile characters followed by ranged.
---
Anyway, thanks for the discussion. 
---
Take care.
---
:)
---
Ashes of the Just precast memes.
---
Just take the compliment.
---
No, it doesn't. The only thing you can get from " Its easy to like gw2 as new player. " is that people who are new have an easy time to enjoy the game. It does not make a statement on any other type of player at all. You added that interpretation yourself.   
---
But lets for just a moment assume you are right, it still doesn't mean that the game is bad for non-new-players. By comparison, it might be worse, but that doesn't mean it is bad. You instantly jumped to an extreme for some odd reason.
---
I honestly don't know why you're wasting your time, it's clear this is beyond their ability to understand. I doubt they even understand how much they're embarrassing themselves.
---

It'll be good only in situations where your walking up to gank people. But in group fights or camps you may die. Ill advise slapping shadow portal and remembering to place it down if your sneaking up on a dude that way you kill him his mates notice you port out and live. What secondary wep set you planning to use? Personally ill find it risky since WvW roaming at least solo is non stop gank.
---
Then if you don't have it unlocked, contact support.  You should have it.
---
Let me know what that goes to after eating Taco Bell.
---
"I have not enough knowledge about something and I can't do it ? must be a hack/cheat"
---
Right, a completely free game where everything that costs money is optional, is nothing but a money milking machine.
---
Exactly. They could also charge monthly subscription if there’s enough contents and consistent updates. The current business model is a total failure in comparison.
---
[cries in Random Arena]
---
This is the most Guild Wars thing I’ve seen in a long time.
---
It’s not Guild Wars 2, though
---
You think it's linked to Anet and someone did it out of spite?
---
I appreciate it.
---
&gt; and best casual mmo
---
Other mmos have just as many casuals or maybe even more.
---
If you're on NA and want some help on Cin Business or any of the s3 stuff, DM me your in game name.  I do that content a lot (both peak and off-peak hours) and help people get their achievements.  Let me know.
---
Shit post is best post
---
Lol, Anet is going to nerf templates in all modes because of this. Something like 30-60 second cd between swapping builds.
---
Then that’s going to upset others even more... SMH... such a mess of things.
---
Regardless of whether it is rare or not, it is used as a buff for benchmarks
---
A downvote? Why?
---
Maybe it’s because the poster has a tag beside his name which says “Wasted Potential Wars 2”. Do you think that could be it?
---
And yet you can clearly see a jump in the conversion rate every time a gem shop item has high demand. Example when the highly controversial first Mount skin lootbox got released: https://imgur.com/a/JHEet6k
---
Yeah. No. 
---
Because his opinion is trash and extremely simple minded and shouldn't be seen as important disc issuing an actually very important topic.
---
People cry about templates, but they are fine, game is fine, come play it
---
Rotations are basically priority sequences anyway though...?
---
That's literally the point of the rotation? To use the skills with the most priority...to deal the most damage...?
---
Any datamines?
---
I always enjoy being accused of cheating.  Not that it happen in GW, because I'm awful, but it has happened in other games.  It's pretty cool.

There's bots downvoting everything so meh.
---
As a "hardcore" player, I say just enjoy the game for what it is rather than trying to grind everything.
---
The only thing you should probably grind is your own skill. Gear will come no problem, skill is literally the thing that separates good personal performance and bad performance in any part of the game both endgame PvE and PvP.
---
and I'm still pissed off about it
---
Completely free? Sure, if you want to play the "trial" version of the game. FFXIV is also completely free then.
---
Just tell your friend that he needs to devote two character slots to a single class if he wants to play them in two game modes...
---
Good solution.
---
The bags you are given without paying gems for them are a hell of a lot better than what you get for free with this system. If they gave you 6 free gear templates for every character and you could buy up to an additional four for each character individually, we'd probably be having a different conversation.
---
&gt; If the price for the templates bothers you, don't buy them. If much fewer people buy the extra templates than Arenanet anticipated, change will come.
---
I think it's incorrect to say that people only need to do that. Being vocal about why you're not buying them is also important. Otherwise anet could come away with the conclusion that eg it really is just a vocal minority who wanted them... although they'd probably be hard pressed to come to that conclusion by this point lol.
---
That's a new thing and still not consistent across the game. Also the strings do get messed up sometimes between patches and don't always get fixed within a reasonable timeframe.
---
Same with their "Hold Shift to get more info." Some skills it gives a more detailed, numeric description. Others will only add a sentence. Some will just add an extra line break or two. And many will not do anything (or, in some other cases, just "do nothing", as in, it accepts the alternate text, but has no extra text).
---
It seems all ncsoft is good at is finding studios whose management is dead set on sinking their own game, just like those cunts at Wildstar who doomed the game and then failed their way to the top by jumping ship and being offered executive producer and designer jobs at Blizzard....this game industry disgusts me.
---
&gt; But also, it's really NOT hard to make gold in the game at all. 
---
Farming like 9000g is not "easy", which is approximately what it would take to max out every character. For most players, including those who really want all those templates, that's months and months, during which time you're giving up progress towards other things you want like legendaries for example. Even if you wanted to do a single character, that's approaching the price of a legendary weapon. Oh and this is just for gear templates, not even counting build ones.
---
Given the complete lack of movement in the price gold -&gt; gems, I think it's safe to say that it's maybe not quite as easy as you're making out.
---
I am glad for you that you don't. Many of us do need this many or even more in some cases.
---
Did vabbi.org shut down?
---
Yeah fair enough, sounds like we basically agree. It just kind of came off to me as if it was being written in response to people whining about it. Sorry!
---
Gold-&gt;gem prices haven't really moved apparently so I guess that's a good sign.
---
Wait somebody actually purchased it?
---
I too love that not telling the player encourages communication between players, but it would be nice if it would tell them to
---
CC! CC MORDY! IT'S GONNA BREAK THE ISLAND! PANIC!
---
or what to do in
---
SOUTH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! ONE MINUTE AND 50% LEFT! MORE TO SOUTH! PANIC!
---
Nah, picnic m8
---
Maybe these can be the f2p version of the templates and they unlock properly with a game purchase then lol
---
True but it isn’t likely. And after they did that I recall them saying something about how that wasn’t good and each thing took away attention from each other and they kinda cannibalized their own game
---
Oh yeah i remember the vid i think it was frifox, maybe search the old forums for it, i think it was there somewhere
---
&gt; The chak infusions have a perpetually growing supply. Unlike legendary weapons they can never be soul bound and can be extracted for less than a gold. 
---
They have a constantly growing supply, but at a rate that keeps them perpetually behind demand. That might be a *step* in the direction I was talking about, but it's many miles short of what it would *need* to be to produce the desired results. 
---
To use Chak infusions as an example of what *I* was talking about, it would mean not just that they continue to drip into the economy over time, like Debeers diamonds, but that the *rate* would actually increase significantly over time, like after six months or a year, they would drop 2, 3, 10, 100 times more often, whatever rate would be necessary to produce the result of a drastic drop in prices. Maybe they would become available through new sources, like Laurel vendors, or other "collection currency" vendors, allowing players who play to get them eventually without having to gamble on the market rates to do so. 
---
Announce this change clearly, don't just quietly increase rates in the hopes players will notice, because that only benefits those who notice it first. Make this policy clear moving forward, so that players will not get their hopes up about future returns on investment, and will understand that rushing for "firsties" is only getting them just that, firsties, and that everyone who wants one will be getting one eventually. 
---
I'm flexible on the policy itself, the goal is the important thing, but there are of course numerous paths leading to that goal, of which I'm certain you're aware. 
---
&gt;To be fair to you, here is my plan, raise the tp cap. I'd raise it to the highest number the bit scale they use can handle. I.e. set it to 216 - 1 or 232 - 1 etc. Get around all this non-sense having to trade with mail.
---
Raising the TP cap does not solve anything, it just mitigates symptoms. The prices would still be high, it would just be easier to collect on those high prices. 
---
Now as for the mail. That's an issue that would need to be solved separately, I believe by taxing items shipped via the mail at a rate relative to long term TP trends (in simplest terms, I'm sure you can imagine the more detailed solution). In another thread we were also discussing the idea of being able to link accounts based on IP, which would allow multi-boxers and families to trade items amongst themselves freely, even if trades between strangers are more restricted.
---
One that is so big you might even want to play Ls2, as well.
---
Actually I would agree on them getting some money of some limited ammount of templates per character limitation.
---
So, build and equipment should be part of the same build and we should be able to hotkey it.
---
We should get a decent ammount of build for free (let´s say a minimun of 5 per character) and have the rest be locked up behind gems.
---
Account storage was not actually a bad idea on top of the previous one. I would suggest 10 spaces for free and rise the limit per account from 21 to 50 or so.
---
That would end up on 5 builds (builds = skills + equipment) per character and 10 builds per account for free. Allowing them getting some money from the system beyond that should not be a problem for the 90% of the playerbase considering that you skill could use some codes to share the combinations and save them somewhere else.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Anyway, IF they would really want to make this absolutely right, they should come up with some kind of account wide shared storage (hello bank? hello inventary slots?) for legendary equipment. 
---
Only then, investing on legendary gear would be actually a real goal since with the templates they just obliterated all the really benefits of investing time and effort on getting these kind of items.
---
If I were them, I would create an extra tab somewhere in the equipment window where you could place your legendary gear so it would be automatically available for ALL your characters instantly. So, if you add weapons, all characters allowed to equip them should have them visible and choosable for their character templates. Same goes for armor where those would become available, depending on the type of armor the character uses. 
---
THAT would be something worthwhile paying for since it really makes things easier for the players and make the legendaries a real deal for those who change builds a lot and play and enjoy GW2 all around the 3 game modes at the same time.
---
I guess D/P :)
---
Well, in this case it's not even about people liking it or not. Since they suppressed the third party alternative (that was arguably better), their offer has no competition.
---
Probably! I tried doing the same thing, but haven't been able to play recently. I'll have to try again once i get everything set up..
---
Because why piss all over someone’s enthusiasm for the sake of some pathetic point scoring?
---
My statement is neutral, the pissing is done in your head by your own prejudice only.
---
Welcome to the community :)
---
If you have any questions about stuff in game or you would like some help feel free to contact me in the game or on here and I'll be happy to help.
---
Keep having fun :)
---
I’m pretty sure they can lock achievements. There’s an achievement where you have to kill Joko minions and I don’t think you can complete it outside of the Halloween event.
---
pretty sure it just turned up in the mail after a while.
---
You've just took three people's statements, and pinned them all on me, while also quoting a side tangent that wasn't the point of my comments, all the while claiming to have understood what I my real point was.
---
Congratulations! You're a dumbass.
---
Is there any fear of the game being shut-down?
---
I'm looking to join and I was reading through posts and found one were a lot of people were complaining about the game starting to cut corners to stay open. I think it had to do something pvp wise but if the game has done something recently that has pissed off a bunch of their players then that's something major.
---
Can you see this game lasting 5 years?
---
&gt;all I can see is just straight negativity and people complaining about how greedy/selfish/incompetant ArenaNET are.
---
They are.
---
Doesn't mean the game is shit; the things it does well it does extremely well. You could say GW2 is a good game *despite* ANet's best efforts in ruining it.
---
Annoying to use, but still worth using in wvw.
---
It's not a gem store item, it's part of a special bundle that was only given to people who owned HoT before it was bundled with PoF. If you don't have it now but definitely paid for HoT, you'll have to contact support and ask for help.
---
pls enlighten us how you know its not 4 downvotes and maybe 245 up and 248 downvotes aka 99% of the playerbase. I will wait.
---
Because I liked where they were at and believed they could improve, or at least maintain the level of quality at the time of purchase. This proved to be a mistaken guess.
---
The other sad reality is that games rarely release as complete packages anymore. Early access is here because it's the only way most indie devs can get a title out the door, and "games as a service" are games that will never stop being developed. There is no "finished product" anymore.
---
Nowhere did they say that they weren't allowed to enjoy the game or otherwise piss on thier enthusiasm. Even if they were I think its perfectly reasonable to warn new players of the terrible state that the game is in for those who are interested in end game content.
---
and who the fuck are you to decide that?
---
Well no. Also had some issues and this could be fixed by the support.
---
I take it as a compliment when people accuse me of  hacking, be happy
---
lol no? you dont make shit up to keep the negativity going, when someone is not on your side. thats not "understanding the issue"
---
It's indeed "only" the burn damage from AotJ that will count as coming from the 1st casting it.
---
AotJ stacks do not compete with each other anymore (I think they used to?) and the Tome skill grants 3 stacks of the buff so as you can see on the video during the precast one can get 10-20+ stacks of the buff. Just like Thief venoms now stack for example.
---
If I understood correctly the idea is the following:
---
* Imagine you have FB1 a Condi FB, FB2 a FB but without any condi damage and Player a random player that's not even a FB
---
* FB1 casts AotJ then FB2 casts AotJ, so all 3 players now have 6 stacks of the AotJ buff
---
* However instead of it being counted (on Player for example) as 3 stacks from FB1  and 3 stacks from FB2 (so contributing to both players damage separately) they are all counted as coming from the person who applied AotJ on them the 1st (for this instance of AoJ not for the whole fight automatically) and only contributing to FB1 damage
---
* So instead of having (after the stack are used) 9 burn stacks from a Condi player and 9 burn stacks from a non-Condi player on the target you have 18 stacks that are ticking with FB1 condi damage and modifiers (which is why it's really only worth/interesting to have 1 Condi FB here but lots of other guards/DH for precast)
---
Elementalist is the class with the most skills that it can use while in combat, 20 alone for the weapon skills + 5 utility skills where with the right skills they also change depending on the element you are using,
---
Revenant is probably class with the second most skills, because he can have 10 weapon skills ( with weapon switching) and 10 Utility Skills ( switching legends)
---
Which class makes the most fun is up to you.
---
&gt; Raising the TP cap does not solve anything, it just mitigates symptoms. The prices would still be high, it would just be easier to collect on those high prices.
---
In this conversation, only you think high prices are a problem. I only have a problem with being forced to use mail trading to accommodate high prices.  I think they are a pointless cosmetic item and I don't care how high the prices are.  If it was basic access to stats, like how minstrels and zealots use to be, or access to runes/sigils I'd have a problem with low accessibility.  But pointless cosmetics?  I think its fine for there to be ultra rare ones.  
---
&gt;they would drop 2, 3, 10, 100 times more often
---
I think this would be disrespectful to the time of people who are active in the game and actually do content when it comes out. A lot of people waited to do things like the funerary collections because they knew Anet would eventually fix the POF metas.  As a result, pof metas were dead very shortly after release.  Content that is dead on arrival is bad for the game.
---
That disputes exactly none of what I just said.
---
Revenant is the most fun. With staff and swords
---
Thanks Man❤....how many skills engineer has?
---
Necro. Always fun to play and as a newish player running minions will enable you to stay alive more. If you have expansions reaper is great fun.
---
More Spelle AS in realy more ?
---
There is "None"
---
20+usable skills per weapon Set alone is much in a fast Combat system 
---
What Level are you ?

What dodnt you like about it ? elemantelist can be Harder to learn when you are New 
---
Dieyng to much ? Not enough damage ? Sustin Support ? 
---
Maybe its the whole gameplqy Loop ?
---
Easy allround proffessions for the start Most of the time are necro and Warrior but both have less spells in Numbers
---
Is it comes with the expansion??  But i didn't bought the extension yet.
---
Thanks for your suggestion...i'll try it❤❤
---
&gt; In this conversation, only you think high prices are a problem. I only have a problem with being forced to use mail trading to accommodate high prices.
---
Well, your solution to your problems is not a solution to my problems, so I don't see why would would agree on yours. If all you want to do is agree with yourself, then I don't understand anyone else's role in that.
---
&gt; I think they are a pointless cosmetic item and I don't care how high the prices are.
---
And that's fine, but just understand that other people do not feel that way, because they want those "pointless cosmetic items," and from an objective perspective, they are more correct than you, since if they did not value these items, they would not have a high price, regardless of rarity. The fact that they do have a high cost indicates that there is a significant gap between supply and demand, so correcting that gap would lead to overall increased player happiness, even if that is irrelevant to you. 
---
&gt; If it was basic access to stats, like how minstrels and zealots use to be, or access to runes/sigils I'd have a problem with low accessibility. But pointless cosmetics?
---
That's entirely a subjective position though, you don't value cosmetics, you do value stats. A different person might not value stats, but would value cosmetics. Neither would be objectively "right," and there's no particular reason why the preferences of one would be honored (ie that stats would be "guaranteed" to have a reasonable pricepoint), while the other should be ignored (ie the price of "pointless cosmetics" would be allowed to rampage out of control).
---
&gt;I think this would be disrespectful to the time of people who are active in the game and actually do content when it comes out.
---
Nope. You can spend as much or as little time on the activity as you choose to. As I say, they should telegraph this in advance as best they can, it should not be a situation of something being very rare at first, and then six months later they announce in the patch notes "and now everyone gets one!" It should be a system in which they make clear that these are rare at first, but that they fully intend to make them considerably less rare after a certain period of time, and less rare still as time goes on. 
---
Lest you forget, **they have already done this on numerous occasions.** 
---
There are plenty of items in the game that were "limited time" event drops or quest rewards that players spent plenty of time grinding over, that later got added to Laurel or Festival vendors at much more reasonable prices. The *only* difference there is that these were account bound items, rather than items that entered the economy as bargaining chips. It is not the "players who worked really hard" that would get screwed over here, but only the "players who bought the item off of a player who worked really hard, intending to sell it at a higher price to another player who had worked very hard, but now cannot because that player can get it cheaper elsewhere." The players who actually work very hard would be just fine. 
---
There are some players who love to be on the leading edge. They love to have the "new cool thing," whatever it is. These players will grind hard for the cool new item, even knowing that other people will have it later. By the time other people will have it, these players will not even care, because they will have already been grinding the *next* "cool new thing," and probably the one after, and already replaced the one they'd had before. 
---
People who don't want to grind hard right away can still enjoy playing the content, and get solid rewards for the time spent doing so. There would always be fun and rewarding content to be running, and players would choose which they preferred doing. 
---
&gt; A lot of people waited to do things like the funerary collections because they knew Anet would eventually fix the POF metas. As a result, pof metas were dead very shortly after release. Content that is dead on arrival is bad for the game.
---
That just seems like poorly designed content. Content should be fun for what you do right now. It should not be something that you'd rather not be doing, but feel compelled to do so in order to get the best rewards. I'm not arguging that nothing should have rewards, but ideally content should be good *enough* that people would still do it even *if* nothing had any rewards, because that is just what they'd like to be doing with their time. This is not work, this is a game. Rewards should be a spice *on top of* a fun player experience, not a bribe used to *convince* players to do something they'd rather not.
---
Damn forgot about the conjures
---
yeah it happens quite a bit. sometimes with roids sometimes with real drugs. thankfully it mostly happens in america 
---
thankfully in my country there is no actual postal system that ive observed in my 39 years
---
Nah, you took their statement and told me I didn't understand it. Then continued to back it up with some bullshit and said this explains their stance. If you fail to express that this isn't your own opinion either while explaining how to justify such a stupid stance on complaints, it might happen people are going to put you on the same side. Congratulations, the only dumbass here is you.
---
probably jeff epstein doing it
---
Something you praised before Anet gave you the chance to praise Joko.
---
Ele skillset depends on your setup. On a meta endgame content regular large hitbox power weaver, you "technically" speaking have:
---
26 weapon skills (20 + 6 dual skills/weapon in weaver)
---
10 conjure skills (5 x 2 conjures)
---
4 from glyph of storms which changes per element
---
Total = 40 skills just like holo
---
This doesn't include the subtle changes from primordial stance in different elements or heal skill choice. All technically speaking though, not like you generally use everything in the rotation...
---
Tempest also has similar number of skills in a general setup:
---
Same thing but 26-&gt;24 due to 4 overloads instead of 6 dual skills.
---
Total = 38 skills

Seriously though the fact that games like NBA 2k20 are universally shat on and STILL selling copies is concerning for the industry as a whole.
---
Bought base game, hot with the gem bundle, pof and I think 120€ In gems for aditional stuff, mostly account upgrades and a skin Here an there.
---
I think engineer probably. Every class feels pretty much just one skill spam while leveling core I dont think a class is very enjoyable until 80 and with the expansions. Saying that mesmer feels fun to play cause what's more fun then 3 clones of yourself beating the crap out of some guy
---
So don't fully unlock them all. Most won't.
---
&gt; Have you taken into account that the company is now like a third smaller than it used to be? 
---
It is, but they supposedly also killed not a small number of other projects people worked on.
---
The post I meant was posted 3 posts before you made yours with a totally non-toxic title. And sorry, but please dont abuse the reddit vote mechanic. Its not a like/dislike button. Thanks.
---
Activately driving out a portion of your community, even if minority, is a rarely a good move.
---
We understand your point. Now understand ours : it is literally unplayable. I need my templates, all of them. I don't even care about the price polemics. I cannot play this game anymore.
---
How can you expect us to just take the blow and smile  ?
---
You should spent your time elsewhere. Game is dying hard
---
This is best way to play game. Doing your quests and stuff while RPing instead of doing some weird unrealistic RP.
---
Blink and you are dead.
---
For elementalist you left out overloads and conjure weapons replacing 1-5 skills
---
U literally paid them for their product and expect them to withdraw it? Lol
---
&gt; Farming like 9000g is not "easy", which is approximately what it would take to max out every character. For most players, including those who really want all those templates, that's months and months, during which time you're giving up progress towards other things you want like legendaries for example.
---
And that is ok. It was always expensive to max out everything, and why shouldn't it be. Sure, the templates are not without fault, but selling them, and making them more expensive for people that want to max out is totally fine with me. Maxing out isn't necessary to play and is mostly QoL. That is exactly what ANet should monetize. They need to make money, and besides looks, what else should they charge for? Monthly subscription? Heck, no.
---
There is! There's often public RP in the cities, especially Divinity's Reach, and a community site [here](https://www.guildwars2roleplayers.com). Good luck!
---
I laughed
---
Gw2 open world content is the best out there.
---
That site: https://www.guildwars2roleplayers.com/ also has a roleplay guild directory both for the NA and the EU side. So finding an rp guild is relatively easy there.

Of course. All the bad things are evil developers. All the good things are the awesome gamers who never go wrong. You are clearly someone who has it all figured out.

Ah, yes, the bullshit subreddit circlejerk is back again. Yes, I'm sure the company focusing on mobile development and heavy gem store cash shops on their other MMOs is the one coming to save ArenaNet, and that they were in no way responsible for a shift in art &amp; design labor over to the Iron Tiger Studios projects.
---
Let's just obliviously ignores the literal cashing out of the new templates under your precious lord and saviour NCSoft.
---
yeah, as you can see, i am good with giving fitting names
---
Isn't EA the company that backed the development for Mass Effect? How can EA be bad? /s
---
I don't disagree with you that it's expensive. Or that they system has limitations. But with 40 plus characters as we discussed there won't be many if any situation where he'll need to buy too many if any build templates or even gear templates really.

Once OP learns about break bars and hard cc you can prob increase that number to better than 80% of most players xD

---
Circlejerk? Nah, not really. Just people with a capacity for nuance beyond your insipid ALL X GOOD ALL Y BAD boolean thinking.
---
You can acknowledge that Mike O'Brien had been shafting the GW franchise in favour of new projects (one of which was mobile I might add). You can acknowledge that NCSoft's intervention and refocusing the studio benefits the game.
---
It's also possible to do both those things without endorsing or condemning every action aforementioned individual/corporation have done.
---
&gt;Let's just obliviously ignores the literal cashing out of the new templates under your precious lord and saviour NCSoft.
---
Like how you're obliviously ignoring that ArenaNet has been overpricing pretty much every single mtx they've ever done, even since GW1's shop?
---
Nope, gotta be NCSoft guys 100%. DAE NCsoft supernazis? Gem store worse than holocaust?
---
*Perfection!*
---
Yeah let's ignore ArenaNet's history of cash grabs, like the halloween skins only available in lootbox in 2012, one month after the release.
---
NCSoft evil. This one isn't a circlejerk btw. /s
---
They are fine.
---
Not in NA
---
Even that can carry multiple meanings. Allow me to first illustrate this with an example. Someone in the nested comments has the tag "Running in circles. Furiously"   
---
This can mean that the game is terrible because all you do is run in circles, could also be meant as a funny reference to people who do that. It could also be something completely different.   
---
So how else can "wasted potential wars 2" be interpreted you ask me? Well for one it's a reference to the title of the franchise, Guild Wars and how 'Guild' has been replaced by wasted potential. Y'know how the original had actual guilds that could go into war with each other and how that was mostly neglected until after a couple of years when they offered us a bad solution? (referring to the arena in Obsidian Sanctum) I think that's a valid point of criticism. But does not mean that the entire game is bad! Hey, maybe he is parodying the people who call GW2 a bad game, ridiculing such statements but only posting positive things about it...Y'know, like this particular comment, we are talking about! So again, why do you assume the most extreme negative case instead of just asking?
---
Lastly, Arenanet has changed a lot. So has their vision of Gw2, and I'm saying this as someone who started playing the GW franchise when Nightfall was released. Honestly, I do feel like they've shifted from being one of the most player-focused companies I have ever witnessed to one that barely cares. YES, I agree that for new players the game has a lot to offer and is overall a great experience. But I think you should note on how common it is for veteran players to express their grievances with ArenaNet and the game. We've seen both the game and Arenanet evolve and it seems that a lot of older players feel a game they love and put a lot of time and money into, go down the drain because of poor practices.
---
There is this bar in divinity reach that I hear people RP in.
---
Some people are into oversimplifications. They want idols to cherish and demons to blame.
---
Thanks for the information ❤❤❤
---
I feel like the only one who actually thinks it's a good system that just needs some improvement.
---
If they made the templates actual templates instead of loadouts (i.e. every change you make doesn't change the template automatically), fixed the bugs, and altered the monetisation, I think we'd have a really solid and functional system on our hands.
---
It really isn't fine though. If you like it, it's whatever i'm sure most of us like/want to like the game that's why we're here, but sometimes you gotta take a look at reality.
---
 No one asked about 10 man content and I posted my message about playing how I want to play just foe this reason.
---
It's a yikes from me, bud.
---
Game's great for a new player, but keep in mind that it's also very easy to power-burst through the content here as you did in Warframe. It might feel that there is an insurmountable amount of stuff to do, but depending on your pace and preferences it will last for a few hundred hours, maybe even a thousand. If you're into group content - it's also very few of it here, and new stuff is added once or twice per year, so most likely what you see now is 90-95% of what this game will ever have in its lifetime. However, going through the fractals and building up your experience to overcome raids is a big fun. I joined raid training discord, and progressing through the group content with friends was probably the most enjoyable thing I did in this game.
---
So take your time and don't rush it. Game's perfect as a side-MMO which you occasionally play to chill. Otherwise be ready to put it down after a while.
---
"Doesn't affect me, so it's fine"

&gt; At this point, Guild Wars 2 is nothing more than a platform for the gem store.

Are there really people that have time to do key runs, but don't have 8 tomes per week to level up to 10?

I really didn't think there were such people.

But I guess if they level to 60 by grinding for the second key, then this would become way more valuable.
---
Look for opjustina. It's about how a hacker targeted the Boston children's hospital.

Great thinking man, keep it up!

Printing a new larger denomination of money doesnt affect inflation if the total monetary supply remained the same. Changing the top limit would have no effect on inflation whatsoever.
---
Well... if they don't touch the block (i.e. block at the net) then it will hit the ground inside the bounds and the enemy will score. And it's not like you have much control of how the ball will bounce when you block in such cases.
---
And the cycle continues...
---
That's real cool!
---
Build Templates are *fine* for people that have no real need for them and a slap in the face for those that do.  They're not really cohesive templates, they have severe limitations and aren't min/max friendly for infusions, runes, sigils (etc). 
---
Objectively speaking, yes, the game is *fine* but I don't know where or why you get off thinking that it's okay to be dismissive of misfortune befalling those that are unsatisfied with being burdened and let down by a major gameplay system.  
---
This sub-reddit is really erratic, and I'm sorry you dislike seeing "drama," but the problem is that native build templates in GW2 have severe compromises that make them less functional, less friendly and less intuitive to use.
---
&gt; [But tbh if you close eye on some minor issiues with developer management this game is amazing to play , especially with friends so stop having big 4$$ pain and enjoy it :3 uwu](https://media.giphy.com/media/zwE4anrOtHYaI/giphy.gif)

Someone tag the nhentai for this number idk how to do it
---
Does this thing about the second expasion activating the first one is true even for "old keys"? Here in Brazil the retailers don't say that buying Path of Fire activates Heart of Thorns, I wonder if there's a case when this information is wrong...
---
Maybe. But build templates (admittedly not including gear) were included with GW1 nearly 15 years ago, and are standard in pretty much every major MMO.
---
Just a heads up, you won't get the true feel of how a profession plays until around level 50 in my opinion. That's when you have unlocked a significant amount of skills (what you call "spells") and a few traits (passive abilities that enhance your build).
---
If you want to truly know what a class feels like 100% then you need to be level 80. However I don't recommend level boosting there because then you won't have learned the class and it'll be very overwhelming.
---
By all means experiment on different classes, you have 5 character slots for it.
---
&gt;  You you believe that it is better that one person starve than that four people be less than maximally productive.

---
&gt; is there a PvE open world build that includes both, the hammer and the shield
---
Unlikely, unless you have a character with three hands. Hammer is a two-handed weapon in GW2.
---
Chrono dead so all checks out

Gina Bushplant
---
I never asked you to argue anything as a pointless intellectual exercise, I asked you to support your position that effectively "it is better that fewer people be happy than that more people be happy." 
---
&gt;I wanted to demonstrate that your supposed objective morality wasn't particularly objective and it didn't take much effort to do so, 
---
And yet you didn't actually "do so," you just presented nonsense arguments that even you cannot agree with. Flat earthers can do the same in support of their own position, that doesn't make them right. 
---
Again, what is your counterargument to "fewer people starving is better than more people starving?" 
---
Why do you believe, outside of your own personal perspective, that fewer players hoarding resources for no purpose other than to "have way more of them than they actually need," better for the game as a whole than distributing those materials such that as many players as want them can have them? 
---
Why would 100 Twilights be better kept in the hands of one player, taking up bank space, than in the hands of 100 players, who would be enjoying playing the game with them?
---
Contrary to popular belief, Reddit is not a singular, one-willed organism, but made of many people.
---
He means that build uses hammer and something/shield

Dikin Maymauf
---
Having said that, if looks is what you want, you could look for other weapons that look and "feel" like a hammer, but are one-handed. Maces could fit that bill.

---
There is no duplication of items. If you use weapon A and upgrade B in template 1, but weapon C and upgrade B in template 2, there aren't actually two upgrades B. You only ever use it once as you cannot wear two templates at once, and you already only can slot each upgrade once per template.
---
There is no need to kill weapon A's configuration if you uneqip it. The configuration should stay stored within the template as the weapon gets moved out of the slot and into the overview panel on the left, but instead it gets entirely taken apart and configurations of runes / sigils erased. This should be done manually though.
---
Though regarding your duplication point: at this point i imagine that the introduction of an NPC that allows you to buy copies of legendary items would provide a fitting workaround for the current system. These copies would carry the "unique" attribute:
---
 - you would not be able to wear a copy at the same time as the original
---
- you would only be able to wear as many copies simultaneously as there are originals
---
 **Example: 1 Bifrost, 2 legendary sigills.**
---
 - you cannot equip a Bifrost copy in slot 1 if real Bifrost is equipped in Slot 2
---
 - you cannot equip copies of your legendary sigills in the weapon(s) in slot 1 if they're used in the weapon in slot 2
---
 - you can equip two sigil copies in another template or on another character, since you have two real sigils, and do this however often you may like
---
 - you can equip a Bifrost copy on another template or character and do this however often you like
---
 - you can have as many Bifrost copies and as many sigil copies in your inventory as you like, all uniquely configured, but equipping them is only possible if that abides the rules as set above. Else, you must unequip the conflicting item manually first.
---
If this would be feasible, i have no idea. But it would help as you could now feed all your templates with unique items instead of equipping one item to multiple templates, eliminating the need for ArenaNet to temper with inventory code.
---
Tbh I think they are fine
---
Can confirm
---
Revenants with the Herald specialization work well with Hammer as a primary and Sword/Shield as a secondary.
---
You can have all 6 builds. You could even have 20 builds. As long as there is no proper save/load function this system will never satisfy the targeted demographic aka people who play lots of builds with lots of variation. If i move my leg trinkets  on another character and then back again, the system doesnt remember the stats i used, it is all scrapped. So i have to "remember" and manually change everything again including the infusions every single time. So no matter how many slots you have this system is a big inconvenience as you are actually forced to play only ascended (if u wanna make the best use of it) and just put all your legendary gear on one character and never-ever switch.
---
These details show how thought-out and polished a system is, but in order to understand it you have to use a system extensively,same goes of arc dps templates, hence the reason i put it like that. I dont care if WP is shilling anet or not, i dont care how much gold and money he earns but seeing the biggest content creator of GW2 missing the mark on such a big issue is not what i expected.
---
If they would add anything like that it would be in form of secondary class possible utility skills. Not  elite specs special skills (f1, f2 etc) and not weapon skills
---
When I recently explained among other things, why this happens, my comment was silently hidden in the thread.
---
Havent changed things for me either. Got 2 of every class so I can play both elite specs. No vanillas and I dont have to worry about new elite specs coming soon.
---
Looking good man! Love the color choices as well.
---
What I meant was towards what happens when you equip an item from your inventory. Then, in your example, weapon A gets moved out of the build templates and gets moved into regular inventory to make room for the new weapon. It now can either take the upgrade B with it, removing it from weapon 1 in template 2, or leave it behind, coming up without upgrade.
---
Of course, loosing other configurations shouldn't be affected in that case.
---
Now, if the weapon does not go into main inventory, but is still used in another build template when you unquip it in one, I can understand that things like stats are reset, but only in the case when it is used with different stats in different templates. In that case it shouldn't revert to the stats of the other template, but it also cannot retain its old stats, as there is no place to store that information. Rather than having the wrong stats by accident later, removing the stats entirely would at least prompt a warning when you next equip it into a template.
---
Anet blessed us with the glorious ability of weapon swapping in combat. You should try it out.
---
It's not negative or toxic to criticise a company when they fuck up real bad ?\_?
---
Did they confirm that change was a bug? I was under the impression it was intended
---
It's pretty established that you're fucked the harder, the more desperate you're in need of templates. This subreddit, like all public discourse, is just physically incapable of objectivity, measurement and basic human decency.
---
Welcome to the death throes of an MMO, you climbed aboard a sinking ship dot grab your life vest (icebrood Saga), throw some money at the capty and Hope for the best
---
You're right. However, from what I've seen and from a totally unbiased side, it's coming across very negative, toxic and bitter.
---
Theres a key difference between constructive criticism and toxicity. Simply compare this reddit and that of Destiny 2. I digress however, wasnt looking to discuss a situation I'm not too versed in.
---
Apologies for assuming that "look and feel" has something to do with "look" and "feel" and thus, with using those weapons together, like at the same time.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
I know that of course. I meant Hammer as main weapon and x + shield as secondary. Or X + shield as main and hammer as secondary.
---
&gt;The first Guild Wars was originally funded by selling content without a subscription fee. That's what made their original business model special. 
---
What. The first game sold character slots and Xunlai storage tabs and all that crap.
---
I thought Snowcrows focus mainly on raids? I always check Metabattle for open world PvE. Don't know what discretize is. What is it?
---
and now we have the internet. with all your info readily available. So?
---
What part of "NO INTERNET" did you fail to understand?
---
FOR A FULLY ONLINE MMO. WORK IT OUT.
---
I basically did everything in roughly 500 hours then got bored, there really isn't that much content
---
Started playing this April. Bought both expacs, all LW content, and around 200€ extra on gem store purchases. After the icebrood saga ep0 release, I haven't touched the game, features as build and equipment templates being sold means I'll never spend a single cent on this company again. Selling QoL features that should be included in a free update for potentially hundreds of euros is the most bottom of the barrel, mobile-gaming-ish tactics I've seen in a PC game ***even including EA titles***, it's absolutely disgusting.
---
Its almost like tutorials exist for more than MMO's, I also mentioned if you own a CONSOLE or buy a SINGLE PLAYER GAME!!!
---
You have made it very clear you didn't read or understand what I wrote so you can stay on your little hate train.
---
Dont listen to this guy. The former is for raids, the latter for fractals. You asked for open world, which is completely different.
---
&gt; What you fail to realize is that being motivated to play the game by the aspiration to own a rare item is a good thing for the game and can actually generate fun for a player from content that they otherwise might not engage in or even find particularly fun. 
---
Sure, to a point. At no point have I suggested just handing everything out completely for free. I just don't see the value in *other players* being the arbiter of who gets stuff and who doesn't. I think that the game design itself should make those decisions, that players should not be able to make those aspects *worse* for other players, and that ultimately, the barrier between the players and those items should be fair and reasonable. 
---
I believe the current implementation fails at this in many ways, with the barriers in front of many rewards being too significant, and with players being capable of hoarding such items away from other players. I do not see any benefit to this.
---
&gt;Everytime I set a goal to have a particular legendary or whatever, it made me more interested in the game and more invested in the game. 
---
That's fine, nobody is taking that away. Why do you bring it up?
---
&gt;If I was able to acquire all those items trivally just for logging in, I would be far less interested in playing in the medium and long term.
---
Sure, probably. Me too. But again, not on the table, why do you bring it up?
---
&gt;I feel like these things will be very beneficial to your muddled thinking.
---
You're the one talking about making Legendary items as log-in rewards, I have no idea where you're coming from with that.
---
This is basically the situation, and it's unfortunate. Due to gold to gems, it means that it's going to be a steep cost and you're going to have to pay a lot whether that's with 1000s of gems or even more 1000s of gold (which is technically free but a lot of game time and incentivizes you to use real money).
---
No, you clearly dont understand the point, so go ahead.
---
People tend to do that a lot, especially in this subreddit. We have reached a point where people just come here to rant or vent or stuff like that because the official forums are tyrannically moderated atm and the situation is just snowballing endlessly and people will come on even stronger until they decide to just leave for other games or Anet actually listens to some feedback for once. 
---
I was happy with the game when i started, i pretty much did nothing but story,achievements and open world and it was fun while it lasted. But autoattacking trash mobs to death and getting everything for no effort becomes boring at some point so i moved on to harder content aka WvW/Fractals/Raids. And then the bubble bursted, i finally saw the big picture and damn it was a bad picture.
---
He didnt suicide, he is just working a 2nd job to afford all the templates he needs on 2 chrono charaters to hold all his builds and gear.
---
That's a pretty conflicting statement, there is no meta in open world and OP uses that word, I just did the reasonable thing and assume he was talking about PvE where a meta scene actually exists, lmao.
---
Fallout 76. My point was that there are dumb people with zero foresight everywhere.
---
repost
---
I beat all cms, got multiple legendary weapons, got max mastery
---
ehmm, from who?
---
tragic backstory
---
&gt; You're the one talking about making Legendary items as log-in rewards, I have no idea where you're coming from with that.
---
You're the one talking about "everyone who wants and item to have said item." That implies that acquisition would be available to the lowest common denominator of effort level, which is, essentially log-in reward, if even that. These aren't hard concepts.
---
&gt;the barrier between the players and those items should be fair and reasonable.
---
Any price that both a buyer and seller agree upon and transact upon is fair and reasonable by definition.
---
Your main issue seems to be that you wish there was a deterministic way to acquire X items without RNG or without being required to trade either on the TP or grey market. From a game design perspective, you have to realize that a variety of rewards obtainable from a variety of acquisition methods, some deterministic and some RNG is actually good for an MMO because player tastes vary widely within the community. If every rare item in the game were available, for a hypothetical example, by an open world collection or scavenger hunt, that displease and discourage a very large segment of the player base. Good game design for an MMO, again, requires a variety of rewards obtainable from differing methods to satisfy the players whose play patterns are excited by one method over another. 
---
Saying that a purely deterministic acquisition method for all items is objectively desirable and all it takes is a single person disagreeing to demonstrate it. And believe me, its more than a single person. Taking anet at their word that 11 million people play GW2, even if 5% of them enjoyed pure RNG rewards thats a significant amount of players whose play patterns deserve attention. You cannot just dismiss people who differ from the herd, even if they are a small minority, and anet wisely understands this.
---
What kind of engineer are you playing? Alchemy and inventions traitlines give every engi spec a ton of survivability and sustain.
---
Your big picture. I don't enjoy raiding. We play for different reasons, and that's okay. There's nothing wrong with that. Your bubble burst. But I'm sure I put as many hours into this game as you and it still works for me. I'm sorry it doesn't work for you.
---
My issue has never really been complaints. It's always been hyperbole.
---
Huh, I always imagined signets to be much smaller, as they were originally in the lore supposed to be rings that fit on your 8 fingers excluding the thumbs (afaik all skills were supposed to be like this). Carrying around up to 8 of these would be tough, I'd imagine. :P
---
Very well made video though. Makes me wish there was a good cinematic or tv adaption of Guild Wars.
---
This has been hauntingly similar to my situation (albeit flipped around). I log in to lead guild missions for my guild, sometimes respond to calls to run dungeons (still bitter about those being abandoned content ngl) and... that's it. Seven years of this crap man, I can't bring myself to keep watching ArenaNet shoot itself in the foot and claim it's fine even as it's developing gangrene. It sucks.
---
but he's talking about this subreddit, not reddit in general
---
The name of the entry in the list isn't what counts, it's the name of the collapsible section. 
---
Festival Collections are in the "Collections" section, so they are not festival achievements, but collection achievements.
---
The key is to ensure that you get hit while you have your F2 up. People will hit you a lot more reliably and quickly than open world goons will. Have fun!
---
The official forums have always been tyrannically moderated. Reddit is the only venue for people to voice their concerns/opinions because in the minds of Anet they can do no wrong, so anyone who challenges their ideas gets banned from the official forums, instead of encouraging productive discussion.
---
I love upright Charr. Not so much hunched over or running on all fours Charr. To me, they look more noble, proud, and formidable upright. I would love the option to stand and run upright without having to keep weapons out.
---
You should have used the Chronomancer icon for the largest angry dude foaming at the mouth.
---
One more hint before you move one to a new character entirely: every profession, including elementalists, has *multiple* playstyles, depending on the combination of weapons and utility skills, and at higher levels traits and gear. 
---
So before you shelf your ele entirely, try out your other options. For example, staff skills are long range, which doesn’t really work while playing alone, so try scepter (medium range) and dagger (melee range) as well.
---
Too messy.
---
There is not a single bossfight which requires a lot movement. Also condi only works if the rest of your group is terrible so that plebwould apply to you first.
---
Alright bro
---
What the fuck
---
I run every class with raid or fractal builds in open world and it has no consequence, what.
---
"It's not a bad system, if they completely replace it."
---
I was going to say, where's the chrono?
---
Top post from the last 24 hours.
---
Also and probably mentioned by someone previously, even tho Herald can use Hammer, he uses it in a very different way warrior or guardian use it. It is a ranged weapon, more in the playstyle of a ranged staff. It has some very interesting skills, but if you are going for a "in your face bruiser style" you'll probably want something else.
---
If you are just looking for the "cosmetic" part of it, you'll love it.
---
&gt; I’m done, cosmetics? Fine. But paying for templates that should have been in the game ages ago? Nah I draw a line
---
How is this any different from buying bag slots, bank slots, or characters?
---
Templates are fine.
---
Whining? Piss off WP.
---
Because the time to develop code/cook spaghetti doesn't pay for itself I guess?
---
He's busy learning the new rotation.
---
You're such a generic stereotype that it's truly hilarious. You can't even tell I've been practically trolling you after your second attempt to "explain" shit that I never once cared about.
---
Different model, different financial status at the time, potentially different people asking for money now, the fact that people said they would pay for build templates in gw2? There are alot of reasons of potentially why monetize it now, i wouldnt even care paying if all unlocks were account wide and more than 6 slots really.
---
Thanks for your information brother❤❤❤
---
As far as I know, they have like, a Chinese region, at least for GW1 cause I see Chinese character names there all the time. Chat too. I think they only offer support in like spanish english and german though
---
They have free build storage.
---
What GW2 calls Build Templates, GW1 doesn't have.
---
That said, the limitation and monetization of build storages remains silly.
---
Thanks brother❤❤❤
---
WvW Roaming is one of the more unforgiving ways to play GW2. You have to be better than your opponent, and there are a lot of cheese builds out there that were patched out of PvP, but still work in WvW.
---
So even if you are good and have a lot of survivability, you will still die a lot.
---
That said, to answer your question, Engi has a LOT of tools for survivability. Here are a few that might help:
---
Core Engi
---
* Rocket Boots (even better if traited)
---
* Elixer S (Toss Elixer S is great too for stealth)
---
* Elixer C
---
Scrapper
---
* Bulwark Gyro
---
* Purge Gyro
---
* Stealth Gyro
---
Holosmith
---
* Spectrum Shield
---
* Hard Light Arena
---
* Photon Wall
---
If you play holosmith you should have nutty sustain with healing turret and water fields. Basically always be leaping through your water fields with holo leap and/or blast them with holographic shockwave. In addition, if you run the meta GM trait for holo, you'll heal whenever dodging (which also reduces your heat, making it less likely to overheat) and the trait heat therapy will heal you as your heat level naturally cools off. It has extremely high sustain, probably too high- so make sure whenever you have a water field you're either leaping through it or blasting it.
---
&gt; Modern games are targeting the "whales" more and more. Whales are people that will buy practically everything the game has to offer for sale, simply because they can.
---
Do you people ever stop to think about how these whales are subsidizing the poorer gamers and allowing them to play and enjoy the game for cheaper/free.
---
...no. Literally all they would need to do to make me happy is increase the cap, fix bugs, add a manual save button every time you altered a loadout, and do something about the monetisation.
---
The UI is fine, the chatcode linking is great, the build preview is helpful, the keybinding is godsend... I think it's a fine baseline system that fits very neatly within the UI and has a fairly intuitive gear linking system. Because there are some blatant issues that completely ruin the system which *can be fixed without majorly changing how the system is designed*, doesn't mean they need to totally scrap it.
---
People saying that content is paywalls is odd. Game doesnt have a sub, and regularly releases expansion like content for free if you log in the month its released. If you didn't you have to pay to unlock it.
---
Like, I love WOW (why cant i quit you qq) but they charge a shit ton of money for content that gw2 provides for mostly free and with arguably better storylines
---
Hmmm, noe I'm trying to remember. Is this an actual NPC? Or just a joke on the silly goldsinks there?
---
[or like a stack of trash tier food for the same effect at a lower cost.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Strawberry_Ghost)
---
&gt; EDIT: Actually, maybe he has blocked me.
---
that would be a shame, cause my own curiosity also remains.
---
My guess is that the game originally wasnt designed with them in mind and they had to do some stuff to figure it out. Everyone asked for them, said they'd pay for them, and then got mad when they charged for them. Yeah stuff is broken right now but I hope they'll sort it soon and such. 
---
But what do I know I'm a filthy casual and dont even use my free ones lol
---
Guess other people have to reply to him and he might see it, unless he has blocked all of us.
---
For me, it's not dismissing the criticisms against the way build templates are managed. That I understand. It's the sheer vitriol in a lot of the posts that make me dismiss the the ones who posted them.
---
Because GW2 needs to finance the GW1 servers...
---
The whole concept of both games is quite different from what actually makes sense. In GW1 PvE you only have build templates because that is what defined your build. Most of your efficiency for the build came from the attributes that you could set individually.
---
In GW2 a build alone doesn't really make much sense because it is just 5 skills (heal, utility, elite skill) and your traits. However, what makes the build efficient is what attribute combinations your gear has allocated to them.
---
Gear templates actively reduce the Inventory slots you need to store the additional gear so they are like additional bag slots. Monetizing the Templates itself is probably just to have them both in sync so that you don't have to pay for one and not the other.
---
However, I don't know why they also monetized the build storage and that I would have actually expected to be like it was in GW1 in which your tempalte is being stored inside a text file on your computer.
---
Erm, GW1 charr do not have such long necks.
---
Don't have any images on hand since I'm on a phone atm and wiki seems to only have frontal shots, but its very clearly obvious that GW2 charr have longer necks with a quick comparison.
---
I'm fairly sure the necks were elongated for the 4 legged running animation.
---
But less bad means better... it's a comparison between two things. If it's less bad than it was, it's better now.
---
I'm pretty sure they do. Only the upright Charr have shorter necks. Lemme log in real quick to see if I'm wrong.
---
Too much mcdonalds I guess.
---
I'm talking about when zerg had a frontline and that's it. Have fun circlejerking about the state of WvW.
---
Yeah, raiders and WvWers, who tend to be "power users" of a feature like templates.
---
I do feel for them to some extent, but I agree that an effective newbie won't really be affected by much of any of the causes of negativity in this sub.
---
At least not for a long time.
---
Just found one shot which showcases Pyre and a hunched charr:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:"New_threats_would_arise".jpg
---
Very obviously immensely shorter than Rytlock's neck. Also shorter than GW2 charr necks.
---
I have the same problem today.
---
Yes that's a ping. I didn't think you could remove the brackets till the second time because the first it is an item not just text.
---
because most of them are mundane questions that have been asked n times that a basic google search can answer. there's no discussion to be had with such threads ppl just answer them 5 minutes after they get posted. it's just not really front page material.
---
When was that? I can't think of a time when there was less of a frontline/backline distinction than now, honestly.
---
After HoT, the "golden age" of double guardian parties. Nowadays you have possibilities of cloud formations.
---
Your bank account.
---
Fun story: 
---
My husband and I duoed path 4 last night. We gave away the 3 remaining slots at the final boss, it was fun! Took us about an hour + 20 minutes.
---
We used a Druid and Reaper for the first boss , Dragonhunter and Reaper for everything else. 
---
It's a really pretty dungeon (the last boss room especially) , and a good challenge .
---
Build discussions aren't simple questions.
---
Determining = hiding the post from all employees until ncsoft decides.
---
I got called out by a deadeye being a hacker, playing hybrid FB. I didnt really know why and at first he would not tell me bc in his opinion I knew I was hacking.
---
Turns out he thought I was wallhacking because I read him like a book everytime he was in stealth and kept cc-ing him.
---
I kind of appreciated his accusations at that point ngl.
---
OK, you're right. Their necks are a lot shorter. Even so, longer neck or no. Their standing posture isn't anatomically correct in GW 2. Center of gravity is off. Their backs, legs and tail can't possibly support that weight all the time. And while they run on all 4 they stand on two, which is the problem.
---
It’s all being pooled to their bank account because template sales failed.
---
New player posts asking something that has been answered a million times and could easily be found by searching on google or this sub in 2 minutes gets downvoted.
---
WvW roaming videos are probably one of the most boring things to watch.  WvW roaming is pretty lackluster and a pretty meme thing to do in the game.
---
You used to see speedrun posts here of dungeons, fractals and raids but since most veteran hardcore players left those posts are few and far between.  Also, the people interested in such things have mostly left the game so when those posts do happen they get few upvotes.
---
What's left of the playerbase in GW2 are mainly casual players who enjoy art and roleplay so those posts will get massive upvotes.
---
Meanwhile, over on other MMO subreddits you see a lot more meaningful discussion about gameplay, releases, strat etc.
---
Oh, the condi rev/condi reaper melee ball era? Yeah actually I'll give you that. There wasn't much of a backline during that time. However I'd contend that it was one of the most fun metas we've ever had, especially near the end of HoT when things were balanced a bit better. Good times.
---
Also I'd like to point out that cloud formation has been viable for a long time, it's just largely dependant on the skill level of those clouding
---
This sub does not like sPvP or WvW posts, it's PvE or GTFO.
---
Hurr durr look at me I'm not stupid I'm just pretending to be stupid. So much about the most generic stereotype. But tbh should've trusted my first thought when I read your account name. Lemme guess, "cringiest online names" google search?
---
And the number that don't go above that is much much higher. Regardless, unless you've cleared every raid CM, every fractal CM, have legendary armor, and broke 35k+ AP, you haven't even finished PvE yet
---
Important piece of community?   
---
lol.
---
They're both a bit spoilery, to be honest.
---
There's still something way wrong with that GW 1 Rytlock.
---
Here's a picture of Rytlock on the side from GW 2.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Rox_and_Rytlock_3.jpg
---
It's not that much longer from the one you showed me with Pyre.
---
I did clear every "challenge" mode, let's be honest they ain't hard compared to other MMOs and I also got a few legendary weapons, with the release of this good awful template there is also less reason to get legendary armor
---
The model is definitely half-assed. But it isn't GW1 rigging's fault for sure, and I think Rytlock is using an emote there that alters the neck, maybe even scrunches it.
---
But it's quality discussion about something they don't care about.
---
It's obvious that it's a problem with the tonic/summon
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Legionnaire.jpg
---
Look at the size of that head.
---
And Gw1 templates?
---
Then why is there a reason to downvote and why can't we have nice things while this doesn't apply to other games which can have actual discussion?
---
I know you're going to eat downvotes and I know I am too, but I agree with your sentiment.
---
It's nice to be able to swap between dps and condi and healspec easily now with hotkeys. I never bothered with ArcDPS because, despite being a convenience thing, it didn't really save me enough time to justify downloading it. Very few people actually cared that it took me ~2 minutes to swap my build/gear around and those that did were assholes anyways. 
---
So, now I get hotkey equipment and gear swaps as well as 40 freed inventory slots. Swapping builds is much easier - but those free inventory slots are *amazing*
---
In russia we know what hard work really is.
---
Because this sub sucks donkey balls. Welcome to Reddit gaming in general, but specifically, /r/guildwars2.
---
Bang up post, and summation. 
---
Happy players don't come to forums to complain.
---
/r/classicwow/ is very similar, sort by new and you'll see majority of posts are either at 0 points or heavily downvoted while still being answered.
---
Sounds like that also applies to bitching about templates but the mods even made a special statement encouraging those threads
---
If people think your main post is stupid they will downvote pretty much every one of your comments inside the post as well.
---
Yea, I kinda got burned out of doing Halloween lab run. Want to grind some for when I hit 80. Turned out leveling is quite easy on the lab with all those guild banners and I'm somehow 80 already. Gotta take some time off to relax before going back to personal story/zones.
---
happened to me as well... It loaded my pve holo build lol
---
I have been olaying this game for a bit now and i have no idea what the fuck this "tempmates" are
---
Ehh, it looks pretty similar in many other subs I am subscribed to, think only /r/totalwar is the exception for me.
---
Only because the bosses take tons of out of game management to fight, including wasting time brewing consumables and whatnot. Tacking busywork onto repeatable content doesn't make it more fun, IMO.
---
Another game i play, Smite their sub has few memes, and a mix of fun posts and gameplay-posts. Only 1 meme a day on the frontpage really and mostly gameplay posts along with some art.
---
Ive never seen anything like this and the speed of instabury here is confusing.
---
In roaming? I imagine that's more an issue for zergs. How many reflects can one character have.
---
Not like complaining about gear templates, which need hundreds of threads all at once
---
That rumor again?
---
IT. WILL. NEVER. HAPPEN. And it shouldn't! EVER. HAPPEN.
---
This game wasn't built with console in mind. It never was and altering it now is a colossal waste of time. And would most likely result in a ton of new bugs NO ONE wants. Definitely not A-Net.
---
It's bad enough that their spaghetti code causes them to break the game when they do far more simple things like add new skins, imagine what would happen if they had to alter that same code to include NEW UI for console and gamepad mode. And the graphical alterations that have to be done to put the game in a console.
---
It would be disastrous. I still have some faith that A-Net isn't as incompetent as everyone keeps saying they are, bugs will always happen, but let's face it. Console GW 2 is just something that is out of their own league. 
---
If the game would have been created with console in mind from the start, sure. Why not?
---
But now? No.
---
Wvw and pvp gameplay related stuff has NEVER been popular here. 
---
It can be made into a meme template where people can relate easily and get popular. E.g. make a meme about having to follow a tag or dying immediately in a sea of red and it might resonate. 
---
Make a gif of a play of the game in pvp or wvw wouldn't even be recognised by most players, much less appreciated. They literally wouldn't even see what you did or how it mattered. 
---
In the past wvw used it's own forums because discussion wasnt allowed on the official forums and wasnt welcomed here. Similar for pvp. Over time popularity of pvp has gone down and wvw is more accepted here, I feel. 
---
This sub was exceptionally aggro towards wvw shortly after hot due to the "content drought" of pve pre and post hot. Generally pvp and wvw were seen and described as money sinks taking away attention off pve.
---
Before the sub got as divided as it was today, it wasnt exactly diverse. It was just as monotone with fluff and only one aspect of the game being discussed here. Anything else was simply buried until the posters left.
---
Nothing changed in this regard, except there being more counterweight whenever anet fucks up a release.
---
If you want to discuss wvw, find your way to certain discords or guilds that can play around builds. Even if this sub allowed discussions without downcoting them, most players arent in a position to discuss builds in a useful manner.
---
shitposting is getting lazy huh...
---
The elitism and gatekeeping in this subreddit has been pretty staggering. If you disagree with them that build/equipment templates are literally Hitler then your opinions are worthless and your skills are garbage.
---
This is hyperbole (obviously), but the amount of hate for people that are still enjoying the game is quite toxic.
---
Spent two hours finishing Arah yesterday with pugs for the achievement, finished twenty minutes before reset. Salted me right up.
---
While, yes, we didn't know what we were doing back then the difficulty was still something else back then.
---
At that time my guild and I had all level 80 gear but there were AoEs that killed Zojja in 2 hits in the story mode.
---
That scaled down in the first year after release because most just couldn't do it. AC was even worse.
---
Looking forward to this.  Assuming no hick ups, glad they are able to hit the two month release instead of 3+.
---
The prologue was light and fluffy, of course that was to be expected for being a prologue.  It was well done for a festival like instance.  I hope we get a bit more meat to this one and more combat in out story missions.
---
Build templates in gw1 only handled skills and attributes. Gw2 templates can handle infinitely many skills and traits with notepad (or one of the other add-on programs) for free as well.
---
GW2 templates are far more complicated than GW1. GW1 templates did nothing to manage your inventory. That's why you pay for GW2 templates.
---
Well now I know you are trolling since Russia has the third highest suicide rate in the world.
---
MOP "journalism" in a nutshell for you
---
I'm a huge fan of Rev Hammer. Open World it's super fun, and later on you can viably bring that with very little adaptation to WvW. Easy build to bring into a large zerg and super easy to use.
---
What?? No, no, the mods made a stickied post declaring that they weren't going to do anything. That clearly counts as action.
---
Thanks.
---
Both of the first chapters are spoilery.  They each come with a prologue to begin that gives a lot of exposition to recap for people who might have missed the previous Living Story, and then launch into the first mission that is required to be completed for masteries.  If you turn off your volume and don't read the dialogue, you can get through the Path of Fire prologue easily enough, and then have another player help you with the first mission of Path of Fire, doing all the fighting for you while you hang back and again avoid all dialogue/etc.  After that you'll have the Raptor and be able to earn masteries.
---
Mon Quay
---
A lot of gw2 players just come here to see stuff that makes them happy and smile. They dont want to think, discuss or see anything else. This was the dominant hivemind on this sub for years. Almost all content was feel happy fluff, repeated daily for years.
---
MOST of them just upvote their interests. That's how reddit ideally works. However, a select group was aggressively downvoting anything they dont want to see. That's against rettiquette but again has been standard here for years.
---
To get any traction at all, you need enough popularity to get past this downvoting group. This is unhealthy for a subreddit, but it allows this small toxic group to ensure mainly their preferred content goes through.
---
This makes discussions as a whole impossible. The only way something gets traction is if it appeals to a wide group of players, which means mostly generalizing statements, memes and jokes. That's exactly what you see on big polarized subs and here. 
---
E.g : "Build templates bad" resonates with more people than "build templates bad because I use more than 6 builds."
---
Over time, nuanced opinions become more polarised because of this. I'd say the results speak for themselves. 
---
This sub may have been an artificial beacon of positivity in the past, but it was never ever inclusive towards pvp and wvw on the same level as pve. It was never a good place for discussions especially with regards to builds. It was just a fluff spam Instagram feed for casuals.
---
Cause there is no room to discuss any pve builds in most cases.
---
The meta builds are pretty clear and off-meta builds are just bad without having any advantages usually.
---
There is a new build worth discussing maybe once year, and even then you're better of dicussing stuff like that in discords.
---
Funny thing is, the BuildPad addon for arc can not only filter builds based on the class of your current character, but also lets you specify several flags for each stored build and allows you to filter your builds by these same flags (pve/wvw/pvp/power/condi/open world/dungeons/raids/etc).
---
So yeah... it's not the spaghetti code, they simply did a terrible job.
---
Same problem. Is your ISP SFR by any chance? ;)
---
What? I mean raids DO take some outside coordination, and you should have an optimal  fractal group, but the majority of players don't raid (sorry to say) because they have garbage rewards for the amount of work put into it. Furthermore unless you're fractaling in the middle of the work day or right before reset, you can pretty reliably get a group.
---
\^ This, a hundred times over. I'm not sure if we ever get wardobe updates again, but this would bring so much more value to outfits.  
---
I'd like to combine a simple cowl with heavy armor, for example the Primal Dervish Outfit's cowl with something like the Dolyak armor or Stag armor, but it's just not possible because of limitations.
---
I remember it even was a bit more like this - I still have screenshots from a combination of the Fancy Winter Outfit with the Top Hat... long ago, when the wardrobe was still separated into armor skins and town clothes.
---
If I buy Path of Fire from an Official Retair I will be 100% sure to get the Heart of Thorns expansion too? I know that the Arenanet site says I'll get Heart of Thorns for free, but the site of the official retailer here in Brazil (Nuuvem) don't say anything about it. Some other sites even sell HoT by itself, so that is what makes me confused.
---
I really, really want to buy the expansion PoF and get HoT, but I don't want to be surprised by buying PoF and not getting the other expansion too... :'(
---
Mine's busy saving up for the templates and I only need 5 raid ones and one for wvw, it'll be sad
---
&gt; This mentality leads to a subreddit with memes and trash and nothing else.

satisfy you. Or consider joining guilds and discords that provide actual quality content to metabattle, snowcrows etc. build sites by wading through the tedious discussions and contribute there, or follow guilds and youtubers who still do this. *This is the main subreddit of the game, and it welcomes new, relevant, pre-discussed, well-presented information for its players.*
---
In other words: yes, nobody cares about discussing these things in this 7 year old game that is mostly designed for and targeted at casual players, people come here to either receive links to readied answers, have **fun** or vent about hot issues. The rest is either done elsewhere in smaller communities, or not done at all because no one cares.
---
That doesn't look good for Almorra, I think the beef she had with Bangar was just the beginning... of the end.
---
FYI, SFR also has issues with Dofus and Fortnite servers atm. So my guess is that we have a shared root cause.
---
Coordination, but it took a few tries. We knew it would move if we got it to 10% each time so we would keep it aggroed with low damage until the other person was ready at the next spot .
---
Ehy though? Whats wrong with this sub? Why is my comment at -3?
---
I play mostly pvp games, but I see a lot more game knowledge and strategy being discussed in other games and subs. Obviously memes / plays / news is bigger but you'll see posts discussing strategies still have good upvote percent and discussion. Not here tho.
---
Put that stuff in your next key-farm-characters inventory before you delete it. --&gt; Poof, all of that annoying stuff is gone. Pure magic.
---
Do you have a link to that post?

I was out of town Thursday thru Sunday so I'm just getting back to my normal routine and gw2 today.

You know that 500 hours is akin to 20 days right? You're trying to say you've done all of this within that timeframe. It's physically impossible and you've made yourself out to be nothing but a troll according to your post history. gg
---
Why are you still here then?
---
You should take your own advice and " spend your time elsewhere'.
---
Why wasn't it even allowed by rule? That sounds ridiculous.
---
he also hates kids (not in that way) and loves kids (in that way), and faked his death. idk if thats mentioned on google.
---
Low effort
---
What is the main sub even for then if you can't discuss the actual game? Never seen any game have a different sub for something like builds.
---
Templates, if anything, are a step back from the existing system because you don't automatically change skills when entering pvp and wvw.  It's literally worse than nothing unless I spend $20 or more*per character*.  And even then it's bad
---
No the mods made a post saying they wont take them down because certain users dont only downvote every post they dislike but also report all of them. 
---
And mods have to deal with these carebears being butthurt 24/7. So they made a post that nicely says "stop being not butthurt and let people discuss templates, even if they are unhappy"
---
Fair enough. I think I'll do it properly than. Finishing Personal Story and S2 before going into HoT and unlocking Masteries.
---
Thanks!
---
One I don't think Anet are going to do a new game for a couple of years because GW2 suffered with devs being siphoned from the game. However I do think they could start building up through hiring new devs a separate division for new games over then next couple of years which means they don't need to take any devs off GW2 which as much as people may not want to admit it is Anet main source of income and they need to have all hands on that. So I do think we will get a new game from Anet but as part of a separate newly hired team and not from GW2.
---
Oh, thank you man. This kinda of proves something I was suspecting.
---
Here in Brazil a company called "Level Up" is kinda of responsible for Guild Wars 2. 
---
When you go to their site, they direct you to a store in order to buy the expansions, and this store don't say anything about gaining HoT for free when buying PoF, they also sell HoT separetly. This looks like a scam to me, what do you think?
---
Even wow classic, replaying a game that has been "solved" before its release has more strategy discussion than this sub. 
---
"Druid tanks are legit at all levels of play" is a post I saw pass by from wow classic. They discuss stuff. Posts like that do not exist here. The closest things were qt or sc benchmarks in the past.
---
That said I fully agree that people will ignore rules. I also think it gets worse as subs get bigger. That said, its exceptionally bad on this sub..considering how it has been promoted historically it's not surprising.
---
As frustrating as this is, that is a heartwarming example of community bonding together over some Anet BS lol
---
what has this to do with gameplay posts being downvoted?
---
funko pops tho
---
You're the edgelord mate.
---
I have plenty of criticisms of Anet, I just try not to be a moron about it.
---
if Orr is for necros, what is theif ranger and mesmer ends?
---
Because GW2 is a casual game and classic is not, there is a lot more depth to be discussed for classic and there are a lot more people who cares about it.
---
That might be a scam!  Or simply something outdated, if we want to presume innocence.  But yeah, Heart of Thorns shouldn't be sold separately anymore, so definitely don't buy it there.  Buying Path of Fire is enough to get you Heart of Thorns for free, and as I said before, if some sort of glitch in the system prevents that, support will assist you and fix it for free.
---
im okay with it tbh
---
kinda related the kid who has her uncles magic sword could have Magdaer and would be interesting to see her all grown up in this season with it.
---
Don't worry, be happy! Relax, let it go! Adjust, be flexible! Then everything is fine...
---
Gvg discussions get turned into matchup threads or also removed for "being matchup threads" even if you dont mention servers the moment carebears report them.
---
Cant discuss fights between servers obviously. Cant call out people on fighting bad players or using bad builds. I've had the post "generally people that man siege arent the best pvp players" removed because it was offensive. 
---
Idk what you want me to say. Yes the official forums are worse than this place and the mods are batshit crazy?
---
I'm not even gonna click. That the Reliant video right? *Clarkson falls sideways 20 secs in*
---
&gt;Every good game has things that are mediocre.

Most shit ones do too. Hence gw2

&gt;GW2 is a great game
---
Nope
---
&gt;content and replayability
---
Hahahahaahhaha sorry wait no you were serious?
---
There's been no new repayable content added to the game since HoT. Which is why pof maps are empty but hot metas are still packed.
---
But you know how it is with 4 year old content. It's stale af.
---
&gt;There are few games that you can get thousands of hours out of for the price of GW2.
---
Terraria costs a fiver these days.

&gt;The value is absolutely insane.

Yeah... I'm going to say no to that.

"This is great!": ArcDPS templates

"But I like this": Official templates
---
Dual Pistol builds work generally too well of the skill involved. Until they don't because the enemy brought reflects or projectile blocks that can't be stopped with Basilisk Venom.  
---
Then again, thieves can run away pretty easily, so they won't lose fights anyways, and can just return while the reflects are recharging if the enemy didn't clear away, so it will still work too well on average.  
---
Unload would be better if it was an ammo skill with 4 charges and 10s ammo recharge (15s in PvP/WvW), that recharges all ammo at the same time rather than one by one, and with a reduced initiative cost of 3 (5 in PvP/WvW).    
---
That would keep bad thieves from falling into the "pewpewpew" trap and actually use the autoattack and the other skills once in a while other than very rarely #2 to keep them from escaping and #4 to keep them from healing if they endured the entire pew pew spam.
---
They want us to do the marketing for them but wont even provide recruit-a-friend rewards
---
They're known for being extremely awful at marketing.
---
Feels quiinzos man
---
It’s a lil bit of a deeper issue. They put all these cash grabs in, but the money does not go towards anything that needs it. We don’t need 4 more lws maps, we need them to fix/update pvp, wvw, raids etc etc. If you wanna expand to countless of templates that exceed a normal player’s need, yeah fine if they make you pay a little. I am not against them asking for extra on certain convenience items. HOWEVER if they are gonna take our money, they could at least put it somewhere worthwhile. That being said, templates should have been here ages ago, and the fact that it took them 7 years they could have at least given a good amount for free. So no, it is definitely not fine. They need to learn to actually reward loyalty with something worthwhile, especially if they have not been doing the most.
---
You left before HoT, yet remained on the subreddit and somehow not know what's been going on?
---
Interesting how you stayed subbed here when your account was made on October 9th of this year.
---
At least from a raiding perspective (which is what I'm personally into MMORPGs for), it kinda does.
---
**RANGER** is the second class with most skills.
---
- All pet skills (3 unique per pet family - tons of families)
---
- Pet beast skills (1 unique per pet - tons of pets)
---
- Soulbeast pet family skills
---
- Soulbeast archetype skills (5 archetype)
---
- Glyphs act as 2 different skills each
---
Must explain why there is no marketing pushes then
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2 has freaking zero. And we are in the middle of a new Living Season.

Classic, isn't it?

Need a bit more context on what you're looking for when you say "more spells". 
---
Long range caster class? Staff/Greatsword Mesmer or Staff Necro
---
Class with a lot of different skills? Engineer, but they use gadgets instead of spells
---
As far as fun to play, each class has different perks that make them unique and fun, so it will really depend on your preferred playstyle. What is it about ele that's boring you currently or that you'd like to avoid?

You mean, shit i get for free in other MMO?

Aggressive monetization isn't really a flaw of the system. It also goes beyond just limited functionality. At it's core (as has been pointed out to me more recently) is that these aren't even templates when you get down to it. So there are quite a few crucial flaws.
---
It's true that ARC was free, 3rd party programs are always free. And you are right that they system gives us nothing for free other than that they are now supported for better or worse in game rather than use are your own risk. 
---
Unfortunately what people seem to miss is that WPs response to almost all things on the gem store and general pricing (see mount skins ) is that you can gold to gem. While I don't agree with that mindset that has always been his mindset regardless of how much gold he has, or how much gold he has or hasn't been giving. (some of which is vastly over estimated)
---
While that might be a poor excuse it's consistent in his general thinking. 
---
As for internet whining: It's often incorrect to blanket a community or a statement like this (I make this mistake myself all the time, I am trying not to). As I've said before, a lot of it was simple whining. Some of it was not. There are some good and valid points to make (as you've outlined here) as to why the system is problematic and wasn't ready for release.
---
Ping hands out unusual rewards.
---
I don't know that you need to abandon min-maxing altogether but build variety probably falls victim pretty hard. 
---
Some people simply want a system where they can switch between a few builds, this will work for them. But if you were used to arcs system then this one will be woefully inadequate. And probably always will be.
---
Yes.
---
"Computer says no."
---
Learn the track by just pressing w so you know where the tight corners are, learn to drift.
---
Key points are you can't drift for about 3 seconds after pressing the boost button, and you need need to start drifting well before an actual corner. So you either need pre-built momentum or a long run up to boost before you start drifting. There's only a handful of turns which you need to drift too.
---
Ive always tried it with deadeye but i saw someone reccomend daredevil.
---
how are you drifts so clean i dont understnad the turning and so on mostly XD
---
If threads weren't downvoted, they would appear in search results.
---
The hard truth is that megathreads are very bad as they don't appear on search engines.
---
Happens to all game subreddits out there. All the gamers leave/take a break and only "furry-art" people left. Even Path of Exile sub with its insane game design is art corner mid-to-end-league.
---
I know that a 3 second stun is really long, but i was thinking more of boons. I can time a stun and then act accordingly, but quite often i get a boon from a skill/talent which only lasts 2 seconds, and then i have the problem to do the right thing to benefit from it. Especially in the heat of a battle with all the damage zones on the floor, constant dodging etc.
---
But i guess i really just need more practice to get more used to these situations :)
---
And GW2 = Action, other MMOs = RPG is on point. It seems that that's the difference i was looking to find out why i struggle with certain things.
---
Even back when they were 30s this was insane.
---
I don't disagree, but that's a fundamental failing of MMOs. Achievements/collections in GW2 are no different from quests in WoW.
---
It wasn't just dungeons either; Fire Ele was notorious at launch for being an extremely difficult world boss until they patched it. Entire zergs of players would get wiped due to the adds and fire tornadoes that it would spawn.
---
I'd argue that now is the best time for players to learn and get back into dungeons. The power creep of elite specs has drastically lowered the barrier of entry that used to exist pre-HoT, and it's so quick and easy to clear trash mobs now that I'd say it's easier to just roll over everything rather than try to employ the stealth/skip strats that we used to have to use back in the olden days.
---
Im not familiar with wvw, but from what ive heard the servers discords are very strict on what you run
---
that 500 trash elite mobz tho.
---
Until they fix the scourge shroud nonsense pvp is kind of dead to me. They should at the very least add a 120 radius around the scourge when a shade is out to give them the barrier buffs but can still be in trouble if they decide to just roll into people and smash f2-f5. They could even give a shade cancel skill, sort of like the weaver to juke people.
---
I hate Lupi. He's easy if you have his mechanic down and get reflection skills to reflect his projectiles
---
It's worth noting that building your character for boon duration is a possible choice you can make. You won't find much to help with that before level 80, but you can get boon duration up to +100% if you build for it. Some skills in the game can extend the duration of boons that are currently on you too. Both of those are reasons why some boons are really short by default.
---
I'd be happy to give some targeted advice if you give me a specific skill you're struggling with. 🙂
---
Well yeah, when people don't care about a discussion and and don't think it has value on the front page, they downvote it.
---
Just want to add on, as a casual player who really just enjoys dicking around in the game, doing stuff without real objectives, and generally messing around with friends, build and item templates have enabled me to do so much more.
---
"Credit" as in your steam wallet or your amazon account (gift cards). 1$ paid equals 1$ in the store.
---
Credit is listed in a regulated legitimate currency such as the Dollar or the Euro. These tie them to a degree of value not dictated and fluctuates based on the game makers whim such as gems do.
---
Conversely, if you feel like the game developers aren't developing the game in your interest, you probably aren't their target audience and your part of the conversation is irrelevant to them, and being able to post comments on reddit anyway does not reinstate your relevance.
---
I’m the commander of the Pact, and I don’t have time to answer such questions.  Unless you have a 💛 over your head, in which case I’ll be happy to help.  Maybe.
---
The difference is entirely psychological. People have less the impression of 'spending money' when it's disguised into an artificial currency. I mean we do get a price if we buy gems directly but without any proper price tags on items you buy, I assume it lessen the impact for many?
---
About tight corner drifts, if you end your drift while you have the side key (let's say D in case you drift right) and your forward key (w) released you'll end up turning really tight at the exact moment you release the drift key
---
However you might go too much on the side and lose momentum, quickly release d key and press w again
---
I don't know if a better drift in method exists but this one is good enough for this race
---
Anti-rage medication and a massage chair
---
Yes, I'll ask a friend of mine who works at Anet to add it specially for you!
---
r/gw2exchange
---
the problem is that if you saw real world prices like this (which i love) then you would, if you had any sense, run away every time. so instead they disguise it with a fake currency with a different value-dollar-gem-gold price to convalute/obfuscate the actual cost.
---
What are those irrelevant numbers you're showing me? They don't look anything like gold coins.
---
this is literally straight out of guild wars.. what are you on about lol
---
This... this is actually brilliant, and I can't believe I never thought of this!  Thank you, random Internet person, for this wonderful suggestion!
---
It doesnt matter if you pay for gold or money. Paying by gold means someone else paid money for it.
---
But that would be rmt (/s?)
---
Well I agree to that..
---
I can just imagine the music from around the Faren flyer waypoint in verdant brink.
---
Industry standard, qq more
---
Imagine how much better the game could've been if there wasn't gold to gems exchange or if it had sub instead of this garbage mtx store.
---
&gt; they disguise it with a fake currency with a different value-dollar-gem-gold price to convalute/obfuscate the actual cost.
---
...and to actually make it possible to buy items for in-game currency instead of cash.
---
Nbd, PvP is garbage anyway, and now confirmed to be full of hackers, which was something everybody already knew, but now there’s been another ban wave. 
---
The only reason to even do PvP is to get rewards and since you get pips/reward path progress whether you win or lose, a lot of players just bullshit their way through it or AFK mid match, so either you end up on a garbage team, or you’re playing against a garbage team, either way, no reason to ever take it seriously. That’s why it could never be an Esport, even if Anet was totally down for it. Nevermind the balance issues, which cause everybody to play one or two specs, calling that the meta and calling anybody who deviates a scrub.
---
Lol why would one class being out of the meta for once in three years make pvp "dead to you."
---
Yeah, that's the same reason why you never see adverts for Coke.
---
It also means you pay more. Want a 600 gem item? You have to buy 800 and spend more cash than you wanted to. Something on sale for 200? Still gotta buy 800.
---
&gt; or if it had sub
---
Yeah, better for that 10% of the population that'd be left playing.
---
Doesn't World of Warcraft's in-game shop show in USD?
---
I know exactly what I'm paying when I buy gems. Its not hard to math, it's right there!
---
Play it because it's fun?
---
Dagos did mention humanoid, and Endless Olmakhan Tonic is actually an Sand Effigy ( https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elite_Olmakhan_Sand_Effigy ) so  the name of the tonic is a bit misleading. here the tonic vs my charr main https://imgur.com/a/Ag4EcTW
---
Or just quit MMOs altogether, nobody cares about them any more because all the kids wanna play these days are battle royales. MMOs aren’t trendy any more.
---
They’ll probably make a comeback eventually, but right now MMOs suck.
---
they were 80c when this recipe was introduced
---
&gt; I really like my build and how I play it, am I wrong?
---
No. Most often when people talk about "you should blah" builds, they're talking about raids and T4 fractals. If you don't care about those, do what you enjoy. 
---
If you *do* want to get into them, condi firebrand is pretty strong, even better if you get a bit of boon duration to play "quickbrand" because everyone loves quickness. In open world stuff, dungeons and T1/T2 fractals, you're fine with sword/shield. 
---
&gt; I opened 1000 trick or treat bags and got a very nice fire sword but now I want to get the shield, this means, get another weapon box from Mad King, how do I do that? Do I need another 1k bags?
---
I believe the achievement is not repeatable, so it's a one-and-done affair. However, the coffers can be bought and sold on the trading post for about 75g. 
---
Otherwise, keep opening the trick of treat bags and hope for a random drop...
---
Guardian is fine.  Sword/Shield and Greatsword w/Berserker stats is fine.  Firebrand with condis and Scepter is fine too, but you don't need to go specifically to that.
---
With that said, you might still want to consider trying out Dragonhunter and/or Firebrand.  You can keep your chosen weapons, but the elite specializations each offer you a lot of things.  Dragonhunter is now packed with a lot of damage modifiers, including the very hefty +20% damage against enemies you activate Virtue of Justice against, which combos extremely well with the trait that recharges Virtue of Justice whenever you kill something.  Firebrand has less damage-boosting traits, but you get the very useful Mantra skills which have low recharges and give you easy, shareable sources of Aegis, Quickness, Stability and condition cleanses, depending on which ones you equip.  Firebrand also turns your Virtues into equippable kits that have potent effects while in use, much more than the core "activate F3 for group Aegis", which Firebrand bakes into its multi-charge heal skill as is.
---
I'd say you should at least take looks at those specializations.  You won't need new equipment to test them out.  You don't have to use a Longbow when playing as a Dragonhunter, or an Axe when playing as a Firebrand.  Even if you like your current build, you might still enjoy the options the elite specs can provide you with, and want to use them occasionally as a result!
---
As for the fire sword, opening another 1000 bags won't get you another one, unless you're exceptionally lucky to get it as a normal drop.  The "get a weapon guaranteed for 1000 bags" is a one time achievement reward.  If you want to guarantee that you can get another, your only option is to buy the weapon box from the Trading Post, where other people are selling the ones they get (be they the ones from opening 1000 bags, or ones they actually got via lucky drops).
---
Yeah this sub has gotten stupid over the last couple years. Now it's mostly memes, when before whatever changed changed, memes were considered low effort trash like they should be and got cleaned up.
---
I have only paid real money into gems a couple times and not because I wanted why cosmetic or so, just because I was having a real fun with the game and wanted to support (10€ each time, I am not a whale).
---
 All the time I've been using the gold into gem conversion because the cosmetics in there feel like an inferior version of something obtained in the real game and the QoL features can be obtained along time using gold.
---
i think thats something casuals use because they dont know how to farm gold, or maybe are new to the game
---
see my imgur image then you see that the tonic are more bent than a charr
---
At the very least, they could have let 20 USD/€ equal 2000 gems for transparency, not 1600.
---
Gems are a separate tradeable currency with separate spread and rates that are influenced by both real-world and in-game transactions as well as ANet's internal taxation policy. Removing gems as a currency, even if at all possible, would make the experience very confusing and simply... unappealing from the experience point of view. Gems act as a gateway between the real world and imaginary world, and are a one-way asset around which players can plan their investments.
---
I mean I've never bought gems, and still have every gem store item I want, with lots of cash to spare. If you play the game and denote a bit of time to making money in it (not just grinding) buying what you want is no reason to whip out your credit card. Will people do just that? For sure. Will I? No thanks. Do you need to? Absolutely not. Gold to gems means you can get what you want without paying money, having the option just gives people a fast track, and since things are not necessary for gameplay (even if a lounge and the copper-fed salvage-o-matic are near essential), the game is still fun without spending a penny.
---
I always convert the value for real money first every time I'm tempted. Until today that conversion have saved me a lot of money because never saw something that worth that much money. I just use the money to buy something on sale on steam and never regret it. A full game for the price of a skin that I will use a month until another skin arrives!
---
Can you do the same with gold instead of gems or dollar?
---
You might, but not everyone does.
---
That's literally why most games use premium currencies instead of "cash" values. It's a tried and true marketing ploy, which 100% works.
---
The comments here explaining why templates are bad and people are wrong for criticizing them are only proving the point of the joke.
---
Anet didn't wanna police the trash talk. Every matchup thread devolved into trash talk no matter what. That's why in a nutshell.
---
&gt; Something on sale for 200? Still gotta buy 800.
---
Something on sale for 200? Convert them from those measly 70 gold.
---
I dont see how this is a really bad example. Isnt the point of learning getting better than you currently are at something? Thus gaining a increased level of mastery over/of said thing?
---
You can't legally exchange an in-game currency for real money, even if it's only listed as "credit".
---
And they use many of the same pricing tactics, their subreddit is having a lot of outrage recently over changes to the cash shop that really pushed cash sales.
---
Combination of legality and psychology.
---
You could still have a system where you buy $10 worth of credits for $10.
---
it would lose at least half of its population , wow and ff14 are the only games with sub fees that would count as successful, how many others went f2p or b2p, and gw2 would happen the same because gw1 was b2p and the community would never allow for gw2 to go sub model 
---
and the subject with better game is not money related its about the people working on the game , still same management and same devs. i think swotr is best example how you can spend alot of money and stil fail spectacular
---
I am pretty sure they are saving their budget for their next marketing partnership with Sears or something - Buy a smart refrigerator, get an 8-slot bag.
---
... no?  The government only gets involved if you're trading for what is actually real dollars, that you can take out of the game's ecosystem and use in the real world.
---
Ehh, it really depends on your play style. I've played pretty regularly for 4 years now, with only small breaks here and there. I tend to be an achievement hunter though, so when I find myself getting bored I simply pick a new goal (make a new legendary, complete a collection, pick a chapter/episode and try to get all the story achievements, etc). If that's not your thing, having a good guild is also a great way to give the game longevity. There are plenty of guilds who organize their own guild events and activities, or even host community-wide events.
---
I take unpopular over incorrect every day, sir.
---
I'm not a legal expert but when it comes to converting a fake currency for what appears as real money, I do know that there are certain laws that apply. The extra layer of premium currency helps to mitigate that.
---
&gt; TIL paying for cosmetics is more important than pay2win lmao. This is the most ~~gw2reddit~~ thing i've ever read.
---
incorrect, this is a **proper Microtransactions Implementation in a video game**. ANY p2w MTX should be forbidden in a game, because then it isn't a (skill)game. You can p2w in the real world there is no reason to translate that to a multiplayer game, but cosmetics allow you to show off your real world wealth(the same reason for p2w) without ruining the game for anyone else. 
---
This includes time based mechanics, most of those are poorly made in order to promote monetization (not game play) should be scrapped. Originally Facebook games were made with the target of intermittent 10 min play times(average time people spend on a break and check Facebook) and the games reflected that goal. Original WoW and the rested XP is the same thing, they decided on a target playtime(for one reason or another, player health is one mentioned) and made a restriction around it. Greed then made companies see they could make those times longer and then charge people to reduce them. 
---
Designing a feature based on how much you can make off it vs how well it affects game play is the absolute worst form of Game Design(exception, gambling games, the only place it is allowed because they return money, not that they are well designed games though).
---
Nah we're hanging from a tree somewhere in the background. With a rope around our neck.
---
Interesting.
---
And thanks for the offer, but it's not a specific skill, it's the overall system ;)
---
It really comes down to practice, practice, practice :D
---
It has to be clear that the "credit" is _not_ real money. If it appears as real money, then it's a potential issue, even if you can't pull it out to use IRL.
---
xD Litty
---
I mean, the "Prologue" was basically Episode 1 in all but name.
---
It's true that they might get customers who don't read the rules complaining that they *thought* it was real money, but that's a far cry from legal issues and the government getting involved.
---
I have a quick question regarding buying gold, gems, etc. In regards to crafting the best gear in the game....someone can just buy gold and then buy all the materials required to max out crafting to craft the best gear? Or do you still gotta do stuff in game?
---
Basically trying to figure out if this game is pay to win as far as buying gold to max out crafting and then crafting the best gear?
---
Nah. One of GW1's main draws is it didn't have a sub fee, and GW2 is the same. It's a completely different feeling, playing a game without a sub fee. No need to figure out if I'm going to have the free time this month to bother keeping the sub active. No need to plan around other games coming out that might take too much GW2 time. If I play it, great. If I don't, fine. 
---
It's more than the business model (though the business model of a sub fee would infect every part of the game as well; you think account-bound time-gated materials are bad now, imagine if they could literally get more money out of you by making you wait longer to get what you want). It's how the game exists in my gaming diet. That's irreplaceable, and you bet your ass that the game would have not done as well if it had tried to compete with other sub fee MMOs.
---
GW2 is not WoW or FFXIV. It's never going to be a no-lifer type of MMO experience. They know that, that's why they keep  "pandering to casuals" and development on more hardcore modes like raids and WvW gets de-prioritized. You're asking for a different game, and there are tons of those games out there already.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; That's literally why most games use premium currencies instead of "cash" values. 
---
They won't understand. Even if you link [250 pages long papers](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=10&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj72_qkndHlAhUGEBQKHbfpDtQQFjAJegQIABAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ftc.gov%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2Fpublic_events%2F1511966%2Fslides-loot-box-8-7-19.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2uHtghPRjfBE49LQWxMl7D) (link to download of a pdf) that go in depth.

Right?  I mean worst case you just go letter by letter.  Imagine taking time to do this and not thinking.  I get missing letters but come on!  Theres ways to not take 30 minutes on something like this.

Condi firebrand intensifies
---
I love how every answer is "We've had these questions before". Meanwhile the state of the sub is: "This is why templates (akshually loadouuuuuts) are bad, here is my vision on how it should be: [the exact same 'vision' as the 18 other posts on front page]".
---
Ok.
---
Was about to post the same. So easy, so efficient.
---
Just because you feel important doesn't mean this adds up to a "vast majority". In fact, the vast majority of people playing the game didn't get any benefit - or even less.
---
Because your charr has his weapons stowed....
---
Unequip the weapons and it will take the shaman stance.
---
I feel like with other matters WP always stayed "neutral". I remember him agreeing with the fact that mounts were kinda expensive. But he also said it came as no surprise to him because Anet had been slowly but surely pushing the boundaries of the gem store for the last couple years. Dont want to delve too much into this, but when someone states something clearly against what is actually going on it has to be pointed out.
---
This video however he seems to try and ease out the anger from the community for some reason I'm not really sure off. Being okay with this system is not okay. If we had taken this approach with other matters in the past such as the lootboxes from mount skins (all the "whining" gave us the mount contracts and smaller pools of skins, from 30 a box to 15 a box) or full armor sets being sold on the gemstore, or hell, pvp/wvw balance etc etc then we would never move forward.
---
Internet always likes to make big drama and yes that is detrimental to the state of the community, but sometimes it is also efficient to get word across.
---
The steam marketplace has been operating for years, and I've never heard of any legal issues like that.  It's possible there may have been some cases that flew under the radar, but I'd expect it to be all over gaming news sites if it happened.
---
would you link it here?
---
Their money spends better on me.
---
All of these prices are perfectly reasonable. GW2 doesn't have a sub fee.
---
he used to do that, but then he changed, he changed  lot, he started his master quest and now beg for them and keys. And try to make it look ok by making it a "community" afford. Yes he want to unlock everything for himself as say its a cool community goal...
---
It's a dumb person tax.
---
The candy corn gobbler can be considered one of the top if not the best gemstore item!
---
Right? There’s one not that far from my house and not all that old, yet it still looks super dumpy. I think it’s a dying breed.
---
J can't beleive they finally made us pay for subs
---
Why would anyone even consider eating that?
---
&gt;  There is no winning the discussion with scientific methods, because people who defend MTX are scientifically illiterate. Sorry.
---
Lmfao
---
"Hm, this game I enjoy playing doesn't have a sub fee. This means that when I want something nice from the cash shop, I can buy that whenever to balance things out. I really enjoy this husky mount and think I'll purchas-"
---
"WHY DO YOU HATE SCIENCE"
---
This is the bubble tea thing all over again.
---
Wow....completely missing the fucking obvious. 
---
You just listed a bunch of subscription based games compared to a Free2play one which btw you are all bitching about microtransactions for the past week. 
---
Absolute morons, they have a smaller budget and less money to splash around.
---
Anyone who gets "manipulated" by not being able to do simple math on RNG probability from lootboxes is just paying a stupid tax.
---
Been asking for more hairstyles fo years, and there's barely been any added.
---
This is such a bullshit argument.  A sub fee in most games is between $10 and $15 a month.  If you maxxed out even a single character with max templates it would cost you almost as much as 3 months of a sub fee.  That's just a single character with a single feature.  Meanwhile, sub fee games have tons of in game earnable cosmetics and in game systems that aren't gimped in order to milk the consumers.
---
It's people like you that are causing the gaming industry to become a MTX infested shithole since you reward predatory and anti-consumer practices like these microtransactions.
---
&gt; edit: Just watch this garbage.
---
I won't watch it because I'd have to go to the gym afterwards to calm down...
---
&gt;  if you don't notice any difference from your typical gameplay as a result of the templates update,
---
Or you have 70+ characters as your stand-in for build templates.
---
You're a prime example of what I just said.
---
I don't need templates. I would however need to pay a sub fee to play Guild Wars 2 at all if it had one.
---
Someone needs to make an addon that does this.
---
diablo 3 had real world money trading in the auction house for a while, but scammers were taking out too much money out of it, possibly by duping expensive gear and profiting, so they removed it.
---
If I remember right CTRL + click pings it into the chat but doesn't send it. Can then copy the string (CTRL + A to make this easier), paste it and remove the brackets.
---
Yeah I'm sure that the random redditor knows this better than the professionals at NCsoft or Anet. They made the game b2p because they estimated that brings more revenue.
---
Once great and praised GW model become a pay to pay abomination.
---
&gt; People doesn't seem to understand that even if GW2 would have lose some players the playerbase would eventually even out.
---
Oh, they understand that's what you're saying.
---
They don't agree. 
---
And you have no basis on which to proclaim that the game would have had "more budget" to make the game, especially since in your scenario you freely admit that there would have been fewer people playing the game, which means fewer subscriptions. There is no data that you can turn to to prove your assertion that the game would have had more funding with a subscription fee in the long run, but I (and others) can confidently point to our own experiences and preferences and say that *we wouldn't be here* if it did have one from the start.
---
But the obvious solution of having two purchase-buttons, one in € and one in gold, wouldn't make them enough income~! Won't anyone think of the poor, poor, managers?!
---
Raising the TP limit doesnt increase the supply of gold in the game by one copper. If anything, it decreases by extracting even larger TP transaction taxes. So, now that I just eviscerated your argument, I presume you now agree with me?
---
Not obfuscating is nice for the customer.
---
Tho, to be honest, while i'm scared when i see useless package at 25$, the build template expansion seems more appealing in $$$ than in gems. That psychological "less than 5" instead of "some hundreds of".
---
Diablo 3 allowed buying with real world currency, yes. But in GW2 said currency would/could be locked to the account, or even restricted (due to the account being banned).
---
Spending money for items isn't an issue, getting access to your money itself restricted would be.
---
The fact that dungeons are soloable is excellent in my opinion.  You can choose the difficulty at which you would like to play the content.  Solo, duo, etc, up to 5 man.  Even 5 man runs varys based on the skill of the party.
---
Man, I really wish some people just didn't have money lol.
---
Alright thank you I will be trying out the game as a thief soon
---
I have never seen this appropriation before of comparing gw2 to mobile games but it really makes sense. Ascended gear is crafted from materials that have daily time gates. These materials can be purchased, effectively bypassing the gate, with in-game currency. In-game currency can be purchased with real currency. By the transitive property, real money spent means time saved in game = mobile games in a nutshell.
---
It's that fabled optional sub I've seen people asking for.
---
Pink/blue icebrood ogre ? damn this looks ugly, and since it is a minipet, I guess we will see it in game
---
&gt;Especially when you have more budget to develop the game.
---
That budget might be better used on some other project.
---
Gee that package would be nice. Pity I live in Aus. This kind of thing really makes me mad, exclusive game content that many people have 0 chance to obtain.
---
&gt;You might, but not everyone does.
---
I don't like MTX but what is this supposed to mean? If you buy gems with 10€ to get something from the gem store you spend 10€, I don't see what's so confusing here.
---
Why are so many dumb white knight avocados downvoting this? It's the truth. Whether you like it or not.
---
\*monkey paw finger curls\*
---
hope you like quiznos
---
You have literally no idea what you're talking about and probably didn't even read the actual studies you just linked.
---
I'm a consumer. I would like to buy a cosmetic husky mount, because it looks nice. I spend money on it. 
---
1) People's perception of me and my mount is overall irrelevant to the satisfaction I feel in my purchase. I like my husky mount.
---
2) The study clearly states that gamers are more fine with cosmetic purchases. In Guild Wars 2, you can't actually buy an advantage over players.
---
Lol
---
in diablo 3 i made just under $AU3 cash from selling an item in the auction house. but i imagine people made thousands cash in there.
---
They'll buy a few more taxi cabs soon, no worries!
---
&gt; including wasting time 
---
That's what I was referring to. Wasting time instead of enjoying the game.
---
If they made an actual subscription to play... I have a laundry list of things to check off before subbing, but if they did make those changes, I would be subbed for life. No more outfits. No more skins in blc chests. Fixed drop rates on infusions (so their max price is under 10k). Done. Full stop.
---
But, they're 2 years old by now. How **long** would you want to market them? And when do you need something new to market?
---
There's like a million other things Anet should focus on with their game than new hairstyles, as much as id like them.
---
Still nothing excuses bad marketing, like, launching a campaign partnering with a pretty much defunct enterprise...
---
Every RPG studio on the face of the Earth should be racing to back up a brinks truck to his house instead of blowing up his tweets.
---
Yes. This is called currency abstraction. Studies have indicated that the further you can abstract the idea of "money" away from purchases, the less likely a consumer is to consider how frequently and how much they are spending. 
---
Lots of games have multiple levels of abstraction. For example: Buy 200 dust for $0.99 &gt; convert 500 dust to a crystal &gt; convert 3 crystals to a diamond &gt; \*limited time exclusive item\* costs 5 diamonds. 
---
Now, here is the extra sneaky bit. Lots of games will advertise in-game ways to earn these currencies so you can grind them without spending real money. But that isn't what that is really for, it actually serves two monetization purposes. 
---
The first is to muddy up the direct dollar to currency conversion. For example, you can salvage duplicate items for 3 dust, you can earn one crystal chip once a week and it takes four chips to make a crystal or you can salvage the chip for 30 dust. Should a player buy a cash shop item after a few weeks, then it's hard for them to put an exact dollar value on the item.  Insert keys and RNG as additional layers of abstraction and you almost completely obfuscate the cost of an individual item.
---
The second is operant conditioning. Games will liberally dole out currencies for accomplishments early, and then reduce and finally withdraw them entirely. You are conditioned to receive those rewards at certain milestones so once you stop getting them then you are more compelled to just buy them to reward yourself.
---
Anet is not really thaaat bad here. They only have one layer of abstraction and that is probably for tax and currency conversion reasons. They do drop black lion chests frequently and keys very rarely after the free story key, but that isn't even as manipulative as it could be.
---
The worst game I have seen, by far, was Apex Legends. I am not sure of the state of it now, but when it launched it blatantly used every nasty MTX trick in the book with no shame about it whatsoever
---
Untill you realise that $5 is 10-20% of whole games.
---
Yeah, that's literally just a cup of coffee.
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
It is, and it's not the best system out there. It's very limited, and they don't really give you a whole bunch for free, and for people like me with many builds, it costs a lot of gold to get to a point where you can make proper use out of it. Even more if you use more classes than I do. They really should have done better all around.
---
That being said, a lot of this drama is general overreactions. People are making large stretches with "It's P2W" with hypothetical uses of the build system in WvW. The claim is you could bait classes with a build that one class could counter, than swapping to another that counters who you baited. I have yet to see this once (and I like live in WvW), and they fail to mention that if you are close enough to bait someone, they are close enough to hit you in the middle of your swap, getting you stuck halfway in the middle of your swap, making you useless. They also forget to mention that every single person can do this for free, without spending gold or gems, of this is how they wanted to play.
---
The game is in a weird spot for sure, but it's mostly community reactions to updates, and the pains from restructuring an entire company. 2019 was not the year for GW2, but things should be better in 2020 if Anet stays true with all their hype behind season 5. In the end, if you liked GW2 when PoF dropped, you'll still like it.
---
For the extremely short time I was in a pyramid scheme, about a month or so before I got out, they did the exact same thing. They claimed you had your "own online business" where you made a percentage of every sale. Instead of just showing you exactly how much money you made they had a point system to show "wow, you made a bunch of points from this sale!" when in reality if you calculated it out you would make pennies on $10-100 sales. This was all after having to pay annual member dues and monthly website fees, after which the vast majority of their "independent business owners" would lose lots of actual money, but instead see it as "gaining lots of points." I know it's not exactly the same thing, but it's similar in that points were used instead of real money to make people feel like their choices were more justified and hide how grim the reality of their actual decisions were.
---
I totally did a double-take (subs? Nooooo) It took me a moment to finally notice the sandwich.
---
Exactly. That's why Belgian laws have to be just the first step in game development for the future.
---
So ANet marketing team working for Quizno’s now?
---
Yeah, GW1 did and that was I agree with (and why this does generally suck so much.) 
---
FFXIV is a subscription is it not? So I wouldn’t call that free.
---
Control your beetle with your right click and use the direction  key along with the drift as it will turn faster. If you're going too fast use the backwards key to slow a bit down since it's better than going off track. If you've done a good run but can't make the last two turns you can cheese them with the raptor or jackal.

So it's okay for low intelligence people to pay "stupid tax" but I'm assuming you're not okay with people of color paying "racist tax", right?
---
To be logically consistent here you'd have to either: 
---
- Admit to being racist
---
- Admit that what you just wrote is stupid and you don't actually think it
---
- Prove to me that my previous paragraph is not a good comparison and why. Since they're both discrimination against minorities, I'm eager to see you do that.
---
You always react to papers like that? Cool, cool.
---
&gt;  They only have one layer of abstraction and that is probably for tax and currency conversion reasons
---
I've seen game devs list this as one of the reasons why many games that actually *did* use Real Money for their stores actually switch in favor of using a virtual currency instead. There are apparently a lot of laws that are a bit muddy when it comes to having Dollars sitting in an account instead of "Gems". It also affects how such assets are accounted for in their balance sheets.
---
If you make it clear that it is *not* real money, you basically get gems. That's exactly what they do. :)
---
&gt; This sub being really... passionate
---
We all know know its toxic. They want to circle jerk anything bad Anet does for months on end and mods let it happen. Instead of being a place to talk and come together the minority who have nothing but salt have ruined this sub.
---
Same result for me, crash with d912pxy
---
&gt;That's also 14% of the most standard gacha paiement.
---
Huh, I wasn't aware the most standard Gacha price is $35. I honestly would have thought it was $20 or $40.
---
I recently found that it wasn't that easy.
---
I created a Facebook page earlier to post my youtube videos as I created them so they wouldn't be put on Facebook under my real name.  Facebook immediately started pushing me to advertise my first post but I declined.  Then they approached me with a $15 credit, so I tossed $5 into the ring.  Facebook was estimating that I would reach up to 7000 people (which makes sense since currently Facebook is estimating I can reach between 1,200-3,500 people per day for $10/day spent).  
---
This is my experience with $20 of Facebook marketing and these are my results.  First, you have to define an audience.  My audience was people in Virginia from ages 24-65+ with the following interests: "Action role-playing game", "Final Fantasy", "Guild Wars", "Guild Wars 2", "MMO", "MMORPG", "Playing Computer Games", "The Elder Scrolls", "The Legend of Zelda", "World of Warcraft" and "Role Playing Games."
---
I elected to stretch my $20 for over 10 days.  I reached 3,093 people during that time.  Demographics were 19.1% Women and 80.9% Men, with a over 50% of the total audience reached being in the 25-34 age range.  37.1% of my ads were in the Facebook Marketplace on Mobile devices, 33.5% in Mobile in-stream Video, and 24% in Mobile News Feeds.  **This all led to $1.43 per click as I only received 14 clicks.**  My ad under-performed since the industry average is around 1% click-through-rate, and I was considerably under that.  I have no idea what I'm doing and actual marketing people understand psychology better than I do.
---
Anyways, it quickly dawned on me that other people use facebook just like I do -- they scroll past the advertisements.  What's weird is I can't even remember the last time I saw a Facebook ad, so I must be subconsciously ignoring them and skipping right past them.  I bet GuildWars2 would perform better because of the name recognition.  
---
So, sure, blasting ads to people is a good idea and I agree they should incorporate digital marketing into their portfolio, but I'm not really sure what the return would be.  They can advertise new Living World content but would that draw in new players?   The game is Free to Play, so even getting someone in the door doesn't necessarily translate into money.  The other games the OP mentioned have subscription fees so to play the game past the paltry demo period the company starts making money.  Not sure if it's cost effective in the long run.
---
On this subreddit, everything is downvoted. Be it defending anet or not.
---
I dislike how you hijacked his actual useful comment, to shit on his stupid comment from earlier.
---
Yeah, it's why it's an industry standard. Plus there's the psychological angle of it, which there are literally scholarly articles about.
---
did...snargle feed that guy to Slothasor?
---
Back in the day we used to just have our thief solo the capture circles with stealth
---
Then increase the drop rate and screw those people over... Anet has done that time and time again to other valued items. Wind Catcher was 700g and now it is worthless. Flaming great sword thing was almost at 2000g and now it is cheap. Increase the drop rate so more people can have them.
---
Why not just bundle PoF with season 4 and call it a mega-expansion, sell it for $10 more, since that's S4 it costs on the TP... It's a metric fuckton of content.
---
&gt;  Studies have indicated that the further you can abstract the idea of "money" away from purchases, the less likely a consumer is to consider how frequently and how much they are spending.

Can you pls link the studies so I can reference them in the future? I always take [this great study](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1846/184602.htm) from the UK parliament on lootboxes as a starting point. See further down the thread.

This sub is about sniffing farts about how amazing the community of the sub is.

This is why they do it. Put as many steps between spending your money and the final product as possible. So you forget what you've really paid.
---
You can just loot best gear from fractals, can buy it with daily login rewards (laurels) , you can buy it with tokens you get for playing raids, pvp, wvw. Crafting is actually the slowest way even if you would buy all the materials (and those materials actually rain on you in all gamemodes).
---
does any class have good mace skills outside of occasional CC (warrior) or defense/light heals (guardian)?
---
You're rambling. Everyone not using ArcDPS has gotten load-outs and bag space for free. And I don't even want to know what all of this has to do with me feeling important or not.
---
&gt; Lots of games have multiple levels of abstraction. For example: Buy 200 dust for $0.99 &gt; convert 500 dust to a crystal &gt; convert 3 crystals to a diamond &gt; *limited time exclusive item* costs 5 diamonds.
---
WTF? I would just skip that on the basis of a company making spending money a PITA. If you want money from me then you should make it as easy as possible.
---
So why is it possible to sell a WoW token for real currency balance on your Blizzard account?
---
In terms of being a consumer? Comfortably above-average since I round up with $X.99 items, research products, keep a luxury item budget, and keep probability in mind.
---
What is strange and likely a stupid move on Anet's part is: They don't give you any bonus gems for spending more money. That is game  monetization 101. It always baffled me that they didn't do this.

Probably the same reason you can sell things on the Steam Marketplace for real money. There are legal hoops you have to jump through that those companies, with their much, _much_ larger legal budget, have figured out.
---
Path of Exile does this and it is annoying as hell.  Most purchases will leave you with an extra 25-50 points ($2.50-$5.00) and to get more fake currency you can only buy in packages and not just another 25, 50, etc.
---
Take it casual.   
---
You don't need to speed through this course to get the achievement, you can take the corners with ease and just the the straightaways through the center for boosts. Panicking and trying to get through the course at 100% speed the whole time will lead you to fail. Don't walk your beetle, but if you find a part of the track tricky for you to maneuver, you can swap to jackal or raptor and run through those parts without losing much time.

[Personal Story](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/On_Red_Alert)
---
Part of a personal story step, the lighting is red because the player has tripped the security system, if I remember right.
---
&gt;People doesn't seem to understand that even if GW2 would have lose some players the playerbase would eventually even out. Especially when you have more budget to develop the game.
---
Yeah... Look how well that went for rift, swtor, eso, lotro, wildstar... FFXIV is the only one who managed to make its sub fee viable in the past decade. 
---
Gw2's b2p model was one of its best selling point at launch. I doubt they could have sustained a sub fee model.
---
TIL 500 hours of gameplay is a low bar
---
I am not arguing anything at this point, I just answered according to what is considered the meta place for PvE.
---
&gt;Just because PvE can be completed by darn near anything doesn't mean that certain builds are much better at it than others.
---
yes, you are explaining why there isn't an open world meta actually. Since it's so easy to complete open world there hasn't been the need for a meta to stablish so you are basically just repeating what I said with more words.
---
&gt; This is because you can change your understanding of probability, but you can't change your race.
---
You're implying people who fall prey to MTX don't understand probabilities, I'd bet many of them do.
---
You're also militating for people improving their personal ability to avoid scum, instead of militating against scum itself, which is counter-intuitive.
---
&gt; If you mean people who are literally mentally disabled with learning/developmental issues, then that's a very small minority of people who society can't afford to constantly cater to.
---
And yet most first world countries do? Sounds like you have very selfish/right-wing views, on which I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
---
&gt; MMOs in general are addictive even without microtransactions.
---
So is coffee? Do you wanna give your cash to Starbucks and not know what you're gonna get? Do you want Starbucks to implement premium currency? I don't think you do.
---
What I'm seeing here is a lot of non-arguments. Not a single thing you said implies MTX are good (only that they're not that bad, or only bad for a minority of people) and many things I said implies they're bad for many people.
---
And? Do you see all the actual Warframe Partners constantly sucking up to them? No.  
---
Meanwhile WP defends ANet through everything and acts like a jackass on his high horse whenever anyone goes against his opinion.
---
AAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!
---
Have you seen the new WoW expansion features video? That’s how you advertise your game. Anwt did that once and everyone liked it but then they stoppen and have more leggings stuff.
---
Almost like there should be some sort of role of community leader, who could, I dunno, *moderate* these tendencies through leadership and judicious use of their powers...
---
Don't forget the currency is usually something shiny like Gems or Crystals or Gold.
---
Next promosion will be sunglasses.
---
we don't know what took to develop their version of loadouts, **they aren't templates by definition**, we do know there was a free alternative that was much more functional and less riddled with bugs than the current official solution.
---
What is the difference between both?, one is much harder to monetize as client-sided.
---
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH" SugarCube.1234
---
The only other class that can use mace: Revenant
---
I agree they should put the microtransactions in dollars. But I think the reason whey they cant do it with the gem exchange is that it will at that point be a stock exchange, and it would mean different regulations need to be followed.
---
Euros have 'taxes'. What costs 10$ will still cost 10€... kinda shitty. At least SWTOR changes depending on your country's economy; for example... Poland pays a lot less for a subscription in comparison to an EU country that uses the €.
---
Which would you say gave you more content?
---
No, most first world countries definitely don't constantly cater to those people. That's why for example, microtransactions are perfectly legal in the majority of first world countries as is alcohol.
---
Starbucks is a poor comparison because they serve food and drinks. Guild Wars 2 is a video game in a genre known for rolling a dice, so I responsibly enjoy the occasional lootbox.
---
Was partnering with MySpace not an option?
---
Because as much as I love GW2 and it truly does have an AMAZING in game community, this subreddit is a bubbling cess pool of toxic people on both sides of the canyon. It’s literally either people who hate absolutely anything that ANET does and will try to make everything a cause of contention, or others who white knight anything ANET does, even really stupid stuff. 
---
I have no problem with people liking what they like and discussion, but that usually doesn’t happen here. I’d stick with googling stuff or looking it up on the wiki before attempting to post questions here. 
---
Feel free to PM me any questions also and I can try to answer them. I can add you in game as well.
---
That's not even your throwaway account worth
---
thank god that creep quit
---
&gt; Guardian shield 4 is not a solid damage skill.
---
It has a coefficient of 1.0. Sword 1 has coefficients of 0.66/0.725/1.5, for an average coefficient of 0.96. All of these skills have activation times of a half second. That means that throwing shield 4 into the rotation should increase your average damage, while also granting protection and aegis (and probably quickness, if you took that Firebrand trait). It also has 600 range instead of 130, and hits 5 targets instead of 3, so you should be using it as an opener for a group. 
---
Now, if you can reliably hit all three waves from the third auto-attack on a single target, you'll do better DPS just autoattacking since that's a huge damage boost on that skill. But, that's really tough to pull off while running and gunning, which is what most of PvE is, not fighting a single big boss with a big hitbox and low movement (because he's sticking on a tank). 
---
Again, we're not talking about raids here. For the types of fights that happen in PvE, and including the fact that there is often a little bit of a cooldown period in between fights in PvE as you run to the next group, shield 4 does good damage. If you're fighting a mostly static opponent constantly for 5 minutes, it's not a good DPS skill. But open world PvE is much less about constant DPS and much more about having access to a couple of big spikes that you can cycle reliably. This build won't even be spending that much time with weapon skills anyway because it **really** wants to be using its F1 skills as much as possible (which have low cooldowns, and F1 recharges on kills) so that's even another reason why the 20 second cooldown does not matter for this skill.
---
&gt; Shield 5's projectile hate/heal business with a splash of CC (only useful on mobs with breakbars or if you're okay with knockback) is pretty alright
---
It's pretty normal to want at least 2-3 skills on your bar at all times that do breakbar damage in modern open world PvE. The knockback is substantial enough to be picked, and the other niche benefits aren't bad either. Also, knockback is less detrimental to this build than other melee builds because of the built-in teleport on a 10s recharge.
---
Path of Exile's MTX is insanely expensive too, especially the cosmetics, they are priced super high.
---
BS!
---
GW2 is a full pay to play game. They charged 50 bucks for the game. And they charged 50 bucks for the first expansion. And they charged 50 bucks for the second expansion.
---
Just because they changed that later doesn't mean players haven't paid already!
---
As someone who played this game a long time ago before the expansions, I honestly never felt bad buying the cosmetics like Dye packs, outfits or even the unbreakable gatherering tools that had cool animations. 
---
Back then it was mostly about helping the game stay afloat and supporting the server costs. For F2P and B2P games I honestly didn't mind spending $15 or so per month on them since thats how much a typical sub would cost. 
---
A lot of the gameplay elements they have added in in recent years from what I've seen I am personally againest though. Part of the fun of this series was leveling and exploring.
---
how about you "qq more" for not knowing?
---
Yeah, Fortnite and Apex both use really fucked up psychological tricks (mostly on children) to encourage buying cosmetics and such.
---
I'm surprised there is a newer one at all. I remember a few years ago they were closing franchises all over and filed for bankruptcy.
---
WoW was more in terms of raw volume of content, but I've gotten a lot more out of GW2's content. Every zone I hit while leveling in WoW just had a few other people like me who were racing to get to max level so that we could play BfA stuff. There was absolutely no reason for me to go back to a zone once I had finished the main quest line and leveled out of it (which was a shame because I loved certain areas like Northrend but had no incentive to stick around once I was high enough level to move on).
---
Obviously players are always going to congregate in the most recently-released zones in an MMO, but WoW felt extremely tilted in that direction as compared to GW2.
---
It's a personal attack designed to invalidate your statement. He's saying that you're arrogantly assuming that you speak for everyone - then saying that the opposite of your initial statement is true. According to him, most people have actively lost something of value by getting equipment/build templates.
---
Ironically, he's completely wrong and his second statement can be reversed to refute his own ego trip.
---
Games with sub fees generally make you pay for the expansions and base game too.
---
It doesn't work at all - longterm ;-)
---
This is why I have never bought gems with euros. Gaining gold in game is so easy anyway, don't see why you would.
---
This is one of the main reason my friends didnt come to GW2 after gw1. It was against their standards, and they found it scandalous.  
---
Meanwhile I played this game a hell of a lot, I always knew about that but I prefered to pretend it was okay. I'm pretty sure there is people like this, spending hundred and hundred just for a few gold. And that's terrible and so wrong.
---
I loved launch dungeons, I don't know what world this was where they were too hard for anyone to do?
---
To join a guild, you need to be invited by a player in a guild who has permissions to invite others.  Invites will show up in your Guild menu (press G).
---
How can you find a guild?  Look for players who share your interests and see if they have guilds that are inviting.  If your interests are playing World vs. World, look in your server's matchups/Discord for guilds.  If you like Fractals, ask people you partner up with in Fractals.  Lion's Arch and other hubs will occasionally have public recruiters, though those guilds might not be terribly personal.  There's also /r/GuildRecruitment that you can check on Reddit.
---
Guilds are account based.  You can belong to up to five guilds at once, and choose one to publicly represent next to your name, but you can communicate with any of your guilds regardless of your representation.
---
1) You get invited.
---
2)/3) Guilds advertise on the forums or in map chat, there's also /r/guildrecruitment. Find one that sounds nice and try, there's really no safe way of telling whether you'll like a guild or not.
---
4) Guilds are account based, you can join up to five guilds at a time.
---
That's a really good point. You can't withdraw that for real currency, and you can only use it on the site. Doesn't make it any less "real".
---
&gt; It can be made into a meme template
---
Template or loadouts? How many slots?
---
Sorry. :)
---
The fact of the matter is that a ton of the people who actually cared about the gameplay left the GW2 community in general years ago.  The game has aged, but we've also had a ton of content droughts.  A huge amount of the players I knew moved on to other games during the GW2 China prelaunch drought especially.  Some of the people who have stayed through it all went kind of crazy/toxic doing the same stuff over and over again, which has also hurt the reputation of playing the game seriously.
---
Personally, I almost never down vote in general and certainly didn't here, but I know a lot of people just can't be serious about the game anymore.  They don't want to be reminded of things that disappointed them, and I get where they're coming from.
---
Also, this isn't the only subreddit that drifted toward memes and art.  /r/Splatoon went through something very similar.  I've heard some speculation as to why that happens, but I'm not really an expert on the subject.
---
Well they can at least thicken the tails to make that posture seem more natural. Or I don't know. Shift their weight around a bit.
---
There's a tremendous amount of psychology that goes into this and you hit on one of the key reasons. The customer still feels mostly satisfied at getting a "refund", but the company hasn't actually done anything that really costs them any money.
---
They also are legal loop holes for laws that protect from gambling. They don't but loot boxes with dollars, you buy gems with dollars. No real money is traded for any digital goods other than gems. I know it's stupid, bug legislators are either too stupid to write good legislation, or they loop hole gives legislators enough cover to cave to the gaming lobbyists without looking too corrupt to moms and dads not looking closely enough.
---
Why do you assume that I only play one game mode? I’ve got a build and equipment set up for PVE and WvW. This update is still pure upside.
---
“Oh but you lose autoswitch!”
---
You are drastically overblowing the “inconvenience” of switching builds from PvE to WvW. It takes 5 seconds to switch gear and builds. Before you’d have to switch over from your PvE gear to WvW gear and that took longer.
---
guild wars 1 xxx parody  
---
  
---
(and I would watch that btw, Jora girl is cute af)
---
Yes, but still it is an abstract layer. You bought 1000 gems for whatever money. Alright. And some weeks or months later you see something in the store, you still have 750 gems. How much is that? You forgot how much you paid months ago. And the item you like costs 400 gems. How much is that? Is it expensive? You don't know.
---
I think you're putting the wrong cable into the wrong plug there with your reasoning for the future of the game. But that's my opinion. I think it's a waste of time and resources and does not guarantee success.
---
 Not so long ago, I decided to express the same opinion in the form of just a picture. Look how many votes she collected .... Do you need any other comments on this? 
---
[https://i.redd.it/c5ptd7yeavt31.png](https://i.redd.it/c5ptd7yeavt31.png)
---
Pretty sure the currency conversion is different per region as well.
---
It's funny that what was once a selling point for Guild Wars 2 (no sub fee! Only cosmetics in the cash shop!) is now derided as being exploitative.
---
Is there such thing as 'maining' classes in GW2?
---
In a way, all of our characers were key farmers once.
---
There's a very specific reason that it's $9.99 for 800 gems and not $10 for 1000 gems, and it's entirely to do with perception. There are reasons that it's difficult to purchase gems to trade for items resulting in a zero balance of gems, because a customer is likely to buy more if they have some sitting in their account.
---
There's a famous economist from last century who shaped the way marketing is done in our modern world and I cannot for the life of me remember his name, but he's the one who figured most of this stuff out.
---
I think it's kind of shitty that people can use the sub as their personal comic/art feed. I'd like to see an end to it.
---
You want that 2000 gems mount skin? Boy, gimme those 30$.
---
You say that, but half of the FFXIV Reddit is actually fan art. Way more fan art than this sub has ever seen.
---
Fair enough, wasn't considering that cause there's no point to buy gems in advance since they always cost the same.
---
Do you? It's funny to see people proposing regulating lootboxes for being potentially harmful to impulsive/mentally ill people when they originate in an entertainment medium that for decades has been criticized as being addictive as a whole (MMOs especially).
---
If this is really about concern for minors, then they shouldn't be allowed to play these multiplayer games at all. Time is a more valuable and plentiful currency than money for minors, and so many let their grades/social development slip as a result.
---
Five years ago they released update that changed the Trading Post/BLTC UI (which among other things removed the useful [graph](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/a/ac/Currency_Exchange_Market_Data.jpg) in exchange section) and there were no custom fields for currencies - their original idea was to make people always stay with leftovers but community went nuclear and [they reverted the change](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2kszbl/game_update_notes_october_30_2014/).
---
From that point panel is still the same and while it's not ideal, it's still better than what happened in 2014.
---
Except, what it really does is, when you have been convinced to pull out your wallet for a cool thing, you only buy the amount of gems you need for that thing. You never opt for a larger package because there is zero incentive to do so.
---
I hope humanity would come with the laws against fake currencies tied to real ones in the games. Like I tired of alt-tabing to calculator every time I think "does this mount actually worth my money witch I could spent on maybe actual meal/clothes/flowers/cake/tabletop game/etc"
---
What data would you want presented? It's a matter of knowing that you can't ruin everything for the majority of people for the sake of keeping every little group safe. You wouldn't be playing MMOs at all if the 20th century conservative lobby had their way.
---
Because lootboxes add a whole new factor to it! It is like being addicted to smoking cigarettes and now they even add hemp to it. 
---
Gambling is highly regulated for a reason! Not just by age but also factors of win/loss. And now there are some gaming companies that just shit on all of that, ignore age limits, ignore other regulations and just do what they like.
---
If the price were regionalized (by country / currency) and converted accordingly ... I wouldn't mind paying R$100 (BRL) for 8000 gems. But currently I need to pay R$415.00 (BRL) for 8000 gems. This is almost 50% of the minimum wage. 
---
It's crazy to pay R$415 for 8000 gems, which by the way allows you to buy only cosmetics most of the time.
---
Cosmetics do not give enough financial return. There has to be something more, not something that takes away competitiveness but is a facilitator, for example: leveling more fast (new characters, masteries, etc), completly set with specific stats, increase drop rate, etc. Or just to convert "gems to gold", but it's really worth it.
---
This is a really complicated subject, and I understand that both ANET has to win as well as the players. If only one side wins, the game does not go far and / or will not have an acceptable rate of return (first time players entering and staying for an acceptable minimum time).
---
I believe that if ANET becomes closer to the players this scenario may change. The game has to be fun to play, and basic features should be free. The price of the gem has to go down and somehow it has to be something other than cosmetics, but it doesn't hinder the game's competitiveness (PVP and WvW - because in PVE I think it doesn't matter if you have an extra advantage)
---
Back when I still spent money on this game I would usually just convert the leftover gems to gold. As someone who sometimes did that anyways (I played mostly WvW... you know how it goes) it made sense at the time.
---
I imagine there are many others that did/do the same.
---
It is not about how long it takes, it is about that you have to do it at all. You didn't gain anything with these "templates". The only thing that happend was losing convenience - and that's the whole story. Besides false advertising (not in a juridical way tho).
---
Better than what I would have done to him...
---
&gt; The only thing that happend was losing convenience - and that's the whole story.
---
Your entire argument is based on a false assumption. You keep saying that I lost convenience. The opposite is true.
---
 It takes less time to hit the hotkeys to swap to my WvW gear and WvW build templates than it did for me to swap my gear under the original system.
---
&gt; Deferred Revenue
---
How it can be tho? Effectively you could not deduct your virtual funds from account even if you not spent them for in-game goods yet. (aside direct bank refunds in the 1st world countries)
---
Any in-game good is usually simple database entry of your account unlocked feature or not. Any server load of unlocking it and using it is tied to operational costs.
---
So, since there aren't many Quiznos left, this seems like it would be an exclusive item.
---
I'd rather everyone stop with the bullshit "bulk pricing". It allows to price something at say, $5 thresholds while you can only buy $4 packs of gems. So for your first purchase, that $5 item is really $8.
---
you probably forgot that in Europe we usually have a pretty high VAT.
---
In short, it works in all of em :3
---
GW2 is probably on the low end of egregious "micro" transactions.  I'm not going to defend them as they have a lot of stuff in their shop that is way overpriced.
---
Other games like Tree of Savior, BDO, or mobage's like Fire Emblem Heroes, Dragalia Lost, and the new TOS mobile game.. uhh.. something-whisper (idr) are rife with fake currency transactions costing ~50-100 dollars.  It's absolutely insane how little this market is being properly regulated, and how so many devs are switching to this bullshit because of how obvious of a lucrative cash grab it is.
---
Haven't heard people complain they had to sign up and give data away and then never get a code.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Is there anything inherently bad - other than it being a weird partner?
---
But I don’t run away.  I see the gem price, go into the “buy gems” tab and figure out on the spot how much real world money it translates into.
---
Any data, for instance, rather than just the regurgitation of logically inconsistent personal beliefs.
---
Buying fake currency with fiat currency...
---
exactly, from the 20€ you pay (minus the transaction fee that would be the same for all currencies) ArenaNet gets only 16.8€ considering a 19% VAT, some have even more.
---
But COLORED TITLES guys! This is peak GW2!   /s
---
I used to really like his videos, but then watched his twitch videos once and he's just an entitled, whiny jerk. No wonder he hides behind a potato. He'll back Arenanet for anything so long as he keeps getting ad revenue.
---
hit the dude so he doesn't reset, then you have all time in the world...you do not need to send him over to the next circle directly.  
---
if you play mesmer it is even pretty easy to solo whole path 4.
---
Is there anyway to disable game tips? Right now I'm in a strange mix.
---
I'm at level 80, but I'm pretty far ahead from unlocking Masteries (I still doing personal story and want to do things in order, which means finishing persona story and season 2). So the game auto-select the Mentor Mastery XP bar for you. When it's done, it keep a pop up telling you to use you Mastery point, but I didn't unlock Masteries so I can't. So the gave every 1 minutes show up a pop telling me to that I'm wasting my XP. This is getting pretty annoying and I can't easily close this pop up (small X).
---
That's why you make sure to have stealth
---
I've personally played through hot without salvage-o-matic and I had no issues with it. It just seemed like a qol improvement and nothing else.
---
Roy's stream
---
Yes. It's not a matter of keys changing. When this change went live, everyone who owned PoF also received HoT. It's not a new product they're selling, the change is built to the game itself.
---
Hey the tea thing finally worked for me!  Eventually!

Ask for what data you want presented instead of this cringeworthy Reddit argumentative tactic of demanding le epic Rational Scientific Method that nobody is expecting because it's not a situation that anyone would expect to present research.
---
So what data do you want? Do you want rigorously peer reviewed data backing up the claim that "most people don't approve of things they enjoy being taken away or banned because of a minority might be harmed by them?"

 Hello there!
---
We are a group of 8 frinds that are going to start playing Guild Wars 2. We wanted a MMORPG that we could play, level up and explore together at the same time, so we decided to take one that none of us had played before. That being said, since we will start playing at the same time and no one has any experience with GW2, we would like to have some advices before jumping in the game, in the case it could make our life easier and/or guide us in the right direction. FYI, we will all be paying the $30 in order to have both expansions.
---
Some quick questions I have on my mind right now:
---
* What would be the biggest difference comparing GW2 with the other MMORPGs?
---
* Any setting/addons you would recommand?
---
* How long is the part of the game before we can group together, assuming we're starting at different locations?
---
* Is there a specific class we should have in the group?
---
* Is there a preffered server we should play on?
---
* Is there some useful stuff we could purchase in-game? How much and where?
---
* Which region would you suggest us to explore first?
---
* Any useful webesite contains an item database and/or information about raids/event/puzzles?
---
* If you were to create a new character, what would be the first thing you'd rush for? And why?
---
* There's no Tank/DPS/Healer system in this game, isn't it?
---
* Any other things you wish you'd know sooner?
---
Thanks to everyone!
---
Wow you guys remember personal story.
---
Idk why people are complaining about BUYABLE build templates. 
---
Its completely optional and its only for QoL, like most bought stuff in the store. 
---
As long as Anet doesn't sell things that directly affect damage output or individual or bundled items that make ascended stats obsolete, they can do what ever the fuck they want with their cosmetics. 
---
You're all complaining about what Anet is selling for $5, have you seen what other games out there are selling? $12 for a single champion skin that can only be used and seen every other 20min. 
---
Worst of all, quality is not always of the highest value.
---
I just feel like someone’s going to say in map chat “hahahah look at this IDIOT doesnt know how to split/link items”
---
At PAX Australia, FF14 had a massive boost and was getting a ton of attention. That's probably a better idea than a sandwich code.
---
lol WP´= biggest noob,when its comes to balance/profesion skills.
---
7 years of waiting for build templates? Anet gave us all 3 different slots for each character. 
---
You're complaining because Anet is trying to monetize a game when they are giving us free DLC map, story, and item content for over a year and a half now. 
---
Please. 
---
If you have to complain about something, complain about the fact that we can't buy a certain amount of gems.
---
There is an option "custom exchange" so you can buy any quantity of gems.
---
Yeah sure, I meant the cosmetic armor sets and particle effects. It's $50-60+ for an armor set and an effect in PoE, and I feel like the game being free doesn't excuse that.
---
&gt; but sometimes you gotta take a look at reality.
---
This is what the guy said. All I'm saying is it's "his" reality. Or maybe "your" reality. Do you think everyone that's dissatisfied is singing the same song? Because I don't. 
---
Of course people have different needs. But that you said here doesn't change what I've said one whit. By all means ask for the changes you want. But don't make it sound that anyone who's enjoying the game is not looking at reality because frankly, that's rude. That's setting yourself on a higher plane. Your needs are better or more important than anyone else's. Many people play this game. We all have different realities. That's all I'm saying.
---
Thanks for the reply.

Aren't we always missing a chrono or two?

Don’t really have a color scheme, although starting out it would be dressed like a guard/seraph. It’s basically a poor average footsoldier of a garrison turned mercenary/adventurer. Blank slate looking forward to what the future holds. Looks would be lean and average sized, not rugged or muscular.
---
Thanks for the advice ^^
---
What savings!
---
Why does Arena net have such wierd ways to advertise? First a clock and now a sandwich. Any advertising is better than none I suppose...
---
Don't forget Kung Fu Tea!
---
And developers get imaginary money as salary?
---
Quiznos sounds like the name of an alien from a 50s movie
---
It kind of boggles the mind. Like the original GW2 live action trailer for the launch made you feel like they were underselling the game. Turns out it would set the trend for 7 years to come.
---
You need to do these estimates per country. Most people don't live in USA or Germoney.
---
Sorry, the what rumors?
---
Srsly, never even heard of it, can someone explain?
---
That's... Weirdly accurate...
---
I'm gonna be honest here, for raids I continue to use Holo, but for fractals I've completely dropped it in favour of berserker scrapper.
---
Scrapper is just way too good for pugs. Function Gyro is a stupid tool kit skill but it's still a safety net, and the barrier conversion allows you to face tank ludicrous amounts of damage. I actually think the time wasted dodging and blocking attacks as Holo puts Scrapper above it in fractals. I rarely need to dodge. I can just sit right in the fray and go through a hammer rotation with shredder gyro and never die.
---
I mean really, WvW roaming is about running fun things too, i play flamethrower scrapper and often have sucess with it.
---
it's AAAAHHHHHH!!!🎉🎊🎉🎊

4 As, 6 Hs, 3 exclamation mark, :tada:, :confetti_ball:, :tada:, :confetti_ball:

I'm actually going to throw you in a different direction, and say with what you're interested in, you might actually want to look at Mesmer
---
If you have to choose between those three, neither guardian nor necro are what I'd call swift or sneaky
---
I don't understand this argument at all, if you were being charged in real dollars there's no reason to be holding that at the end at all. Look at how final fantasy xiv store looks:

You don't preload funbux you just buy things upfront. Since gw2 has a gem to gold thing players would want to keep gems so what you do is make 1000 gems = $10 to make it easy to read prices in gems then you make it so if you don't have enough gems to cover the purchase (say you want to buy a 749 gem item and you have 200 gems from converting gold) it just pops up a box saying "you don't have enough gems, we will need to charge you $5.49 for 549 gems to cover the rest of this purchase" and that way you can buy directly and know how much things will cost.
---
look, Boneskinner made you a sandwich
---
Deflection because you know you're taking the wrong position on the core issue.
---
At least everything they make is account bound, though I do agree with you. Composting was clearly meant to eat up supplies of unwanted worthless food.
---
There's also quite a bit more legal background that jumps into it as well. As far as "purchasing" is concerned, it's 100% finished the second you have gems; so long as you got the gems for your money, then entire transaction is done, valid, nothing more that can be seen by the bank or whatnot.
---
Anything you want to "buy" with gems is, like you said, purely virtual currency, so anet (or ncsoft, whichever) has 100% control over it.
---
Now in the concept of a game that's usually fine, and you don't see (too) many issues about it, but when you start to see this in places like money exchanges and what not, that's where as a customer you need to be weary.
---
It’s ok for power, but you’d have an easier time playing DH, power chrono or maybe Weaver.
---
I forgot to speak about condi version.
---
Condi Holo / Condi Engi are good, one of the best options in the game (Specially the core one) the only problem is the hard rotation, but if u domain it, u have a solid condi option even in serious runs.
---
If you use tumblr, you can also sometimes find people putting out feelers for RP in the guild wars 2, gw2, or gw2rp tags. I found a really awesome guild that way!
---
It looks like it's because you can craft it yourself or buy it.  And the only flag the composter checks is "is this a craftable food?".  The one oddity with this idea being the Karka Egg Omelette, which means it must be flagged as craftable in the game, but I guess we just never were given the recipe for it.
---
I legit saw Brother Drake and others repping that guild yesterday. The pilgrimage is all the way over in Elona now. :)
---
i always wondered if people like you never get world completion because they refuse to visit the village of butcher's block for meatoberfest
---
Because if heaven forbid you make a post suggesting that thief weapons are a hot mess and have been since BWE1 people get really REALLY upset
---
Is two hours a day for five years a job?
---
Are they promo emails? If so, nothing to worry about, the auto mailer probably just got weird. 
---
Are they account related emails, giving you your 2FA code to enter? If so that is something to worry about and you need to re-secure your account.
---
It helps that someone asks this question once every other month
---
You can always try all 3, with PvP unlocked you can hop into the PvP lobby and try out what it would be like at level 80 with everything unlocked. 
---
In general though guardians have burning, blocks, and regen with a couple teleports. They place a lot of symbols on the ground that have passive effects in them. Also good at creating barriers and summoning spirit weapons to attack. 
---
Thieves have lots of stealth and mobility. Not as much AoE as some other options but they have preparations they set up (basically traps that you trigger), venoms to apply to their attacks and steal that gives them a stolen skill depending on who they hit with it. Again very mobile and has range with pistols and short bow.
---
Necromancer is usually seen with minions when leveling but they have a death shroud that protects them and gives them new skills, marks you place on the ground with staff along with wells that damage and apply conditions to enemies in them. Lots of boon removal/corruption and conditions (both to enemies and even yourself). Very tank option if you want to go minions otherwise does have controlling skills that might be what you're looking for?
---
\&gt; nothing really changed aside from +1 equipment storage.
---
Any improvement is still an improvement. Most people spend most of their time in their preferred game mode anyways, plus we also got the account wide build storage, plus the native build sharing and previewing.
---
New system is worse than Arc. &lt;- Reasonable, but you have to admit it does come with some upsides.
---
New system is worse than the old. &lt;- Nonsense. Absolute nonsense.
---
Power Holosmith is basically a discount Dragonhunter. It's totally fine at every raid level outside of ultra-optimized speedclears on every power boss.
---
Condition Holosmith is *significantly* worse than other options on condition fights. It loses out a lot in utility/survivability to Firebrand and Scourge, doesn't do enough confusion to be broken like Mirage on Largos and SH, and if you want a "selfish DPS" Weaver is better.
---
I wasn't aware Quiznos still existed...
