Thanks. I did get one from one of those code. (Forgot which one, lol). I just rush through a few of them that didn’t work, probably was taken before me. And finally one of them worked.
---
---
---
You said it was a general thought which I took to mean for the future of gw2 and future games. You proposed the change in the most vague way possible, if my interpretation of your vague statement was not what you meant the statement to be then idk maybe try not being so vague next time instead of trying to be smart afterwards. :)
---
&gt; Can I level doing the Halloween event?
---

---
Yes, specifically in the mad king's labyrinth
---
&gt;Ranger soul beast spec - is it ever viable to just sit in beast mode? I like the idea of it but dislike having pets in general so never having to see it is nice haha
---
You mean like [this build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/)?
---
Yes, it's viable to do so
---
&gt; How’s the population doing after arenanets announcement of no more expansions etc.
---
It's fine, there have definitely been some people who left, but it's not nearly as apocalyptic as some people also like to make it seem. Some of the hardcore communities might be running a little dry, but I haven't really had any major issues finding groups recently.
---
And it's not like we're not getting more content, it's just a question for some people of whether it's actually enough
---
That beach is my favorite spot in the game. One time I took a dev there, since their specialization doesn't involve knowing about the development of the maps; it was fun to introduce them to an area of their own game that they'd never seen before.
---
They promised me they wouldn't seal up the hole through which you escape the map after we fully explored the area to confirm you couldn't get to any of the map completion objectives that require completion of the meta, which would constitute an unfair advantage.
---
I do know the other breakouts in a completely different area of the map where you can reach those map objectives, but I spared them those so that they wouldn't be compelled to patch them.

Just tried them all, and non work anymore, so assume all gone, Thanks though for sharing them
---
Seems like all the codes are already used, but still thank you!
---
EDIT: Just received a code from the OP. Thank you very much again &lt;3
---
tbh I always found it strange that people waste their dominant hand on the mouse. Same with driving stick and since you mentioned it, controllers.
---
Guess I'm cross-dominant and no one told me. :(
---
And I qoute "This last one is just a general thought and a consideration for **future games** due to the extreme affect it would have on the game."**
---
Did you have to buy anything? Was this in the US?
---
You know, it's a statement on how this perfunctory this goodbye was that *I didn't even realize Rox was officially gone* in Bound by Blood. Oh yeah, I mean, I knew she wasn't there. But I didn't realize she wasn't just away for a while. (In retrospect, this should have been obvious: The charr meetup with the on Charr character absent, y'know?)
---
But as usual, Snargle and co are here to fill in the things I can't say. The battle is far from over still; why even think about family when there's so much left to do before we can be certain there will even be homes left to live in?
---
I don't think it's at random, it's the X closest targets (Where X is the skill target limit)
---
lol TP barons aren't the ones selling ToT bags right now. 
---
They're buying them.
---
Me, a mesmer: I came out here to have a good time and am honestly feeling so attacked right now
---
Hiya - I played a ton of GW1 in a guild, played 4man PvP, Guild vs. Guild, Tombs, etc.  Mostly played a warrior then.
---
Thinking about taking advantage of the free part of GW2 to give it a shot.  
---
1. The classes all seem very different from the wiki.  I used to really like interrupt skills in GW1 that you had to react or time to stop your opponents' skills during cast times, are there any classes that do that?  
---
2. Should I just pick one of the 9 base classes from what sounds cool to me, or should I have one of the end specializations in mind if I do eventually buy the expansions?
---
3. How rough is the learning curve, would I be able to play with a team from a guild and not screw things up too badly or does it require hundreds of hours of learning all the interactions in the game?
---
Thanks.
---
When my friend tried to create a new account to join me in game he gets an "unespecified error" when he presses "confirm". I tried too with no luck. Anyone knows a workaround? (Appears on the Spanish version of the website)
---
On the off-chance you're talking about [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dghg3z/i_made_a_tool_for_people_with_too_many_arc_builds/f3bytmv/), I haven't released it yet. Once the update hits tomorrow, I'll be adapting it to GW2's template codes and adding remaining stuff like ranger pet and revenant legend selectors for arcdps-&gt;gw2 conversion process. Hopefully I'll be done with it within a day or two.
---
&gt; Graphics options take developer time to make. It only makes sense that it should cost 1000 gems to unlock the options panel. Don't you want to support the devs?
---
This community, apparently.
---
Just to touch on 3, they never announced that there would be no more expansions, they just announced that there isn't one pending.  With the two expansions they have had, announcements of the expansion have never come before the release of the last Living Story episode before them.
---
While they're never going to confirm it ahead of time, I would expect the third expansion to be announced at the end of the Icebrood Saga.  When Path of Fire released, they said that Season Four and Season Five of Living Story would be following it, letting us know in advance not to get our hopes up for an expansion after Season Four.  But at no point have they said there would never be another expansion, so...
---
They're treating GW2 like a free2play mobile game. That's the future of GW2 and ArenaNet.
---
Not that free2play mobile games can't be fun. Just expect everything to be monetized and a huge pain in the arse unless you're willing to spend literally thousands on the game.
---
Chances are he's trying to create a new account using an Email already being used for a GW1 or GW2 account.  If he already has an account tied to that Email, have him use that.  Otherwise, have him sign up using a different Email to see if that works.

8 of 9, College adjunct of Statics.
---
The evade it shares is useful. I don't really use it for anything else.
---
for making gold i would strongly recommend dragonfall, especially with a decent commander
---
you'd need to get 700bags/h in lab to break even with dragonfall, which most people can't
---
DF is far more relaxing and people are overall nicer there and yea..35g/h if done properly which is easier to achieve than the mythical 700bags+/h or perfect riba rotations
---
another farm would be fractal 42 or 96 but that's extremely repetitive and mindnumbing so i wouldn't recommend it
---
If you have any left, GW2 Wiki contributor, Tyndel should get one. [He uploads every miniature image on wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:ListFiles?limit=50&amp;ilsearch=&amp;user=Tyndel). You could say he is very dedicated to it. [I don't see Icebrood Saga Ogre uploaded](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Icebrood_Saga_Ogre) so we can guess he doesn't own it. If you want I can act as middleman and send it to him in game.

I think OP means ascent to madness since it's Halloween

&gt; Also this fall, Quiznos is celebrating an epic new saga of gameplay for the multiplayer online role-playing game Guild Wars 2 with special reward codes available in-store. Quiznos guests will receive a card containing a unique code for in-game items in Guild Wars 2 with every order including at least one sub from **November 1 through November 30**, 2019, while supplies last.
---
[removed]
---
It's less storage than we had for free, but now you have to pay... three times. It's aggressively monetized (including them charging you to store a text string on their server... optional but still) and the implementation is very awkward to the point that sharing ascended gear between characters actually gains nothing.
---
Then they marketed it as more slots for gem store outfits so you can hot-swap those. The whole thing just feels greedy and soulless.
---
Condi banner warrior
---
Ah idk if we have quiznos here in toronto. Good for you for sharing.
---
All of what I'm about to tell you boils down to give it a shot, but here are some more details:
---
I would recommend you try whatever class appeals to you thematically. Every class can pretty much play any role in a group once you have it maxed out, it just depends how you build it.
---
As far as interrupts go, it's definitely less of a thing than it is in gw1, but that's partly because the game is much faster paced. There aren't very many long casts period. That being said, interrupts do exist. Every class in the game has some form of hard cc, which means you can interrupt things in some way with anything. 
---
You might find yourself drawn to Mesmer because it is very geared towards disruption and punishing people (I should mention that Mesmer is pretty different than it is in gw1, as it is much more focused on illusions).
---
You might also consider warrior. Hammer warrior is very good at cc, and if you decide to buy the expansions the spellbreaker elite spec is right up your alley. Imagine if a Mesmer was a physical combatant, that's kind of the idea.
---
If you don't like one character you can always try another. The game is quite fast to level in, and it only gets easier to level alts after you have a Max level character.
---
As far as difficulty goes, you can kind of pick your poison. The game has an extremely high skill cap but is also very forgiving in many areas. If you level your character to level 80 without boosts you should have a decent understanding of your professions skills. From there you can start to jump into competitive or harder pve content and improve your skills.
---
Finally, if you want to get a preview of a profession at Max level, you can enter the PvP lobby from the PvP menu right after the tutorial and you will be maxed out in there (PvP has everyone on an equal playing field), and you can test out your profession on the training targets in the lobby.
---
You do you man, your comics have never failed to get a laugh. I'm still chuckling over the Iron Legion one. Don't listen to this chucklefuck unless you feel you want to change.
---
There's 3 different templates. Gear templates are char-specific (you start with 2... and 1 is what you already have so you're really just getting 1). Each character has 3 Build templates, which are the skills/traits/abilities/whatever. These can be copied and sent to other people via a link or text string, like waypoints now.
---
There's also an account-wide Build Vault or whatever, that stores those extra builds (which are just text strings) for you. You start with 3 slots, and get 3 free on release. Then you have to pay for more storage in the build vault... i.e. you're paying them to store a text string link for you.
---
All in all it's 3 cash grabs in the same system, and 2 of those will work the same was as copy/pasting a link to notepad.
---
I have only 1 quiznos shop in my country and I don't think they are offering this promotion :(
---
Can you even read? Lol
---
It's not quite a "Dungeon Rush event", but this year's Halloween added two new weapon skins that require dungeon completion to obtain.  That's a real scenario, isn't it?
---
I see, thanks for the info! Kinda ridiculous
---
Quiznos....now there's a name I haven't heard in a while.
---
I bind all my weapon/utility skills around WASD and heal on middle mouse button, since I NEED it to be responsive in pvp. It took some time for me to get used to it but I never looked back. I pretty much only use the mouse to control the camera.

oh, I read that as "more receptive this year", my bad

arcdps: d3d9.dll in the bin64 folder
---
d912pxy: d3d9_chainload.dll in the bin64 folder
---
taco works fine normally.
---
I would recommend you work on getting a set of Marauder gear. It's still very high damage but it also has vitality. It's a much easier ride to play Marauder in open world than berzerker.
---
opportunity cost. just because you farmed them doesnt make it free. youre effectively spending the same amount of gold on them as you would have gotten from selling them.
---
yeah just uninstall d912 and put in arc dll, then reinstall d912 and when it asked what you want to install it as in the command prompt choose the "chainload" option
---
Missed it, but thank you for sharing!  That was really nice you took the time to do that.
---
Usually experience farming falls in line with gold farming. With that said, it'd be Dragonfall, which is accessed by having Living World Season 4 Episode 6,  and basically you just do the map metas.
---
I don't know if it's *the* fastest, but it's *one of* the fastest ways.
---
it is still soloable
---
So, about these living world episodes. There isn't a way to get them without paying? I mean, is kinda messed up   having to pay for a quest of an expansion you already bought.
---
One of the fastest ways to get mastery experience, this is what I do myself, is to load up as many XP buffs as you can get your hands on on find creatures that have a high XP bonus.
---
XP bonus comes with a creature has been a alive for a long time without being killed. There are plenty of places where people just ignore stuff like Shadvar and moas. Kill a few things, if they bonus is low move onto another group.
---
You can level remarkably quickly doing this.
---
Which is right back to where we started this thread, and the comparison.
---
You can farm gold, then convert that to gems. I don't know what's the current conversion rate but an episode is 200 gems I think. The wiki is more specific on the costs.
---
Good bot? Wonder why iOS autocorrected from the proper spelling (or near proper) to that particular choice.
---
I'm thinking keep an eye on the trading post activity and wait a little while to sell.
---
They woulda done it already I bet. :/
---
Think this post may have spurred a drop in TP prices, haha.
---
Someone told me that when they ship their foods out, you had to get it from the same place and it was a total nightmare to do.  One thing I noticed though too was that they closed at like 7 or 8pm.  You'd go to grab dinner and they had the chairs up and the lights off.  Who does that?
---

Your best bet to get exp fast in my experience is to do the meta events in the map.  For Heart of Thorns this was fairly simple, since every map has a chain of meta events that overflow with exp.  Path of Fire though, you're going to likely need a Living World Season 4 map to actually get good meta events.  If you don't have access to those, then you'll probably want to stick to doing the Maw of Torment meta event in The Desolation.  I THINK that it should give you a good amount of exp, since there's several events that are in the meta "chain" so to speak, and there's constant mobs spawning.  There's likely several that know better than me though, so try it, see how it goes.
---
One bit you might want to check though, is make sure you have enough mastery points to learn the masteries as you unlock them.  If you don't have enough, you could go hunt down what gives mastery points, and likely get some exp in the process.
---
... Now I want to see it.
---
I enjoy going through dungeons and  especially achievement farming
---
Most of the stuff you can't forge came for free from leveling. It's not meant to do anything except give you a stat upgrade to make you a bit more powerful. It's not meant to be sold. As such, it's served it's purpose.
---
I've already seen a few. You can, again, just copy and paste to and from a notepad .txt file as well.
---
Oh I just don't wanna have to alt tab hah
---
Actually it is.  The image was taken by NASA on October 8 by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO. They use filters to capture images of the sun so they can see the hot spots. That's what that is. No different than a digital picture taken by your phone. It's just filtered to keep the intense energy from burning up the image sensor.
---
Thanks alot.
---
This is the first time i actually see Sigil of Fire being played xD
---
Can i Ask what a spotter is ?
---
Less to do with clipping and more to do with mounts and tonics being on the same system.
---
Alts going through the first part of the PoF story netted a good amount of xp.
---
Let's count how much money I'll need to spend to max out templates on all of the characters I play. Also let's count the amount of money wasted on the bag slots, where I used to store equipment sets, which are now kinda obsolete (answer: 40 slots, i.e. 16k gems).
---
And now let's count how many months until the next piece of content where the build templates actually matter.
---
Think of them like mini-expansions that you get for free if you log in during the release window.
---
Oh, I get It. What Season 4 episode(s) should I buy then?
---
The  Solar Dynamics Observatory has to use a very dark filter to take the pics. Without it the energy would burn out the image sensors. 
---
[https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
---
You started this discussion by saying to me:
---
&gt;"Pressure" sure sounds like criticism but ok.
---
You said that in response to when I said:
---
&gt; Stating the facts isn't criticism.
---
And now you have described some of Anet's techniques as pressure.  Do you feel like your being critical by using that term? Or do you feel like your simply stating the facts?  
---
I would argue, your simply stating the facts.  I would also argue, it is simply a fact that Anet pressures you to buy inventory through tons of unnecessary loot.  Everyone assumes that is a bad thing.  The game has to be monetized somehow.  But everyone conflates, 'its not so bad' with, 'that isn't what they are doing'.
---
It isn’t a true Tarir meta without at least one picnic and one Aviator Memory Box, with someone being Very Pissed Off about the box!
---
Yes, please! And let me trade a good quantity for Transmutation Charges for each slot.
---
1 wing, with 2 or 3 bosses, every 9 months.
---
Which is going to feel the same as 1 wing every year.
---
If living world was 1 episode per year, you'll notice a big difference in what the larger community feels.
---
Also the last fractal was in january, WvW alliances have been promised for like 2 years and same for PvP swiss format tournaments.
---
So yea, any dedicated player will probably move on.
---
True, you do have a point there, but lab farming is one of the more efficient farms out there and with rather high bags/hour and casual farming on my end it's worth it for me. Plus If I'd sell the bags, I'd get 12g per stack or 48g for 1k. If I'd convert that into a coffer I'd be getting at least 60+ gold making 20g in the process. I'd say that's free gold for just a bit of clicking.
---
Healbrand Guardian is the go-to now.... at least until anet decides to nerf it because they're bored and want to feel useful.
---
1. I play one in T4 fractals. Good news, you'll never be without a group! Bad news, you'll never be able to play anything else...
---
2. Druids can't cover quickness or alacrity, so you still need one of the Firebrigades. At least from what I know, I'm not that far into raids yet.
---
3. A semi-recent update allowed ALL stat-selectable trinkets to choose ALL stats. The bitterfrost ones can't be harrier's now.
---
4. Ascended is mandatory for fractals because you need the infusion slots. You can get through T2 fractals with just trinkets. T4 fractals drop ascended armor chests semi-regularly, so you'll get a second set (and more) by playing those for a while.
---
But...
---
Your damage is balls with healing gear. Might as well buy a cheap set of DPS exotics to get by for a while in other stuff.
---
Spotter is a buff. Adds 100 precision IIRC
---
Arena Net has pretty much put that content on backlist and many of the old raiders and “hardcore” community left the game. Myself included. I do prowl around the reddit from time to time but in my personal opinion anyway, this game is headed in the wrong direction. If you want that sorta content I don’t think there’s much left for you in the game. Raiding had its days but not anymore;
---
https://gw2dungeons.net/Records#23d5wPx2Xg
---
Back in the day, the common strat was a thief that knew how to stealth to skip the trash mobs.  
---
You said the short path, so I assume path 3.  That one has a lot of long stealth runs.  With the nerf of dungeon rewards, all the skilled vets left dungeons, and now you get a lot of groups that kill those trash mobs instead.  
---
It sucks, but you missed the golden age of dungeons in gw2, at least as far as casual pugging goes.  There was a time when it was a lot better. 
---
A lot of people on this thread are saying their groups still fill, my experience is they fill with bad players now.  It sucks =/
---
Their new projects teams were dismissed, that’s why Mo left the company.Don’t expect any new ArenaNet games.
---
I've been doing triple trouble pretty regularly for about 5 months now - I'd say averaging at least 5x a week. I've had two regurgitated armor chests drop (once the last week of july, once in september), as well as a zintl weapon and a zintl armor box.  Between guild chat and map chat post-wurms, I generally see at least one regurg box and one to two rando ascended boxes get yelled about, but obvs the accuracy of those are gonna be up for debate.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On the other hand, I've probably done the tequatl fight roughly as many times since it launched?  And I've only ever received one weapon box in that time, and maaaaaybe one rando ascended box.
---
Sounds about right. I've been doing TT for 3 - 4 months now without a drop, hopefully due soon. For teq my experience is similar to yours.
---
I feel there’s a major difference between EU and NA in this regard. Raid leg in EU seems to have much more activity.
---
Id say wing 4 is easier then 1, although Deimos can be a pain. The first 3 bosses are all among the easiest.
---
Thanks for sharing these with the community. Sucks that we in Europe never get any giveaways or partnerships like this :(
---
Yes.  I've been saying this since the announcement and nobody seems to understand it.  
---
We currently have one 'template' on our equipment page.  They're just giving us 1 more.  There is no save or load button.
---
Yikes. How did they fuck this up so badly.
---
Take these comments with a grain of salt, it’s the usual Reddit game-is-dying doom and gloom. There is still an active raiding community. I would recommend the Discord route of finding a group, as mentioned elsewhere in this thread.
---
It's dying fast in raids/wvw/pvp. Mmorpg without an expansion is dead. Build templates fiesta only accelerated the dying rates
---
directly from the github https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Using-with-other-addons-and-overlays
---
If you use GW2Radial install d912pxy as d912pxy.dll
---
If you use ArcDPS but not GW2Radial, install d912pxy as d3d9_chainload.dll
---
If you use ArcDPS and GW2Radial, install ArcDPS as d3d9.dll, GW2Radial as d3d9_chainload.dll, and d912pxy as d912pxy.dll
---
I disagree that it is a solid point, sorry. The main reason for this is that the circumstances for "difficult" content being released hasn't really changed. We've been on the same raid release cadence for over three years and it wasn't seen by the community to be an issue with the release of W4 or W5 or W6 and instead only now with W7.
---
So if the game isn't changing too much since LS3 Ep1 with the release cadence, what is changing? That would be the players, who have become used to the content and have mastered it.
---
The rest of your points only support what I am saying - things like festivals are uninteresting *to you* (and me for what it is worth) . The content is still plenty interesting for a lot of players so the viewpoint is subjective and, imo, to be expected given how long some people have played this game for.
---
Aside from that, I don't really follow. I don't think it is valid to complain that story is too easy. It needs to be. Just look at LFR in WoW, introduced so people could do that story. And while current events are nice (and have been continuing) they are exactly any more difficult than the story. 
---
So your point breaks down here a little bit is. Is the issue the lack of challenging content (which has been on the same cadence since 3 and a half years ago) or is it the lack of stopgap content that isn't festivals?
---
Then you ain't doing it right.
---
I'm hoping for more strike missions not just build templates
---
Anet never do countdowns for updates.
---
It wasn't an overflow as you would think of the overflow maps in PvE.
---
There is only one instance per borderlands map and if that instance is full then you wouldn't be able to join the WvW maps until a slot on the map is getting free and you are next in the queue. That was pretty much the state on prime time which made it pretty hard to actually play it. This was even worse when the Tournaments were happening.
---
IIRC whenever you change the map you will lose your queue slot and have to enter the queue all over again. This made players just AFK in Lions arch and even falling asleep and missing their queue pop to enter so players stopped getting into WvW entirely.
---
EOTM was an attempt to prevent that, to give players the opportunity to play WvW without much commitment on a map to wait for the queue to pop. 
---
If you look at [this](https://www.requnix.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/PvP3.jpg) picture and [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Power_of_the_Mists) in the Wiki you will see that you gained A bonus depending on how good your world was. A 20% additional Gathering use was huge if you had it at max level.
---
With the Alliance system, EOTM will probably get some importance back because worlds are created dynamically which would mean that the queues probably get full again and therefore players go to EOTM again to wait for the queue.
---

---
Why would you hope for something that they have in no way or form even hinted at is coming with todays update..?
---
No point in making gw3.
---
It would have the same issues gw2 has

Bad decisions, fuck ups, moronic monetization decisions, hilarious balance patches.

I spot a person of culture !

I was going through old comments and, its funny, I just noticed you never actually attempted to justify your blatant and unapologetic support of whitewashing after it was proven that you were in favour of it [here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxutuy/jormags_va_is_female/eyti9ha/)
---
So, did you ever get over your fear of "the other" are you still afraid of anyone who doesn't look and think like you?

Hi captain,
---
I used to do fractals (a bit of raid too in the old times), and I don't see a lot of druids today.
---
The most common duo support are Firebrand (heal/quickness whith harrier stats mainly) + Renegade (alacrity whith diviner stats mainly). this setup allows to bring a LOT of stability when needed (100 CM for exemple).
---
But I personnaly prefer running Auramancer + Chronomancer : a lot funnier in my point of view :) Here's a build I've shared if you want to test tempest, it's pretty strong and fun :
---

---
I also suggest you to go to the wiki and look for "equipment acquisition by stats" or "ascended equipement" in order to know what item could fill your need. As said earlier, now trinkets are easier to obtain.
---
You will get ascended armor via fractal daily dropping if you are lucky, or have to craft them.
---
Have a nice day
---
&gt; If you add a fourth meta lane
---
Who said it'd be tied to the meta or exploration?
---
As OP has said in a comment, there's...
---
&gt; an entire unused section in Caudecus Manor that remained hidden away until we revisited it in LWS3.
---
They could totally repurpose that area for telling some sort of side story in an instanced story zone that doesn't affect the meta at all. Gotta flex your imagination or you miss out on the possibilities.
---
Seen a fair few of these in the works. Congrats. It looks pretty elegant
---
1. Tons of people prefer to run with a healer (especially for chill runs). At the moment the heal meta option is firebrand paired with a renegade for alacrity.
---
2. Usually there is always a druid for spotter/spirits. A soulbeast can take its place but that is really done only if you're going without any healing (not the standard, imo).    The second healer can be whatever, depending on encounter and what people wants to play. I'm doing training with my guild and we used both a firebrand and heal scourge. 
---
3. Trinkets from S3 now have PoF stats on them so you can farm those and choose whichever you need. 
---
4. You can start in exotic and then usually get ascended trinkets &gt; weapons &gt; armor in that order. For armor you can also go for some stat selectable armors like the ones from reward tracks (PvP and WvW) or the one in Verdant Brink. You can also buy the lunatic armor recipes. For harrier I think there are also some PoF exclusive armors. I would advise aiming for at least rings/accessories and weapons in the right stat. 
---
For the berserker/heal problem I would say that for open world exotic is not necessary, especially armor. It is a nice boost though to run ascended weapons/trinkets but it's not mandatory at all.
---
P.S. You can get some ascended stuff as a drop from fractals. Mostly rings, but you might get lucky and get one with a decent stat (I got a harrier one for example). The higher you go the more chances you also have to get armor chests as well.
---
I tried the codes too. And yup they’re all gone. 😭
---
I think there's also one I'm the works for BlishHUD. Which is heavily in development
---
What's is blishHUD though? Is it an alternative taco?
---
Steve the ice wurm never hurt a gly.
---
Would not like GW3 probably. However it is possible to actually upgrade the engine of an older mmo, which in turn enables them to develop better graphics(this has been done, you know it). That way we would not have to depend on 3rd party addons to make this shit run smoothly on modern computers.
---
It's been over a month and you're *STILL* butt-blasted about this?
---
I feel like this only benefits people like me who like to stack everything on singular characters rather than having a heap of alts. I don't like to spread my gear and items out so this is great for me. But for most, it's easier and more efficient ( even cost effective ) to just have multiple alts.
---
Hmm good point.
---
&gt;You not only still don't understand the whole concept of whitewashing 
---
A.) You never actually explained what you think whitewashing is. So, for you to say that I "still" don't understand it, doesn't make sense. "Still" implies you explained it and I ignored it, when you didn't.
---
B.) [This is the definition from wikipedia. Both of them in fact.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxutuy/jormags_va_is_female/eyti9ha/)
---
I explained what whitewashing is, I even gave you a neutral source, and yet you still don't seem to understand the concept. Why is that?
---
&gt; whitewashing but also still maintain the illusion that i support it for some reason
---
If you don't support whitewashing, why do you want all cultures in tyria to have the values of western liberal democracies? 
---
In earlier coments I brought up the fact that [all cultures in tyria essentially share the same identical value system with little to no inter or outer conflicts or cultural clashes](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxutuy/jormags_va_is_female/eyqzc3k/), and you considered the fact that they are all homogenized/westernized a good thing.
---
&gt; I play when I feel like.
---
I am in the same boat, and this just does to play well with raids I suppose. Which is really a shame. I will not plan my life around a raiding. That's not too much to ask for, or is it?
---
I explained what whitewashing is, I even gave you a neutral source and explained how it applies, and yet you still refuse to understand the concept. Why is that?
---
Because patch time has been exactly the same since release.
---
War Eternal
---
But why would we return there? What value does a story instance add to anything?
---
And there we have it ladies and gentlemen, the kid with his mum's cc is doubling down :)
---
I can understand that. I think the same feeling ultimately brought me into Guild Wars. I played World of Warcraft for years. I remember the first year as a golden period in life. I was done with school, had a lot of time gaming. MMO were quite new back than and I had many friends who still played video games. With time people got more angry, and I felt like I'm doing the same thing over and over. I quit WoW. 5 years later, I wanted to have the same feeling I used to had when playing WoW - but I didn't want to come back to WoW again. This was the past, and I wanted to move forward. And that's how I ended in GW2. So maybe if you feel like that - you should start something fresh, because nothing probably will make you feel like things used to be, because that happens just once :-)
---
This is optimal for monetization, terrible compared to ARC templates.
---
I'm just gonna wait for another free add-on.
---
Not really, but this is just setting you up for disappointment if it doesn't happen. Nothing was announced except build templates, so don't expect anything else.
---
Played one week, loved the game. Supported development by getting PoF and Hot :-)
---
So I'm ready ;-)
---
Laughs in zerker build used for all content. You'll never beat me 0 clicks template.
---
&gt;EDIT: I will find the Discord that all people talk about... But God damn Raiding is already hard to get into and now we have this freaking secret Discord where you actually need to find and join out of game to get into it. Not mentioning the LI or KP to even get some recognition. If I didn't ask here Im just here thinking LFG raiding finder is just dead. Ty for info but this is really another fck up thing community is doing to Pug raiding. I'll try joining multiple raiding discord.
---
Yeah such an amazing secret discord: it is only like the first link on google if you write "guild wars 2 raid training" where you can find the open invite link. 
---
These discord are not some secret club. They are open community to help people learn without pugging since generally it is not pleasant experience. But you seem unable to appreciate even that. You seem to be criticizing the people willingness to form a community some kind a elitism. You need to lighten up a bit.
---
 Also if you want pugging you can always make an account on EU. Pug raiding is pretty much alive there although i would still suggest training discords.
---
Well export import function basically makes it free. You pay for convenient storage.
---
Maybe I was just lucky :P
---
Tiny human now, raid companion later on! :P
---
&lt;3
---
So who is your favorite waifu? :P
---
Oh that's awesome, I thought it would be much harder. Thanks!
---
Oh must of missed that, sorry. Thanks for pointing it out!
---
Playing ATM with strangers will result in questionable consequences too.
---
It is dead. 
---
Dead means they don't get any updates, it's dead content. 
---
Playing them is like trying to blow up some air into a skeleton.
---
This is exactly the reason why you use sub group settings that differ heavily from the 5/5 comp on organized groups. Like if you have a sub with 5 weavers 1 druid and 1 renegade so every of the weavers gets spotter and assasins presence at around 90%+ uptime whilst you would sort the 10 man quickness chrono or boonthief in a single sub.
---
There was something weird about the way Quiznos did it but I can’t remember the specifics.  I just remember the guy talking about how it was a problem for most of their stores trying to get orders.
---
Thank you for your reply!
---
Isn't radial just for using mounts? I currently have mounts bound to hot keys and working well enough for me. Why is radial worth it? Just to save hot keys?
---
Awesome! I hope you enjoy! Ranger is definitely a fantastic choice given your goals. The neat thing about guild wars 2 is no matter how simple you or others might think a class is, due to the combat system, there is a ton of depth and complexity if you really look into it. So although things can be very simple in the open world, you can always make things more interesting by using rotations and weapon swaps as you just mentioned :D
---
check it, if you find no people playing them, no lfg adverts, you can consider it dead.
---
Healbrand in fractals , you must be joking :)) ( heal in fractals is a waste of 5th player slot )
---
I think your comment sums this whole discussion up in a nice way. When Arena Net would get their heads out of the sand and just deliver content as they always promised, we wouldn't talk about cash grabbing. But not delivering content while also implementing new features that we need to pay for to use it efficient, never goes well with any community.
---
&gt;There are plenty of situations where you would want switch templates rather than characters.
---
Indeed there are. Problem is, there aren't enough template slots.
---
Dang. All the Quiznos in my area are closed
---
CS:GO and GW2 are CPU heavy games and especially about GW2 so what you care about more is single thread performance. A 3rd gen Ryzen should be more than fine for the Job. Also i would suggest to go a bit cheaper. Like the 3600 or the 3600x (if you do not want to fiddle with overclocking) and a 450 motherboard. 
---
If these are the only game you play mainly and you do not need the PC for non gaming work getting a 3700x is a bit of a waste. The 3700x is basically a 3600x with more core. If you do not have a use for the extra cores it would be useless for you. The 3600x should give you the exact same experience. 
---
Also the 1660ti is absolutely fine for both games and for any modern game for 1080p resolution and sometimes for 1440p.
---
And also "Remember the superior system, that we already had in GW1 for FREE!"
---
For starting (so to learn mechanics) go for a power dps and condi dps. There are plenty of choices including using warrior with different builds.
---
There are obviously less pug groups when the amount of raiders able to make and fill these groups continues to decline.
---
At some point lfg just becomes hopeless and abandoned. Similar to how wvw servers implode and gold players get close to top 250 in NA.
---
NA has always been less competitive than EU. It also doesnt have a clear primetime (more spread timezone) which makes lfg even more difficult. It's not surprising NA has next to zero activity for raids / pvp / wvw. 
---
If you want to see the future of EU, just look at NA. Because frankly that's where we are headed.
---
I would say 6 for now. I'm sure they will expand it more with higher demand.
---
Noice then you're way better rhen my irl best bud. 6 years and he still cant finish it alone xD
---
Someone needs to do a video like this and compare it to ArcDPS. XD
---
Whats your experience with the 5700 xt? I asked around in r/buildapc and people tend to not recommend the card when you play older games especially DX9 games?Also a lot of driver problems in general.
---
You will have to be in a keep to be able to swap builds, ANet said that during their btemplate stream.
---
Before discord it was TS and before it was mumble. What do you think DESO was using in the TT first kill. Gw2 always had such communities from the start. This is how MMOs always worked.
---
The real question is, does it work in PvP?
---
Can't argue about that lol
---
Nono, regular humans learn from past experiences. Casuals don't invest much time into the game.
---
In gw2, they simply dont want to or cannot learn. Thats why they drool. Completely mindless mashing buttons. Partly the games fault for never scaling upwards, altho many asked for it.
---
I dont care you wanna play like this. But the demands that groups take players like this who frankly refuse to learn or improve is absurd. The demand that all content should be made for them, and accessible for them, literally isnt workable and damages the game. 
---
You'll see in due time. Or you wont due to a lack of willingness or ability to learn. ;)
---
Sorry nobody in gw2 is superhuman. If you play extended periods of time, picking up things and improving is normal. Nothing super about it. That's why calling people who play high amounts and learn exceptionally little arent casual.
---
I mean yeah Discord may be the flavor of the times, but before Discord they used Teamspeak. And before then, Mumble. And so on and so forth. It doesn't change the fact that people who are serious about learning lategame content understand how awful PUG experiences can be and would much rather group together in a format that everyone can hear the Commander's orders and instructions and be able to... Communicate.
---

I need confirmation of not getting banned before using this tool.
---
You could also make use of the Candy Corn Vendor (Weekly) at the moment - the Tyrian Exchange Voucher will give you 300 of your required currency.
---
Well it'll change now that the clocks have changed in the UK. At least the release time in the UK will be at 4pm I believe.
---
&gt;They could also add PvP map packs. The maps currently in the game stay free, but then release a new pack of 5 maps every year you can buy.
---
Awful, awful idea. Have you never heard about "splitting the community"? How would it work in ranked? Did you even give this two seconds of thought?
---
Camel's back was already broken. Build templates was just ArenaSoft taking a shotgun to end our misery.
---
I'm stuck between either an ele or mesmer for T4s and raids.
---
For T4s, I plan to play either of the two classes as a power dps, whereas for raids, it can be either power or condi for the both of them (maybe even heal tempest for certain niche situations).
---
However, for now the complexity of weaver and the lack of burst for tempest kinda caused me to lean closer towards a power chrono for T4s... But I've read that mastering weaver opens up a metric ton of utilities which is pushing me back towards ele... What would you guys suggest? :)
---
I joined them with other person which is my waifu. LUL
---
Nah. ANet doesn't like rewarding skill, nothing to do with gold. Perhaps all whales are terrible at the game and take their oil baron wealth elsewhere if they ever fail.
---
&gt; And if you look really hard, like, really really hard, you'll find a face, pretty much anywhere.

Thank you for this :D
---
Structured pvp is what it's called in GW2 (5v5 conquest), to seperate it from wvw pvp. I've been a regular pvp player since release but never dipped my toes into wvw because I don't like the zerg/horde style pvp.
---
I’ve never even heard of Quiznos 😮
---
Don’t think they exist in Norway. Would love a code if you have any more ☺️
---
I think most people would agree with this. Vale guardian punishes you so hard if you miss a mechanic and there are so many opportunities to fuck up and have everyone die. Also the amount of times I join a group as a healer on vg doing no greens and someone walks away from me and into like 4 of those blue orbs that fly around get downed and finished off by the green blowing up. Gives me conniptions.
---
The idea behind condi druid in raids is. That u support gives some boons and do some dmg. Yeah it can work for the pvp context but it would not be optimale.
---
After the "big live announcement" fiasco the community was salty af. Grothmar Valley came and people felt a spark in the game. Maybe Anet could fulfill their promise and add an expansion level content with their new Saga structure. Then, build templates announced. The most anticipated feature everyone was asking since launch. For two weeks we gave him our sincerest feedback and they decided to blandly ignore us. Now I can freely say: FUCK YOU ARENA NET. YOU ARE BUT A BUNCH OF GREEDY ASSHOLES.
---
My account is cursed
---
While leveling don't bother with using transmutation charges. If you're super bothered by mis-matched armor you can pick up an outfit. You can pick up a town clothing tonic on the trading post for 93copper and can turn it into an outfit at an NPC by the trading post in Lion's Arch. That way you don't need to worry about running around like a mis-matched hobo. There's plenty of other outfits, but they're all in the gemstore and you don't need to worry about that for a little while IMO :) 
---
If you do WvW or PvP you will get transmute charges super easily and before long you have plenty that will keep you going for a loooong time. 
---
So yeah, it can feel a little wasteful using them while leveling up, but you'll be out of the leveling stage pretty quickly and can fully delve into the wonderful world of fashion wars once you're 80 :)
---
Just feeling, especially the warrior in right instead of Balthazar
---
They don't need to change the map instances, they would instance the new story, *maybe* add decorations to that instance that aren't visible outside of it and potentially add situationally appearing NPCs in the open world similar to how they've been making story modes for a while now.  
---
My own reading between the lines of dev statements over the years leads me to believe the code is full of issues caused possibly by careless or amature coders/designers which are then followed by boatloads of monkey patching... Too many issues in the most random of places start appearing when they go touching code from that far back.  So it would probably need to something on the level of rewriting every zone from the ground up to really fix stuff, and possibly a lot of engine work too which would be an undertaking so vast as to mean making GW3.  Which makes me sad.
---
What am I supposed to be looking at? Catalina support? End of collaboration with "GARO"? Anti-RMT actions?
---
come on that is just a stupid coincidence, so many game launchers do this and even done this kind of layout even before GW2 ;P
---
The thing is, coffers weren't selling. After the initial bump of price (which is about the same time as this post) ppl started to do the achievement and instaselling. You are still guaranteed of profit when ppl sell the coffer for ~60-70g and the price WILL rise after the event is over. Didn't really buy the whole white knighting.
---
Hey, are you from the PINK guild who usually provide EU JP portal service? Your daily help is very much helpful for the community, thanks guys 🙏🎉
---
Yes it is a stupid coincidence XD
---
The nightmare court appears in the Verdant Brink missions, represented by only a couple of NPCs who were also resisting Mordremoth's control.
---
They were used to signify that the "Nightmare" within the Dream isn't caused by Mordremoth.
---
Malyck didn't remember any dream, and awoke right after leaving the pod, meaning his tree didn't have a protective connection to the dream, and so it only made 'soundless' Sylvari, which are weaker to Mordremoth's power. So his tree was likely corrupted.
---
The combat actually slows you down, technically. And jump is tied to your speed. So even in combat, if you get speed buffs to cap your speed, you can jump same-ish distance (for example if you get superspeed buff).
---
But ye, getting out of combat makes you more in control and having good speed even without buffs. Same stufff can happen other way around, if you get swiftness in mid-jump, your jump will be longer and you can overshoot....happened so many times xD
---
-----------------
---
Well, many perceived it as blind jumps but most of places do have at least some hints. But well...
---
That mini better become available in some other way that isn't pure RNG, like the mini ticket.
---
Try to find other non-rushers and form a guild of people who take their time and have lots of patience.
---
That's some fantastic fashion wars.
---
I do think VG is a good learn boss though. It teaches mechanics and is less of a DPS golem like Cairn or MO.
---
NO horsie, ONLY dolyaks!
---
&gt;Then I remembered why I stopped playing. I was trying to get a legendary weapon. It required me to do a bunch of raids and fractals to the point it got me frustrated. So then I took a break for a while, but didn't come back.
---
&gt;I hated having to be in groups.
---
There may be some mixup here. You say you were playing before the first expansion, Legendaries from that era did not require Raids or Fractals, raids didn't even exist.
---
Fractals are required for some of the newer collections, but are all doable at tier 1 with virtually no experience.
---
I've been through the death of at least 8-10 "static" groups since raids began and with the last group fizzle I just stopped raiding. I do need to get some more LI at some point to finish another set of legendary armor, but right now I don't feel up to searching for another group.
---
I do weekly key farms at different times every week.
---
There's lots of people mondays, because there's other people doing key farm, but at any other day of the way, with any other story path and race, there's always lots of starting players.   Low AP, no guild, low or no masteries, etc...
---
I also do a daily map completion, and there's always new players around too, even when the map doesn't have daily achievements.   
---
I haven't seen so many people all over the place for quite a long time.
---
Maybe it isn't the same in NA, but in EU it's clearly not falling behind when it comes to new players. And as long as there's players, there will be development to get them to spend cash in gems.
---
I think a big problem that also leads to your question is how, in comparison, GW2s and other MMOs updates are being perceived.
---
From my point of view, other MMOs like WoW or FF14 have huge updates but only every few years with very little in between. GW2 has a scheduled content flow each few months and maybe even less now with the Saga. Just the amount of content you get from Living world episodes was IMO more than any of the Expansions.
---
Then you have to look at how those games are structured. WoW is about pushing the boundaries of the level cap with each release by increasing it and adding new armour and content to get them. The whole incentive is to get that new item and farm for it until you get it. GW2 is in that regard very different because you don't need the best gear to do that.
---
you also have to look at the resources for the game, WoW has more than 10 times more employees and they have a subscription-based model while GW2 has not.
---
Since this form is constantly misunderstood as "white knighting" I'm not excusing ArenaNets behaviour but rather try to explain while comparing different MMOs to each other is not the best thing you should do.
---
Build templates is a mechanic that is being used and it will be used but those things are not what keep players playing. At some point, the first episode of the saga will release and hopefully, they will release a new Raid wing and fractal soon.
---
What keeps players engaged, is the content they like. Be that Living world, PvP, WvW, Fractals, Raids or whatever and any addition to that will give players something to do. It is just that ArenaNet needs to deliver in those areas in a more consistent schedule so that this part of the community isn't neglected for quite some time.
---
Welcome aboard commander !
---
I started playing 7 years ago and keep coming back. Best MMO + community of the decade
---
You forgot the "⸮".
---
Back when u had 4 wings people pugged a lot more, the overall difficulty was much easier and there was much less role distribution, basically tank and healer carried 100% responsibility. Pug groups have been abandoned a lot since w5 came out, not only because a lot of hardcore raiders left but also because all new wings (regardless of their difficulty) put a lot of personal mechanics on everyone.
---
Take Qadim for example, u need pulls/pushes, portals if the group is up for it, boonstrip, coordination, splitting. Then u need 1 person to tank wyvern/destroyer/patriarch and another to tank matriarch at the end while people need to be assigned for lamp.And then u have the kiter who basically can wipe the group instantly if he fucks up. If anything of these fails its an insta-wipe. Qadim is ridiculously ez for an experienced group that abuses portals,chrono focus pulls, thieves, renegade alacrity for huge burst,spellbreaker bubble etc but for an inexperienced or casual group it becomes a hurdle, a big one. With this in mind most people atm only pug w1-w4 which are simple and straightforward and do the rest with a static or friends, or do fullclear with them and completely avoid lfg.
---
Already has. Anet management is either completely delusional and thinks living story will keep this game going, or they know the game is dying and just want to squeeze some short term profit out of the remaining whales who invested too much to quit.
---
Either way GW2 has no future.
---
I had a similar story with WoW but on again, off again for years. 
---
I’ve had a long love affair with GW2 as well, and when I’d get bored between releases, I’d make [cinematic videos with the UI turned off](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWK_o49IupRe1EZubnZfs0w), to highlight the art and music of the game.  I’ll still come back for the story releases and maybe that will rekindle things for me. 
---
Have fun in your new game!  There’s lots of great stuff ahead of you!
---
&gt; play it all purely solo
---
Afaik only WoW allows you to do that, as long as it's not current content, that is you can solo everything including all raids of previous xpacs when new ones come out and you level and gear up.
---
They even change old raids mechanics to allow them to be soloable and put buffs that apply to you when you enter a raid solo and you're over a given level threshold, I'm not aware of any other game doing the same.
---
well you can play gw2 pvp only since after hitting 10 with a character you can just make any character, finish the first mission and pop into PVP at max level with everything unlocked minus some runes/sygils.
---
Hey there! Welcome to GW2 :) I'll be adding you when I get home - I've been playing the game since it's release, so if you have any questions/concerns, don't be afraid to ask!!
---
you can also kidnap 9 people , buy accounts for them, order them to grind for endgame gear, then to learn rotation on their classes, form a squad with them, easy kill.
---
I can almost never find a group to do Arah. I've only ever found one and it was “led” by two extremely toxic people with no patience for people who weren't familiar with it. Even when I join a dungeon tour, they don't do Arah.
---
ded gaem

This subreddit is exactly the opposite audience for what you're saying. Players like you are in the game and don't interact with out-of-the-game community, often for the same very reasons, and the most competitive players are here and will laugh at you for not wanting to "grow a spine", "man up", "git gud" and so on.
---
You have your own life and priorities, they have their own; but in GW2, it is possible to minimize those interactions and still receive a lot from the game playing alongside calm, solo-focused players like you, so if you're still into it - push on, since if you don't want a fully single player experience, then GW2 is likely still the best thing out there.
---
If you never leave the PvP lobby then it already exist.
---
You could mention if you are EU or NA...
---
What does that even mean ? 
---
Openworld PvP ? 
---
What about waypoints, how are the fsctions split, are there safezones, what about Meta and world Events 
---
Or the PvP as a seperate game ? Since the Game is FTP and you can Join pvp instantly i guess thats already that
---
This Game is so much Not build around that, that without a way deeper more defined proposal of what you mean ther's realy No way to answer you.
---
Nope. Rules of the internet have to be applied.
---
When trying to determine the meaning of an acronym, you always have to use the most sexually charged possible that fits in the context.
---
Yes. You can definitely play only PvP here.
---
I wouldn't mind it being cut out of GW2 and made a separate game so that its balance finally stops messing with PvE.
---
I think I have a 6-month-old reshade build.
---
Sorry for being reasonable. If I want to raid and there is no squad for my desired wing I just open a squad instead of complaining about a dead lfg.
---
As a guardian i have:
---
Berserker scholar (power DPS)
---
Grieving/sinister/viper (condi DPS)
---
Berserker thief w/some diviner (power quickness)
---
Viper (condi quickness)
---
Harrier (heal)
---
Minstrel (heal for WvW/fractals when instas are hard)
---
And i still don't have room for a pve open world build (with firework runes).
---
r/whoosh
---
ANET marketing is just a meme at this point... kung fu tea... AHHHH...
---
While there is a lot to be said about GW2's features and support for guild finding, not being willing to spend a few minutes looking for and applying for a guild to vastly improve your experience getting into raiding is a shoddy excuse, let's be fair. Raiding is the sort of content you will want to do with friends and guildies, and you won't find any hopping between LFGs.
---
I mean wouldn´t a pvp only game have a better way to balance things and to put more work in it if you don´t have to put 99% of the work in pve?
---
Just a thought...
---
Another question: Is there a game that is similar to gw2 combat system?
---
Thx for information!
---
Even though rangers have no place in a zerg, they are quite common as roamers.
---
&gt; I gather that there was an Arc addon/app people were using that was free and that was faster/better, and now Anet blocked it or broke it or something (not sure honestly?); but what makes this specific system so bad?
---
ANet allowed an add-on, that added gear and skill templates to the game with the caveat, that it would have to be disabled again, once they implemented their own version.
---
Their own version is a bit limited in options for veteran players and is monetized in the same way every other convenience option is in GW2.
---
ANet made the mistake to allow the add-on, which raised expectations. If they simply hadn't allowed the add-on, there would be no outrage.
---

If you have a free account, you can sell some stuff at the Black Lion Trading Company, but not most things... i could sell weapons i crafted but not food, and not a lot of stuff that dropped. It is very hard to earn gold without at least an expansion.

At the moment in Lions Arch is the Candy Corn Vendor (Weekly) who will exchange candy corn cobs or the voucher. Details here -  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Candy\_Corn\_Vendor\_(Weekly)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Candy_Corn_Vendor_(Weekly))

&gt;From my point of view, other MMOs like WoW or FF14 have huge updates but only every few years with very little in between. GW2 has a scheduled content flow each few months and maybe even less now with the Saga. Just the amount of content you get from Living world episodes was IMO more than any of the Expansions.
---
What? are you like ignorant?
---
FF14 just got a big patch 5.1 today following their expansion from july, this patch brought continuation on the story that brought a new dungeon, a new extreme trial, a new alliance raid, balance changes to classes, rework to how crafting works to make it less annoying, some minor overall tweaks and in 2weeks they'll release a new ultimate. 
---
Then in 3months they'll release 5.2 which brings another continuation to the story, 4 new raid bosses and some other stuff and 2weeks after that the savage versions will land.
---
FF14 has literally triple the content every 3months compared to gw2. GW2 is fucking dying for proper new content that is amazing, and every game has exploring maps and achievement in the end so I dont include that as content.
---
They did require doing dungeons (or PvP when reward tracks were implemented), so at least they're correct in that it required some form of group interaction. Either that or endlessly open-world farming to get enough money to buy the precursor/legendary.
---
I get what they (and you) are saying as well. I don't mind grouping for fractals, but I don't raid. I don't like partying for open-world content or story content because I like playing at my own pace. However, I do enjoy the social interaction of talking while doing an activity myself; I just don't want to leave people hanging if I have to go, or hold people up because I prefer playing content at a specific pace.
---
I'd rather believe a GW2 overhaul is more realistic than a brand new game. They could create a new engine that would run on multi-cores and dx12 and port every account to the new game. But at this point, nobody would like a new game, especially those that have almost everything unlocked in the game.
---
Programmer: Oh my, you are right. Something must be off!
---
Project manager: It's not a bug, it's a feature:
---
The different physical weights exert a different amount of gravitational force onto your shoulders, this being translated to a slightly different bone posture, which in turn affects the angle of the weapon in your hand a bit. Just be amazed by the realism...
---
You interpreted correctly and would have been better served simply by asking a question. 
---
Of course there is a difference between arc and the official implementation. Arc didn't store gear in a separate inventory, the official  templates do and people using ascended gear get more out of that with both fashion QoL and effective bag space.
---
I wouldn't promote free transmutes as that makes legendary far, far too valuable. Saving fashion to the build template independently of gear would be nice though for legendary items.
---
This isn't so much a coding thing as it is a rigging thing. Yes, deep down there is code in the feature, but, you can't blame that.
---
When an artist creates an armor piece, it is their responsibility to make sure the bones are mapped correctly for animation as well as compatibility with other armor pieces and weapons.
---
I'm speculating that there are flags for back mounted weapons and hip mounted weapons and that shoulders take priority due to the fact that they tend to be over other armors. So any accidental flagging for affecting hip weapons on the shoulders is going to overwrite the leggings.
---
Sometimes I wish this was a moddable singleplayer game, because I would love to take a stab at fixing the compatibility issues on as many of my favorite armors as possible. No deadline, no budget, just fun.
---
FFXIV has an auto queue system for normal raids that automatically groups you with other players. LFG in that game is only used for the equivalent of challenge motes.
---
The point is though, you shouldn’t have to leave the game for that; it should be built in.
---
I'd dare say objectively, game mechanics-wise, also the best. Just lacking a bit in the comms/marketing dept. and frequency of updates with meaningful content. Sadly, the latter is the important part to ensure the longevity of an MMO.
---
Yeah, but even League of Legends went back through their spaghetti and untangled at least some of it. GW2 seems to ignore/add onto it.
---
Dyes are free, so if you want to look better while leveling dyeing your armor is a good way to go.

Oh believe me i plan on it :)

\*mind blown\*
---
Here is a problem (that likely there isn't much of a solution for) aside from what has already been posted... 
---
take a quick look at just about every recruitment post in gw2recruitment sub where raiding is mentioned. 
---
Almost every single one wants to clear at daily reset +/- 30 minutes or at weekly raid reset. Meaning if you can't make that time, you are going to have a bad time.. if this is at all representative of the entire raiding community, there will basically be next to nothing on LFG 90-95% of the time.
---
My comment does nothing of the sort. It notes that a major feature being advertised doesn't work with legendary items. Which is entirely truthful and accurate.
---
You jumped to a conclusion instead of asking for clarification.
---
My bad
---
Because you can oneshot noobs. Every veteran can outplay a ranger roamer.
---
She went to live with some hippie charr.
---
Its honestly not that bad personally i wish the actual gameplay achievements needed were actually challenging
---
If you are willing to put some investment to hamming in general you could go for a left-handed mouse and a right-handed gamepad.
---
I'm right handed so I can't really give you specific advice, but my setup is mouse+gamepad (so much better than a keyboard), which I know for a fact you can buy left handed versions (or neutral).
---
Lol They filed for bankruptcy in 2014. Why does Anet think they would make a good promotional partner? Why are they so bad at choosing these places?

Riot makes 2 billion a year, ArenaNet makes 50 million a year. See the difference.
---
Damn, this is pretty close to the design I'm working on. Once I've finished this (for portfolio), would you be open to collaboration/pull requests if I have things to improve your tool?
---
This is so true that it hurts
---
So do I understand this correctly: in this campaign you get an exclusive mini which cannot be obtained any other way? This campaign is limited to an american fast food chain, so any non-US-player is simply sool?

1.8k li here, what is the RA discord?

Send me a pm. I've felt rushed going through dungeons and keep wishing I could run them at social speeds. I've got a good friend who can join us for some slow dungeons. It's social, but you won't be rushed. Can probably find a few others too.
---
&gt; Just because it worked fine for you doesn't mean it didn't have issues elsewhere. 
---
That wasn't meant to cancel out what you said in some way. I shared my experience as you shared yours. People wanted to install it. I'm not sure what the "technically malware" point has to do with this, since, as you said, people installed it out of their own free will _and_ it was allowed by Chris Cleary / ANet.
---
&gt; It takes 3 purchases of GW2 PoF to recover the cost of 1 hour of 1 dev's time.
---
Well thank god that isn't the only thing they're selling then. Almost every player you see running around is using mount skins, outfits, gemstore skins. ANet wouldn't be on the edge of going bankrupt just for not monetizing build templates.
---
If they would've monetized this just a bit less aggressively - locking it behind an expansion, selling account / class unlocks instead of character unlocks, not splitting it into 3 different parts making you pay for all 3 seperately (with one of them honestly being unnecessary), monetizing the "gear vault" instead of making us pay to save strings that can be saved locally on your machine - anything like that and a massive part of the complaints just wouldn't exist. But they decided to go foe the greedy option, while
---
&gt; ANet is bound to their entire player base
---
 also screwing over people with legendary gear and the very audience you'd expect for a feature like this, leaving behind a part of their playerbase.
---
I am not really active anymore, but every time I feel the need to play GW2, I open up beginner friendly dungeon groups. They are always full within one or two minutes and its great fun to not rush through them like you normally do.
---
Had someone in my AC team last week who just recently played GW1 and it was so cool seeing him nerding out about all of the bosses in story mode. (For people who don't know this. All bosses with exception of Adelbern are skill trainer in GW1 Proph pre-searing.) Especially when we reached the lovers event and he was like "I did everything for them in GW1... Nice to see that they are still together!"
---
tbf you're also obligated to pay \~$150+ a year for those big mmorpgs, and every expansion is designed to invalidate player progression of the last expansion.
---
GW2 just has a different business and player progression model. Not saying it's the right model or a good model, but every time I see a comparison to content in FFXIV or WoW no one ever brings up the other important differences between them.
---
I've always just used the number pad. The few times I've played some games that forced me to used WASD was just very uncomfortable. It varies by the game, but for GW2 I use 8, 4, 5 &amp; 6 for direction, 9 for jump, 1, 2 &amp; 3 for utility skills, Enter for Elite. Del for Interact, +, -, * &amp; / and 7 for Class Skills (ie F1 to F5). I don't have an MMO mouse, but I did get an ambidextrous one (Logitech G300s) that has some programmable buttons which I use for weapon skills. Heal is still on space bar because it's huge and I can't miss it when I need it. Not sure what I have Numpad Insert set to, but in most other games it's crouch. Griffon is on Mouse 3, and the others are on Ctrl+1-4 or Shift+M3.
---
your statement was:
---
And then you also said:
---
&gt;I use the word "incentivize" actually, it's neutral
---
So yes, your issue very much so was that the term pressure can't be used neutrally.  My argument is it can.
---
Somehow worse for me is:
---
Pull 1 - 50% wipe
---
Pull 2 - 25% wipe
---
Pull 3 - 5% wipe
---
Then 1 leaves, and 6 others follow.
---
Start looking into fractals of the mists, build your ascended set of equipment, and once you start doing tier4 fractals you get a solid amount of daily gold with not a lot of effort/time.
---
I would agree Mesmer is a bit of a pain to level. I did 1-80 on a Mesmer and it felt like it took longer than any other profession I've leveled.
---
Events are the best xp and usually the most fun way to go. Basically everything gives you xp though, so wandering around and following your nose is a perfectly valid way to go too if you prefer that!
---
Hearts tend to be located in spots that have frequent events, so they kind of act as hubs. There are plenty of events in other spots too though. Completing maps is another great way to go.
---
Another lesser known way to get xp is to kill enemies in out of the way spots. The longer an enemy is alive in the world the more bonus xp it accrues. So basically if you kill something people don't usually kill you get a hefty chunk of bonus xp on top of the normal amount. It can go up to a significant increase!
---
why do you have 40 accounts, i can barely do shit on one
---
And inexcusably, 7 years of unfixed bugs and counting.
---
You can always farm for the mat from high level creatures that drop them (i.e. bats for blood), but it's pretty inefficient. Could also get volatile magic and buy trophy shipments
---
Raid population is apparently bleeding numbers due to people reaching their perceived goals and new content releases bringing back less and less people, making it not realistic to continue developing this kind of content from dev perspective (too little gain for too much dev time and costs). Heavily caused by solved meta and little to no replay incentives. Content also takes too much time to develop compared to community needs.
---
Map rewards and fractals is how I get them
---
i dont think we even have those in my country?
---
It’s a bit inconsistent to farm them. The best is probably dragonfall farming. Doing this you get volatile magic to buy trophy shipments. You will get a decent amount of t6 from those + while farming dragonfall. You also make gold and get lots of t5 while doing this which you can upgrade. Essentially this combines all the best methods for getting t6 in one go.
---
&gt; Shen wants to have a word with you.
---
That thread only indicates that Shen was banned from competitive for nearly 3 months. 3 months is a far cry from "years."
---
This statement is wrong on too many levels in MMO case.
---
Does magic find affect the drops? And can I get decent volatile magic from Icebrood Saga? I don’t have LW4
---
Actually your right. Ranked games are solo/duo only. So raids can be played this way too.
---
The true raiding experience
---
how do you even get 200 of them what
---
You are right on one side, and wrong on the other. Yes, you pay monthly for the other games, generating more revenue that can be put back into development. (If this really happens, is a different discussion.)
---
BUT, it is also a fact that GW2's earnings was always peaking when a new Expansion released. First with HoT and later PoF. And from then on, the monthly revenue started to dwindle. We had now already 2 years between the last peak and now, with a constant decline every quarter. Imaging what happens another 2 years down the line after LW5 ends if there is no new peak in sight in form of a new expansion. And the much bigger question is: Will anyone even care about a new expansion 2 or 3 years from now?
---
It all comes down to LW5 and how Arena Net delivers on their promises. And up until now, with only the Prologue live and no information when Episode 1 releases or insight on stuff like Elite specs, new fractals, new raids and other promised features, its not really looking good.
---
Fractal CMs are a much better form of endgame, change my mind
---
You need lw4 I think. At the least u can get the last chapter and buy volatile magic gathering tools (where you gain it as u gather nodes).
---
MF does help those drops ya
---
&gt; I said I dont include it as content because every single game that has open world has exploration and achievements, so imo those aren't worthy to be called content especially for MMO's where exploring is a good chunk of the experience.
---
So, just because every shooter has weapons in it it also isn't a game?
---
&gt; Money isn't the reason why Anet failed to deliver an expansion at the time we needed an expansion, the only reason we got this SAGA instead of expansion is because anet had a lot of internal problems with a horrible workflow and badly moving people to other projects and as a result had to scrap their expansion and salvaged some parts to start the icebrood saga what we have now.
---
My point with this was that it is easier to deliver the content with big updates when you have the resources to spend on it. A smaller team with less money to spend will not be able to release as much as a large team with more money. And that also includes the business model since WoW and AFAIK FF14 both have a subscription-based business model in which you also have to pay for the base game + expansions (if they are not included as WoW does it) and both WoW and FF14 have microtransactions. GW2 only has the game at a very low price which now includes everything, the living world episodes which can be neglected and also microtransactions. That is a huge difference.
---
&gt; Also you started with comparing these games, you said GW2 has more content every 3 months than WOW/FF14.
---
I did not, I said "than the expansions" which was directed to the GW2 expansions and not the expansions of the other games.
---
&gt; And FYI, expansions are way, way better for content and longitivety of playerbase than minor story every 4months.
---
I completely disagree, I wouldn't want to wait 2 years to spend 2 weeks to play the game and get bored of it as it was with HoT and PoF. But you know what, we don't have to agree on everything.
---
Same here, as a full WvW player, being able to change build and gear in less than one second will be usefull. (Swithing from support to dps staff to destroy a mortar ou swithing to a roamer build when the com ask for someone to cap a camp) 
---
With arc-dps even if it was possible, it was far mor risky because you could easily get into combat in a middle of a build switch.
---
There are a lot of cons to the templates but there are pros to and I try to focus on this hopping that Anet will improve the system in the (not too far) future.
---
You're missing context and ignoring nuance. "Pressure" can be used neutrally. It can also not be. In this case, it was not, because it was not used truthfully (or at least, in a way that was unquestionably truthful, whereas it's unquestionable that car dealers use tactics that can be described as "pressure". 
---
"Incentivize" is, as far as I can tell, almost impossible to say in any way except neutrally. Hence my original statement. 
---
Now if you're quite done trying to "gotcha" me, I'm pretty sure you are not entitled to any more of my time.
---
Yeah, that was the idea, you are right. Getting more supply. Yet that doesnt mean ive bought em expensive (as your 1st stated). This way i profit, as well as ppl who otherwise douldnt have done that achievment profit as well. Its a win/win in my eyes.
---
Thank you:D that’s real helpful

He was enable on july of the same year, probably the longest a champion was ever disabled from pro play.

---
&gt;Never mind doing the fight as intended which is an absolute breeze.
---
What, effience? Fuck that! Nah, we try bursting for 30min so we can save 1 minute of fighting properly! And then we try and fail skipping for another 10min so we can save 2 minutes of walking!

Steve is the Tuxedo Mask in this sailor moon series.

match maker in pvp actually tries to mirror the classes though, it is not only pure ranking.

However as nearly any class can play any role, this is useless for raids xD

Join us in WvW. You will be dirt poor, but you will never need transmute charges again!

Everyone in tier 3 doesn't know mechanics

Just because it’s challenging/difficult doesn’t mean it’s fun.

It works like that in Strike missions so far. It does have effect on speed and convenience of clear, but the mission is quite easy so far that it does nto make that big difference....probably will change with release of next step of this Strike...
---
They're getting murdered in the tweets and 100% deserve it.
---
&gt; match maker in pvp actually tries to mirror the classes though, it is not only pure ranking.
---
is that still the case though? I thought they removed a bunch of restrictions like profession stacking to allow faster matchmaking... I wouldn't be surprised if that would also be the case for profession mirroring since this would be a thing that could keep you hours in the queue
---
&gt;Maybe. My main's a Ranger, which I understand means I'd probably play a Druid in a raid. That's a complete respec for me.
---
Not necessarily. Ranger has viable condi and power builds as soulbeast. That's the beauty of this game... any class can play multiple wildly different builds.
---
Yes, but it still makes money.
---
Condi Mirage and Boon Chrono are super fun to play in T4s. I haven't done ele a whole bunch so I can't compare the 2.
---
And another 5 million lines of another scripting language.
---
Yeah, crazy.

man Pre searing is awesome! I'm glad they had fun with that!

---
Fractal CMs are done by even less people
---
Man its crazy how you can be in a group that will wipe that miniboss in less than a min, or get in another one where you spend 3/4 of the fractal just trying to kill it.
---
Alternatively, there is a lot of people who, when they fail a mechanic, immediately leave because they rather leave on their own terms than be bossed by tyrannical perfectionist commanders.
---
Ooh, hello build templates!
---
Stay salty :P
---
&gt; New Equipment Template Expansions are available in the Upgrades section of the Gem Store for 500 gems each.

New Build Template Expansions are available in the Upgrades section of the Gem Store for 300 gems each.

New Build Storage Expansions are available in the Upgrades section of the Gem Store for 500 gems. Each Build Storage Expansion comes with three spaces.
---
Hahaha i fk know it this sh*t is so fk overpriced, sad what has EAnet become the last year
---
i would argue there is not much difference if you run around the early maps as lvl 80 or as lvl 10.
---
The game is horrible in teaching you how to play. There are no real tutorials. I wouldn't even count the dodging thingy as tutorial.

&gt; For a limited time, the Permanent Scarecrow Finisher and Permanent Mad King Finisher return to the Style category of the Gem Store for 500 gems each

I have enough off those to make them seem permanent, but I am still waiting for that "Consume All" option.

Less than expected, more than it should be.
---
Aren't bag slots only character bound? It seems to imply that if I can only buy 6 in total so is that not 6 per character? 
---
I'll probably have to check this out in game to see if it's literally 6 per account.
---
I'm a bit confused and can't check right now - what is the difference between a build storage expander and a build template expander?
---
Getting 24 account-bound build slots requires six purchases. 1800 gems.
---
Getting all equipment loadouts requires another four purchases. 2000 gems.
---
Ignoring the character-specific build slots, this feature is yours for the absolute bargain of 3800 gems, or nearly $50 USD. That's assuming you don't change characters, of course. If you do that, you gotta pay up for the gear loadouts on the other character.
---
Disgusting.
---
i could honestly tolerated these prices if they were accountwide.  
---
but 30€ **per character**?!
---
Bag slots and gear templates are both character-specific.

Templates are the codes that arrange everything, storage is the slots for equipment.

Nice to see some early access stuff

I wish!  Then I'd turn off the stuff my tempest ele says every time she dismounts!

You play T3 to farm AR for T4 ...

Also people in T4 don't know the mechanics either, since a druid + hb negate all damage anyways.

T3 is an experience.  It's where all the GW2 optimization naysayers go to get drunk, watch netflix and spike eachother's drinks.
---
Patch size is about 167 MB for those interested
---
Yes, but it says I can buy up to 6, so I'm not sure if that means buying one can only be used on a single character or you can buy at most 6 from the store and that unlocks a tab for each character you have.
---
By itself, you won't see more than two people from one profession in *ranked* matches, and if possible, it really tries to do mesmer vs mesmer etc. At least that's what observation is. 
---
However there is no barrier to people relogging and running something different and even stacking classes that way. Many times people relogged and there were like 3-4 necros instantly...probably not happening anymore with scourge being killed. xD Also one can cheese this by queueing on one class and expecting that other team will have this same class, then relog to other class that counters the previous one...but can be really gamble and easily can go wrong :)
---
$6.25 for an equivalent of 3 chat links. What a joke. Even 100 gems would be arguably too high for that value of a service.
---
It's per character.
---
Build template expander is another build template slot for your character. Build storage expander is more space to store builds in your account-wide "build bank".
---
Lefty here, did you ever seen any right-handed gamepad?
---
LOL
---
Let the reddit shot show begin
---
Equating the feature price to the absolute upper bounds of possible slots is a baffling false equivalence to me.
---
Worst thing are the groups that burst the slime down to 10%, but instead of doing that and then killing 1 single big health-slime to win, they continue to try and burst over and over again. Had 3 of those in a row once. It was... exhausting.
---
No it's not. The upper bound is still less than what we got with Arcdps. Lmao.
---
Well, it's only approx $400 to max out 9 characters....
---
Build Templates are per-character.  Build Storage is account-wide.
---
Build Storage is how you can move a build in-game from one character to another of the same class, or where you'd copy someone else's linked build to save when you're not playing the same class they are.  The Build Templates are the actual hotkey shortcuts where an individual character can equip a new build with the press of a button.
---
Oh. That storage expander seems super worthless lol
---
I keep thinking it's backwards, this whole thing is so intentionally obtuse, I swear.
---
Wow.  Anet did nothing with feedback.  And the price.... What a joke.
---
i was able to craft it two days ago

Well, you can do that, there's a "Player chatter slider" in the options menu you can turn off.  I'm just not sure if it applies to Revenant legends, as they aren't exactly the player.
---
only care about equipment templates. any gear items can be shared more than 1 equipment templates is good news for me
---
They put a lot of time and resources into build templates. They originally said they wouldn't do it because it was so much work. 
---
Now they've done it, and y'all just keep complaining about the price. We don't pay a monthly fee and we get to enjoy the game. People need to suck it up.
---
That’s not true.
---
If I loaded a build in gw1 it simply left a slot free if I didn’t have the skill unlocked and notified me that my char doesn’t meet the reqs for the build.
---
If arc didn’t find an item it just didn’t load it.
---
i mean at that price 30% would be a steal

GW2 content in a nutshell.
---
More interesting part FOR ME!  
---
Remember a tweet about 100k build made (ofc it takes 3-5 builds PER DAY)  
---
Now, lets see this live patch build number: 99835!  
---
Soo, our developers simply not so far from live in process of "making ideas to actual content". That's frightening
---
Don't understand Nazi, translate please
---
I feel sad hearing you say it so matter-of-factly. Thanks for everything you do anyway, that_shaman &lt;3
---
Fuck you twice over anet this was a shitty move.
---
I cannot stress this enough FUCK YOU!
---
That could just in case they don't get the patch out in 2 weeks. If they feel they can they will likely put some of those gemstore items in the patch in 2 weeks.
---
At 25€/2000gems, thats only 53.687.091,19€. 
---
By Ogden's Hammer, what savings!
---
The meaning of the term Build Template varies across Online Games, but as a general it means a system that saves your current skill/talent selection and-or equipped gear, allowing you to change those things instantly/on-the-fly without having to individually select each piece.
---
GW2 players have been waiting for this feature (which is a basic, free staple of MMO going back nearly 2 decades now) for *seven years*. For a while, they had it through an add-on called ArcDPS Templates: a spinoff of a player-made DPS mod that allowed you to instantly change your gear and build without having to select everything piece by piece. It was free, had no limit on number of builds, was quick and honestly worked extremely well for a fanmade mod!
---
ArenaNet finally announced they would be making their own version of this oft-desired feature... and to say the least, botched it. The number of builds you can have is extremely limited, the swapping is clunky, UI poor and it costs as much as a brand new character slot to get ONE new armor template + skill template (for reference, a new character gets 3 skill templates and 2 armor templates baseline, so you're literally losing money). Features from the *free add-on* are missing, and they want players to pay for it.
---
Worth noting: GW2 had skill templates as a baked in feature for zero cost.
---
Players are rightfully pretty miffed because not only is it absurdly over-monetized, it's worse than what we had... and something that every MMO does already but better and free.
---
I, and a lot of people I know, had more than the max number of templates here with arc, for free. Then ANet took them away, and now we have to pay some \~$300 (since I don't really care about Build Storage) to get back a fraction of the templates we had.
---
"when they fail a mechanic"
---
"bossed by tyrannical perfectionist commanders"
---
Uh... Sure, blame the commander because the member failed the mechanic and chose to leave.
---
Equipment, OK. 
---
But fucking build templates? Cmon. They offer nothing in storage value.
---
You know that "feedback" is just for show and tell with Anet, they dont actually want your feedback, they just want you to believe that they want your feedback.
---
this is why i dont raid. and never learned to. its scary already and then being required to depend on a bunch of other people to not be assholes is a tall task.
---
Haha, no way, if server stability was an issue, every class wouldn't have the option to drop several overlapping damage fields and effectively dump 50 hits in 2 seconds. 
---
People swapping gear in 1 second instead of 10 is a fraction of the load of damage calculations, and is way less frequent.

To be fair I hunk the crafting licences are buy 1 and every character gets a slot

How so? How bad is it? I am working right now and pretty much in the same situation as you.
---
Yes, they should be. 
---
And yes, they wont be. Anet was pretty clear on their stance of not giving a fuck and EAger to get some money.
---
It is! Wiping with an eye towards learning and improving, anyway.
---
&gt; because of server stability

You believe this?

So, right clicking on build storage crashes the game... Whelp.

Can't wait for them to patch the shop graphic to not show a character sitting on the chair.
---
Thank you, I'm taking that.
---
Well looks at the game now, I've got disconnected like 10 times already:-P I won't pretend that I understand their database design, just saying what was said to me.
---
If you buy them, consider the package for 2000 gems, that is worth  2x500 + 2x300 + 500 = 2100, plus boosters and makeover kit.
---
Also, can get only inventory tabs and keep the build templates in notepad and just import quick, that is free and iunlimited...
---
Also, they cost same as outfits and actually aren't useless compared to those outfits so yea, vote with wallet.
---
It's a way to store your current gear and skill setup, and quickly load back to it at later time. It's good because a lot of people run many different builds. It's bad because the feature is both character bound and expensive, meaning you will have to unlock new slots on each character if you want more than 2 (for gear) or 3 (for skills).
---
Which is why they should have made a proper build templates system similar to arc templates rather than the laughably limited and over-monetized “slots” system we are getting. They seriously had a perfect example of what everyone wanted, yet they choose to reinvent the wheel anyway because $$$.

I said previously  that the total cost would be about 1000 gems, and got downvoted for it, now the total is around 1300 gems, i personally havent bought anything from the TP for 6+ months now, and dont intend to invest into this either, the only way you can get your point across is to not spend the $ on it, aslong as you keep giving them a reason to price gouge everything on the TP they will continue to do it, nothing would get the point across faster to them than people not investing in it.

I dont have any female chars, would you be willing to take a screenie on norn?
---
Actually, it is because monetizing content is just less pure profit. Think about it, content takes time and effort, more time and more effort than cosmetics or qol, their margins on this are insane, this is why microtransactions are so widespread across the industry. Low effort, low risk, high reward. Money talks and If you think Anet cares about more people complaining, you gotta rethink some things.
---
There is no reason to not believe it
---
No, if you got the AR for t3, you most likely also have the gear to get AR for t4
---
That’s not true. If I loaded a build in gw1 it simply left a slot free if I didn’t have the skill unlocked and notified me that my char doesn’t meet the reqs for the build. If arc didn’t find an item it just didn’t load it.
---
Dont you have a planet made of gold?
---
I will try to illustrate it the best I can.
---
Build Templates are basically configurable presets of builds and items, made so you can change between them with few clicks.
---
This sounds pretty good, but it was something that the community asked for many years, and meanwhile, there was a good third party add-on that provided this functionality.
---
And now, Anet launches this system, making illegal to use said third party add-on, and monetizing the QoL that was asked for many years.
---
So, is a good thing to have build templates? Yes. It was something solved in a non official way? Yes. Should we pay for this? I will let you answer that question.
---
Weak strawman, make them client side with sharing through chat links. Plenty of third party services would be made available to back them up. If Anet doesn't want to foot the bill let people do it themselves.
---
*laughs in 2 monitors*
---
Hey, I've personally seen (in Discord) people spending their last money long before payday to buy some more Black Lion Chests to get Starborn outfit, and then posting results with sad emoji.

There are definitely suckers out there who will buy it and ask for more.
---
This is such a colossal joke that I don't even have to worry about my money :') even my gold doesn't wanna get near this garbage...
---
Oh there for sure will be, and they know it, otherwise it would have been free
---
Come on dude it’s just about 53.000.000€ just use your wallet, devs have to eat you know! ;)
---
Pretty sure veterans won't pay that either. I already came to terms with not having build templates long ago.
---
1. You can still use equipment and builds as you used to before patch was released and you can also continue to whine how much bank/inventory space gear takes. Neither we're forced to use the new feature
---
2. Nobody forces anyone to upgrade every single character or account; wanna waste your money - go ahead
---
3. There are already at least two 3rd party tools to manage build codes and as for now, arena doesn't chase people who created these
---
Still, I was hoping that the prices will be more reasonable but guess ncsoft finally after so many years has decided to grab arena by *****

you mean... 800 gems for 2 gear templates, 3 trait templates and your inventory costs only 800 gems???!!!  
---
Delete this post before anet raises the price of character slots to 2k!
---
&gt; I feel sad hearing you say it so matter-of-factly
---
It literally only means that they've been good at only checking in the required changes in this build.
---
2. Also, what's more important: nobody forces anyone to upgrade every single character or account; wanna waste your money - go ahead
---
Most certainly your feedback was noted and received. They just don’t give a fuck.
---
&gt;"Incentivize" is, as far as I can tell, almost impossible to say in any way except neutrally. Hence my original statement. 
---
Using a neutral term doesn't guarantee an honest representation.  The best example of this is unfortunately political, but it is such a good example I'm going to discuss it.  The US media frequently tries to portray the debate of climate change in a neutral manner.  Unfortunately when one side has a much larger percentage of scientists supporting it with many models and experimental evidence, and the other doesn't have nearly as much evidence, giving equal air time and using neutral words is in fact a dishonest portrayal of the evidence. 
---
You and I disagree because I believe Anet's systems pressure players to make gem purchases.  You don't believe that.  But your assertion that we should use the term, 'incentivize' to give a fair portrayal is innately assuming our belief is wrong, and your asking us to portray our beliefs in a manner to fit what you believe. We believe there is pressure, and so it is fair and honest for us to use the term. Because you don't believe there is pressure, you believe us using the term is lie, and therefore you think we are trying to criticize Anet.  
---
When OP asks why there is so much unnecessary loot, and I say it is to incentivize bag sales, I'm not saying that to criticize.  I'm giving OP my honest response.  The fact is none of us are Anet, we didn't make the decisions, all we can do is weigh the evidence and give our best interpretation of it.
---
XD
---
Then don't move your gear to storage??? Of course it wouldn't work then. I was someone with at least 5 builds per character, 4 legendary armors and one char that has two slots non legendary. I'm not buying anything at this pricing when I'm getting literally fuckall for 500gems. 
---
If you don't have that piece of equipment in your inventory, then the template should just not replace the old one. Arc managed to do this, why can't arenanet?
---
&gt; I'll leave gear templates aside for now because, sure, they do take out bag space and allow gear to be more easily swapped between characters (potentially).
---
How so? I've quickly looked at it in game, and gear isn't sharable between characters. You need to remove a piece of gear from all equipment templates that use it before you can move it to another character.
---
Had they built these with equipment sharing in mind, I'd have most likely bought some.
---
People asked for an apple and they gave us a rotten one. So grateful.
---
If they had a monthly sub, it wouldn't even be worth looking at lmao with what content??
---
we asked for this because it was free and improved in their *previous game*, and now we're supposed to be *grateful* that they're FINALLY adding it after so many years, with thrice-deep monetisation?
---
Okay, so...the instantaneous nature of the swap is fucking amazing, blows ArcDPS completely out of the water and is everything I dreamed of.
---
The free bag space is a godsend for a packrat like me.
---
Having 2/3 slots instead of 20/∞ is a fucking disgrace.
---
Having to pay thousands upon thousands upon thousands of gems to get anywhere *near* the luxury of unlimited templates needs to be the reason for a massive shitstorm.
---
I know its expensive when you add all that up. But who in their right mind needs all of that? Maybe more for a few mains but most of my alts have like 1 maybe a 2nd builds i use especially not 6 fucking tabs of gear. At the same time i dont agree fully with the pricing.
---
Guess I'll wait for sale
---
Price are higher than I expected. But it is hard to compare them to other things for sale - except for Equipment Templates. Roughly speaking, this is only another bag plus some convenience. Seems pricey.
---
You add an extra 0?
---
&gt; vote with your wallet.

I will do so and I already got myself a bunch of gems for template slots.

Im blaming commanders for pepetuating a hostility that leads pugs to leave when a mistake is made because bad commanders kick without explanation or recourse. 
---
Maybe that wasnt clear, but it should be now.
---
I'm disappointed that there's no way to set "this is my default PvE" and "this is my default WvW" builds. Having to remember to swap in addition to entering/exiting WvW is a QoL reduction that could easily have been avoided.
---
I'm also a bit disappointed that I can't bind "swap to build 1" and "swap to gear template 1" to the same hotkey.
---
Also pretty disappointed that it isn't possible to quickly swap your traits/skills around without editing your currently equipped build slot. The only way to have a "main" build that you can quickly get back to is to put it in your storage and go through the build editor UI. I was expecting "oh I need x trait for this fight, let me swap that and then I'll swap back to my normal after" to be a more freeform and explicitly supported thing.
---
All in all, I was really looking forward to these, and the implementation just isn't as smooth and flexible as I was hoping.
---
where even other than reddit? the official forums are super moderated to the point even a shred of negativity can get you banned from their forums or they completely delete your comment anyway
---
Right. I know it doesn't gel with Reddit's view and frustrations, but really I'd be shocked if they have more than 2 builds.
---
Anyway, I fully expect the hardcore raiders to have another 3rd party solution soonish, and I doubt ANet will touch it.
---
For 50 bucks I can get a whole brandnew game that will give me hundreds of hours of play. Anet is truly disgusting. Won't give them a single cent ever again.
---
They could, it would just a lot of work with refunds etc..
---
People can never vote with their wallets, unless their livelihood is at stake.

---
don't forget about inventory storage (bag slots) and yearly birthdays. 
---
Buying another character is smarter than buying another build.  What a mess.
---
it wouldn't be bad if it was per account rather than per character, but there's no way I'm paying 1,500 gems for an extra slot on my main three characters
---
They said it would be about like the prices for bank and bag slots, so this is as expected.
---
Thank you!
---
Equipment templates? Fair.
---
Build templates? Not so much. Quite literally - were they cheap i would not see a problem, but like this theyre just an artificial Problem.
---
So, we‘ve lost one build slot, eh?
---
I have been playing since launch and honestly I don't see the need for more than 3 builds per character.  I will probably have 1 pve, wvw, &amp; dungeons/fractals.  Most people don't even play wvw or raid and just play the type of content they like to play.  
---
To the average play they don't need to spend any money to enjoy the whole gear/builds template system.
---
Can you bind the same key for both the build and equipment template?
---
its not about the fk trait template, most people can swap it in like 10 seconds anyway, its all about the gear templates...
---
EAnet
---
Going forward, it makes you wonder if they will start charging here and there for new "features" in the "Saga" which would have been normally included in an expansion.
---
I dont think anyone is overly mad it's monetized.  People are mad that the system is confusing, convoluted and is vastly overpriced.  300gems to store a fucking chat code that you can store in notepad, lol wut?  Seriously, I would have considered a few here and there if the prices were like half, but it is fucking ridiculous that these are the costs when you have so many different game modes.  If people spend the 300 gems for chat code storage, I have a bridge to sell.
---
yes it's ridiculous, on a per account basis I'd probably go for 1 or 2, but there's no way i'm paying for each character
---
Ah ha what the fuck
---
Keep ArcDPS build template functionality up and we're good. No reason to complain.

you install arc and shift click.  It seems Anet's system doesn't have this.

You know why ArenaNet makes money and continues to release mount skins, outfits, and other convenience items?  Because people ALREADY VOTE WITH THEIR WALLETS and ArenaNet takes notice.  We get a plethora of skins because people buy them.

Yes I do. I been playing since beta. The funny thing is that I saved up 10,000 gems for this. What a fucking joke.
---
Yes! And it's fucking stupid. That's why I call Arenanet devs a bunch of FUCKING UNTALENTED CLOWNS. It's not event templates. It's like loadout
---
i Just want Anet to tell me what they need so i can get: New Elitespeccs or an Expansion. I help, i buy. But with the current state, of not knowing if we "only" get maps and Story its hard to invest in the game.

This mockup is already 100x better than the UI that Anet came up with.

Don't spend money on a company that needed 7 years to add a basic feature that the sequel had while also making it an immensily costly downgrade of a one-man-community addon. This just speaks volumes of how incompetent and out-of-touch ANet is. Just the fact that a new character is cheaper than the same amount of new build expansions is a testament to how unrefined and badly thought-out the whole system is.

more characters = more birthdays and more alt parking, also more fashion wars

---
Wish we could but the technology for planting a working brain in arenanets's devs isn't there yet
---
Build templates have always been about speed. It's fast to use build templates to swap between power and condi between raid fights for example. Swapping characters to do that might not even be worth the time depending on the fight.
---
&gt; But The thing with expac is that it gives new elite specs, new mechanics, new story, new masteries, new meta's and all and then every 3-4months u get living world episodes.
---
and who says we can't get it with living world episodes as well or not even tied to living world but as a regular addition to the game like build templates or something.
---
You don't need an expansion for this to happen because that is something you then have to pay for.
---
And while your second point of "drawing players in" has validity I think this is more the problem of how players notice those releases. In literally every game an expansion is a huge thing that, as you yourself said, adds a lot of stuff to the game to give players something new they can do.
---
But don't Living world updates exactly the same but only in smaller chunks in a smaller release schedule? Those are not "big things" and are therefore overlooked a lot.
---
But maybe our opinions on this thing are just that different...
---
Is it me or does 1k gold not even sound that bad. But put that into real money it sounds insane
---
While I think the Build Store and Build Tabs are stupidly priced, considering 99% of people will just store them on Notepad, I think Gear Templates being monetized isn’t too bad. Also, if people really don’t want to buy into it ANET has seemingly given the green light on the modified arctemplates .dll so I’m sure most hardcore people will just use that.
---
Yeah why reward anet with gem sales? It's like your local cinema adding a $6 medium popcorn bundle to make the $7 large bundle look like a steal.
---
I am sad I'm part of this community
---
oh nvm I'm not anymore bye
---
And they were right to do so. Why exactly spend resources in a game mode that an extremely small part of the community only plays?
---
Moving to another game is the best option for you, but don't blame Anet for not spending more resources on raids, blame the "raiders" for excluding the vast majority of the player base with their toxicity.
---
Hopefully we can get a fix for skills going on cooldown when swapping build (trait?) templates. When you have a FireBrand mantra and your new build has the same mantra. It also "changes" it and goes on full cooldown.
---
False.  They don't have to buy anything.  ArenaNet isn't forcing anyone to buy this stuff.
---
Yeah. If you play wvw, you automatically lose a build slot with that character. This also apply to pvp.  
---
(In short, if you play all three modes, you only have a single build available per mode.)
---
Arenanet you suck shit.
---
Thread removed: Spamming is not allowed.
---
Yeah true. My feeling says that they just don't care anymore. They will bring GW2 to definite end now no matter what we say and try to make the most profit out of it to finally move on to another game. For my part about "expansion worth content", if they don't deliver the 3rd generation of elite specs or a whole expansion after Icebrood then I am out. I stuck to this game for 7 years. I witnessed all the ups and donws so far but everything that happened after season 5 is just a let down so far. I saw enough of living season, it just doesn't cut it for me any longer. What they delivered so far is not worth investing in.
---
This just made me really sad to think about.

if it were account wide, sure. but per character?

I mostly don't think the concerns are legitimate. I think the free offerings are quite generous, sufficient for the vast majority of players, and, as always, if you don't like something, just don't buy it.

Arc dps templates were free and better done. Sorry anet but your templates are a shame.
---
It's essentially another equipment panel, which is rather stupid because it doesn't save you any time unless number of "templates" you have = number of builds you play without switching anything. Essentially it's worse using 2 loadouts than 1 if you're constantly swapping stuff, making equipment "templates" a bunch of bs.

Lord I hope not.

because anet are greedy company now and they care more about money then delivering a good game

What is an efficient tagging build? Can you give some examples please? Thanks!
---
I would say more exactly that leg gear devalues the Equipment storage: for each piece of leg gear you have you do not really gain the benefit of inventory place because it was already taking you no space.
---
If you had 4 regular (non-leg) armors you would gain 6*3 = 18 inventory slots by using the loadout system. If you are using a leg armor to achieve the same goal you gain 0 inventory space for the armor but you still pay each gear template the same price.
---
farming, I know, I do it too, but that doesn't mean I will spend any gems on it. I don't need 5 different builds for one char on my second account.
---
Making it bound to only characters is a fk joke from EAnet, it would have beein much easier to implement also, if they just added another bag type something similar to shared slots we already had, but just make it bigger and allow only to put gear inside.
---
But this way they can make way way more money   so guess way the did it this way
---
Oh I see what you mean. I guess I find it faster, because with the Anet one you have to do both equipment and builds separately, and if you don't have either equipment or build open up last (i.e. say you were fiddling with outfits, wardrobe, achievements etc.) then you have to navigate to each of those as well.
---
Whereas with ArcDPS, I did all of it in 3 clicks and it took 2 seconds to complete after that. (or instant if in LA, which is where I usually changed my build)
---
Oh this is some very nice QoL.
---
Build templates are pure convenience. You can use unlimited amount of builds for free by just using chat codes.
---
I wish arenanet allready fixed character selection screen and the moment is tidious to navigate through. I don't know how players with 64 or something character manage to navigate them.
---
What the fuck. Mosquito Feast outfit.
---
Considering they leave after 1 or 2 failed attempts ... yeah, pretty much impossible for that to be practice.
---
Welcome to the dreaded maintenance mode
---
We were saying that 2 weeks now. But Arenanet didn't give a single fuck. Maybe because they don't care, maybe because the can't do it. Either way, the system is a fucking disgrace.
---
Why on earth would they change it?
---
It works for them.
---
bye
---
nope
---
Find a guild and one that doesnt yell or scream if you are truly interested in raids. My guild is chill, easy raiding group that cracks jokes and has zero tolerance for any kind of asshole.
---
If you manage to gather a crew of friends (or at least emotionally stable strangers) willing to go through the wringer, it's actually super fun. But yeah, without that I'd rather not.
---
Anet is so allergic to reasonable pricing.
---
They develop like a casual wide-appeal MMO and then they price like a premium gacha game. Even back to the first mount skins for 2000 gems, random masks for 500, so many of their prices are way out of touch. I swear they'd make more revenue if they cut most of their prices in half.
---
I'm already at almost 30 but if you insist...
---
The agreement with Delta about ArcDPS build template was literally that it was allowed/tolerated as long as Anet didn't have a "template" system. SO any other 3rd party to do roughly what arcdps templates did could expose you to a ban now.
---
Booted out of WvW twice so far.
---
keyfarm is only for that account you use, since I have so much stuff on my main account I won't send any gems on my second account. so keyfarming on my second would be useless ...
---
I remember when we had similar shitstorms here about shared slots costs 700 gems or mounts 2000. Today no one give a second thought, this will be the same in a few days :-)
---
I have one fractal toon, one wvw toon, and the rest are pve. So these templates are pretty much perfect for me. I can see how others can be frustrated if they manage more build for raids, etc. tho.
---
&gt;I trust with my whole heart, and I'll enjoy everything what they do no matter anything, no matter anything...
---
You are on an unhealthy road my friend. That or you joined a weird Arenanet cult.
---
It gives evidence that the Nightmare Court has interest in Malyck. It gives no evidence that the fourth lane or speculated fifth map had anything to do with Malyck though, as was being suggested above.
---
Will not buy
---
Thats exactly was gonna happen with NCsoft and EAnet from now on, you can quote me on that
---
You can't at the moment I believe. It will grey out the unusable skills/weapons while you swap the build and equipment seperately but still swap to them.
---
You can only swap gear with a single press.
---
Same
---
Thank you for always doing this Shaman!

I have a short video showing the Primal outfit on a few of the female races. If you want to take a look.   
---
[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa5evXsyVI0)
---
have fun dreaming that would never happen with NCSoft now in charge haha
---
How so? Theres at least 20 groups that launch at reset, not including the ease of finding one 3 hours after reset or even a few hours before.
---
Maybe they should rename themselves to EAnet.
---
Better yet, rename marketing to BlizzANet, sales to EAnet, and dev team to BethesdANet, because each is as competent in their thing as their namesakes.
---
Yes, could, but from my limited time observing these gem store stuff, they mostly don't put "returning items" ahead of a patch. Then again, the "mostly" is there because it happened once so far during the time I've been tracking them. So yeah, could, but also could not.
---
yikes
---
Thats The Firstborn cultural Sylvari armor. 
---
The
---
colors are: Frostbite Green, Oasis and Glint's Isolation
---
Too expensive. Will not buy.
---
More slots [of this](https://streamable.com/cqw25) costs money.
---
Now my PvE characters have 3x time more slots for free, and my PvP/WvW characters have 3x time more slots for free. That's a win-win for me.
---
The reality is that most people are not going to really need more than the 2 gear slots and 3 build slots, but for build slots the alternative of just having the chat codes saved somewhere is so easy that it's largely just not a big deal. 
---
It doesn't really excuse this that much, but I will get to enjoy the convenience of this feature without paying a cent. It's unfortunate that players who really like to have many specific builds will have to shell out too much for it.
---
already have, uninstalled weeks ago
---
The save system I'll use is "Build Storage". It's not ideal, but at least I can save stuff there.
---
Slap hotkeys on it. I do ctrl+num1/2 and switch from Assassin's to Diviner's in .1 seconds.
---
guess why that´s not allowed anymore :\^)
---
Pathetic
---
Must be a newer player, I just upgraded to my 3rd planet last week.
---
Again, if you have dedicated characters for each gamemode that doesn't affect you, but many use the same characters for different gamemodes.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model
---
we are currently at anger phase
---
Yes honey, some people use it - you dont have to
---
Yeah and their marketing department TOTALLY won't just spin that as "people don't really want build templates"
---
**Kübler-Ross model**
---
The Kübler-Ross model, or the five stages of grief, postulates a series of emotions experienced by terminally ill patients prior to death, or people who have lost a loved one, wherein the five stages are: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Although commonly referenced in popular media, the existance of these stages has not been demonstrated and the model is not considered helpful in explaining the grieving process.The model was first introduced by Swiss-American psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in her 1969 book On Death and Dying, and was inspired by her work with terminally ill patients. Motivated by the lack of instruction in medical schools on the subject of death and dying, Kübler-Ross examined death and those faced with it at the University of Chicago medical school. Kübler-Ross' project evolved into a series of seminars which, along with patient interviews and previous research, became the foundation for her book.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
---
I don't really see the problem here, since this subreddit always states that pvp is dead and WvW is dying. So one or two open slots?
---
;)
---
We used to be constructive and all that until we discovered that Arenanet sees us ONLY as wallets. When we discovered that our honest feedback is getting neglected over and over. When we discovered that the number one purpose of Arenanet is adding features in the  gem shop with the most greedy way. So yeah, you can fuck off alongside them.
---
But certain models, no matter how you dye them still look horrendous
---
Did you really need to comment?
---
They replied during the stream that they're thinking about making them switchable together with a single key.
---
I recently upgraded from an i5 3570 with 12gb of 1333mhz ram to a ryzen 7 3700x and 16gb of ddr4 3200mhz, and the difference was nigth and day. Everything is really smooth and I never knew the game would be so much more enjoyable with the new ryzen processor. My gpu is a gtx 1070 and I play at ultrawide 2560x1080p with gsync enabled. It's a really good experience. I get from 50-75fps with gsync enabled which is in the range of my monitor. I'm having a great time.
---
That's clearly their goal  
---
What they're hoping is they can do it gradually enough that people won't notice they're paying hundreds to get what would have been $30 in a one time package  
---
Late 2019 Anet releasing mounts would have seen each one as a gem store purchase of 800gems each. Sure you could just buy a couple but it would cost you $60-70 for all of them and that's just for mounts.
---
Hm, I have so many hotkeys already, not sure if I could find useful ones that would save time.
---
Maybe my numpad? Hmm.
---
Usually, ppl who have the need for so many extra build slots have more than enough gold:-)
---
If i understood right, i need to unequip my legendary weapon from my equipment template eveyrtime i want to use it in a build that isnt that one? Wouldn't that completely defeat the purpose of having both the template and legendary?
---
That's not really the point. An issue is that they call that a "template" (for both gear and build) while it is actually a "loadout". Here they are kinda really abusing what the word "template" means in such cases and puting a complete different meaning on it.
---
They most probably had technical limitations to do it that way because inventory code is probably a bit dangerous to touch or chatever, I don't really care, but they could have at least be honest about what it is in the name and just call it a "loadout".
---
Maybe you should play the game you like so much and leave reddit for us.
---
Last time when mai trin was t4 daily we wiped at 25%, because we didnt communicate what we gonna do, like going to burst horrik or focus on adds first and we kind of split up and everyone did what they thought was best in that moment and we wiped, one guy immediately left and blamed the FB that we all died.
---
I dont understand why people have such low tolerance to failure, everything needs to play out perfectly or its a waste of time. That attitude is so weird and it happens so often.
---
Fortunately with this system the builds still can be text files on your computer. Just gotta wait for someone to back and extremely basic third party program to swap it quickly.
---
https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-five-stages
---
I would have gladly traded the "account build templates" for a third gear template slot
---
Yup. We know. They actually specifically stated that.
---
Before the update you had three build templates, although no gear templates or even storage. And you couldn't chose to use your WvW template for PvE, for example.
---
Now you got three build templates and two gear templates, and can do with it what you want.
---
Win some, lose some. Get fucked if you play all three gamemodes. Heaven forbid you play several different roles in different gamemodes, and may God have mercy on your bloodline if you also have minor differences in build and load-out depending on group composition and situation.
---
Wew, you aren't the fast one, right? Buildtemplates came out exactly as expected.
---
You seem to have deluded yourself into thinking we're all needlessly hating on the developers. We aren't. Anet isn't just its developers, it's a corporation that wants your money.
---
Here's a list of things off the top of my head that they've done wrong in recent history: 
---
1. Their implementation, limitation, and over priced monetization of Build Templates. 
---
2. Asking for our feedback, getting overwhelmimg responses of constructive critism... and changing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING after it, reminding us once again that Anet doesn't care about your opinion if it means losing out on money.
---
3. Strict focus on open world. Don't get me wrong, i love playing through the new open world stuff, but I'd much prefer more frequent instanced content.... With the time/resources/money/effort that goes into a single living world episode, they could probably create 3 Raids &amp; 3 Fractals, and release them all at once... Now THAT would be exciting... unfortunately it isnt monetizable, and open world episodes are, so that's what we're stuck with.
---
4. WvW and PvP... I'm not even going to bother going into this.
---
5. Constantly missing the mark on Balance patches, and once again ignoring community feedback.
---
8 sets here, I feel your pain :(
---
Your post makes it sound as if you have a hard emotional attachment to GW2, and on an unhealthy path.
---
ArenaNet is a company. Companies want money. We pay money in exchange for entertainment.
---
They aren't a friend, nor' do they care about your "trust". Please do not be shocked by that revelation.
---
That isn't to say you're not allowed to like the current implementation. But the way you're going about it, and what other people in this thread right now, you don't seem to be healthy.
---
Said it a month ago. I said I was rdy to pay quite a lot of money to permanent account unlocks, which are more satisfying (you max your account) and don't "punish" buying character slots (in the sense that you'd need to pay another 2100 gems per new character to have them maxed, on top of the 2k gems for bags and 3k for gathering tools).
---
But they chose not to do it. Instead, we have expensive per-character unlocks that would require me to spend thousands of € to max. But you know what, the build templates took so long to come, I already have enough characters to be happy with 3 builds and 2 gears on each.
---
Maybe when they realize that big whales like me who usually jump on every new unlock and spend more money on this game than is reasonnable, don't buy a single template slot today, they'll realize that the new system is not appealing to player wallets.
---
Well yeah, I‘ll definetely **not** going to pay hundreds of euros.
---
This seems to be like an overreaction but maybe it‘s a good point to quit the game after months of disappointment and Anet‘s monetization shit.
---
You can only have 2 Gear templates per character (unless you buy more).
---
So as far as this system is concerned, you can have 1 set of legendary armor in both tabs, or 2 sets of ascended armor.  The cost difference between the two is staggering.
---
Now that's a very narrow view of the issue, given Leg armor still lets you change the armor stats at will, including upgrades.
---
But in the context of each character swapping from Gear Template #1 to #2, yeah, Leg armor adds no value.
---
Build storage lets you save them while tinkering. Also, builds are chat links, so if you like inconvenience, you have infinite build storage in notepad.
---
&gt;I don't treat you as people anymore, you are like ANIMALS
---
PSA : humans ARE animals.
---
So I could have maybe kinda sorta seen making equipment slots 400gem, which would be on par with a bag slot, since you can store up to 15 items there.  But 500gem?
---
Uhm, no. Another bag slot is a far better option.
---
And making build templates char bound is just crazy. 
---
166gm per template? with a cap of 24? How is that supposed to dissuade the inevitable clipboard shuffler tools that will be about?
---
Yea it's true this happens, even I do it sometimes, but it usually happens for some reasons too:
---
1. Depends on the lfg; honnestly, if I happen to join a 300+LI lfg w1 for example and if during the fight, basics mistakes occurs, people clearly slacking, lack of boons, ... and then even endup wiping, well it kinda doesnt make me want to play.
---
2. Rewards; the rewards are pretty shit lets be honest, and I dont really want going through the hassle of doing 2-3 tries of gorseval to get my 2gold + exo. As I said, when I join a 300LI lfg I kinda expect people having some basics knowledge of what they need to do during mains mechanics.
---
3. Game is boring; I ended up playing gw2 only for the  fusion of the omega ultra interesting gameplay and the boss design. If in the end, I just cant play gw2 "to the fullest" because of people not understanding the game get, well I'll just leave and let the spot to someone that might enjoy playing in this spicific groupe more than me and who rly needs the kill.
---
Some will tell me 300Li isnt much, which I totally agree, but it should still be plently enough Li to get how to give perma quickness alacrity and 25might fury + being aware of what's a breakbar.
---
Static group? It doesnt really change the problem in the end since post is kinda targetted towards the lfg.
---
But tbh, statics arent that good neither, people join static only to have a structured schedule, not really for the lvl en people.
---
I'm toxic? Well yea might be, I prefer leaving rather than starting to argue with people and really becoming toxic which is retarded imo. 
---
I talk about 300Li+ groups, ofc I wont really do that in a 50li group (eventhough, most of the time, in a 50Li group you end up having a 300li tank or w/e because new people usually are scared facing mechanics, which I guess is normal but it tends to stay until 300li+ (: )
---
Love
---
Many use Lamborghinis instead of public buses, it's their choice and they pay for it.
---
I voiced my opinion against the way Anet planned out this feature a few times over the past month but actually *using* this mess is another thing entirely.
---
Gg
---
That's what I meant with num1/2. Ctrl+NUM1 is Assassin gear, ctrl+NUM2 is Assassin build.
---
Builds I frequently switch to and fro from I use keybinds for. Rarer builds I can click through the UI.
---
i'd use numpad 7 + 4 for build #1 and 8 + 5 and 9 + 6 for others, but i already have the numpad for the mounts
---
Personally I'm just disappointed that the two parts you interact with most (character build and character gear loadouts) aren't even actual templates. Sure, switching between different sets is nice I guess but it's not something I particularly care for or was looking for.
---
I wanted build templates, which do exist but only as the chat links you can store on your account. I wanted gear templates, which don't exist. And I wanted cosmetic templates, which don't exist at all (the different build tabs don't even allow for unique show/hide flags on head and shoulder pieces).
---
Yeah as someone that likes the idea of a main character and have about 6.5k hours played with 5.8k on my main, this situation is laughably awful.
---
Congratulations on not understanding what maintenance mode is.
---
Ah, I read num1 as in 1 above the w. I getcha. Yeah, I may do that, thanks for the suggestion.
---
OMEGAYAWN
---
no ideas what u said.  yes.  current live build is the active build template.  any changes on current live build also affect the active build template.
---
They should be but I doubt it.
---
I haven't lost faith of the ingame community in my opinion the community ingame is still the greatest and friendliest community I've seen in any MMO willing to help with anything, answering question new players have straight away, waiting in starting maps willing to help new players even with the new templates system has possibilities of community interaction and helpfulness with sharing builds people ask for. Having said that though since 2016 the forums and reddit community has decided to attack every little thing Anet does I will stress I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT EVERYONE but a small minority has hijacked this sub reddit to make it a reddit that attacks Anet for everything. Now build templates and the idea of locking slots behind the gem store I get the anger I don't agree with it as its in line with Anets business model of cosmetic and convenience. My point is theres a small minority ruining this sub reddit and community and quite frankly we'd be better off if they just quit.
---
I've played over 17k hours here and paid less than 150$ in total for the game and expansions, that is a damn huge chunk of fun for my money. And the only thing they asked for on top is spending every now and then a few bucks for completely optional things to keep the game service running. 
---
Unlike other games, you are not forced to buy any of that in order to progress in the game. Unlike other games, you can buy gems with gold and unlike other games, you are able to farm enough gold to buy every single item in the gem store.
---
Same. I built several legendaries specifically to swap them between characters, and this does not support my investment at all.
---
I too wish to live in Utopia.
---
You also don't get the fashion saving and swapping QoL.
---
I don't think the prices are too bad though. Of course I would prefer them cheaper but...

---
You mean BlishHud or the template addon? BlishHud can be downloaded at the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlishHUD/), but the creator is still working on build templates addons.
---
This post is more hateful and negative than the majority of the communities posts.
---
I think that the downhill trend in community reaction has been a direct result of the downhill trend in ANet's development philosophy.
---
On NA Monday is reset day. If you take yesterday for example I literally had to camp lfg groups cuz they filled up so fast I was midway reading the requirement before someone snatch the last spot in multiple runs. I did W3,4,1,2,6,5,7 uninterrupted in different pug runs just jumping from one lfg to the next. Was quite lucky but when I was checking the lfg there were many runs up.
---
Might have to add links to overlays in my manager....TaCO, BlishHUD and now this clipboard are all great tools! Good work!
---
Mandatory, "can I have your stuff?".
---
well some players are willing to become their cash cow.
---
Yip. This sub and the official forums should be drowning in concerns given how Anet have implemented this.
---
It's a really big misstep and normally I'm happy to give them the benefit of the doubt.
---
Oh... no. With that thinking you have just destroyed 7 years of work with templates.
---
Wasn't swiss tournament support supposed to be in this update? I didn't see it mentioned anywhere in patch notes.
---
why should i have to pay to play one character rather than 3?  
---
I never had to previously. Admittedly I still don't if all I want is one build each for pve pvp and wvw - but I lose out on convenience. Before the update the game would adjust my traits for me as soon as I entered the gamemode - now I have to open my character window go to traits and swap my build.
---
Just leave Reddit it's literally the saltiest cesspool ever. If you go in game there are tons of people who actually enjoy the game instead of sit around bitching about it.
---
Oh no! Bye!
---
when the fk is the timekeeper outfit gonna be back....
---
The gemstore image has Mordremoth's vines in it and looks like something straight out of Verdant Brink. I doubt that'll be relevant anytime soon.
---
Not really. It looks goofier and, overall, worse. Certainly sticking with the pieces, which not only look better but can also be mixed and matched.
---
Fuck off, and take your politics with you.
---
yep dont buy.
---
1) if they actually fix the templates and adjust price, youll feel like idiot for buying char slot
---
2) rewarding them with money to work around their mess is stupid
---
I don't think the intention was ever to give additional templates, just to provide QoL.
---
Separate build tabs for wvw would be nice.
---
I hope not :(
---
Pretty sure it's much more complex than that. Do we really need to make up shit to bash this update? Aren't there enough actual reasons?
---
Hahahahha
---
Then I shouldn't look forward to their next game is this is how they will monetize
---
FWIW I've spent literally thousands on this game since launch. I've been fine with MOST decisions anet have made and overall have agreed with their monetization. I still play the game, and I'm not even against ALL monetization for build templates. I think equipment slots and the character bound template slots should be gem store items, albeit somehwat cheaper. But because build storage is limited to a max of 24 and STILL costs 500 gems to unlock more, anet will not be receiving any money from me going forward. 
---
Even some of us hypercasual "anet fanbois" have our limits. This was mine.
---
Equipment templates maaaaybe, big maybe and overpriced but at least you get something. Charging anything - ANYTHING - for build templates or build storage is completely asinine to me. 500 gems to copy and paste three chat codes? What the fuck? 300 gems to pick some traits and utilities?
---
Thanks for keeping this game free for me. You're a good little consumer.
---
/u/Jonanet /u/Dornsinger /u/ANET_BenP /u/AnetFrosty
---
I hope you feel bad for this Templates for Gems thing, we have been asking you for this for such a long time, and then you stab us in the back like this. This could have been such a easy thing to make Players happy instead your own Greed destroys everything. I sincerely Hope you reconsider this action, i can tell that this was not a choice by the devs but by the executive branch so i dont blame the Devs, still you went along with it without saying anything.
---
I myself will just continue making new Characters instead of ever using Templates just out of Principle.
---
people predicted this since the first announcement a month ago and gave feedback accordingly. nothing changed.
---
yeah idk what the heck happened here. it's 1 higher than twice the max integer size
---
I'd consider saving the links outside the game as more convenient than the ingame system as is. Having the template actually saved somewhere permanently, with effectively infinite space, is far better than having to rotate in/out of limited shared slots.
---
My plan is to use the links in my existing build organizing setup in OneNote.
---
No I only have phone to play DI what is notepad.
---
It literally fits any game.
---
One week starting now, I presume.
---
7 years later and my wish of ele out of combat is here.
---
Only 200gems per single keybind.
---
Who cares, if they want money they should develop expansions worth playing. Putting a lite feature in the game and milking the players for the full benefits is an insult to their customers.
---
&gt; Historically, constructive criticism doesn't seem to effect their decision making in any meaningful way, so you need to hit em where it hurts, their wallet.
---
Historically there have been cases where constructive criticism effected their decision making. 
---
Also historically these "vote with your wallet" rallies have never worked. I'm not saying buy the things, I'm saying people will do it anyway. Only over time, if the feature turns out undesirable by everyone (not just reddit) will the sales drop. When it comes to wallet voting in a community of tens/hundreds of thousands, tends to come more naturally than intentionally.
---
Still. Seriously though, people, if you hate something, don't buy it. Financial irresponsibility is a thing, and it does not look good on you.
---
It turns out that constructive feedback is still the best thing we can do. Don't turn your back on that. Whether they listen or not is on them, but we can still do our part. Also keep in mind that just because corporate decided on this, it does not mean the majority of the developers agree with it personally.
---
So far I have 2 issues - item storage should be account-wide so we could swap sets between characters easily and they should allow us to bind build and gear swap withing 1 key.
---
I was playing the grawl shaman fractal in t3 the other week, when 2 people in my party dove into the lava and died before the boss. When I asked why, they were like "you must not have played t4". I don't give a crap what kind of advanced kamikaze strats you are playing at, you wasted everyone's time.
---
Don't play the game*
---
&gt;Then don't move your gear to storage??? Of course it wouldn't work then. 
---
Not a viable solution for something that needs to work, 100% of the time, for every player. One of this games biggest design principles is "you can't screw this up". No matter what you build, you're going to have 5 weapon skills on your bar that do something coherent and useful. No matter what skills and traits you unlock, you'll be able to get all your core stuff by lvl80 and freely swap them. Anet would never design a gear template system that you can break by moving stuff in your inventory, it just does not fit in this game.
---
&gt; If you don't have that piece of equipment in your inventory, then the template should just not replace the old one. Arc managed to do this, why can't arenanet?

Arc was a hack and it did not always function properly. It got away with a lot of issues because a) its user base was exclusively power users who cared enough to trouble shoot issues and work around sometimes iffy functionality, and b) it was a free mod, so there was always an understanding that it wouldn't be polished. Anet would get neither of those credits. A system they released would have to work perfectly every time. No inventory hack would cut it.
---
I agree. Having spent at least a thousand on this game, I can't justify it anymore. There's no future. What are we buying build templates for? What content? There's no promise of anything from ANet besides more things to spend money on. It's not worth it. It's time to move on.
---
When you put it that way, it almost sounds like it's not expensive enough.
---
sadly worthless. people already gave feedback and they decided to change nothing. the only thing you can do is vote with your login.
---
i can recommend PoE and borderlands 2
---
I've been voting with my wallet (shut tight) since 2018. Were there times when I wanted to buy gems? Yes. But my determination is stronger than that. Wish more people had self-control..
---
Maybe if you could just make up your mind on playing something than it wouldn't be a problem
---
I would prefer it with you had some kind of toggle. Current working build, load slot 1 or 2 into working build. Any edits I'm the working build don't update the slot 1 or 2. Or maybe... you once you've loaded you can have a select box  that has changes to current build overwrites selected slot
---
I'm still kinda upset that the Mist Stranger outfit wasn't Lord Odrin or something. That outfit has so much story potential.
---
If I remember correctly having a single input for a Build and Equipment Template is something that they're working on (or were at least looking into), but weren't able to get lined up in time for the main release, so hopefully workarounds like this won't be required for too long.
---
100% agree with this if this was acount wide storage for all my characters I would throw my money at them as it stands they can kick rocks.
---
Nobody is actually *worse* off because of the update, despite much whining. 
---
Whether the cost/benefit makes the new templates 'worth' it is just the normal gem-store conundrum.
---
Ah, a sane post driven by common sense.
---
Thank you.
---
Yes, this update ruined legendary gear from several angles and made it extremely difficult to do minor changes to adapt to changing situations.
---
It's a very important one because people requested "templates" the way most people think what a "template" is and the way some experienced it through ArcDPS templates (they really are templates) and Anet gave us "loadouts" while saying they delivered the long awaited and requested "template" feature. There is a very distinct difference between the 2 and it really does matter because they don't do the same thing and don't have the value or use-case.
---
A big difference about loadout is that whatever change you may do to it will remain stored/saved so if you needed to swap a few pieces of gear or te re-stat some leg gear you can't go back easily/directly to your initial state because it does not exist anymore.
---
Another issue that is appeared (maybe it will change?) is that if you want to transfer a gear piece from a character to another you need to remove it from ALL the templates it's in and then you can tranfer it.
---
It's 6 per character. 24 is the build storage, which is account based. 24 slots isn't much help if you're already needing more than 6 per character.
---
The lack of self-awareness is fucking astounding
---
So I never used build templates until today. Yet the feature is cool, but really misses the mark with my legendary sets. I play WvW quite a bit, and tend to bounce between two light classes and two heavy...and I STILL have to use a banker to drop off these legendary armor/trinket and weapon sets. Like...why? Q\_Q. They should have at least added this feature for those who own legendary items, but hey, I guess that's a tall request.
---
Sorry but 500 gems is over priced? 2k gems for a god damn mount skin is overkill, 500 gems is nothing and I dont even put any more into the game...
---
Most groups run heal quickbrand but there's always some heal renegades out there and that's where power quickness shines. It's a better combination anyways since it offers more cc than healbrand with alacrigade simply due to the lack of Bane Signet on healbrand
---
I get that "Anet = greedy" is pretty applicable to a lot of what's going on right now, but this is likely by and large a database issue that is quite difficult to overcome rather than greed one (because they'd actually make more money if they supported this).
---
there is a reason i tagged you as absolute moron, you are the anet apologist
---
I've never used ArcDps and never even considered downloading it, and I still feel robbed from this update.
---
I agree, don't buy anything anet sends out, it's worrying that a third party was able to execute build templates in a much more simple and friendly ui than anet, a corporation game. Now who's got the knockoff boots?! :D
---
I feel comfortable in saying anyone who did not use arcDPS has absolutely no need of build templates beyond possibly RPers.
---
They might like them/use them. But they did not need them.
---
I have 10 characters most of which have different builds for pve, pvp, and wvw, along with a gear set for wvw. Two of those carry a set for raiding.
---
So yeah, pretty much perfect for me. Only seems to limit players that want to one trick characters, using the same one for a dozen different things, requiring different gear and kits for each.
---
That is unfortunate, but I am not sure how many players it actually applies to. Hard to tell how many people this legitimately hurts and how many are just bandwagoning. Last night most of the chatter in maps that I saw was positive and people were just excited to free up inventory space.
---
This isn't political and the stakes aren't anywhere close to climate change, so your argument is boorish and self-aggrandizing. The answer to IP's question was not "because they're trying to get you to buy bags," it was "because you're not supposed to open the ToT bags until you're done farming."
---
Are you quite finished?
---
Literally the same story for bag slots, this is not news.
---
I shouldn’t have to buy character slots because the build template feature is monetized
---
&gt; Gosh jolly! Can't wait to have my feedback ~~ignored~~ deleted! *slaps thigh*
---
FTFY
---
I agree with build templates, yes. Equipment storage, eh not really since it's basically adding extra item slots to your inventory. I think of them more like bag slot upgrades.
---
&gt; I do like the zerker, but I feel way to squishy.
---
That's the whole point. It's a high-risk, high-reward squishy high-dps Warrior.
---
I bought the 2000 gems package thinking it was account bound for equipment and build templates.  UNLOCKED IT on the WRONG character thinking it was account bound.  I am very sad now :(
---
Annnnnd that's why i'm out.  I'd rather spend my money on any number of better games.  Picked up Destiny 2 last week, and then have the new Star Wars and Cyberpunk on the horizon.  So many solid looking games coming, no need to work ourselves up over this trash from Anet.
---
And be sure to also stop playing the game.
---
Oh wait, you are bothered, but you are not THAT bothered? Yeah ... that's why telling a few randoms to "vote with their wallet" doesn't really work.
---
I'm no conspiracy nut but the way that people manage to shove FF into every goddamn thread makes me wonder if they haven't hired some firm to make an "organic" marketing push.
---
His toughness is actually 700 because of the Berserker tradeoff.
---
I'm one of the first people that would love to only play one build for the rest of the game's life, but not only do many people not enjoy that idea, higher end content doesn't allow it. 
---
If a group needs a specific role, and I can't do it or refuse to, I don't get to do that content. Yes, it is a bit of a first world problem, but considering what "build templates" have always been, this is a slap in the face.
---
Yeah dont give anet money till they fix their stupidity. So pretty much never.
---
Well they looked at it, and fixed it for the genstore foefire pieces released a week later... soooo yay I guess ?
---
What's wrong w/ voicing an opinion? Also being fast can't be taken into account, what if someone has work and the update releases while they're working? We're still on patch day, give it a break. That's missing the point entirely. 
---
Though I agree. build templates came out just as expected, half assed, a third party did it better.
---
Also, there is absolutely no need or place to compare the update with arcdps. ANet announced Build Templates, so we want and expect functional build templates. And we didn't get that. If some 3rd party addon did it better doesn't interfere with anything.
---
tbh people would've outraged about the price no matter what number they've put next to them
---
&gt;God have mercy on your bloodline if you also have minor differences in build and load-out depending on group composition and situation.
---
If it's minor can't you just make the changes manually, assuming it takes just as little effort to do so than scroll through a list of builds to find the right one?
---
Where else is someone meant to voice their opinion and give anet feedback outside of their forums?
---
&gt; For your convenience, all existing characters will have the first three Build Templates prepopulated with the skills, specializations, and traits from PvE, PvP, and WvW—one for each game mode.
---
So, basically if you don't pay them, you got no templates at all, and you also have to manually change builds when entering pvp/wvw.
---
It would have been so easy to add a few check boxes to associate builds with pve/pvp/wvw zones to auto swap, it was already in the game, lol.
---
They try to centralise equipement/builds to one place, but the pvp rune/amulet selection is still on its own separate place and i guess anet said fuck pvp, we do not extend equipment templates for that, the mode is trash anyway.
---
Equipment templates makes it really annoying to transfer gear from one character to another, cause you have to unlink it to be able to move it. Might as well change ascended gear to character bound from account bound. Also, fuck people with legendary gear.
---
And finally build storage: what is this even supposed to be? You can have a few extra talent/utility presets but the use is clunky, since using it requires you to overwrite one of the build template slots, so you can accidentally erase an existing build not saved in build storage.
---
tl;dr: Fuck game modes, fuck pvp especially, fuck alts, fuck legendary gear.
---
ArenaNet can i have yesterdays game version back please? It was better, even without ArcTempaltes.
---
All one needs is shelter, food, water and clothing. Let's agree that giving people this feature will likely get them to use them and maybe even diversify their gameplay. Not to mention that everyone can use the extra bag space.
---
I know it's 6 per character. IMO that really doesn't matter much considering you can store up to 24 in storage. The account storage should still be more than 24 (and free imo) but that's a whole different can of beans.
---
&gt;24 slots isn't much help if you're already needing more than 6 per character.
---
What are you even talking about? You just load a template from storage onto one of your 3 template slots. You don't need more template slots on each character, those are just quick change loadouts. As long as you have the template saved in storage, just load it onto a template slot.
---
Ever heard of raids buddy? I constantly have to switch on what is needed for a comp(all except alac builds). first world problems my ass. I’m also sure  it’s not only from raids either.
---
Just checked.  Seems it is still in the alpha stage?  I'm waiting for it to reach version 1.0 at least.
---
this has to be a troll post, I refuse to believe otherwise
---
Well that's not gw2s fault. That's elitist gamers fault.
---
2 years worth of a subscription for 7 years of gameplay sounds like a pretty good deal to me. Even factoring in the cost of the game and expacs at full price only adds about a year. Consider that a FF or WoW sub for that same duration would be over $1,000, not including any additional purchases.
---
Skills and text files are not equivalent to database entries / inventory items, and I'm so very tired of trying to explain this to people. 
---
A quick swap feature that can fail to load your weapon because you accidentally put it in storage, causing you to die because you had no way of getting out of combat, would be a failure of a system from a usability perspective. That's really the end of it: anet would never release such a system, it's against their design principles.
---
You don't HAVE to. You want to.
---
BRB, downloading a chat code manager.
---
You don't understand, I have 39 characters each with 3 sets of Legendary Armor and Sigils and 436 unique builds for any conceivable situation, so if ANet isn't catering to me and the other 37 guys in my situation, they can get fucked.
---
Idk mate, one of gw2's biggest selling points is the fact that there is no constant gear grind and the easily unlockable abilities/traits, which enables you to create many different builds for many different situations. Implementing a feature like templates is wonderful for such a game, but not if it's clunky and super pricey to use.
---
And talking down the needs and wishes of other people just because you don't feel the same is generally a bit sad, but that's just my opinion ^^
---
 Arc dps templates were free and better done. Sorry anet but your templates are a shame.
---
There are statistics on this.
---
800 gold to max out equipment templates per character
---
300 gold to max out build slots per character.
---
I won't be getting the build slots as guild messages exsist and I've already got a bank guild ready but 800 gold is still a pretty penny. 
---
Assuming only doing fractals, it's about 1 month worth of fractal gold.
---
About 1.2 months of raid gold. 
---
And about 55 total game hours worth of farming open world at a medium efficiency (20g/hr)
---
I will not buy more gems anytime soon (unless a dracolich skyscale skin drops, that's my only weakness) and I won't be for this feature but I will likely unlock the equipment templates for gold.
---
Lmao you clearly have never raided; and that's okay, but please understand that certain mechanics almost require certain builds. That's just how it is.
---
I've never used templates from Arc, just because it was a third party feature. I was freaking waiting for it in game... This fact made ArcDPs much more negligeable because just like me, some people just waited for official solution... 
---
Now i regret the official solution and i regret the GW1 system.
---
Congratulations on getting butthurt over a clearly flippant comment
---
GW2 has the better combat system, but game is dead (alive only for monetization).  So much better others game like FF.
---
I already have a working system for keep buildings. All that's going to change with Anet's cash-grab is using their copy links to make my own system more convenient.
---
[Actually not, nope.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dot7ua/build_templates_and_the_inconvenient_convenince/)
---
The more you're invested in the game, the worse the system is for you. Tragically funny.
---
Chronomancer will always be good in PvE because of its versatility and ability spam potential w/ Continuum Split.
---
You just have to communicate with your mates what your build is and what you're bringing to the table when you're playing support builds.
---
Here, legendary armor owners, have 2 equipment templates and a middle finger! Don't forget to buy gems!
---
That's one of the best parts of GW2 though. Messing and tweaking builds to suit different situations. That's a huge part of the fun of the game to me.
---
censored btw kek
---
They can go and fuck themselves. It's just PR. We were giving them feedback for the past 2 FUCKING WEEKS for what?
---
You can my friend but only for 6 builds and only if you pay $$$ 
---
What i'm saying is, we have 2 templates, and i need to swap to something other than the 2, i can't go to my bags or somewhere else to swap, i need to actually destroy my saved build template to grab the legendary back.
---
Any conflict that comes down to "vote with your wallet" is always going to be lost when it comes to mtx. Cuz the money comes from minority, not majority. Obviously I won't buy them, but it won't matter either way. That's the reality of the situation. The only things that seem to work are giant PR harming shitstorms and even that doesn't always bring results and lasting change is even more rare.
---
&gt; You still have all three load-outs, and now you can use them for whatever gamemode you want. In addition to have gear storage.
---
The classic "Gtg" U got un every raid but your lfg was clear "FC wing 1 2 3". The dude leaves after sabetha.
---
Why not buy them? I love them. Buying as many as I can!
---
He's complaining that it hasn't changed. Gear templates would be much better if you didn't have to unequip gear and send it to the other character via bank.
---
They've recently announced that their stance is different on 3rd party. They will never tell you it's okay because that means they'd have to commit to overhead to make sure it doesn't do anything that violates ToS. You can still use 3rd party stuff so long as you accept the responsibility if the developer puts weird shit in it that violates ToS.
---
That's gonna be a no from me. lmao
---
To be fair, I just converted gold to gems. So somebody else payed the money. :)
---
I actually had a 2nd Mesmer some time ago, and then I deleted it, because I could just use ArcDPS build templates for ease. I bought a bag slot or two, to hold the gear, and reverted to using 1 character.
---
Foresight level 0 on this.
---
 You do make a good point. If they could just make an easier version of each raid similar to how ff14 does it think it would be much better for people to get into. I’m no elite raider myself so I’m aware how they are.
---
Why would you want to equip another weapon when you already has a legendary weapon? Why don't you change a sigil instead of changing the whole weapon?
---
In just one sentence: Anet has failed to its players.
---
or, if you buy all the upgrades, just 2 builds available per mode.
---
fully agree, this would make the world of difference to me. but they wouldnt because $$$
---
Nein
---
Well its Not they Just Made the layers visible and usable now and added 3
---
You can See this pretty good Bye the fact that These "templates" dont realy save a specific build but save all Changes you Made directly its Just the Same as before but with ui 
---
Just Like Equipment "Templates" are the normal Equipment Hero Panel Interface that has No real save function times 2 with ui
---
Only real Work is in accountwide templates
---
The short little pauses between fights (where you can mount up) will be enough to hit that hotkey swap. They sometimes last only a second or two between mobs, or maybe 10 between phases in an event, and that's plenty of time to swap builds but short enough that you very well might not notice that you suddenly don't have a weapon equipped.
---
ok maybe my example was not perfect, but what if i want to equit lets say a scepter instead of a sword and swap back... then my sigils are also gone
---
&gt; I like GW2 but how does this team of 200 people pump out such little content? It’s getting harder for me to justify supporting Anet, so how do you guys do it?
---
FFXIV has income from subs, as well as other titles being published by Square which are... pretty objectively more widely praised and profitable than NCSoft titles, especially considering they have more of a focus on single player titles which don't take quite as much continued maintenance or development fees after launch, compared to all of NCSofts titles which are primarily MMOs. 
---
On top of that, development culture is very different in Japan vs. the US, which isn't to say it's a good or acceptable thing that things are the way they are for ArenaNet, but treatment of employees and work ethic is very different in both cultures.
---
And, you said yourself that FFXIV has currently 240 employees and GW2 has 200. Even if GW2 had 300 or so prior to layoffs, we know now after the fact that those folks weren't even working on GW2 directly but on new, unannounced titles, so it's just a fact that the team is smaller in terms of manpower. It makes sense that a smaller team will put out less content.
---
Even dungeons get pretty damn picky and elitist
---
If the community didn't start out like this from before the game launched, maybe they would have gone through a different route of designing things
---
Then you’re all set!
---
Give it three days and the perpetually angry will have tired of yelling at clouds. 
---
'Till then, vocal minorities are for ignoring.
---
So you agree that if you play all 3 game modes, then this update doesn't deliver anything, right?  
---
This update that is being marketed as a feature that has been heavily requested in the history of this game since launch, underdelivers on all aspects of it, except for the most casual players.
---
Manually swapping legendary gear can take considerably longer than swapping regular gear because you need to make all the choices you did with regular gear (select stats, insert rune/sigil, insert infusion) every single time; additionally you are locked into one fashion set. In exchange you have more flexibility, that benefit is not going away. Finally, legendary gear used to save inventory space, an important motivation why people crafted armor and gear templates nullify that advantage.
---
Initially legendaries were pure fashion, then Anet started adding convenience value to it (rune/sigil swapping etc.), now they are somewhat taking that convenience value away again. I believe that many people are mad not because they are worse off per se but because they would be equally well off in many aspects described above if they had not gotten legendary items in the first place. I think that in economic terms, the opportunity cost (value of the best alternative to your actual decision) of legendary gear has increased because everyone BUT owners of legendary gear are substantially better off and owners of legendary gear are more or less the same, so it feels (!) like you lost out.
---
Another issue is that Anet somewhat pushed themselves into a corner regarding endgame rewards - they don't want a gear treadmill so they need to find something else that acts as a carrot for veterans in Raids, Fractals and WvW. For some time, legendary gear promised that with the added convenience (flexibility, inventory space,...) and now the ultimate reward of those game modes is less interesting, so why invest so much into endgame content?
---
Personally, I have crafted 8 legendary sets so far, nothing but legendary weapons on my mains, about to complete that with legendary runes/sigils, yet I have 6 bank characters' inventory filled with nothing but unused ascended weapon and armor chests because being able to have the perfect gear without cluttering inventory and swapping on the fly felt nice. Now, I can get the same by dusting off those ascended gear boxes, so why did I spend tens of k of gold on legendary gear? Not sure. ^^ And people like me are a loud minority on reddit/forums, yet of course a minority, I am sure Anet knows this and that's why they don't care too much about the content of my first paragraph (although I think the second one should worry them if they are interested in the longevity of this game).
---
Sorry for the long wall, I hope this puts it into perspective.
---
But then there is no use of the template when I have to switch back trinkets, backpice etc... Plus I can't save the builds if you use legendary armor on more char.. plus when you right click it and unequip it put out all infusions
---
It's definitely an overall improvement but I feel they could've done a better job if they made the account templates free &amp; unlimited by storing the builds locally. You can already do that by copy/pasting but it's not practical. If it's already possible, why not just make it part of the template system to store locally? The only other upgrade would be an option to set up which build template is loaded automatically based on your game mode.  
---
I'm not going to compare it to GW1 templates or Arcdps as we've all heard those arguments a million times already. But yeah, overall good update. It just needs more work.
---
&gt;  free up inventory space.
---
This takes gear out of inventory? I haven't checked it yet.
---
opening lots of ToT bags gives lots of limited-use finishers (I have around 15,000 myself.  I just delete them now though)
---
They also made swapping the sets to other alts much more tedious, because now we have to remove the armor from all the templates, and set them back up later when they’re returned, because the game doesn’t save the legendary armor configurations on each template if you remove it.
---
What dye is that turquoise colour on your armor?
---
I took it to mean like bag slot vs. bank slot
---
NCsofts quarterly results for GW2. They’ve been mostly stable. There was a drop from Q3 to Q4 in 2018. Q1 in 2019 was up and then Q2 2019 slight down higher higher than Q4 in 2018.
---
I’m not sure how that would differ from “Anets results”? Honestly, I am not sure what you are referring to here, sorry.
---
this so much, returning to the old system even without arctempaltes would be an improvement...
---
Veterans just lost the arc templates
---
This is a dumpster fire lol
---
You're a nut. The guy doesn't talk about final fantasy anywhere
---
It doesn't cover the basics imo. My main atm is locked to the same 3 builds that I used before. I was looking forward to experiment more with the builds and various gear but I got depressed when I logged in and saw the limits. It defeats the purpose of having the build templates in the game.
---
/channels inner Jim Sterling
---
"PLAYER CHOICE. IT'S OPTIONAL."
---
Did you actually try it? Because you save an item for 1 template (load out), not for all of them.
---
As nice as it would be, the concept of voting with your wallet has never deterred any shitty decision made by any MMO company.
---
is anyone except our great casual community actually surprised about that?
---
I thought you were referring to the general NCSoft results and not to the gw2 specific results.
---
&gt; A big difference about loadout is that whatever change you may do to it will remain stored/saved so if you needed to swap a few pieces of gear or te re-stat some leg gear you can't go back easily/directly to your initial state because it does not exist anymore.
---
Ah, I see now. Yes, that's a consequence of having the templates / loadouts fixed to a hot-swap system, you have to have the current state be saved in order to hot-swap back to it. I suppose you could always copy your current loadout to a different template slot before tinkering with it in your current slot....but that takes another build slot, so that's not going to happen often.
---
Anyway, I see why you're drawing the distinction now, thanks.
---
They also aren't as wildly overpriced as some people are making them out to be. Unlocking all six Equipment Template slots on a single character costs 2000 gems, exactly the same price as unlocking all ten Bag slots, a price we've been entirely OK with since the game launched. The Build slots are an extra 900 gems on top of that, but you also start with more of them, plus the storage slots. It's not like they're asking us to pay through the nose for this or something, especially considering most players won't even need more than the starting slots for most of their characters; by comparison, unlocking all your Bank tabs costs 9600 gems, and storage expanders can run you up to 5600 (for reference, unlocking all the Build Storage slots will cost 3500, 3000 if you take advantage of the freebie).
---
That's 1 way of playing. I do most of the stuff with my ranger main and the templates are basically useless unless I pay for extra slots.
---
I wasn’t asking for the same caliber of releases but something even in the same realm? It just seems like we are being drip fed content. 
---
The game is great for new players because there is a ton of stuff to do. But the vets don’t have so much anymore and it seems that the only thing to look forward to is LS.
---
Agreed. If this were changed, I think it would solve a lot of the problems folks have with the current monetization system put in place. It's the fact that I have to make the same purchase multiple times across all my characters that's the real kicker.
---
Dye templates coming to a gemstore near you! Only 600 gems!
---
Just curious: does entering a gamemode swap automatically our template combo ( build/equip ) or do we also have to do it manually?
---
Because that's gonna be very bad, especially if you mix dailies.
---
Such an amazing sale.
---
You shouldn't draw out ideas like strawmen when your own response is so full of fallacies. I don't think that helps make your point tbh.
---
It doesn't change automatically, i tested it.
---
how come they couldn't adopt delta's way of handling build templates?, it generated no server impact that we knew of while being a complete upgrade over their templates.
---
Well, the "bunch" is only 3200 gems and I got them via gold-&gt;gems exchange. I just used the gems a whale turned into gold. :)
---
However, even though I don't think the monetisation is the perfect solution, I won't stop myself from using this feature. 
---
And since I use gold-&gt;gem exchange to get gems most of the time, the extra slots are just an additional reason to get gold -&gt; play the game for me. 
---
I know it's not the common view of this, but at least *I* am 'okay' with it.
---
Disagree completely with not supporting games put out from chinese companies. There are a huge number of games out there that have nothing to do with China. The issues surrounding Hearthstone right now are there for a reason. We have a choice about the companies we support, and recommending someone a game from a Chinese company is an ethical decision I can't support. Not to mention, if the OP is fed up with the devs being hardheaded and greedy, recommending a game from a company with $60 cosmetic outfits, releases a new mechanic every 3 months in a broken alpha state, and outright disregards community feedback on important game mechanics (trade) hardly seems like a good idea.
---
Nah I just recognize it’s a genuinely well designed and written MMO that has better business practices than Anet. When you outright neglect large portions of your playerbase, competitors that don’t are bound to come up in conversation.
---
I've never had all bank tabs unlocked on any of my 9 characters, so I didn't spend those gems, and I'm not spending them here either.
---
Gems to gold and the fact that most ppl don't have that many builds do not excuse the fact that this is the specific cash pricing point that anet chose for maxing this feature.
---
Thank you for your amazing work.
---
why would they even make it server side?, is it a monetization friendly idea to do so?

Context is being lost, sorry, i'm not talking about op issue, i'm talking about a different issue. How legendaries is useless even if you don't want to swap between characters, i mean that if you want to use your legendary for anything other than the template you saved, you NEED to undo all of them lol
---
Most of the devs in Anet are working on gem store skins.
---
ah, ok. So Anet just needs to add two blues and a green as reward for swapping your build
---
Nah, it wouldn't have been.
---
For anyone looking for charr in this link, there are none.
---
its ok, strait people like you can be clowns in it too.
---
for most people it would be better if they dont play at all and fix their RL. so personally i shouldnt recommend games for ethical reasons.
---
outfits in PoE are not a mandatory gamefeature. if you would complain about the prices for a banktab.. but those are quite fair for what they deliver and very often in sale.
---
i also wouldnt say broken alpha state. sure, the releases always had some problems, but that applies to gw also.
---
for trade, chris stated long time ago, that they wont have a TP. personally i would love it, BUT before we get a TP that is shit or monetized i prefer to whisper people. i mean.. we just saw in gw what happens when people want something and the companie isnt able to deliver in the way all hoped. and in terms of league mechanics they listened to feedback. after synth (which i quitted after 2 weeks because it was absolute trash) they made legion, which was fun (but shit out too much worthy drops imho)
---
Yes, it is actually worse, i'd rather go back to the old version, without build/equipment templates, even without arctemplates. Just play a little, try to change up a few weapons, swap out a few gear pieces from berserker to assasins because you don't have spotter in the team, try to play pvp, try to move gear to another character. And this is not even with legendary gear.
---
I would even pay gems to return to the old system...
---
I don't play more than one game mode so I don't care. PvP and WvW is irrelevant.
---
I don't think any come to mind right now, Anet does it by rolling the new versions progressively while keeping current servers running, and then slowly switching them all up to the new version, it's really quite amazing when you think about it, and a wonder no other MMO/online service is doing it.

Only that this won't have generated as much profit they hope the current system will generate.

No.

aww man I have to change my pet with arc? can't wait for anet's templates
---
[My main is crying](https://gw2efficiency.com/c/Dana%20Kashin) and so am I... Yea I guess I might actually stop playing now cos I just can't be arsed. Legendary gear with QoL... yeah, right.
---
Iirc that just gives you a check point in front of the boss so you can all reset there instead of having to jump through the caves so they actually sorta saved you time?
---
Dude that was fast.
---
Donating as soon as I get home tonight!
---
i thought the leggings and chest were awesome, but the boots, hands, shoulders and head pieces are ugly feathers
---
then you switched to asura and i burst out laughing.
---
That's exactly what it is, and isn't the first time we got this exact number showing up.
---
It's funny, i've seen several discord now talking about able to duplicate infusions. Doesnt work on sellable one luckily (or we would have to get a rollback coz ez ECS you know). But technically, you could dupe other like FotM, moto and such, still too early to be confirmed. :d
---
Slow down with your rational and cool-headed analysis and grab a pitchfork like the rest of reddit
---
usually this subreddit doesnt allow double-posts of links and automatically redirects you to the already existing thread, if you try to post it again, which didnt happen, when i posted this. I guess its because the other link actually linked the 2nd page of the forum post, not the first comment. But I deleted this anyways, less work for the mods.
---
And then they started charging for it!
---
\*EAnet now.
---
Problem is that not enough people do this.
---
This.
---
Isnt the three build slots you have per character by default one from PvE, one from PvP and one from WvW. Just how they told us. At least that is how it looks on my Warrior which mainly plays WvW, but does have a separate build in PvE.
---
I like it.  It's a very well done new feature
---
Because the game has stopped producing a lot of content and they need to monitize what they do create.
---
I think what the op wants other than more content that would equal that of what other MMOS are providing is a specific roadmap. Roadmaps are cool and pretty helpful for things like MMOS. It would be nice if ANET gave us a small idea is whats ahead other than the saga. To be honest with WOW's next expansion sitting on the horizon it would be cool for ANET to give a roadmap, since certain people enjoy playing multiple MMOS.
---
they shouldn't even be monetised, but if anet want to jump down into the same boat as EA, activision, bethesda and countless others, who are we to stop them?
---
Well you don't see me going to that subreddit and pretending to be outraged there.
---
If I had to guess, I would imagine it would be hard for them to do this for just the Templates, or in a way that doesn't let you link things together in weird ways. A more elegant solution would probably be better for everyone in the long term.
---
How would that work with soulbound gear?
---
15k gems waiting for an actual offer.
---
Wait koda warmth too? How?????

---
To be fair, that\_shaman does avoid posting spoilers in these posts. I'd bet there's quite a few things that would constitute such. So while we don't get an episodic release, we won't get much more than gemstore stuff.
---
That\_shaman tends to put more spoilery additions on his twitter, like [the new mastery background](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1184193589569642497), or [a certain crystal dragon's new model](https://imgur.com/a/vbcquq1).
---
There is some method to dupe infusions, haven't seen how and wouldn't share either but it's there.
---
Same, uninstalled the gamed last week.
---
REDDIT. IS. NOT. THE. WHOLE. COMMUNITY. Have a wonderful day.
---
Well not so many soulbound gear out there these days
---
Diddo brother
---
or guild msg
---
I am quite sure you can name the gear ones as well?
---
that guy is a well known white knight and he loves to spout outright lies while trying to gaslight you, i'm not surprised he bought into this, he is exactly the type of customer anet wants lol.
---
GW2 is a good game. I think people were just expecting way too much after the layoff. I am looking forward to the first episode of the saga. At the same time if ANET did a roadmap for next year it would super awesome. I have also noticed a lot of people wanting GW3 to happen and people just hating on stuff to hate on it.
---
Nice to think that im pretending because in genuinely annoyed a game I used to love has gone down a shitty path. Are we not allowed to be unhappy or should we all be good corporate shills.
---
"Oh yes anet. Please rip me off more. Yes anet. Please make the game worse and I'll gladly pay you for it. Thank you anet for losing staff by the bucket load and forcing us to financially pay for your bad game design."
---
We're unhappy and we have a right to be vocal about it.
---
I think you could just save your build template in a txt file by copying the code
---
Yeah, but only if you can survive walking on the lava until you reach the boss's arena.
---
There are some tricks to doing that, mainly hitting the ledges on the wall to don't take as much fall damage.
---
hello hyperbole my old friend, i've come to talk with you again
---
yes you can
---
Fuck Anet.
---
It's possible a broken sarcasm detector is to blame. Anet will probably sell you one for 2000 gems.
---
you can name the gear aswell, its only shown when you hover over it. what kinda bothers me is, that when you call be build lets say "Pwr Fbd Quickbrand" the copied code still only says: Firebrandbuild
---
If you want to create a backup of your current equipped equipment dyes you could use https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Template:Account_appearance_summary_widget + then save the output to a text file or something.
---
You can.
---
you're literally paying for this game to go further down the shitter, go for it lmao
---
Didn't people not want to use Arc because they were afraid of it deleting their gear (even though I used it for almost 2 years and never lost a single piece along with not a single person I know losing a piece)?  Oh the irony
---
They can earn it through other avenues. Doing it through gameplay systems sucks.
---
In a month we will be all happy. I would like a shortcut for build plus equip but it is ok for me as it is now. Love the patch
---
what /u/Lunateric said ... 
---
&gt;lol
---
&gt;you have to make every race fit on it and have their elbows touch the arm rests or else their pose would just float
---
[Hmm?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Desert_King_Throne_human_male.jpg)

[Hmmm....](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Bench_of_the_Final_Judge_norn_female.jpg)

[Hmm.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Pirate_Captain%27s_Chair_norn_female.jpg)
---
Yeah I call bullshit on that. Elbows do *not* need to touch the ends of chairs. Sometimes they make sure hands do, but there are plenty of chairs in the game without armrests at all, such as [Bough of the Grove](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bough_of_the_Grove_Chair) in which the characters rest their arms on their legs - that same pose *can* be done on larger chairs for smaller races.
---
I legitimately can't tell anymore. But going off of post history, I don't think it was sarcasm.
---
nomegalul
---
I'm saying that 24 is a pathetically low number, especially for those of us that would have use for all 6(or 3, or w/e) per-char slots.
---
If each character has 6 builds, 24 isn't going to be very helpful considering the game has 9 classes.
---
&gt; much more simple and friendly ui than anet...
---
Eh, I've heard a lot of praise for arcdps, but simple and friendly is not one of them.
---
Anything character bound in 2020 is just plain bad for both the game and the player base as a whole and the future of the game. 
---
I have been saying this for years. Don't put roadblocks in front of utility in your games or you will lose your players faster and make them resent you even if you make some money in the short term.
---
I really like this game but I hate how it monetizes everything at the expense of fun and enjoyment or even gameplay in terms of wanting to play to get something worth getting. Most of the in game rewards are shit while the nicest stuff is locked behind BLC RNG gotcha chests and Gemstore. As much as I love so much about this game I never recommend it to anyone because of this fucking paywall that it presents in the guise of "convenience". It's actually cheaper to just pay the 14.99 WOW sub then to get into GW2 for 3 years and be on the same level in terms of having access to all the game's rewards, skins, items, and outfits/skins and utility items.
---
GW2 with all its Gemstore bs is getting to a point that despite how nice it is, the moment something new and/or equally good hits the market everyone will be gone. There is a lot of bitter people who aren't just the minority, but the ones who shelled out the money to support the game. 
---
There are just not enough in-game rewards, not enough in-game new items/gear, incentives that aren't locked behind mountains of grind/collections or gemstore to stick around or keep getting invested unless you just sit around town and fashion war.
---
This shit needed to be account bound and monetized in a more balanced manner. Yet Anet as always are a bunch of greedy fucks with no concept of give and take in terms of striking a balance between what can be done vs. what should be done.
---
Did ya read the thread at all? It has all the information
---
There will be another character slot sale in 2 months, just sit on your hands until then. Personally i don't think they will make ANY changes to build templates, optimisation was a low secondary consideration after monetising.
---
I blame the poncho PR guy from the saga presentation now i can't blame Mo any more :D
---
he's a shill, don't expect consistency or logic in anything other than his defence of indefensible practises.
---
Finally another outfit with booty game
---
You can but it only show if you mouseover... kinda bad design
---
Implying every line you wrote is equal in importance like any other.
---
I could easily make more lines green on either side if I wanted to highlight what I want. For example, Arcdps templates are account bound, makes legendaries worth, can combo build/equip templates, allows easy minute swapping.
---
This table is like corporates telling you that the Ultimate Edition of the game is so much worth the price.
---
wish arc templates duped infusions on launch too, I like that kind of misbehaving.
---
Say what you will, one dude's opinion is another's shame. 
---
My thoughts with arcdps' ui was incredibly well thought out and organised
---
i love you
---
Yep, same as anet ones.
---
Be sure you don't use these new features either, right?  For consistency?
---
Thats because theres no memory allocated for anything less than 0. So they can use the entire space for positive integers.
---
It's impossible to have a negative amount of gems, so they don't bother assigning memory to tracking it, which frees up half of the slots. eg. and unsigned 32. bit integer. The unsigned bit meaning it doesn't track negative intigers.
---
its not just about 500 gems, people who actually want to optimize for every encounter would need to pay over 400 $ if they use like 9 chars.
---
Also an ingame affecting feature to this degree is something else then an optional skin.
---
Right, and this system is how it was in GW1 and it worked great. I wish they would have just stuck with that tbh.
---
Someone should send this to Jimquisition xD
---
I thaught the whole Problem ist that ppl want to die IT manually but dont want the Templates to Change when they do..
---
I'm pretty sure this did not start overnight and was more progressive. Some people are really annoying with the way they complain but there is some very legit concerns and criticism to have, dismissing them all because you don't like the way some people complain looks a bit off to me. You're probably not hanging in all the corners of this sub because there are very frequent positive messages about the game and people are complaints are frequently framed around the fact that this really will affect people who have a lot of playtime and are very much used to end-game content.
---
Also lol to bieng downvotted on my previous comment, looks like some people just can't do both afterall.
---
Your argument is so dumb it literally hurt me reading it. This shit isn't even worth arguing with, if you don't get this one simple thing:
---
Just because you don't need features does not mean nobody does. These features were intended for those who need them. Nothing would be taken away from you if there were more templates available. Your opinion on the matter is therefore invalid. You have no place even bringing an argument into this discussion except blatantly defending anets bad decisions for personal reasons that have nothing to do with the implementation of that feature, but rather come from a misguided idea of tribalism.
---
So in short: Shut up and go fuck yourself.
---
Thank you for your feedback, it will be put into consideration for next release.
---
This system is great for me, and I have a need of it, and I've logged in and played every day for the last year and a half or so.  🤷‍♀️
---
Why didn't you allow gear to be pulled from character inventory bags? 
---
I still fail to see why this isn't an option.
---
is Teapot streaming right now?
---
1 comment later he's telling the 2 who replied that he converted gold to gems to buy, haha, not exactly one of our brightest players
---
Free offerings?
---
What?
---
Can you stop blindly white knighting for anet?
---
We already had 3 build templates for WvW, PvE and PvP before this and they also could swap automatically.
---
Those "free" build templates are just those we already had because the backslash would be even bigger if they take away from what we already had ingame ...
---
I think I shoud give DeltaConnected the money I wanted to give anet. At least he did a good job for 2 years in which we had useful templates.
---
I only wish one of those YouTubers who cover these type of things actually notices this. People like YongYea, TheQuartering, Angry Joe, Upper Echelon, Jim Sterling etc.
---
Because no one really gives a damn about farming these.
---
Its 4 events on a schedule which consumes a lot of time most people dont want to invest for a chance at something rare.
---
I'm excited to spend the day setting up templates for all my toons.  This is going to be a fantastic day.  I've been waiting for build templates forever, and now I also get gear templates AND free bag space.  Just really can't wait to get off work and log in and play!
---
I kinda feel like "a shame" is a too light word for the pile of steaming shit they delivered. Seriously 2 years anet. Sorry but I have no words for the amount of disappointment I feel about their iteration of "templates".
---
This is why consulting your high end players on new forced functions that affect them is extremely important and yet ANet decided to say "fuck QA here you go"
---
Yes but how many clicks ?
---
&gt; WITHOUT having to send it
---
A lot of players were expecting this and I don't know why. Anet said multiple times that gear will not be shared between characters. That would devalue so much gear and is just a insane idea without any thought put into it.
---
Racist and sexist.. You must be well liked...
---
Thats a little sexist and racist, dontcha think?
---
You can equip your legendary from the Hero menu &gt; Equipment tab, even if it's in use in other templates.
---
Any equipment/utility change you make now is modifying whatever template you have on.
---
For me the worst offender is equipment templates, should have been less limited, a starting point of 3 would have worked long ways into making it seem like they are less money hungry.
---
I'll still pay for cosmetic stuff, but being an old Guild Wars 1 player, a system i got for free that is now behind a paywall is very bothersome to me. I have to say that I'll refrain from purchasing anything related to builds, sorry.
---
You don't care that they removed your automatic WvW loadout that loaded automatically when you entered the game mode to replace it with a "free" template that you have to manually change every time you enter the mists?
---
Thats not really comparable with selling an ingame feature of one of the last valuable ingame rewards over the gemstore now, while more and more of the game are put behind the gemstore the last year.
---
NEIN NEIN NEIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama or violating the CoC is not allowed.
---
Yeah, the sunk cost fallacy is a similar scenario although if I remember correctly, it describes future investment decisions but you are certainly right by stating that it is not a rational motivation.
---
However, while specific behaviour or emotions might not be rational they still exist. I would also be cautious of implicitly equating rational with justifiable and irrational with not justifiable - the sunk cost fallacy describes a situation that can and should be judged purely in economic terms with no emotions attached, where said equation works. Economic concepts are great for analysing and in my eyes less good for value judgements.
---
The whole template rage might not be rational and you are right in assessing that a certain side of it is rather petty but from an empathetic angle it is understandable I'd say - someone worked hard and now everybody is getting the same for free. (If you stretch it real far maybe you could draw a parallel to one of the criticisms of extended welfare systems or unconditional basic income.) Overall I'd say it works as an explanation of why people are angry as we are ultimately talking about feelings of fairness, explanation purely in the literal sense, with no justification or value judgement implied.
---
And just for the record, I def support welfare systems. :) There might be logical missteps in my thoughts, if so please point them out!
---
it also ate one of mine. ARC never did that sooo
---
I sincerely hope you’re wrong because I will not be happy. 500 gems per gear template is so overpriced when GW1 had it for free. Also if you look at other MMO’s, they don’t charge for stuff like build templates. If you want to max out gear Templates on every class, you’re looking at around $240. Are you honestly telling me that is ok?
---
If you use racial transmogs then legendary armor is even worse. Legendary armor makes little sense in GW2 - by the time you earn it you have enough ascended to build multiple builds anyway. Now you just dump them all into gear templates anyway. The system is built terribly to handle the value of legendaries, but it's great for people who use lots of ascended (until you run into other problems, like WvW and PvP builds).
---
I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds like whoever was in charge of templates wouldn't even be qualified to bring in the carts at Walmart.
---
i actually haven't played in a week so I have not touched the templates lol i only play an s/d thief really...but that sounds kind of annoying if I have to manually set my build back up each time I log in?
---
I never had a need for templates, so all this update has done is given me free storage for some of the extra gear I'd been lugging around, and now it requires me to manually swap builds when I zone my character from PvE to WvW/PvP, rather than having that happen automatically.
---
So just as the quote above states: I gain from this update, even though I can't say I need it, but from what I've read, this new system won't meet the needs of those who were previously using Arc templates.
---
But the takeaway is really this: stop worrying about it.  ARC templates will never return, and ANET is highly unlikely to rethink their approach to market here.  So, if after this patch you intend to continue playing the game, just accept this new reality, move on, and decide whether you will make do with the free slots they gave us, or that you will buy gems to get more.
---
Sorry, but we just need to face the reality this is a done deal - chewing over it and getting angry isn't going to solve any of the issues here.
---
Yes I do. I already spent the 800 gems per character slot. I already invested and supported the game since release. Its the gear storage I have a problem with. Why was gear not taken from inventory as an option? I will hold the gear in my bags and not use any storage. Wheres the problem in that? I will tell you where, its not 500 gems per character, that's where.
---
My favorite is when one experienced raider jumps in on the training raid and says “clearly this is not happening” after an 8% first pull and leaves
---
Nope
---
The selfawareness of getting fucked over by anet because instead of having free build templates through arcdps i now have to use this shitty dumbed down version that i actually have to pay for since i dont just run around in the open world with my soldier gear?
---
Then how will I get my shillbucks?
---
Find some other bandwagon to get outraged over, you fucking sheep. It's like you see a big orange arrow next to an opinion and you assume its the right one. You have no concept of anything resembling knowledge of the industry, competitive pricing models, or sustainability. You think you are entitled to something because your mommy never told you that things have value and take effort to create.
---
we DID say "man I'd PAY in the gem store of they'd give us build templates" for like four years
---
Go back to making disgusting comments on porn subs you troglodyte.
---
Yeah they said so in the video stream
---
this is censorship and violates freedom of speech, u can tag it as drama, but that subjective.
---
You can save 3-2-3 2-2-1 2-3-1 in a notepad too
---
I was pugging the T3 Shattered Observatory rec several months ago and ran into a Bearbow Soulbeast that admitted that she enjoyed watching other people suffer.  I was literally playing with Satan.
---
Gear templates punish people that have legendary sigils. If you swap your weapons during a raid/dungeon/fractal once you equip back your previews weapons you will no longer have the legendary sigils on. Happened to me in fractals, trying to precast stuff and I ended with no sigils on my weapons.
---
That's why I don't play anymore. For a veteran player there's nothing to do but farming the same dungeons, fracs, raids and events each week for a few gold to buy the latest gemstore stuff. There is nothing interesting to drop/buy/farm ingame except a few select items which are so rare, it's not even worth it to try.
---
Just tested. My warrior is parked in Armistice Bastion. Logged in, checked, changed builds between the three different ones, went to PvE, builds still there. Went back to WvW, builds still there.
---
r/woosh
---
I’ve heard it’s more cost efficient than buying upfront. I really don’t have a lot of dust and I need it for the leggy so I don’t want to be too liberal with my use of it, but I’ll do it a few times before I go to buy:)
---
nice for your years of work on this site (even how negative this current system is received it still a bless)
---
There's the effect.  Thanks!
---
Wtf build templates should be separate between game modes!
---
He has 500coffers
---
&gt; What has released in GW2 in that time frame? 
---
Back in 2017, Path of Fire was released in September, two months later (in November) we got a new Living World episode including new map, new story, new items/collections, new raid wing and new fractal. So yeah, nothing was ever released in GW2 in that time frame (:
---
I don't think you understand my concern.
---
I haven't paid for anything from Anet in years. Because it's all either low quality or overpriced.
---
I agree that I had, before I significantly reduced my playtime, spent over 6000 hours on the game for not much more than the base prices.
---
My concern is that Anet is hemorrhaging money. The studio has made major layoffs, they've made the game expansions a bundle in an effort to encourage new players. They NEED our money.
---
But they are providing a shit product at excessive prices. Not the games themselves, but the gem store options. So you say "well then, don't buy anything! No one is forcing you to." And you are correct. I haven't bought anything. I am not a paying customer of Anet this year. *And that means Anet is doing something wrong.*
---
My problem is that they are going to sink themselves because not enough people are buying their overpriced products. And we will all risk losing development of our reasonably-priced fun game because of that.
---
I want Anet to provide desirable products at reasonable prices so that many people will purchase them and the studio doesn't fucking die. And Anet concerns me because I think they are, as they have been for years, making poor decisions which result in lower revenue.
---
&gt; This is a common issue with these kinds of comparisons and if I knew how to avoid it, I would have done it.
---
Then why create a comparison table like this in the first place? To give a proper overview you'd also have to write up a wall of text afterwards on how significant each of these points are and whether some of these features were even necessary or asked for. But by doing that you're then undermining the purpose of this table.
---
Yea, I'm looking at the chart and honestly Arcdps does more if you truly need unlimited temp. But since most player won't need more than 3 its really all about having the option. And honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if in a few months or a year Anet caves and makes an unlimited option for the same cost as 6 acroess the board for both gear and build temps. Just sayin.
---
Would you recommend starting FF over playing GW2? I know literally nothing about FF.
---
Thanks for responding. Yeah, I really just need to stop caring for things I can't get. Just kind of sucks having difficulties trying to get the really cool stuff.
---
Maybe I just need to start a new character. Go all the way to the beginning to remember the enjoyment of the basics.
---
image their 200 devs actually produce content like many other mmos can do
---
It's not as long for me, but yes, that's right. I also refuse to reward them for this crap with other people's money, i.e. gems bought for gold.
---
That works fine unless you want to swap builds on the fly or want to use the same equipment with different builds.
---
1) I did look, but the UI is quite different from the one for builds, which is stupid. Not a stretch to assume you can't when a similar ui is not there.
---
2) Did you rly need to dig a deleted post to comment on it ?
---
3) Read other comments before you comment, many other people already said the same
---
4) thanks for your toxicity
---
You sure it didn't just re-use another infusion of the same type in both gear templates in different spots? after equipping all my sets I got "refunded" a few infusions aswell because I use them in legendaries in build 1 and also in different legendaries in build 2. So it didn't duplicate anything
---
That's good, because your gold, if converted to gems, is just other people's money (and therefore still money thrown at them).
---
what do you think?
---
But you also had all your buildswap buttons in one window... now its like... some here, some there.
---
I happily download a dll every 3 months to get that back.
---
&gt;an example: if you use one legendary greatsword in multiple gear template slots they share the sigils and infusions on it. so far so good... now i want to, for example, equip a serpent slaying weapon for the nightmare fractal... that is totally possible ..
---
&gt;BUT: now if i want to swap manually back from my serpent slaying to my initial weapon which was shared throughout multiple templates it equips but has no sigils and no infusions on it anymore...
---
I'm confused, why does this happen exactly? Shouldn't the sigils remain on the weapon?
---
GW1 is not GW2
---
The top 1% complaining about a change designed to benefit the other 99%
---
With build storage I'd like to see an option to browse for a file that would contain a copy/paste code.
---
This would be in effect the same as maintaining a text file you are copying and pasting from, but a bit easier to manage.
---
That makes it even freaking WORSE! How!?
---
Rev is better suited to heal because fb does more dmg. Fb heals are stronger tho.
---
Lol okay buddy.
---
With less utility.
---
Whales: “Well, this *is* my only character...”
---
People like him are also the reason the game still exists.
---
They have more then enough money and that f2p argument so you can justify everything doesn't count anymore, since its just another payment model which often is much more effective then classic sub based they dont do f2p/pay2play with gemstore not out of pure good will.
---
Even ascended stuff lose a lot of advantage, just to reiterate anothe point, since minute changing is not only highly expensive but also kinda unrecommended.
---
Actual people that need swapping got their QoL much worse now.
---
If you're playing all three game modes on all of your characters then yeah, you're not getting any additional slots for free.
---
How many players is that? All four of them? Because WvW has been fairly unpopular for probably since the last tournament ended and one of the main complaints I keep reading about PvP is that there aren't enough players to fill people's queues.
---
I totally agree that these templates aren't what a lot of people, myself included, were looking for but this specific complaint seems to me like people who probably don't play that much PvP and WvW just try to find yet another reason to complain.
---
I’ve just purchased a few build templates for each of the 37 characters on my account (my mains, of course, and the 30 mesmers with all black dyes that I roleplay as my mains’ shadows). 
---
Really wanted to show love for arenanet for all the hard work they’ve put into content releases this year. Can’t wait for the next living story episode, and the season after that!
---
Comboing equip/traits/skills is something that I'd have included if I thought of it, good point, that was another great feature of arcdps templates.
---
You could either select gear, traits, skills with one click and equip it right away or you could mix and match gear, trait and skill templates freely which was very nice.
---
New level of elo hell
---
To be far, Anet did have a road map at one point and just stop posting about. And even if Anet started posting regular [quarterly updates](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/april-19-2016/) again I doubt it it would be the community at large. Unless its about WvW I careless and I know the schedule for the saga release. (2~ 3 months) Surely you can play other mmos knowing that little bit of info.
---
Don't buy anything in a ftp game and expect it to continue development on new content cus that's how money works 😎👉👉
---
There are no other mmo free comparable to gw2. At all. They need money to maintain it free. Stop complaining. 
---
The only real complain I have is there is no way to set a single shortcut to switch equip and armor at the same time
---
SHHHHHHH! I was just making 2 new alts goddammit.
---
&gt;invest
---
That’s your problem and that’s the problem a lot of other people who buy things with real money for MMOs have. You make the mistake of viewing money spent on the game as an investment instead of what it actually is, **a sunken cost**. Any money you spend on any MMO is a sunken cost, it doesn’t add any value to your account because you cannot legally sell it, you can’t eat it, it isn’t something tangible that you can keep forever, it’s not under any warranty if the MMO shuts down. 
---
Whether this sunken cost is acceptable or not is completely subjective, I spend approx $20 a month because there’s no subscription fee but I still want to support the continued running of GW2. As a bonus, I get to choose in-game rewards for that money that would otherwise just be subscription cost for another game. The main difference being that I don’t lose access to the game if I don’t feel like paying on any given month (which does happen.)   
---
I accept that this $20 monthly is pretty much money in the trash. If I quit GW2 and never log in again, if Anet decides to shut down it’s servers, if I get banned for any reason or no reason, it’s not like I’m losing some kind of investment, this money was never invested. It was always and will always be money that I spent while acknowledging that I would never see a dime of that money again and that it didn’t actually add any worth to my experience beyond temporary enjoyment of an in game good.
---
This isn’t the same as buying an antique that continues to build value with age and displaying it in your home. This isn’t buying stocks. This isn’t buying any kind of commodity really. You’re buying in game gems to use as currency to buy additional build slots beyond the two you already eat for free (if you buy them.)   
---
This is a sunken cost. It adds something to the game that **you feel** would increase your enjoyment of the game, but beyond that, you haven’t put your money towards anything of tangible value. You’re not **investing** in anything.
---
&gt; 90+ per cent of the community will benefit massively from that feature
---
Anyone who plays more than 1 gamemode already loses out on automatic gear swapping between pvp/wvw/pve which is annoying. If that someone has more than one character then oh boy the real trouble begins.
---
who? 
---
I think you owe me a "I deserved that joke, buddy!".
---
Will we get banned doing so? I wish o could do that do have some additional ar
---
Will do, thanks!
---
I'm confident I don't understand what you're trying to say, but that sounds like it's a bug, not a deliberate feature, if you're using the templates.
---
I agree, but partially. Tbh, sometimes when you end up solo carrying an inexp t4 group, it feels super rewarding. Like that time when me and heal tempest hugged each other and duo'd brazen gladiator with rest of the party dead at 40% or so. Or when you solo cap 3 circles at ensolyss cm at 33%.
---
But this does not go if I am in the mood for a fast and clean run before sleep.
---
Oh... I had my hopes. 
---
I don't like this.
---
Vote with your login. Don’t play the game. Those metrics are tracked I bet anything if not more than the money to make sure there is more to be had.
---
It's hate speech you dumb cunts. It's not a word you want to use the way OP did unless you want to come off as a complete asshole. [Here's some other folks thoughts about it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/why-you-shouldnt-use-the-r-word/2011/06/06/AGISc3nH_story.html) and [here's some history](https://medium.com/s/story/the-rise-and-fall-of-mentally-retarded-e3b9eea23018).   
---
&gt;Don’t use \["retarded" or\] “intellectually disabled” or “special needs,” as an insult, because *there’s nothing wrong with being intellectually disabled.*
---
But they live here.
---
&gt;Maybe legendary sigils can fix this problem,
---
they are in fact causing the same problem sadly...
---
of course they technically fix the problem, you have when you want to play different sigils for different encounters... but they don't fix the problem that you cannot just swap out a weapon for another just to swap the previous one back in without having sigils on it
---
in fact even if you have ascended weapons but legendary sigils you have the same problem since they can also be swapped out without cost
---
burnout
---
Getting into an understanding static/guild group is infinitely better if you have a the schedule/time for it.
---
I started in pugs/trainings for like a couple of weeks and exactly like this post I got tired of seeing people leave after one attempt and such. I used to go guild trainings too but they can't always accommodate everyone because of odd numbers. Some days I show up and I don't get picked for the day because of "RNG think of what number I'm thinking". Then I started looking into static groups and eventually settled into the third group (which was being newly formed at the time) I found and never looked back. I started with only real knowledge of 2½ bosses and one year later I now know all bosses, clear most wings weekly, and missing one raid achievement. On top of all of this I'm really anti-social so it's actually surprising to me that I got into raiding at all.
---
Thank you for the sourced info'
---
Looking at this great tool, it's clear that the system we have is incompleted.
---
Now we need ArenaNet to complete the system and give us actual build templates that are stored on disc through the game, including weapons, stats and upgrades. 
---
Probably when they finally add PvP templates.
---
Oh, and they should also phase Agony Resistance and infusions into an account-wide system.
---
Mostly streaming iirc. Also I am not surprised he's being silent with this current template drama.
---
I mostly respect the guy, but since he's got a voice in the community it's a shame he's silent about this.
---
Yet they stay to complain on Reddit to constantly complain, funny how that works.
---
Let's say you play weaver sword/dagger and your weapons are legendary and you are in dungeons/fractals and you wanna pre-cast Meteor shower with your staff, the moment you swap back to your sword/dagger you no longer have sigils and infusions on your weapons. And yes, I do hope it's a bug otherwise a lot of people will be very pissed and for a good reason.
---
At first I thought that the system was just overpriced but now I'm realizing that it's really really bad. It's been divided in 3 parts for outrageous monetization:
---
1. The "build templates" are not templates, they are "snapshots", a temporary instance of what should be a template
---
2. The "account templates" are what a template should be: saved and fixed, loadable on a need basis on a build templates
---
3. "Gear templates", that should be the most important feature, can't be saved to a fixed state and reloaded!
---
I'm sorry to say that, but that's a sad attitude. These people make a game for you to enjoy, can't you just appreciate it? I think I'll buy some extra, just to redeem a little bit of this childish behavior.
---
People like me who have, until now, enjoyed pretty much everything Anet has put out? Just because they fuck up the implementation of one new feature doesn't negate all the good that they have added to the game. They have earned every dime they have gotten from me, they just won't get another until something changes to restore my faith in them.
---
Literally unplayable
---
Oh ha ha ha ha ha, that only _makes it better._
---
Exactly.
---
I did. Build templates aren't worth using unless they also store your gear. I'm not gonna carry around gear sets in my regular inventory, lol. Now that there exists templates that store gear, I'm going to explore having multiple builds per character.
---
Yeah, I saw your other reply after posting and agree that distinction between "templates" and "loadouts" really gets at the core of most players' issues with the implementation of both build and equipment templates.
---
My wife was in a discord server chatting with the creator and it was much the same. It does sound like chairs as a whole were cannibalized from mount tech and have very specific limitations they need to work within.
---
I mean, if you'd rather make an entirely new character for specific circumstances, as well as taking all the time to either craft them new gear or swap your gear back and forth between characters, in order to save about $10, that's your call to make. Personally, I'd rather pay a bit more to be able to swap everything around in a half-dozen clicks on a single character, but different people are allowed to have different priorities.
---
That aside, I'd say that the comparison to Bag slots is actually a pretty close one: it costs the same to max them out on a character, and they both effectively add inventory space, each with their own benefits and limitations. It's a fair argument to say that both are overpriced, although I personally don't find them particularly problematic.
---
What you have just described is GW1 build templates lol.
---
Don't be retarded.
---
Yes.
---
Not like I'm ever gonna buy this ^((or anything judging what direction ANet's taking)) from gem store, but why is it ***five*** charges instead of ***six***? This doesn't make sense tbf.
---
You literally have an instant swap button keybind now.
---
(Sarcastic tone) Onooo, people have to actually remember things!
---
They aren't giving us raids, fotm or wvwvw. If they did any of that id have bought the stupid templates.
---
Hate speech in law means something. Not every insult counts as hate speech, calling a feature in a game retarded is 100% not hate speech in most countries if not all (since i dont know about all.)
---
So, go ahead educate me, which country would this be considered hate speech, lawfully, when someone calls a feature in a game retarded?
---
I can totally agree on that.
---
Hopefully not a bug
---
They _removed utility that I had in the prior setup_. 
---
#How is this fucking better?
---
You could just abuse the templates for same effect anyways
---
Holy shit, someone let the special snowflake out of their cage and they got their feelings hurt. (Don't worry, I used non-gender pronouns as you clearly get butthurt over this kind of thing)
---
Let's see here:
---
Definition of retarded
---
1: dated, now usually offensive : slow or limited in intellectual or emotional development : characterized by mental retardation
---
**2: informal, usually offensive : very stupid or foolish**
---
I'm going to go with definition #2 on this as to what they were trying to get across.
---
Don't do that either. Don't buy shit, at all, till they walk this back.
---
Wait, are those pants STAPLED TO HER LEGS??
---
It's time the game dies before NCSoft makes ANet turn it into Zynga v2.0.
---
I would buy slots  IF! they are acc bound.
---
Yes i said that i would buy them but this is stupid.
---
I sort of wonder if they misnamed it specifically so they could shut down arctemplates with less conversation. Also marketing.
---
I'm aware :).
---
Except it would be along-side the current server side storage they have now, so you'd still have the advantages of being able to use your most common builds on a different client and have your stored builds exposed through the API.
---
If you put it that way might as well make templates 5k gems each
---
I wouldn't know if you keep saying that it's better than nothing. The one comment of you I answered says the opposite: that you regret the update.
---
But yeah, update is amazing for the overwhelming majority of people. But fucks the power user minority *hardcore*.
---
I think it's also the way to import builds? I haven't played with it extensively, other than trying to figure out where my Wvw spec went. I think you have to add chat link to storage? 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, of course.
---
It's ok one day you'll get a job and will actually earn your own money instead of scrounging on your mum's benefits.
---
Now shoo child
---
(shrug) Sucks bro.
---
-uninstalls-
---
It's practically the only way to not completely devalue legendary armor. These build templates are far more versatile than legendary armor ever was. If legendary armor could be shared cross character, you suddenly have an incentive to build it again.
---
code doesnt work in chat
---
Not only don’t buy character slots; don’t buy *anything.* I’m at work so I have yet to look things over and work myself into any sort of rage, but just spending the same amount of money on something else that puts money in their pocket is not voting with your wallet. To add another option for those who want to spend elsewhere: Go buy a steam card and buy indie games. As with market basket, Tweet your receipts @Guildwars2, share with friends and make sure word gets around.
---
I'd be more likely to use the template storage if you got a pair per mode.
---
The words literally irrelevant as anything BUT hate speech. The fuck are you talking about? 
---
It’s only use was in the medical field/educational field which was replaced at least 12 years ago with ID. 
---
Stop being a jackass. Not using a word isn’t going to hurt you. Like at all. It’s not that hard it just takes time to unlearn it.
---
It's not really removed. It's there. It's just changed from being automatic to pressing a button. Unless you're talking about a WvW separate template instead, but that's NOT what I'm talking about.
---
the complete and utter deletion of QoL seems pretty bad.
---
I was expecting actual templates. Not saveable builds. You modify your template every time you swap something rather than it being something you can easily load back in and be at your same starting point.
---
RNG, you don't get to participate in that event.
---
I mean, why did they bothered to raise the drop rates and mention it in the patch note if it was to remain *that rare* anyway. It's not like there was a significant increase of availability on the TP since.
---
They make a game to make money. If you think otherwise your seriously wrong.
---
Saw a typo on a skill one time, it's all I could see! I could not concentrate on the game. IT'S SPELLED THE NOT TEH!
---
That was the real intended price they actually listen to our feedback Kappa
---
Wait, commander, what's that coming out of the maguuma jungle, is that what i think it is, holy cow 100 jungle strippers clad head to toe in leather and feather, 100 jungle strippers charging their way down to lions arch for a primal party. Get ready commander, we are about to face our greatest challenge yet
---
And look at the bltc....
---
With the new template system how to you export your build to share outside of the game?  I was able to make a link in game, but I don't know how to share it outside of gw2.
---
Give Anet more money for this abortion of a system, no thanks.
---
&gt; Only, these build templates were limited to ONE per gamemode
---
Actually, PvP had build templates for years now (3 default builds, one per elite spec + the core). Real templates, just couldn't edit them. 
---
I don't understand why they didn't just expand on that instead of making this loadout bs we have now.
---
If you want to go back to 2017... we can start listing patch for patch what each game has received. I never said this game gets NOTHING but the patches are coming to a slow crawl. My timeframe was a response to the poster that replied to me.
---
He said the other game has content being drip fed but they had an expansion release in July and then 4-5 months later another content patch. I asked in that same time frame what has GW2 had, that was all.
---
Yeah this was pointed out in 1 thread after the stream but no-one took any notice of it. The system is just shit.
---
&gt;Games loot system is broken
---
I demand, no, *deserve* every piece of loot in this game, without putting in *any* effort.
---
I'm getting constant DCs too in LA and other open world (on EU). When tried to restart the game, now GW2 doesn't even accept my password any more in the login window, even though it's the correct one.
---
Edit: now it shows the "can't connect to the login server" message instead.
---
I'm having the same issues. Can't even login on the launcher now. :(
---
Because they're mostly just convenient loadout slots. You can load any build from storage into a "loadout" slot and can easily overwrite each one of the loadouts with a different build from build storage. In my ideal implementation of this:
---
Build storage would be unlimited and free.
---
Character specific build templates would be 150 gems each or 300 for a pack of 3 and would be account unlocks (once you pay for a template slot that slot is available on all characters).
---
Equipment templates would be 250 gems each or 600 for a pack of 3 (these include item storage after all) and would be account wide unlocks as well. I also think we should have been given 3 of these to start, not 2.
---
Same, can't login in to the game. Got scared there for a second thinking theres an issue on my end
---
They're loadouts, to use a more ubiquitous game term.
---
Well, they aren't bound to the gamemodes anymore, that's positive I think. 
---
If you have a WvW/PvE only char, you can use all builds now and not only one. So in best case you get more builds for your char. In worst case it's the same as before.
---
This bug has been in the game for a loooong time, I use it to quickly copy dyes to new amror sets.
---
Now it's going to get fixed, RIP
---
You can copy/paste the chat code for builds into a notepad or similar, and just save them all there. If you right click on the build tab in the (H) panel you can click copy build template and then paste it wherever.
---
Well people WANT them to release another expansion and would happily pay for it, but they decided to stick to the free living world releases.  While admirable that they release it for free, it's just not very fun or engaging for a lot of people, and they'd rather have expansion-level features that they are willing to pay for.
---
I'm not sure if you're arguing or agreeing with me
---
It's disgusting when gw1 had this for free no questions asked. A 'qol' like this in a franchise notorious for being build wars is fucking ridiculous and greedy to charge for.
---
It's not even designed properly at all. They can't even copy paste a 15 year old feature. All that shit is Supposed to come in an expansion, and for b2p you charge for skins and such not major features.
---
SO they REMOVED some utility that was there before. Now I have to take extra actions which I did NOT have to do before. Do you understand what removing something means? Maybe get a dictionary somewhere.
---
It's silly how people are trying to defend this bullshit.
---
also enabled the 3 by default when you entered wvw and vice versa? or you need to switch by hand?
---
Same here in France
---
And lets also not forget the accompanied "this is worse than a training run" comment alongside it
---
Gw1 was funded on yearly expansions, gw2 is funded on skins and QOL features
---
&gt; Get fucked if you play all three gamemodes
---
Or more than one character. Before the patch I thought they were gonna add 3 build slots per character but nope, it's per account.
---
So while before every single character had a PvP, a WvW, and a PvE build that was automatically changed, now with only 3 free slots for the entire account people can only replicate this on A SINGLE character before running out of slots. Rest of their characters straight up lost something major and it costs $$ to get a worse version of it back.
---
Code 42 - could be a massive DDOS... Which could be some pitchfork backlash.. only saying.
---
You didn't call me anything. That was a previous poster. I was more commenting on how you got so bent out of shape over an insult then proceeded to insult them yourself with what I would consider a much more derogatory term.
---
Yeah I think if they let the templates be different in different games modes, I'd find it much more useful...
---
No that's not what I'm saying you dolt. I want to work for it. I want to put effort in for it... Not play the lottery. Jesus Christ be less dense please
---
WAIT the template slots are per character???
---
and right now, it doesn't even work right.
---
I'm assuming this wasn't intended functionality - but I went to PVP today and the game overwrote my PvE build template to the PVP one. Didn't go back when I left the lobby, either.
---
Title isn't clear, so that's understandable.

&gt; They have more then enough money
---
I'm not Anet apologist and they seem to be getting more and more wrong these days.  But this is a MAJOR assumption you're making and I'm not sure what it's based on.  Enough money for what?  To pay their employees?  For their parent company to consider them worth keeping around at all anymore?  What are you basing this assumption on?
---
Expansions are expensive and infinitely less flexible than living world releases. Since Anet has been going through roughness it would probably be a death sentence if they tried to stay the course with expansions.

I can remember this rule all the way back to DAOC.

Oh I'm a very empathetic person. What I'm not is someone who is so concerned about another person's use of language that I need to go all white-knight SJW on them.

We can see when you make edits. When a comment has a little asterisk above it, that means its edited. When it doesn't, that means its not. His comment has no asterisk, yours does.
---
It's just some post on Reddit dude. 
---
It's only purpose was to show the difference in features, that's all.
---
You're the one projecting your ruleset on some Reddit post somebody made. Not only that, but your inferring OP's intent based of the standards you yourself created. When, if you go look at some other comments by OP you'll see that they're in fact in agreement, ANet bad, ANet build templates bad, arcdps good.
---
Instead of criticizing, why not add to the post and create your own feature list that incorporates what you find important? 
---
Or, do what the majority of other readers are, and read this as a feature comparison, with an innate understanding that not all features are equal. An understanding a monkey could get, such that I don't really see why you think it's so important to overstate in OP's scrapped together excel sheet. Sure, if this was a professional corporate feature list, it could be argued as misguided with the intent to decieve, but again it's just some rando reddit post.
---
You realize that when you call people “dumb cunts”, you’ve lost every ounce of your credibility on the subject and become a hypocrite, right?
---
I had this bug from a long time ago when I swap armors. The only way I found to fix it, is after you already equipped new armor, make sure you visit the dye window and then toggle back to equipment window and it will "refresh" the dye channels appropriately, or at least that's how it works for me.  
---
My bad, I have not tested this with slot 1/2, I was just thinking of how I treated it in the older system. Will test once I'm able to get back into the game since the login servers are down.
---
Try the portals
---
Well that makes no sense because even if you do load a build at level 1 traits are still locked till you reach the the level required.
---
To Zadash!
---
&gt; In GW1, as many of you know, you could load a template and tweak it if needbe for whatever you were doing.
---
&gt; That's not what we have now. 
---
We do: [Here you go.](https://imgur.com/0yAHLLT)
---
Well, we *also* have 3-6 *live*-builds and 2-6 *live*-equipments now, what we never had in GW1, that's right. Also keep in mind, equipment builds in GW1 were PvP only.
---
Red shirt guy that you?
---
Fine. I've had it. Same dumb shit from you every time. Good thing one can block on reddit.
---
thank god i figured it out before i went fractals, so i just had the template tab 1 full of gear and the others empty... then it works like it used to do
---
Leave the guy alone, damn...
---
For me that's the red line. I lost complete interest. I will still play Open PvE and WvW but I don't care anymore. Not willing to spent any more money. The only reason to implement it was to monetize it.
---
yup..my dyes are a mess, and wont save as anything decent right now 😂
---
&gt; Respect has to be EARNED.
---
Like... I don’t even disagree with this. I’m just saying that it’s not the greatest word to use.

&gt; They acknowledge that they happened, and try to move on towards the future.

It would be easier to move forward if people stopped using language that could be used to hurt minorities, but okay.

But it's easy to ACTIVate your builds! A complete new vISION on the way you play the game! It's per character, it's not free. The amount you ask? Only three. Let's get the facts and let's be real. ANET fucked us up, as they do, no big deal.

I tried WvW and I entered with my PvE build. I had to manually switch it. It seems the WvW build is stored in slot 3 by default. When I went back to LA, my WvW build was still loaded in so I had to switch again back to PvE.
---
The cupcakes aren't for you, they are for Anet...
---
I agree, however usually rev are supposed to deal with anomalies in 100CM. But of course, it's indeed a very good healing build.
---
yes?
---
If you can't answer the question, because you know the answer is "there is not any", you might at least want to shut up and move on.
---
It is **literally** not hate speech, go ask your local lawyer then come back to me. Just because you use any label you want doesn't make it the right one.
---
Nope, this is how they work and we have been asking why since the preview.

---
I've just spend over $200 to get a build system that is only half as functional as GW1's free one. Totally worth it.
---
Aka, it is not hate speech.
---
Thanks, i guess at least one of got educated today. You are welcome.

I think it's because it's one of the "standard packs" you can buy. You can buy transmute charges (and other stuff) seperated or in a pack of 5, 10 or 25.

I think they just took the pack of five, instead of making a "new" pack with 6 charges.

---
thats because we didnt get gear templates at all, we got loadout slots.
---
That'd be somewhat nice tbh. As a daily fractal CMs &amp; T4s clearer, I love to precast my skills like meteor shower, or stacking might before a fight. But as an ele I need to swap weapons. Now with build templates it's just impossible because my weapons are in that "alternate" inventory and there's no way I can equip them without having them losing all the sigils and infusions.
---
I have every right to complain. And I’m doing so in a constructive way. I’m not swearing and hurling insults. I bought the base game, because it wasn’t free at launch, the deluxe edition of both expansions, and many, many items on the gem store. I have no complaints with spending money to support live service games. That does not mean they can monetize every aspect of the game under the defense of, “Free game, stop complaining.”
---
Less of a problem for people who dont pvp or wvw.
---
Even less of a problem for people who gave up on GW2 after POF
---
Thats why i Said "even easier" Not "than possible" BC yes Most dont, 
---
even without Templates 
---
Tbh idc i was Just pointing Out the Most Common reason for OPs stance 
---
I think if ppl dont want to learn they propably wont and IT would need much more force to make them
---
I do all 3 game modes daily, shortly after reset.  
---
Most days, I switch it up from the character I played the previous day, i just choose who I'm in the mood to play from over 30 level 80s on my account.  
---
I also share weapons and armor across most of these characters.  
---
This sounds like it made my life very difficult. Really, I don't see anything positive here at all.
---
Doesn't /stuck works in this case?
---
I'd be asking for some lube instead.
---
I would be “almost” happy if I could have 3-4 gear templates per character.  Not very many of my characters use only 2.
---
That's how it works. These are loadouts, not templates, unfortunately. Naming them loadouts was a bit misleading, but everyone has been clamoring specifically for templates, so I see why they called it that.
---
you cant use commands like these while in combat in pvp
---
&gt;this system is great for those who have no need of it
---
I agree with this.
---
The only thing I don't like about your statement is your assumption that people who play a lot of game modes are more dedicated.
---
I've known a lot of players who only play a single game mode, be it WvWvW, PvP, or PvE (or even just fractals or just raids, etc.) and they all seemed dedicated to the game and the niche they preferred to play in.
---
The portion of the playerbase that plays all three modes is essentially nonexistent. The portion that plays two modes is substantial, but the portion that plays a single mode is the vast majority of the players. Most people don't raid. Most people don't play WvW. Most people log in, do what they find enjoyable, and that's it. By giving them three free templates, where they can store full sets of gear without taking up inventory space, you grant them a huge amount of convenience, which encourages them to consider buying more slots. If it benefits the vast majority, then pissing off the minority is a worthwhile sacrifice, especially when you consider that the vocal minority is split between people who already aren't playing or giving them money, and people who will keep giving them money anyway.
---
So I know most of the comments are going to be about the build templates, but, is it just me or is there a blank achievement banner thing between "Shadow of a Mad King" and "Extra Life"?
---
The extra pack of three for Build Storage is free for one month.
---
If you're unable to play for a month and miss out, don't feel too bad, the Build Storage is the same thing you can easily replicate with the Alt and Tab keys on your keyboard and the Notepad program.  It's not as useful as actual Build Template slots and Equipment Templates slots are.
---
Yes but its amusing to stand there alive and kicking while joko laments your deaths
---
Yes, pretty much that was my conclusion, while multiple legendary weapons can use the same sigils/infusions the moment you remove any of the weapons from your gear templates the weapon loses everything it shares sigils/infusion, I haven't tried it yet but I guess the same thing happens with legendary armor. Shame because I only have 2 legendary sigils on my weaver and I was very happy when I saw I can share them with scepter/warhorn for my tempest which would have meant I no longer have to use all the slaying sigils for scepter/warhorn anymore.
---
I keep reading it as "sep-tic" and it just makes me think about diseases.
---
&gt; This is a QoL regression, working against a 7 year old habit can be hard.
---
Were you addicted to it? Because I find it that hard... and I'm known for having a hard time remembering things lately.
---
I have a request can we get the helm by itself??
---
It looks so nice.
---
Could you elaborate? What is negative and how?
---
It's silly how aggressive all of you guys are when someone has a different point of view.
---
Yeah this is pretty bad. I'm surprised how bad templates are landing for me personally considering how big of an improvement they should have been.
---
I play WvW, sPvP and PvE. Before the system launched my WvW build and my PvP build were stored, now they are taking up space in my templates, so I thought going into today's patch I was going to get two new build templates, but I'm actually getting none. I still want to WvW and PvP so I need to spend money to begin using the template swapping feature, or use a work around like a text file or a guild bank.
---
I imagined I'd walk into the new system happily swapping from raid druid, open world power soulbeast to fractal soulbeast easily and conveniently, but now I can't do any of that without fucking up my PvP or WvW builds.
---
None of this would matter as much to me if build templates were account wide, but they are character specific so I'm not going to drop thousands of gems into specific characters I may not even be playing later, it feels horrible.
---
Build templates feel horrible when they should have been amazing. The way they've done it looks like poor planning and I can't answer the question "who was this designed for" because it just doesn't make sense.
---
These motherfuckers are nickle and diming us all. I've spent enough money. I'm done.
---
I don't love the pricing by any means, but I really don't see many people needing all six gear templates on all 9 professions. I can see wanting four to six templates on one or two, and maybe a third on a few others, but the cost of fully maxing out 9 characters with six entire sets of gear each is an unreasonable yardstick.
---
Build templates, sure, some people want 50 or whatever, but the people who micro-optimize like this need more templates than the maximum anyway, and will need to manage them on their own regardless of how much they might otherwise need to pay.
---
well legendary armor is probably same but doesn't matter that much since you basically never swap an armor on the fly
---
I love this suggestion! My point in adding in ice cream to my list was for people who may not want to put money towards another mmo, but supporting  Indie games through something like this will give them exposure they might not have had otherwise. And who knows? You may have a blast!
---
inspect eve online, this game has a perfect fit template manager that can be used both free and paid users can freely use.
---
There's been a (quite recent) influx of insanely overpriced monetization now on console, PC games that only used to exist on mobile trash. (Paying 100 dollars to get a waifu skin or whatever).
---
Now we have ubisoft games where you have your XP rates gutted, no weapon skins, etc to unlock in game, and then you have """Timesavers""" added to the store to help you level in a hamstringed system. 
---
And then you have Besthesda with the audacity to try and charge people 11.99 a month for a subscription service for one game, when you have other sub services like Games Pass for PC for far less giving you a ton of games like the new Outer Worlds. 
---
And now we have build templates costing an insane amount whereas the other convenience items (bag slots/shared slots, etc) cost faaaar less in comparison. Anet is trying to test the waters, please don't let them.
---
Right, just those. The account wide build storage having a charge and a limit of 24 is just bad.
---
but...but...they worked hard and long for this great feature...
---
honestly tho...didnt they say they planned for 1 year or am i wrong here?
---
How can this "feature" come out of a 1 year planning-phase?
---
No, I didn't misunderstood you. Your text was probably intentionally vague, especially due to the context given from "vote with your wallet". It would't make a difference if you'd wrote "bought" or "gotten". In this context it's more or less the same and does not give one the impression you traded gems for gold. A better version would've been "Vote with your wallets", "I will do so, which is why I traded gold for gems".
---
I hope that was sarcasm.
---
Did GW1 have gear templates? Also what is 1/2 of unlimited?
---
It's not a matter of me being aggressive, and its not a matter of there being a different point of view. They simply removed something which we had before. How is it even possible to have a different point of view about that? It's just simply something that they did.
---
Awesome!
---
Looks like someone accidentally sneezed while typing the prize.
---
also hallo weiterer deutsche/r Spieler/in :D
---
They are called "templates" out of custom and because everyone has been, but they are actually "loadouts".
---
* "Template": Blueprint without specifics that you can try to load even if you do not have all the pieces.
---
* "Loadout": Specific equipment and skills.
---
So any change you do to them is saved, and there aren't actually templates other than the "template storage" that is shared for the whole account, can only store up to 24 templates server-side instead in your disk, and only stores skills and traits.
---
No you're not missing anything. You know the correct definition of the word "template" while Anet apparently does not.
---
&gt; I would have been really surprised if they were completely free as it would be stupid loss of revenue.
---
Clearly never played GW1, this shit that is 7 years late was included with the base game.
---
It's possible anywhere. The two keys are not staying in one play, kill the stuff with high bonus and move on, and stack as many buffs as you possibly can.
---
In the early days of HOT, people leveled by killing the veteran spiders above Jaka Itzel in VB with stacked buffs, over and over again. They didn't get the bonus, but they were vets, so it was still fast. Grinding that and one area of the CoF dungeon were how people were grinding out their masteries.
---
uh. agreeing. I think I had the same confusion over your reply to blackbird...
---
Please just share how to do that, I don't care about risking to be banned.
---
Sadly, half of my raid squad is currently upset they cant buy more on tp coz tp doesnt work. So quite honestly just F it. Like in rl who we vote for, we deserve it .
---
Stop giving ANet money until they stop shitting the bed.
---
Trophies for items, skills and effects specific to an area can't be used outside that area, unless you have the item in your inventory.
---
To get the icon you can go to Ulta in brisban and use one of the rocks. They can still be used after completing the heart.
---
Your brain is so smooth I can see my reflection. 
---
There's a difference between naughty words and hate speech.
---
Okay
---
you dont have over 200 employers if you dont have any money
---
This needs a bump
---
Yeah, I don't get why people feed into the confirmation bias that support for GW2 is 'good' in any sense.
---
The game's loaded with thousands upon thousands of items, and no real clear convention as to their acquisition or value.  All of which have the chance to bug-out.
---
Most of the support staff barely plays the game, despite getting a monthly stipend of gems.  The people who get help from a CS member that gives a damn are the lucky ones.
---
I "invested" some real life money into gems to get the awesome hat I later found I could have bought it with one or the other in-game currency.
---
But the damn hat makes me so, so happy. Totally worth the "investment".... I mean, it's not like it'll help me get more Real-life money or even in-game money, but it still makes me happy. Especially on my fierce Charr-dude. He loves his dainty little hat, and I'm convinced he likes to stroke its plume in between obliterating foes.
---
Buying pixels can bring this kind of silly happiness in a game, but an "investment" it is not.
---
As has been explained to you ad nauseum by other users, the word “retarded” is not hate speech. I’m just going to assume that your inability to grasp that fact is due to you being, well, retarded.
---
The only add-ons that need windowed full-screen are non-hooked overlays, like GW2TaCo. You can totally use ArcDPS, D912pxy, and Radial Mounts in full-screen.
---
Or on the other hand, in order to maintain 200 employees, you need a lot of money.  I'm just wondering where you got the idea that they have "more than enough".  Because Anet is a private company and without looking at their balance sheet, the best we can do is speculate.
---
The icon and the item have never changed.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Tuning_Crystal.png
---
You may be mixing it up with other item that also shares the icon, like this one:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Energy_Crystal
---
It's more about the fact that it was a small thing that was working well. When a really BIG thing is changed from automatic to manual, you'll know because it's in your face. The automatic switch was a small, background thing that was really discreet. Now that it's gone, I'm sure lots of people won't notice, and will suffer from not noticing. At least in the first few days/weeks.
---
No shit lol.
---
If by "local lawyer" you mean the United States, then they won't tell you anything because there aren't laws against hate speech in America. Just inciting Violence. So saying the "legal term" is laughable when no one here is telling you what you're doing is illegal, just that you're being a jackass for no reason. 
---
That being said, the general definition I gave to you above is what is generally used, though some places have "hate speech" laws that are more laws against "inciting violence" not actual hate speech (such as the United States). There are still plenty of countries, such as Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, etc. do have laws involving Hate Speech that isn't about inciting violence/hatred but defamation/denigration/etc.
---
Definitely agreed with black Bird, I just think we need the right focus.  Complaining that it's not living up to something it's not intended to be (i.e. isn't adding mor spaces) is less useful criticism than stating criticisms of how it's failing at what it's designed to achieve (i.e. fails to be a QOL upgrade)
---
The problem with legendary armor that irks me the most is that  templates are priced so poorly that it's far more efficient to buy another character slot than to unlock more template tabs, which really hurts legendary armor users since you cannot use the same gear on two characters.
---
Same, lmao. Played multiple bosses b4 noticing they were blank
---
GW1 Style &lt;3
---
Do you think it’s a bit odd that you need a third party program to manage your official templates because the implementation is so limited?
---
But I want to raid, too
---
Hey, we get 2100 gems worth of template things for a mere 2000 gems, we should be sooo happy!
---
^((/s))
---
I'm using this. It's very nicely done
---
Honestly, if you T4 fractal just about everyday you will have 2 sets of gear from chest drops. Hell, I'm on 3 sets and I do little to no crafting unless I really want to gear a toon up and I'm missing a piece. Its all about a quick daily runs after rest. If you can do that and remember to craft the time gated mats you can gear fairly quick.
---
Yes
---
Well he did vote with his wallet, as in he didn't spend a cent on them but got them anyway.
---
arc good, i miss arc
---
That's how all monetised "convenience features" work; create an inconvenience and sell the solution to it.
---
Por que no los dos
---
Should be a feature of lege armor, but cant give out stuff for free, even if it does encourage using a massive gold sink in the economy.
---
The problem with that statement is there's no way its mutually exclusive.
---
this is so annoying, and i share my legendary trinkets between 3 chars which i play the most on since aurora came out, this is so much hassle now
---
The free slots really aren't more than enough. They're more than enough if you only play 1 or 2 characters, but most people at this point probably have every profession at 80, and they only give us 6 account-wide templates.
---
That means it's only enough for at most 3 professions on your account, which is 1/3 of the total.
---
Wow, I can't wait for the moment when this fucks me over in the future.
---
The equipment loadouts are also flawed, take a look at the following scenario:
---
I have 2 low toughness chrono templates, 1k and 1271 (to top condi weaver), both using the same off-hand sword and focus (not at the same time obv). Now the issue is that if both loadouts are currently using the same weapon, the other one will be in my inventory. However if one is using the sword and the other one the focus, I will only be able to swap via the hero pannel. This is just inconsistent, requires more clicks and I personally like to know where my items are, rather than having to deal with an auto sorting system. Not to forget duplicate skins slow this down even more.
---
Also, Requires you to fiddle with your game DLL files and just trust the DLLs you downloaded are fine:  Yes / No
---
&gt; and HoT had 4 maps
---
VB, AB, TD and DS
---
&gt; speech that is intended to insult, offend, or intimidate a person 
---
And what part of OP's post was **intended** to insult, offend, or intimidate a **person**?
---
Outer Worlds is worth a look as well.
---
I don't have any full ascended but still one or the other item and also a legendary. You don't need to have full sets - it would already be helpful to swap these few items around.
---
And you can still save template codes to an external database
---
Likewise. Except I have light legendary armor that I swap between the light armor classes, and I learned that that has now become much more of an inconvenience before. I'd have been better of just making 5 sets of ascended armor for the same price.
---
I am able to do it freely out of combat in an Enemy BL in territory not owned by my Link.
---
Price should be red, not yellow!
---
Your comment is basically just Reddit bingo. Have you ever had an independent thought in your life?
---
I'm fine with builds and gear templates. What I'm not fine with is that storage isn't free. At the very least that part of the system should be free.
---
What a great community Anet have fostered!
---
:)
---
Buy all the tabs?
---
Archage unchained. Buy to play. No pay to win.
---
What is your character wearing on the left? It looks like she has vitiligo and star tatoos on her limbs - took me a while to realize what exacly I was seeing
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I paid for the main game, I paid for the first expansion, I paid for the second expansion, I paid for gem cards, and I paid for direct gems ingame. I guess I fucking paid enough to not be left with inconvenient stuff.
---
So here I thought and hoped "No big deal, maybe it's limited so much but just in a single game mode." But then this happens.  They've gone and done it and replaced my wvw and pve builds and merged them together into one build slot.  I effectively have less builds now if I want to play more than one game mode.
---
I've been gone for a few years but still peak at the new stuff every once in a while. Has it really gotten so bad? Last I played you just saw "T4 daily" and joined and that was that, for the most part.
---
My only raiding experience was with friends who'd ask me to fill roles when one of the main group were filled because I was reliable as a backup. Miss playing with those guys :)
---
Pssst. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/White_Mantle_Portal_Device
---
The big problem with character based is, what if you dont want that char anymore, do you lose them upgrades, ive never deleted a char with upgrades on it, 
---
But as its been seen time and time again with Anet, they can easily remove a class from content in a single balance patch, if you invest in a char and Anet decide no more game modes for you and nerf it to dirt, your stuck with a class that has upgrades that no team will take, 
---
I dont know why 7 years after launch Anet still put stuff into the game that is char based upgrades, all upgrades should be account bound, its just greed that makes them use char based upgrades,
---
Alas though, just do what so many others are doing, and do not buy the upgrades, its the only way to get the message across.
---
GW2 has an issue with overpriced "micro"transactions anyway, but the system is separated and clunkier than the original implementation in GW and the fan implementation in arcDPS. 
---
I can't obviously say for sure that it was designed this way so as to monetize the same feature three times but it sure feels like it.
---
I'm a casual and don't need more than two slots on each character so I don't really have enough skin in the game to riot too much.
---
Not really, not all features on that list are of equal importance.
---
I raid and mainly play PvE. Build templates are only a positive for me
---
I kinda want this to catch on
---
...yes? The only time the equipment of a particular build of mine changes is on major balance updates
---
So legendary items are actually less QoL than ascended, nice.
---
How do you F? there's no function row on those.
---
Agreed, I was fully willing to play for acc wide unlocks. But I refuse to pay for this shit...
---
i have this feeling,how they always making some sexy outfit and in the last moment someone comes in and hes like 
---
 "NOOOOOOOOO WTF YOU DOING,PUT SOME RANDOM SHIT ON IT TO COVER IT UP!"
---
I mean, it doesn't have to be one or the other. I didn't use arcdps because of its drawbacks (I did for a while actually, but it was too fiddly for my liking), and I won't use the new templates because of its bigger drawbacks.
---
The build that I've been using for pvp sense Pof...i don't remember how to put it back together...
---
Jokes on you, I always rage quit when I fail at solitaire...
---
I enjoy casual gameplay as well open world, story RPGs. 
---
Yet GW2 is a bit meh for me ATM, there are better casual, single player and story driven games out there.
---
Some might have. I never did.
---
My laziness has paid off.
---
You dont need to agree on a fact. Theres no opinion on facts.
---
After playing with it for a few mins, you can get 3 builds per game mode if you use the build storage lots in conjunction with templates. My only issue is with only have 2 equipment slots and the limited number of build storage lots. there is no way to really use this system out buying more build storage lots cause 3 (+3 free) just isn't enough for my 9 toons. That means I would have to buy 3500 gems to make 2 complete templates per toon per game mode. And with out the free BSL today that comes out to 4000 gems or $50 USD. :/ Now if it were unlimited BSL even with the 3  build template slots and 2 equipment slots, I wouldn't lose any sleep over pay that but it's not.
---
this is fucking hilarious. sorry op. what a fucking shit system anet made here.
---
&gt; I mean, if you aren't able to burst six even after waiting for block - your group is a complete trash and you should start asking yourself why are you there.
---
What a load of horseshit. We're talking random groups here; sometimes you'll get one that can burst every boss, sometimes you get one that needs 2 tries, sometimes you get one that has to actually do (*gasp*) the mechanics of the fight as intended. Continously trying to burst a boss when the group isn't up for it or ragequitting after a single failed attempt to do so is not a time-saving mechanic, it's being unwilling to work with the rest of the group in a group-oriented game-mode.
---
And *that's* the sign that someone is complete trash and should ask themselves if they should maybe stick to singleplayer content.
---
I rather play fractals with 4 people who know fuck-all about the mechanics, but are willing to try and learn than even 1 guy who belittles the rest of the party with childish and unneeded elitism.
---
Individually, yes.  You can't bind your gear + traits into one keybind so it's clunky.
---
Imagine standing on stage in a theater you booked prior to PAX and bragging about "free quality of life updates" immediately before selling an overpriced quality of life feature on the gem store that makes the game less convenient than it was before unless you spend potentially hundreds of dollars.
---
Imagine being this dumb
---
Twitter says I'm "saving clicks", but now when I enter wvw I have to select my build each time...
---
Its pretty good if you have different toons for different jobs. I usually do everything on one. Its a nightmare now.
---
Do the arcdps build templates still work?
---
Yikes
---
They. Aren't. Free. Peter was robbed to pay Paul.
---
Path of Exile
---
All things considered, no official support isn't really a negative in my book.
---
Running QA on this would require anet to know what the fuck a good build is, which we know damn well they don't based on balance notes
---
Haha, that is properly true :) - but it will end up being 600 gems at least
---
While still making the gameplay experience overall worse, even with the "solution", if the devs have to purposely implement those inconveniences instead of focusing on a quality game.
---
Runescape, tons of things to do. 27 skills to level up, task system, quest, pvm, etc.
---
Been playing for 5.5 years, never needed more inventory than what I have by default, ascended gear is piss easy to earn if you play the game, and imagine thinking that the hour or two you'd spend clearing dead content is worth paying an extra 1200 gems lul.
---
It depends on the mechanics.
---
If you have, for example, 2 platforms far away from each other you need players to stand on at the same time, or 2 bosses that need to be kept apart or they heal each other, or any other type of mechanic that requires multiple people, you can't solo the instance, no matter how outlevel or outgeared you are.
---
There are mechanics like that in some games I've played, while in WoW they do change those when the instances are no longer current to make them soloable, other games don't.
---
If you want an MMO, the most popular alternative is FFXIV, but it is a literal chore to play with combat nothing like GW2. The game is, like WoW, centered around auto attacking and having abilities on global cooldowns. The GCD in FFXIV is especially egregious. 
---
Other than that, there isn't much in the way of fantasy MMOs with enough of a community and of high enough quality to really recommend.
---
Even if you would buy more templates, this system only allows you to buy 4 more builds, which is even worse
---
Archage omegalul
---
They literally just released their Neir raid, which came x3 faster than it takes Anet to do even one
---
The new Unchained servers are better than Gw2, whats the problem?
---
Switching between builds is the whole point of having templates and it's obviously an upgrade. For example, now I can switch between a roaming dragonhunter build when solo and a support firebrand when I join a group in wvw. Of all the complaints, this is one of the dumbest.
---
as usual people overestimating income from subscription fees when just a quick google search proves otherwise...
---
Price changes happen, as do sales. *If* they change prices, it'll probably be down the line once the majority of the people who would buy them (at least at the current price) already have, and they'll probably give refunds to the few who buy them right before the change or sale, like they already do for other things.
---
When they were rolling this stuff out, from what they said about equipment being stored this is what I initially thought, that there was a limited slot box that you can throw your shit into that other characters on the account can pull from for their templates. Instead we got the option to pretty much accidentally softlock certain gear to a character, and if you wanted to delete a character to remake it and forgot to purge their builds of any gear, well there goes all your shit.
---
For someone not in the know, what does this help with?
---
Yes, but most companies do so sooner or later :-/
---
Meanwhile Anets templates delete infusions.
---
Monster Hunter World and ESO are my go to. What don't you like about ESO?
---
There is nothing amazing out there, thats why people keep coming back to Gw2 after all these years. Its probably a significant factor to why the game is still as 'semi-popular' as it is, as nothing of quality from other companies has been produced to make Anet lose their customers.
---
It's not truly F2P though.  It's literally B2P with a free core game.  Come on
---
This is exactly the problem. They bundled two features, which should have been separate, into one, and charge a full price for that. And if you use legendary gear, you make zero use of the "storage" part, yet pay the full price for it. Same goes for people who maxed out bag slots to store all the gear.
---
It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive for it to be true.
---
have fun being a dps monkey forever I guess.
---
great that it's working out for you then. The wankers have a different use case
---
Sadly because they said that pvp gets their separate """"templates"""" it means they gave you 2 slots because pve and wvw, and then traits for pve,pvp,wvw. You aren't getting ANY slot for free. You have the same as before.
---
the stat and rune swap on it works... as long as you dont want to change anything manually it is fine
---
You are a clown
---
Do you get paid to be an Anet apologist or is it just fanaticism?
---
Or kill them from up top... that's what I do
---
wait, so there really is no way to have equipment templates saved to builds?  I've been looking everywhere for something I thought would be an obvious inclusion lol, what a disappointment
---
I consider any game that actually creates regular content for its playerbase and gamemodes leagues better than Anet and Gw2. The fact that sPvP, WvW and PvE is in its state its fucking disgusting. Id would genually like you to tell me of any other game that updates its game modes 1-2 times a year and tell me why you think its better than anything on that list.
---
This. I get that from the outside perspective it's comes off as rude, pretentious, unrealistic, etc, but sometimes you just aren't in the mood when you see what you're working it.
---
I play single player games and Dota 2. Recently replaying Witcher 3 with Witcher 3 enhanced edition mod and a few others
---
Congrats on making a weakling butthurt! 
---
But your original post is on point. If they have not hinted at Post LS5 Xpac or more LS by now, this is the last chapter. 
---
Then GW3 - Lootbox Edition!
---
this is actually making my pj to crash xD, i have two legendary that i very different situations but have the same sigils and infusions, so i put them in diferent equipament slots, for some reason some times i think i confuses the sigils and infusions of one weapon with another and when i try to change builds it crashes to character scren, i dont know how exacly explain it, but i think that is what is happening, for the rest im like the templates, but the fact that everytime you change a legendary take out sigils and infusions is very anoying
---
I misread that as Primal Ogden Outfit and got very confused by that picture trying to imagine how Ogden would look wearing that
---
nah doge, i'm E-YELLING with my logitech
---
I mean, Bench of the Final Judge is easily an ideal sized chair for charr (I'd say same for Desert King's Throne but I could see that being an issue for bulkier charr unlike mine), and they work with other races perfectly fine. Including asura.
---
And if you look at [the original gemstore banner](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/archive/9/97/20191002233737%21Legionnaire%27s_Chair_banner.jpg), the posture was the same as Bench of the Final Judge. The main difference, besides posture, is the height of the **backing** of the chair, and the chair being a little wider than the final product (again, wouldn't influence asura [who sit angled on the cushion anyways](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Legionnaire%27s_Chair_asura_female.jpg); it'd influence humans and sylvari most, but [they](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Bench_of_the_Final_Judge_human_female.jpg) have [postures](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Bench_of_the_Final_Judge_norn_female.jpg) for oversized chairs too. Though admittedly, the male human/sylvari posture is [a bit off](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Bench_of_the_Final_Judge_human_male.jpg).
---
They can't win either way with you people. They wait to release until completed: you bitch. They release and say PvP templates will come in a bit: you bitch. Seriously, ANet can't win with the juvenile Reddit hivemind of negativity.
---
The GW2 subreddit mindlessly screeching after an update? How shocking
---
...because it's an insensitive, tactless response?
---
grothmar valley was introduced 6 weeks or 42 days ago. If we value the visage at 4.2k gold, it would mean that you would have earned an average of 100g per map meta, if you would have done it every day.
---
That not putting in the effort, thats demanding unreasonable rewards for an effort that an be negated by spending 5 gold for the the 4 legion keys on the tp every day.
---
SO what... 3 hr farming at most xD
---
He just responded to someone pointing it out, I'm not sure what he was supposed to say.
---
A few months ago, I went into the game for the first few days thinking I was going to hate it and that it'd never become my main game over GW2. I was thinking "The combat sucks ass I hate global cooldowns" and bitching about a lot of things.
---
Now I'm 3 months in and it's literally my favorite game I've ever played. If I could pay 3x the monthly sub right now to go back in time and tell myself to start this game up years ago, I'd do it. I had no idea that there existed an MMO with such incredibly storywriting as this one. Shadowbringers is an experience I'll never ever forget tbh.
---
For one, many completionists (including myself) would be satisfied. 
---
If they moved Koda’s Warmth away due to requests, they should move this one as well.
---
&gt;**Please do not**

What the hell is with all these posts lately, and why do none of them ever get removed?
---
Actual content
---
Maaaan I think you overpaid personally. Logitech is a good brand and all, but the caps lock thing still isn't working for you. At least its not a Razer...meh. Maybe logitech will send you a replacement caps lock? Their tech support is pretty good.
---
If you smash it in anger they probably won't though. Just sayin.
---
Dont worry u r not alone.
---
I consider any game that creates the content I play more than any other content to be the game that best fits my play style. Having played MANY other MMOs, I can safely say this one is the most enjoyable for me personally. A game can come out with infinite raids, but I don't like raiding so it wouldn't help me. I don't really love PvP in most games so games without a PvE server don't interest me either.  It's just a matter of opinion. All the wrong content in the world won't satisfy me any more than it satisfies you.
---
They're absolutely free as long as you literally just log on for 2 seconds in the MONTHS they're available.
---
That's like coming on here and crying that you had 3 months to get a car for free, and that they're horrible for actually expecting you to pay after the period where you could get it for free.
---
Basically you're a gaming Karen REEEing that you can't use your expired coupons.
---
Get out of here, Karen.
---
Nice to see some male skin. Too bad it also makes them look like they're wearing a diaper under those pants. x.x
---
Take your up doot! Best joke of the day!
---
(┛ಠ_ಠ)┛彡┻━┻
---
Thanks for posting that. I use perfect inscriptions in fractals because I’m already crit capped. Can you confirm if you to swap it on and off every time you change instances?
---
Well what content do you play in Gw2?
---
This one is actually pretty nice on a male charr ... assuming you don't mind getting your horns chopped off and you were looking for skin tight pants
---
well you can swap out and reuse anything. But say you take your pure berserker "template" and add some assasin pieces because the content you do requires more crit change, and then want to go back to your orignal berserk loadout, then you have to manually change all these pieces back, because the template saves all the stuff you edit in immediately and you can't go back to with what you started -&gt; thats not a template
