It's hard to say. Wing 1 has some of the best bosses (Sabetha is still a real treat) but has tedious pre-events. Wing 2 has two genuinely difficult and fun bosses but a boring and frustrating trash mob fight. Wing 3 has a cool theme and decent end boss but a plethora of bugs and escort. Wing 4 has some great story telling and neat designs but some trivial bosses and a cheesy, frustrating final boss. Wing 5's primary saving grace is Dhuum, because the rest of the wing is a cheesy RNG fest. Wing 6 is gorgeous and has fun fights, but has long roleplay sections between bosses. Wing 7's Adina and Sabir are excellent bosses (the former especially), but the final boss is not fun in my opinion and the wing in general is undertuned.
---
I think all things considered, wing 6 is my favorite, followed closely by wing 7 and wing 1.
---
there is other places to do that. talking about windows 10 exclusively (or any OS in general) is not under the subject of the game.

Haha, might be better to use the spoiler field instead. Not going to be much of a warning as it is. ;o)

Don't worry, you can get to complain while freeloading on everything because, oh boy, the next *free* living world prelude sure is going to bear on my wallet!
---
You know, you can skip every hero challenge in core tyria (technically in the whole game) if you play WvW.
---
Yea. I finally gave up the game a few years ago right before the big elf city update, because I got tired of all of the completion cape requirements. But I do miss the quests :(
---
 Problem is I can't go back because I always get sucked into completion mode
---
&gt; They've been doing it for years
---
Sure, they use it because it's an outstanding point.
---
But again, they didn't start it. It was the community itself and news sites who gave GW2 this "title".
---
It was recently in the Black Lion Statuette store, but now it’s gone and i’m so afraid it’s gonna be long before it comes back 😩
---
Dude, the in game community is not the online community. The Pvp community is not the open world community.  I've asked questions in most games and gotten silence or ridicule. That seldom happens in this game by comparison.  You may not believe the community is better than most multiplayer games, but I believe it is.
---
Other games with good communities I've played were Guild Wars 1 and Lotro. Wildstar was pretty good too, actually.
---
Each one sells a very rare item you need for crafting some of the new recipes in the game. As you introduce new items this can be expanded. Remember to add an option to use gold instead account currencies. I hate that shit.
---
I swear that when teams answer my initial "hello" before the match we have a 75% higher win rate than when no one says anything in return. Teams that converse, conquer.

It actually is documented on the wiki, but o the page "The Auditorium", since that's where the ambient dialogue actually happens if you check your minimap. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Auditorium

In GW1 whenever I'd cast "Fall Back!" or "Incoming!" I imagined I was flexing on the enemies.
---
Thankfully Guild Wars 2 has a pretty good guild system. You have more slots for joining guilds.
---
Also as non-tweeter and smartphone camper I notoriously get some weird errors about my acces to post being blocked because I don't have account. Then I must either keep refreshing or switch to desktop mode. Annoying.
---
I'm pretty sure that primo just make them out of magma and lava. At least before he absorbed other dragons magic. No corrupting, yet. He might be not sentient at all!
---
I imagine Primordus' fiery nature is incompatible with flesh of all kinds, so it has to rely on constructs instead. 
---
Actually, Balthazar kind of had to go a similar route: he was stuffing enthralled souls into suits of armor.
---
Haven’t played in several months and plan on logging in tonight. What class is worth investing in now? My main character is a guardian but I’d like to maybe try something different.
---
If memory serves correctly, the thing about Primordus is that he doesn't corrupt other beings to anywhere near the same degree as other Elder Dragons. I need to look it up again, but I think it was stated that he actually makes a lot of his minions.
---
Right, because the game is seriously lacking visual effects ...
---
What game mode or play style are you looking for? There really are a lot of great options for everything but it would help to narrow it down a little. Also do you have one or both expansions since that will change your options. In general though for PvE guardian (power DH, condi FB, and quickness FB) is pretty great in all high end PvE encounters and quickness FB can be power, condi, or healing. It might be best to just look up some [meta builds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) for the game mode you want and see what interests you.
---
I'm new as well and i've been pleasently surprised to see the world so alive. In my case it was a matter of good timing, FFXIV is my main game but now that i'm done progging raids and just doing weeklies I was looking for something different to keep me busy while waiting for new content. The fact that i can get gear that will never  be irrelevant and theres no sub fee means i can come and go as i please. Also, the 2 for 1 deal was  pretty sweet.
---
I wonder if classic wow's popularity brought awereness to the mmo genre again and maybe people who dont feel like commiting to a sub decided to look for an alternative.
---
I have both expansions. I’d like to start doing open world content and maybe wvw and fractals again. Not really into conquest pvp. I almost exclusively played guardian before despite having a character in each class max level, so I was thinking I’d invest in another class (maybe warrior?).
---
Full nomads firebrand is very epic.
---
Well all the maps are largely empty except outside of the meta train that runs around reset.  Also the occasional meta event sprinklered in here and there.  There is barely any LFG groups in any map, and trying to find help to do anything outside the standard farming maps is next to impossible.
---
When new maps are released, one must ensure they are there in the first 2-4 weeks otherwise attempting to obtain achievements is becomes extremely difficult.
---
To put it into perspective, the Desert borderlands map in WvW is generally not liked by the WvW population, many people avoid it including large servers.  Desert borderlands sees more player action than any PvE map and that considering the PvE population is much larger than the WvW population.
---
The game is amazing, that much is true.  For new players and those who’ve basically started in the past 3 years, the game will have oodles of things for these people to do.  Looking at the overall snapshot of what’s happening though, shows the game is not doing well in the direction it’s going
---
Well I can't say it's not bugged then, but if so, it would have to been bugged more recently If it were bugged short term, we'd have heard more about this.

You can check the gemstory history in its wiki page.

It just got removed September 9.

It would be cool if we could click any gemstore skin in the wardrobe and unlock it, just paying a more when it's off the store. You could go  to the wardrobe, lick the hat, pay 500 instead 400 gems, and just buy it right there.

But there's no such option at this time.

Primordus didn't always make destroyers that looked like that. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_Wiki:Projects/NPC_models/Destroyers
---
In Eye of the North, ritualist and mesmer destroyers looked a bit more like mursaat or seer. Still twisted, but floating humanoid creatures. 
---
My personal theory is that he makes his minions out of twisted 'templates' of creatures his minions throw into destroyer hives to burn and die.  
---
Grab a troll, throw it in the hive, now he can make destroyer trolls which look like a twisted version of a troll. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/Shared_Model_Project/D#Destroyers
---
His destroyers probably only had underground creatures to work with near their hives, like cave trolls and deep crabs, and that would be why most of his minions like that now.
---
Not that shade of purple though!
---
Then OP would still come here to complain because he wants those merchants to be relevant for **end game**. I do think the kind of gear they sell should be bumped a bit for people leveling up in those zones, so they aren't completely useless, but they don't have to be relevant for end game IMO.
---
The Anet white knights like to say "bUt ThEy ArE oNlY cOsMeTiC iTeMs."  That is 100% besides the point and moving the goal posts.  It's still gambling for items.  Yes, BLC are loot boxes.  They prey on the same kind of people that p2w loot boxes do: that feeling that just 1 more chest will get that item you covet, just 1 more...
---
they do have a, sort of, pity timer, with statuettes but stuff isn't added to them for months so that's kind of a non-factor especially with millennials who MUST HAVE EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.
---
Generally, DH has higher dmg while firebrand has more utility. Its hard to tell what you are missing without seeing your traits and such. And yes, 3 viper pieces and no power runes make a difference. You are missing out on ferocity as well as extra stat. If you use the same gear with firebrand, then girebrand would prob do more dmg because they have a lot more burning in the kit.
---
At the rate we're going we'll have 6 raid wings a decade if the game lasts that long.
---
I see kourna kind of high on the list but when I went there everyone said that the map is crap for farming gold? so how do you actually farm it? is it just meta and boxes or are there other things?
---
SAD
---
That's how the game is built, everyone has the same problem. Guild Wars 2 is a cpu bottlenecked game and upgrading the gpu, while making it look pretty, doesn't increase fps most of the time as many (including myself) have learned.
---
You either don't spend enough time on the subreddit then, or only look at the top-rated posts.
---
Any time a new loot box comes out, or new black lion items are added, people bring up the loot box argument and in every single comment section there is at least one person defending them or saying that its "only cosmetics" who is downvoted into oblivion.
---
Interesting! I totally didn't even think of the idea that Primordus does more "creating" than corruption, but I guess most everything we've met so far other than Primordus has some aspect of corruption to it. Or rather, it chooses to "corrupt stone" the same way that other dragons corrupt life.
---
It still makes me wonder why Primordus chose to make things like crabs and trolls instead of other forms as well, but I guess that answers the whole "sentient beings" thing.
---
Oh lol, if you are comparing power DH and condi FB with that gears, then FB has the inherent advantage. I believe both power DH and condi FB output similar lv of burst and dps so then it would just come down to preference
---
Has this always been an issue
---
Prob about a month or so after the warclaw came out
---
&gt; I also disagree with your fact-like statement that BLC are loot boxes
---
They're boxes that you pay to open and you get random items, that's a loot box.
---
Me knowing what i can get doesn't change that. I know what items i might get if i open a loot box in Overwatch, will you try to defend them by saying that's NOT a loot box?
---
Game streaming is the solution to this for me. I can hop between all the games now, but I finish even fewer, but it's fun.
---
no because they can only be earned in game, not bought in the gem store.
---
While an absence of a preview function of its contents seems to be a prerequisite for a container to be called a loot box by this study, they dont define every container that doesnt have a preview function as loot box.
---
I'm saying something different. Compared to most multiplayer games, this community is friendlier. Part of that has to do with the less competitive nature of open world PvE and part of it has to do with the design of the game over all.  It's harder to troll so less trolls by percentage find a home here. Its just simple logic.
---
Compared to WoW this game has a much better community. I don't even want to begin comparing it to League of Legends. 
---
But yes there are other MMOs who have friendly communities. Not as many that are more active than this game though.
---
Tried that combo and nothing happens -_-
---
I switch off between playing FB and DH.  FB  has more survivability.  When I played DH I played arrow and  GS with high 100% crit, high ferocity and crit traits.  I had Radiance / Virtues / DH traits .  Most mobs and group of mobs die before they even get close to me.  If they get close I switch to GS and finish them off.  Pretty good build.  I got bored after a while because it wasn’t as fun as FB.
---
Check out the *GW2 Artist Collective*.  They're a group of over 100 artists that create beautiful collaborative projects.  They're familiar with the races and lore of GW2, so your commission will be consistent with the world of Tyria.
---
Here is a [list of contributors](https://gw2collective.tumblr.com/post/186129392103/tyrian-gazette-welcome-to-our-contributors-were) to their current project with links/contant information.
---
Asura are the race that has been seen corrupted by dragons the least times.
---
There's risen asura, and that's it.
---
One could think that dragons consider their bodies too weak to use, but there's risen asura.  
---
So maybe their minds can endure corruption better.  
---
That'll explain why Zojja's blighted clones could hold back and speak, while Logan's simply attacked, and why all corrupted asura we've seen are risen, since corpses have no mind to resist.
---
Then they fucked up because almost every lootbox reveals their contents, you always know what you might get, even in mobile gaming.
---
Buys gems with money, then convert gems to gold, then buy PoUG.
---
Ugg it's stuff like this that makes me taste bitter when someone suggests they can skip Season 2. I think we are beyond the point of Sunk Cost since so -few- players have experienced Season 1. It's new content, we just already know the outcome. Maybe take it as a opportunity to teach mechanics essential for HoT.
---
I've done this collection a few months ago, and I remember being upset about the drop rate also, but no idea by now how many times I've killed Vinewrath... look at it the other way though, you might get lucky and get an infusion drop with those attempts (ye, the chances are................)
---
Never enough.
---
Your point being ?
---
It’s heavily regulated, you can just open your casino out of nowhere.
---
Having it recognized as gambling would mean that it would need to respect certain regulations for it to be legal in the UK.
---
It also took me very long to get that drop, so it's probably the normal bad RNG.
---
I mean there's always going to be at least one person saying the opposite when you talk about anything, but it's not like there's some large number of people saying this.  The overwhelming majority of comments agree that they are loot boxes.
---
Heavy regulation doesn't seem to prevent there being a paddypower seemingly on every corner. My point being is that if Anet follows the regulation (probably mostly having the account owner be over 18), lootboxes will be able to continue to exist
---
I can understand that causing under-utilization, but OP makes it sound like 0% usage of the eGPU in favor of the integrated graphics.  Is this what you've experienced as well and dx12 fixed it?
---
Coordinate positioning mismatch with charr, am not surprised. When will they do some testing for ALL races, instead of just humans.
---
There have been successfull roadmaps, for example Warframe has a regularone. Knowing what's coming and having some timing on that would re-assure a lot of people.
---
&gt;the difference between Unids and BLC keys is that you can basically "spawn" new BLC keys out of nothing by spending gems in the shop.
---
&gt;Unids can only be spawned by earning them in game.
---
This distinction makes no difference. Both are still gambling.
---
I think they’re saying that the items are highly desirable. So people will throw money at the chests to get them because there’s nowhere else to obtain them.

Here's a painting I did recently of my norn ranger. :) I love drawing sylvari and I'm willing to draw for gold/gems but please let me know your budget!
---
Oh, I've heard that PLENTY of times. Maybe not in this thread, or possibly not in this game (since cosmetics are recognized as the *most( important thing in this game), but plenty of general discussions about loot boxes pull the "it's just cosmetics" argument, especially around Overwatch.
---
I am not surprised someone posted this here...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I don't know if this, **Immersive and addictive technologies**, report might do good? I assume the UK is equally, less or more, corporate alike the US... I at least know the FTC's look into Loot Boxes is a shot in the dark, being a big-fat "IF"  the US will regulate or ban. Imo, Loot Boxes have too many conflicting issues to be worth gambling regulations . . . I hope the UK will ban them out of existence, with more nations following the example of Belgium.
---
When the value of the best potential reward exceeds the value of the worst potential reward.
---
Friendliest Community does not mean that every single person is awesome.  Sorry to break it to you but every game has its assholes and gw2 is no exception.  When people say that gw2 has the friendliest commuity, they're talking about overall and compared to other games and I tend to agree.  I've played a lot of mmos and this game on average is helpful and nice, especially in pve.
---
Revealing what you MAY get is very different from revealing the actual reward.
---
Fortnite Save the World used to have loot boxes like BLC, but at the end they were just loot boxes with random reward. Now, they changed the system, so you can actually see what you are paying for. It's up to you to consider if the content is valuable or not. If you buy one box, a next one will be randomly generated and replace the one you bought.
---
That's what they mean with "revealing the content".
---
&gt; That definition *technically* still says BLC chests are lootboxes. BLC reveals their *potential* content. Not their content that you get if you click open. That's sort of... a game of chance. Gambling.
---
Thats actually an interesting point I havent considered.
---
But I think its still up to debate, if BLC are included in this definition because they do give you 2 guaranteed previewable drops out of 3 (or out of 4 if you get a bonus item).
---
Yay!
---
&gt; The definition they give is intended to read 'what that particular box will contain'
---
then why didnt they use that definition?
---
When do you think it will be back again?🤔
---
Not every game of chance is considered gambling. Otherwise a rune or sigil with a 50% chance to proc on hit/crit or whatever would be considered gambling too.
---
Ok, awesome! I know there are a lot of great gw2 artists out there but if you're interested in my stuff feel free to send me a PM with more specific descriptions of what you're looking for in the drawing! :D
---
That’s not a problem, that’s true for any and all live games since the dawn of games, and will never be solved, ever.
---
Once players catchup to the burst of content that comes with launch, they become bored and return in cycles for content patches, unless they’re completionists and collectors, in which case they are usually decoupled from content drops since they come and go in burnout phases.
---
It’s also not all veteran players leaving, Veteran hardcores still login daily or weekly to do raids and CMs and the like, WvW’ers max out their tracks or chase ranks, PvP’ers do their seasonal track. Just that they might not do much outside of their game mode cause they’re finished with other content or aren’t interested.
---
Veteran casuals, like me, likely have a mountain of content left to climb and chase, but since I don’t want to play just GW2 all day everyday, and alot of it is timegated or designed for long-term play there’s no reason to go balls mode, e.g why rush map completion when I can easily tell with a calculator I still need 2-3 months to get enough coins and mats for my next legendary? Just do some casual play.
---
&gt; they do have a, sort of, pity timer, with statuettes but stuff isn't added to them for months so that's kind of a non-factor especially with millennials who MUST HAVE EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.
---
Yep you can see this effect right now with the Starborn outfit.
---
It gets said plenty of times in these debates usually.
---
I like lootboxes and gambling, whether with an official currency or another. I'm cool with limited regulations, but I hope they don't flat out ban gambling in games or pressure developers to get rid of it. (RIP Game Corner)
---
It’s worth having both a full Viper ascended set and a full Berserker ascended set for your Guaridan.  Firebrand can use both Viper and Berserker sets, and DH is full Berserker.  Power Firebrand is a Quickness-spamming build that works well in groups, especially alongside a Revenant spamming Alacrity to the group.
---
It might affect game ratings like the "E" for everyone and such... Not that those matter much in the current games market
---
They did, though they could have been more specific with their use of language I suppose.
---
It’s not entirely true, alot of veterans with their ranks in the thousands can max their tracks in a day or two and just farm mode, especially commanders.
---
You are right but in that case, the container which includes the desert explorer kit and is available for purchase in the gem store is the gambling aspect, not the unid gear it may contain.
---
the peerless infusion already has its own issues, with certain animations it drops into your character's hand
---
Ecto gambling? cool. BLC and Mount Licenses? Not so cool.
---
I don't see how loot boxes are any less ethical than lotteries, neighborhood poker parties, or the entire economy of Las Vegas.  It's gambling, and like most vices is fine and enjoyable for many in small doses, but bad in excess.
---
Automatic up vote for all posts related to less visual clutter.
---
I'm not sure I understand the point of the question? Do you mean like how in BLTCs you get "some random stuff" and *also* get "this other thing that is guaranteed each time?"
---
Yes, that is disregarded. Being guaranteed "something" does not negate that there is still a randomized item. 
---
Basically, think of it like this, the total baseline value of a BLTC chest would be the *average* value of *all* the items received after opening *all* the boxes that have been opened with that loot table. 
---
*Each* BLTC would have a *specific* value based on the contents of that box, with each item being weighted based on its specific rarity. Since you are guaranteed a Statuette, that would have a value of exactly 1/4 of a baseline box. The other 3/4 could be higher than the baseline if they include high value items, or lower than the baseline if they are of more common rarity. If the total value of the box you open is less than the baseline value, then you have lost the gamble. The fact that this possibility exists is what makes it "gambling," and that remains the case *whether* you win or lose at the gamble.
---
&gt; The fact that you can open some for free is irrelevant if you can also open some for purchase.
---
I failed to find the section of the report that includes this definition, can you quote it?
---
Yeah, but it's exactly the people with illnesses or don't know better that are the people that need these protections.
---
Are you serious right now...?
---
You want to compare 2 different specs but you dont even bother gearing one properly and then question if it will have a difference.. bruh.
---
Potentially, yes. I think there would be a different solution though, like making lootboxes only available to a part of the audience.
---
My experience with necro's minions says it's a bad idea. I don't want to kill every mob in the map because my brainless companion takes agro from everything in 5k range.
---
Please. Don't.
---
And also the target audience.
---
Loot boxes being addictive put it up there with liquor, cigarettes and caffeine. In the case of liquor and cigarettes, they both do more damage and ruin more lives than loot boxes, on a much larger scale. I'm relatively sure few people get killed by cancer from loot boxes and almost none of them are killed by people driving under the influence of a loot box. 
---
I agree these need to be regulated, but I wonder how many people who agree banning this would also be willing to ban alcohol or cigarettes, when in fact, both are more dangerous and over the cost of a lifetime, probably cost the tax payer more. 
---
Just a question everyone should be asking.
---
I'm a guy who buys black lion keys, usually 25 at a time, and never more than once a month (but many months I don't buy them). I like taking a chance on something periodically and I acknowledge it's gambling. 
---
The question is, how much intervention should the government be called on to change this. And what else should they change if you believe this should be changed.
---
Also happens with Aurora
---
Yeah PvE in general is more of a goldmine, thanks to the predictability a dedicated group can get more and more efficient, raid sellers make alot but they play countless hours selling runs and CM’s, so it’s not really a viable option for 99% of players who don’t want to play GW2 all day every day, or who have a life.
---
I’d say casual PvE, i.e pugging dungeons and raids, metas, fractals etc. is on par with WvW.
---
Sounds great
---
gamers: Of course video games don't cause violence! There's even an age-rating on them so children aren't exposed to violent content. Be a better parent.
---
also gamers: loot boxes are turning ten year olds into gambling addicts who will be selling themselves to the streets to pay off their debts by 18 and die of an overdose by 20. governments MUST ban them. no, i'm not just inducing what-about-the-children panic because i'm jealous that whales are getting shinier cosmetics more often. what makes you think that?
---
At the moment it's very clear. A game of chance is only called gambling  when you play for real world valuables.
---
Tbh I would't change this at all. People won't bet their homes on unsellable ingame items in hope to get their money back. This makes it very different from real gambling. The addicted gambler always sees gambling as a way to get their belongings back making it more and more addictive the more they lost.
---
I would certainly push for another law that regulates these no value boxes. I find they need different regulation and they need a different name to not devalue the term gambling. I think in addition to all anet already had in place (no doubles, certain point where you can buy it for sure, ingame earnable, definitiv loot) they should be even more consumer friendly meaning all items in these can be sold/bought ingame. So no unsellable exclusives.
---
For sure you can downvotes and just plain say lootboxes=gambling but law says so otherwise and they certainly are different at a cruicial point.
---
&gt; All of the points I brought up honestly make me think it's a matter of perception more than anything.
---
Yes, perception is the key issue here and obviously different people will have different opinions but in the end, it only matters, what legislature will state.
---
Personally, I also think that BLC are some kind of gambling and the game should at least have a PEGI/ESRB simulated gambling label and a label for in game micro transactions (which doesnt exist yet) and in consequence a higher age rating.
---
But I dont know if its really neccessary to put it under the same regulations (gambling licenses) as casinos for example, depending on how the funds generated through those licenses will be used by the government.

For Unids I dont share the same concerns (and I dont see many, if any complaints about them). They basically give you the same odds and loot table as before when you killed a mob and back then, nobody called random loot drops from mobs gambling either.
---
Ok, the difference now is that you can trade the loot roll on the tp for gold with other players but there are plenty of other common game mechanics in GW2 that depend on chance and are purchaseable via gold on the tp, for example regular loot bags (without high value low droprate items on the loot table) or runes/sigils which have a **chance** to proc under certain conditions (for example on hit) and provide a significant buff (p2w?) to your stats, if they do.
---
Should these be ruled gambling as well?
---
I am fine with regulating gambling but if we fail to define gambling properly, we run the risk of overregulation.
---
Zerker DH is amazing to play with very satisfying bursts, some survivability and nice cc.
---
Well, people seem to be in favor of a "just ban this ffs" regulation nowadays. Brilliant plan.
---
&gt; Only if you had to spend money each time you wanted it to check whether it procced (or pay a lump sum at some point that offered a fixed number of proc attempts).
---
I dont have to spend money to get keys either but a can spend money to get the chance of the sigil proccing.
---
&gt; Basically, think of it like this, the total baseline value of a BLTC chest would be the average value of all the items received after opening all the boxes that have been opened with that loot table.
---
Yeah, this is where the study seems to disagree in its final recommendation:
---
&gt; We consider loot boxes that can be bought with real-world money and do not reveal their contents in advance to be games of chance played for money’s worth.
---
It doesnt yet specify, if **all** its drops have to be previewed before purchase or if some guaranteed drops are enough to negate the gambling definition.
---
If you think the guaranteed drops are worth the loot box price is subjective just like its subjective if you think a particular skin is worth its price.
---
No, I'm just not looking for a quote from the report for you. I don't have any need to.
---
Yeah the official message there is pretty clear.
---
i admit swtor companions were fun, and the jesusbot in their instances were great if you just wanted to storymode, swtor's mobs were designed with health and attacks so that you needed a companion or 2nd player to get through it and for that matter gw1 instances were the same.
---
the only time you would need heroes in gw2 would be for dungeons, but the ai isnt up to scratch, especially for the boss mechanics.
---
&gt; I dont have to spend money to get keys either but a can spend money to get the chance of the sigil proccing.
---
You don't *have* to spend money to get a key, but you have the *option* to spend money to get a key, and that makes it gambling, just as a casino that allowed you to A. Give them $10 and get 10 $1 chips, or B. Serve drinks for an hour and they'll give you 10 $1 chips, it would still be gambling to spend those chips on a game of chance. 
---
The reason why a sigil is not gambling is because whether you attempt to proc it once, or a million times, the cost you paid is flat, not based on the number of attempted procs.
---
there are a few core story instances where your team is backing you up, but most of the time they just stand there stupidly and do nothing. if you positioned yourself just right they would stand there and get all the agro and do nothing, but allow you to dps with no agro on yourself.
---
i wouldnt build a game mode around that.
---
Under 18’s don’t buy into the lottery, shouldn’t be doing poker bets nor going into Casinos.
---
This game isn’t rated M.
---
Dude's mental, check his posting history. He couldn't leave a good hair on GW2 to save his life. If Anet gifted him a basket full of gold and puppies, he'd just complain about the weight.
---
You obsess about something enough, youi're going to find it everywhere. "But in this thread of 200 comments is at least one person defending it!" Yes. That's normal.
---
Yes, you have to purchase the rune/sigil before you are able to check wether it procs or not. Without a purchase (with gold or RMto gems to gold), you wont be able to check if it procs or not.
---
Hell yeah! I agree 100%.  
---
Lower the gem purchase cost (real life money one), make black lion weapon skins just normally buyable for gems, no rng, and you won't go under. Instead of whales, just make the normal player buy stuff with reasonable prices and appealing, non rng blocked goods for his buck.

Welcome to the circle, take a seat

Huh, this post still exists. It must have slipped through the cracks. Quick, upvote it to hot!
---
While the potential to get loads of money trough tp is there, it can be a risky thing.
---
There are many ways of getting gold, some are safer and some are a bit more risky ofc, and the more gold you have the more you can get .
---
I always played it safe so to speak, and as an active player it got me quite a lot of gold over time.
---
All that being said, i can also say i turned my self towards other "in game" gold making things.
---
various things anyone can do within 10-30min (no fractals, raids, pvp, or farming), in order to get a good amount of gold per day ,and move on to play with other stuff.
---
It made me discover a few amazing ways of getting gold, one of which is where i get about 17g per hour with a lvl 2character just siting in hoelbrak and clicking on stuff (no tp fliping)
---
As for the stream, depends on what you can offer. There are already multiple tp flipping guides on youtube that vaguely describe how its done without actually saying which markets to hit...which is what most people expect from you when they hear about "a guide for flipping and making money"
---
Everyone can still pick up banners.
---
And the entire design of the category is to be a bundle you can put down for your allies. If you removed that functionality it would basically just be an engineer kit with extra steps.
---
Just stop picking them up.
---
I agree with what you said, but if you haven’t try turning off post processing. This game is terrible at balancing lighting.
---
Actually I really like that interaction between players and the world, just like the engineers kits. Also you don't ruin a players rotation because when you use that skill two weapons are generated, one holds the elementalist and one is dropped to the ground.
---
I keep getting my mount stuck in the ground when I use it and it’s irritating. Most of the times, it unstucks itself after a while and I don’t really mind that that much since my laptop is basically a baked popoto so I can’t complain much. However, sometimes, especially in water, I could be stuck for a minute+ without getting unstuck, at which point I just give up and swim instead. Retrying to mount usually doesn’t fix it either. This made my farming sandswept isle nodes such a pain. 
---
I also once got stuck in a rock after dismounting while my mount got stuck. 
---
Anyone has any similar experience or any suggestions? 
---
Another irrelevant question, how do you survive in open world PVE zergs? There’re so many telegraphs both from player and enemies and sometimes it’s not obvious to me which ones are dangerous. Also I think I’m supposed to read some boss abilities from its animations (?) but I often can’t even see the boss with the nameplates covering a significant portion of my screen (I don’t think I could turn off squad member nameplates?) and the blinding battle effects. Well I also usually have &lt;10 FPS and &gt;200 ping when there’s a sizable group but I can’t do much about that except for getting a new computer &gt;.&gt;
---
Gambling is literally a regressive tax that targets addicts.  How do you spin that as ethical?
---
This is the content that keeps alive.
---
Probably because they know they don't make people leave.
---
&gt; Everyone can still pick up banners.
---
um
---
&gt; One could think that dragons consider their bodies too weak to use, but there's risen asura.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; So maybe their minds can endure corruption better.
---
&gt; That'll explain why Zojja's blighted clones could hold back and speak, while Logan's simply attacked, and why all corrupted asura we've seen are risen, since corpses have no mind to resist.
---
That doesn't explain Risen Chickens though. I think it's just exposure, Primordus synthesises minions from rock/magma and thus doesn't *need* living hosts while very few asura hung around the Far Shiverpeaks, the Dragonbrand or the Heart of Maguuma. On that last one I don't recall seeing any Mordrem Norn or Mordrem Charr either even though Mordy should have been able to use the Pact's casualties, he did field fully sapient frog-clones though.
---
Im pretty sure that nobody but the Warrior can pick up its own banners..
---
&gt;Depends on the design of the DLC and the wording of the law.
---
As in all things, but *most* DLC I've ever seen would not run afoul of *likely* anti-lootbox regulation. 
---
&gt; Even something like a WP respawn cost or Queen's Gauntlet Ticket could be defined as a gambling fee depending on how systems and regulations interact.
---
The WP one would be unlikely, the Queen's Gauntlet ticket, maybe, IF you could buy it for cash. 
---
&gt;I'm not saying intentionally leave loopholes in, but if a law requires a large portion of the VG market to completely recreate their in-game economies/rewards when those systems are largely unrelated to the core issue of lootboxes, then that law is too vague and overreaching.
---
Better to get it right on the first try so that developers only have to adapt once. Better for everyone than if they had to adapt over and over again. Loot boxes are so crazy profitable that it would almost always be worth the effort of trying to skirt the law so long as they can.
---
How would you phrase the "you can't buy loot boxes with proxy currency" argument in a way that is not overlay broad? 
---
"Can't buy loot boxes with cash", so can't buy a BLC directly with cash, fine, you can buy it with gems. 
---
"Can't buy it loot boxes with currencies you can purchase with cash", fine, can't buy them with gems, so you can buy them with gold, which you can buy with gems, which you can buy with cash. 
---
"Can't buy it loot boxes with currencies you can purchase with currencies which you can purchase with cash", fine, can't buy them with gems, so you can buy them with "chest tokens," which you can buy with gold, which you can buy with gems, which you can buy with cash. 
---
Etc.
---
You need broad solutions to broad problems, sometimes. You need to make clear that no matter how many steps in between "spend money" and "get RNG," you can't have "RNG rolls per purchase." 
---
&gt;The point of regulation is to nurture an industry that is healthy for producers and consumers. They should shape/guide, not create a minefield or shackles.
---
Sometimes the two go hand in hand. Some industries need shackles to prevent them from exploiting their customers. 
---
&gt;I think GW2 would be a better game without BLCs, but I don't think it would be a better game without the Gold&lt;&gt;Gem Exchange and the majority of in-game RNG. 
---
I hesitantly agree, but I do believe that they could potentially firewall off the RNG elements from the Gem/gold elements. It would mean removing *some* of the RNG from the game, and a significant number of RNG items currently on the TP, but I think it's doable without removing gold/gem trading entirely. Ultimately though, it's a much bigger thing than just this game, and even if it would leave this game *slightly* worse off overall, it's better for the industry and consumers as a whole. 
---
I do hope they write the laws the best they can be, of course.
---
No, it's because I have no reason to provide you with any quotes. You haven't paid me anything.
---
use the search function or scroll down a bit and you will see that you are not the only one.
---
I used to buy into 'keys can be bought with gold and it is people need to responsible for themselves' arguments. Now they are true to some extent, but I am beginning to think that the target audience for BLC items are people without restraint. 
---
So those it is those who can't limit themselves to buying a reasonable number of keys and/or those unable to save up their gold for a certain time and need to resort to gem purchases to get keys that BLC items are aimed at.
---
&gt; But there is still a chance for it to never proc after spending gold on it, so its not a guaranteed outcome.
---
You aren't paying for an item guaranteed to proc, you're paying for an item that is guaranteed to have a 50% chance to proc each time it hits. This is distinct from purchasing an item where the contents are variable. 
---
If you buy a home slot machine and that slot machine never wins, that it still not purchasing a gamble.
---
Just to let people know how this will work. Parliament is not sitting right now for 5 weeks obviously this is being contested but until its overturned nothing is being done at all. Now when Parliament returns will lootboxes be made illegal no because they'll be back and a Queens Speech will happen which is highly unlikely to include this. Next an MP could introduce a 10 minute rule bill but that can be stopped by someone saying no to it. If a bill is introduced maybe a private members bill it needs to go through all the stages which can be amended, defeated or completely through out. If it does get through it ha to go to the house of lords and once again it can be amended to hell and back. What I'm saying is the UK parliament is confusing and with the turmoil happening here right now with bills being thrown out. No MPs sitting till the Queens Speech in October this will not be in it. I know this is technical but I'm making sure people don't start going "The UK is banning lootboxes". With the Brexit rubbish going on thats ending on Halloween or later, then the UK will have an election, then theres all the stages if a bill is introduced basically lootboxes can't be illegal till at least summer 2020 maybe later. Then theres do you put an age restriction on them which is likely. To cut a long story short lootboxes won't be made illegal completely just have age restrictions on them so someone like me who is 23 would be able to get them whereas someone who is 16 or below won't. I know people won't be interested in the technicalities of the UK parliament it stops people thinking it'll stop people thinking its a done deal.
---
Real world gambling isn't exactly regulated in the UK.
---
I hope they don't ban them from the game. Nobody is forced to buy them, they don't have unfair bonuses and it's fun to open them from time to time.
---
&gt; Lol, it doesn't specify that because it's assumed any sensible reader could figure that out on his own.
---
No, the study doesnt assume any sensible reader can figure this out on their own, in fact, they acknowledge that wether you get your money's worth from guaranteed drops of a lootbox is a rather complicated matter, even for the regulators:
---
&gt; There is quite a lot of case law around what money or money’s worth means, the difference between how you would assess value, the fact that value needs to be objectively assessed rather than in the eye of the beholder, so it is quite a complicated area.
---
And especially for digital economies in the gaming industry, no consense has been agreed upon:
---
&gt; However, this is arguably out-of-step with the digital economies in the games industry. Indeed, Brad Enright acknowledged that the definition of ‘money’s worth’ is an area where the Gambling Commission is “constrained […] by the current legislation.” He told us that that a broader definition of value:
---
&gt; would need a change in legislation, but also in doing that you would have to be very careful not to catch lots of other activities, which may also incorporate expenditure, chance and a prize of value or worth to the player.
---
&gt; I also disagree with your fact-like statement that BLC are loot boxes as being anything else than your personal opinion
---
Except your quoted definition supports BLC being lootboxes? Knowing potential drops has nothing to do with revealing the contents. You do not know specifically all the items that you'll get out of one purchase, thus, a BLC does not reveal their content in advance of your purchase.
---
I'd find it helpful, would definitely appreciate teaching vids.
---
As others have pointed out, I think you are grossly misinterpreting what the report means by "reveal their contents." They didn't say "reveal the possible contents." It's quite clear the distinction they are making is between randomly available items where you know exactly what you are getting from that specific purchase before you confirm the purchase, and items where you know what's possible to get but not the exact result you will get from a specific purchase until after you have already made said purchase.
---
The law isn't written yet, this is just a recommendation of actions. so we don't actually know what will technically fall in or outside the law... and even though BLC are the least offensive for of loot boxes I've ever encountered...  I would expect in the wake of this report, given the significance of it's UK servers ANET is looking to change the Chests, frankly speaking... even if they remain legal for now, I doubt they will want to risk it anything questionable.
---
It's not a paradox. People are looking for others who have already completed the raid and are experienced, and thats how they find those people. New players should find a group looking for beginners or first time clearing.
---
Actually its not theres a bill happening right now to heavily regulate it and like I said or didn't in my pot above with no Parliament sitting right now  all current bills from last session will be thrown out.
---
Exactly.
---
that is so badass and awesome, i would actually go back and try to record it
---
The difference here is that the 1p token has a specific value (1p) and that value is less than what you put into the slot machine.
---
The guaranteed drops from the BLC only have a subjective value, so its harder to argue that the money you put in is less than the personal value you get out of it.
---
Gambling is a service existing in the world for, like, ever? An least its is supposed to be, for responsible people it's just yet another way to obtain good called "entertainment" in exchange for currency. Addiction is concerning matter, just like in case of video games, tabletop games, television, alcohol, tobacco.. And any other "good" which sole existence on the market is to provide "entertainment" to consumer.
---
Gambling is a product of mechanics, not payout.
---
&gt; No one is denying it. I think there is a form of self-righteousness at play when statements like that are made in the middle of groups who agree.
---
the gw2 community will often act like bltc is fine because they arent EA loot boxes. its not that they deny they meet the definition, it's that they're blinded by the game so much and that nothing about it could be wrong that they sweep them under the rug
---
Yeah, i'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that you're just fighting enemies that are higher than your character level.  If you're Lv20, go to Brisban, Kessex Hills, Snowden Drifts, or Diessa Plateau.
---
&gt; Norn are much harder to catch alive as they'd rather die in battle than surrender, but it'll likely be a matter of time after that if we didn't stop him. 
---
He had gained the domain of Death and using corpses was a plot point in several story instances.
---
&gt; As for charr, just look at mordrem grunts and mordrem menders. They coincidentally started appearing after Mordremoth Attacked Iron Marches.
---
*Menders*, really? *That* is the best use for the charr template? And why would a remote attack on some small fort or farmstead yield results so much faster than the Pact staging ground in the Silverwastes followed by the entire fleet crashing right on top of Mordy?
---
We didn't see any Mordrem Chak, White Mantle(/Bandits) or Rata Novus asura either IIRC, to me this is just them being lazy/efficient with their animation skeletons the same way oakhearts and minotaurs share a rig.
---
They got me at first part, not gonna lie.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d3lnuh/unknown_error/
---
I believe you are misinterpreting the definition. IMO, its not referring to the ability to preview the possible drops, but the ability to preview the ***exact*** 4 or whatever number of drops you'll get before purchasing the content.
---
there is a difference between regulation and banning outright. for example while lootboxes are considered gambling in Belgium, gambling is still allowed. 
---
However, none of the companies that have lootboxes are going to implement the required systems to allow gambling any time soon and at the same time the ruleset for this specific type of gambling hasn't been set up to allow for granting licenses specific for it so at the moment they are just not allowed here.
---
A lot of the rules regarding gambling here are about the protection of the vulnerable part of the target audience, basically detecting problematic spending and preventing people that have these issues from even being able to spend money once identified, even if they were identified elsewhere.
---
Likewise smoking and drinking is regulated to some degree. Will there be people that try to circumvent these regulations? of course, but regulations are there to protect the majority of them and at least you can offically try to do something about people breaking the law. unlike when you have lootboxes in a system that has no applicable laws like in a lot of places now.
---
I think loot boxes are less ethical than lotteries and poker, but equal to slot machines.  You know the exact odds of winning the lottery.  Do you know the odds of getting a perma contract?  Anet could tell you (they won't), but can they prove it?  So they are worse than lottery because you don't even know the odds of your bet.
---
And children can't gamble.  Is it illegal for them to buy loot boxes?
---
Black Lion Chests where a think way before microtransactions become so big with mobile games and sports games and those are way more egressive and abusive towards your gambling addictions, comparing them with gw2 version is a fk joke.
---
Another thing not to forget is that gw2 is a 12 year old rated game and most of those mobile/sports game are intentional pushed for rated to be everyone, even tho more and more of those games are literally casino games now (just look at this [NBA2k20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-BuUqsd71w))
---
Yes, there were some bozos that were white knights about loot boxes, they used to come in and burry you in down votes for speaking Ill about their beloved gambling. Now they are all silent and good riddens for that.
---
Damn... Should have clicked that one. Just 40 mins ago...my bad -.-
---
TBH, I don't feel Black Lion Chest are Loot Box : I Mean 50% of the content is sure ans usefull. The Other 50% are pure luck.  
---
Moreover, we can buy the black Lion chest without paying a single € / £ / $ , because we can trade Gold to Gem.
---
I agree with this mainly because it's easier for a kid to get/steal some cashmoney from parents, than to use a credit card without the odd transactions being noticed.
---
But despite agreeing, I don't actually think it's possible to regulate trading cards, at least not wth a massive infrastructure change - trading card membership cards you scan at tills that track and limit your purchasing? Great, get your friends who don't care to sign up and use their cards too!
---
It is not possible to make it *impossible* for these people to get into trouble. It *is* possible to make it *less likely* that these people will get into trouble. There are actual personal stories of people who knew they were gambling addicts, had managed to recover some degree of balance, started playing a game that they did not understand including gambling mechanics because those were not front and center, and then either started making use of these mechanics without even realizing it, or did recognize that it was a gambling mechanic but by that point they were too close, and ended up falling back into gambling patterns. 
---
Addiction means that you will always *struggle* with a problem, it does not mean that you can never *manage* the problem. People do manage to remain "sober" for long periods of time. Ideally society can help make that easier. 
---
Even setting aside actual addiction, even in non-addictive people it can result in unhealthy spending habits.
---
They did? AFAIK it says "let you preview it's contents", which BLC certainly doesn't do, BLC lets you preview every possibility, not the specific contents before you pay money.
---
&gt; From my understanding, the report is saying that loot boxes should be regulated further. Which is fine, so long as other addictive randomisation mechanics (e.g. Lol surprise eggs, blind bag purchases) are also covered as they can be equally damaging and target even younger audiences. 
---
There's no requirement that the two go hand in hand. It's possible to regulate one thing and not another. If they *do* go after those other items, that's fine too.
---
But those don't require you to spend real money or grind gold for hours like it's your second job
---
&gt; I believe you are misinterpreting the definition. IMO, its not referring to the ability to preview the possible drops, but the ability to preview the exact 4 or whatever number of drops you'll get before purchasing the content.
---
yes, its up to debate what they mean because they havent made that definition clear.
---
that second pic :eyes: sir
---
No, we don't want fucking casual play. "but gw2 is a casual game!" yes it is now, but those weren't the premises of the game, that's why hardcore players are upset. Just tell us you want to focus on your casual playerbase so we can find something better instead of "noooo we working on pvp and wvwvw and raids don't worry" but never deliver. Also yes, all games eventually starts losing Players, the difference is that gw2 doesn't make any efforts to stop that even though they could easily catch the leaving players attention with some actual content and marketing strategies
---
Because Microsoft is nothing but consistent.
---
this is the exact overexaggerated bullshit why devs wont listen to guys like you.
---
"they dont even try" what a colossal moron you are....
---
Conjures are usually just used to buff your other skills. Unless the ele doesnt understand the build then picking up a conjure wont actually "screw" over their whole rotation, they will just have to use a couple more autoattacks instead.
---
It's like almost having the game in the game news cycle because it's getting an update is a smart and practical way to market your game, weird. Who would have thought that updates would attract new players...hmmmmmm
---
part of the reason why this is true to some extent is because GW2 is designed in a way where you do not compete for goods, as loot is individual, based on participation. You'll see the nasty side in any game when competition becomes a serious factor(which why chat in PVP is toxic at times, and higher level instanced content). Because of the horizontal progression that GW2 has, no one competes for better equipment or has to go through a grind to get better armor that vertical progression based MMO's have. The tradeoff is that the game becomes slightly more casual, and some players get lost when hitting the level cap on what to do (as in a vertical progression game, its usually clear that you need X gear to complete Y content, which allows you to do Z content in a looping fashion, which isn't true for horizontal games, as pve content is accessible but goals are spread out and not linear or as well defined)
---
Judging by your cringing reaction, it sounds like the "writers" elicited exactly the kind of response they wanted from you. :D
---
This meme points out a serious flaw in sPvP design. Overwatch's Jeff Kaplan once mentioned why they did not implement more than one payload for maps, one for each team. They experimented with the idea, but they quickly noticed that going with more than one objective in a fast-paced games causes disorientation between players. You do too much multi-tasking. It works for MOBA genre, since the character progression is slow. But sPvP does not have that system. You can go all out at the very beginning of the match.   
---
If you think about it, multiple objectives are impossible  even for MOBAs. At the beginning, there is a laning phase, yes, but the end-game dynamic about is winning "a" team fight and destroying "one" objective at a time, and doing those "all together".
---
Gw2 isnt really made for a hero/henchman system at all.
---
Gw2 in fact tries to move away from passive abilities and ai.
---
Besides necro minions, everything else is just temporary ai summon which are there for a few bursts and then they are gone
---
As much as I'd love to see that, I think a big part of flipping is simply experience. The more you flip the more you realize what sells and what doesn't - but most people expect an immidiate profit and quit when disappointed, or simply don't have the money to flip.
---
I don't think anyone will reveal his secret flips for anyone to see because it'll just remove his profits, so general guides tend to be vague and lacking.
---
Good luck with that!
---
Even when you log on the Launcher?  
---
But it was a change that was brought about 2 weeks ago, during the "PAX, not PAXY" event.
---
The didnt say that only a loot box that  "lets you preview its contents" is not considered gambling they said a loot box that "does not reveal its contents" should be considered gambling,  which is a big difference in definition.
---
Technically, the BLC doesnt fall under either definition because it doesnt reveal **all** drops (only 2 out 4 guaranteed).
---
I am sure the study left this definition vague or ommitted the definition of partly predetermined guaranteed drops on purpose because they dont have the power to make this decision, only the lawmakers and regulators that ordered this study can.
---
And obviously, this hasnt happened yet.
---
Both work perfectly fine. So do a lot of other variations.
---
I'm assuming you are mostly running with public Zergs? Then I would recommend Celestial over Power gear. It gives you more defense, which is always handy in a public. Helps with surviving small mistakes or when group compositions aren't ideal.
---
It's also a lot more flexible overall and for example allows you to swith to blood magic if your Zerg needs more support.
---
ANet should totally give us the option to Flush Gold :P (Not the Mystic "Toil..." ahem... Forge Way.)
---
Instal 'gyazo', it makes little gifs or screens or replays, easy and neato :)
---
&gt; 0.25-0.5p is still a specific value that can be put into direct relation of the value you put in. So in your example the guaranteed pay out is considerably less compared to the price you pay for a roll (assuming one roll costs 1 quarter or 20p).
---
I meant the value varies depending on which prize you pick at the trade-in counter. Is it illegal to sell a tiny plush or a 2GB USB drive at 10x the supermarket price tag? Does there only need to be one single value-appropriate option since every customer can just pick that one?
---
BLC and gemstore items both have zero public market value because they cannot be traded for legal tender (without violating ToS). If the in-house value of a digital item/"service" is an acceptable standard then casinos can use that exact same loophole - sell the tokens directly for more than the cost of a spin, but only trade them in for worthless junk or digital goods.
---
Actually, mace skill 2 deals quite a lot of dmg early game.
---
Its quite a spammy large aoe.
---
Mace/axe gives plenty of kiting potential, slowing targets down, and mass aoe cc from axe.
---
However later on you might wish to change up your build, or focus on adding more condi dmg on your gear.
---
All that being said, keep your weapon and armor up to date, dont be afraid of switching between 2 legends (twice as many heals and abilities!)
---
I played trough lvl 40(queensdale&gt;harathi hinterlands) with a single main hand sword and barely any shiro skills at all and i was just fine.
---
Later on you will unlock many skills, legends, and traits which can combo and support eachother in a lot of ways (id say even more so than with some other professions).
---
Tweaking traits, legends, runes, gear, and weapons will allow you to play in many ways as revs are pretty versatile.
---
Looks more asura than char to me 🤣
---
your skirting the bigger question, which is that lootboxes are accessible to kids while most of your examples are not. kids cant buy tobacco, alcohol or go to a casino/gambling house, they are protected because the society at large accepts that since they lack the mechanisms required to cope with this activities responsibly they have to be protected
---
why are lockboxes given free pass? they are exactly the same
---
Guess I won't rezz downed players anymore then.
---
It doesn't change much, part of having a rotation is knowing how to adapt and improvise
---
*gasp* NO WAY
---
I'm going to chime in with the others here. I think people know that GW2 has always had a cash shop and lootboxes. It is just that for the most part, or shall I say, in the past they were known to run a fair deal. There was a focus on the game and not just the shop so people cared less. There were also not legendary-tier content in the lootboxes so people could usually flip the contents on the ingame market for a modest but not unsubstantial price. That gave the players a perspective that it was fair and possibly even added something to the game where you had the option to get the items or fashion in different ways on a relatively fair balance.
---
The Black Lion stuff has only come under fire recently as more attention has been spent on the shop than on the game or because they've added a bunch of stuff to the shop that far surpasses ingame options of achieving them. Things like spacetittes or infusions, things that are account bound and not resellable and so on. That is how they turned from simply having a cash shop and lootboxes to running it just as predatory as every other company under fire.
---
It's very good do you paint/draw a lot?
---
I do as Ranger because it lets me get a jump on tanky characters from above :p
---
&gt; We know from Kralkatorrik that it takes a while for them to get a hang of the different abilities they get with those powers. Kralkatorrik didn't start creating death-branded, branding and hivemind minions right away. He left after Balthazar was defeated, and returned later. It took him a while longer to get the hang of making mist portals. 
---
They do immediately gain the powers themselves though, Kralk already revived a devourer on the way out. Either way Mordy, according to you, attacked the charr and successfully assimilated them but then failed to do so for asura, humans and norn far *later*. 
---
&gt; There was lots of pact members of all races dead and alive alive all over maguuma. Yet we don't see the first human and asura being replicated alive until get save Logan and Zojja.
---
Which is why I believe those were a special case, an attempt to clone body **and mind** simultaneously to create a sapient champion-level minion capable of using all skills and wisdom of the original. Zhaitan managed this by enslaving souls and Mordy already had the Mordrem Guard but I don't recall seeing anything like it in Icebrood or Branded.
---
&gt; As for the chak, it appears they are naturally resistant to mordremoth. It maybe be because of their natural magic filtering abilities. It'll be like trying to eat parasites that will feed on you instead when you put them in your belly.
---
Maybe, I also think the vertical scale in-game is *waaay* off and they are supposed to have had very little physical contact but the same can not be said for the White Mantle, Bandits, Centaurs and any other random jungle mobs with no shown Mordrem equivalents. Mushrooms might be too different biologically but if maggots are fair game why not spiders, bats, sparkflies (moths :P), boars, beetles...
---
Thats part of the Flute set, and its only one tool, I mean a whole set, the Flute set is based on wasp not Ice.
---
&gt; It sounds like you'd prefer dropping a hammer on the industry; I'd prefer they drop a clever, then surgically cut out any remaining issues.
---
I'd prefer a single surgery that solves most of the problems in one go to death by a thousand cuts. I'm not considering a regulation that is completely oblivious to the potential harms, they should try to consider both all negative consequences AND all potential loopholes when crafting their rules, I just feel that they need to be broad enough to cover their bases and not just be laser focused on a single symptom of the problem. 
---
Also, any game business that would be fatally wounded by the removal of loot boxes, deserves to bleed out. 
---
&gt;If you define lootbox well enough, this wording would suffice for the majority of cases.
---
Ok, I'm listening. . .
---
&gt;This is the exception, not the rule. If the shackles are too heavy, an industry dies or escapes. But even before that, they can stifle creativity and startups.
---
Sure, but better that than that they continue in a harmful state. All regulations will limit some creative options, that doesn't make them a bad thing. Some creative options *need* to be limited because they are *bad ideas.* Creative people can be just as creative in finding solutions that move forward without crossing the regulation.
---
&gt;I think you're underestimating the impact your suggested level of regulations would have on GW2 and the industry as a whole.
---
That's the fault of the industry (and ANet) wrapping their entire business models around a corrupt element like gambling in the first place. It's like complaining that the opioid crackdown is really mean to pharmaceutical companies and might hurt their business. The industry can start getting ahead of this any time they like and remove the loot box mechanics on their own.
---
I opened few of them and , frankly... they're full of useless crap. all other boxes later I just sale unopened.
---
&gt;I should know, barely an alt of mine that I leveled purely by using what dropped that wasn't in rags. These merchants were always a great help.
---
...how??? I started playing this summer and after seeing around level 30 that dropped gear outperformed vendor gear even 5-10 req. levels above, I stopped checking. I've never played a game that throws so much loot at your face before for doing anything. Unless you actively avoid pressing the F key to loot stuff, I fail to see how you can even level up a lot without getting gear dropped.
---
Thank you I spent at least 37 seconds thinking very hard about it
---
They're intelligent, but vicious.
---
&gt; As jealous, hateful creatures, harpies delight in tormenting other intelligent races, sometimes raiding and robbing more for twisted amusement than out of a desire for wealth.
---
I wouldn't want to try to have a peaceful interaction with them... And if we believe the legends saying that they used to be servants of Dwayna but eventually fell, and since hate "everything that walks on the ground", well... Diplomatic interactions are probably a bad idea.
---
But it would be interesting to have something else than "MATRIARCH TAKE YOU" when we come to them.
---
&gt; any game business that would be fatally wounded by the removal of loot boxes, deserves to bleed out.  ...[their fault for] wrapping their entire business models around a corrupt element like gambling...
---
But I'm talking about collateral damage.  GW2 and many games like it could most likely survive dropping lootboxes, but would be killed trying to comply with regulations that are too broad.
---
&gt; It's like complaining that the opioid crackdown is really mean to pharmaceutical companies and might hurt their business.
---
My stance is that cracking down on opioids is a good thing, but cracking down on every pill that is potentially harmful would mean requiring a prescription for Tylenol.  Or completely banning opioids would lead to many painful deaths.  Over-regulation can do more harm than good, and be just as damaging as no regulations.
---
Ahh I thought you meant the bill that was being introduced when May was in power which focused on betting machines my bad.
---
*raises hand*
---
Ahh it's the Ashleys! Those beautiful sweethearts!! &lt;3 [Us out on a guild lunch gathering in St. Louis.](#s "https://imgur.com/19Pzl7K")
---
I love both of their cosplays!!
---
I spent $70 in black lion chest the first Halloween GW2 event.  Never got what I wanted.  This was  a great introduction into how loot boxes worked and I've never bought a gamble box in any game ever since.  Thanks for the lesson.
---
Which wont be the case with the next balance patch when their cleanses get halved.
---
Considering that there's a patch soon which will severely reduce the condi cleanse capabilities of scrappers as well as some dps nerf on shades, I think that it's safe to assume that cele scourge will see a comeback, especially for pug zergs where it's already a not bad choice.
---
Why update if everything worked before? Another reason not to upgrade to Win10. Microsoft did it again.
---
Anyway, because Win10 is very inconsistent, automatic updates should be disabled. This prevents many problems. Updates can be installed manually later, after reading KB database what the update does, do you really need it and if there is any reported problems.
---
Still using Win7 here. It stays quiet, do not install unnecessary apps and most importantly, it simply works without a single problem.
---
On the contrary, it grants more depth to the game. Otherwise it would be team fight only and thus only team fight classes would be viable. There would be no more 1v1, no more makro "outsmarting" and the \~10 min games could get reduced to 15s games, because loosing the team fight once would already be enough to know the outcome of the match.
---
You also grossly simplified the MOBA gameplay. Even there exists 4-1 split and in some cases even 1-3-1 split. They too got extra objectives on the map, which are fairly important as well.
---
The possibillity of splitting from group and thus forcing the enemy team to either push 5v4 or have to split themselfs, is what makes these games more makro intens. You can potentially break a strong 5 men comb, if you do the splitt game.
---
\----------
---
That's why I like the old big maps with long travel distances more, than all these team fight focussed small maps. It allows for outplaying heavy teamfight combs by outsmarting them.
---
Let's hope Arena Net actually gives a crap and shows us the chances. Companies like *cough* Gameforge *cough* just refuse to show them so more people will buy them, however that makes the games unplayable in certain countries unless its possible to get around it with a vpn.
---
Yes it's bad that under 18s can use gambling loot boxes, but imo it's up to the parents to know what their child is doing as not to ruin it for the over 18s who don't mind a little gamble.
---
Pretty sure the issue is that it’s not just “that one guy.”
---
*laughs in warrior*
---
Thank you! Actually, I'm an illustrator (freelance) so yeah =).
---
It is for special people.
---
Thank you!
---
Or you block the person and he will not show on your follower list and for the other person you will simple always show offline.
---
I like the follower list. People can see when I get to Bloodtide Coast and they can join me without noting down the name. On the other hand if I need some extra hands, I'd scroll through that list too and poke people from there!
---
Glad there is no longer decenting opinion in my echo chamber, *proceeds to sniff own farts.
---
When there's No Pain No Gain, use Mallyx for boon strip (w/ Kalla).
---
100 CM, Ren's most likely the one to do balls on Arts and solo anomalies on Arkk, based on puggin' (either between you or the warrior).
---
Other than that, just Staff 5 when necessary, press F4 for group alacrity and utilize Soulcleave's Summit when bar's broken.
---
&gt; But I'm talking about collateral damage. GW2 and many games like it could most likely survive dropping lootboxes, but would be killed trying to comply with regulations that are too broad.
---
Again, they should be able to survive either way. Any mechanic that treads too close to loot boxes is asking for trouble. ANet is unfortunately particularly vulnerable only because they have allowed players to buy ingame currency with out of game currency, which a lot of other games have avoided. I think ANet's implementation is innocent enough, but it does mean that way too many of the game's mechanics are, to some degree, a gambling mechanic. 
---
Now, that said, all laws are open to interpretation, and while a broad law applied aggressively *might* consider salvage kits to be loot boxes, they are less likely to bother *prosecuting* it if ANet is chill about it. They don't have time to go after every single game company, they'll pick the worst offenders.
---
&gt;My stance is that cracking down on opioids is a good thing, but cracking down on every pill that is potentially harmful would mean requiring a prescription for Tylenol.
---
Even Tylenol is subject to various labeling and distribution limitations.
---
If it was only this easy. To add on: if diviner stats can be newly added on to a list of selectable, a right click remove is doable.
---
&gt;  ....that was designed to have a 3 man team and you could pick your own hero? 
---
I'd do that sh\*t solo and would be very happy with more difficult PvE challanges! ;p
---
We are not removing the follower list, you like it, by all means keep your followers. There are some people who dislike followers. It is only an option to right click.
---
The fact that you think that adding an existing statset to what is basically a simple list of properties is the same as actively affecting ANOTHER users tells us quite clearly that you have very little understanding of how these things work.
---
Mr. Rytlock here promises us genuine ghosts.

Generally, the fastest way to get 10 points is probably via Minipets and Hero Armors.
---
You need to do a petition first, that ANet answers on petitions
---
Come on, you press A, B appear on my list. I press B, A disappear on your list. Am I wrong? It is already a linked system.
---
Would be hard to do, since they're not available in Belgium, for exactly that reason (and haven't been for like a year, despite Anet "promising" a solution)
---
Anet has lost a lot of respect by not acting on it and just regionally disabling it so they can squeeze as much money out of their playerbase before the hammer inevitably comes down. Suffice to say that while the excessive focus on the cash store has been a pet peeve of mine for a while Anet's actions wrt to gambling (or rather, the sheer lack thereof, despite promising a solution over a year ago) has lead to me not spending a cent anymore and, more importantly, barely playing the game either.
---
I find it hard to support a company that wilfully ignores, or just doesn't  possess, anything resembling a moral compass.
---
Some say 1/3 of the games you certainly lose no matter what, 1/3 you win no matter what and 1/3 you're able to impact to go either way. But that was not the original topic we were talking about, was it?
---
I thought this was about map mechanics only leading to people diverting their attention too much, and I think thats not correct. Or to put it else, the game would not be challenging at all. Imagine we had only one capture point, just to put it in contrast.
---
Pvp should meant to be like this, that is what diverts the different elos, people having a basic understanding of how the different maps work to actively using their design for their advantage.
---
I don't know what elo you're at and of course it gets worse in unranked, but if you want coordinated gameplay you should either raise your mmr, or build up a team to regularly go for ATs.
---
*laughs in stealths and runs away like a little bitch*
---
thats only a build but not a full guide about what to do with aRene on each fractal specifically
---
This person codes
---
Yes, you are wrong.
---
I'm sure the mods relish the change from getting hammered by 250 drama reports an hour. Somehow I'm still hopeful of witnessing the birth of an evergreen meme like Ogden's Hammer, nice armour or NORTH!.
---
so...the same thing I said.
---
True, gambling is in every aspect of gameplay. On any multiplayer game in current age. One could get extra materials while gathering, rare skins or armor/weapon boxes while looting or simply expensive items they'd sell when doing anything.
---
For most working people, time is more valuable than their money since they try to get their kick in that limited time frame they can play. So they want to skip farm when possible, especially if the farm itself is boring. So there is always a demand for getting stuff faster with irl money; be it cosmetic or stat.
---
Current problem has children and addicts in core. We pay for something we can't sell. I had a friend in high school back then, who had best meta magic cards. His parents were doing fine and he was collecting them with everthing he gets. Skipped meals, school hours (since he used bus money too) and school tours for the sake of his hobby. Then he started to beg us. Families put a stop only after that. His mother made him sell everything in the end.
---
In the end, we should't be able to access a feature of any game faster with money imo. It's very idealistic and nowadays not possible. But especially children love to flex on their hobbies and hurt themself in the process. If there was an age restriction like actual gambling for example, we probably wouldn't talk about this.
---
You are right that skill factors into it but that is an important factor when talking builds. If you make a build for a pickup-group you make a build for an average or below-average player. The "skill problem" is to be expected.
---
Yup, but the smaller maps reduce the impact of roamers for example. The short running distances make dCapping less effective and make it easier for the one team that won the mod fight to keep controll over the whole map. That's why I like the bigger maps. The possibility to turn the game is much bigger there.
---
Imagine only having one objecive... Now there's no need for a roamer, nor tank, anymore. There's only teamfighters. This would drastically reduce the already small diversity of viable builds.
---
It's not against ToS to use a vpn? I wanted to get the free chest and hunting bond a few weeks ago but I was afraid of getting banned but if it's ok I'll get a vpn.
---
That's a good point! I do not all bosses too because don't like some locations (centaur one) or too long pre-events (pirate/bandid girl one).
---
Which is still considered loot box/gambling because it's blocked in the gem store in Belgium
---
The CD of most conjures is short enough and fits the rotation very well. Shorter(drastically) CDs would make rotation chaotic + conjures wouldnt be that bursty = useless pretty much. 
---
FGS CD could be a little bit shorter tbh.

This just reminds me of an old post on gw2 forums.

---
Wow, what fantastic talent, gg ez.
---
Pugs rene are pretty useless they only give a Mac and does less dmg than healbrand
---
&gt; The problem with countries like ours: these things can be enabled if ArenaNet would pay for some sort of gambling license
---
Anet could directly sell these items to you. They chose not to because they want to make their money from gambling mechanics and don't want other regions to rise up.
---
This is not the fault from Belgium, the fault lies with greed from Anet.
---
So that is why anyone who wants to can open up their own casino, run their own lottery, brew their own alcohol and cultivate their own tobacco? Damn, I thought all those markets were highly restricted, required licensing, comes with taking on public awareness campaigns (such as marking their brands with why they are bad), comes with severe repercussions if the restrictions of the licensing is not met (such as illegal sales) and are also absolutely illegal to operate unlicensed.

under PvE is a HoM thread
---
Best/fastest way to gain mastery for elite specs? Got HoT a few days back and did a level 80 boost on revenant I had 0 experience on. Seems like I need Herald to do anything, Metabattle shows elite spec builds only(?). Kinda got hooked in the game again, getting another expansion tonight.
---
Thanks in advance my dudes/dudettes
---
Yeah, it is confusing. I'm a programmer myself, and we call ourselves "the dev team" and everyone else by their respective team names; our clients, however, just call all of us "devs," so maybe I'm just used to it by now.
---
&gt; I am doing this to explore the possible consequences of over-regulation to other game aspects, which reflects the concern of the study stated under point 88.:
---
Nobody's talking about over-regulating anything. We're talking sensible legislation here. If it ever gets to the point at which an *over-*regulation might be proposed, then we shut that down. The theoretical possibility of bad legislation is no argument against applying sensible legislation.
---
&gt;However, this is arguably out-of-step with the digital economies in the games industry. Indeed, Brad Enright acknowledged that the definition of ‘money’s worth’ is an area where the Gambling Commission is “constrained […] by the current legislation.” He told us that that a broader definition of value:
---
&gt;would need a change in legislation, but also in doing that you would have to be very careful not to catch lots of other activities, which may also incorporate expenditure, chance and a prize of value or worth to the player.
---
I fully agree with this. We DO need to re-evaluate the meaning of "value" to be functional in an increasingly digital world, and care *does* need to be taken to make sure that it is applied *accurately.*
---
dam oversized shoulders lul
---
Pay full price for a game, no further monetization. That's it, just like it used to be. When I start a 90$ game and see ads for skins and emotes and whatever garbage, it just looks so gross.
---
Give stability with Jalis, rip boons with Mallyx (instability, Siren's Reef, any Dredge, Twilight), also some groups profit from Mallyx during Mai Trin, provide projectile mitigation with Ventari (Snowblind). Shiro is mostly dps but also provides a teleport that allows you to skip across and open a Xera portal, e.g. in Molten Boss.
---
Generally, if there is any mechanic, you should do it and you should provide might, alacrity, protection and then you are a source of retaliation, stability, resistance and so on. And of course major CC. Your elite is both a dps increase and offers sustain, your heal in Kalla reduces incoming condi dmg and brings more sustain, your cc spirit is great to shut down groups of mobs.
---
Reminds me of the amazing Anet stream.
---
Metabattle has a [Generic Open World builds](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World/Soloing) section that usually has builds for all kind of tastes and situation including a [Core Rev](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Revenant_-_Power_Sword) build for you to use until you get an Elite Spec.
---
You unlock Elite Specs just like you unlock your Core traits/skill while levelling up: with Hero Points. You need 250 Hero Points for a full Elite Spec but fear not, HoT and PoF "Hero Challenges" (their equivalent of Core Hero Points) give you 10 Points each. Some are kinda hard/annoying to do solo so you may need a couple of people to do them (you can always ask in map people will usually give you a hand). PoF Hero Challenges are way easier to solo than HoT ones on average so that could be a choice to go do your 1st Elite Spec there. I think that every once in a while you have people organizing HoT and/or PoF Hero Challenge tours to do them all so you could look at for them (during weekend mostly iirc).
---
[Masteries](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery) are completely different topic and are Anet take on "horizontal progression". It's a bunch of Account-wide enhancement to make a map, an expansion or even the whole game more fun and enjoyable (like getting an Autoloot, mouvement speed increase in cities, Glider that can glide forever, mounts that can go faster/higher, etc). For those you will need [Mastery Poins](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery#Mastery_points) (acquired from various activities or found in the Open World) and earn XP on a level 80 character in a specific region of the world (Core, HoT or PoF). Fractals, Raids and Meta-Events (each map will usually have at least 1) are a great way to earn XP.
---
Finally, about you getting HoT a few days ago and planning on getting PoF, Anet recently put in place a permanent deal: if you buy PoF you get HoT for free. So you may want to contact Customer Support to see how you can try to have both expansion without having to pay for both in the end.
---
&gt; I keep getting my mount stuck in the ground when I use it and it’s irritating.
---
It's a bug that has been present in game since PoF release, no plans to fix it, and with 1/3rd of studio gone I doubt they have enough retained code knowledge to do it anyway. If you continue moving (you can track your position on minimap), it will unfuck itself after a while and rubberband you to actual position.
---
\&gt; I think the line hasnt been drawn at all, which is why we are still controversially debating it.
---
 
---
The wording in the article doesn't ever mention a partial reveal of the contents "per roll" to avoid lootbox classification, which is why I don't know why people are misrepresenting it that way. In no other instance I've seen the concept of "revealing the contents of something" to signify anything other than a complete reveal of the contents. You don't reveal half of your tax returns to a judge looking into tax evasion, you don't reveal half your car's trunk to the police looking into a drug dog's alert towards your car. 
---
I do not know where this "controversy" is coming from, especially when they mention it right there on the study: 
---
\&gt;usually the contents of loot boxes are unknown to the player at the point of purchase—***what a player gets for their money is therefore based on chance***
---
Notice the emphasis on chance, and not on partial reveals or expected minumum returns. If anything, the section on "expected value" calls for tighter regulations on the lootbox mecanics, far from using it as an argument that this is not gambling:
---
&gt; These in-game rewards can have value for players—and influence players’ behaviour (i.e., motivate them to engage with loot box mechanisms)—without being converted into real currency. Perhaps more importantly, it ignores the fact that players are demonstrably willing to pay real money for the chance to acquire these items; implying they have a monetary value even in the absence of the ability to convert them back in to currency. 
---
 The whole section on lootboxes speaks about FIFA, a game where you also have a minimum expected return. 
---
And the conclusion to the section: 
---
&gt; We consider loot boxes that can be bought with real-world money and do not reveal their contents in advance to be games of chance played for money’s worth. *The Government should bring forward* *regulations under section 6 of the Gambling Act 2005 in* *the next parliamentary session to specify that loot boxes are* *a game of chance.* ***If it determines not to regulate*** ***loot boxes under the Act at this time, the Government*** ***should produce a paper clearly stating the reasons why it*** ***does not consider loot boxes paid for with real-world*** ***currency to be a game of chance played for money’s worth.*** 
---
Emphasis mine. If that's not a drawn line, I don't know what is. 
---
\&gt;That way, an item worth at least 125 gems is always guaranteed, which equals your money's worth and the other three drops will guarantee that you even get more out of it.
---
Again, this is meaningless in the context of regulating gaming lootboxes, where the developer controls the item to gems objective value market. If "guaranteed value outcome" is placed as a classifier for the lootbox category, all a developer needs to do is implement meaningless, reusable items, slap a big gem value on them and serve them as guaranteed drops in lootboxes to avoid classification. I.E: selling a 500 gems lootbox with 4 unlocks, out of which one is a guaranteed 1 hour exp boost that only works while killing moas that is also sold for 500gems as a standalone gem store purchase, and a 500 long "common" item list of cheap dyes along 5 "rare" drops that players actually want would be an easy, inexpensive way to completely avoid any lootbox regulations under your perceived understanding of the wordings of the study, as it fulfills your "partial reveal" and "guaranteed return". 
---
At this point, I have to ask, have you read the [whole thing?](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1846/184606.htm#footnote-212-backlink) I don't know how anyone reading that can be left with doubts about the spirit of the study, or thinking that they were not explicit enough with these things. They explicitly mention every point you've made about expected returns, revealed contents, and brushes it all away because they ultimately think these things should be tightly regulated, and call for the lack of regulations to be clearly explained.
---
because of course it so obviously is a loot box.
---
Tempest can already cleanse just as much as a Scrapper and with recent buffs this is even more true. But i agree with you about Celestial being a good choice for pug squads. Marauder works too for more hp and more precision.
---
It's cleansing, not converting and they both get nerfed due to antitoxin rune nerf.
---
Why the frigg does the website still sell HoT, sounds dumb. Will try to get the refund. 2 hours?!?!? Few days and still madtery level 11

You got a timestamp on that one?
---
They left because of the piss poor balancing....I should know I was in anvil rock for years. There was no way we would ever beat some servers... we simply did not have the man power.
---
You main task is to upkeep f4 (alacrity, duh) and f2 (might) as much as possible on people, do kalla elite as much as you can (generally on bursts and when people need healing), break cc bars (so you want to at least start with staff and do skill 5 every time breakbar is up) and try to do some dps with all of that. If there is NPNG - that is your main job to remove it with mallyx too.
---
 Plus in 100 cm it is your job to do balls on the second boss (you have by far the lowest dps in the group, plus you can do alacrity/might and  place kalla's elite just before going out, fulfilling most of your purpose anyway), kill anomaly on arkk (same thing, you are the least valuable member dps-wise and a lot of your roles don't require you to stay at stack at all times)  and it won't hurt if you switch shiro for dwarf and do stabitily on every island on the first boss of 100cm.
---
In t4 you should also consider using aoe daze spirit cat on every trash-heavy fight (it disrupts their attacks pretty well), shiro teleports for skips in molten and cliffside (there are probably some videos around, or ask more experienced members on sight), using mallyx even without NPNG present to stip boons (some bosses have their own protection, most prominent example is amala of TO) or pull conditions from the group (might be helpful on volcanic's boss or in every fractal with afflicted), ventari for projectile destruction (valuable on the same volcanic's boss or in chaos fractal), dwarf for stability (like on the gladiator in chaos fractal) and it's elite, which generaly eases pressure on the group (bosses of sleepstone or SR are fine places for that)  All at cost of some dps.  Just don't ever drop kalla and don't neglect you main duties.
---
There was a somewhat related video recently, actually https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxamf1/learn_to_play_alacrigade_2019_build_guide_for/
---
to be fair the last time ele was somewhat meta the ele did not pick up his conjures. The Ele was only there to drop the conjure for the DH.
---
It's nice if you can pick it up but most ele players are used to not get their second conjure anyway
---
"are you even dps greeding if you don't steal the conjure of the ele"  - a filthy dps main
---
If youre heal you constantly swap elites to spam healing skills
---
On power, you camp swords, staff is only for cc
---
Spam f2 and f4.
---
Your tasks are mainly giving alacrity and might, as well as doing certain mechanics, most prominently killing anomalies on arkk (that's sword aas and 4) as well as jumping balls on art.
---
I messaged the mods about that, no response

Anet don't care, even if they did this sort of decision would be up to NCSoft and they definitely don't care.

Sorry if you already know and you’re doing this collection for fun, but in case you don’t, currently it’s way cheaper to directly buy the Kudzu precursor from the TP than going through the collection/crafting steps (169 gold vs 495 gold: https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-30685 )
---
Well gee, I wonder why.
---
The beast gives points therefore it is fighting at point.
---
Don't fight off point is fighting on the bottom of the staircases or in front of spawn. Especially when you have fewer points capped. Do you have all 3 capped and some idiot enemy who you have a chance against wants to 1v1 off point.  By all means go for it, especially if you are somewhat bunky.
---
If they stand in front of your spawn use certain mobility skills to run past them and lure them away. Or invis/invul. If your class can't do that take a different exit, or worst case wait for a teammate to respawn.
---
P.s. why you talk about orbs, that is unranked. Even if you are the worst player and new I advice you to play ranked straight away. Wayyy better rewards for the time and really you have nothing to lose. Just do what you can, if you want to ignore my advice and it is fun for you to fight off point don't let others stop you. Just do it, but do it in ranked.
---
What annoys me most of the time is missing differentiation of lootboxes throughout the industry: Don't get me wrong all those "Open thing to get random thing - buy more thing to open with real money" are lootboxes. 
---
But there is a difference: 
---
1. EA gives you an advantage when buying stuff. (Or stuff exclusively to those boxes to accerlate your progression) Pay2Win IMO [That happens in many other games Cryptic's STO or NWO on are par with EA]
---
2. Then there is stuff like BLCs: Open boxes,get cosmetics and some nice goodies which may help you/makes things easier from time to time. Also have 2 guaranteed drops (which are pretty crappy most of the time) Pay2Fashion [I would consider League of Legends Hextech-Boxes in this category, as they give you skins and champions to unlock]
---
The first 2 Options are kinda dangerous because you kinda need them to progress, or to make stuff easier. [TP2Friend, Vendors, Bank for BLCs] I can understand why those are considered gambling.
---
And then there is the third option:
---
3. Blizzards Overwatch gives you boxes for leveling up. (you can get 1 per 1-3 hour game time approximately) There is pure cosmetics in that boxes nothing else,  and you get them pretty quick. The only thing that can be interpreted negatively is that they are also sold for real money, which makes them gambling.
---
So i would really wish that there is a differentiation. Because some of those boxes are dangerous IMO and need more control, while others are harmless, and maybe need some slight regulation. 
---
Let's be frank here: Lootboxes won't disappear. To forbid a thing entirely makes nothing better, to regulate them in a way, that Developers can still use them to get some additional money, while making sure ill or addicted people won't spend too much money on them should be the goal here. 
---
Tl;dr: Different kinds of lootboxes, not all bad. Regulation instead of prohibition.
---
I think they meant “and they’re also the target audience”.
---
Indeed,
---
Wouldn’t affect GW2 too much considering it’s been on the market for 7 years. But hypothetical successors would be if they maintained it.
---
Effect on the rest of the market would also be fascinating, ie Fifa 20 or Madden 20 being rated 18 at launch. Now that would be interesting to examine.

---
when bar is broken you're supposed to burst the boss
---
It is bad design to hold account bound items exclusively behind this mechanism, as the law in your country now supports. 
---
As someone who refuses to chase an item by gambling - I.e. an unknown potentially very high price tag, it also gets on my nerves that there’s no other way to acquire these items.
---
This kind of practice has to change.

aaaah i see it now. thought they were saying "Also the target audience needs protecting" Thanks!

isn't a principle of any proper written language to read things in a neutral tone?

Who has to learn what?, lmao.

It's impossible to make any changes to a loot box system without it being called predatory.

Other than removing them entirely, can you think of an improvement that people wouldn't call a sly way to manipulate you into buying more?

I'm sorry you had to go through that.
---
I do not make a post often at all and the reason I did so was to see where people stood on the matter. The posts thus far are interesting to read and provide a good amount of discourse.
---
What I would like to say is that having negative experience such as "I once had to put up with 'x' and 'y' and it was so much worse." really shouldn't become the standard for any business or industry. Otherwise it would just become a race to the bottom. Obviously there are things that require more attention than others so things need to be prioritized.
---
Of course games are complex things and there is no 'easy' button. The fix might break something else, which could in fact be the case. 
---
However just saying "It's complicated." Well, that could apply to almost anything. Others have at least mentioned that the patch is on hold to avoid double work as it would just need to be patched twice. Once now, and once more for the patch on the 17th.
---
Thank you all for your help :) Really nice. Hope i can get all of that done :)
---
Even still it would need to be debated in parliament which isn't sitting, then there will be an election in November so no enough time to push through new legislation or an amendment to a current bill. Then there will likely be very little domestic discussion going on. Add in Christmas this would be in 2020. Then you have every stage of getting something through and anyone could defeat it. My point still stands at the latest if this is going to happen it'll be Summer 2020 hell even 2021. Sorry to get too technical but politics is important to me and I like to let people understand why it may take months if no years to get through.
---

I've stopped gathering for the duration. I can't go back to single node gathering. And that Anet goes "lol sux2bu cu in 2 weeks kthx" pisses me off to no end. What the actual fuck.
---
World boss events are a waste of time, you get more drops and amal gems for hot and pof metas
---
Very interesting. Yeah this current situation is annoying, but as you said we can apply the fix to the current code, or we have to write over it again on the 17th. So what makes more sense? Sure the 17th then.
---
It's not game breaking so we should bump it further down the priority list.
---
Have there ever been any patches that strongly affected your gameplay experience before?
---
PG and PG13 are film ratings, so I doubt a game given such a rating would mean a lot ...
---
FYI, https://kotaku.com/how-game-and-movie-ratings-work-112690
---
But yeah, they could add it to ESRB and PEGI as a label, though PEGI has the Gambling label acceptable at PG12 and ESRB has it at Teen, and the more appropriate In-Game Services of ESRB has no such rating limitation. An issue with those issues would really mean taking up the beef with ESRB or PEGI directly.

OH MY GOOOOOODDDD!
---
As someone who works in software development and has to (most of the time) push out patches and fixes whenever I fix them it is really a case by case situation.
---
Some things need to be deployed ASAP (or at least after they were fixed) so that the customer is not in any disadvantage (program is running this way instead of that way) or creates more and more instances in which you would have to fix it manually on a database or something.
---
Having release schedules is great but should only be for new releases, new fractals/raids, new living world etc. Fixes and Patches should always be pushed out as soon as they are ready and tested.
---
However, maybe there is more to it than we know about. For example, the bug could have turned up a problem that goes deeper than just this glyph which would needed to be fixed too but they also would need to work on existing changes before releasing the new living world episode. Which means, you wouldn't really want to roll back your code to that particular time period, implement the fix, push it to the live servers, merge your other changes, test it again and then hope the new stuff doesn't break it again. Instead fix it in the new version and roll it out with the new version.
---
I have it a few times already in the last few years in which we had to wait for an update of the underlying system so that we could deploy our program just because the bug we encountered required changes in the underlying system to work again. In my case this took like a few days but our team is also not that large.
---

Probably a plot point to be used later on. It's likely that something about the mystical method that turned the dwarves into stone also prevented it from being corruptible, which I'm sure we'll be discovering at some point to use against Primordus.
---
&gt; Are you one that purchased or uses the Glyph of Reaping?
---
Yes
---
&gt; How much has this affected you
---
Not much. I just take a little longer to gather more nodes
---
&gt; are you satisfied with the current response from Arenanet on the matter?
---
They saw a bug, disabled the effect so people do not exploit it and have given a time where the bug will (hopefully) be fixed. I don't see a problem with that.
---
So ban kinder surprise, trading card packs, and things like lottery tickets being sold at the supermarket as well?
---
That was my concern. Again this is not a game breaker, but. How does that make your player base feel when the next item up for sale on the store might end up disabled for 'x' amount of time due to an unforeseen issue.
---
This is part of their business model, and we're just gonna turn things on and off because "Please understand."
---
Which will be shortly followed by maintenance mode. 
---
Btw I am not defending loot boxes.
---
Missing the critical "this is why we have to do it" piece there, champ.
---
The free keys are (kind of, usually the tactic is to just drop the boxes that are useless without keys to entice people to buy the keys, which GW2 does), but pity tokens and duplicate rare rolls are meant to decrease the rate of gambling addiction. Its why OWs lootboxes, while bad, are a lot less bad than, say, Valves lootboxes.
---
Pretty much, the discussion tag is a joke. I wonder how many alts called "pleaseleave" that the mods will do nothing about will be created this time around.
---
I would say that majority of patches through my GW2 experience stuff usually got better. If something was broken, it was really just temporary and one could just wait...after all, this is not the game (or genre) that would require me finishing everything at that certain day. We play it for years, what is few days wait in it... :)
---
I remember one time (I think last year) when Living story chapter had to be released at tuesday, but during weekend something nasty basically corrupted many EU instances, and throughout monday the game was quite unplayable. Disconnects, and such.
---
They actually went out and just released major patch like 18 hours early, at monday EU night, wiping out old servers and basically restarting them with new build. Was nice to have early access while everyone was expecting patch to be later the another day, and it certainly fixed the servers. So sometimes going off-schedule is beneficial, but the severity of situation is very big factor if it is worth it or not.
---
Youtube
---
maybe they would start producing real engaging content instead of trash gem store stuff if gambling and micro transactions would stop being such a problem, just make people pay for episodes and real content and watch how the game would grow, but no keep developing gem store shit
---
What bothers me is that i bought the tools with the glyphs from the gem store only because of those glyphs. I am not bummed out about the fact that i payed money for it, they are well worth it and i am also not bummed becuase there was a bug, shit happens you can never control such things and bugs will happen.
---
What did bum me out was when i read how long it would take for them to patch something they already have a fix for. 
---
I belive that i am patience because i did not rage about me paying real money over it nor was i upset about the bug. But seeing they deley the patch because.... why not then, i feel, hey i payed for this. The store is there to support the game and i supported it, why am i put on deley when the fix is there? 
---
This bothers me. Not in a ragy way but it do bother me in a negative way and i feel it could have been avoided.
---
Lots more cursing and calls to uninstall. Then, then I will feel at home.
---
I saved this to my hard drive after seeing it. Love everything about it. The music goes perfectly with the narration.
---
Yeah, I get that. I'm putting off playing again cause my plan is to get all my f2p skills to 50 before going for members. But the only ones left now are Runecrafting and Prayer... ouch.
---
&gt; just make people pay for episodes and real content
---
While I agree with your suggestion completely I don't think this is popular and accepted idea sadly. We would see this subreddit flooded with posts complaining about that.
---
It will most likely be not at all because it would likely be introduced as a private members bill or a 10 minute rule bill and all that has to happen is one MP saying no and it get thrown out. Look at the upskirting 10 minute rule bill or private members bill one MP torpedoed that. Now the government made it government policy but they wouldn't with this. Sadly nothing will likely happen. As for force it on the rest of Europe yeah that would be great people in the UK complaining that Europes forcing stuff on us yet we should do it to them. Also gambling and lootboxes aren't an EU issue its separate countries. Even if it was EU jurisdiction the UK won't be part of the EU. Like I said sorry for getting all technical but its nice people know the facts.
---
&gt;Where do we draw a line and say this is not okay?
---
Actual game breaking stuffs?
---
If the grocery store advertised that you might get milk, or you might get something else, then you got what you paid for. Loot boxes are the same way. You pay to get an item pulled from a pool of items. You get exactly what you pay for. No more, no less.
---
Clearly nobody here ever gave a FGS to their mesmer to speed portals in dungeon runs

Win + G brings up a gaming center that does things like monitoring cpu, capturing clips of your game, among other things I don't use.

Win + Alt + G records the clip.

It's very handy, I'd Google how to get it.

[Devouring the Brand](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Devouring_the_Brand) has you blow up a Branded devourer's nest. The thing is that although they are Branded, they are still laying eggs. So at least Kralk Corruption doesn't inhibit reproduction.
---
My father taught my brother and I a lesson when we were young: we'd go done to the local grocery store and get 5 dollar lotto tickets each week for a month then tabulated up the cost and our winnings.  Despite getting a couple of $2 and $5 wins, we were well in the hole.  Never thought of doing gambling for anything other than " having fun with friends and would be willing to pay this amount for any other entertainment" since.
---
I think 10 or 20 EUR for me to get the scythe skin. Was the first and last time I spent real money since I got shit all for the money I spent.
---
Actually, that is how it works. What youre saying is exactly how it doesnt work. The thing with gambling is that it preys on humans tendency to focus on the extraordinary. The reason gambling is so enticing to some, and so hard to resist, is because you dont care about the average case. You only care about the big win. Whether your 10$ buyin gives you a small consolation price, or nothing, legitimately doesnt matter.
---
So no, it doesnt reduce potential inhibitions because for the people who buy lootboxes, those inhibitions dont exist. No, what it actually does is it creates a cap. An upper limit to how much you will gamble, so that you dont keep rolling the slot machine.
---
&gt; Nobody's talking about over-regulating anything
---
the point 88 of the study does.
---
&gt; We're talking sensible legislation here. If it ever gets to the point at which an over-regulation might be proposed, then we shut that down. 
---
Wrong, the current gambling legislation isnt sensitive to digital economies in the games industry because that legislation was for the most part introduced before digital economies in the gaming industry even existed.
---
&gt; The theoretical possibility of bad legislation is no argument against applying sensible legislation.
---
And I didnt say that new sensible legislation shouldnt be applied, to the contrary, I am mostly in here to find out how this legislation should look like. A big part of that, I think we all agree here, is how  digital value is determined in relation to monetary value.
---
Until that is clearly defined, there is no use to introduce any new rules or legislation to video games containing loot boxes.
---
That sounds worse than it really is.
---
The problems are that programmers are also only human. You can't think of every possible combination of interactions that someone used in your program. And the more complex and larger your code base becomes the more situations you have with those interactions.
---
I have always seen the argument of "well then they have to test more and better", yeah only that it doesn't work that way. Every person does things differently, if you have written some code you already know how it works so you are more inclined to do exactly the test so that it works. That is where the QA comes into play because they don't know how it works and can find bugs that the Devs missed. However, even a few hundred QA testers will not be in any comparison to hundreds of thousands or even millions of players who all have their own approach to something, be on different hardware etc.
---
So it is more like the devs sitting 1m in front of the wall and jam stuff in the holes while the players sit a couple of meters away from the wall and say "but hey you missed one".
---
Any JP with dead drops is lethal if you're not going to use glider, and HoT ones require a glider.
---
I'm going to say that Griffonrook Run is the worst, because it requires you to jump to almost death several times to progress, and if you're not completely healed/on appropriate trait, you're dead.
---
If you're a thief, then you can stealth through mini dungeons, so worst ones would be those with traps that down you, like Zuul.
---
Yes and no. I get your point, and you are right to a degree, but I would argue that it does reduce the barrier of entry for those who are on the fence about buying lootboxes/keys. For someone who is already addicted it doesnt matter obviously, but for someone who is not, it can increase the chance of falling into an addiction.
---
Check GW2RP forums, the fanworks session is chock-full of artists who do commissions of character art in a variety of styles and price ranges.
---
&gt; I'm sure that's why they introduced the Knife Tail Gang Hunting Bond. It's an attempt at adding a layer or two of complexity to the loot box in hope that it will no longer quite fit into the loot box category
---
This sounds so scummy that it would explain why ANET is letting the rest of their game rot so much since 2017.
---
They don't pride us as their playerbase. They want to pray maliciously on our weaknesses, and use Living World as a bait.
---
If ANET truly cared about its players, they would stop fucking around with the predatory practices. Artificial scarcity is one thing concerning more common over the years, but they keep pushing loot boxes with account-bound items, and hit their worst in 2017 during "mount-gate". But they haven't changed because they went back to their scummy shit with the account-bound Starborn Outfit. 
---
ANET can't push its "Most positive playerbase!" bullshit, and "Non-Binary Dragon!" progressive image, while simultaneously trying to fuck their fans with predatory practices.
---
You can't claim to love your players while simultaneously trying to exploit them with loot boxes. There is however a word for someone who claims to love a person while beating them: Abusive.
---
I made the research about the Land Fall Traits, and found every class as one trait that reduces fall damage in Core Specs. So that's a good thing to know. (For Griffonrook Run)
---
Nice that you got it refunded so quickly :)
---

You're right. Others have mentioned bug 'a' and 'b' how they haven't been fixed and have been that way for so long.

Gold player thief main,I  hate the map. The map is beautiful. No problem really with the special system. The problem is that the map is as small as Capricorn (also a map I hate), and there’s so few ways to rotate out of it. As thief, you get no port spots for trying to go from on the main part of the map to one of the 1-are down terrace things, like in mid and in the bottom center of map. Which means that you can sb around ~33% of the map. Using shadowstep as an escape is extremely difficult because you click in 5 different spots that look like they should work and you can’t port to any. And because it’s small, a team can basically control the map with zerging. Think about traveling around niflhel, or temple, or foefire or coliseum, if the enemy team zergs you outrotate and easy when. Not like that in djinn and capricorn. If your team doesn’t have fb + scourge you lose if the other team does
---
Except that it drives thieves insane when they always have to go decap far... And get screamed at for not +1. Or +1 and get screamed at for not decaping. And then get screamed at by both teams.
---
You keep responding because you know your argument is unprovable without data, as if somehow more words will put lipstick on the pig.  
---
And you continue to make up more stuff like somehow obtaining the shards is not easy or cheap.  Have you taken a look at the wiki page on obsidian shards?  My god, man.  Anyone who plays the game in any game mode will be passively getting shards as well as karma (used for buying shards).  This is what happens when you make an argument without data, you get called out.  Really really sad at this point and a clear indicator that you aren't using any reasoning, common sense, or logic at all.

I fully believe adults should be allowed to brew their own alcohol and cultivate their own tobacco.  Now, I don't believe they should be allowed to sell that product to others without FDA regulations (in the US, other countries have their own regulatory bodies).

Items have opportunity cost.  A bank tab is 600 gems, a mule character is 800 gems.  Filling their inventories with junk items that you can easily obtain more of and that have very little practical application is a waste of the gems the inventory space is worth.  At the current exchange rate, your mule character is worth over 300 gold.  Do you really want to use that valuable mule space on junk?  Delete!  Delete!  Delete!

&gt; I have been playing Guild Wars 2 for almost 7 years now. In this time I have completed the map, made a couple legendaries, played the story, and made my character look fabulous. I have considered myself to have hit end game for some time, outside of raids I have played every bit of content to a fairly large extent. When in the end game I look for alternative ways to play the game, one of these things is playing the market. When I started playing games with an auction house it was an almost mystical thing, these so called barons of the markets making unheard of amounts in a day by making a few clicks. After years of playing I have come to deeply understand virtual markets. My gold income in game is almost entirely from trading post flipping as of late
---
Similar story here, also playing since launch and started becoming a big trader a couple of months in. Also played most available content extensively, with the exception of raids and fractals, so I have a deep understanding of most indivudual market in the game economy. 
---
&gt; I want to gauge interest in a stream and or a series of videos teaching how to do stuff like leverage an API, calculate profit, how to actually use the volume numbers, and general Excel usage. I want to teach fellow people how to take any market and leverage it to their advantage. So is this something that interests anyone here? What is my best route to starting something like this up?
---
Throughout the years I (hopefully) taught fellow players about the game economy in various ways, starting out with guides/posts on the old official BLTC subforum, in game with trading guilds, the r/gw2economy sub, which i moderate, its discord or on here. But I never streamed or made video guides.
---
From experience, different social media platforms will be better for the things you want to teach. Written or video guides are great to explain specific topics but written guides are better to collect relevant data and video guides are better in showcasing how the theory looks in practice and players dont need to reed that much.
---
So ideally, you make a video guide on youtube and a written guide on reddit, which you copy/paste into the video description on youtube for quick reference and links.
---
Hopefully, each guide sparks some feedback and discussion, which i prefer to do on reddit because its quite easy to follow discussion and comment threads here. Discord is great as a general communication center, especially VoIP if you rather have live discussions on different topics, to link and collect ressources. Its great for live written discussion as well but harder to follow conversation strings in general chats.
---
Live streams are probably best utilized as "filler" content to show interested people what it actually looks like what you do for hours per day, be it in game or using/created other tools. Just do what you would normally do when logged into gw2 and start commenting it via voice to spark discussion.
---
There is probably more interest in your daily work routine around big updates, like cooking 500 or the 2 rune and sigil updates and the next LW episode.
---
So maybe a week before a big update (or after it was announced) make a first livestream to take stock of what you currently have invested in in anticipation of the update and why. Then you could livestream daily, either every time you play or every night for a set amount of time and you just explain what you are doing and why.
---
At least for me, the couple of days after a big update goes live are very trade intensive, while I also try to rush through the new content to get a good first look on its economic impact. Those are usually the days I make the most profit and I doubt that it will look any different on your end. 
---
Thats why I think that focussing on live streams the days after an update is a good idea and focus on guides/discussion when there is content draught.
---
Most players probably wont watch you live because they will be playing the content themselves but once the rush is over, they can easily relate to your actions once they are rewatching your livestream, so your posted videos will probably reach more views than the livestreams.
---
One thing you will always encounter is the accusation of "market manipulation". I found the best way to counter that is transparency. While doing live streams where people can see what you are doing when you do it is a step into the right direction, some people will still assume you bought into some markets before talking about it on live stream.
---
Using a public API for your account goes a long way in avoiding these arguments, I published full API keys to my account on several occasions in the past for a couple of days/weeks and had AMA discussions running on reddit along the way, which got very good feedback. A public API key also helps other players to see your point of view, they can inspect your account during off hours, not only fishing for snippets during live streams/videos, which always sparks discussion and questions, which is what you want.
---
I guess you already have your own twitch and youtube channel (not sure, if you need youtube, if you have twitch), you should also create your own discord channel and subreddit for discussion and to collect and publish data.
---
Visit the gw2economy sub and discord to find likeminded players that are already involved in the economy and the general subs/channels to find newbies.
---
For starters, I would also suggest to concentrate on one target group, experienced, intermediate or new traders, otherwise you have too much ground to cover.
---
I wish you good luck and let me know if you have any further questions.
---
Exactly
---
All is vain.
---
10-15 mins early. In other cases, there is a chance to get an empty map (and others maps at LFG are full).
---
Rather get the paper bag masks tbh.
---
I like the alacrity effect the way it is.  I often run an alacrity Renegade in WvW, and the pink flame make it easy for me to identify who's getting alacrity.  Like, I can see if players manning siege are getting alacrity as intended, or if other players are hogging the boon.  if others are getting it then I can ask them to back off of the siege.  Too much reduction in the visual effect would make this difficult.
---
&gt; I'm also working on being a jeweler. How do I work that into my perception of the economy?
---
You dont. Crafting barely makes any profit (outside of daily gated crafts) and jeweling is useless in general.
---
Crafting in gw2 doesnt give you anything rare to sell. You can craft the same gear that can drop from mobs or can be found at a specific vendor like dungeons, wvw and similar. Cooking can be useful, but a lot of good food is account bound so you cant get profit from that.
---
Mats work in similar way. More players in end game means cheaper end game materials. That's why people make low level characters and open specific gear bags on those to get low level materials which are worth more than high level materials. 
---
Most popular gold farms involve open world champ/chest farms that drop rare items which can be salvaged into ectoplasm which is used nearly everywhere. On top of that you also get gear bags or specific currency (volatile magic -&gt; more materials) which can also sell for a decent gold.
---
I think I spent $25 or so once on keys probably 4 years ago and never got anything good. Never again.
---
Ah, I see, so the problem are the games that require you to **SAVE** your details just to make a single purchase.
---
Let me check Guild Wars 2 real quick.
---
...
---
Hey, I've got good news for you! Not only does Guild Wars 2 not require you to **S̸̥̱͂A̵̟̚V̶͎̓E̸̢̳̊̔** it, it even allows you to remove billing information if you have! Convenient, huh.
---
REALLY????? I had no idea...
---
as much as people love labeling their opinions as facts
---
Yeah but not the bs xD
---
I'll give the exact same advice I do to open world players wanting to run soldiers or dire gear: play better.  Cele in organized groups is pretty meh.  If you are in a squad with let's say 5 scourges and all are cele your damage spike will be very small compared to 5 scourges running more glassy builds.
---
Now, people say "run cele in PUG groups or less organized ones so you survive better."  That's true in the same way that running soldiers or dire or minstrels makes you survive better in open world content.  It just means you can face tank some more stuff.  I run my Marauders/Zerker/Valkyrie Scourge build in WvW whether with my organized guild group or just with a PUG commander.  I have zero problem surviving but I know how to position myself and know when and where to duck out of the fight.  I usually get top damage or close to it and rarely die unless we get stealthed on and never saw them coming.
---
Playing with cele or very tanky gear just teaches or reinforces bad habbits.  You may die more, initially, when playing a glassy build but you'll learn how to position yourself better and soon you'll be surviving and dealing massive damage.
---
Same as open world, I can solo most HoT hero points in a full glass raid build while others struggle in groups.  Why?  Because I actually know to play the game, know what my skills do and how to use them.  I also know how to dodge attacks and mitigate damage.  GW2 is an active combat game, not a passive one like WoW where your tankiness or survivablity comes mainly from gear.
---
Speculation: based on our limited interactions with Primodious up until now, I believe he is less of a sinister nature than most of the other Elder Dragons. He is certainly more direct and less manipulative. I think that part of Prim's nature is to charge forth onward to given objective, and that his minions being savage creatures instead of sentient beings is based on his headstrong personality. I further reference how he utilized the Zhaitan/Mordremoth magic he absorbed vice Jormag. He just dispersed it amongst his minions without a clear direction or plan. Jormag concentrated that magic into a single greater minion and it took a vast undertaking to bring that minion down.
---
Cambridge business-english definition:
---
"the activity of risking money on the result of something, such as a game or horse race, hoping to make money"
---
No way to make money no gambling. 
---
The fact that the LAW has to be changed across all countries to include lootboxes proves that it currently is NOT defined as gambling. It's not my opinion it's what the definition and the law states.
---
If you are out for a challenge, i'd send you to Morgan's Spiral (yes you read that right, the first one in the caledon dual jp) 
---
BUT : you have to have RPWalk enabled for the entirety of the jp, dodge-jumps are allowed (and required) in addition to your current ruleset.
---
It is quite a fun challenge. I tried it recently to see if it could be done and it is indeed possible albeit quite a bit more difficult.
---
Yeah! Their musics are some of the best that I regularly listen to.
---
There are some other great composers of the same style, but they are really at the top of the charts for me.
---
Sorry, I mistook those. Well you got the idea in right way. Thanks for the talk, have a good day.
---
There is no war on Ba Sing Se.
---
hm ok I can see the synergy with the trait and turtle banner skill 1   
---
but how does the heal gyro work together with the banner?
---
A perfectly reasonable place for the line but sometimes we have game breaking stuff left in place for months or even longer. On the other hand sometimes we get hotfixes for seemingly pointless stuff so it has become a confusing mess.
---
Except this is a post in regards to **all** lootboxes and thus you could have used some common sense and worked out it wasn't  exclusively regarding gw2.
---
You can work and have debit cards from 16 where I live. I had a friend who spent 2k on Runescape gambling because of it.
---
It doesn't matter how they got to make the purchase. 
---
**Can you explain a good reason behind allowing children to gamble on lootboxs?**
---
What's the pro for that, cmon hit me with it.
---
especially when part of the mechanisms are broken ... not sure if they ever got around to fixing them
---
Well, obviously. But you can expect also people that have the spirit watch achivement not being up there either. We work with the numbers we have.
---
the one in Zuul can throw you into lava and depending on where you land any place you can teleport to might still be lava
---
Dont count on it, if the UK decided to go down that road, that would be 2 countries in the EU that have done so, it wont be long before others follow suit, if Anets response is to ban the countries, they are cutting themselves off at the knees, instead of addressing the issue at hand, 
---
Imagine if all of the EU decided to follow Belgium, do you really think Anet is just going to say, ok BAN all of the EU from buy keys, and problem solved, not a chance in hell that would happen, 
---
Anet would be better to address this problem now, and figure a way out to allow them players to get keys again, instead of burying their head in the sand and pretending this problem will go away.
---
Not interested in discussing semantics. I'll shutdown -P now the discussion as this is going nowhere and I know for a fact I'm right.
---
You *just* explained why it's a loot box while trying to explain why it isn't.
---
You can just slide down the right side(maybe the left too). The initial jump will take a big chunk of your health but you can just rest on the stalagmite for a bit to wait for your health to regen before continuing.
---
Loot boxes are PURE RnG, here you know what it's inside.
---
they got a texture update
---
The banner change was horrible, and we should look to replicate it.
---
Conjure weapons are specifically designed to allow the elementalist to give weapons to their team. That's why they spawn an extra one when cast. There's also a trait that gives you a fire aura when an ally picks one up.
---
God bless whoever suggested to switch opens mid jump in those dumb cogs at the top to drop the speed and not plummet to my death.
---
Nope, they neutered banners back in March. 
---
Hope you weren't too attached to those 20~ish skills that they just completely ripped from the game. :)
---
They did, and it probably launches 64 butts pretty well. 
---
I recall the sad and bitter day when they dropped the Classic compatibility layer. I had a lot of older, not really supported games and spotty internet access, so they just vanished. GOG has been great at patching things, but I'm on Windows now and their backwards compatibility isn't perfect, but at least they try.
---
&gt; Hi, I'm sorry, but I thought you might be referring to Guild Wars 2, as we are in the Guild Wars 2 subreddit and you were suddenly beginning to switch the conversation over to computer games that require you to S̴͍̦̔̈́́̚Ḁ̴̣̲̂͛͒V̵͓͎̗͚̂̿͑̒͒̚͝È̷͚͔͓̗͔̇͒̚̚͝͠ your details.
---
No dude, I'm talking about the **topic that was posted** not just Guild wars 2.
---
You cannot say "It's fine to sell cigarettes to under 18s because the good ones won't smoke!" Just because Anet doesn't save your details, doesn't make it any less predatory.
---
&gt;What a coincidence, your friend is also of the age where he can buy lottery cards and scratch cards where I live! Hopefully he got the appropriate counseling for his addiction problems.
---
Yet cannot go to a casino and even so, You can be 11 and gamble on lootboxes.
---
&gt;Not really, but that seems to be the basis for kinder surprise and trading cards.
---
Which I also said "Sure we can regulate them but they're not really causing any problems." so where are you going with this since your kinderegg line is all dried up now?
---
Its disabled and will be fixed on Tuesday with the Prologue release.
---
Ahh Morgan's Spiral brings back memories, my friend brought me there on my first week of playing gw2 and cleared Queensdale with me afterwards.
---
She quit gw2 shortly after *sigh*
---
It has to be disabled because it interfered with home instances and the new cooking things. 
---
A patch is coming through on the 17th.
---
Herald is behind HoT but I think you need an initial 30-40 Hero point to unlock the 1st step.
---
Thanks so much
---
Meh. I look at is as hey this shit is broke and we know we can fix it one way or another by the 19th so lets tell everyone shit will be done by then so we can work onthe fix and possibly explore other options than the one(s) we have in mind to get it done.
---
The community has be saying forever that anets communication sucks (which it does most of the time) but when they gives us a concrete timeline for a fix its getting turned into some kind of conspiracy and some kind of a fuck you to the player base.
---
Thanks
---
People who have 18 pieces of legendary raid armor are probably a lot more hardcore, so more likely to use gw2efficiency.
---
I doubt that the proportions are exactly the same, so I'd take that comparison with a grain of salt.
---
I'm sorry you are so angry, and hopefully you can get your hostility problems all resolved, but I believe I've answered all your questions? Do you need someone to vent? I can try to Google if a service like that exists.
---
I agree that there should be more ingame than the short video we have. But that doesn't change the fact that bringing back LS1 would require the same amount of work as a completely new LS season do. 
---
I personally would like to see a whole new instance that guides us through each LS1 episodes, show us the main plots and tell us the important details. Something like the vision of Orr in the personal story, the replica of the ascension ritual in LS2 and the "remember"-scenes in the domain of the lost. Something more interactive, and more detailed.
---
Thank random elder dragon, I use linux
---
I'm not angry at all but I see you've ran out of anything to say so are resorting to drivel.
---
Bye.
---
Story wise wing 4. Saul's story coming to a close was the stuff of a GW1 fans wet dream.
---
Nostalgia wise wing 5. Dhuum was the only thing in all of guild wars one I remember doing and saying, holy shit that was pretty hard. And wing 5 definitely lived up to that 
---
But the absolute best imo was wing 7. Coming back to adashim was cool, all 3 encounters are fun, and the idea of a power hungry djinn, with access to the power of the entire leyline network is a thought scarier than a vengeful God of death, or an elder dragon could ever be.
---
Hey! Sorry the story sucks so far. I’m guessing you’re still in the personal story.  Season 2 and onward the story is much better.  Season 4 (The most recent season) had an amazing story.
---
&gt; Justin Fassino, PR manager: I think the important thing here, obviously, is that everyone at the studio knows that there’s a demand for an expansion.  
---
Finally....that's something at least....
---
I hate this fucking orb. I won't get sick of mentioning how much I hate it. Stupid orb.
---
Was there anything left to say? I has already answered your question, and you had answered mine.
---
Bye, see you!
---
I’m hoping ranger gets hammer soon
---
&gt; Do we go build new raids for the raid group, or do we pull somebody to go make the old raids easier?
---
:thonk:  Here is you "raids are under developement" thing. They are actively developing a version of escort encounter that could be soloed by Glenna herself.
---
One day without pvp and I miss everything...😢
---
As cynical as I went about this interview, it's actually quite interesting. Yes, everything is on the table, and there is a ton of PR speak. But it also has quite a few insights. Surprisingly interesting.
---
[Coddler's Cove](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Coddler%27s_Cove) continues to be the most challenging core JP for me.  It's small, brief, and simple to discern where you need to go, but those floating platforms suuuuuuuck!  Their round appearance belies an awkwardly shaped surface that your character can actually land on.  And, gauging distance between jumps can be tricky.  To literally add insult to injury, falling will usually kill you every time - at which point you have to wait for a quaggan to waddle over and res you.  It puts me in the frustrate.
---
The interviewer asked really good questions here.
---
As a returning player, can someone define what World Restructuring entails?
---
Because after 18 months they couldn't gather a full team to finish them?
---
gw2 uses too much the pcie bus it will work really badly on GCD beast on 1x or 2x.
---
Unfortunately due to this, not much to do... The only thing you can try as you are on windows 10 is the dx12 wrapper as it's supposed to reduce bandwidth over the bus so might overcome the problem
---
Nah man, it's ded. Let it rest in piece. Grasping at straws isn't helping anyone. They're not working on elite specs and that's that. They may come in later, but for the forseeable future, they're not there.
---
Why exactly does it bother you?
---
Other MMOs i don't see ppl linking shit in general chat to gather attention tbh so probably none?
---
Apart from some super super rare things happening ofc.
---
And then, after untold amounts of episodes later, it doesn't even work.
---
It is basically the upcoming WvW change, where they will get rid of Worlds/Servers and instead have Alliances based on guilds, with the goal of making the matches more even and stable.
---
The wiki has an ENTIRE page dedicated to ascended trinkets and where to get them...
---
That's really easy to fix. While playing, just keep reminding yourself that absolutely nobody cares.
---
Only get the beasts when u don't own mid. Beasts give u the points equally to having mid for a minute I thought?
---
You're welcome. I just had to share this stuff as a lot of it is quite intriguing for lore enthusiasts (and even to folks casually interested in the upcoming story). :)
---
The devs did indeed seed a lot of plots in core and early Living World seasons that can last for years to come depending on how they tackle these subplots in the narrative. It's been a lot of work covering all the "hidden" race/sex/profession/order based dialogue options for these NPCs (being an Order of Whispers agent is particularly intriguing as you realize via the use of code phrases that lots of "innocent" NPCs around the world are actually quite cunning order agents in disguises all along, sometimes even behind enemy lines!) for wiki purposes (a big thanks to everyone who's contributed to the wiki as every contributor has made this Herculean task more manageable), but it's been fun discovering dialogue you can only get if you've chosen a specific combination in character select and during story gameplay.
---
We have seen quite a few of the core's suggested subplots being addressed in the seasons after personal story such as following up on Caudecus's story since Caudecus Manor story mode, featuring Valette Wi whose existence was previously only teased in easily missable dialogue in Rurikton, the White Mantle influence teased in core maps and Silverwastes, or recalling Talon Bladedancer's jotun scroll lore from Hoelbrak for Braham's season 3 plot, to mention a few. Some plots admittedly haven't come to fruition yet (like the suggestion from the Kellach arc in human personal story where the Order of Whispers suggests that there's another heir to the Krytan throne should anything happen to Jennah), but the devs pick and choose which of these subplots fits best into the narrative they're weaving. We'll have to wait and see how many other storylines will be resolved over the years (e.g. the mystery of the blue orb and the pyrite peninsula's orb and why they both ward against dragon minions), but at least devs have a lot to choose from for their narrative purposes.
---
As the Icebrood Saga progresses, I do expect some unique dialogue variants for norn who revere different Spirits, for charr representing any of the three Legions, for humans in Blood Legion content given Bangar's distrust of humans, and for male and female player characters (as far as interaction goes with Flame Legion and Sons of Svanir). It depends on any episode's given budget how in depth they can go with this stuff, though, but I always appreciate even snippets of such dialogue variants which remind us that our character and story choices do have some weight in the world of Tyria. :)
---
I do hope we see some jotun lore addressed as well, and not just the jotun scroll stuff. For all we know, we could even find a forbidden valley full of more advanced, isolated jotun reminiscent of their days of glory, and we could learn more about their study of the stars and how that stuff is related to Elder Dragon rises. Perhaps we'll even discover more lore about the origins of the Eye of the North and if there's any potential link to the enigmatic Seers, for example. It'll be fun to explore what mysteries await us in the Far Shiverpeaks and subsequent zones.
---
I think it looks a bit silly from behind, but when you look at it from the side it looks fine.
---
Have you ever coded something related to a massive network structure?
---
I looked on the wiki but for some reason it wouldn’t tell me which prefixes were available for the star selectable ascended trinkets
---
Nope, if they can't sell the keys then why the hell would they just give them away after some country decides to ban the lootboxes model?  They would just shut them off for that country and find a different way to make money, not start letting you earn them in bunches in game.
---
Basically making it so that the server you choose at account creation isn't what defines what team you play on for WvW. Rather, your WvW allegiance is based on guild alliances and such, and calculated, adjusted, and balanced each [arbitrary time period - I forget if they said something concrete] based on populations to lead to a more even playing field in terms of zerg numbers, as well as matching values and goals (in theory) within each team.
---
&gt; How the heck does it work in gw2?
---
Nothing you craft has any value. In every case, if the crafted item is available on the TP and the materials are available on the TP, the materials will be more valuable than the crafted item.
---
The only purpose for crafting is so you can craft the endgame items that are account-bound and can't be bought/sold on the TP.
---
Its like the main announcement on the 30th where people say Anet didn't even mention WvW or PvP when they were categorically wrong but because nothing new was announced the playerbase has decided to ignore the fact that WvW and PvP was mentioned.
---
I thought all of them did, but Bloodstone Fen and Bitterfrost Frontier are preferred.  BF because you can change the stats if you choose, or BFF because you can get the currency a LOT faster than any other map.
---
Since Harrier is a POF stat, I'm assuming you have that expansion already to get access to the stats?
---
After so many years of empty announcements, what else is there to do?
---
Unless they prove it's in development, it's never happening.
---
A new way to stack these infusions.  Get a bunch of charr together with this infusion and that rock.  Stand in a perfect circle to stackk these infusions.
---
I know that. Would have taken me an hour to get a sketch that refined.
---
Fuck your comment is dishonest. They told us that they were just thinking about the concept for the restructuring those 18 months ago, it was not their main priority right then and there.
---
The article also mentions how some of the swiss tech makes the restructuring easier, because they can use it for that as well.
---
Stat-selectable trinkets from living world should all have Harrier's as an option, as long as you own Path of Fire.
---
Amulets are available from Bloodstone Fen, Lake Doric, Draconis Mons, Siren's Landing, and Dragonfall.
---
Rings are available from Bloodstone Fen, Bitterfrost Frontier, Draconis Mons, Sandswept Isles, and Dragonfall.
---
Accessories are available from Ember Bay, Bitterfrost Frontier, Sandswept Isles, and Dragonfall.
---
Almost every map has a backpack, though I think it's worth grabbing one of each of the backpacks from Siren's Landing for the skins. Costs a fair amount of karma and map currency, though the map currency is at least pretty easy to get.
---
Comments from anyone at ArenaNet really mean nothing at this point, it's what they actually do that matters.
---
Easier levels can help more casual players get into those game modes though. Just because you don't ever visit doesn't mean they're useless.
---
Nuke repair self-repair anvils (I know, we all hate gear repair). Make the merchants smith's, let them repair and upgrade gear. Give it a 15/30 minute buff for tuning gear; maybe similar to what you get for volunteering map instance (cooldown to prevent abuse?). Maybe 2% vs a zone mob or small boost to a better mat from kills of X. Micro quests.... Elixir from the blood of 300 skritt.
---
Maybe let them add emblems to armor? Or add a random/rotating buyer premium for trash? Not fixed so it's mapable, but having a chance for a vendor to REALLY need spikes, so he's paying double today? Have to be careful of the economy, but might make them more interesting.
---
Either way, agree the white gear sellers are useless unless you are straight up lvl 0 newb.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_trinket
---
*Small indie developer*
---
All of them if you own both expansions.
---
The fans this, the fans that, the fans the fans the fans.
---
So much talk about "the fans", yet one of the biggest problems the game always had is that they DO NOT listen to the fans.
---
All of them should be available if you have the relevant expansion that added the stat combo. If you own Path of Fire then the stat-selectable trinkets from all of the living world maps should allow you to choose Harrier's.
---
HYPE!
---
I grinded gold for a month straight, planning to try and collect the entire fused weapon set when tickets were first added. I filled two back tabs with junk and tonics, not one ticket.
---
That was my lesson in loot boxes.
---
&gt;The challenge is that the skill disparity between average players and hardcore players is extreme. We’re talking about ten times damage output. 
---
This is ANET's fault for not properly teaching players their game, as well as making it so easy to build the "wrong" set of gear.
---
Why does ANET hand out *RABID* exotics from the personal story? Is that the intended stat set they expect people to use first?
---
In my opinion, the progression should be Berserker's first, and then branch players out from there. As long as Berserker's is the default.
---
I post my raid rotations to guild char every day while fighting bosses
---
Imagine how worthless yours are then.
---
What's a dungeon?
---
I don't know how that's possible... I suck but I feel like you would get more than that just hitting auto attack or random buttons...
---
Wait, what? The dutch banned them, too?
---
"WTF Why are you leaving far?"
---
\&gt; Person expects me to 1v3 people
---
I never understood that to mean an expansion - nor Episode 3.
---
I think it's more along the lines of fun side content (- like the roller beetle races).
---
I would suggest staying away from reddit and just enjoy the game. The ingame community is way more positive and happy than the "community" (which consists of multiple people who quit the game YEARS ago, and are still here shitting on everything about it) on here.
---
If they’re going to make cooking their expansion level content maybe they should have released it with the actual loving story episode? And if there aren’t new mounts then it seems like we’re still getting less this season. Lolz
---
I mean there’s still jeweling but yeah, it definitely feels like they don’t really have a clue what they’re doing this season. And they’ve still not said anything about why people would want to actually do strike missions or what the rewards are for them. Feels like one of those one and done features that will be used as nice or twice and then abandoned once people stop having interest in them.
---
Well, at least I can now say good bye to my GS Revenant dream.
---
I do, just not when i see an interview with obvious PR answers.
---
"the fans, the fans, the fans, all for the fans" "guys, we're listening, we promise!" "The stuff you wanted but we never cared to make? It's on the table, don't worry guys!!" "We're handle millions of lines of code for you guys!!"
---
:/ Come on now. If people can't see how obvious these PR answers are, you guys have issues.
---
There was a time, when if you had your weapon unsheathed, and were not running, just walking, going forward and to the right, norn females would use the animation of walking left. Too bad they fixed that
---
Ding ding ding. Additionally, if you are 1vX, it's always better to fight away from a point, because it increases your odds of survival. If you're distracting several opponents, it gives your team a chance to capture the other points.
---
You can say that about every community. I mean let's not forget about how nice this community is when anet does something they don't like, or a raider comes with a suggestion, or a witch hunt gets started because a warrior in full nomads using rifle/rifle got kicked in a T4 because OF THOSE HORRIBLE elitists. Oh yea that nice community that only accepts themself and what they see as "correct". Yea I totally love that community.
---
....
---
One interview with clear PR/damage control answers and already people are in-love with ANet again.
---
You guys are incredible.
---
It's true, I've seen it with my own eyes, too. In any random open world event, even on bosses that are basically DPS golems, approximately 5-10% have at least 5-digit DPS, while more than 50% do &lt;2k.
---
You don't even need a DPS meter to be able to tell that most people just don't do much DPS. Most bosses with aggro tables select their targets based on personal DPS, so you can often reliably hold aggro just by doing a half-hearted version of a proper DPS rotation while wearing exotic gear.
---
are you even considered a raider if you don't do that?
---
Now I finally understand why some people call the new content short and borring. For me its a nice intresting fight which doesnt drag on, but for them its literally just insta delete with their 10x damage.  
---
  
---
They are brining AK-47s to knife fights.
---
I like how you specified Core Tyria with this question, because if you hadn't then I suspect that most of these responses would be Chalice of Tears.
---
To tell players not to expect them.
---
It's important to not equate forums with ingame people.
---
You can have 2 (or any amount) of unique trinkets in your inventory, just not two equipped at the same time (as you were talking about sets). So you can use 2 rings (see the other comment), a trinket and a backpack from BFF for your dps set (Berserker e.g.)  and another set with harriers stats for your healing set. You just cant equip a bff berserker and a bff harrier trinket at the same time :)

Hi pot, I'm kettle. Have we met?
---
&gt; This is us coming forward and saying ‘we’re not done.’ Because we just spent a bunch of money to show everybody all the cool stuff that’s going on.
---
That's some heavy hitting shit and an actual response to something this subreddit incessantly complained about. It also echoes what that one ex-dev said on twitter about the studio trying to recover from layoffs.
---
I'm gonna go read the entire article now.
---
It's a trophy. Duh.
---
215,688 happily looking over their inventories
---
2,124 posting about the same unidentified junk item
---
But why say it like that? Why not just outright say: "We are currently not planning any future elite specs" especially in this community where people literally takes every single letter apart form everything ArenaNet say and twist and turn it. They gain nothing pushing an announcement of cancelled elite specs into the future. Quite the opposite.
---
I mean of course it is gambling.
---
The only thing really shocking to me is how fast the gaming community turned from gambling being a positive good and a source of fun, into something so awful that the government must ban it under the force of law.
---
anyone who uses a macro is sad
---
I think you're not getting the joke, pal
---
That's is a good beginning.
---
&gt; WE NEED TO BE ACTIVE IN OUR COMMUNICATION WITH THE PLAYERS
---
OK, I want to trust your word, ANet. Can we get back our AMA on Reddit?
---
I just tested this with my Druid in the Special Forces Training Area. The quickness is applied fine when my health drops below 50% and I am in combat. It also worked fine when I stayed in combat, healed up to 100% health and let it drop beneath 50% health again.
---
Are you sure that the internal cooldown on trait (20 seconds) has passed?
---
THIS is the kind of communication the community despreately needs.
---
Yup. Most importantly the .dat file.
---
You can easily copy whole gw2 folder as the game doesn't require installation. The main game file is Gw2.dat
---
At some point they're going to just have to rip off the bandaid and tell people to complete content they'll have to (for lack of a better term) git gud.
---
Not to the level of 10x the damage, but even the assumption that players are in level-appropriate offensive gear of at least rare quality and do nothing but press 1 should be a starting point.
---
something something Klondike bar
---
It's not so much about "teaching players" but rather how the combat mechancis are organized. A build being able to deal 10x more damage than a different one, or just a "rotation" dealing 10x more damage, is kind of an issue with how the combat has developed over the years.    
---
Imagine you teach players all the meta builds and how to play them, it would be quickly apparent that most skills and traits and stat combinations ingame are worthless, and the game just shrunk a chunk.    
---
Even if we consider stats that work outside of PvE, there is a clear imbalance in how each stat affects gameplay, yet, the amount of stats given is standarized. People don't run toughness in PvE not just because "you want to kill enemies faster", but because even if you build for tankiness, encounters are designed to just kill you anyways, so players don't really have the choice of trading clear time for ease of play, it's either you kill it on time or you struggle miserably and fail.    
---
We can teach fellow players that what they are doing when they run longbow ranger with bear, and play it safe, that they are wasting their effort, but if the game teaches you that, then what is even the point of having those playstyles available? other than artificial complexity, if from 10 choices 9 are wrong, then you have no choice at all.
---
I, of course, agree with that. I never meant to qualify one better as the other. 
---
I understand that laws cannot make a difference. But i'm still of the opinion that regulation (like force reveal of odds and such) is better than prohibition in general.
---
And all you'd name are minorities. Yes, there are five people bitching at Octovine out of the 50+ that participate. I might actually be one of them, depending on my mood. Doesn't change that as a whole, in general, the community is still in a much better state even after 7+ years than, let's say, BDO. Or ArchAge. Or whatever.
---
Although my experience really doesn't reflect yours. People talking shit in mapchat about how crap Anet is? Sure. Non stop? Yeah...no. But that's an entirely different beast anyway.
---
That just makes the "gambling" part worse, though.
---
For digital goods, you're paying for a random cosmetic or convenience item from a list. That's it, that's the end of the transaction. 
---
For gambling, you're paying for a chance at getting more money than what you put in, which can then be turned around and gambled further. 
---
MtG card packs can be purchased and you can pray that you hit a rare mythic or something which allows you to fund more packs.

My auto attacks are stronger than some players entire skillbar.

Awesome, that will make life so much easier.

Wildstar was supposed to have neighbourhoods, where guilds and other social groups could link their houses together. Sadly, that never really materialized--along with many other things in that game (like half the levelling zones).
---
You can see he's giving 120% for this ungrateful community who, despite his best efforts, still trash talks and kicks him while he's on the ground.
---
It's ridiculous how far he's leaning out the window for you people yet you display nothing but passive-aggressiveness and snarky, sarcastic remarks. 
---
You know, if you weren't so hostile towards ArenaNet as a whole for not being your wish-granting genie, maybe they'd be more open with you but even such a harmless interview sets you people full throttle into snark and bark.
---
Reap what you sow!
---
Damn, now that's some interesting data. I don't know how literal it is but I could see it. I suck at the game but if they forced me to play smarter I know I would definitely get better, instead of facerolling my keyboard like I've done for 7 years.
---
It's enough if you copy the *gw2.dat* file -- it contains all the game files.
---
is not so much about which buttons you press, but rather the % of combat uptime, most of the time people with such low dps is because they spent time running or doing anything but attacking, it's really hard to be below 2k dps with power on your build if you have a good dps uptime. If anything, the safest option or the more friendly option is to build for high burst of damage, so you can then focus on avoiding areas.
---
&gt;if from 10 choices 9 are wrong, then you have no choice at all.
---
Tying attributes to armor was a big mistake ANET should've never done.
---
Yea so since you are agreeing with what I'm saying. I hope you can clearly see that its just plain bullshit to say that gw2 is "omg the best and friendliest community EVAR".
---
Mike Z coming in with an entire massive wall of empty words.
---
Most states and countries that 'ban gambling' also run their own numbers game.  You are welcome to lose as much money as you like gambling, as long as it is the state monopoly who profits from it.
---
Anti-fraud protections?  All for it.  I am unaware of any group lobbying for anti-fraud protections on online gambling; if you are point me in their direction.
---
That's so subjective
---
Imagine scenario where you get free gems in game, 2400 to be exact, never used them before; what would you buy?
---
Do they, though? Do we protect adults from their addictions in the real world? 
---
Do we hide scratchcards and lottery tickets, or do we sell them out in the open in every supermarket and convenience store?
---
Do we keep alcohol in secret menus that you have to ask for when you go to restaurants, or do we put the drink menu front and center and the waiter's first question when you sit down is "anything to drink?"
---
Do we limit the appeal of fast food and junk food packaging, advertisements, mascots, promotions, and locations in our supermarkets and along our roads? Or do we plaster those things everywhere, to the point that if you haven't seen a single advertisement for junk food today, you probably haven't left the house or turned on the TV yet. 
---
The only times I can say that we take steps as a society to limit addictions are a) when they are **explicitly** shown to be a public health crisis, like smoking, b) when we need a whipping boy to either distract attention from something else or prop up other industries, like what's going on with vaping right now, or c) when the government is limiting it just enough that they can more easily tax it in centralized locations. 
---
So, given all that, by what logic can you say that gambling addicts **need** protections? We're talking about adults here, not children. Children have their parents to limit their behavior, they don't need a government when all purchasing decisions are going to go through their parents' credit card anyway, which they can completely control. Video game gambling addiction is possibly the easiest addiction possible to fight. Just....don't buy the game. That's it. You'll never be exposed to it again, unlike every other example I listed. No one is going to advertise a lootbox in the local 7/11. You're not going to get sucked into thinking "just one more Key" in the checkout line at Shop Rite. 
---
So why are we turning to government to fix this issue?
---
I know that you are defending  Anet as hard as you can but if they are basicly telling you "we haven't even thought about doing elite specs" then they are far, far, FAR from even announcing it in the next months.
---
It is an overlay kind of addon with which you can hide elements of the UI (like dailies, events, living story etc). It comes with its own gw2 launcher, but by using this launcher d912pxy doesn't seem to work (I noticed because MSI afterburner shows dx9 instead of dx12 ingame).

Troll's Revenge best JP in-game... sadly they destroyed it with gliding/mounts... wished gliding/mounts were not available in LA. :(
---
Once you've finished the cooking collection (or maybe once you've unlocked the garden plot) any character of your account can retrieve the new seeds from the herb nordes.
---
Uh...
---
Yeah. Okay. Sure.
---
To be fair, I think if they put dps checks, and aim at around 15k dps per damage dealer, or the equivalent translated to overall team dps, it could be pretty good, because that number is not really hard to get, and if you are a hardcore raider you probably double it, so you can even do the content with half of the people and clear it faster. Convenience for the hardcore, and a good stepping stone for the ones that want to get into more difficult content.    
---
Said that, most of the difficulty of raids resides in organization, coordination and understanding of the encounter mechanics. Above all, coordination is the most frustrating one to fail at. And it's probably the one responsible for the toxicity and elitist mentallity surrounding that mode. Is not like most raiders want to be mean to other players, is just people trying to avoid failing at coordination, which really sucks and makes the game unfun (makes players feel that they fail because of something they didn't have control over)
---
I know but I *hate* PoF content, honestly =(. HoT if not so annoying and I'm doing it from time to time.
---
I always stuck by full zerkers. You play like a less mobile weaver.
---
Amala was well reused asset for example. Story mode, open world, fractal. Each part was something a bit different, told some different part of story as well. Yet it was all the similar boss, just tailored for that certain part of the game.
---
this
---
&gt; But why say it like that? Why not just outright say: "We are currently not planning any future elite specs" 
---
When was the last time Anet directly said: "No, we won't do that"? It's better for the game to keep players hoping.
---
I just want different forms that do the same thing... Maybe have them be slots you can fill on a hero panel? I'd love to ride a dolyak instead of a raptor for cold areas but it doesn't need to be it's own mount.
---
It's supposed to be a tool that's meant to expose lazy and idiotic people playing the game.
---
It's a secret project ANet has been working on to hard expose people.
---
I think it's working pretty well, but could use a tweak here and there.
---
Play weaver.
---
The only guys who don't talk about fans like that are devs who go Epic store exclusive, as those usually talk in a way that they don't need fans anymore.

Build + guide: https://youtu.be/YVdg0eV_Kfg
---
Hahaha I’m all set. Thank you for the offer though!! Oddly enough, I kinda enjoy the JP now...
---
I don't keep up with online gambling stuff, which I know is another issue with failure to regulate. I'm just referring to existing laws around casinos and slot machines, etc. There were issues in the past with slot machines that were built to lose, casinos employing card counters, lots of issues of fraud. The casinos only countered by ramping the odds to astronomical levels. Slot machines now have five rows up and across, black jack is now played with as many as five decks shuffled together. The ability for an addict to blow their money never changed.
---
The actual laws boil down to "don't cheat the players" and "don't let kids play." If applied to lootboxes, the ONLY damage to game companies would be the rating on the box. They would still have to willingly choose to remove lootboxes, if they want that teen rating back.
---
Did this the only day for skyscale, thankfully it was me and 3 other mesmers so I scored a port when one of us made it. Ironically it's the fact that gliding isn't disabled that kept messing me up, I'd accidentally open my glider and overshoot the jumps :/
---
&gt;And MTG doesn't fall under gambling laws because you still get value from the pack, even if it wasn't what you wanted.
---
What's value? You still get value from every BL chest. You just don't get what you want. If the "winnings" have value, how are you going to legislate that the "losing" chests aren't giving value? If the "winning" and "losing" chests are both equally worthless, than by what logic are they saying that you're gambling? Aren't you just spending money on the same product both times?
---
Are you saying that, because MtG cards be sold for at least a tiny amount of money at the very worst, that they're not technically gambling?
---
Great. ANet will give you a guaranteed 5 gems in all BL Chests. Guaranteed value. 
---
The gaming companies will not have a difficult time side stepping these regulations.
---
They are weirdly proud of that and I don't understand why.
---
A couple take aways/oofs for me:  
---
- *Cooking 500 and build templates labeled as "expansion level content"*...oof.  
---
- *Conquest staying as the main mode*...oof.  
---
- *4th team working on something.*  This has potential.  Could literally be anything but it gives me hope for an expansion, seeing that its dedicating an entire LS content team to something.  
---
- *nothing to discuss today on mounts and elite specs.*  In another thread I asked the question of the possibility that we won't get elite specs anymore, due to dev time needed on them + adding more complicated balance issues.  This comment while saying they aren't ruling it out, makes me feel more and more like elite specs are on the back burner for now.  It wouldn't surprise me one bit if we didn't get any for the entire LS...which sucks.  
---
- *re-use assets more* Thank f*ck lol.  This is great news, especially with the example of pulling a living story boss fight into a fractal.  That should be a stance going forward on most everything.  Pull out the boss fights, fractalize them, slap on some rewards and boom more endgame content.  I'm 110% for this.
---
Well, the build templates, if they work well, for me are expansion level content. They will have a fundamental impact on how people play the game, what with no longer needing 100 separate characters to have different builds on. It could mean that you could swap the look of your character with a push of a button. If it works that way, that is a big feature.
---
And conquest staying the main mode isn't really that surprising, they tried with stronghold and people just don't play it. I don't know if more modes would really change things for the better.
---
As for the 4th team working on an expansion I wouldn't hold my hopes high :p They say they don't rule it out which for me is 100% "not working on it now but we don't want to anger people by saying we will never do it" kind of thing.
---
Do we really need more mounts though? I fully agree about elite specs, they are a meaningful addition to the game, but when it comes to mounts I feel like we have enough already and if there were to be more we would get into really gimmicky territory with them needing to be at least somewhat unique.
---
As for the assets, 100% agree, though I would love if they would actually work on some map graphic aspects as well. An expansion usually comes with many new assets that refresh the game and it is what I am missing a lot with the LS releases.
---
15k is easy when you buff yourself with might and fury.
---
&gt; Conquest staying as the main mode...oof
---
Remember [Stronghold](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stronghold)? I just had to check the wiki to even remember what it was called.
---
that's a good number too
---
&gt;It's probably an unpopular opinion
---
of course it is, it's just you doing arbitrary numbers to justify what you think is bad design.
---
But it isn't, at least to me, damage scales with mastery of a class and that's perfectly fine.
---
“expansions worth of content” is giving me flashbacks to when they implemented server guesting and removed culling from WvW. You can’t just label any feature you add as “expansion worthy”.
---
Lol I put orb because bell on Capricorn is an absolute must while spirit orb is much more situational. Like if the enemy has all 3 points and we’re all dying off point trying to get the spirit orb, sure, let them have the damn orb. With bell it stacks—it starts at 25 points, then 50, then 75, etc until someone wins. That’s why bell &gt; spirit orb.
---
&gt; Children have their parents to limit their behavior
---
You could say this about cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, and gambling. Lootboxes are gambling. Therefore protections that apply to gambling should apply to lootboxes as well.
---
&gt; Video game gambling addiction is possibly the easiest addiction possible to fight. Just....don't buy the game.
---
Pretty ignorant to say, when the vast majority of free-to-play games are funded by lootboxes. Even GW2 is free to play.
---
So I'm in this weird position where I agree with what you've written here, but I don't understand how you went from saying that MtG cards aren't gambling to seemingly justifying that statement by saying that all physical goods depreciate in value.
---
MtG cards don't depreciate in value like a car. Assuming a static meta for a second, they always would have the same value. It's just you don't know what the value of the pack is before you open it. It's not like a refrigerator depreciating in value when you get it home at all. It's like you buying a box with a random refrigerator in it for $1500, and having a small chance of getting a $3000 refrigerator, but more likely you're going to get a $500 one. Are you going to tell me that that's not gambling?
---
Or if you were playing craps, and instead of losing everything if you miss, you get 1/10 of your bet back. Is that not gambling now, because you never fully bust but always get "something" of value?
---
Idk, I'm pretty sure I'm with you on 99% of this and I'm just confused by the trajectory of this conversation.
---
You've been drafted into a shovel ready job.
---
&gt;Weaver is not more fun guardian, it's boring elementalist...  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Subjective, but I want a new ele spec since I still much prefer tempest.
---
Yep. Doesn't show in the appstore at all. There are a few Dutch articles as well. We did get the shit Rumble Rush tho...
---
When the main cause of concern is "lack of communication", it's not surprising that a bit of communication helps resolve it.
---
What’s wrong with conquest being main PvP mode?
---
Yes  that's how PR speak works. He didn't say anything,  if you look at his statement it makes no promises, it says literally nothing. But the implied statement behind it is we hear you and we are working on it. That's how PR speak works and you can see how people are responding too it in this thread being relieved that expansions are on the table still. He didn't say that, he just used expansion in a sentence with half the common phrase we hear you and we are working on it and people's minds do the rest.
---
They literally say "We have no current plans to X" within the article. The fact that they didn't use that same language to talk about elite specs is meaningful.
---
yrou shinign amror deosnt leme tpye porperly
---
&gt; You could say this about cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, and gambling. Lootboxes are gambling. Therefore protections that apply to gambling should apply to lootboxes as well.
---
And yet we make exceptions for games and other things for children, all the time. Magic/Pokemon/Yu-Gi-Oh cards are just as much gambling for value as lootboxes, they can be purchased with cash so kids are more likely to be able to impulse buy them, and they can even be resold so a kid could conceivably get addicted to the idea that there is a mythic rare in the next pack that will pay for the last 10 junk packs they bought. 
---
&gt; Pretty ignorant to say, when the vast majority of free-to-play games are funded by lootboxes. Even GW2 is free to play.
---
Replace "don't buy" with "don't download", if you wish. Either way, you have to make a conscious choice to play a game that has lootboxes. If you know you have so much of a problem that you can't help but spend thousands on a game, even if you don't want to....well, for every other addiction, we'd tell that person to get help and to do everything they needed to do to remove that influence from their life. You cannot tell me that it's harder to avoid lootbox containing video games than it is to avoid alcohol or fast food, you just can't.
---
Accountancy Waypoint is the poor man's lounge. A rotating cog amasses no sporophyte.

It's called swimming

bitterfrost and dragonfall can get you all trinkets and all stat selectable
---
Exactly. No *current* plans. Different meaning than "No.".
---
It's pretty good, even in 2019. You can just download and play all content up to the expansions for free. Then, if you liked the game up to that point, buying the Path of Fire expansion will also give you the Heart of Thorns expansion for free as well. So for ~30$ you get all elite specs etc.
---
Give it a try! It's free and a really well designed game.
---
Well to be fair my main gripe would be with them saying "look at all the cool stuff", when there's not actually all that much stuff, and it ain't all that cool either.
---
That's not to say I mind them throwing a party about it, but I would have expected a meet&amp;greet then, a dinner evening, maybe even an open panel. But not a stage show like a PS5-announcement or iPhone announcement.

I *really* hope they don't do Story raids and take a hint from Strikes and give us scalable raids. Story mode is nice in theory but it returns us to the problem he said "Is it worth the dev time" and I don't think it is. Story mode would be a one and done type of thing. If they create a scalable system that opens up all raid content to a much larger audience. 
---
To take it a step further, I think the game could benefit a ton from having queues for a lot of stuff. One thing I always miss from WoW is queue systems. It creates a ease of use that a lot of players rely on. Having Scalable/easier raids that you could just queue into(just like Strikes) would go a long way for having that content be played more than once.
---
The base game now comes with HoT already unlocked!
---
I think you'll find that its very new-friendly and still populated! Being new, you'll just be able to experience tons of content fresh right away as opposed to those who have already caught up.

Once you've done the charr/sylvari collections, meat/seeds will have the same drop chance on all of your chars.

misleading reply, if you want all expansion conent you also have to buy the living stories
---
Ok, so it sounds like the ability to re-sell something actually is intrinsic to making it **not** gambling by this definition. Which sounds bonkers to me, but ok, I think I understand now.
---
Does the definition require it to be a physical object? And are these laws state or federal for the US?
---
So by this definition, selling a container with a hidden Beanie Baby or something else collectible with a variable value that may go up or down is not gambling, right? Even if most of the containers hold ridiculously cheap, worthless Beanie Babies, because at the end of the purchase you're still in the possession of a "collectible" which **may** appreciate in value at some point in the future?
---
So, legalities being what they are, I can pretty easily see a couple ways that EA and other publishers can get around any potential gambling law and slide into this "collectible" category instead.
---
Wait, should we yell at cooking 500 also? I didn't follow the matter tbh
---
The core problem is
---
&gt; nowadays people rather rage quit than learn
---
So you can't just put things that oneshot u in open world. If you're not forced to use your brain you wont. In Path of Exile if you dont take care of your gear, if you wont care about HP and resists you wont get past act 6 (there're 10 "introductory" acts). You wont be able to do so because in last boss in act 5 (and later on in act 10) permanently lowers all of your resistances by 30% and it hurts alot.
---
It’s a pretty good article but ultimately I still didn’t really learn anything new from it.
---
Over 9999 iq
---
You can read the thread and see people talking about how that statement means expansions are on the table, being worked on or that that statement means something. I'm not spinning the statement I was telling someone who said the statement meant something that it didn't mean anything. You don't seem to be very familiar with what PR speak is or how corporations in general or gaming Pr specifically use vague phrasing to imply things without saying them. I wouldn't have mentioned expansions at all if I wasn't going to say anything about them but there is a reason I don't do sales or PR and only send out internal emails. What exactly do you think the point of a PR manager is?
---
Who actually walks when they don't want to?
---
Auto-run or mounts.
---
Am I missing something here??
---
This. This is what I think everyone whines about wanting new PvP modes. No, you fucking don't! You just want a shiny new toy you can play for a few days and then put down again. That's why it's perfect as some mini-season thing. Shitty idea off the top of my head: In the off-season, you earn triple reward track progress in Stronghold maps. OMG guys, what's this new game mode? Same for 2v2's, deathmatch, yadda yadda yadda. Put it in the off-season, give it crazy rewards, and you'll have people flocking to it. And guess what? Some of those people will get really invested in it and stick around once the season starts again.

I would hope they can get Build Templates out by the 17th
---
Road work ahead
---
Im pretty toxic, but most players are kinda nice
---
Under Construction.  Coming Soon (™)
---
in Black Lion Chests
---
You found a photo of a real life image in your character’s inventory? This is getting meta.
---
Yeah, I sure hope it does.
---
That sticky would be perpetually under construction.
---
Red pilled

*"I know I'll miss her, a tomato ate my sister!"*
---
Weaver can be challenging to learn, but it's super fun once you get the hang of it!  You're still squishy though, so playing in melee range is tough sometimes.
---
Elite spec fragment, random drop from BLChests, after assembling a whole Elite spec stone then you get a random elite spec.
---
Stupid sexy charr!  &lt;3
---
There is no game that will offer you more for 30 dollars (or even less) dollars.
---
 be a different fucking story if they were getting a cut though wouldn't it like they do with other forms of gambling
---
Well never happened to me so far, since I‘m usually more on the noob side, not the carry :D (Ok, I guess for regular Fracs it's ok, just not CMs)
---
CMs or Raids are usually only Guild Members (and People from another Guild we've befriended), so the LI/LD/KP is not really that necessary :)
---
Hmm, I tried out tempest for some safer open-worlding, but I ended up with arcane fa weaver, since it seemed way more fun to play to me. I just loved the fluidity of the sword, and extremely strong burst damage.
---
There's a couple gaps in the current mounts. I could see a snowboarding style mount (downhill fast acceleration) or an underwater mount.
---
POF is needed for mounts, elite specs and masteries. The classes are fairly balanced, but some are superior others. That being said you can play what you want with the right build via snowcrows/discretize. Unless you never leave open world pve then metabattle works. 
---
I highly recommend joining a high quality guild to get you up to speed. If you want I can direct you to one.
---
If they made a whole zone from the giant trees in Bitterfrost Frontier so we could soar between the giant trunks on our griffons, I would be so happy.
---
It's pretty transparent. They aren't working on an expansion right now. That's incredibly clear. They know people want an expansion, but want to see how well the Saga structure works. If Sagas don't satisfy people, then they'll think about doing another expansion.
---
I just returned to GW2 after a long break and I'm having a lot of fun. The game is well populated.
---
The gameplay is infinitely worse than GW1 though, please don't set your expectations too high.
---
&gt;Do i need PoF?
---
If you want to play PoF content. This includes the PoF maps and masteries, elite specs, all of season 4, and the upcoming season 5
---
&gt;Does the gear from base and hot still good?
---
&gt;How's the class balance? Love engs but they sucked
---
Same as always, some choices are more meta than others, which really is impossible to avoid.
---
Engineers have gotten some...interesting changes, which put them pretty solidly at a mid line in both PvE and PvP scenarios. Condition engineer is in a good spot in PvE, albeit not easy, and there is a heal scrapper build that isnt terrible in PvP, although I'm not totally sure if it's considered good right now (if someone could clarify on this point that would be great)
---
At most it’ll take you a year or two to catch up. Depending if you want to do competitive content or not. I only played core and I caught up in 6 mo to a year. It’s pretty easy get through most of the content in this game.
---
I picked up GW1, that's enough GW2 classic for me (actually almost a little too classic, but it does help bridge the time until tuesday).
---
To get your own gear.
---
What do you want them to say? They can't say how they are going to do stuff they haven't started working on yet.
---
They are not planning to start work on an expansion at this time.
---
I really don't understand the delay on swiss and alliances
---
They are just population sorting algorithms right???
---
What kinda of spaghetti-fied swamp of coding is holding these things back?  Two years of even one person developing either of these seems like some serious issue
---
Yeah that's what I meant, I'd prefer the same mount function with different skeletons. And then skins for those skeletons too why not. It'd solve the problem of wanting more mount variety but pls no more mounts functions
---
It sounds like their goal isn't difficulty tiers on individual strikes, but rather having different strikes of different difficulty.
---
this hardly counts as communication
---
Just got out of WvW , at 118 ping there was 10 secs skill delay .
---
Amazing .
---
if you look closely, you see that i wrote "all expansion content"
---
but the morons here only downvote actually useful information and upvote trash tier fanart, i always forget that
---
*yawn* you start to bore me.
---
I've always found the Hearts the worst part , if this was my map complations I would be very happy .
---
That's probably more in the vein of bringing back content they basically deleted, rather than re-using assets that are actually live in the game. Of course we could all want both, but I would suppose there's less work in making the Balthazar fight an ongoing rewarding 5-man encounter than to re-introduce twisted marionette when that code is probably in shambles now.
---
What I’ve been told is that the base code for GW2 was written by people who left Anet years and years ago (and also parts of it cut and paste from GW1 apparently?!) and the current devs still don’t understand it.
---
&gt;  i'm beginning to think GW2 has spoiled MMOs for me.
---
This is a large reason a lot of people are playing Classic, they dislike the feeling of being spoiled. But I guess everyone likes their own flavor, imo Classic has a better combat system. I really dislike weapon swapping as a mechanical limit on the spells and abilities you're able to use at a time.
---
Thank you, really love Cond eng have to check those changes
---
Then when? In one year? After Saga trash? That means 3 more years without an expansion. This is the best time to start working on an expansion so they can release it after the s5.
---
I seems that MZ kinda forgot that WvW exists. 
---
Still a wall of empty words.
---
whats Swiss?
---
&gt; -They want to re-use their assets more. For ex: having the kralk fight as a one and done story instance they feel was a waste when they could have made it into a fractal too.
---
Are they serious right now? There are so many story instances that would be good as fractals and they just now realized they could be  tuned for 5man content?
---
Balthazar, Joko, Kralk to name the most obvious ones.
---
this and build templates is all you will get aside from story until 2021 yes
---
Its not a char its an asura.
---
&gt;  swiss tournament
---
is this for WvW?
---
Big yikes. Think you took his comment in the opposite way it was meant....saying that wow classic combat even holds a candle to GW2 is pretty laughable IMO
---
we could use underwater mount, and taxi mount so I can give a ride to f2p noobs
---
I went back to GW1. It does a lot things better than even GW2. In particular, the character animations have so much.. PERSONALITY! 
---
Different professions have different run animations, different ways of using weapons, different ways of swinging weapons, etc...   For example, a Ritualist (Gw1 Revenant) bends themselves and closes their eyes as they swing a sword, making themselves look like a possessed puppet. Meanwhile, Assassins (Gw1 Thief) run like a frigging Ninja, and hop around with acrobatics as they assault foes.
---
Each class also has their own distinct armor sets as well.
---
Humans have their different cultures instead of being sanitized fictional races of plant people. It's hard to explain but the tone makes the world feel very immersive and real, compared to GW2 being more cartoony.
---
Areas actually have challenging encounters, so you actually feel moments of tension during important story beats.
---
Skill synergy is important, position in battle, coordinating team builds, etc...
---
GW1 is awesome!
---
Then I looked at WoW Classic on youtube... Lmfao, I heard circus music in my mind. I just saw some dank Tauren walking around a flat field 1v1ing some Moa birds or whatever, and it had one of the worst charge animations I've ever seen, lmfao!
---
GW1 aged like fine wine, and I love every moment of it.
---
no you need to read more into it. There wont be any more expansion but they dont want so scare people away with confirming this. But thats now a problem as they confirmed elite specs can come with seasons, but not this one, so maybe in season 6 in 2021
---
I see a man pulling on a cow's tail that's laying down.
---
Install arc and run it doing a world boss, you'll see.
---
So if that project is not a raid/fractal, noone is working on them at the moment. Great...
---
No peoblem, I'll see you then.
---
Copper fed, bank upgrade (a few of them), material storage upgrade (one), inventory slot upgrade (a few on each character you play often), character slots if you dont have enough. There's an account headstart upgrade (called something like that) which provides a few of these upgrades on a discount the first time you buy it, get that first. 
---
Then you can think about VIP passes, unbreakable gathering tools, shared inventory slots, silver fed salvage kit (although mystic one is sufficient) as well as skins and other stuff.
---
They go through hot periods and cold periods. Sometimes they communicate a lot and things are good. Sometimes they shut up for 6 months and just leave the community stewing in its own dissatisfaction.
---
They need to work on not having the cold periods.
---
We have special events now, so why don't you throw in season one there? Running a few chapters at the time as a holographic thing or mist thing or what ever and let us go through it again but as a look back, memory fragment i mean there are already so many of those things, throw in season 1 in to one of those memory things and let all the players play it through again.
---
No, that's for spvp.
---
It's less "just realized it now" and more "when you're on the treadmill you're not really looking back and taking time to think everything through", if I had to guess.
---
Same here. I get free months for WoW quite often, but GW2 has enough boars already for me.
---
&gt;**MZ:** Our goal actually was for the Swiss tournament beta to already have happened. We discovered that some of the back end infrastructure would have just crashed on live servers. For Swiss tournaments, the front end is done, and we’re just shoring up the back end to make sure that it’s going to run and people aren’t going to lose progress. The work that we’re doing right now is going to have some impact on how we finish world restructuring as well. We’re killing two birds with one stone.  
---
&gt;World restructuring is the paramount feature that the competitive team is working on right now. We knew we needed to get Swiss done, and now all hands are trying to get world restructuring done as soon as we can.
---
They addressed it somewhat here: They ran into a Back End Infrastructure issue that impacted the Swiss Tournament release and would've impacted World Restructuring if it wasn't address. That created one delay, the other being that some of the team was finishing Swiss Tourney stuff first and have now started going full swing on the WvW stuff. Please note that their (very few) updates on the WvW restructuring have said it would be a big, complicated project. As such, delays like the back end thing should be expected.
---
Where I'm at, we had a similar platform change and announced it to our customers three years before we actually started the migration. Kept running into back end issues that *had to be addressed* or everything would crash when started. Big changes like this take a lot of time and sometimes there is a choice made to not update the customer so they can focus on getting the work done. Stopping for updates means taking X number of people from the team and having them give a detailed update. To compound things, any kind of meeting the team has is compounded by the amount of team members in a meeting/update/etc. So if a team schedules a 1 hour meeting twice a week for updates and that team is 10 people in size, you don't lose 1 hours worth of work, you lose 10 hours worth of work time.
---
Please new charr faces.
---
GW2 has spoiled other MMOs for them because GW2's world is insanely polished and cool, not because the player is spoiled.
---
&gt; Magic: The Gathering card packs (both physical and digital) would be illegal by the same logic that called lootboxes gambling.
---
Good. Trading card packs have always been a massive scam.
---
&gt;It's even closer to gambling than lootboxes. Does anyone want to outlaw MtG? How about Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh cards?
---
Not so much outlaw the cards themselves, but I'm definitely against the purchasing method.
---
And then each week there will be a random selection of elite spec traits that you can buy in the gem store to complete your horizontal progression journey.
---
Come on content team 4. Be working on elite specs somehow. Magically. Please.
---
&gt; Areas actually have challenging encounters, so you actually feel moments of tension during important story beats.
---
Rurik, nooooooo!
---
Think what you will about the event but gotta appreciate the craftmanship here.
---
[from the bird!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/963/597/16f.jpg)
---
Having more than a single skill bar is a a big no-no for me.
---
I actually prefer when there's no skill bar at all, and the skills are created with command input, like in fighting games or action adventures like Dark souls, Darksiders, Leggacy of Cain or Devil may cry.   
---
Except for 'party' RPGs like baldur's gate in which you control more than one character at a time.
---
Because that is Mike's other point of too many PvP modes fracturing the community. Nothing is ever going ot have a chance to be a main mode because that just bloats the number of modes in a shrinking community and the community is not shrinking because they only have one game type to play (even though they have 2). They're shrinking because balance comes too slow and no new maps. All of these are problems that the devs can focus on. OR, they can develop new game modes that will see barely any play.
---
From what he said, the main issue is that the updates would overwrite each other (with the temporary, changing nature) and so they don't actually have everything they need to re-implement Season 1 anywhere without a lot of dedicated dev time..... taking away from new LW content. 
---
At least that's what I took away from it.
---
I played it till level 10.. It's too old and requires too much time for me. Missing too much qol (mob tagging, no aoe loot, etc) missing and even part of the graphics looked old (older then current wow). I don't have the nostalgic feeling many people have. I played vanilla in a time when I found it cool but that isn't 2019. Some memories are best kept in the past.
---
take my upvote!
---
Yeah it was all split second so didn't have time to get the gyro out lol thankfully we didn't need to much healing after I knocked off all those people
---
I just want to add that if you want to play GW2 then you have to realise it is not Guild Wars at all, it is very different from the first game. So don't expect it to be GW. A lot of people done that misstake in the past and why i tell you to join the game with new eyes and see some of GW in it but everything is different. 
---
For me i love GW2. I think they done a good job with the game and it is active and engaging but i never expected it to be GW and why i don't have that problem.
---
&gt; I really dislike weapon swapping as a mechanical limit on the spells and abilities you're able to use at a time.
---
but weapon swapping doesn't create that limit.. it actually allows you to raise the number of skills you have access to.
---
if your issue is with the entire concept of limiting the concurrent ability pool.. that's core the game's design philosophy and has nothing to do with weapon swapping.
---
But why compare a game mode in one game, with a game that doesn't have a game mode like it?
---
&gt;We’re taking on bigger projects, to be able to release those when they’re ready, as opposed to holding all back and then doing it as one boxed product. That’s the difference in the methodology.
---
I like getting all the things at once in a boxed expansion :c 
---
Really dislike being drip-fed those features. I loved PoF because of all the bulk of new things at once that I could explore.
---
That's one of the reasons, but not the most important.
---
Why would you ever play a build that is designed for 10 man content in 1 man content?
---
Kralkatorrik gained Zhaitan's magic when Mordremoth (or maybe Zhaitan) died, not when Balthazar died. Yet we don't see death-branded until the very end of PoF, a year after Mordremoth's death (3 after Zhaitan's). So Kralkatorrik didn't gain the ability to use the powers he gained immediately.
---
Grunts and Menders aren't charr though, despite Mith's theory. They're infrequently called Trolls. The S2 Mordrem Trolls (and Wolves) are a confirmed rare case of Mordremoth corrupting animals instead of corrupting and shaping plants into Mordrem (the latter being what the Blighting Trees technically do). So they're all Mordrem Trolls but corrupted in different fashions. One (bee trolls) are animals corrupted into plant monsters, and the others (menders, tenders, and grunts) are plants corrupted into mocking an animal's shape.
---
The thief life
---
Hmm I see your side.  I keep thinking of Overwatch seasons as an example, with it's four different competitive modes and the modes randomly rolling each time you queue up.  But something I hadn't thought about is in OW you can hot swap toons.  In gw2 you would need different builds and classes and comps for each game mode.  Something that would be impossible in the current UI and matchmaking setup.  Would probably be too much work to revamp that whole system to allow for multiple modes given the community is already bare bones anyways.
---
So you would just have ignored the playerbase, and not communicated with them?
---
Griffonbrook Run makes me feel murderous....bastard griffons...
---
GW2 does not require installation.
---
All you need to run it in another computer is the Gw2.exe.   
---
The GW2.exe is a launcher, installer, patcher, repair tool, downloader and game client, all in one. 
---
And if you also copy the Gw2.dat, then you save the time of having to download it all again. The GW2.dat is like a virtual drive with all the game files inside. 
---
Any other files needed will the extracted from the GW2.dat or downloaded, and the game will run. 
---
I recommend a separate folder like D:\Games\Guild Wars 2 rather than the Program Files folder. 
---
You can even have it in a portable drive. 
---
**TL;DR;**  Just copy the GW2.exe and GW2.dat to a folder in the new PC.
---
This is true, the coding is all messed up.
---
RIP Icebow exploits.
---
No intention of going back.  
---
A. The lack of QoL doesn't appeal to me.   
---
B. Either the game can't grow and will get boring super fast, or they squeak out expansions again and piss off the player base all over again.   
---
C. I fully realize it's a trap to convert the former players to subscribe.   
---
D. Subbing to Classic means supporting BfA as well, and F No to that. 
---
As far as what GW2 can learn? That remains to be seen until Classic can sustain after a few months. Right now the explosive success is raw nostalgia, newness, and "I think I want this" rather than advancing good game design or anything that fits GW's core experience.
---
sPVP Holo engi is good
---
I've mentioned this a few other places, but the boxed expansions dropping everything at once both create more strain on developers, more strain on support and "operations" (the back end guys), greater risk of major bugs/breaking changes in the code, and a higher chance that players would be affected by said bugs. Oh, and strained devs/operations people will also have degraded work performance simply due to exhaustion or frustration. This isn't like physical work where you can try and "soldier through it", this is largely mental work, which gets worse the more stress and/or exhaustion one has.
---
Big releases are great for feels and marketing, but that's about it.
---
It's kinda the same shit. With one version, you get all at once but you also do it all just as fast. With the other version, you get it over time but you also do it over time.
---
Neither one is better than the other, just different.  Problem I see here is that people complain about things taking too long to happen but when they do get it all faster then they complain at a lack of things to do. 
---
There's just no pleasing everyone.
---
save bag space
---
What can GW2 learn from Classic WoW?
---
1 thing: give the players what they WANT.
---
For the longest time WoW players asked for Classic WoW servers, and were told "you think you do, but you don't" want them.  Only after years of players hosting unofficial WoW classic servers has Blizzard stepped up and made it an offering.
---
PvE, PvP, WvW, there are lists and lists of things players have asked for over the years, and while giving players everything they want isn't a good strategy, given the steady decline in population, I think ANET needs to realize they need to start giving the players at least some of the things they want.
---
And they are, the problem is the time delay.  Build templates are coming, but those existed in GW1, and GW2 is now 7 years old.  Swiss formats for PvP were promised over a year ago, while WvW alliances were announced about 2 years ago. 
---
Some players are getting fed up and leaving, or at least, minimizing their game play.  I went from playing several hours a day to logging off after doing my dailies, and I consider myself rather reasonable with my expectations.
---
TLDR:  GW2 doesn't need to go back to classic, they just need to give their customers what they are asking for
---
Really, I'm not butt hurt complaining about a feature that's been in the game since day one, wtf are you all going playing the game.
---
&gt; ...what I learned was less applicable to Guild Wars 2 but to myself. I'm experiencing a new world for the first time, and taking things really slow and being immersed. Somehow I lost that in GW2, rushing through hearts and story quests.
---
&gt;...instead of enjoying the griffon journey, I definitely just blitzed through it following a guide.
---
My thought on this is that the old style of quests ie having to move your character to the npc to get the quest then run all the way out to where ever to do the quest and then go back, creates a stronger (maybe not for everyone) connection to the game world being played in. Gw2 you just walk around and events are happening as you are in the area or they are not. Then for the movement you just wp around everywhere so while it makes it very fast and easy to get around the world you (imo) lose some of that connection that older games like classic wow have. 
---
Plus in classic wow a combat takes longer and when you are solo taking on more than one mob at a time is rarely advisable until you have the gear and are "good" at the game. So it again it creates a connection to the world and creates a sense of threat since death is something that will set you back more than a silver for a tp fee.
---
I like alot of changed to game design of the years but I still pine for some aspect of older game design. It is difficult to find a good balance for every game for that kind of thing.
---
[removed]
---
Time gated road block
---
Because if shows what petty assholes you all are and it censors my post.
---
If anything, skills are not limited enough. Huge pool of diverse spells and tight restrictions, like GW1, is the best possible system.
---
I feel the dumbed down boon/condition system GW2 implemented to replace enchantments/hexes from GW1 is the worst thing to happen to the game. But if you allow players skill bars with 15 options, it becomes too hard for everyone to track all the effects.
---
Having Knut be the host of an automated festival makes it unlikely, but not impossible. 
---
It's more likely that a relative of him may die.
---
&gt; Even without the option of getting real cash, lootboxes have an addicitve factor and that's the main problem.
---
Lots of things have addictive qualities that we don't outlaw, because addiction fundamentally is a dopamine dependency, which means in order to outlaw or regulate everything addictive, we'd have to outlaw everything that's fun. 
---
People destroy their lives by exercising too much, FFS. The government should not be playing whack-a-mole trying to regulate everything that can be addictive, and the only reason they even try is because someone else wants a bigger piece of the pie, public outcry is **so** high about the negative health effects that politicians will lose their jobs if they don't do something (smoking), or government is trying to concentrate the vices in one place so they can tax them more easily. 
---
Nobody actually tries to regulate these things for virtuous reasons. 
---
&gt; And unlike casinos games have no age restriction for buying lootboxes therefore there is no protection for underaged players.
---
There is just as much protection for underaged players as there is for junk food, sugar, collectible card games, and anything else that kids can easily get addicted to: parents. No credit card, no lootboxes. Don't ask government to be a substitute for good parenting.
---
Oh wow good comeback, why don't you roleplay as a concerned parent and send your kid to bible camp so they get fucked in the ass literally and figuratively by "morals" the same morals you use to justify this bullshit.  Because we all know you cant supervise your children that would be far to much work and I'd you did, then father dip shit wouldnt be able to fuck you or timmy properly in the ass.
---
Eh....
---
It's that time of the month...?
---
Tbh I never was a fan of the whole thing Belgium did and I'm also not a fan of the "ban all lootboxes" thing.
---
But I understand that there are laws (mostly age restrictions) and that those laws can't be ignored only because it's the internet. 
---
I think an age verification to enable a player to buy either gems or gambling items would be a fair and reasonable solution for all parties. Without banning lootboxes completely.
---
Eh, if it remains the case for Belgium only yes. It's a bigger issue for Anet if loot box regulation gains traction outside of Belgium.
---
Don't forget to check /r/GuildWars, as they'll be able to help you better with GW1.
---
If what the fourth team is working on is an expansion, it will be a *long* time before they put it out - expansions take a lot more resources to make than Living World episodes, and each of the four teams is quite a bit smaller than the original expansion team. I'd say it's more likely to be a Fractal or Raid, maybe a bunch of Strikes, maybe a big update to one of the Festivals (SAB World 3 if we're lucky). It could also be something totally unexpected, but that remains to be seen.
---
Also, in fairness, Cooking 500 and build templates *are* the sort of thing you'd see in an expansion, they just don't really feel like it when they're dropped into the game on their own. If Season 5 were an expansion we would probably get Cooking 500, build templates, at least a half-dozen Strikes and perhaps even some other stuff all at once rather than as a trickle over several Episodes, which would be much more impactful.
---
Aww baby learned big kid words! I'm proud of you.
---
I dodged the classic wow. I still remember most of the quests from back then, so it would be pointless to play again, it would be just recycled content.
---
It also has so many stuff that is just worse than GW2 by parsecs away. Combat isn't even comparable. Singleplayer quests aren't really enjoyable to do in MMO. Old maps are dead once people get few levels. Nothing happens dynamically, everything is static. PvP is totally unbalanced as you usually fight someone who has couple of levels more and uncomparable gear. Even arena pvp can match you with someone 9 levels above you and that's just not fun. Dungeons aren't really mmo thing, you actively lock yourself away from all the players, I prefer big meta events with full squads like we have in HoT. That's real mmo content.
---
The quality of life is just unmeasurable as well. Games do have evolution, and wow classic actively shows how we went forward through years. Even if game was good back then, when you get better, it is hard to go back. This is not true only with this game, it is also why we don't play CIV1, but we play CIV5-6. Even just "it can actually tap the hardware resources you have to let it run better" is huge aspect in this.
---
I get the idea that people praise it mainly because it is a thing how to get away from nowadays stuff like lootboxes and mtx and such. But I also think that many of those would enjoy playing GW2 more, they just see it in 2012 optics, and never dare to try to see how it is misleading them.
---
Also what GW2 can learn from it? Well, the big difference here is that GW2 over time got better, while WoW got worse. Thus for WoW, classic makes at least small sense, but not for GW2.
---
If you have too much time, just get Factorio, you will have that problem solved xD
---
When they run it's like their legs are too close together, and then when you stop it looks like they're gonna fall flat on their face...
---
But that's already how I fix the other issues in my life.
---
&gt; There is just as much protection for underaged players as there is for junk food, sugar, collectible card games, and anything else that kids can easily get addicted to
---
There is a big difference between sweets and gambling.
---
Nah, but then I never played the original WoW. I skipped it entirely and basically went GW1 -&gt; GW2 -&gt; FFXIV. Most of Classic WoW is reliving nostalgia and even a lot of Classic players will tell you that, nothing wrong with that.
---
As for what GW2 can learn from the classic experience? I mean besides arguably giving players what they want, not really anything. No one is exactly pining for "Classic" GW2.
---
This is why i'm not PR   I wouldnt speak vaguely and imply things are being worked on that aren't. You really don't seem to be very familiar with modern PR speak or corporate speak have you never worked for a fortune 500 and seen it in action?
---
Lot of people don't understand why WoW Classic is so good. It's a mix of outright ignorance and irrational hatred.
---
What made WoW a killer back in its day, and now once again, is not the gameplay, the lore, or any of that. **It's the social aspect.**
---
Lot of people have forgotten what MMORPG means. Let me spell it for you: Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. You want to play with other people, lots of them, and you want to coexist with them in a restricted social environment connected to the game.

GW2 is a failed MMO in comparison, because you barely talk to anyone. They could replace half the players by bots any day, and you wouldn't even notice. Even GW1 with the heroes had more socialization than GW2, which at this point has become a glorified single player game; sans the few obvious exceptions.
---
In WoW you are forced to socialize. You want to complete any quests with a handful of mobs? You need to party. You need specific good or services? No way you could level up all of them on your own, so you gotta ask someone else. You want to play dungeons and raids? You need to learn to listen, but to express yourself too. You want to be an asshole? Good luck when the whole server learns about it, and you no longer have anyone to play with.
---
Yeah, WoW isn't perfect. Myself, I despise the gameplay (too slow and clunky), and the lore is quite disappointing too (following it since Warcraft III), but you gotta recognize the things it does right, and it nails what matters the most: The community.
---
The graphics, the nostalgia, the whatever... They don't mean shit. If you ever bothered paying attention to any of the WoW Classic promoters, you'd know, because they've explained it many times.
---
As a bonus, back when it was released, the gaming industry had far more standards than now. Microtransactions weren't a thing yet, so the game design wasn't affected by any kind of bullshit like that. You see this in the reward system, which is quite frankly tormenting; but in exchange, everything has prestige, giving people goals and pride about their accomplishments, even if loot design isn't perfect. GW2 prestige is nonexistent, leaving us with no "reward carrots" once we're done with the basic crap.
---
Downscale your UI and let us customize where we put our bars.
---
Ive got a minimalist ui in wow and can see the entirety of the screen...
---
I got reply from its OP. So the reason was that "it has been removed by mods/automod because "it had too many negative reports"".
---
So, there you have it. Censorship even on this sub. Despicable.
---
This is my favourite event of all the events put on in gw. can't wait to participate ❤❤❤
---
Careful what you wish for ... chasing gold has nearly ruined the spontaneity of fun game play for me.  I always wonder at gold per hour or the huge lack of rewards in PoF zones.
---
Watching all these wow streams (and with the timing of being upset with gw2) led me to try out FF14 (their free trial up to level 30).  I think it was just a perfect timing thing, looking for a new game to fill the mmo void gw2 left, etc.  Been leveling toons there and so far it's actually fun.  The combat is a huge difference from gw2 but for some reason it doesn't bother me.  It's a traditional mmo, and for some reason that doesn't bother me at all.  It actually feels good to fill up a quest log with tasks and go around doing them.  It's a strange experience, all the features I praised gw2 for not having I'm actually enjoying now lol.
---
Berserker Reapers flexing those 10k autos hehehe.
---
I wouldn't say one is better than the other, they're fundamentally different, almost like comparing a FPS with a JRPG.
---
You can always find people during the [daily Zaishen missions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Daily_activities), specially useful for hard mode.
---
Nailed it. Sometimes GW2 feels like some players would rather play alone with no one else in the world.
---
100%!!!!
---
3 lanes, leading to 6 barrcks that give distinct advantages, an enemy courier, 2 rune spots, 4 bounty rune spots, Roshan, side shop/secret shop control can be pretty big, ancient camps and if we're being generous other camps which are just stacks of free gold that supoorts stack and carries farm. All objectives of varying importance that it's important to understand and fight over if you want to claim advantages
---
I don't do it "just as fast". I took my time with PoF and did everything slowly and enjoyed exploring. I'm not getting the same feel with the LS. I hope we get more expansions in the future.
---
&gt; no other reason other than the devs being too lazy to balance having all your skills at your disposal?
---
what a silly thing to say. 
---
limiting options to create interesting player choices is a fundamental principle of game design.
---
&gt; being able to make choices in how you want to engage in combat is better than being told "no, only 8".
---
choosing *which* 8 skills to bring into combat is important.. it's what drives the strategic layer of the game.
---
And, if you've ever crafted The Bifrost or The Dreamer, a chance to drop [bristles](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Boar_Bristle) long, long after you've finished crafting the legendary you needed those for.
---
I played GW1 until its death with failure wars 2 and I will tell you without a doubt that it did not fragment playerbase, there were plenty of players in every mode and everyone had their favorites. Its not like GvG didn't have enough players or competitition. HA, FA, TA, RA, JQ, AB (even hero battles wasn't dead until they straight up removed it) all had TONS of players in GW prime and we had nothing of the playerbase like GW2 has.
---
I never once had issues finding people to play with in GW back in the day in any mode, there were even never a shortage of scrimmages GvG which didn't even had rewards..
---
They are straight up lying, GW is only fragmented now because its dead, you know.. because they abandoned it. Fuck them for even saying that, its a LIE. They don't want players to have options and play whats fun for them because its easier for them to do nothing than make new modes and support them.
---
These devs are CLUELESS. Saying more modes fragment the playerbase is the most lazy bullshit I've ever heard. I guess any game ever with more than 1 pvp mode is TOO FRAGMENTED AND FAIL...lol.
---
I wish there was some modded GW2 pirate server. It would spice things up a bit, and players would move there instead of leaving altogether.
---
I would love to see player-made skills and balance patches, I'm quite confident they would top the official stuff easily.
---
Oh, gods. I've must have made like 200 gold just from those. 
---
I only hope they are not taking drop slots from other things.
---
Actually "the leveling experience" is much better over there. While combat system itself is outdated, it actually provides a sense of progression as you clinb up levels. Gearing is wastly superior, it actually makes you value things you get, or even go out of your way to get something in dungeon (remember that dungeons can actually be aimed for low lvls?) with a group or even craft as you go (gw2's crafting system not only pointless on low levels, but is also streamlined so much that it is simply boring). Locations are much more interesting, they aren't rectangles nor they are all complete graphs of waypoints, resulting in maps having actual structure, distances, populated roads and dangerous corners. Questing is much better over there. While tasks themselves are often tedious, quest chain system works muuch better for storytelling and directing players, than events or, god forbid, hearts. 
---
Generally leveling is an experience on it's own (classic wow does kind lack endgame content, waiting for tBC  here), while in gw2 it is pretty much  decommissioned thing at  this point.
---
&gt; GCD's are in GW2 as well. 
---
No there isn't. If you use a skill, your other skills don't go on cooldown. The only thing I can think of that remotely resembles this is when engineers use their kits, and that's obviously for balance purposes and isn't even a core mechanic of the game as a whole.
---
&gt; saying you would prefer to mindless spam with no regard for CD's...? 
---
Uh no? Cooldowns are an inherent part of a game, I'm not sure why'd you think I'm for this. What I mean is when you use a skill in a game that has GCDs like WoW or FF, *all* of your GCD skills go on cooldown, hence the name **global**. *That's* the part that's mind numbing, not the fact that cooldowns are present at all.
---
The problem is that this isn't communicated clearly enough. Saying they are 'not off the table' doesn't really do anything.
---
An appropriate response from the community would be: "We believe that elite specializations are the pinnacle of creating expansion level features in a saga, and are the most impactful feature in the entire game. Therefore, we believe the appropriate action is to repurpose an entire content team to creating new elite specs."
---
The issue is they would never do it because elite specs probably don't make them as much money.
---
However, they are far and away more important than an entire saga worth of story, let alone an episode or two.
---
Well *technically* the WvW jumping puzzle has the potential to be infinitely deadly if you get matched against a group of griefers that just kill you over and over. 
---
But these days it's abandoned and dead 24/7
---
GW2 actually has more skills and more skill types than GW1. Even more if we include contextual ones like those triggered by traits, runes and sigils. 
---
It just won't let you have all of them at the same time.
---
so much dodging in his answers, just tell us "not in the foreseeable future" instead of "not ruling this out but..." etc. like wtf in the same interview he says how important it is to communicate with fanbase while also dodging questions. everything comes down to "dont get your hopes down, but no."
---
this is not a correct way to do an interview, players want genuine, truthful, straightforward information. don't do interviews like that if you're gonna give vague answers
---
you might as well "not rule out" anything you are asked about.
---
This broke my heart so much...it is just so out of touch...
---
&gt;MZ: We are looking at doing mini-seasons between the Conquest seasons, where we can do some more experimentation. The thing we need to be a little more cautious of is that GW1 had four or five different PvP game modes, which basically fragmented the playerbase. 
---
No it didn't it gave people the chance to play things they enjoy, and the populat games modes always had players playing them, RA, HoH, GvG. The ones that fragmented people were FA/JQ/AB.
---
&gt;With Conquest, the goal was to always have one thing that, if you wanted to be the best at PvP, this is what you went and did. As opposed to ‘well, now there’s actually two things that are going on.’
---
You see this in other games as well. League of Legends was like, ‘here’s another map’ – but people went back and played the original map. Because that’s the bread and butter of the game. For us, it’s the same thing – we are interested in experimenting and doing off-season things that are different than the general Conquest seasons. But we know that Conquest is the bread and butter of structured PvP.
---
No, Conquest is not the bread and butter, it is more like "the year old thing left in the fridge" we HAVE to play it, because of the pitiful amount of options we have, its the only one that isn't crap. Noone wanted PvE stronghold, and the TDM map was so poorly designed it could never foster a following.
---
League was made because of the MOBA, MOBA was created by FANS, people who played WC3 and made their own gamemode, not something forced on them by the devs as a "this is the only thing you are allowed to have" people wanted something else, made it, and it was bigger than the original game itself, we don't have that option.
---
Conquest just really doesn't mesh with the combat, and doesn't leave any room for it to improve. You either play something tanky/1-shotty and go to sides, or teamfight mid. How often do you see teamfights on home/far outside of a complete blowout 3 cap match? it just doesn't promote actual pvp combat at all, it promotes circle-babysitting-simulator
---
Do note that Living World Season 4 also brings with it two more mounts to unlock. I've bought that season because of that, though I'll probably go back and do the other seasons eventually.
---
I played some and learned that WoW was indeed as crappy as I remember it =)
---
&gt; You realize in GW2 you're artificially restricted to using the skills on your bar for no other reason other than the devs being too lazy to balance having all your skills at your disposal?
---
You realize in WoW you're given artificial flexibility that is usually removed through the writing of rotation scripts so you can press a single button repeatedly, not because devs are lazy but because players are lazy.
---
It's not better.  IMO making a choice (weapon sets, CD for swapping weapons, etc) and having that choice impact the situation (open world, pvp, raids, etc) is much more engaging than having everything ever available to me.
---
This is one of those to-each-their-own types of preference.
---
The question "what's fun about spamming the same things x4" is a loaded question that conveys your opinion that "spamming the same things x4" is not fun. It's borderline a rhetorical question.
---
lets hope its content
---
WoW encourages you to group as soon as you start playing. You can solo on many classes, but youll almost always do better in a group. And once you get elite quests, you cant solo those (pretty much). Compare to GW2 which you can play without even acknowledging another player.
---
Also, WoW doesnt have as many combat complexities, but the game is harder. You can pull too many and easily wipe--and too many can be 1 extra. GW2, most times you can jump right in and burst to win.
---
&gt;We can show you the way that you can get better – that you can experience things that you didn’t necessarily think possible either because of preconceptions, or because of lack of time, availability, those types of things.
---
We do not want this. We do not want to be convinced that "raiding is ok" as they are. We want **easy mode.** We want raiding to be *easier* than it currently is, not for people to keep trying to sell us on doing the existing raids as they are.
---
They replace precursors on the loot table, since they're used for making a precursor.
---
And 90% of them are useless, so? Quality &gt; Quantity.
---
Precursors were supposedly moved to Rare unidentified gear loot tables.
---
So the idea that a warrior could be built for single target damage, aoe damage, tankiness, or CC is something that you disagree with?
---
&gt; UK just wants to become the same capitalistic shit realm like Belgium
---
You know that UK is capitalist already, right?
---
they had 2 years to already have the new batch ready for this release, and now we get interview "oh, yeah, we might release some elite specs some day". what were they doing this whole time?
---
More importantly no one really cares about whether or not they are gambling.  At least, very few people care about that, really.
---
What people care about is that they used to buy an AAA game and got a complete AAA game; now you buy an AAA game that feels like crippleware with important features of the game pulled out and resold via a gamble box.  That feels like crap, and while it often makes more money for the developer it does so by delivering the full experience to only a small portion of their players, and those players are right to be pissed.
---
All of this bullshit about gambling is a proxy war over whether the industry trend towards loot boxes is good or not.  The gambling statutes are just a convenient cudgel.
---
He addressed that in the interview and said they are looking at "easy mode" or "story mode" raids, but that they are trying to decide if it's worth it as it would take dev time off creating new raids (or other content)
---
pvp is so uninteresting, people would rather be doing this...
---
I think the biggest thing was *progression*. Doing a quest felt rewarding. Earning a bit of karma and copper coins from a heart doesn’t give me the same satisfaction as recieving actually good weapons and armor for my current level. I understand that the rewards comes later on in your personal story but it doesn’t really make the 300+ hearts feel any more significant from just doing literally anything else that gives XP or gold.
---
Quest chain was also fun! I remember in Ashenvale there were atleast 5 quests were you get to interact with a father trying to save his daughter from a deathly illness. In the end you manage to cure her and the overall progression felt more immersive than a heart pop-up at the top right of your screen.
---
Also just the sheer amount of interaction and immersion. Wanna travel to another continent? Ask NPC’s for actual directions, wait on a boat to arrive and jump in it with other players. Need leather? Skin all the animals you can find! Open water? Pull out your fishing pole! Need to drink and eat? Here’s an animation for it! I know some people hate this but it’s ten times more immersive than walking thru an asura gate or just looting finely-cut leather from animals. 
---
Those are just a few takes from my WoW classic experience. I don’t think I’d implement every thing I’ve mentioned since they’re both very different. But I think in general GW2 is lacking in the progression area.
---
Dont give them ideas! O.O
---
"4th team is making sth we haven't talked about yet"
---
they haven't talked about episode 3, therefore it is possible 4th team is making episode 3, we don't know.
---
&gt; You should however be able to use skills right after casting.
---
Casting is another use of global cooldowns since you can't cast anything during their cast time. You're just unable to recognize how both games use two different system for the same thing.
---
&gt;Having to pause a couple seconds after you use a skill is doesn't make your combat flow and just makes it less intuitive to play.
---
WoW's default GCD is 1.5 seconds that goes down with haste. I wouldn't describe it as "seconds".
---
I have. I hadn't played WoW since the vanilla beta so it's basically brand new.
---
To sum up how I feel in high level terms, guild wars 2 is much better action game, but WoW is a much better RPG.
---
In many ways classic is extremely tedious, but that tedium forces you to immerse in the space you're in. It actually takes a significant amount of time to walk across a map. It actually takes a significant amount of time to complete a single quest. All that time means you get a very solid feel for each area you go through. You really remember everything because you spent so much time in every inch of a place.
---
The social difference is also astounding. I had more social interactions in classic in the first few hours than I have in months in GW2, and it's all because the struggle is super real in classic. Being in a group is an absolute must to have any quality of life and to survive dangerous areas.
---
I find it pretty fascinating that the removal of competition between players in GW2--while undeniably less frustrating since it prevents negative interactions--also removes all the positive interactions you have in a game like classic. Everyone is on the same team in gw2, but you also lose the intimate interactions you get in a small intentionally formed group.
---
I could go on and on (I'm a big ol' nerd when it comes to game design), but I'll leave it there. 🙂
---
100% yes.
---
The PvP system is actually a lot better.
---
I'd have armour provide defence, weapons provide damage and trinkets provide stats.
---
The stat system isn't particularly fun or unique. I don't see anyone complaining about gear having no stats in GW1. People still wanted min/max, it was just less important than skill. Except for armour value, that was very important if you like being alive.
---
Defend home he says. XD In higher elo if u see more than 2 people run. Just run.
---
in what universe?
---
The PoF content is quite nice, the elite specs are cool and add much go the game. The maps are rich albeit less rewarding than HoT maps. The mounts are INCREDIBLE. Best implementation of mounts in any game. All the different gorgeous mounts have different skills, it's amazing. If you revisit any of the content you already played, do it with a mount from PoF, it makes life so much better.
---
What a piece of shit website lol
---
Way to ignore everything that makes an online world feel alive...
---
Contact support, I heard they're making PoF available to those who bought HoT.
---
But only when it's ready to start.
---
I can't remember, it was one of my throwaway alts for unlocking skills in Kamadan.
---
&gt;Humans have their different cultures instead of being sanitized fictional races of plant people
---
Bruh the cultures of GW1 are just irl cultures put in a blender and hit frappe, its the laziest of all writing. Sylvari are 10 times more unique and interesting than any of the bland human cultures of GW1 except maybe Orrians, and they are the only culture we never got to do anything with.
---
I agree with most of your points otherwise, except ritualist was much more of an outlier than the norm for classes having different animations in battle.
---
WvW is full of people who go on their own, roaming or following a tag, and never, ever speak, even less listen to other people. PvE raids stopped requiring voice years ago (and I'd wager they never needed it in the first place).
---
So yeah, bad examples there. In WoW, you either learn to interact with humans, or you won't get anywhere.
---
You're one in a million, like me. I still have a crap ton shit from living world that needs doing, lol. But we're outliers in a gaming society that wants everything NOW. Why else do you think micro transactions are so prevalent in gaming? It's not just because companies are scummy but because there are those that will pay just to get everything ASAP.
---
We were told it was going to be like GW1 but with better movement and an updated engine, so it was a fair assumption to make, imo.
---
GW1 has quite a lot of quality of life stuff that GW2 doesn't have.
---
Finally found a post about this.
---
This comment made my day. May I re-use it?
---
Haha so it would seem. It's nice to go with a relaxed attitude about it. Saving yourself a lot of stress that way.
---
&gt; In many ways classic is extremely tedious, but that tedium forces you to immerse in the space you're in. It actually takes a significant amount of time to walk across a map. It actually takes a significant amount of time to complete a single quest. All that time means you get a very solid feel for each area you go through. You really remember everything because you spent so much time in every inch of a place.
---
Those things might sound like a pain in the ass at first, but one of the main reasons everything takes so long is to make you meet other players more easily, and it works wonders.
---
And not only will you meet other people more often, but most times, you'll be doing the same activity or going to the same place, encouraging you to form a party. It's a socially engineered trap, inspired by many of the meeting places that spawned naturally across EverQuest, which many original WoW devs played to death. Some of those devs were famous for being assholes to the developers in the EQ forums; turns out they were right all along, which shows why listening to your players is so important, since some know the game better than the developers themselves (something specially true regarding class balance).
---
Now, compare that to GW2, what do we have? Waypoints, which kill open world encounters, quick completion objectives, which finish before you even realize there's other humans around you, braindead easy content, that almost never requires you to bring help, lackluster guild system, which weakens "retention by friends"... and I could go on and on.
---
WoW is a masterpiece of online game world design, but lot of people is unable to see beyond the gameplay or the graphics. *Sigh.*
---
If you're returning, focus on catching up on elite specs and masteries. Exotic gear is fine for 99.99% of the game. The only place where you could really donate your time to ascended is trinkets/backpieces. The easiest maps to get the whole kit and kaboodle is Bitterfrost Frontier and Dragonfall. Together, you can get a full suite of ascended trinkets and a backpiece for less effort than other maps. Trinkets, etc. also confer the largest benefit per slot (next being weapons and least useful being armor). Again, though, this is really only mandatory for high level fractals. Check the wiki for the most cost-efficient means of getting to 150 Agony Resistance in your ascended gear once you have it. Then you're all set.
---
As for once you're done with elite spec and masteries (mounts, etc.) then I would look at what you personally feel a big connection to. For myself, I really like collecting skins and Immortius' Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlock Analyzer site and GW2Efficiency can do a great job of showing you where you have cheap skins you're missing.
---
Also, if you don't feel like you want to focus on one thing, don't. GW2 really encourages you to play a little of multiple areas in the game. Don't want to grind out the Warclaw? Just do a couple easy WvW dailies and make progress that way.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament
---
**Swiss-system tournament**
---
A Swiss-system tournament is a non-eliminating tournament format that features a set number of rounds of competition, but considerably fewer than that of a round-robin tournament. In a Swiss tournament, each competitor (team or individual) does not necessarily play all other entrants. Competitors meet one-on-one in each round and are paired using a set of rules designed to ensure that each competitor plays opponents with a similar running score, but not the same opponent more than once. The winner is the competitor with the highest aggregate points earned in all rounds.

&gt; No it didn't it gave people the chance to play things they enjoy, and the popular games modes always had players playing them, RA, HoH, GvG. The ones that fragmented people were FA/JQ/AB.
---
Again this is Anet just burying their heads in the sand and making excuses about why their 'method' is the best. Look at other games and see how they provide options without having fragmentation issues.
---
Well, it was stated that skimmers evolved specifically from underwater animals to float above ground because of Joko's drying out of Elona, and to skim over other hazards (Yes I know it's not how evolution works)
---
I'd like to see a dolphin or a seahorse - something like that for the underwater mount. It's the only one we haven't gotten yet. And for the argument that we need underwater content? We got the skyscale, even though we have a flying mount already. An underwater mount would provide means of travel unique from other mount species, as it's the only unexplored niche.
---
I haven't seen stepping stones being mentioned yet
---
This could be you too!  For the low low price of $60.  You can login to the game, drop some cash and buy your way to fashion greatness in a matter of minutes.
---
I wonder when people will realize that you can make a decent looking character without spending money on the gemstore first. Or that slapping a bunch of light effects on does not make for an interesting character.
---
game play is what makes an online world feel alive to me.
---
&gt;\-LS1 probably not returning as they don't know how to do it properly.
---
I wasn't playing in season 1, so I don't know exactly how everything was laid out but couldn't they create a pack of instanced missions like the other living world seasons that retell the same story in a different format?
---
I know it'd be a lot of work but they could sell it on the gem store and I feel like a lot of people would buy it so it could be financially viable.
---
Incredible work OP. Now I’m even more hyped for Icebrood Saga.
---
[Me right now.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/424/joke.jpg) 
---
I'm not sure if you're purposefully just skipping over things and saying random stuff that doesn't even need to be brought up, but 
---
&gt; Casting is another use of global cooldowns since you can't cast anything during their cast time. 
---
Okay? Where have I said otherwise? I made no mention that you're supposed to use skills during casting. I clearly said *after.*
---
&gt; You're just unable to recognize how both games use two different system for the same thing. 
---
And what same thing is that?
---
&gt;WoW's default GCD is 1.5 seconds that goes down with haste. I wouldn't describe it as "seconds".
---
A second, a second and a half, whatever. The mere fact that there's a break inbetween spells is a deal breaker. To reiterate, **I don't want spammy skills**. I want a system where skills that are interwoven cleanly and not have an artificial barrier like GCDs. I want a system that allows me to use skills however I want to, whenever I want to.
---
There are like a dozen different ReShade effects that do the same thing without being bound to Nvidia GPUs, and with ReShade the customization options are pretty much endless.
---
Sometimes you can even adjust something like a DOF or sharpening shader to get the same effect.
---
LMAO Cooking to 500 is what they regard as an expansion tier feature.
---
Yeah, I got that part, I'm just saying, the Strike Missions part, I do not want to be "nudged." I don't want them engaging in any projects where the *intent* is to bootstrap players into wanting to do raids in their current form. If Strike missions are fun for what they are? Great. If they're just "raid training" then hard pass.
---
Ummm....  Wow.  That's a metric shitton.
---
I think the waypoints aren't the issue alone, but their implementation definitely contributes.
---
GW1 also had instant travel, but it was only to social hubs that then required you to group up and do an instance. GW1 also had a lot of social interaction despite instant teleportation. It also had a difficult open world that often required you to fight through most enemies you saw.
---
It would be interesting to see a world where waypoints were much further apart--Maybe one per map in a town style area--and perhaps also costing much more to use now that we have mounts. If you combined this with much more difficult open world areas I believe you would see a much larger emphasis on grouping up.
---
It's important to consider that gw2 is also not trying to be WoW, though. As much as I have been loving classic, I don't feel like it has replaced gw2 for me at all. It just scratched the rpg itch that I've been craving, which gw2 really doesn't scratch anymore for me.
---
In the end I'm logging into both games at different times and enjoying both in different ways. Having classic to scratch the rpg itch has also made me appreciate all the ways in which gw2 is not trying to be an RPG anymore and embracing it's action game elements more and more, at which it excels.
---
You're spot on.
---
There's a lot of cool stuff in the game but it's mixed in with a lot of outdated and/or unsupported content. The quality difference becomes pretty noticeable as you move towards the more recent stuff but that's nothing new. There really isn't a whole lot of reason to play this as a grind game as there isn't much challenging content and that which is there is released very infrequently. I wouldn't expect this to become your "main" game or anything but if you get into it you'll appreciate logging in every once in a while to catch up on the new releases. There's also nothing to really catch up to.
---
&gt;  make Battle on the Breachmaker a strike too.
---
YES YES YES
---
yes it was! :)

When someone calls me at works and asks for sensitive information, all I say is "That is not information that I can provide". It doesn't mean I know the information, or don't know it. It means I'm not saying.
---
It's been a well-thought-out solution to a profession that allows the low-level materials to still be useful while benefiting the player for leveling the skill and/or farming ascended materials.
---
While it's not expansion-tier content, it was well-executed and enjoyable. I think the team who designed it deserve some praise for the implementation.
---
&gt;environmental detail
---
Don't get me wrong, your character looks okay, but when your character takes up at least half of the screenshot's real estate, it's less about the environment and more about your character. 
---
If you zoomed out more, you could've showcased the environment better ;)
---
Yup. Exactly. Imagine Apple pull a stage show to announce an iPhone case. The media would explode.
---
xD
---
I usually spend the wait for Tequatl shitposting in map chat.
---
Its stale as fuck and the way its implemented is almost anti pvp
---
They won't fracture the community if done right though.
---
It happens. We ran into the same thing at my job. We announced a major migration 3 years ago (2 years before I started), kept pushing it back due to technical reasons (with few to no updates as there really wasn't anything to tell the customers) until we finally started rolling it out earlier this year. If our customers, who are far more reliant on us for their business' survival than we are reliant on ANet for anything other than entertainment, can handle it, then so can we.
---
Really constructive use of time, well done :D
---
I mean, that is highly dependent on who you ask - you can't deny that it's subjective. 
---
People who are in the game for the Living World episodes and RP were no doubt excited to hear what was announced, especially those interested in Norn or Jormag lore. 
---
Same for those who are into open world content, or those who found raids a bit too intimidating and were intrigued by the idea of Strikes.. 
---
And, believe it or not, there are actually a few folks who are happy about the new merch they announced.
---
Personally, I found it underwhelming, but I really didn't think there was *nothing* cool shown.
---
lol! This! But nowadays raiders have nowhere to go and while waiting for LFG window, they start to leak out to open world bosses too. So there will be the occasional "Woao shoot this guy is ERP level"
---
Troll's Revenge takes an hour to do legit, or about 3 minutes to do with springer/skyscale.
---
if that is truly your experience even in raids, my best guess would be that there is an issue with the input or its processing itself. in my experience that would suggest that either your system is struggling with the game in general (how well does it run aside from the lag?), or an issue with your input devices.
---
check whether or not the UI buttons behave/animate as they should when you attempt to activate them.
---
I mean yeah both games have casting animations, but at least in this game you're either A). allowed to move while channeling, and/or B). able use another skill immediately after. More active and less time spent standing around.
---
Yes?
---
I had heard that but what I'm suggesting is taking the same story and assets and rebuilding it as instanced content more in line with the personal story or other living world seasons. 
---
Beyond the shadow of a doubt it'd be a lot of work and yeah they'd be working from scratch but they could charge for it since it would be (essentially) new content and I think a lot of people would buy it.
---
FLOCK TO ME!
---
The variety you get from GW1 skills is much, much larger though, mainly due to the fact that there is no boon/condition system so everything was much more flexible. Also elite skills felt much better in GW1 because they could just be crazy utility skills or just normal skills with a lower cooldown/mana cost.
---
ok
---
&gt;You can cast after casting immediately,
---
Yeah, **the skills that are oGCDs**. The ones *that have GCDs*, **you can't**. Is this that hard to understand?
---
&gt;goes to show that you're just talking outta your ass.
---
And goes to show that you're just arguing for the sake of it because you have nothing substantial to offer. 
---
Oh please.
---
There will be at least one (the Scar face for Bangar) along with horns.
---
&gt; Well, the build templates, if they work well, for me are expansion level content. They will have a fundamental impact on how people play the game, what with no longer needing 100 separate characters to have different builds on. It could mean that you could swap the look of your character with a push of a button. If it works that way, that is a big feature.
---
I feel like the 'oof' here is that we already have an addon that someone presumably coded in their spare time to do 'build template switching'. You don't need 'hundreds of characters', either. You could easily just carry the extra gear in your bags and switch things by hand. Hence the oof: build templates are fundamentally a quality of life feature, *not* an expansion level feature. Granted, such a QoL feature might be bundled with an expansion, but it's surely something that's the real, main features of the expansion.
---
I thought the difference in FF was in the order of say 14k to 7k, not 14k to 2k. 10x is a big difference that probably comes from a combination of bad build and skill usage, I can't imagine getting only 10% of damage even if I just pressed the default spam skill in FF since there's no way to truly mess up your build.
---
That's kinda anet's fault, you got all of these skills and combinations, they can't expect the whole playerbase to only use skill 1 then balance content around that
---
&gt; Bruh the cultures of GW1 are just irl cultures put in a blender and hit frappe, its the laziest of all writing.
---
WTF?
---
Have you... not played Nightfall?
---
If anything, I would argue that basing fictional cultures off real world inspirations is even harder than making something from scratch, because they have to really do their research on myths and customs.
---
That said,  Nightfall is the best written campaign ever made for the Guild Wars series. Its lore is really, really good. There is a reason PoF panders so hard to it.
---
And while Factions might not be good as Nightfall, some of the cultures featured in it, such as the Luxons and Kurzicks, were definitely far from boring. They were extremely iconic of GW1. 
---
Taking inspiration!= "being lazy".
---
Yeah. I want to play s1, but it would likely have to come at the cost of current story, and it gets into a value proposition: Retread s1 or move forward.
---
Krewe leader orders: *"Apprentice, make it spin. Spinning is so much cooler than not spinning."*
---
There is no chance for a standard boar to drop ascended gear. Just saying.
---
PLEASE.
---
I get my social aspect from my guild. I don't really need a social aspect from the world. I play virtually everything I do in this game with other people socially, which isn't to say random people. People who want a social aspect can look for it and find it here. It probably takes more work. 
---
I might have liked WoW more if I had made my own guild in it, but way back then I didn't know enough about MMOs or WoW to do that. I did it in Guild Wars 1 and in every game I've played since have looked for a like minded guild. 
---
Socializing doesn't have to be, and in my mind shouldnt' be limited to the open world.
