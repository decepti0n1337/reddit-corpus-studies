Tried too hard.

---
I invested in my home instance for three reasons: 1) Completionism. 2) The home instance provides long-term benefit. 3) Very quick thing to add to a daily run and effectively auto-completes 1 of the 3 daily achievements each day.
---

---
Guests that I invite into my instance are benefiting off my time, effort, and invested resources. It's basically a 'service' that we instance home owners provide, and while some share their instance regardless of any return I feel my time can best be spent else where rather than waste it twiddling my thumbs for people that rarely even offer a 'thank you', let alone a tip or some form of compensation.

Is a more useful page for that
---
Don't forget build templates too.
---
We asura, too, like to "party." Eternal Alchemy? More like [Eternal Rock-my world](https://imgur.com/DrQDy1e), now featuring boom-boxes!
---
Unfortunately GW2 isn't really an MMO or a RPG. It feels like a single player, action, story and collection game.
---
If that's the only target then why have they released any raids at all?
---
That's nice, honey.
---
If you think raids are out of place, then you have a poor understanding of the game's development pre and post launch, as well as the history of the franchise.
---
It's a bunch of deflection. In the end either the game thrives (though at this point I think most folks would be satisfied with it merely persisting as it is today in terms of activity, whether that's "thriving" or not) or it fades away as the player base continues to shrink.
---
Based on the apparent mismanagement and lack of vision that ArenaNet continues to demonstrate, I'd bet heavily on the latter happening over the former.
---
Continuing to demonize the "community" and treat all negative sentiment as unfounded and ill-conceived will only make the game's failure more certain and more imminent.
---
Seems like pokemon community when the national dex controversy hit. Don't worry, once it's out everyone will play it.
---
Well...it's just an outfit...I mean. They just wanted to put something cool mist related, nothing more.  
---
I mean, we also had Canthian outfits much before...zodiac stuff that is never seen anywhere (beside the weapons that are from gw1), timekeeper stuff is added randomly and not even related to chronos....they're just costumes. Defiant glass is another random stuff....oh, and wings much before.  
---
The game had plenty of stuff that isn't lore-justified since launch xD I don't see why quitting with the Mist stranger outfit.
---
Actually GW universe is pretty well developed, especially compared ot other genre-mates, in this type of prehistorical / biological lore - were not told everything by word, but what we see usually makes sense when held against the rules of nature. F.e. Tyrian "bats" are not mammals like those on earth, but draconids; youll rarely see multiple species of predators that share the same food source in the same area; the way Sylvari got their human appearance, and their "original pourpose"; etc... 
---
My guess is its likely linked to the development of elder dragon lore, or maybe theyre just really into that stuff.
---
He just deleted his account lol.
---
Goes well with all threads that got deleted earlier. Some people are either very bad at trolling or just pathetic.
---
You suggested that the amount of occurrences  was negligible, so me pointing out that it was in fact dozens if not hundreds is not a strawman. And while yes, ANet is not a person, devs working for Anet are. So while attacks that target individual devs are especially vile (and there have been several, as pointed out before) attacking the devs as a group e.g. by calling them thoroughly incompetent or even calling for their firing is not a critique of a company it is an attack of one or a set of people working for said company.
---
And I don't midn doing what OP was reffering to, since I have stated my position that we do in fact need to talk about the inexcusable behaviour that parts of the community have succumb to while other parts have failed to make clear that it is in fact inexcusable .
---
When you wait 10min for a match you're going to get matched with people 200, 300 ratings under/above you. Even if you're the god of your class and win every fight you go into, you can't be everywhere at once. If your team loses everywhere else, you'll lose the match.
---
Spvp and WvW were not casual at launch.
---
This reminds me to "one" from metallica... o.O
---
There were not hundreds at least not those that got through moderation.
---
Yes, much more enjoyable than raid dps golems. Gotta use them movement skills on diff weaps, switching utilities, traits and using consumables, much more fun to watch IMO...EFP3 when?
---
I've played Dota and Dota 2 and what i'm about to say is obviously heavily biased but the GW2 pvp chat jabs are so gentle I almost fell asleep reading the chat .
---
See casuals do ruin games
---
How are people struggling to "get 10 people together for raids"
---
Ever heard of the LFG? 
---
It's not like you need to cold recruit strangers off the street and interview them, just hit [Y] and type a post ffs
---
What a nonesense comment.
---
&gt; That was never a part of this announcement.
---
It was a part of an announcement relating to this one. They said that season 5 would have expansion worthy features, people have been in the dark for 6 months since, anet hypes an announcement, people expect expansion worthy features.
---
Everything is on anet.
---
&gt;When they originally announced that a Season 5 would follow Season 4, yes they said it could have expansion content, NOT that it would have expansion content. 
---
Weasely bullshit. They said expansion worthy content, that's what people were expecting, they have nobody to blame for the expectations but themselves.
---
&gt;That announcement was about a Season 5 following a Season 4, this announcement was about the "Season 5" story (The emails and blog says as much), which based on the change from season to saga, that probably had to do with part of the announcement.
---
Yes and again, they said that season 5 would include expansion worthy features. This was a big hyped up announcement after 6 months in silence, about the season 5 they had spoken earlier, people had every right to expect expansion worthy features.
---
&gt;You mean during a time right after layoffs where they had to work on getting season 4 done, catch people up to the rest of the team, and deal with reorganizations in the company.
---
&gt;I've been apart of those and the fact that they have accomplished what they have is damn near miraculous and probably only possible because they were heads down working most of the time.
---
The people fired were not all working on the gw2 team. Some were working on other cancelled probects and were in fact moved to gw2.
---
Again, this is anets fault for not commnunicating.
---
&gt;Not to mention, if there's no news, there's no reason to stop work to say "Still working on it".
---
People have been in the complete dark regarding PvP, Fractals, Raids, WvW, Elite specs. Are they cancelled? Are they still happening? If I'm intrested in any of these do I quit? Do I stay? Are they coming any day within this year?
---
&gt;Again, two separate announcements with two separate purposes. We, the community (myself included), inferred things from multiple sources and made assumptions and chose to ignore the context of the blog/email announcing the live stream because "But they said X 6 months ago".
---
Ah yes, the assumption that the announcement saying "Season 5 will include expansion worthy features" meant that the reveal for season 5 would include the reveal expansion worthy features. How could anyone possibly make a leap of logic that massive?
---
The mods are doing a great job - I actually pointed this out earlier. This does not mean that we should not address the problem.
---
I said a form of gaslighting not outright gaslighting.
---
If you can't see it and don't create it *then what she said has nothing to do with you and you can just move on.* When I read the tweets that started this shit, my thoughts were, "yeah those things are horrible, don't do it. I wouldn't say that stuff about the devs" and then I went about my day because it wasn't something that I saw or contributed to.
---
Nope, all i had was the guild gathering boost. I do use Consortium Harvesting Sickle with volatile glyph as well as magic find food/utility but that shouldn't make a difference.
---
Let's see *browses this very thread* oh how about this:
---
&gt; not since it became clear that the retarded guy in charge refused to add gear progression and meaningful new content.
---
This is totally valid criticism and not a personal attack?
---
"Players have been constructively discussing their concerns.."
---
Uh, I'm not sure what site you've been using but it sure sounds a hell of a lot better than this sub..
---
Hahahaha. Very true.
---
\+1
---
Admittedly I was being a bit tongue in cheek. I prefer playing Firebrand, but even I will switch to Chrono for tanking VG. It’s the safer pick, and I’m more interested in achieving a consistent clear than living fast and dangerous with the small health pool of a Firebrand combined with low toughness. I’ll do that on many encounters, but not VG.
---
To be fair the controversy she caused didn't do Anet any favours at the time. They didn't dodge a bullet so much as get shot, then remove the bullet and slowly back away from the gun.
---
dragonfall has a really boring final fight IMO. Kill some crystals is like eh.
---
This subreddit isn't for actual GW2 players
---
Yeah, they have client-side changes, and I know they've been experimenting with adding those kinds of things to open maps. A great example of this is the Trahearne statue in the Grove for those who complete HoT.
---
That would be really cool!
---
Would be more accurate if that was anet coming with empty boxes of pizza
---
Maybe they just have a different opinion to you. The term 'white knight' is just blatantly misused at this point.
---
Good attempt but it doesn't work, sorry
---
Exactly, I’m sure the devs can pay their rent and buy meals with our grind.
---
Maybe people just need to stop asking for content and play what they already got? Or leave the game for better enjoyment for everyone?  When you buy a car you normally don't ask for free upgrages for years?
---
A combination of the game wiki and the wardrobe in your bank.
---
I mean there are some metrics you can use: reduced traffic on the internet surrounding BfA relative to other releases, for example.
---
The "our position is correct and everyone else is a shill" attitude can be almost sickening sometimes. I'm genuinely disappointed at the state of the community in this subreddit, it's fallen so far.
---
It's such a shame really, I don't *want* to play other games but the game is literally forcing me to.
---
End of a era.
---
She made some fair points but when she brought up the criticism that AOC gets (richly deserved imo) as an example of unfairness, I knew that she lives in her own myopic world.
---
I agree with the OP.  A clear and focused transparent development timeline (of what they can share) **that is manageable by the company**  would really be a boon in keeping community interest and support.
---
In general I'd like to see a non-deviating plan of communication between company and player-base.  Want to go full Blizzard?  Go for it.  Want to be jumping on the forums and Reddit with Dev interaction daily to discuss with players what could work?  Go for it.  Want something in the middle of those? Go for it.  But please go for something.  And stick with it.  Set it as "thee" standard for company/community relations.  And don't deviate.
---
Anet in the past has bounced from no communication to lots.  Changing between those models, one just stirs soup into a whirlpool.  Keeps resetting  expectations.
---
Yeah lump every player ever with a *valid* criticism into the "elite player" category.
---
This seriously needs to fucking stop.
---
Newer mobs are much easier to deal with though. Sure they're technically more dangerous in certain ways, but their attacks have proper tells, readable animations, and clear AoEs.
---
It's the old style mobs that just walk up and punch you in the face for half of your health with an autoattack.
---
This seems to be happening on a lot of gaming subreddits lately.
---
Hammer time :D
---
I don't get it
---
If by items you mean armor skins, which you probably do, you were looking at the wardrobe, accessed through any bank
---

---
Yes the 4 million dollars is makes a month is from one guy in a basement in Michigan.
---
&gt; When you buy a car you normally don't ask for free upgrages for years?
---
Except no one wants it for free. We're all more than willing to pay for expansion grade content. Anet Refuses to make it, and instead wants us to pay for their art department.
---
This several times over. And if you have the ability to start it at a specific time, just wait for at least 2 other people. 5 decent players is good enough to take on anything in this game.
---
People almost *always* thank me for providing home instance. Tips have been more regular lately too now that home instances are so much more lucrative. I don't know whom you've been playing with.
---
And as others have said, if it feels so unfair to you to share your home instance with others, then don't. I do it because I enjoy the social aspect of sharing the home and feeling like the thousands upon thousands of gold I spent has a purpose. Tips are an occasional nice bonus, but not something I ever expect. If you can't find a reason to share yours for free then nobody is stopping you from hogging it for yourself
---
This is the sentiment expressed by many.
---
And many has a very hard decision to pull the plug, despite years of loyalty and love for anet
---
I think this would be a great MMO for you. I have been pretty casual with it since the game came out. It will always be my favorite no matter how busy my life gets I come back when I can.
---
It's really ugly to expect anything more than a "thank you", if *you* invite people to your home instance.
---
Cheers .

If there's anything GW2 players are good at, it's Karma Trains. Am I right, or am I right?

If only it wa just  the national dex. The animations are still on 3ds level and inferior to N64 Pokemon Stadium.
---
We are, luckily the reddit community is only a minor part of the playerbase. Most players play the game and are happy like always without saying anything.

It goes both ways, the community shouldn't get distracted by e-drama.

Wow nice tip, especially down in the valley to the east
---
We will build a new Dark Portal and will make the horde pay for it  Kappa
---
Here we go again lol
---
the game requiring zero socialization =/= friendly community.
---
I can only assume people who say it is just don't play other games. GW2 is not terrible but it's not some bright shining star of friendlyness that people like to make it out as.
---
hey dumb schmuck, still stirring up some drama?
---
I recommend you to read this blog/study. https://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/149466049419/80-20-5
---
Regarding to this only 5% of a playerbase using forums (like this subreddit) actively.
---
Regarding to [another study](https://inanage.com/2018/02/05/estimating-gw2s-population/) (it's based on the first one) GW2 had ~1,5 million active players in 2018. Currently this subreddit has 214k subscriber, that's ~14% of 1,5 million and fits perfectly between the 5% of active and 20% of passive forum users.
---
The problem is how the criticism is portrayed. It's a problem in basically every game these days. The communities don't realize that developers mostly ignore will end up ignoring negativity. The higher ups that make content for the game don't browse Reddit or other forums like it, it'll be community reps who report back to them. No rep is going to spend their days reading posts that start with "Hey fuckfaces, I want this and I want this now!" and are 95% insults.
---
its safe to say OP is just want some of that drama by making post like this
---
Oh for sure, I've stopped multiple times and come back for new content, I've got plenty of non-multiplayer games to play and I've been giving FF XIV a go. But not everyone is like us. Many people leave and simply move on permanently, I know several people that have.
---
It's pretty clear by now there is no future.
---
Hey, qq wiped on trio during the erp event
---
I'm sorry but they are over a year late on any projects that are on the table. We've already seen way too many games that can deliver with a smaller team. That either means some of their team members are incompetent or not lazy. Also, rather announce one at a time and work at it one at a time to show a clear progress, rather throwing everything on the table and whimsically see which one gets done first.
---
Yeah I know. But I don't answer for them. I answer for others reading who may not realize.
---
No its Not Most ppl praised the Trailer and the place the Story is going 
---
The outcry came from 90%of other Info Missing and No clear direction for the Future for to Long
---
who will STOP them?
---
mod? dev? who? you cant stop this, its already too late to do anything
---
Weren't the Ebon Vanguard quite far north for quite some time though? I am hoping we get to see some  Ascalonian architecture and inhabitants in these regions as well, following up on the Vanguard's story post EotN.

Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

I'm not sure what you're arguing with me for. I agree that this stuff is overdue.
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama or violating the CoC is not allowed.
---
I've only played the single player story content for years now.
---
GW2 convinced me to just not play games with microtransactions, because that is what the game ends up being really about since it makes all the money. The writing was on the wall when HoT only doubled quarter revenue for Anet. Mtx was just as valuable as an expac because of whales.
---
They are not adding elite spec because it's unrelistic, other games expansion you get like 2 new jobs.
---
but for elite specs, they literally need to release 9 new jobs
---
Not everything needs a defender.  There is not a dichotomy to every scenario.
---
I see not my personal housing in that map
---
Maybe some wierd HP catchup mechanic , like 50 points each .
---
 Just sleep deprived nvm me.
---
No, it's extremely vague and makes you think the small of the community *is* the community.
---
I agree with your post, but there is no "removing the stigma around 10 man content". This is a very real barrier to entry that can be the sole reason people don't play raids. Hell, it's why I don't play raids, except very occasionally. Finding 4 other people? No big deal. Finding *nine* in *this* game? Fuck that, especially given how dog shit pugging raids is. To this day, I feel that choice was their only mistake in their implementation of raids. Now, luckily, there are communities that have cropped up that actively do "raid training", giving new potential raiders the resources they need. But even then, the effect of having 9 other people you have to rely on impacts gameplay. How many people have had to wait 20 minutes, because Jason had to go pick up some food after the last attempt, and just as he got back Lindsay was shockingly robbed and has to log off to call the police? It's not like there aren't resources and ways into them, despite the 10 man aspect, but it certainly doesn't help.
---
He doesn't imply anyone else. The meme is only about elitist players hating on Anet. That is all the information implied and therefore that is all that can be inferred. All the rest you've added is just a bias you've formed because you want things to fall into your world view.
---
Does distort still work group wide tho??? I thought they changed that.
---
Yes, because it's only "elitist players" who make said "particularly piteful" comments.
---
Ah makes sense. I've been away from the game for awhile so I've been way out of the loop. Appreciate the quick catch-up :)
---
I can’t wait for Anet too announce their next big hit: “Guild wars 3 - Mobile app”
---
How exactly are they doing that? People certainly haven't stopped *offering* the criticism. Chances are that's not going to change until either they give a response or people just get tired and leave the game. These posts were all done on private twitter feeds of individual employees as far as I'm aware anyway.
---
Understand the tools your class brings to each encounter, offensively and defensively. Fully understand each encounter (that is mechanics/key enemy skills/animations of key skills/patterns in skill use). After that point, it's all about execution.
---
Fair enough, I just find there is not really an incentive to play the game outside fashion these days.
---
dying daisy i think
---
cause edge
---
Thanks for that answer, this is what I was looking for.
---
I had two "thank yous" today but, as usual, no tips at all. All four of them walked away with 5G in cultivated plants, let alone whatever else they got from the other nodes. These are people who join my instance from map chat, so I play with the same pool of people you do.
---
At least people showed some appreciation today compared to the complete silence I get from most people after they're invited into my party.
---
oh shit thanks
---
Captalism is private proprity, without it there is no capitalism, without it you can't trade, store or even destroy what is yours
---
I wish games could magically get as much content as quickly as Guild Wars 1 did. I know GW2 is slower than some anyway, but man, GW1 could crank out stuff.
---
Other than waiting around for people to ask in chat if someone has a home instance, the only way to advertise you have one is to openly invite people to join you. The home instance has value, otherwise people wouldn't bother joining the home instance and waiting around at the entrances. The point I've been trying to make in my post is that few people even say "thank you", let alone going that extra step and returning some of the value they gained via a tip for the time spent by the instance owner. The cultivated plants now exacerbate this problem as guests are getting 2-3x the value out of the plants than the owner is.
---
[removed]
---
One of the factors is that living story pve itself and the story alone cannot carry a mmo. Hence the disappointment.
---
Unfortunately, the subreddit has literally nothing else to talk about.
---
Check out this post as well, tons of tips: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxmdhq/ascended_food_farming_routes/
---
You're talking to a former RPer and a charr enthusiast here, just for some context. Just being able to see cool new content and being in the area I've been hoping to go to for 7 years is, like, amazing for me.
---
&gt; A good percentage will not tell you to try training first, or that you need adapt (which would be okay) - theyll get toxic instead.
---
How is that gate keeping? thats being a asshole. Gatekeeping is something like "only gw1 players know what real dungeons are" or "only 90's kids can appreciate X thing" Being a asshole or toxic is not gate keeping.
---
Seems so, thanks for the insight.
---
&gt; For example, people that don’t play are still subbed and certainly there are people with multiple reddit accounts that are subbed as well. Also dead/unused reddit accounts will remain subbed indefinitely as well (unless there’s some sort of “inactivity deletion” on reddit which I’m not aware of). 
---
You are right, but there are two things. 
---
1.) That's probably the reason why the actual percentage (14%) is much higher than the percentage of active forum users (5%). Because it includes dead and unused accounts. Also passive users (read only) don't necessarily have an account, because they don't need one. I personally read this sub for like 2 years before I made an account. 
---
2.) Reddit is only one platform. There are many others like the official forums, Youtube, Twitch, Facebook, Twitter etc.
---
It's pretty dead, but I think the biggest difference is lack of motivation to play. My GvG guilds have gone, in the span from Warclaw release to now, from practicing and playing the meta, challenging other guilds and zerg-busting other organised groups, to killing pugs (if the servers we're matched with even play during our timezones) with Core Necros and Berserkers. There's just no reason to try, enemies aren't organised and other guilds are also running small or unorganised. We don't really try and there's no reason to, the game mode at this point is just memeing with friends and chatting about our WoW queues or whatever. NA GvG scene is the deadest it has ever been (well, it couldn't be more dead, since there are approximately 0 competitive guilds).
---
So it's a bit like sPvP in that sense, once the top players leave, everyone else is running around headless and the few players who still understand how the game works either play to compete with a few people on the leaderboard or play inhouses, boost accounts to make money, or just meme on people. 
---
The balance patch is too little to shake up the meta, and will just nerf a few classes. None of that "balance" matters though because most organised guilds have disbanded and players dispersed, you can kill the pug clouds running around with core necros anyway. 
---
So, tl;dr: if your idea of fun is to run around as a big group and take objectives, sure that gameplay is still there. If you want to GvG or fight or play competitively... not going to be good.
---
I just want some1 in anet to just talk about bingo chart we had for the steam pretty much everything we wanted is on it all they have to do is yes or no ill be happy lol.
---
Problem is,  can that excitement and story sustain for 4 months without you playing other games? The story and trailer is top notched, i like the trailer and directing a lot. But a mmo needs gameplay too
---
Twitter. If you're looking for an actual response from the company, join the club.
---
The new ascended seed pouches need to be recrafted, at your own expense.
---
Yeah no.  A quick browse through the last fourish pages *which anyone can do* shows fiveish threads about the tweets and twenty+ threads about the announcement and disappointment thereof.  Please refrain from posting false information in the future.
---
&gt; nice guy persona
---
I can't comment on how good they are and how genuine they are but it's clear since people hold them in high regard that even a false marketing persona can engage the community, at least better than silence and confusion.
---
Which people? Anet? Anet hasn't said a damn thing about this, it's a long weekend. Rubi? Her tweets were from her personal account, representing herself, not Anet, and she said the *opposite* of "we should ignore the feedback." She has gone on to clarify that feedback and trolls/toxicity are different and that constructive criticism is important. Unless "these people" refers to some nebulous group of commenters in r/guildwars2, that statement is simply untrue.
---
Would you recommend starting a business where it will eventually lead you to bankruptcy? Despite the fact that you enjoyed the journey?
---
Do we need expansion content?
---
Isn't that every mmo in a nutshell?
---
Yeah, im staying away from the subreddit for now.
---
&gt; they definitely lied about "raiding for a year"
---
And if they didn’t lie then they certainly aren’t keen on learning/adapting.
---
Do any games really have a long term?
---
How is it our responsibility that other people who we have no control over and no relation to do something horrible?
---
What could we even do to stop them? Who even are they? If you see a post calling for violence or whatever then report it but that is the absolute limit of what you can reasonably accomplish.
---
I have not seen a single thread or upvoted comment that has made any threat against ANET or any employee. Not have I seen anyone defending sending death threats.
---
I know, but it's more of a statement that we've heard the commentary about the game dying for years now, as far back as 2013/2014. It's not something to really base whether to continue playing the game on or not, at least not YET. I'm looking at the Icebrood Saga when I say that, as I'm hoping it adds a lot to the game overall. 
---
I'm pretty much giving them until the new year to announce/add more stuff we need, because while I like the story and love to see it continue, I cannot deny I do want to see more Elite Specs, adjustments/additions to WvW/PvP, and just more stuff in general.
---
I would maintain it wasn't talked about. Mentioning in passing is not talking about it in a way that serves any purpose.
---
&gt; let alone going that extra step and returning some of the value they gained via a tip for the time spent by the instance owner.
---
I don't know what you mean by "time spent by the instance owner". If I advertise my home instance, I almost never wait longer than 5 minutes to get a full group. If it takes longer, I just start with less people. Also most nodes only cost gold, but don't need invested time. However, I got each single node in my home for myself in the first place, not for anybody else. It's just a neat addition that I let others harvest them too. 
---
For the value thing, other players technically don't harvest *your* home instance, every player harvest his own. Sure, most of them don't have a full home, but that's not even the point. Each account can harvest each home node once a day, no matter if Player X's home is full or completely empty, if he harvest or not, it doesn't affect *you* in any way. If he has a full home, he harvest it and that's it. It his home is empty, he doesn't harvest and that's it. In boths ways, they don't owe you anything. Neither they do, if you invite them to harvest your home. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I understand your arguments and kinda agree, but I don't see them as a reason to demand a fee for your home instance. You invite them to join your home instance because you want it, it's your choice. The same way it's their choice to give you a tip or not.
---
To the average player, after completing the LW story maps, there is no real reason to go back. It provides a step in the lore and I understand people enjoy their story, but in terms of replayability it virtually has none. I find this a poor long term investment where other game modes such as raids/pvp/wvw actively suffer.
---
I was hoping they would adress the pathetic cadense that we saw in se4. Se3 lasted 12 months in those 12 months we got 6 episodes, 2 fractals 2 cms and a bunch of reworks, 1 raid wing, 2 pvp maps i believe and at the end of it the wvw restructure reward thingy. We also got in the 6 months before se3 started 3 raids wings, the hot 2.0 patch, gliding in core tyria, the shatterer rework i believe (not sure on this one)
---
In s4 which lasted 18 months we got 6 episodes, 3 feactals no cm and considerably less reworks, i believe 1 pvp map and 3 2v2 ones? We got 3 mounts, 2 festivals, pof 2.0 and 3 raid wings (well the third came after se4 but ehh).
---
But this was a lw announcement and i at least was expecting a reassurance that se5 wouldnt have more than half its lw episodes delayed for up to a month in some cases.
---
Pretty disappointed no word on cadence was given.
---
I would like to see something like [this](https://youtu.be/iYrKYETorM8) in-game. Have a mission end with a guitar duel as a the boss fight.
---
Anet is money "hungry"? They've been actively milking the game since early se3 with more gemstore updates and tbat only increased since pof with mounts, they also relly heavily pn rng gambling mechanics.
---
Also, tbf, the extra mounts are w/e u pay the same for a mount in wow like u would for an expensive mount skin in gw2. The base game sub is still 30 or so every 2 months and theres a fucktone of earnable mounts and rewards.
---
Its called a Deflection Tactic
---
Yes the devs are releasing brand new content in 2 weeks.
---
I have to admit, shitshow Dragon's Stand metas that still somehow pull through are the best things ever. The one I was in had everyone clustered on mid and north so the south lane was a trick behind the rest the entire way there, and then when we got there people kept leaving the nascar track to pull the boss out of center. People left north to help south, and then north didnt have enough people so the boss rezzed, and then MID lost people to help north and their boss rezzed as well, and in the end we had to regroup as a map and try again. 
---
But no one got mad, people shouted memes and encouragement, and even though it was a rough go and we lost some islands, we won in the end. It took forever and it was one of my favorite DS runs.
---
Good job linking to the end, OP
---
I want him singing that and not the shitty sing talk in the live action version.
---
Certain (ex)employees on Twitter have voiced their concerns about the reception they received  
---
I'm not gonna link anything because I'm not sure what's kosher after the one thread got locked
---
The main difference is that the studio behind No Man's Sky could admit to themselves that they messed up so they were willing to put in the work to fix their issues.  
---
I'm not sure if Anet actually understand there is an issue at all. If they don't think they need to fix anything, then they won't think they'll need to change anything.
---
Also there are only like 40 backpacks in total anyway. The tab is tiny compared to weapons.
---
I've had this, admitingly paranoid, thought that maybe anet doesn't really like the community it harvested at all. The thought mostly originated from the anniversary stream and how they thanked the community, the devs, it felt really forced. It does seem they're not commited but also really wish it's just paranoia.
---
Why'd you repost?
---
&gt;Each other MMORPG titan drops a big bomb this year (ESO and FFXIV xpacs, WoW classic).
---
It also doesn't help that all of these were very well received.  
---
Shadowbringers is getting great reviews and WoW Classic saw double digit queue times on launch.  
---
(not sure about ESO but more of the same would please their players so w/e)  
---
Anet could have skated by with business as usual but lining up a return salvo only to have the shells fall out onto the deck was incredibly bad form on their part.
---
I just came back to the game, I took a break after raid 4. I saw that they released a raid 3 months ago, even this one is deserted?
---
TB was another edgy internet troll who wished cancer on people.  He wasn't much better.
---
This!
---
GW2 sub is full of cry babies.
---
WvW restructuring is such old news that it's become pure meme fuel at this point  
---
The only logical response is to treat it as though it won't come out until they show us something.
---
I mean, that's the thing though - what's the point of an mmo that doesn't actually drive people towards groups and being social? Why not just make a single player rpg at that point?
---
It's not even on the top 20
---
https://steamcharts.com/top
---
Well, they give the most boon duration of any rune set at 27%, so that alone makes them valuable.
---
They're very good on Herald and Holosmith.
---
You keep saying "any new player" and not mentioning the existing players, existing players saw this game in its good and im telling you , its not as it used to be " in its good ".
---
Anet has been using "no subscription fee" as a marketing tool since 2005.
---
I doubt they'll ever go down that route.
---
This is the darkest timeline.
---
It is a 3D action game with lots of control of your character. You can move Straff or Tank style. Dodge through attacks. Skills are very fast. No need to manage mana. *and* you can make it into an FPS or TPS with Action Camera.
---
The only games like this are Monster Hunter, Soulsbourne, and 3D action-adv. (Zelda) but GW2 is not as slow, deliterate, and punishing as the MH/SB, and more complex and combat focused than ActAdv (which ususaly focuses on exploration, gathering new tools for more exploration, etc.)
---
If that happens I'll shit ley magic
---
you will find more players on reddit then in wvw, pvp, raids / dungeons / fractals, that is for sure.
---
Yes, GW2 is a good game, give it a shot.
---
Q: what are you looking for to play when first bought this game for WvW? What other games scratch a WvW "itch" for your?
---
yes. what do you need instead of that?
---
Maps are well populated and the next season of content releases will start in two weeks. This season will take 1,5-2 years, so yes, this game will be supported for the next 2 years minimum. :)
---
Seems like it was intended to be funny. Also seems like this sub is being overdramatic and taking this, a joke or not, way too seriously.
---
I haven't read the books but that sounds so cool!!
---
Bye. Assnet will always be trash.
---
So I guess you will be removing all posts from the sub? Because they all seem to be "stirring up drama."
---
I don't remeber all the details, but there was a "Side Stories" achievement related to Primordus moving that might have had some explanations in it. I'll have to re-check it.
---
Yep. You don't give them to the trainers; crafting the dishes at the cooking station next to them is what unlocks the steps.

---
&gt; anet announces season 5 saga to communicate
---
&gt; days of unfunny memes mocking them
---
&gt; devs go silent again, everyone is somehow shocked that communication is cut off
---
Alright. When I buy a toaster I normally dont expect free upgrades (or any that matter) for years after.
---
And a message to all those Asura's... you're imps cursed by intelligence. \*insert Rick drinking picture here\*
---
Might as well. ANet doesn't care about anyone playing their game anymore so no reason to stay. Dead game is real. Enjoy your open world cause everything else is gone at this point.
---
the game has been dying.... why do you think they merged all the servers after release? The population count dropped after a year drastically because there was nothing to do and the only end game content was limited or broken (wvw).
---
Old one was a retconned Jormag  
---
It was never established that it wasn't him and made sense to assume it was when Kralk's spine was visible poking up out of the ground and the Central Transfer Chamber was built beneath Primordus.  
---
I think they went and changed who it was when they decided the dragons needed to be the size of mountains and wanted Jormag to look totally different than how we saw him similar to Primordus
---
I honestly believe that tempest is probably the biggest output healer in GW2 (maybe scrapper is more, but Ive never player with/as one). But there are no healing meters that I know of, plus, the actual healing needed for groups (especially good ones), is fairly minimal, so its not hard to make the needed checks. Therefore, people dont actually know how much actual healing can actually be put out by good players. Also, people just dont like to bring tempest as, while they can provide most of the boons a druid can, they cant provide spirits (nor can they do other raid roles like push).
---
Im curious what build this guy runs. If I need to tempest, I usually run air (for perm fury/swift), water (aura share), temp (aura on OL for share, 10man shouts, aura heal). Easy 25 might, fury, swift, and protect, and regen--can also drop some heal output for high vigor on 5 man by swapping first tier trait to the middle line.
---
Are we finally getting those? It always bugged me that I couldn't save all my variants and yet every other game had it as an option.
---
Game isn't dead if they keep releasing content, every time a patch drops people drop money on cosmetics, if theres a longer wait because they have to allocate for expansions then that's less releases for the locusts to come back with their credit cards.  
---
Plenty of games get by with out boxes expansions, for example every single NCSOFT game in existence.
---
It's a holiday. They're not at work.
---
The one thing that would shake up the meta is new elite specs.
---
What is this clip from, i must watch it :D
---
btw, just north of Fireheart Rise, in the ice there is this star and circle like area. What is this?
---
that was my straw on this game and try out ffxiv but im sure ill be there on the new episode casually
---
We don't know now and we haven't known for months at this point.
---
If the answer was yes, why wouldn't it have been given on the 30th?
---
That should be "Guild Wars: We actually have guild wars, except it's for one-person guilds only"
---
Just wish we could make individual servings of the ascended food.
---
Seems like a waste to create the healer or tank food when only 1-2 people are going to use it.
---
I'm essentially in the same boat as the OP - at least, the type of player they're describing. I just love getting sunk into a world, exploring, getting in on all the lore and everything...
---
...Buuuut I like to make occasional excursions to PvP, fractals etc. too. Variety is the spice of life, and having a wealth of decently-supported activities to take part in is what keeps me playing. Sadly, at least one of my activities feels outright broken and unfun at the moment, and the other in desperate need of a meta-shakeup.
---
So I find myself looking to other games to get my fix on that. And those other games appen to have worlds and lore that're quite interesting in their own right, so I find myself getting invested in them, instead.
---
Having an amazing world is *super important* in the genre, especially if you want players to be even the slightest bit immersed, but without any compelling side-activities some players like myself kind of end up languishing.
---
that's not an argument, that's a boring ad hominem.
---
GW2 was marketed as a casual game and I honestly think it should stick to it.
---
Besides, nobody's going to play GW2 fore the raids if they're hardcore. If you want a hardcore raiding scene go to FF14 or WOW. At this point, GW2 raiding will never compete with those games.
---
Where GW2 shines far more than any other mmorpg on the market is the open world, and I think gw2 should stick to that and make it the best it can be.
---
Got this question. My response was that there is a lot to discover for a new player but the oldtimers don't like it as much as before since we have seen most of the content we want to see, and new content doesn't arrive as fast as say for final fantasy 14. It is a great game for new players but do remember it is 7 years old and we know no MMO lasts forever.
---
better solution tell anet to change the trait to effect power instead of toughness.
---
Yo, that's entirely valid. (I dislike the snow too, so I feel ya there)
---
We will see when we cross that bridge, I don’t raid so tbf strike missions could be a good thing. As for wvw/pvp they’ve given up on that and it’s sad because players have been telling them how to fix those game modes yet they do fuck all.
---
Thank you for making this
---
That really bothers me... not a lot of profit in my 24 hour cds,.
---
I don't know it took a lot of new players many years to get to this point. Sort of depends on what those new players are into as well. Maybe they won't stay if they came for WvW, but maybe some of those new players only come for story and open world stuff. I wish people would stop judging what new and even veteran players like and don't like based on their own preferences.
---
You can say no veterans like the game, but some still do.
---
Almost every MMO becomes amazing for new players as there's more content they haven't done, that has NEVER been the damn problem.
---
Are you people now going to use new players as the new excuse?
---
I'd love that . But would be kinda OP if it was 250 power
---
Did you see the chick they could afford to hire to interview at the beginning of the event?
---
Its still ok. My server is in the bottom tier right now and there is still enough to do during NA prime time. There were fight gilds out pretty heavy tonight even in the bottom tier.
---
Oh please, leave these baseless "facts". Nearly puked reading this nonsense.
---
Oh that, I wouldn't expect those changes before near the end of the year.
---
Well living story content is solo and doable in about 8 hours. Open world involves collections which we have to do for legendaries. Raids/wvw/pvp are considered end game content and should be repeatable. Instead they focus on releasing new episodes that you can complete in a couple hours and then call it content. The rest of the player base rp’s which is fine. The problem is they’re just focusing on short term content instead of long term.
---
I'll be honest, these if's and but's are a little confusing for me because the answers may be obvious or just unable to answer them.
---
Theres going to be game play, that's obvious, we will just have to see what they do with it. And I don't know why they chose the 30th or the 17th or any other date. Probably their goal for a proper release date that they know they are ready for. Has there been a pattern with the specific dates they choose (I honestly don't know the answer to this one)?
---
Sure...if they wanted to watch their game die at an extremely fast rate...
---
So what if they are minority? Stop belittling the problem. I only play the story and LS content yet i can get behind what they are saying and see the fair point they drew. They want a concrete plan for the future and you want to believe that future will be bright.
---
I assume he means GW1 stopped getting campaigns or expansions after EotN releaed. It had something called "GW:Beyond" which was their version of Living World at the time. It was less like S5 and more like S1: no new zones, but updates for old zones to continue old stories. As an example, the Krytan throne was abandoned and the White Mantle and mursaat were in control of Kryta. They added a handful of story missions and quests in existing maps to show Salma, Queen Jennah's ancestor, retaking the Krytan throne and killing most of the remaining mursaat (it all done on recycled maps).
---
It's not really a fair comparison to S5 because S5 is much more like EotN (an actual expansion into new regions, with new assets, new enemies, even new features). GW:Beyond was very minimal in its resources and support, it was made by a team of about four or five people (occasionally borrowing an artist or someone else from GW2 development to finish the rare new asset). The updates took forever to come out (much longer than S4 updates) and were much smaller. There was also no support for major features like the WvW restructure, so again, not like GW1.
---
So again, I assume it's that there is not expansion coming out, more specifically: elite specs (because S5 basically looks like an expansion with no elite specs, it actually looks A LOT like EotN).
---
can somebody please just explain to me what the fuck a saga is supposed to be? this is a serious question.
---
The old food is enough.
---
I don't raid hardcore atm but I am trying to gear and participate in practice groups. Its extremely fun so no, I feel like Anet should have added raids sooner (like during the core game) and add some more raids in the near future.
---
Because Anet are acting like everything is all hunky dory. They’d get way more support of they were just honest and said that the layoffs and restructuring screwed over their plans and this is what they could put together. If they admitted they were in a tough spot people would be very supportive of them. But instead they book a big theatre and hype up this huge event at PAX that turns out to just be another LS season.
---
Considering a very very tiny population have actually done raids I doubt it. That informatic posted a few months ago showed 3% of the player base had done Dhuum (I think it was a gw2effciency data base so that's already not all inclusive). 
---
I've been a raider since Spirit Vale first came out, I've enjoyed clearing new wings but over the years I've stopped raiding because there's no point for me to keep going. There are better ways to get gold, I have full ascended on 16 characters and three sets of leg armor, and I have every raid skin and AP.  Raids don't come out frequently enough for me to stay with it anymore.
---
Having said that, I PERSONALLY would have liked better 5 man content over the years and more improved QoL...but we don't know if the absence of raids would have even changed that...doubtful to be honest.
---
I don't think raids were the saving grace of this game with HoT...but who knows. We saw a butt load of view ers on twitch for the last ERP (but we know Teapot used viewbots /s).
---
just as reminder https://i.imgur.com/p9QCNoe.png
---
I fail to see how its ANets fault they have consistently added content patches and have released Raids every 9 months which is a quicker turn around time than ESO which does them once per year.
---
Yes because "hatred" and "evil" are in no way subjective terms people attach to anything from rude comments to literal threats of physical violence
---
"She said it happened so it happened"  
---
lol k
---
I do enjoy being able to casually team up with others or just watch them walking around (Did a cooking thing with someone the other day... afterwards said our farewells and went our separate ways). It’s also nice that I can meet up with some friends and we can do stuff together. However, I’m really happy that I can still just do my own thing and feel like I accomplished something. I don’t think I’d enjoy GW2 if it wasn’t an MMO and didn’t have the community.
---
It’s been 2 years since they announced wvw restructuring.... people were expecting, at the very least, new elite specs since they decided to make a whole event and 48h timer. Elite specs would rejuvenate wvw and pvp and we’ve been saying this for months. More queue types in pvp so people will actually use the maps they’ve released. This constructive criticism has been here this whole time, they’re not listening.
---
They said a new world boss but that's not my point.  We've gotten new meta events throughout Season 4. You say it's 8 hours solo. I've never spent less than a month in a new zone. Not any of them,. even though ones I don't particularly like.
---
People spent weeks and months on the Isle of Instan. Ended up doing the meta yesterday in Sandswept Isles because it was up and I was there.  There's a meta in Kourna (though not the best one but it's still done quite frequently anyway). There's a meta in Jahai bluffs. Two metas in Thunderhead Peaks, and a meta in Dragonfall.   
---
Not sure why people think the living story is just story instances, because what I hear over and over again is 2 hours of content every four months.  I must be very slow because those two hours of content last me at least a month, each and every time a chapter comes out.
---
  
---
DO you know many hours I'd play a new raid? Exactly zero. That's why this whole argument is so frustrating. People think the kind of content they want will give most of the playerbase more play time, but I seriously doubt that's the case.
---
Raids already are easy. So sad to see that the skill level of people is actually so low that most can't even kill the easier bosses. And this is all because the horizontal progression of this game.
---
Because they could? Path of Fire was announced in the last episode of living world season 3, they said they wanted to do expansion sized seasons in season 5 but they didn’t. They hyped us over nothing and that deserves critisim instead of acceptance.
---
Bowl of Spiced Fruit Salad and Plate of Peppercorn-Spiced Coq Au Vin for my guild's WvW raids.
---
Why should you let complete randoms gather ascended mats, you spent time, effort and gold on, just so they can sell it on TP and lower the prize. Cutting your own flesh there.
---
That guy said something on the Internet and wasn't right !!!! You should wish him death and threat them IRL!!! That will show em who the real Internet Truther is!!!
---
You assume they're not listening because they didn't give details. That's all it is. Assumptions.
---
Wanna know how many hours I’ve played in “open world”...0 unless it was for my legendary. The rest of my time has been spent in wvw/pvp and raids.
---
&gt; The Devs did do something though: They reacted to a community knee jerk with their own knee jerk... Except where the community saw all the signs that suggested this was going to be more than just another episode of Guild Chat, the dev's responses were designed to get the community too busy fighting each other instead of leveling any more criticisms or suggestions. 
---
This didn't happen. I'm yet to see any dev dismiss criticism. I have seen a former dev point out how hard this time is for the rest of the company after the layoffs. That's a former dev, not someone who actually represents the company.
---
There's been a CM who made qualified statements and outlined specifically that she was talking about abuse and harrasment, did not specifically mention GW2 community disappointment, didn't even specifically refer to what's happening here are all. They are at a gaming convention where abuse within the industry (both from community members and industry veterans) is being talked about openly.
---
The lengths people will go to to justify "pissing upon" devs or "fed a gigantic bowl of shit" is astounding to me - no-one should ever be expected to do that for their work and it is never justified for "passionate fans" to behave that way. I never thought I'd see this kind of disgusting attitude so popular on the GW2 sub.
---
No-one is shutting down discussion but plenty of people are sick of the gaslighting and abuse enabling excuses. There is literally a stickied thread where you can talk about the announcement and give your feedback. Lots of people have plenty of constructive things to say. Outside of that thread we have people like you pretending like acknowledging abuse or calling out inappropriate behavior is dismissing criticism (it isn't, there is literally a stickied thread full of it, many of the people calling out the abuse are also critical of the state of GW2) or gaslighting the situation by pretending things that didn't happen (like ArenaNet dismissing criticism) happened.
---
to be realistic,the asc food is expensive,its gona be used by 0,01% players at best. it doesnt do anything interesting and dmg buff is so small. for fractals with static... k thats like 100 ppl XD. wvw..... XD. raids ? probably by speedrunners to make record and never use it again.
---
no they were one of the best additions to the game.
---
I would've preferred if they had stuck to dungeons, or at the very least both. The current(past?) raid/fractal release schedule was definitely not enough in my opinion.
---
Plenty of veterans want LS5 more than anything else. You have got to come up with a different word because "veteran" is just not accurate.
---
Yes.
---
Adding Raids was fine. Disregarding 5 man content was not.
---
open world is dangerous i see XD
---
Well after 2 years, and nothing happening, it’s very reasonable to assume they’ve given up on those game modes. You’re assuming that they are listening because of the lack of feedback and transparency? I don’t get it
---
So when the game is 14 years old?
---
Shouldve kept dungeons relevant with highly sought after rewards. Everyone knows theyre the stepping stone to raids. Fractals are kind of an inbetween thing but more akin to randomized dungeons but without the sense of discovery and attachment to actual dungeons
---
Because they locked Envoy armor behind raids. And please don't try to claim that without raids Envoy armor would not have existed, it would have come out, just through a different release method.
---
If you did zur compost in the first 2 days it was basically free (except for the fixed price ingredients)=)
---
But depending on which you get I still think the up to 60s for seeds(peppercorn) is the expensive part, no?
---
The game population without raids would be unnoticeably different than the game population with raids.
---
And all sylvari literally have a bush down there
---
Queues in EB and "another border" of 3 ppl does not count. 
---
EU is not doing fine yet better than NA , im in a tier1 server and we struggle to get the other two servers to have enough population to have some fights.
---
Most battles in their garrison are against 25 ppl in EB during prime time. Off hours the maps are literally empty.
---
As you can see in the wiki at least half of the servers are empty.
---
Idk man, this being the Icebrood saga doesn’t convince me that Primordua will be involved. I think we’ll get Icebrood, something to do with bubbles, and then we kill primordus which would be a very storybook end to the dragon story, since he woke up first
---
That's what I would go for. Both skritt and asura come from rodents, but while asuras are smart on their own, skritt are smart only in big groups.
---
Wait, what? Those don't have a glyph slot on them...
---
son  99% ppl dont even using food in t4 fractals. just a observation for peasant like you. asc food was fun for  30 mins and now its complete garbage used MAYBE by tryhards. no1 with brain will not craft 3g feast for himself. idiotic answers like "im cele scourge" only proving my point.
---
&gt;Classic is the flavour of the month thing but people are already dropping like flies  
---
 
---
Do you have a source for this? The last I checked they had to add more servers as recently as yesterday.
---
Oh yeah well humans made the nuclear bomb and vuvuzelas, checkmate dorklet.
---
There are obviously more open world pve players because Anet is catering the content to them. They’ve completely stopped supporting wvw/pvp apart from random balance changes and maps/Armor no one will use. Did you not see how they made fun of that “one” pvp fan at the back of the room during the event? It’s all catered to casuals which is why veterans are leaving the game.
---
a topic like this is just asking for salty comments...
---
I think Raids; the way they are currently implemented; are not good for GW2. They don't come out fast enough (nor are they difficult enough) to satisfy the "hardcore" crowd and they aren't accessible enough to satisfy the "casual" crowd.
---
hindsight 20/20 n all that; but here's my take on it...
---
I wish that ANET had made raids closer to Fractals (with a scaling difficulty &amp; better rewards at higher difficulty levels) and/or closer to Dungeons (include a 5-man story mode, and tie them closer to the living world story).. presenting the first 3 wings "as is" was a mistake; they could have made "hard mode" near impossible for all I care, something to scratch the Souls itch of getting better at the game.
---
The Forsaken Thicket touched upon longtime lore and made casual players feel left out. Having a story mode (sidestepping the boss-fights, taking a sneaky approach to rescuing your pact allies) with a cutscene showing the awakening of Lazarus the Dire would have alleviated  the frustrations of the casual crowd. while giving it a scaling difficulty would have satisfied the crowd looking for challenging content.
---
I'm not saying I want an easy-mode for raids. I don't want to sacrifice the achievement of doing raids to hand them over to casuals; I don't want Raid Legendary Armor to be accessible without doing Raids.  I want the lore/story to be accessible, so that casuals get to see the cake; but not eat it.

I don't want any of the existing raid-bosses to be used in the story mode, except for window-dressing (sees VG, well we clearly can't go that way &gt; find other way around). for Forsaken Thicket (the 3 wings) only a single story instance would be needed; highlighting the rescue of Squad Leader Bennett. Bennett would then tell you of Sabetha &amp; the experiments. The Saul, Dhuum and Djinn stories don't need any of that though; since there's no details in those stories that have mattered in the regular guild-wars 2 story.
---
&gt;I mean why is envoy armour the problem? 
---
Because some pieces of it look cool, and I want to equip those on some of my characters.
---
&gt;You can get legendary armour trough pvp and wvw...
---
The PvP and WvW armors do not have Envoy skins, so they are completely irrelevant to the discussion. Also, you cannot earn them without doing PvP or WvW.
---
Please don't conflate casuals as the opposites of veterans. It's all catered to casuals is probably very true, as opposed to hard core players. I suspect there are quite a few casual veterans as well.
---
i just returned for raids a few month before HoT release. without them and my guild with 6 static groups, i would have quit much earlier. those other people in the statics also almost exlusivly logged on for raids. while i aknowlede its still a very small sample size (50ish people) i could only see positives for this game.
---
as far as i know (or better believe what was written on the forums) there were actually people quitting because the addidion of raids, but i cant´t treat that as a reasonable response, sry.
---
The dislike towards Raids is a very unique thing in GW2 because the game didn't have Raids at release and players that only see the negatives that come with Raids, rightfully or not, liked that they don't have to deal with that here. Even Raid-focussed MMORGPs are mostly played by casual players that don't have a problem with the existence of Raids there. The percentage of players that don't participate in instanced group content besides easy LFR or story progress related content is probably not much different in GW2 and WoW/FFXIV etc.
---
I may be wrong but it seems newer players that joined after HoT are much more positive towards Raids in GW2. They join a game that has established Raid content and just try it out at some point. It's true that Raid veterans and hardcore Raiders play less but LFG on EU is full of squads with very low KP requirements with mostly inexperienced players. There is new blood coming into the Raid scene.
---
its hard to argue about "what if´s", so please do not claim "facts" and then deny other to argue about it. in truth, WE DONT KNOW!
---
The world is better off with most people so fair game tbh.
---
None of them, because I'm selling the ascended cooking materials while they're still valued above the cost of making them.
---
You are the peasant if you honestly think ascended feasts serve the same purpose as normal food. They are \*intended\* for group coverage, not for individual use. Then again, I do not expect an elitist gobstopper like you to change your hard-headed ways anyways, so this will be the extent of me arguing with you.
---
Ok, so I can then make the same argument about the pvp and wvw exclusive skins? Like cmon man be real, some exclusivity in the game is a good thing. Not like it's even hard to get envoy armour.
---
So what is a hardcore player? Someone who does end game content? Cuz nothing new has been added to end game, such as fractals/wvw/pvp and with the new strike missions releasing with the LW episodes, they’ll stop showing any kind of attention towards raids.
---
Why is the game named Guild Wars? Why hasn’t WvW been loved since the desert map years ago that was hated? Lame so much hype to tell us what we already knew. I would have felt better about the game has they not had this event. I’m not a huge fan of living world stuff to begin with so the direction of the game is hugely disappointing
---
And all humans are just vanilla incarnate.
---
Actually the amount of ££ they’re receiving doesn’t make a game active. It’s the number of recurring players which makes a game dead or not. And I can tell you there are decreasing amount of recurring players
---
dont you have legs?
---
&gt; I think a key problem is that they don't have a vision of the game mode that fits with players well.
---
Neither do players. Just like PoF maps having no meta events was partly a response to player feedback, DesertBL was partly a response to player feedback. Lots of players wanted a mount for WvW. Some players would prefer WvW to be a giant open field with no objectives at all, others really like defending, taking and upgrading objectives. Some people want to be able to gank group build necros and eles running back to the zerg with almost no ability to 1v1 equally, others want to play with their group against other groups. Some people like big threeway fights of 75+ players, other prefer small scale stuff.
---
There is no one type of player in WvW, almost anything they do will be controversial or upset someone.
---
&gt;  And finally, lack of meta shifting or greater class diversity along with rampant power creep has made fighting a bit less fun, and burnout is high.
---
Even when the meta shifts, it's usually the same core professions (warrior, guardian, necromancer) partly because of what those have in their kit (necro will beat all other DPS because boon removal is their niche, and lifeforce is so plentiful in largescale combat). Right now there is a balance patch proposed to nerf scourge barrier pretty significantly, it may not remove necro from meta (again, because boon removal is so OP and necro has so much of it along with life force) but it probably will make combat less stale because sustain will take a big hit.
---
Having said that, players will always complain about any meta in WvW, just like Overwatch players always complain about Overwatch metas.
---
Why no 100% quickness uptime?
---
We aren't asking about free content, we are asking about an expansion that we pay for.
---
There really isn't much to talk about the future of the game. It's the fourth iteration of Living World, and Anet will continue to put bigger and better stuff into it. S1 to S2 was a completele redesign. S2 to S3 was a huge jump. S3 to S4 was a huge jump. S4 to S5 will be a huge jump, if the last seven years of development are any indicator.
---
That's it.
---
I was looking for the epicness of it and the open world pvp feeling, while having objectives and castles and stuff.  And the big clashes between 3 servers at a time.  It was really fun at first even as a low level.  Problem is now it's a bit stale; needs something to help spice it up.  Another borderland would help too.    
---
As for other epic WvW itch type games it's definitely Conqueror's Blade.  It has a really massive scope which is the reason I was interested in WvW in GW2 to begin with.  Problem is, GW2 is just the better game overall imo, so I always end up back here.  But in terms of epicness GW2 could have learned some things from Conqueror's Blade
---
Peppercorn Sous-Vide for power builds, Peppercorn Veggie Flatbread for condi, Mint + Fruit salad so the healer doesn't feel left out when I drop plates for the dps classes in my fractal parties.
---
And I can tell you there aren't a decreasing amount of recurring players. See how easy that is? I have a casual list of friends that log in all the time. My guild numbers aren't done. I see the same people every day. Your crowd may well be in decline. But everywhere I go there are plenty of people in the game, even in events I don't expect to see people in.  Saying something is declining does not make it so. I'm doing some farming on an alt account in Sandswept Isles as I speak. It's off hours. Plenty of people and content getting done. This isn't exactly a brand new zone.
---
&gt; Exclusive skins are okay since they show dedication to a game mode.
---
I think it's ok for players to have a way to display dedication to a game mode, but not in the form of skins. 
---
I mean think of it this way, of all the players in the game, A. Some players will be raiders who love how Envoy armor looks. B Some will not raid and not like envoy armor anyway. C. Some like how Envoy armor looks but never raid. D. Some raid a lot but think Envoy armor is ugly. 
---
Now "Envoy armor as a way of showing dedication to raiding" works out fine for group A, and group B doesn't mind, but group D doesn't really benefit because they don't want to wear it even if they've earned it, and group C is completely left out because they want it but can't have it. It's just a very inefficient system. 
---
It's better to have Envoy armor as something where the primary determining factor as to whether you wear it or not is "do I like how it looks," rather than "do I want to play a specific game mode for hundreds of hours?" If there is to be a method for people to signal their dedication to raiding, it should not be in the form of an armor skin, it should be something more specific, like a title, a nametag badge, a displayable toy, etc. 
---
&gt;And I never said you can get envoy armour without raiding. I just said it's not hard to obtain. Since raids are actually quite easy, apart from a few bosses that actually put up a challenge.
---
That's entirely subjective, but if you believe that acquiring Envoy armor via raiding is so trivial, then how could you possibly take enough pride in gaining it that you feel it justifies keeping it away from players who don't want to do that? How can you reconcile "this is super easy" with "only those who *earn* it should have it?"
---
do you really belive they would have added dungeons faster than fractals? i mean.. iirr they dumped dungeons in favour of fotm because it was easier for them to add new fotm
---
&gt; If easy modes split communities, how other games like FFXIV and WoW make it work? 
---
WoW doesn't have easy modes.
---
Yes, it has different difficulties, but even the normal variant isn't easy by any means.... It should be thought of as "Normal, CM, CM x2".
---
The easiest variant of bosses in WoW are still comparable to the normal bosses in Guildwars at the moment, with the hardest bosses in WoW being **significantly** harder than anything we have.
---
In fact, it isn't unusual for Mythic bosses in WoW to take over 200 attempts to beat, with some races for world first lasting over a week.... Let me repeat that, **some Mythic bosses in WoW take a full week to beat**... In Comparison, almost every boss in Guildwars, including their CM's were beaten in a couple hours.
---
\-
---
If anything, this further supports my argument, and Blizzard understands that.... Raids should never be made easy.
---
"I don't see why we have to take orders from mice and talking cabbages."
---
&gt; There is nothing wrong in cancelling projects and delaying content release, if you communicate it properly. 
---
People constantly shit on them both for announcing the WvW restructure too early (even if the reason they did that was to allow community members to vote for it if they wanted it) and for it taking too long. There is no communication solution to these problems, nothing ArenaNet does short of delivering the WvW restructure will satisfy people, and even then it may not make people happy.
---
&gt; Meanwhile we're all surrounded by uncertainity, assumptions, gossips and accusations.
---
I have no problem dismissing that with a quick use of critical thinking. Do they have a source? If they don't, easy to move on with your day and promote discussion about something else. Does the source say what they claim it says? If not, I can downvote and move on. Assumptions, gossip and accusations are a self-made problem with a self-made solution, they don't require intervention from on high.
---
Achievements, exploring the details, theorycrafting, ...
---
Ah so nothing...
---
I feel Anet did the right thing by adding raids. I'm pretty vocal on this sub about the barrier to entry, but I don't think adding raids was ever the problem.
---
What encounter was this? 
---
Hard to give any feedback without much info on boon uptimes per player, etc.
---
yeah, just more speculation. again, just because you present something as a fact, it does not make it a fact.
---
its also quite ironic from you trying to brand me as delusional here knowing your long time official forum presence. you are even featured in one of nikes videos. gj.
---
fully zerk after a time if the fight goes long you cant keep it all the time this is why some go diviner 
---
ps: can 100% with a alarev
---
If it was obvious that players want content and grindable options, then devs would focus on expansions and deeper content. Then they would make money from expansions as well as cash shop cosmetics like most mmorpgs.
---
why is there so much sand in your vagina?
---
I think for now it'll be reasonable to think of it in terms of maps we already have.
---
New maps will likely be PoF/LS4 size, but behave mechanically similar to SW. When SW first came out it was just the forts. VW wasn't originally part of the meta; SW was fleshed out over 4 LS2 releases. As new LS5 episodes come out we'll see new sections open up and see the meta expand just like with Dry Top or SW.
---
Not that close.
---
I would leave the game after PoF release, if there was no raids at all.
---
They could have given anyone actual SKINS instead of another outfit, but outfits are cheaper...
---
A stream more akin to their regular format (and minus the hype-up countdown) would be quite allright for this announcment. Doing it live in theatre suggested they have some significant things to show.
---
Because your the arbiter? Well, too bad, the armor exists and is exclusive.
---
Unless I am directly competing, that would make me want to invite more.  If it was worth 100 gold, I'd likely spend a couple of hours doing it.  What I would want in return?  Thank you is nice and I usually get that.  I return all "donations"
---
But that's me and not you, quite obviously
---
&gt;Delusional man, try removing all the rewards from this game and see how much people play. 
---
I never suggested removing any rewards. My only goal is to *increase* the ways that players can work towards rewards. If you love raiding, then great, you should be able to raid, an unlock Envoy armor that way. If you don't like raiding, *also great,* you should be able to do something else instead and earn the armor that way. I would not mind if it were faster to unlock via raiding than through the alternate methods, but at this point it's moot anyway, since Envoy armor has been available to raiders for years now, and even if they opened up an alternate method tomorrow that took the same amount of time, it would still take players another year or so to unlock it.
---
&gt;You just want everything cool achieved in literally an hour or two... And therefore it's not cool at all, it's a freebie.
---
Nope.
---
This is my point. So that should change.
---
I just hope "saga" means that we get new mechanics or other stuff (elite specs, dyeable backbacks etc.) on top of a new map+story.
---
does it remove fog?
---
Most of the time ... way too much red in Bloodstone Fen. Justified for lore reasons but still annoying.
---
Nope. Exclusive rewards for specific content is great.
---
The conversation wouldn't have shifted if 90% of the community didn't immediately kneejerk and start going nuts about how they DARED to call them toxic. If the community just said "shit that sucks, but I'll continue to do my best to call out toxicity, thanks for making us aware of this, anyways here's some of my critiques on why I think raids need to be focused on more."
---
You know, like any normal fucking human being?
---
I'm surprised there was no mention of Twisted Marionette.
---
This was roughly my take when raids were announced, though my opposition was to the increase in party size primarily.
---
Getting 5 people together? Easy peasy. My friends and one or two people from LFG and we're good. It's so easy that you don't feel too bad if the party only stays together for 15-30 minutes.
---
Getting 10 people together? You are resolving scheduling conflicts with strangers. There's so much time and effort spent putting this together that the party *staying* together for less than two *hours* makes it feel like the whole day has been wasted.
---
These aren’t extreme examples. These are things I’ve experienced everyday and things I’ve witnessed on streams when I wasn’t in the game. In pvp you often get matched up with the same people just because there aren’t that many people doing pvp. You say TC always has commander tags yet your server used to be a T1 server back in the day, after a bunch of guilds leaving it has dropped to a T4 server. My guild was in underworld until there were no active commander tags, only when we needed to defend a keep or Garri. We then transferred to FSP where there is one other regular commander tag from the guild CHOO, even he is only on during weekends. My commander also only plays on weekends. There are two active guilds on fsp that wvw....
---
That reminds me, it sucks that the marks are not tradeable so even if you want to go that route you still have to level up crafting.
---
I’ve been making Cilantro Sous-Vide Steak for Power, Cilantro and Lime Meat Flatbread for Condi, Fruit Salad with Mint Garnish for Healing, and Spiced Pepper Creme Brulee for Boon Support. I feel comfortable with all of these, though slight variations should work just as well. For example, using Peppercorn instead of Cilantro can mean more survivability in high pressure fights, and making a Veggie Flatbread is cheaper than the Meat while providing 30 more Expertise at the expense of 30 condition damage.
---
They literally have no choice but to work on gw2. NCsoft didn't do that shitty firing that they did for more short term quarterly gains like EA and Activision, I feel like this was a decision they made looking at Anet as a whole over the years. 
---
Before their mobile division and even now gw2 makes ncsoft good money, but revenue kind of stagnated and dropped over time. NC probably looking at the new projects anet was working on and seeing them not really go anywhere. They saw the lack of monetization outside of open world. They might have even trolled around forums and reddit and seen the community wavering and veterans quitting slowly. There is just no way it was a knee jerk decision done to make more money in Q1. 
---
That being said they could have brought a simple **whiteboard** (like Digital Extremes did during and before Tennocon) and wrote upcoming content on it with rough launch times and the crowd would have gone berserk. Just something so simple, even if that's all it was, is all it would take to ease the community.
---
Tequatl at release was a face-roll. Tequatl after Tequatl Rising is one of the all-time great metas of GW2.
---
Why should a regular employee ignore it? Why does this behavior of harassing developers be normalized? That's literally what Rubi's point was, why do the developers have to continue to ignore it and continue to let this be the norm in the industry? There is a large amount of reasons that career retention in the game industry is extremely fucking low, and this is one of those reasons.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm excited for where the story is going. But having a live event in theatre that you stream and have a hype-up countdown for and then announce just basic story stuff without any details... It's out of proportion, they went too big for something so small.
---
Godamn i just spit my morning cofee on my keyboard thanks OP....
---
I'd be more than happy to pay 10-20€/month + 50€ expansion every 2 Years instead of having to pay for the nice and shiny skins. I'd rather work for them doing achievements or farming for rare random drops!

need it to build alacren char. Trinkets are most difficult i think
---
JeeZus another of these questions. Should be redirected to restate question please.
---
It's alive and we'll after 7 years.
---
Have my upvote you filthy animal
---
Stop defending them in the first place, stop saying shit like "whatever, they should just ignore it". Secondly, stop giving them the time of day, these people should be banned from the community entirely, if you know who they are in game, stop letting them in your guilds, block them.
---
After all that, the devs will realize that most of the community is doing their best to stop these people, they'll realize we aren't normalizing it and continuing to give these people an open platform to abuse.
---
are you sure grieving is what you need?
---
Buy the trinkets from PoF vendors in Desert Highlands, cost only 10 laurels and other cheap currency. Or do Sandswept isles and Dragonfall, you can buy trinkets with stat select in these maps.
---
Yeah, makes sense. Good video by the way. I enjoyed the meme. :)
---
Yeah, they havent been as good at filling them with life, so far though xd

Fashion Wars

They already made Amnoon look different based on the story step you took. Though I worry how different you could do the city if it functioned like this.
---
i like them its like a title that show what you focus on xd i would more say quick hammerbrand ahah to be really easy to understand xd
---
How does that meta work? Everytime I want to do some battle for tarir I can join up and know its there, with verdant brink I always join and its dead as night and I have no clue when the meta will be happening
---
Yeh sometimes I try make WvW content for myself by renoving my gear and running around naked trying to kill people.
---
“Any researcher will tell you why that won’t fly” you’ve literally said the same stuff. None of us can bring numbers to the table so all we can do is compare our personal experiences.... I’ve told you mine and tried to back it up with names of guilds and commanders. Furthermore many streamers who were partnered with Anet such as jawgous and mightyteapot have decided to stop streaming the game due to the reasons I have mentioned. Most of their viewers have also followed their lead...
---
Alacren uses full Diviner gear, not Grieving.
---
Diviner gear is crafted with Exquisite Serpentite Jewels, so you will have to your daily Hammer's Hoard for a while.
---
Sorry but you are freaking delusional.
---
Tons of commited players who did a lot for the game left or will leave. The competitive raiding scene is dead, all of the better pvp players are gone same with wvw.
---
Those people who actually put their heart into the game, made guides builds and websites to their their knowledge are gone.
---
If ur platinum and above you actually have to wait until people are online or you get matched with silvers and golds and that's not fun at all.
---
Outside of prime times wvw is pretty much done, even in higher match ups.
---
Teapot made a last erp not only cause he moved over to classic but because guilds don't have enough members anymore. qT is done, I don't think sc will continue updating their site anymore, then there is ln who were gone already at some point.
---
The only part of the community who is active is the open world auto attacking community.
---
I think skyscale was a bad example from me to be honest and the teq weapons were alot better so I'm going to go with that going forward. 
---
In open world I would argue that there is a prestige in those weapons, it showed dedication to a specific meta (which when it came out was actually quite hard). 
---
I agree, there is nothing specifically raidy about envoy armour. I am perfectly happy to see them go but in their place I believe there should be something in their place, something like the teq weapons that is "raidy". Because as much as alot of hardcore raiders (I'd like to say myself included) like to say, raids are easy, and I'm sure compared to other mmo's they are, for most GW2 players, they aren't, and there is prestige in that similar to the time dedication (and originally skill/organisation) that it takes to get teq weapons warranting a special skin for it.
---
But you can't really argue with an ideology or a difference in how you think a game should be designed so this arguement is again silly and circular as the core idea of your argument isn't wrong it's just a different idea. (I think it's just the fact that you blamed raids for gamemode exclusive skins rather than specific game design that you personally don't like)
---
Cider, i think
---
Just because he woke up first doesn't mean he'll die last. From a story standpoint, Jormag and Primordious are an idea within the grander idea of Guild Wars; there must be balance with magic. Each dragon has one elemental power and it's one weaknesses is the exact opposite of that force. Following that trend the ice and fire dragons have to kill each other. I believe they even say so in-game. I think they only called it the Icebrood saga to separate it from PoF (and we didn't even kill a dragon in that one). 
---
I'd like to believe the fight between Jormag and Primordious would cause a lot of commotion at sea that wakes up the final dragon, though I did lead myself to believe the same would happen after Kralks fall. Idk I just think that if they decide to make the sea dragon friendly(and the jury is still out on that) then Primordious existing kinda puts that in jeopardy. Maybe the sea dragon has spent the last eternity fighting some other deep sea monster
---
Or maybe you're right and we just kill Jormag and the last fight/expansion is Primordious vs. Bubbles. Regardless I'll be happy to have closure with this story.
---
Raids are not the issue, attitude of players and time limitations of devs is.
---
Oh, the only part that's active is the open world auto attacking community. Because everyone in the open world only auto attacks. Well, I may be delusional but I'm not delusional enough to continue a conversation with a guy who's so butt hurt that he can't have a civil conversation, so I'll leave it here. Feel free to get the last word.
---
Thats all dps including cleave though, isnt it? Target dps is way more interesting (even though cleave is relevant in sirens reef). You should let arc display that instead - disillusions a lot of people
---
Thank GOD it's not Cantha. I know it sucks for everyone who wanted to see Cantha, but I'm just so glad that we take a break from GW2: GW1 memory lane medley. And that the GW2 artists are genre defining is one of our biggest priviliges to enjoy.
---
I am in two AU / NZ guilds for 7 yrs.  Send me a DM.  Cheers.
---
They could have, you know.
---
They could have put 5-man dungeons in strategic parts of the living story, just the same as the final step of the core personal story was originally the 5-man Arah story mode.
---
In fact, those could have been excellent introductions to the concept of partying up. It'd be a shock now, but imagine a game where the original story dungeons were actual steps of the personal story instead of an optional side quest, followed by living world steps that introduced 5-man dungeons at strategic parts of the story, even if it was just story and 1 or 2 explore paths for later.
---
Players progressing through the story would be taught that they *will* be challenged, even in story, and need to have good gear, good skills, and a friend. Today, we might have seen a 5-man Joko, 5-man Kralk.
---
And, of course, we'd have a fair few more dungeons.

You don't need unlimited tools, one Glyph of Bounty per account might be worthwhile though. You do however need a second computer capable of running GW2 which might become rather expensive if your previous rig died or was scavenged for parts.
---
Same thing happens when you're about to place a WvW trap (like supply trap for sample), but if you die before you get to place it down, it's lost forever.
---
Because of horizontal progression, skill is very important, with vertical progression, everyone would eventually be able to clear the current raids.
---
a previous dev post here stated in a thread about how selling your home instance in LFG is against the ToS. the person the conversation was about was banned
---
As one of the pretty upset people, GW2 is a great game as a new player and does provide a lot of great content. It's is a good and fun game, no doubt about it. I think you'll have a lot of fun and as a casual gamer, being able to come back to it whenever. You are also getting a really good deal with their current but one get one free offer on expansions.
---
Other not so important stuff/reasons why people are upset:
---
The reason many people are upset is manifold...starting first with an unfortunate but understandable incident where Anet could not support a large community organised event days before their own announcement. This was only supplemented by speculation based on the history of what previous announcements entailed. 
---
Further data mined changes to the game also added fuel to the fire in terms of expectations. 
---
To top it off, many veteran players were simply waiting until such an announcement by Anet before deciding to quit altogether. 
---
Anet's history of both lack in communication and support regarding various game modes, these generally being the competitive and higher skill floor game modes has been something that is has been going on for many years now. 
---
However, this even extended somewhat to the casual community as there was a lack of a roadmap, or even a mention of any game mode other than open world and story content where some have questioned their development capability. This is hardly all the reasons and there are many more I shall not go through from content replayability (There is still a decent chunk of great replayable content) to skill balancing.
---
The meaning of an argument is not to agree with each other. We can have a good discussion without having to come on terms. But what you are doing is avoiding an discussion calling me butthurt even tho I brought shitton of arguments in the 2 posts now.
---
Either you know its true or you don't know what to reply.
---
Which is fine aswell but don't try to make my posts look ridiculous so maybe try again and read them properly thank you
---
Yeah, as someone who honestly couldn't care less about gw2's story, lore and environments, and just love the game because of the super fluid mmo combat that isn't really replicated as well in any other mmo (I have played). I don't really care if they add a story mode or something to raids, go ahead, if you care about that stuff that's good for you and it's your thing. I'm against them taking the already small Dev team that specialises in raids away from them to make content that isn't their fortay to make it. I'm also against story mode raids giving rewards but that takes it back to that argument we were having before so I will leave it at that.
---
Either way, as someone who could probably be classified as a "toxic raider" I think we will always have a clash of ideology and to be honest that's fine, gw2 is a big game and I'm sure we both have bits of the game that we love or we would have stopped playing by now. 
---
But honestly I think you should have started your argument with the point above rather than just that you hate raids because you can't get envoy armour. (Hindsight's a bitch tho so eh)
---
Start salvaging your gear - use salvage kits to break down blues and greens into crafting materials. You can keep them in your bank or sell them, usually for more profit than vendoring them. 
---
Generally, you should only vendor grey/junk items.
---
Lets be honest, it doesnt matter what you play in t4s. I've done them in all power reaper groups and even full scourge without quickness and alacrity. Just be aware that your build is not fit for the content where high target dps matters, such as the.. Challenge Motes, well, theres only 2, but... Xdd ayayay try dh as dps if you ever want to move on to that content. Less work for better results. Also the boons you give are redundant, since quick/healbrand + alacren already cover them
---
Master race and that guild, they are awesome !

/salute

I thought they were playing some eye of the north footage when they showed the small amount we saw off!
---
This is a questions thread, which is why you're being downvoted. Did you have a question?
---
Oh, Anet doesn't have anything to do with this anymore.  On one side you have a bunch of people who are fed up and peeved that they're constantly being labeled toxic.  On the other side, there's a influx of people who are fighting toxic behavior.  Which is currently targeting negative opinions of GW2.  
---
Now the *trick* is that this is currently self-sustaining.  Both sides are playing off each-other and neither will give ground.  It is possible that whatever announcement is made will sate this, but it is *much* more likely that the bad feelings created in this back-and-forth will tarnish people's feelings towards the game.  (Free association is an interesting thing).  
---
Anyway, no matter who wins, Anet loses.
---
My server's queue has dissapeared  completely for example, and a lot of others. It used to be 3-4h at peak time, now there isn't one at all. The 2 most recent added servers are still low pop.   
---
I mean the guy is right, you didn't actually expect classic to be more popular than retail? Over 80% of the people hyped for it never even played it and have no idea about all the bad shit it had, half of us from retail are playing again for the leveling experience and maybe pvp (pve is an absolute joke in classic) between patches and even the streamers and their fanboys who cried for it are literally playing it like retail with begging for items/gold, farming 1 dungeon over and over to lvl up and installing a million addons.   
---
This is all not even mentioning the game was grindy af and people today don't care or can't play a fuckton every day to gain little progress on top of way more rng mechanics than retail has had in years.   
---
I mean it's fun to lvl in classic again and stuff but the vanilla fanbase was always small and there's a good reason why it was small.
---
In my opinion once one party starts calling the other freakin delusional, the conversation ends, because you're not believing I'm experiencing what I'm experiencing or you think I'm interpreting it wrong. So nothing to talk about.
---
Ye...
---
I still find amusing that many ask for harder content but they can't grasp the potential of taking in one less skilled player into party, thus making the content harder and actually giving this newbie a chance to learn anything. It would definitely help player numbers in the long run and raids would be probably more focused when they would be higher in background statistics.
---
That's straight up false
---
Now the *trick* is that this is currently self-sustaining.  Both sides are playing off each-other an neither will give ground.  It is possible that whatever announcement is made will sate this, but it is *much* more likely that the bad feelings created in this back-and-forth will tarnish people's feelings towards the game via association.  Meaning that the people who leave the game will be salty towards it and the people who stay in the game will be more dissatisfied, probably without knowing why.
---
No matter who wins, Anet loses.
---
That’s how I felt about all of PoF and LW4. I hate the sand and humans. I’m stoked to be in the mountains now, and charr and norn are my favs. It’s good to see anet investing in all the races and locales.
---
Nah the outrage is mainly because it was just story that was ok, but we already expected that and we didn't need all the hype up just to be given a teaser for lws, they could have just released it on YT like all the rest
---
Remember though, Elder Dragons have champions that look alike - Tequatl, Shatterer etc. There are many similar/same looking dragons that are all champions. Drakkar might be the same, with the ice creature being another champion that is the same.
---
Yeah blame it on players for their missed opportunities...
---
I got huge problems since i updated my nvidia drivers as well. Sadly I could not fix it since then. Seems like better never touching the drivers as long they do their job.
---
Then you don't earn it. Not everything should be handed out.
---
&gt; I'm against them taking the already small Dev team that specialises in raids away from them to make content that isn't their fortay to make it. 
---
Sure, whatever time it would take, a different set of developers could work on that. I don't see a need to slow down raid development. 
---
&gt;But honestly I think you should have started your argument with the point above rather than just that you hate raids because you can't get envoy armour. (Hindsight's a bitch tho so eh)
---
I think both are vital points though. I mean, you and I might never agree on them, but I would still always oppose raids if they were the only way to unlock Envoy armor. I personally believe that the game as a whole would be better off if they had never added raids in the form they have done it. If they had done more to smooth the disconnect between raids and not-raids, then I wouldn't have any issue with them.
---
Because they can change and did in the past when the outcry was big enough, exactly thanks to people complaining, never to people just eating up whatever shit they get
---
I'm ok with that. Let it burn.
---
But how would that make my gaming experience any better? Elements of a game that do not make the gaming experience better should be altered or removed.
---
It really isn't that stretched of a theory, what other reason would they have to hype up literally nothing?
---
11/10
---
Maybe they could put a subscription only map or mode or raid or farming nodes or whatever, just don't touch touch the model of the game
---
Ok, fair. Of course, every time *I* say "Envoy armor isn't specific to raids in particular, and should be available elsewhere," a half-dozen people jump on top of me. ;)
---
Exactly this. Knowing if we can expect new elite specs/raids/fractals is all that matters to me. I already know there will be new (or updated) zones and content for the LW. That won't keep me in the game for weeks.
---
Especially since it’s not like you’re paying a sub feee waiting for the new content.
---
Cheapest way are magnetite shards, if you dont want to wait for drops.
---
Speak for yourself, average full clear time on eu in the past year went from about 3 hours with any group on monday to over 6. Raid population is bleeding hard, it's getting impossible to find decent groups.
---
So you're saying I post in threads I'm not interested in? And you're calling my opinion holier than though. How ironic. lol  You're judging me, and calling my opinion holier than though.
---
I posted in three linked threads and in EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE THREADS I was interested. All of them. Want to know a secret. I don't post in threads that don't interest me.
---
Being interested in something doesn't mean agreeing with it. Your attempt to silence dissenters is no worse that what you're accusing me of doing. In fact, I've done none of the things you say.
---
I don't tell people who are vets that they have to enjoy the game and I happily acknowledge not all vets are happy with the game. However, when people paint all vets with the same brush, telling people vets are dissatisfied, implying all or most vets, of course I clarify because it's reasonable to do so. Most of my reactions are reasonable.
---
Your comments here, not so much. There's nothing reasonable in defending someone who uses hyperbole to make his point. You only defend them because you agree with them.
---
Again. the holier than though thing is very amusing. Thanks for the chuckle. 
---
Correcting the record is perfectly fair. No, I should just let the wrong words stand because you happen to agree with them? lol
---
k then.
---
Fragments of Solid Ocean and Holographic Dancers: "Are we a joke to you"?

Badmouthing TB right after his death is a bad move, but he was a big figure in gamergate. Watching his actions from current year's perspective - he was no saint and people should stop glorifying the dead.

gw3 wont happen anymore, mmos are dying out in favor of mobile games and micro transactions ...
---
Yeah, those are from the challenge motes.
---
We visited the Charr homelands in GW1?
---
The only thing that dedicated fans in this game get are cheap gem store skins that are at least 2 years old and a big bag of disappointment.
---
This game is more developed towards new players and the ones that come and go very often.
---
did you try an hammer brand build did you notice that symbol got  30% more damage compare to the 10% in like one month pas patch even if you do 1000 more dps reaper give no prot no quickness no 24 constant vul on the ennemy doesnt heal you 700/s all the fight (or more if you take the healing mantra ) im not sure for might xd it make no sense then to choose reaper if you have place for a quickbrand reaper dps even 2000 more would nothing compare to jsut quickness by himself if i  give you and the team quickness its like 10k more damage+- depend on the players classes offcourse it outclass reaper its dps( not even close to a good dh)  versus little less dps two big boons healing big condi on ennemy + little might xd
---
So I'm really happy with what I was shown. I'm a Casual Noob since Day 1 anyway so I never expect anything too big, but I'm really hyped to finally see that we moving closer to Jormag. He's my favorite Elder Dragon next to the Deep Sea Dragon and Mordremoth. Personally I'm not the biggest Fan of Ice-Themes but I love the Norn, Shiverpeaks is beautyful and Ice Dragons are my favorite Type of Dragons, next to Water Dragons. I think they are the coolest, pun not intended. Also due to the Trailer hearing his Voice made me love him even more. I hope it's the same they will use for him In-Game.  
---
even if it wouldn't anger me if we have to but I kinda hope we don't have to kill him, would be cool if an Elder Dragon was somehow redeemable before they die. But that's only me again. I gotta be happy with what I end up with and adapt to it
---
I'm excited.  I just wish Shaman didn't have to play hypeman.  That's something that ArenaNet should be doing themselves.
---
I quite enjoyed watching that tbh. As a firebrand main, it was interesting to see how he used his skills for this challenge.
---
Well Necro AFK'ing works quite well for everyone. I actually used it to max out some slayer achievements.
---
My girls hanging out outside Black Citadel waiting for the fun. https://imgur.com/gU4mvjM
---
If you're looking for reasons to play a certain game, you shouldn't play it.
---
This is something that should be fun and that you should be lookong forward to, not something that you have to convince yourself to do.
---
Let it be and come back once you feel like it again.
---
They could have at least let everyone.know :'). People will probably complain about slow release, but no word of it at all whilst strikes were mentioned was pretty unsettling for a lot of raiders.
---
Good lord, use punctuation.
---
Interesting build though !
---
Big lol, soulbeast is fine, you can kill things with reaper, its simply finding people.
---
no, kicking players for bad dps is in my opinion toxicity between raiders and I was referring to toxicity between raiders and non raiders that had its origin in the discussion about dps meters.
---
At least for me, the presence of dps meters was (another) reason not to try raids.
---
what does that have to do with OP?
---
Reaper is a dps spec, and it fills a dps spot not a support spot. A quickbrand doesnt reach a reapers dps. Besides that, a reaper can keep up 25 stacks of vulnerability by itself, not that it matters. While it doesnt quite reach a dragonhunters dps, its far and beyond any kind of power quickbrand.
---
Also, power quickbrand is usually played in no heal comps, since alacrigade deals higher dps than a quickbrand. The heals are also worse if the group does not stack.
---
Your build is probably kind of alright, but in the end its just a worse version of something already existing
---
Sorry, i m lost my punctuation notion from never doing it. xd
---
I love exotic buidl and wanted with my soul to make it works enough to be a choice for people. xd
---
You get trashed for doing mod work and not thanked for all the effort you put in.
---
And it shouldn't be up for the community to make a place for people who want the game to improve to share theirs ideas on how to do so
---
You dont really do raids. You post how raids arent a priority to raid threads, repeatedly, even when its valid criticism.
---
Your wvw and pvp is very casual. You undermine criticism there going I play them casually and it's fine. Again not willing to discuss criticism. 
---
It's ok, you believe as you wish and write everyone who you disagree with off as loud minority, trolls or motivated by tpot. Just know that some people think your opinions did more harm than good, both for discussions and how the community responds to constructive criticism, in turn learning not to bother and be plain toxic.
---
You’re missing out m friend. BSF is a great place to farm wood.
---
It's the only bolded part and mainly false. Anet will never exclude majority of population for such a good feature.
---
Imagine if she didnt tho, we all die and perish, lost to time, enter GW3 lulwot.
---
Careful, you'll get downvoted massively for making sense like this. And I wish that was a joke but the community here is downvoting any posts similar to yours. They'll probably downvote mine for pointing it out too, since they use it as a dislike button instead of using it for off topic or offensive posts.
---
iirc Sun's Refuge was an experiment to see how well it would work. Perhaps this was the plan all along?
---
Yes in EotN we got the far shiver peaks, the tarnished coast, the charr homelands, the depth, the verdant cascades and sparkly fen in the south.
---
Charr homelands consisted of 3 maps:
---
Dalada uplands, grothmar ward owns and sacnoth Valley (the later two are probably the area that will be covered by the prologue map) there were also 2 outposts and 4 dungeons that belonged to the area.
---
Well to get races in GW2 we have to start small, If it was up to me we would have a ton of new races,but I'm not in charge and anet wont put many resources on this.
---
First step is cultural armor only, access to own story and access to all maps of living world 5.
---
Free character slot would be available for a new race only
---
&gt; are 18 slot equipment boxes worth it?? does it include rare/uncommon bags of gear??? 
---
They are containers, empty bags, they don't include any equipment.
---
Lol "friend" aad in free alt account ti unlock Daily login reward. I wish too
---
Sure you could probably argue that that is a very big peak in animosity (I don't know if I would call it toxicity) between raiders and no raiders. But from a broader context there has always been animosity between people who mainly play instanced group content (dungeons, fractals, raids) and people who don't.
---
I played at release and for like maybe 6 months. I want to say castles were just going live when I stopped playing Archeage.
---
I think crafting or trade skills is the term you are looking for. It isn't that I don't like non combat mechanics I just don't elevate them without reason. The only reason the trade skills in Archeage are worth anything were the labor point system and that you couldn't reach max level at all of them. Beyond that its the same shit as every other game. Archeage = Click to harvest this plant, GW2 = Click to harvest this plant. Crafting a back pack and selling it to an NPC isn't really a fun mechanic either. Some GW2 crafting can make money if you know what you are doing. It is mostly a way to get ascended gear though. If you enjoy delivering back packs to NPC there is nothing wrong with that but it doesn't mean the crafting is anything special. They aren't richer in content its the same click to craft an item, click to harvest a plant, click to smelt iron.
---
It sounds like you just don't like the sideways progression GW2 uses. Not liking GW2 is fine but it doesn't change that Archeage is mediocrity wrapped in a Korean grind.
---
The angry players are vocal on reddit etc, everybody who is content with the game just keeps playing. Look around ingame, make your own decision.
---
Well, legendary stuff has such switching as a primary goal, so it makes sense that automatic switching will use it. It is not crazy at all, though, one legendary armor set costs just 7x more than one ascended armor set and you have 3 ways of getting it (raids, pvp, wvw).
---
Templates being just inventory manager letting you switch between your 10 sets of ascended gear in your bags does not make sense at all. That is no upgrade from what we already have.
---
However, as we don't have full set of legendary items available, one can pretty much expect some inventory switching possible (in the way to switch item A to item B, that way it would be regardless of its quality), also weapons cannot switch from sword to pistol, so you sitll have to rotate them through inventory. 
---
So I would not be pesimistic about it, however if you really want to utilize build templates for their full potential, that' where you should have legendary gear.
---
(not to mention that pushing people into getting legendary is very good drive for economy of the game in general)
---
Except your post still doesn't have anything to do with OPs question. Hes asking if build templates will require legendary rune/sigils *because* of that statement.
---
To op: I have no idea. Anet has been terrible with communication so its anyones guess what will happens. All I know is if they are required it will just anger almost every single player.
---
It's just who she is. Her victimhood is #1 to her.
---
I mean... Canada isn't home free at all *side eyes Ontario and Doug Ford*
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Getting 10 people together? You are resolving scheduling conflicts with strangers. There's so much time and effort spent putting this together that the party staying together for less than two hours makes it feel like the whole day has been wasted.
---
this kinda boggles my mind. in all the mmos in which i raided (wow, gw2, ff14) people complain about this, but how? unless you only want to play with real life friends, its incredibly easy to just pug the rest (with already 5 people in the group it fills super quickly). or if you wanna make sure they're decent, join a guild/static! then everyone's going to be there on schedule and itll guarantee they put a minimum amount of effort into it.
---
I agree that this probably won't be implemented as OP fears, but the bold text is literally a direct quote, so it's not "false".
---
Lol. Thats so dumb :D you see people being mad about the endgame not being fleshed out and that makes you worried about your own endgame experience. What really strikes me is your conclusion, that reddit is the bad guy xd
---
&gt; I can't imagine the fecal-hurricane that will hit reddit if one of the most promised and expected feature gets tied to some crazy stupid legendary rune/sigil grind.
---
Well if there is no solution for players without legendary equipment, I'd say it's well deserved. 
---
That said, I think / hope it was just worded poorly, they propably meant with the last big pieces of the legendary puzzle (being runes and sigils (the missing trinkets are just copy / paste at this point)), the build templates will be the ultimate QoL for those players, as they don't need to keep multiple armor sets or runes in their inventory.
---
Other players may have to keep the items in their inventory in order to swap to them, maybe.
---
you could see in the announcment while presenting the template part that the character was at least switching through 3 weapons. therefore it should also work with a 2nd/3rd/... armour set in your inventory.
---
i think it was just poorly worded.
---
to get THE MOST out of it you obviously want to have leg sigils/runes aswell, since it will be able to switch the runes aswell (which isn´t possible with non legendary ones). 
---
it could be though that it wont be able to switch non leg runs out of /in legendary armour , but i think it will work in a practical way for all players.
---
i am normaly not one of the very positive people here, but this should be very hard to fail, even for anet standarts
---
Welcome to the internet, where crazy people have biggest say. 
---
If you came last year, everyone would spam "build templates" all over reddit and how Anet never listens to it and that the game is dead without them, now they are about to arrive, so people switched to something else to spam. Everyone would want way faster updates but sometimes there is no luck into getting all what we want.
---
No, I‘m talking about the fact that many new players will hesitate to start playing the game, thinking the game is dying because of all the negative threads critiquing the lack of content for hardcore players who played over many years.
---
Well fuck me. I take everything back.
---
as a beginner, you have hundreds, probably thousands of hours before you before you start seeing any lack of content to play, depending on your preferences.
---
If a couple of hundred or thousand hours of game time are not worth investing 30 bucks to you, try looking for a better mmo for that price. I doubt you will find it.
---
The critique the seasoned players issue, is reasonable. So whats your point?
---
I've long found that people who *say* they want high difficulty tend to completely lack the self-control to self-impose limitations. They *insist* that the limitations be external to themselves. 
---
I can't say for certain, but I suspect that this stems from them not directly wanting more challenging content, but rather from wanting to be validated as being *better* than those who cannot clear it, and the less eternal that challenge factor is, the less "provable" their success is. "No proof, didn't happen." 
---
I think the raiding scene would be a lot less toxic if raiders could be secure in their own identity.
---
As someone who did the same, the casual community is incredibly toxic to be honest. Constant backlash towards any gameplay that isnt casual and catered to them. And anet trying to fix these "issues" without realising they're player issues. Just helped drive the game into the ground tbh.
---
If you already have HoT then you will get the "Veteran's Pack". You should have already received this through game mail. Buying PoF now will get you PoF plus whatever ad-ons you choose when you buy it. This was addressed in the announcement.
---
Its a flood because many people are upset. Where do you want them to post it, in a hidden corner? Rather, you should be grateful to be informed about the downsides of investing time into this game.
---
&gt; This is why the raiding community is small.
---
No it's not. People in high end content in every game will act this same way and it doesn't kill off the community. The raiding community is small because anet doesn't give a shit about raids. If you want to play a shitty build no one is stopping you. They can only stop you from doing it in their groups, particularly when a requirement for completing the content is that people contribute to an extent. Expecting people to carry their weight in group content isn't so much to ask.
---
yeah, its a very low possibility, and just speculation on my part. but we sadly can´t see/deduce anything else from the 7 second work in progress clip :(
---
i mean it is seen like just above staff reaper doesnt have this repuation for a second class meta but hammer has because before the symbol buff he has even prob 1500 less damage and some others things i forgot it but now it can work but people still believe its completely trash  i dotn want it to be really love( the title is mroe a joke ) but i want that people doesnt tell me that i should change to gs even there is no healbrand and there are a scarpper and 2 scourge dps xd i want that hammer is accepted as choice and when people tell if there is a way to make hammer work i want to hear less no its useless take gs because there some good points on it
---
There are reason why ppl are mad about current future contents. Basically there are so many unknown lore / undiscovered area in GW2. Me and the weeb boyz want cantha and deep sea dragon while others want to know others (Joko, magdaer, wizard's house in  kessex hills, why is there logans painting in caudecus manor, you name it). The recent presentation was unfilling honestly. The content directly related to game was the new livling world and combat mode swap. Anet could have made it better by showing the trailer of new living world at the very end of presentation.
---
Yes and no. It's not that "less people wanted to try it," so much as "most of the people who played GW2 were the sort of players who would **never** enjoy raiding, and that's *why* they were playing GW2 rather than some other game."
---
I think that if GW2 had launched with raid content equivalent to what we've seen, they might have gained/retained an entirely different set of players that either left early or never showed up, but I think all the same people who are annoyed with raids today would have been just as annoyed with them then.
---
Well, with FFXIV the patch cycles are very regular and you basically know what’s going to be in each one. You know that even number patches have the 8 man raid content while odd number ones have the 24 man raid content, for example. Some things they’ve told us about ages ago, like they’re doing the reconstruction of Ishgard starting in 5.1. We first heard about it almost a year ago, and they’ve put out the patch it would start in shortly after. Same with the Blue Mage content. They’ve given details about how it will be rolled out for months.
---
Imma keep playing the game since I still like the contents and such.
---
And I forgot to mention the easy mode of raid in upcommig patch.
---
Rata Sum has nothing :(
---
I kinda want to try this, but no video, proper arc dps log, build and punctuation kinda dampened the interest..
---
Literally nothing. He just likes to bitch about the fame we’re busy having fun w/
---
those new thief skills made it a bit too obvious that completely new elite specs may not happen. theyre probably from a cancelled xpac or smth
---
no idea about game but account support is not working at least from 4 days...
---
If you need legendaries for build templates look at it this way, if you don’t have legendary runes and sigils and then you either have separate ascended sets that are quick to swap and that you can’t take runes and sigils out of anyway or you have legendary gear which would stat swap and changing runes and sigils is just as quick as changing ascended sets (this as long as the hero panel still works like it did pre-customise). People still won’t be happy if you need legendaries for build templates, but traits and skills will be switched and weapons are since we saw at least 3 weaponswaps in the preview. It would still speed up build switching even without legendary armour and runes.
---
I feel like we won’t need legendary gear, we can see the switch between 3 weapon sets on engi and Mike Z also mentions using build templates to show of in Lion’s Arch. Which suggests using it for switching between sets to show off skins.
---
Just about every MMO jas these posts. Hell even WoW has posts about "game dying" when subs start dropping between expansions.
---
The point is i have an rx480 :D
---
Well i think my best alternative at this point should be to use reshade with a preset similar to the one i have in gw2hook
---
They should really make a Expansions + Living Story bundle that would give you all the previous seasons. The gaps in story have to be terrible for new  players.
---
nah people are not liek that because if they play with me they know what im capable even people with arc dps are really impress that what i can do in general and keeping boons or i just clean mobs very strongly like on the pic people who says to me the bad thing are people who are scared before beginning or dont have arc dps just feeling or when i defend a friend (rarely) and he begin to tell me that hammer make no sense ans say i suck xd if im doing bad its not abouth dps boons and all its abouth im dying but its happens rarely since my build has big substain and tankiness
---
Oh, i see, Diviner. Okay, well thank you for that already. Do you have a build? Maybe a meta build on a good website you can share?
---
i looked those up:

---
so it says grieving on the build website.
---
&gt; Both Rubi threads got locked yesterday, and the same happened to several other threads complaining about the state of the game a month ago. There was this stickied thread created by the mods to silence people who were complaining.
---
Just as a heads-up, I disagreed with both decisions and opened up the posts again. I'm talking to the team about this stuff, but I really don't think we should be going down the direction we're currently going.
---
allows you to play seasons 3-5 but doesn't unlock them

I am not. I just looked up alacren, as Fracs meta groups want that and found this:

---
and there it states grieving :/ So i dont know actually
---
Unlikely. They are way too similar to the old trap functionality and effect wise to exist alongside them.
---
thats some shit wording then lol
---
Not necessarily.
---
I would also like to see the game evolve on multiple fronts, including more customisation for my main via elite specs, but if ANet decide that introducing more specs breaks the game too much (think PvP, WvW, but also balancing future raids... i really don't want Shadow Form A/X meta again) - it's fine to stop where we currently are.
---
If they weave it into the world somehow - somehow explain that Tyria is not getting any more specs, at least for the foreseeable future, with an in-world explanation - and they would ***communicate*** this as their plan and intention... no problem!
---
First a good rebalance. Due to cores underperforming and some elite specs being flat out busted, the real diversity of playstyles that comes from current one is greatly limited. This adds in no small part to player hunger for new especs.

Imagine a necro player. If he wants to be viable in end game pve - core necro is out of the question. That's 1/3 of necro paths being stripped away due to poor balance. And if said player hates playing scourge? Then he's down to reaper and reaper only. With proper balance in place he'd have twice the choices (reaper or core). And i think it's not unfair to assume not everyone loves each elite spec for their profession.
---
I like your music taste
---
Yes
---
chrono is dying because the dps he does is half or third mine so people prefer rev dps who is at least better then chrono for sure if the rotation are well made
---
or you could tell that they want to make core playable and interesting so that peope will have 3 ways to play rather then 2. Because they know we will not get another way anytime soon (2 years)
---
Yes , most of them are ingame
---
It doesn't say you get access to past LS episodes. Probably just unlocks future LS content if you are online then. As it has always been.
---
i mean, they have "free hot"... just say it like with pof, no reason to add it's free
---
Action Combat — It's keeping me in game because every fight can be different and your survivability comes with your reflex, not only with your gear. I don't like games where you're strong only because of your gear.
---
Raids — Since I got into raids, killing a boss is a satysfying thing.
---
Challenges — I'm challenging myself to do group content solo like events and bounties. No, I'm not running a glass cannon build outside raids.
---
New story — Story is important for me and that's why I play Guild Wars 2 because it has a STORY.
---
But I hate if new content is easier than older. Everything should be at the same difficult level.
---
Were no wanting to scare players away - anything but. I'm sorry if you or anyone else has felt so, and if you'd like any help, I will as always be more than happy to offer.  
---
However, Anet loves new players. What you don't see from the point of view of having newly started the time investment, the emotional investments, us veterans have put into the game. In the end, for an MMO as old as GW2, retention of veteran players is hugely important. And for us, were just not feeling anything new to do. We love our game, passionately, and we want to know if it's worth staying. Whether we can hope for new content,actual play hours, in this game we so love, because we've not been getting it and were growing worried.  
---
No, the game is not dead. But as a veteran, it's visible just how many people have left the game, or only come back for LS episodes. It's tangible how we struggle to find content to do. We're worried, we want to be able to keep playing this game we care for a lot, and are at a point where we don't know if we'll be able to.  
---
That is why we let ourselves be heard like this. And there will, sadly, be the more radical elements, and I wish there weren't. But we don't want to let them stop us from letting ourselves be heard and wishing for answers.
---
They took the animations from X and Y and didn't change anything. Show me one attack anination where the pokemon make contact.
---
You say its not about meta, but you compare it to dragonhunter ~ and as basis you use a screen of an all dps displaying arc window. And the dragonhunter of reference is most likely one of those trashy t4 players. That in itself made my morning a bit brighter as well, thx i guess
---
You can make any semi-decent build work well in spvp to be honest. If staff core ele can reach plat, it should be easy enough on all classes. Check metabattle for general builds, thief seems to be in a good spot.
---
Staff DD is still a strong and foolproof build, but deadeye is generally stronger on bosses that dont have many adds and other classes have a lot stronger bursts which make them more valuable in fractals. Snowcrows/discretize have good guides and composiitons for raids/fractals.
---
Any healer is "viable" in fractals because it doesnt take much dps to clear them and basically any source of heals can help if the group is struggling. It's far from meta since it's mostly providing heals, cleanses and other defensive utility which isnt necessary in better groups and if it is, fb and scourge do that much better. Pve content generally wants offensive healers because more dps = shorter fights = less damage taken.
---
Spellbreaker's elite can be cast while moving and it's a channeled skill (not sure if you played during PoF). Berserker's been slightly reworked and is generaly better in power builds than before (however, power zerker might have been popular back when you played so it's not much of a difference). They reworked banners to be static and picking them up will only reduce their cooldown, they dont have skills anymore and cant be carried.
---
It's an old thread, from before Diviner stats were added to the build editor, it says 
---
&gt;  Grieving is used to substitute Diviner on gw2skills.
---
You need Diviner stuff.
---
I really like how the graphics look very similar to gw1, especially noticeable when showing big landscapes (the shot with the wooden effigy).
---
You'll still need to buy living seasons, either with gems in game or with money (if you havent unlocked them so far by playing).
---
Hello, i left the game more than 1 year ago cause the problem with wvw lag. Im thinking about coming back, are there some news about lag and server issues fixing?
---
Thanks you
---
I understand he controversy, but the trailer was stunning!
---
This is a question thread, not a venting/discussion one. You might want to look into the [announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cymy1e/mod_post_living_world_announcement_feedback/).
---
are they necessary to enjoy the game ?
---
Are strike missions just going to be dropped in and unsupported like every other part of the game?
---
dragon stand and Triple Trouble the first weeks
---
 i  m often  akward i m not really bright mind i just wanted to show that you can do dps with hammer and this pic was the chance in my head for it ahah next time i will find another way for another exotic build xd
---
i present to you - every freaking pvp community ever for, like, 20 years now. If any, in a world where gw2 pvp is better and the community is bigger, it is even more toxic and shitty. Yet, somehow, there is games that are better than gw2 in terms of pvp, and are more popular.
---
Exactly this. I’m not paying in game currency for a feature I have right now.
---
Why renting a theater only for this then. If you want to attract new player, you do an announced like that during game show like PAX, where the new player could be. 
---
Why a new player will come to an announcement dedicated to a game he didn't play. This is beyond stupid.
---
Another one be like:
---
\&gt; I love this game, I want new content.
---
\*new content releases\*
---
\&gt; OH NO, I'M LEAVING.
---
You could say "I love Metallica, their music is everything to me, BUT THEIR LAST ALBUM IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. I WON'T LISTEN TO THEIR MUSIC ANYMORE".
---
While this is partly true MMOs are not made to eventually drop the most longstanding commiters for new players. It is not an MMO if a player can't progress with his character in form of a gear treadmill or, which is the case in gw2, with challenging content that rewards players who understood their profession and battle system. Gw2 has enough content for getting into things including the updating story. There is no need to just drop support for repeatable high endgame challenging content.
---
Ppl do not change mmo from a day to another. A new mmo must bring something different to move a player 
---
 Gw2 moved me from wow since it said " no raids" what does the new mmo offer that gw2 does no?
---
First elite specs were released with Heart of Thorns, three years after the initial release.
---
Are you really suggesting the game was 'standing still' and 'looked dead' throughout the first three years?
---
Elite specs are one of the potential upgrades and ways to evolve and move forward, but not the only one and not as important one as you try to make them sound. And if new specs would break other parts of the game, primarily competitive remnants that we have (PvP, WvW, but also speedrun raids), the game will be better off without new elite specs.
---
_But we need to know what's the plan._
---
It is not a problem of being fanboys. Your criticism is on issue which us casual do not consider relevant. Raids ? I do not want them so your critic is pointless from my point of view
---
I completely agree. I wish gw2 worked like that. Would have been terrific.
---
You seem to forget that they've been progressively neglecting WvW, PvP and Raids more and more for at least three years now, the lay-offs just finally brought it to a stand-still. And yet, they're rather say they're working on it than admit they either don't care or don't have the time/resources for it.
---
Wasn't that done years ago already
---
yes yes i told its a second class build xd healbrand alarev gs quickbrand dragon hunter even zerk i think are on the top its nto a build to change but yeah let me change my post i need to clarify thats its nto there to beat dh like my pic can make people think that xd
---
Or maybe, just maybe waaaaaaaaaaaaay more people are into GW2 than GW1 and therefore there are also way more people making their voices heard?
---
[While we're at it, this subreddit needs to watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-2WZsP6LA0)
---
They still haven't learned to give away Season 2 nor give bundles of Seasons with the first purchase.
---
I'm not even surprised.
---
Sorry I can't really tell tbh, there's so much going on in huge fights :(
---
As the other comment said, it's just a bag. I think 18 slot are worth it for every toon you play, as they are pretty cheap.  
---
&gt; any recommendations for bag setups??
---
I like to have an ivis bag at the bottom of the stack
---
To be fair, Guild Wars 1 in its prime was around in a different era. There was a distinct lack of ability to openly talk about the game in a public manner, social media was limited or non existent and at that point was not really being used in that context anyway. GW1 *did* have issues, for example the extremely quick release of Factions and then Nightfall completely segregated the playerbase, which was definitely complained about by players, albeit in a limited capacity because of the above. Nowadays it's very easy to openly discuss anything about any game, there are plenty of outlets that are easy to access and it is now commonplace to discuss everything in great detail, positive or negative. I wouldn't say GW2 compared to GW1 is a decay in quality, it is simply a different approach. The two games almost cannot be compared, they are *that* different. Personally I've always preferred GW1 because I simply prefer the mechanics, some of the oldschool MMO styles and of course the nostalgia.
---
&gt;Would it be better if they had the communication and came out and said "We aren't doing another elite spec because we don't want to balance more skills."?
---
Yes. Yes, it would.
---
A popular argument is "I don't raid, therefore devs are wasting their time on them."
---
It doesnt take much intellect to put 1+1 together to figure out that jormag is a dragon and charr and norn a fantasy races in gw2.
---
I dont play wow but i still know what orcs and the horde are.
---
Some are, but we're doing mostly every content mode, more or less :P
---
Skins that are not listed in the wardrobe due to unlock limitations can normally be found in the wiki. Copy the chat code (something like  [&amp;CqUcAAA=]) and whisper it to yourself. Then right click and preview.

Hope the link works
---
&gt; We have too little information right now.
---
And whose fault is that? ARE YOU FOR REAL MAN? Take 1 minute and read what you just wrote.
---
Don't they take a week because of the gear grind? You must first get the new gear and only then you can attempt at those harder difficulties?
---
Well, as a personal guess, we might get "upgradable story armour which gets more shiny and gets more spikes with 2nd tier" just like we did with previous 2 sets. Also more norn-cultural stuff either so we will see over time but I do not think what you want is something out of possibilities with the new season
---
" **Sagas** are stories mostly about ancient [Nordic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_mythology) and [Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_tribes) history, early [Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking) voyages, the [battles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle) that took place during the voyages, and migration to [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland) and of [feuds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud) between Icelandic families."
---
Lol, players don't know what they want.
---
ok thank you.
---
[These are the main differences between "Sagas" and Seasons](http://gph.is/23CDnBJ).
---
Screw Funko Pop... screw this fan page.... we all know we are going to Tidal.
---
Now, you only need path of fire expansion to play ALL contenti in the game.
---
i mean underwater content we know off the bat noone will actually like. the saga has a chance.

Most of updates and event starts and things in this game usually start at 17:00 UTC, so there is still 4 hours+ before that.

17:00 UTC happens when this comment is 6 hours and 9 minutes old.

I knew this was fan made but it still bamboozled me 😞

&gt;Have some real gear progression/rarity and uniqueness.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I love the game but not liking the direction of updates it goes to....
---
Well what you want was never the direction for gw2
---
I am very upset honestly, yet the trailer was very nice. Not to mention I actually do think strikes are a cool idea, just the rest of the ??? is a mystery..
---
Magdaer, I'm calling it. They must know something. Erin gave the pieces to some smith but maybe that smith had to go on to a journey where the icebroods were. So it's possible that they have it...and now itll be a song if ice and fire.
---
Sohothin vs Magdaer as evident by that trailer towards the end there...
---
Dear Nornnio,
---
the year is 2019.
---
Event is +100% experience towards masteries progres in all HoT, LS3, PoF and LS4 zones. It runs from today for two weeks. At september 17th, new big update is to be released and for playing through new stuff, both masteries from HoT and PoF will be needed. This event is for newbies and returning players to catch up with veterans.
---
maybe you missed this part
---
&gt;
---
Like make the WVW map be a guild war rather than WVW.
---
and regardless unless the system you want is super barebones it isnt trivial to implement, much less so when you wouldnt be able to modify the client.
---
training discord 0 KP, just a bit of guides reading and knowing what a mechanic does while learning together with others at your own pace   
---
new player: reeeeeeee i want to leech
---
Since Anet left us with so very, very litte about "the future", the only substantial discussion topic is said community response. .P
---
No country is home free, but our neighbor is... *reaches for popcorn*
---
Dear /u/Hanakocz
---
Read the title.
---
Yes, I don't know why but this is what some people don't understand. 
---
We just sit here eat shit be all"positive", say it is no problem at all and that they are doing a really awesome job, and then expect them to change?
---
Sending out my decoy
---
Did you somehow miss the last half of the event on Friday?
---
I'm giving GW2 another attempt, idependent of this new living world season(I havent even played the previous ones). Imagine my confusion when I get into the subreddit to see if anyone has anything smart to say about starting a Mesmer, and instead witnessing the anger and revolt that was the top posts.. 
---
The state of this subreddit made me question if I was entering a sinking ship, and should instead jump on the queues and community fragmentation that is WoW classic. And I almost did it.
---
I love hammer guardian so I'm definitely gonna try this out!
---
Dungeons, WvW and PvP were meant to be a substantial challenging part of the game at launch, it wasn't raids that added hard gameplay as dungeons were meant to be as hard a raids originally. The game still wanted to offer challenge and competitiveness, but also "respect your time".
---
Also, the combat system was designed to create competitive PvP and be easier to balance, as Anet wanted GW2 to be an eSport. WvW was a large part of the original endgame and had reasonable focus with WvW seasons.
---
Unfortunately, the game was rushed out before these parts were probably finished and didn't receive enough development post launch. Which is why we had HoT which attempted to fix these parts of the game.
---
As I said, if you actually looked at the original development for the Game, you would realise it never indented to be a singleplayer story fashion and collection simulator, but for some reason a certain part of the community has hijacked it to be so. 
---
GW2 shinies far more with its combat/skill systems, Challenging open world metas/world bosses WvW and skill based PvP than it does with open world story.
---
If you go to buy.guildwars2.com you can see by yourself : you just have to put your mouse on that text and it says the following :
---
&gt; Owners of Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire can play new Living World episodes as soon as they’re live. Upgrade your account now to prepare for the all-new Living World story, The Icebrood Saga, releasing September 17.
---
Basically it's how it worked until now : the purchase includes access to all the LS you have unlocked (but couldn't access due to not owning expansion) or will unlock (as long as you're here to get it while it's free).
---
&gt; Call me old school but regular looking armor is good enough for me
---
So the franchise died with GW1 chaos gloves?
---
just because you dont like something or someone doesnt mean they are dead.
---
You think it could be "for those who had patience and waited long enough" too?
---
Many big hits in raids actually hit for base damage that scales with health. Also, high toughness low vitality scales better with incoming healing.
---
I play quite a lot mesmer (wvw) / mirage (pve condi, wvw) / chrono (tank, wvw, support, power dps, low tank), and though I play with 8 ‘builds’, they only use 5 gear seats.
---
It's highly hypothetical. As far as I'm concerned, there are still a million ways this system could work and I'm waiting to see what we actually get. It's supposed to come "in the near future" so I prefer waiting rather than expecting one of the many possible outcomes.
---
I'm talking about mounts and all the new shit, those chaos gloves are a classic.
---
Man. I agree that Anet sorely misjudged expectations with this event, but am I really the only one reading comments like this thinking, 'What the fuck is wrong with y'all?'
---
After days of cleaning up a torrent of vitriol from the worst this community has to offer, a mod admits to feeling disillusioned about volunteering for the subreddit and is told they're part of the problem.
---
This has got to be trolling, right? Nobody could possibly be this unempathetic.
---
I'd buy that for a dollar...or 40.
---
Normal sense of pain is what comes to mind for me. You might be imortal and can't die but a lethal blow still hurts like hell. 
---
Maybe even dying itself could be painful, physically and mentally in the form of panic attacks and maybe even depression.
---
Your character might develop numbness to that pain and get used to it, loose emotions all together and frequently try to get into dangerous situations, just to be killed and feel something. 
---
Or they hate it and avoid being revived at all cost.
---
I think all of that would make for interesse character progression.
---
Anyway, hope inspiration finds it's way back to you :D
---
Soo..how about you don´t use mounts? Are they needed for core gw2? no they are not, so don´t use them there are they necessary for PoF and upwards? Yes only use them there.
---
Gaining distort only shares Aegis which is really important for certain moves like Gorse or Conjured Amalgamate's slams. It's pretty useless for the mentioned use case though: the damage taken when Vale Guardian's green circle mechanic is "failed"
---
Well considering all my buddies that used to play gw1 say gw2 is a dead game. I know most gw1 vets can say the same thing.
---
a timeline for future releases. realistically its not particularly useful, since they're often either vague or remain unfullfilled. people want them more for the assurance that certain things will come.
---
Thanks for sharing your opinion but I hated not having mounts.  It's a natural progression for MMOs to get to a mount system.  I have a 1070 GTX with an i7 ( 4th gen ) and I have zero issues with the game running.  It could be some process running in the background but only you know.  I do agree mounts ruined some vistas and JPs but I suck at JPs so therefore I hate them and am OK with it.
---
For someone with your username you’re not very intuitive.
---
Yes, there not requires for core but they with POF
---
Yes around 2017 something changed
---
Im curious on how Anet will respond to this.
---
LA is a constant frame drop, 20-50fps. I have a 9700k with a rtx 2080 and runs like crap. This game isnt optimized for newer systems
---
You dont need to pretend anything cause I most certainly didnt blame the players for anything. I only said that is anything is "killing" the game its by "some" of the community when creating a false narrative through hyperbole and sometimes plain untruth that could scare new players away. I never said anything about the state of the game primarily because for one i dont believe the game is in a bad place at all. For one revenue has been stable for a long long time hardly an indication of a game spiraling into oblivion like some seem to believe. 
---
That is not to say the game is perfect and nothing needs fixing of course, there is no doubt there are big area of definiticines. PvP and WvW most certainly need a lot more work and no one can deny raid cadence went down from 4 months to close to 9 months per release, not saying that at all but here is the thing, why is it that anet apply less resources to them then the living world? living world is most definitely more work than adding say a new pvp map, or even a new game mode. Likewise with raids, I have no doubt it take a lot less work making a new raid then a new living world episode, so why didnt anet decide to slow living world cadence compared to raid cadence for example? Is it possible that perhaps the community underestimates what the vast majority of players enjoy doing? Anet dont have to guess, they know how many players play each type of content, they know how many players they're loosing from each content type based on their decision. Do you think they would divert resources from the most popular content to support the least popular content? or is it more likely that some players just under estimate the popularity of content that doesnt resonate with them? Like you say and I quote " Most times the maps go dead within the first month ", I just poped quickly in bloodstone fern. middle of the day on a work day on a map that was added 38 months ago. Just went from 1 corner of the map to the other, like a whole 2 minutes experiment on what is probably the smallest map ever released and I counted 13 players not including me and thats assuming there were no other instances of that map, admitting thats very unlikely but its possible... even so 13 in the middle of the day on a workday on a map that hasnt been relevant for years say something and it certainly doesnt say the map is dead. But hey lets focus on what your statement tells someone who has never played guildwars 2, what do you think such a person understands when you say " Most times the maps go dead within the first month "? do you think they'll get that even at off peak hours they can expect other people to play with on maps that were released years ago ? or are they more likely to think maybe they'll get to see 13 people in prime time on the latest map that was released just 3 months ago? And tell me if you were planning to start a new mmo and you were just told you'd need to go through 7 years of content to finally get to maybe play with 13 people what are you going to do? hurry finish installing the game to get started or look from something more lively? 
---
Does Anet refuse to communicate or once again its a case of the community building the narrative they want to build? like there is a collective cry for a roadmap, well anet shared that in april, living world season 5, build templates, cooking level 500, legendary sigils and runes, wvw scoring changes, pvp festival, swiss torunament support etc.. yet here we are with lots of people acting like that never happened, so tell me what incentive do Anet have to communicate? say the wrong thing, get fired, defend the person that said the wrong thing get fired too. 
---
Besides this wasnt a Q&amp;A it was the reveal for season 5.
---
We knew for a long time that there would be no expansion before season 5.
---
What? Charr Homelands and Far Shiverpeaks were GW1 areas
---
Its a shame since Cantha would've brought a lot of freshness to the game
---
You do realize we're 3 days from a new league right, so player numbers rocket up again, as it has done every leaguestart since 2016.
---
But you do you mate.
---
Yeah but map design in POF was changed to compensate for mounts.  Seriously, in Desolation or Vabbi you would find it fun fighting to get to your  destination? I doubt that
---
ggg is in an unique position because they've been very involved with the community since the beginning, they're seen as the "little guys" (even though the tencent acquisition kinda shattered that) and have no competition on the market leading to pretty much guaranteed success. its very easy to come on the stage when everyone's going to clap for you. theres a reason why in bad leagues and in general after the first 2-3 weeks barely any dev communicates anymore.
---
and even when they do fuck up, takes a lot to piss away the good will. though im sure older players remember the xbox announcement, 3.0 release and league and other points in the game's history where they were radio silent.
---
Lol no
---
I lack object permanence so if I can't see it it doesn't exist.

FFXIV is for weebs.

My berserker is ready to celebrate  [https://i.imgur.com/YAvcgg3.png](https://i.imgur.com/YAvcgg3.png)

That's a visualization of the intended development of the game, with most of the time approximate release date.
---

---
They could name it something like "waterbrood saga" and I would be totally ok with it.
---
They won't. They will wait for the 17. for it to blow over and hope that people will like the Prologue and forget about the controversy.
---
Sold!
---
You have no idea of what toxic means, but you should look it up. I only answer threads I'm interested in or at least I only reply to statements that I have an interest in. If I perceive someone spreading falsehoood I'm going to answer it. Deal with it.
---
The bottom line is there are many many raid threads I don't post in, but not being happy with raids doesn't give you the right to make up shit about the game, and yes, I'll always call that out.
---
I'll post in threads about easy mode raids, for example. You don't get to be the ultimate arbiter in what threads anyone should post in, nor do you understand what motivates me to post. In fact, it's clear from your words that you have no understanding of why I post it all. It doesn't surprise me. 
---
I won't be replying to your posts again, because this is nothing more than trolling and a personal attack. I'm sorry I wasted time replying in the first place.
---
Didn’t they say it would be free?
---
Because he likes the one thing and does not like the other - he defines the standard of what is good and what not!
---
Thanks for reminding me to preorder the Aurene Funko Pop.
---
I remember people complaining about a dev called Izzy everytime there was a balance patch.
---
I would be pleasantly surprised. I don’t remember hearing that - atleast not during the 45 minute show.
---
i do remember those issues but they were fixed pretty quick (in under 6 months time) and there was alot of discussion on forums and on social media, as the gw1 team was reachable for such stuff. 
---
the state of gw2 seems to be the same since round about 2 years from what i could gather
---
If it damages ANET's game, they might actually have to do something about it, if they want to keep their jobs.
---
I think that if there is desire for that, there should be easy way to submit it on pages like FromFansForFans and let it be made and sold. Anet heavily advertises those initiatives and that's half of what they even on firday event presented through merchandise section.
---
I do have a GW2Efficiency account, good idea!
---
Where can I see old login rewards though?
---
Why didn't it happen when they did that? My queue was steadily decreasing since sat/sun not last wed. there were still huge queues then
---
So because most of the community of kill the easier bosses, the game is too easy? That's kind of a broken statement lol.
---
Look, I fully understand the last two raid wings were easier then most, and there's no reward for repeating challenge modes, a lot of bosses can have similar underlying mechanics, etc etc. I also have no problem with harder raids or anything really, it's all great. I mean, how about we get actual raids first, but yeah.
---
But I really think you're not being objective here about the difficulty of raids for the whole populace. I don't know the guild tag, I've been out of the game for two years, but I'm assuming it's prestigious or something. If so, you can definitely be objective about your peer circle. But, especially considering the hyperbole and backwardness of the statement you made, well lol.
---
this hurts so bad and it looks soooo good. man
---
&gt; And ofcourse it does not say it is set in stone, things can change or shift according to need and demand.
---
And that line is the issue here. This community does not understand that, and thus as soon as something changes or gets moved back all hell breaks loose, which is why they don't even bother with it anymore.
---
If you wanted anything other than mindless fluff and carebears telling eachother how friendly they are within their safespace then this sub has always been terrible. It's not as bad as the forums but it's been going ever so closer.
---
Negativity and toxicity are a reaction to  this illusion of fluff and positivity.
---
Wow 4000 gems for $25 is great, I'd be all over that deal!
---
You bring a good point about the visual direction this game took or the lack of it. It just looks tacky these days with all the particle effects on outfits, mounts, skins etc. Sure there were always some flashy skins and legendary weapons but it's at korean f2p mmo stage now. The game doesn't look good when there is a crowd, world bosses look a clown fest. People have been asking for an option to turn down these effects in vain.
---
All content updates, features and QoL improvements continue to be given for free with no monthly subscription fee.
---
If you noticed from the event, episode 1 and 2 are happening in the same map and it sounded like they wanted multiple episodes happening in one map so maybe 3 and 4 get a map and 5 and 6 get one. If this is the case I am hoping that they put in the time to make these detailed like expansion maps.
---
Hmm but what about bank access? Character bag slots? Character slots? All of those would fit under the “Features and QOL”. I may be wrong here.
---
The other thing I’d be scared of getting say one template per character for free and paying 400 gems for another slot? I feel like that’s quite plausible.
---
Oh I know. I very much disagree with her sentiment there because I think TB's involvement in gamergate was a lot more nuanced than most people made it out to be. But I agree with her sentiment on a lot of other things, including the statements she made that kicked off the whole drama last year. Everyone vastly overreacted to something that really wasn't that bad and harassed Anet until they unjustly fired her and another colleague that was caught in the crossfire.
---
Someone actually suggested "have you tried using branching dialogue" to someone whose career is a narrative designer. It's like suggesting a baker try kneading bread when they have a problem with it. Then she made a perfectly valid point about people's assumptions of women in the games industry, a point that has been backed up by countless people's experiences. But merely mentioning anything about women in the games industry is enough to awaken a hoard of angry gamers and the rest is history.
---
That's indeed a population that would lean towards FFXIV over WoW.
---
No? 
---
There have never been any offical active player numbers released for either of the games. And while they did indeed announce 6 million copies sold of GW1, they have also mentioned the numbers 11 million accounts for GW2. The first half a year of GW2 sold 3 million copies alone, so the claim that it has only sold 5 million copies in total is very very unlikely.

Good for you if you found an MMO that caters to your needs. GW2 probably isn't and it's fine
---
Which one? Hot had order backpacks and an exalted one, as far as I remember.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuRabZXglaQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuRabZXglaQ) this is how I feel now
---
Don't let yourself be gaslit. The upset people are the minority on reddit. Most people are happy with the game.
---
Feel free to enjoy the things you want 😉
---
This is exactly how I think build templates should work. Let's wait and see.
---
i certainly can see justifications for the opinion that gw2 died with PoF, including (certain) mount skins. i however don't see how mounts themselves can be twisted into such.
---
The title reminds me of an old GW 1 big in the The Wilds mission... that bonus was a a bitch.
---
On one hand I think that Anet should do this kind of event for every season. They should actually market the game like this and not rely on word of mouth. 
---
I also understand that the community was used to bare minimum in regards of marketing and so they expected much more. Hell, Anet did only the prerecorded 20-minute rebroadcast announcement for PoF and that was an expansion! 
---
On another hand they emphasized multiple times that this event will deal with the Living Story and I'd accept that as an argument for why they haven't touched on some subjects if they did really present only story. But they decided to talk about other features, even pvp or wvw. Despite that most of it was vague AF, at least we got a rough idea what they intend to do with them. Completely omitting the raids and fractals was inexusable then IMO. Especially when they rather spent remaining 15 minutes of the 45-minute event to talk about merchandise.
---
I don't have problem with what I've seen. I'm happy that the Charr and Norn will finally get more focus. I'm looking forward to Far Shiverpeaks and snowy maps that are my favorite. I find the Strikes to have a potential to be a great addition to the game if they'll have decent rewards and will really motivate people to go raid. PvP and WvW should IMO get more because they felt neglected for quite some time but at least they got a promise of something. 
---
What I have problem with is what was not talked about.  For many people this event was a dealbreaker. And deciding to be silent about some big topics was a mistake. Vagueness didn't help either. We don't have an idea how this SAGA will pan out. We don't even know whether it will have a set cadence or what to expect besides the new story and maps. We don't know what Anet's plans are for the future really. For the immediate future maybe, Prologue on the 17. with a new map, Episode 1 and 2 after with another one. But many people are still in the dark. Will there be new fractal or raid content? Are there plans for an expansion-like features like elite specs or new progressions? 
---
A roadmap would do miracles in this case. Be frank with us even if you'd tell us that you're done with development of some feature/mode. Most of the community is pretty understanding if provided with a normal reason and honesty goes a long way. 
---
And FFS stop focusing on the 0.0001% that's toxic. Stop giving them platform. And stop throwing the whole community together with them and dismissing all criticism as toxic. Talk to us. Both the community and Anet want GW2 to prosper. So let's talk, let's provide good feedback, let's be honest with each other. If we'll know what to expect, we'll be ale to tamper our expectations which will not only give you a more happy community but also a more understanding community.
---
 "Get the most out of"  would be people with legendary runes/sigils because you wouldn't need 5+ armor sets in your bags.  I think that is what they mean, convience of bag space.
---
Certain elements of players are less happy than other elements of players. I'm more of an open world, story player, I spend a ton of time in game, but I'm not a raider, or a hard core PvPer or WvWer and I'm quite happy with the game. Of course, a lot of people happy aren't posting here, they're busy playing. I post here because I have two monitors and I have downtime between doing stuff with my guild.
---
But yeah,. the game is in good shape for most casual players, particularly new casual players. I wouldn't worry about it.
---
Here's the thing about truths: You are entitled to your own opinions. You are not entitled to your own facts.
---
Why should I post the answer if there are already three here or do you need four explanations until you understand it?
---
Click on Account and just try to search in that searchbar at top. The last reward is "Chest of Loyalty". If you opened it somehow, you might not find it though. The previous reward is "Bag of Experience" and contains just 4 tomes of knowledge, so that might not be big deal.
---
There is Time Machine under the Account section as well. It should have snapshots from previous days. You then can compare your account at two points in time and see what you gained through last two days. If you opened the loyalty chest, there will be either difference in laurels, vision crystals, mystic clovers, or tomes of knowledge (but who would pick tomes from this).
---
okay, thanks. So how do i get diviner then cheap/fast? :D
---
ah thanks :)
---
So how do i get diviner stuff cheap and fast then? :/
---
if you truly did not play and had 2 days left, then the last reward you got should have been a bag of transmutation charges. if you consumed that, you should see a bump for that [here](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/statistics/statistics.transmutationCharges)
---
Remember that you're looking at a quick clip of content that isn't scheduled to be done for several more months, which means they very likely still need to go through polishing it.
---
Yes, they should have polished before showing a preview at a big event. I don't, and can't, know what happened to cause this.
---
All these people asking for armor. Confirmed massive spikes of ice on shoulder pieces.
---
GW2 isn't really a huge time investment compared to literally any other mmorpg. Thats why veterans are salty. Nothing to do after 10k+ hours.
---
I am a veteran. It is more alive than ever. It is. Matter of point odlf view
---
"A bit disappointed" is my take too, but still some cool stuff coming so I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
---
This subreddit is in a perpetual state of doomsday though many times, it gets tiring.
---
What's the alternative? You get a new grindable instance that you can mindlessly farm 20h a day to get a shiny effect on your armor?
---
Give me lore and day of the week
---
Cool. Sounds like it’s working then. If Anet wants that juicy fresh blood then they need to address the vets. That’s for confirming it’s effectiveness.
---
This isn't a major release though. It's apples to oranges.
---
You're getting free story, maps and miniraids. For free. Just because
---
Except there's never been any confirmation GW2 has the FULL resources of ArenaNet.
---
1. NCSoft said ArenaNet cancelled some unannounced projects. This does not mean they cancelled all of them.
---
2. Canceling unannounced projects doesn't stop a studio from starting new unannounced projects.
---
3. Mike Z said the GW2 team welcomed back some familiar faces. He never said all the staff from canceled projects have moved to GW2.
---
From the looks of it, it still looks minimally staffed or comically mismanaged or both. But any assumption that GW2 is getting all the manpower of ArenaNet is very likely wrong.
---
GIMME GIMME
---
Only two healers I haven't played in GW2 are heal scourge and tempest. Heal scrapper is by the far the most fun healer to play. Where it lacks in buffs and (to an extent) boons, it has a huge library of utility.
---
Need massive condi cleanse? Med Kit 3 (up to twenty conditions); Elixir Gun 3 (up to twenty-five conditions); Purge Gyro (up to twenty-five conditions); Cleansing Synergy; and comboing with Purge Gyro, Elixir Gun 5, and Elite Mortar Kit 4; to name the main options. That's up to seventy condition cleanses within a span of five seconds before even considering the light field combos. And if that's not impressive enough, then the Purity of Purpose trait converts conditions that would be cleansed, into boons. Scrapper is obscenely OP at Slothasor and Soulless Horror for this reason.
---
Need massive healing? Honestly, the list of options is so lengthy that I can't be bothered to list them all out.
---
Need damage reduction? Over Shield, Reconstruction Enclosure, Bulwark Gyro, Impact Savant (which combos well with Damage Dampener), and Defense Field, to name the main options.
---
Need reflects? Magnetic Shield and Experimental Turrets.
---
Need CC? I'm not even sure where to begin. We're talking about engineers here!
---
Need party-wide stealth? Sneak Gyro and Toss Elixir S.
---
I could go on and on about other utility that it can bring, but I'm sure that you get the idea. People love to talk shit about heal scrapper, but I'm almost certain that none of them have actually tried it. It's incredible at what it does. But people tend to think that few offensive buffs/boons means bad support, which simply isn't necessarily true.
---
There is no discussion. If you disagree your post gets hidden thanks to the avalanche of downvotes you get
---
It's noon 'n all so nut much action but there's [not a single 250 LI](https://imgur.com/a/ZVOTENe) lfg up on EU atm
---
There are more than enough trainings available, people just refuse to look for them or make their own
---
If only there were as good at anything else...
---
it actually does not. it does only refer to accounts in general and not sold copies.
---
for reference go on the wiki and read it. there is also a citation from the article from eurogamer after gw2 went free to play
---
&gt; Someday you'll realize that the same people that do raids are also doing other contents in the game,
---
They are, probably, but *also* there are about 8-9 times as many players who do the other contents of the game and *don't* raid. Raiders might dabble in everything, but very very few players bother with raiding at all. So if you make content for open world stuff, *everyone* can do it.
---
I bought POF from dlgamer a while ago and got the HOT content when I logged in yesterday.
---
&gt; This community does not understand that, and thus as soon as something changes or gets moved back all hell breaks loose, which is why they don't even bother with it anymore. 
---
It would be less of a problem if there were communication about delays and changes in plan. Believe it or not, people understand not everything will always go to plan and will be content to wait for a good product. If I recall, Pokemon Sword/Shield was initially scheduled to launch early summer but got pushed back and people were fine with that because there was communication on it. (If it wasn't Pokemon Sword/Shield it was some other switch game)
---
I found Sea of Sorrow to be really enjoyable. Ghost of ascalon was ok.
---
But yeah EoD was meh.
---
Holy fuck dude, thats WP levels of information put into my brain for the one sentence i made
---
You made me interested in them, no matter how much my krytan heart hates them haha
---
It's still here. Still proud.
---
Maybe that could justify making the maps bigger and having more unique new assets being created for them, as well as filling them with more stuff to do.
---
I've been using the profession artwork as desktop backgrounds for a long time and it was always really difficult to find high resolution/quality versions of them. I would absolutely love a way to buy proper prints of them.

They do the prints but for like $150-300 depending on size
---
Yes, from FOUR YEARS ago. With TWO expansions being released after that. So you are honestly claiming that they didn't sell a single version of ANY of the two expansions? 
---
We get it, you love GW1, but can't you at least try to be honest with your comments? 
---
Still waiting for where I can "look it up" (it is after all YOUR job to prove your claims, not mine)
---
Jumping puzzles might be one of my Favorit additions to the sequel… but at least about the worst part we agree… although there was /jump...
---
Except that there have been situations where things have been pushed back and ArenaNet were quite open about that. And yet the moment we were told all hell broke loose.
---
As far as I know the balance team only works on balance a couple of weeks before each balance patch. They are in other teams for the rest of the time.
---
or just get gold and farm the TP for less effort and more return.
---
I NEVER said "FULL resources of ArenaNet". I am clearly speaking of the full dev resources devoted to GW2 (the "four teams" they mentioned during the announcement).   
---
One of the possible conclusion one can get out of the disappointing amount of features and content announced is, indeed, that those "four teams" are actually understuffed because some people are devoted to other project. Another possibility would be that those teams are seriously mismanaged. Or that they abruptly changed their development plans at some point. Hence, the worry about the weak development power I meantion.   
---
Just do not put in my mouth something I never said, please.
---
We do do bluffs a few times :), basicly every map we do now and then ^^
---
Because raids with low requirements and "people like him" are complete shitfests, and they know it.
---
We have at least 5 blog posts while the league is active and several patches and hotfixes and if there are severe bugs the devs or the CM makes a thread about it, explaining the situation and the date of the upcoming patch.
---
If wishes were fishes.
---
Ah, alright so you are saying that Prophecies itself sold over 5 million copies then? Because I am quite sure that they do count all the sales from Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall AND Eye of the North in those numbers. Of course hard to know since you refuse to actually supply the actual source for your information. And no saying: "Yeah it is in an article!!" is not supplying a source. 
---
You didn't give me any links whatsoever, you simply talked about things. And no, I didn't fin anything for you, I found the picture I linked. Which was directly from ArenaNet, not some random article.
---
I'll agree the marketing is terrible.  I remember seeing sidebar ads for GW2 that had a quaggan holding a sign [here it is](http://i.imgur.com/b1BAepr.jpg) and all I could think of was "this would only resonate with dedicated players who even know what Quaggan are"
---
Still playing
---
I have no recollection of anything like that. Could you provide an example?
---
[^_^](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPzhgPpTCNQ)
---
move on to what, though? if you look at GW2's rapsheet over this 7 year period, do we really trust them enough for a third installment? even further, do they even trust themselves? And what does Ncsoft think, considering they laid off 35% of Anets workforce? 
---
I dont wanna be a doomsday bringer, but looking at it rationally, gw 2 might very well be the last installment we'll ever see in the franchise.
---
making a completely new IP is a VASTLY different beast compared to making updates for an existing game for as long as the are able to. personally, considering all the headaches for them that has been gw 2 for this 7 year run, i dont even think they're discussing a new IP (gw3).
---
their concerns lie with staying alive and continuing to secure revenue for GW 2.
---
developing a entirely new IP takes a considerable amount of budget.
---
Another possibility to think on is if the build/gear templates will be able to automatically use (Endless) Upgrade Extractors. If yes then it both makes more money for Anet with people either buying lots of extractors from the gem store or buy the endless one via the tp (or get super lucky with blc) and makes build/gear templates even more convenient.
---
I have no time to train. It is a game. If I wanted a game hard to master I'd be playing monster hunter or dark soul. They did well with fractals: do you want hard content ? T4 . Otherwise lower tiers grant less currency .
---
Raids were not supposed to be in gw2 . They said at the beginning
---
Adding was an error which split the community
---
It is nice watching community run events like fashion shows and ERP go on. Its also nice that I can kind of go my own way, do my own thing, and do the vast majority of the content at my own pace, my own time, and by myself if I want. 
---
But thinking of it this way makes me just a little sad. The combat in this game is too good to be just a means to an end. Even npc and mob fights (especially in the crystal desert) show how great and well tuned fighting is in the game. It can even make gold meta farming interesting to a point and not make it feel like a death march (\*cough, EVE online high sec mission/mining).
---
&gt; Honestly I don't mind merchandise, but where's the good merchandise?
---
Just think about the in-game possibility to order a 3d-printed and painted model of your character in a pose of your choice - kind of like a snapshot. Unused possibilities...
---
there are blog posts here and there sure, but lets not get ahead of ourselves here. for how long have they ignored multistrike last league? how long did it take to address and fix all those cancel animation bugs? or lets go further back, were you around for bestiary? prophecy? when the only time they came on the sub was for critical stuff, and big concerns were never or extremely slowly addressed. or the many other cases....
---
ggg are very good, but not gods amongst men. especially during harbinger they were super quiet, when everyone was complaining about the unfinished acts and lack of new endgame.
---
I don't think it's any different. You couldn't play LW3 or 4 without the relative expansion either.
---
You can check many of them here:

https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF
---
Now that HoT is bundled with PoF, you would get Core, Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire in one go.
---
Second set of Legendary Weapons.
---
Jumping puzzles were fun little things to discover until they decided to make them borderline impossible to figure out unless you looked it up.
---
It's pretty ridiculous. Years and years old content that people will be super confused about when they start HoT.
---
Idk about that. We already have a bunch of elite specs that arent playable, or only in specific situations in specific modes. Throwing more onto the pile wont really help. I mean, sure, Id love to see an elite spec that allows thief to be an actually good duelist in exchange for not being able to use both shortbow and an actual damage weapon, but if they cant even make deadeye functional outside of a cheese build that shouldnt exist, why should they be able to do that?
---
Yeah, no idea what they were thinking. Probably that we'd take their announcement of the announcement literally.
---
you are still missing the point but there you go:
---
gw1 sold copies:
---
Guildwars.com Press Release, Guild Wars Surpasses Six Million Units Sold". Cite web requires |website= (help). Note that units sold does not equate to number of players, and, because Guild Wars accounts never expire, there is no notion of "active account" as used by other MMORPG companies.

gw2 sold copies:
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-08-27-arenanet-explains-guild-wars-2-going-free-and-the-addition-of-raids
---
directly from the wikipedia page for guild wars. also i will cite the wiki itself (even though its not a scientific citation):
---
 In April 2009, NCSoft announced that 6 million units of games in the Guild Wars series had been sold.[9] The sequel, Guild Wars 2, was announced in March 2007 and released on August 28 2012. It features updated graphics and gameplay mechanics, and continues the original Guild Wars tradition of no subscription fees.[10] The Guild Wars series had sold 11.5 million copies by August 2015.[11][12]
---
Its again a faceroll atm
---
I still have tons of compost I got from the foods I made while leveling characters to cook 500. I did it first in my main to get the story and home instance unlocks, then on my cook, then on my home instance gatherer.
---
Really wish the gw1 format was used a lot more. Very fond memories going through missions (+ bonus of course).
---
The team play and variety was top notch. Story and exploration was great. I dont get why people are so against instanced content when that content usually winds up being better than anything open world imo.
---
ded gaem
---
I was levelling last night and found it difficult to find somewhere there wasn’t a group of other people
---
I can say one thing: I and friends of mine would be playing a lot less Guild Wars 2 some if at all if raids weren't a thing. I also wouldn't be buying the housing garden plots if it was only for fractals. Additionally, raids are a great addition to a game like Guild Wars 2. They should go more out of the way to force certain play styles at certain bosses. The meta needs to be shaken up in my opinion so that other traits get to be useful as well.
---
I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, the story of the Charr Homelands might be interesting. On the other hand, the existing Charr lands are my least favorite parts of the games. The "perma autumn" color scheme and steampunk blackiron construction is the least appealing to me. The shots they showed so far look no different than Dissidia\* Plateau. 
---
 \*(sic)
---
maybe im wrong but i remember it from pre launch as well. it was together with other overzealous bullshit, like no mounts and stuff.
---
Chalice of tears was horrible.
---
I'm talking about comparing a simple merchandise and a whole expension.
---
Thanks a lot, really concise answer. I usually care about story, but the personal story was really bad in my opinion, so I thought the rest was the same
---
It says i'm right since people actually agree and even people known to heavily defend ArenaNet like WP are also disappointed at how badly this was all handled.
---
Good attempt at trying to paint me in a bad light though, kinda proves me right that all you guys try to do is divert attention.
---
Any friends that would be interested in GW2 tried it a long time ago and won’t come back.
---
But I will give it a shot, play the stories in order, maybe they get better
---
I gave up on that and set up Bootcamp. Performance is night and day.
---
I am around, no they aren't.
---
You're one of the main guys actively sucking up to ANet, so of course you'd say that.
---
And GW2 efficency requires you to MANUALLY go there and add yourself, which not even remotely close to everyone would do, just like how not everyone would use reddit. Basing your premise on that is thus quite silly. 
---
You are making comments about numbers all the time and yet you don't actually have any recent numbers to supply. You are also using completely unfair comparisions to try and get your point across.
---
Oh, then I'll go remove the upvote I gave you.
---
The merch they literally mentioned is a hyperbolic symbol of the whole presentation, and should not be taken literally or on it's own.
---
Levelling was a chore but max level is considerably better than wow, coming from a mythic raider on wow for years, I absolutely love savage and ultimate raids in ff
---
It’s a bit mixed. You’re missing Season 1 so Season 2 makes no goddamn sense without doing some digging. HoT actually is pretty decent story wise but is paced terribly by game mechanic requirements. Season 3 is a bit of a mixed bag of story quality. PoF is actually really damn good as far as story goes. Season 4 is sort of split into two parts effectively and, other than one minor issue that was the subject of the last community outrage, is a solid story
---
they have resources, they just dont know how to manage it. im pretty sure everyone still remembers the aug 30,2019 fiasco.  why waste money for something so useless.
---
Awesome read!
---
Anyway, I'll be a pessimist for a second and say that I don't expect any references to LS1, or the "breeding farms" or anything very deep. I expect Flame Legion to come to Grothmar Valley with their new Imperator that will maybe look for a new powerful source of magic (i.e. Jormag)or maybe just be there to support the anti-treaty opinions now that Kralk hasbeen dealt with. I don't expect Flame Legion to play a huge role, IMO the focus will be more on Blood Legion and Rytlock.
---
had the best time in this game :) knew all the missions by heart and could lead any group through them. Never found such a group of people to play with again. Still miss it :)
---
MARA alliance on EU .. still miss all the old players
---
Why you are doing this to me! WHHYYYYY!!!
---
;)
---
1. You mean to tell me that there are not threads of new people asking whether starting to play is worth it right now every single day? Oh please. Take a look at the new tab on any day and you will always find them.
---
2. Nonsense, I actually thoroughly critisized the tacky merch sale section that was where the climax of the announcement was supposed to be. I simply also speak out against the abuse coming from some in the community.
---
3. Also: not a guy.
---
 I do T4 and did all the lower tier hell but still if I wnat to run a T1 with a suboptimal build with an alt I can
---
 This is not doable in raids with lfg. Do you want people to raid ? Change difficult like in fractal. Same drops different % different quantity of currency. Dot.
---
It's only been happening since the last patch, to my knowledge? "Some time" I think is a wee bit of an exaggeration.
---
That said, it's not the *first* time this bug has happened, so what's more impressive is the fact it has once again re-surfaced and has done so in a weirdly minor patch that really shouldn't have broken it in the first place.
---
sorry did you just cite Orr, vanilla game content, as difficult?
---
HoT and PoF are harder than base game open world (and even then, they're not that hard once you learn some particularly pesky moves of the mobs)
---
and what the fuck is "Try again with greens"? even casuals have at least rares, maybe even exotics, both of which are way easy to get compared to ascended.
---
All I want is to get dual classes back :( or things like 55hp monks, perma Assassins and all those fun shenanigans
---
Yes, all the plushies!
---
Well, it depends on how much you have the game running daily.
---
For some 3 days can be over 10 hours, for others that time won't even be 1 hour.
---
Cannot find after 7 years but it was the reason I left wow so I remember it very well
---
Yeah, what the hell is this crap. They should fire every dev that worked on this project...😂
---
Lfg beg to dissent with you. They should make it like for fractals : easy content for 5 with less currency and maybe no item drop ( u should buy items with currency) and harder difficult with % drop.
---
I really wish to know how many ppl really raid compared the whole population. We had this statistic all this would finish in a second
---
Oh u can do whatever I do not fell forced to raid in gw2 and this is why I am here but still I think all this toxicity about them not releasing a wing a week is stupid and raid is not and should not be the core of the game
---
Anet has two options:
---
1. have a backlash for lack of info as they only reveal stuff they are 100% sure about
---
2. have a backlash for postponing, cancelling or changing a feature that was planned
---
Idk about everyone else, but I find the situation nr. 2 a bit better as it is overall more hopeful and you at least have an idea of what to expect, as opossed to no idea at all.
---
Toxic casuals are genuinely a thing though.
---
You know... an expansion dealing with underwater themes doesn't necessarily have to contain underwater combat. Recently in WoW:BFA and FFXIV:ShB they got around that by using plot devices to remove all the water in what would have otherwise been underwater zones (Nazjatar and The Tempest respectively) and turn them into land zones.
---
There was so much more class diversity and ridiculous builds

Is that enough for you? These are all with a single search term, all from the last two weeks (but all older than the announcement since **obviously** every poste interested in the game that is newer was made by a paid Anet bot. /s
---
False
---
i cant wait to get back to the northern shiverpeaks. maybe not for long and we can go back deep unter the mountains into the depths of tyria and find some dwarfs still fiighting. we weakened primordius, maybe they are turning the tide slowly again. we still did not have a whole lot of destroyers coming from the entrances to the depths. there is still a chance.
---
hold on dwarfen friends. we are coming
---
Nice to know. I thought I started lacking common sense or something. I really don't understand the magnitude of the backlash.
---
I do understand the discomfort and that there would be some backlash. What I don't understand is the magnitude of it.
---
switch stats of any ascended gear in the mystic forge
---
I'm just here for player housing. Waiting since launch. Please let me customize my home instance!
---
&gt; My guess is that they knew the announcement would be a let down, but also knew that it would've been worse to not do it.  
---
I think that if they didn't do it, and just released a trailer+blog post they would have pushed the big backlash to at least the release of episode 1. Which would have simmered slowly instead of exploding. And then they would have more time to half-ass a road map of vague features we knew about since last year.  
---
Hell, if they just called it 'intruduction panel for new players' instead of an announcement it wouldn't have exploded as much.
---
As someone who has played a lot of both: No. Just no.
---
Imo they get.
---
Also one more thing. Whenever a story will take you to a new map, remember that only story hero can access it. 
---
To get other heroes there (to maximize farming) instead of doing story for them you have two options:
---
* Use teleport to friend item.
---
* Buy permanent portal scrolls with your first hero.
---
All maps of ls3,4 have a vendor that sells portals and books to keep them in one place.
---
Of course, and that's why the games dead, so good job kiddo, you ruined a game.
---
I personally think Silverwastes and maybe even Drytop are better quality than some of the PoF maps. Certainly better quality than the S4 maps. The S2 maps used the model they suggested for the S5 maps - revisit a map from a previous release, expand on it if necessary. It worked really well with Silverwastes.
---
You wont find much empathy in this thread. Half of these people didn't even read the article. This sub is a shit show right now and best left alone no matter which side of the argument you are on.
---
The people who stick around playing a game that is constantly declining in quality to show that they're better than those fans who quit.
---
My 80 bucks couldn't be gone fast enough!
---
I've seen this gif a million times and never thought to ask - wtf is going on with the people lying on the floor? What are they *doing*?
---
&gt; Then again I've also been gone since the last season ended.
---
And that's the crux. We all know that GW2 can't survive off people playing for 5 hours every 3-4 months. We don't want the game to die a miserable, slow death. If all ANet does is release some story and a new map every so often... I fear for the future.
---
Mad? No.
---
Disappointed? Probably.
---
I don't need Guild Wars 2 60FPS. I'm fine with 30FPS in most cases. 
---
I don't have a 4K monitor so I don't care.
---
DX12 won't make a big difference visually. Also, ArenaNet probably knows best how many people play on a system older than Windows 10. Don't discriminate. Except if you want to finance all the people who can't play Guild Wars 2 then.
---
I don't mind a performance improvement, especially of the network code. Would make WvW more fun.
---
You clearly didnt give it much playtime in that 30 days cause the game is about as far from kill 10 rats as GW2 is. They do that for literally the first job quest you get at level 1 to teach you how to push your buttons, and then there are a few of those kinda of quests during the story, but no different to GW2. What do you think renown hearts are? They are just kill quests by a different name lmao, kill 10 enemies and the bar fills, RH are no different to kill quests unless you think running around clicking on bales of hay or some shit is more exciting that kill quests.
---
what if! You stopped creating worthless garbage threads.
---
Wait.. Why would people want an underwater expansion? Everyone always says how much they hate underwater combat.
---
They definitely do. In this case I’d recommend Season 2 as well. The Central Tyria mastery points can be really painful, and Season 2 offers 8 really easy points, plus it’s much better than the base story. It really only improves from there.
---
2 years of no content, even for the casual, in return for a minor at best perfromance upgrade... 
---
Why would anyone be mad at that, lmao
---
He’s got namesakes and shrines— he’s absolutely still relevant in gw2 :)
---
I find it much better too. Even in something as tame as GW2, you still feel like your competing with other players constantly to tag mobs, etc. I like using my mount to travel around the maps, but really dislike the combat engages they have. Especially in pre-80 zones where a raptor leap can almost one shot a group of enemies. If one person is mounting and doing that in events in core Tyria zones, it really sucks the fun out of it for people playing the game normally or the ones that don't have mounts.
---
Why won't they have new assets?
---
.....did i say he mentioned Rubi or did i say the fucking words
---
&gt; ***are also disappointed at how badly this was all handled.*** 
---
I'm fucking done, you people love to cherry pick what to bitch and moan about just to push your narrative, go be brainless somewhere else.
---
Some classes are way more fun underwater than others, and it's been that way since launch.  However I imagine if they released an underwater explanation then they'd spend a lot of time balancing that.
---

CATCH A RIIIIIIIIIDE
---
Stop the drugs, PLEASE.
---
Arcdps isn't a superior option for build templates.
---
That isn’t how time works, 3 days is 3 days.
---
&gt; But once the market crashes, its not really worth "exploiting" anymore but by then, the market is destroyed anyways and wont fix itself unless Anet steps in.
---
Given only a small segment of the player population even cares about this, doesn't matter either way.
---
I play pretty much every part of this game except for Raiding, and for those who Raid, I think it is fair to expect higher costs given you are going to min/max, etc.
---
But for 5 player fractals, even CMs, what is the point of dropping a feast, even if just for your own use?  To get 66% life steal or 10% reduction in damage?  Who cares about the extra karma, gold or magic find?  For about the same cost (about 40s or so) a power DPS player can get the important stats, and all the materials are farmable in game, with no RNG or time gating.
---
This "exploit" is the only reason someone like me is even going to bother with this.  My wife's toon will harvest 4 peppercorn seeds for me per day, and then I might even drop a feast every day when I log in to WvW.  If I had to go through the time and effort to grow these seeds for each use, would probably only keep the feasts for when they have double XP weeks where we all go full PPT and that 10% XP buff has value.  For everything else in this game that I do, regular food is just fine.
---
Lets not forget that 2 years ago after pof they decided to no work on an expansion.
---
i read that as Abed
---
I didnt want to make this post about me but rather about the fact that raids are full auto mode at this point for most of the raiding community.Raids turned into what daily t4+cm runs are,and whether you do it with a guild/static or trough lfg its no difference.I wish arenanet found a way to make the hardest content of the game more than a weekly grind and also give a meaning to raids other than getting legendary gear,also adding a proper community hub for not just raiders but a hub that has activities and events that you can enjoy with other people because every sort of hub that exists in the game is filled with crafting/banks and just doesnt feel like a place that is meant for when you want to spend time with your friends or make new ones.
---
This is true.  Social platforms are a blessing and a curse.  It is great to be able to interact with the community but it makes groups of like minded people seem disproportionately large and can quickly develop echo chambers.
---
I’m happy with state of the game.  There are some annoyances as with all games, but when trying other MMOs I always find myself missing the GW2 things that make it great.
---
I have a sub with GW2, every 2 months I buy €10 worth of gems (800). That's a €5 sub/month. At least that's how I see it.
---
This is out in two weeks mate.
---
Nobody said otherwise. 
---
3 days is 3 days, yes.
---
But time is relative.
---
Both in physics and in psychology.
---
Makes no sense because Grothmarr is a GW1 map and the twitter link is actually showing a location that is so similar to one in GW1 it might be the same place. Drakkar, the dragon champion who corrupted Svanir (a GW1 character) and the world boss from episode 2, is actually seen in GW1, frozen beneath a lake.
---
I guarantee you this season will be full of GW1 nostalgia, just EotN nostalgia, not Factions.
---
Basically everything they've show so far from the new areas was made out of old assets combined with very few new ones. They've done this before with ls3 and are probably going to to the same here because it's a lot cheaper.
---
I think a restructuring of the edge of the mists would be a positive addition to the game for WvW content. Maybe new rewards the use of mounts the ability for squad joins for maps.
---
&gt;The optimist in me likes to believe that elite specs were planned for S5 but, due to the layoffs, they pulled them and started work on the next expansion which would include them.
---
The realist in me believes they weren't planning jack since it was already confirmed they were pulling resources AWAY from GW2 before the layoffs, not into it.
---
I say that as someone who has played a lot of both, too. Limited skill bar, fluent class restraints, combat focused around skills you find on enemies and energy management. Instanced maps, where you often want to kill all enemies. Small hubs where you meet other players. *No jumping*.
---
The most significant differences are itemization and solo focus. GW1 has always been compared to Diablo 2, and PoE is essentially Diablo 2's spiritual successor.
---
&gt;We already have a bunch of elite specs that arent playable
---
What?
---
hah - we are going to need a bigger pyramid!
---
I think everyone should not be so hard on the developers... After 7 great years we got a free tee shirt and a glider!
---
The first point is highly unlikely. I believe the devs said Dragonfall is literally the largest/most detailed map they can put in the game. That's why it's an ugly square and why the tiny shatterers and airships are flying like 20 feet offshore to make them seem far away.
---
The second point I'm really hoping for. One of the things that I feel early level maps do really well is event density. The events loop nicely, they overlap and interact. Dragonfall does this better than most other S4 maps, but a lot of the S3 and S4 maps feel like there's one event that goes through an area or, worse, that there are huge sections of the map that people NEVER go through for literally anything. I want to feel like I should really explore everything. But there's no reward in doing that on a lot of maps.
---
&gt; It's been happening for some time now
---
Some time is an unclear amount that then comes down the the readers interpretation. Some time usually implies the bug has been around longer than what would be expected to be fixed, which could be a week, a month, a year. The bug hasn't existed for a relative amount time it has existed for a exact amount of time (since friday, or tuesday whenever it was introduced), the amount of time people have been effected by the bug is relative but that doesn't matter since the amount of time the bug has been in game isn't relative.
---
I've been had and now I'm sad...which apparently turns me into sad Dr. Seuss.
---
I was so hopeful for a new expansion announcement, even if it was coming Spring 2020, just something new would be awesome.  I appreciate the storytelling of the Living World stuff but I usually binge it rather than get indulged into episodically. The new expansions draw me back in for a few months at a time.
---
My wife and I have really loved this game over the years and would love to invest more consistent time into it.
---
I seriously thought this was real because i haven't been following GW2 for several years now.  I probably would've came back to play if it really was true.
---
The devs don't directly dismiss criticism, though they only very rarely acknowledge it also.  Not being vocally dismissive is good, though not acknowledging it tends to backfire over long periods of time because it begins to look like they're ignoring the issue, which is a silent dismissal.  It's sometimes better to go ahead and say no it can't/won't happen, give a brief but reasonable reason and ride out any storm that arises.  Even if people don't like that answer and keep requesting it, e.g. dye for back items and aquabreathers, there exists a concrete answer with a (hopefully) reasonable explanation.  With that said, it's also okay for the devs to come back later and change their mind about something they said no to in the past,  e.g. Mounts.  
---
Though I didn't explicitly say it, those last two paragraphs were meant to point out that these things will happen and then pass, as they have done here.  It just takes time for the emotions to pass, and a bit of policing to keep instagators and truely out of line reactions from fanning the flames.  That isn't justifying anything, it's just a reality of dealing with people.  
---
Again, if people were not connected on the deep emotional levels where that passion exists, the game would actually be dying.  When these thing arise, and they will, everyone needs to realize that it will pass fairly quickly (There's real trouble if it doesn't).  Those who need to blow off steam will, the forum will calm down and return to reason (mostly) as has happened here yet again.
---
thanks!
---
I'd say start with PoF first mission to get the raptor mount, this makes traveling much easier and faster. Then continue from HoT and play that through, when you hit a situation where next story step is locked behind a mastery skill, go unlock Auric Basin, Tangled Depths and Dragons Stand if you can. Then /wiki event timer on the chat box and see when these maps metas are going to start. They are big popular events and net you hefty amounts of EXP needed for the masteries aswell as mats you can convert to gold and gold to gems and buy the LS3 episodes from the store.
---
Also find out how you want to gear your character so when you get gear as rewards from story missions/metas you know what stats to look for.
---
After HoT is done, continue on to PoF to get the core mounts and you should probably just finish PoF aswell before diving too deep into Living Stories.
---
Quaggans and Dolyaks, it's free real estate.
---
flair as misleading please. 
---
I was about to get back into gw2 when I saw this on the FP.
---
But you are comparing GW2 combat to all the wrong games. I think BNS, BDO and Tera are in the same field and have better combat IMHO (however other aspects of these games are not that good).
---
If you're gonna do that, whats the point of an ocean expansion? At that point you may as well just sail to Cantha and fight Selbubb there.
---
*shrug* I suppose it depends on what one focuses on and how literally one takes your "literally".
---
I find PoE's big focus on gear to on its own be a huge and fundamental difference that prevents me from subscribing to statements like that. The focus on solo play and difference in the combat system overall are also big. There's also a bit of a thematic change from a band of heroes fightning against the odds (narratively at least) to a one man demigod army who vaporizes everything on screen. Sure, PoE has a story as well but it feels...I don't know, more in the background? 
---
And also personally I always moved with the mouse in PoE and WASD in GW1 so the movement isn't the exact same for me but maybe I'm weird. 
---
But then again I also never compare GW1 to Diablo 2, my main comparison game has always been Magic: The Gathering. Which again, I suppose, reinforces that we place different amounts of emphasis on different parts of the game(s).
---
I preorderd it.
---
One thing I've learned raiding in FFXIV, and even doing midcore content with pugs is this.
---
If it ain't broken, don't fix it stupid.
---
What that means is the accepted strategies are generally accepted by most of the community, and people are extremely bad at adapting in fights.
---
For example, in FFXIV one of the recent fights requires the party to split in to two groups at multiple. Tanks and healers in one group, DPS in the other. Each DPS will be chained to a healer or a tank. The accepted strategy is for the tank/healer group to run north and the DPS to run south to break the chain. The longer the chain is on the more damage they're going to be taking for the next minute or so of the fight. This **will** cause wipes if it's done wrong. Now, for the first chain that makes total sense because everyone can run right back in.
---
However, in the add phase it's more effective for DPS to go *north*, because everyone gets knocked from the center and then split up by an AoE. This makes it impossible for a lot of DPS to hit the second add if they go south till the AoE resolves. Now obviously, the DPS going north would speed up the run about a minute or so. However, this happens roughly 6 minutes into the fight. People by this point are used to DPS south and Tanks/Healers north so that's what they're gonna do out of habit. Inevitably, multiple people mess it up and their partners attempt to adapt to fix their mistake. At the same time the person who messed up is attempting to fix their mistake also.
---
Congrats, you just wasted 6 full minutes trying to save maybe 1 minute.
---
Access to upcoming LS content, not LS2/3/4.
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
Ok so bear with me here because I've never had a chance to gush over an artwork.
---
In the engineer "Gadgets" skill unlock screen, the background has this weird "Rocketeer" looking fella, and I'd no joke instant buy a poster of that art.
---
And an elite spec would solve what? Everybody levels it up, forgets about older specs because of power creep and in 2 weeks they will already be bored of them or hit the forums complaining X spec is overpowered and bs.
---
I get everybody wants more things. But that's always the case. The consumer is never satisfied.
---
Old contents is still there. Just because it doesn't net you 100g/h doesn't mean it's pointless or forgotten. Dungeons are still fun for example.
---
And if this new season doesn't excite you, try out different games until they release something you'd enjoy. I promise it'll be super refreshing coming back after a month or two.
---
Every announcement and release cannot be catered to every player, that's just impossible. And sure, feedback is fine as long as it's constructive and not "ugh, they don't care about the game or what I want". But nonetheless crying about it for a week straight kills arguments as well because it just devolves into inane demands and accusations.
---
Just my 2 cents as a casual player who enjoys the lore or GW and doesn't enjoy grinding out prettier pixels.
---
Man, this would be cool. Would love to show off Kraitkin to ppl. :)
---
Well, some of them are tied to the lore a lot more than others. 
---
Scrapper and scourge for example.
---
I never said they were making another IP. All I said was that they would move on.
---
I can back up your claims.
---
People *always* ask if the game is alive, has active players, is worth it, etc etc. They do the same thing for FFXI, WoW, Secret World, and others. 
---
And it's weird, because the game is free so you can start the download, pop in a movie, and see how alive it is when the movie is over
---
For anyone who wants context, this is my [fan made page created as an April Fools joke](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b8m1o8/fansite_guild_wars_2_wave_of_shadow_underwater/) from earlier this year.
---
I'm glad to see people still enjoy it, and it would have been cool if Anet did something similar with this announcement, even if it is a "saga" and not an expansion.
---
Balance team was probably balancing the two vapourware projects.
---
That's what I was thinking too. Lots of people think it's scrapped elite specs, but they really are just traps-but-you-control-when-they-go-off. It'd be REALLY weird if they planned for a thief spec that "gained" preparations.
---
Iron legion would love the rammstein industrial sound imo.
---
I had no issue picking up groups in T1 fractals and can usually find dungeons. 
---
Not really into PvP or raids yet, so I can't comment on those. 
---
But I had a full group within 4 minutes of posting a fractal lfg
---
Bad Bot
---
Great fan art, but getting pretty sick of this shitpost stuff. The new living world season is going to be expansion quality, there's more than the stuff they announced coming (not sure why they said "thered be more surprises coming" instead of just announcing it). If its supposed to be expansion quality then there will be more stuff coming just more "down the line" this is what people want, they want games as a service!
---
Guild Wars 2 is worth spending the money on. It holds up great single player, multiplayer, dying or undying. You get what you pay for and especially right now where you pay a measly \~$35 for more or less 7 years of content (the living world being locked behind money).  
---
The community is just a little bit cranky right now, cause the announcement trailer of the update didn't mention what they wanted to hear (partially clear enough).
---
OMG being able to rearrange the UI exactly how you wanted it.  
---
Hnnng.
---
Any of you happens to be a billionaire playing gw2? If you are among us, please buy anet and all the franchise, get rid of incompetence people and make this amazing expansion happen. I am crying right now. It's too painful to see the game have this much potential and not being use to it's max potential.
---
i went to the shop, then clicked on buy a expansion, then added an charcater slot, then deleted the expansion
---
gw1 perma pre searing mobile remastered hd 4k switch ps4 vr pls
---
Back at launch it was really common for people to hit level 30 and immediately go to Ascalon. People wanted to do dungeons as soon as possible. I did four runs of story mode in my very first day of dungeoning because people were anxious to experience that content. 
---
I appreciated that the personal story tries to push you to the dungeons as you go along. I think had Anet doubled down on dungeons later on, or used dungeons to ease into harder Raids, we might have had a more positive experience at this point.
---
Realistically as a new player you have a lot to do.
---
For people that like to do PvP, WvW or endgame PvE the game is pretty stale and there are no dates for anything new.
---
In the particular case of raids and fractals we have **zero** clue what will happen, alliances have been worked on for months now with no set dates and PvP is about the same.
---

Remember the people with the loudest voices will be the negatives ones.
---
I m sorry about the mess. The " message" was this:
---
Your serial code(s) are listed below and have also been sent to the email address you provided. If any of your purchases are gifts, please include the following instructions along with the serial code(s).
---
it then told me to go to my arena.net account and redeem the code. 
---
I think that my problem is with the serialcode i have in my game box is undefined, although i dont know why
---
Play but do not invest much or you will end up being one of the "toxic vets". Game is good as a little side thing you play but horrendous as full time mmo.
---
That's how it works, yes, per episode. Can you give any more details as to which episodes you are missing and why you're having to buy it from the gemstore to unlock them?
---
It shouldn't matter to you what people are saying right now, as said many times this is a very small minority of players and people that do not play anymore. And you missed nothing by starting now.
---
Don't worry about feeling like you're behind everyone else just play the game and it will be easy to get right into Level 80 content when you get to that point. :) Use the Wiki, find a Guild, ask too many questions and get too much help! And search though this sub reddit for the "Hey! I'm new here!" posts. There is a loooong history...
---
Hope you enjoy the game. :)
---
I said drink some coffee because your last few responses on this sub and in this original post make you look like an angry half wit.  The majority of my post was an opinion and personal perspective. 
---
My remark about them not coming out frequently enough to keep me interested is a pretty common and widely shared complaint about gw2 raids.
---
My personal opinion about them not being worth running ONCE you've unlocked everything seems pretty justified. After years of raiding there really is no point...other games inadvertently don't have this issue due to the gear treadmill that we don't have. Yes that's a good thing because that doesn't make old raids invalid...but it opens up other issues.  Profit was hardly the focus of my post.
---
The actual elitists don't really join trainings, they usually join high'ish req pugs to practise deeps and then leave after the dps golemn bosses. Don't really like that behaviour either but it is far better than the destructive elitism the wannabe tryhards spread among the training groups.
---
Well I’m not you, and I don’t go on a losing streak
---
Well, that explains why there isn't a serial code.  The code is for unlocking expansions, not items.  Items are normally just delivered to your account.
---
You will find people for "meme" groups, you just (probably, likely) won't get the kill. And that's fine - it's supposed to be the hardest content in the game. Why should it be okay to faceroll through it in rare gear?
---
Thanks for replying! I'm online right now, before LS5 is (presumably) released, but LS4 is asking for 200 gem for an unlock.
---
It's like a window in to the timeline we should be in...
---
Finally being one of the 5 people who made kraitkin has paid off
---
How long does it take for the game code to arrive? i bought it like 1h ago and still dont have anything, checked all the folders in my outlook, there is nothing.
---
They'll communicate less and slowly release less content. They wont ever say this (duh) but the game is being put into maintenance while resources, even after the budget cuts and "refocus" continue to be funneled to other projects (and / or blatantly mismanaged).
---
I'd love to believe otherwise but they've claimed they would be doing that several times, and they've never succeeded. At this point they're not even claiming that anymore. Instead they claim they're "working on" alliances. X D
---
Weird.  Anyway, there should be a new serial code that unlocks the item, not the original serial code for the game.  If there isn't one, you definitely need to contact support.
---
Eh, I've always been someone who gets upset for no reason over specifics, so I always make sure I'm very descriptive when it comes to elite specs/professions/builds in this game.
---
In actuality, I'm probably just being a grammar nazi, though.
---
At least this means we could likely see dwarves again.
---
You say you’ve been perusing the Subreddit and yet you ask this question which has been asked numerous times all with the same answers.
---
How about you take a look at all the posts with the exact same content that have popped up lately you d1psh-t
---
ok, thanks
---
Honestly, it sounds like you kinda broke the store.  Normally, you're supposed to buy gems with money, then buy character slots with gems.  They don't really sell character slots for straight cash unless bundled with an expansion.
---
Okay. Let's do this slowly. Please mark your answers with 1, 2, et cetera, and answer only what was asked in that question
---
1. You said you bought the physical game, which means you have a serial code. Don't you already play the game **Guild Wars 2**? *Answer "Yes" or "No"*
---
2. What is the item you bought and want to redeem? *Please copy and paste the item's name directly from the store*
---
3. It says in the message that "Your serial code(s) are listed below". Do you see the item you bought (from answer #1) in that list? *Answer "Yes" or "No"*
---
4. If you do see the item, is there a serial code next to it? *Answer "Yes" or "No"*
---
Anet seems to be locking and deleting posts having to do with this subject. Surprise they left the merch threads with the posts about how people want to buy things...
---
The point being that assuming someone doesn't know something or that someone's skills are lacking is something more commonly experienced by women in the games industry. Obviously it's not *exclusive* and I have no doubt that you could find individual examples of people doubting the expertise of developers of any gender. *However*, it's still something experienced much more by women.
---
"well talk about that in the months to come"....I could hear the remnants of the WvW community cry out
---
That's the point of it. If we don't cause any kind of trouble, being by pushing players away or calling attention, not likely anet will care. It is hard enough for them to care when we do that, will be even less probable if we don't. I know some devs care but companies as a whole only listen when it affects their pockets.
---
HoT was teased 2.5 years after initial release and didn’t come out til about 9 months later. During that time they spent many blog posts, chat sessions, and several trailers detailing new specs. So it wasn’t like people went a full 3 years without looking forward to new ways to play their class. Also since the game was new it’s not like you immediately need to start releasing new specs or skills anyway since the entire class is new and most MMOs take the first few years to really iterate on those classes and systems
---
its starting to feel like anet just uses positive feedback the same way they use negative feedback: as an excuse to not feel like they have to address anything. its getting objectively worse now
---
It's in the post on the left.
---
I'll say it as a disgruntled vet: the game is what you make of it. There's loads of content int the game for you, as a new player, to spend a lot of time going through and completing. It would most likely take years to reach the point a lot of veterans are at where you would be upset with the content. So my advice: try it, go through the core game, and find a group to play with. If you enjoy it, get the expansions(might go on sale soon but who knows since its buy one get one now) and play through the content there. And at that point, if you're still enjoying it, get the previous living world seasons if you want except for season 1 since that isn't available anymore. If you're only looking to get the expansions and not the previous LS, then the 17th is when the new stuff begins. Personally, I'd try and go through everything before hand, but it's up to you.
---
You can drop them a few dps.report links of your successful raids if you actually think you're that good and worthy to join. Trying to join saying "i'm experienced" is basically the same as buying alcohol underage without showing your id, there's no reason people should trust you.
---
Think PoF had something about that as well?
---
ok ty
---
19 months
---
half the wvw discords I'm in disbanded after the announcement. feelsbadman
---
&gt; The first point is highly unlikely. I believe the devs said Dragonfall  is literally the largest/most detailed map they can put in the game.  That's why it's an ugly square and why the tiny shatterers and airships  are flying like 20 feet offshore to make them seem far away. 
---
if thats really true, then it would seem that the game literally does have the technical capabilities needed to see its own potential fulfilled. that is actually shockingly disappointing if its really true. do you have a source?
---
Anet's map game has been solid since gw1.
---
No, the problem is, that most people dont have a clue how to command raiding, neither in experienced squads nor training lfgs. 
---
You have to have read up on strats (plural!), team comps (also plural!), know how and where to place markers, give concise commands and kick toxic or too inept players.
---
Nothing to do with "250 LI" or not.
---
Redditers said that, Anet never said "we shelved all side projects", you can be pretty sure this is why we have this Saga and no expac, 250 devs, maybe 180 are on gw2 and 70 on other things
---
Now you mention it. In fact, I wonder, why do we need Funko merch and Funko minis in the game anyway? Imagine if you really used the last minutes of the event to talk about elite specs, Jormag, the story in general. etc.
---
The problem was legendary journey they planned. Like growing and caring for the crow with never more or feeding the ooze for juggernaut. They failed to deliver that on time since it took too much planning and modyfying content
---
Just to give context, I was around when WoW introduced Achievements to the game, and one of them was a cumulative achievement for the amount of times your character 'jumped'.  I think I maxed that one out rather quickly, mainly waiting on pulls and such during raids.  I'm ADHD IRL and in-game, so I ...jump.   When I left WoW and tried GW1, yeah, it was an issue :)
---
I always had the impression PoF maps were bigger. Maybe it's how they designed the areas.
---
DX12 is low level api with good multithreading support. This makes it a good thing to implement strict DX9 implementation that is faster than default DX9.
---
I'm getting to that point honestly. They are administrating this Reddit sub and forums like NAZIS. Yeah, I said it. I'm Jewish guys so don't be too offended now... 
---
Posts go missing in the night. Moderate voices going dark in place of a "toxic" community that is "ungrateful" and never says thank you. All that is left is propaganda to fit Anet as the protectors of their devs when it was them the mud was flying at. Not a good move Anet. Stopping toxicity is one thing but blatantly silencing people just for their disappointment in proper communication from someone that claims we are a "community" (commun) is pretty for sure. Trying to say that all are toxic when it was a few morons. La sigh, little hope for GW2 after seeing my shit taken down and/or locked when it voices a real concern without toxicity. They can never play the friendly neighborhood gaming company with me again (Seattle/Portland based). Respect for Anet is slipping fast.
---
 BTW I used Nazis cause this kinda of gestapo mentality about hiding opposition is really concerning. Straight out of a Nazi play book. Anet staff reading this... you as a company (not individuals) are literally using Nazi tactics on your own player base that you claim is your "community". Really for sure guys...
---
Where are you getting the 180/70 numbers?  
---
And I thought ANET did say after the layoffs that all side projects were dropped.
---
It's your problem that you cant raid, not community's. Make your own group and people will join, if you're decent enough you'll kill the easy bosses otherwise stick with t1 fractals, idk what to tell you.
---
Plus we all know what that one post will say. It'll go something along the lines of this.
---
*"Hello there, we know we haven't communicated much lately, but we want to be completely transparent from now on. We're doing X, Y and Z and we'll be listening very closely to your feedback. I ask you all to be patient and we apologize for X and will do everything in our power to prevent it from happening again."*
---
Then they'll post the big post of changes, most of each will be big changes for things no one asked for and tiny touches for what people did ask changes for, probably some talk about the next bit of content, likely a post for more skins being thrown into the lootboxes and they'll end it with "i'll see you all in Tyria champions" or something similar. Many will defend them as if their own families worked there and would be abused if they didn't and many will feel the apology is horrible along with the fact they're doing the same mistakes immediately. Reddit will light up, forums won't change since the mods are extremely trigger happy and nothing will change.
---
Does he? I haven't played GW2 in years, since pre-expansions. Where are they?
---
:/ see?

Me and my team actually did this for one of Snow Crows meme comp challenges.

Because commanding a raidsquad correctly is more than just putting up a LFG. It takes quite a lot of knowledge (not experience!) to make a raidsquad work.
---
And there are no guides on it directly. You have to piece that knowledge together for yourself.
---
Its easier to just slap on high LI/KP requirements on your LFG and hope that people that join will organize themselves. Hence why most high LI/KP LFGs are painfully bad.
---
ANet is losing out on so much money by not selling all this.
---
must be from sitting in crystal oasis.
---
Wait for a while and send a message to support if you dont receive anything.
---
so where you gona COVERAGE ALONE FOR WHOLE GROUP? :DDDDD can you be my sponsor pls? thx.
---
I'm doing the same thing that many other players claim to be doing: I have shifted my GW2 gaming into 'maintenance' mode.  No real money purchases. No long term plans or investments. I could be working on a new legendary, but aren't.  I could be working to hit some milestones in WvW, but aren't.  I log in, do 1-2 matches in sPvP for quick dailies, grab some time in WvW for more dailies, and if I have time, maybe grab some Fractals for gold and relics.  Not worrying about progressing toward Fractal God.  Not caring about finishing Diamond Chest each week.  I'm still enjoying my day-to-day game play, but I no longer look at any of my in-game activity as 'investing' in future game play, as I just don't know when this game will pull the plug, or when I will hit a point where it no longer holds any interest for me.
---
Living story to me is utterly useless, doesn't being any content I actually play. I'd happily pay for useful content if I had the option.
---
I like gw2 for its combat and wvw, but mostly would prefer wotlk era wow content model over what we have.
---
you all acting like its dead, never to be played again, but you can still play it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Re: Logan's portrait. Earlier in that part of the LS episode, iirc, you can interrupt a Mesmer having some private fun with a Logan illusion. I think the portrait was just another joke about him being an attractive man.
---
I don't know if I would call it the flavor of the month. Other MMOs have been pretty successful in old versions of their game. Everquest Progression Servers for example pretty much carry that IP as far as I can tell.
---
You do know that GW2 revenue-wise is a ***veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery*** far way away from being anywhere close to a point where they would ever shut down the servers, right? I get the feeling people simply dont know what maintenance mode or shut down servers *mean*.
---
can I haz ur stuff
---
I don't think The Table is still a thing.
---
Yep, alredy did that, thanks.
---
Bound by Blood.  Blood legion, and family.  In Rytlock's requiem story it is shown that he has a very bad relationship with his superior, who made him a Tribune as a way of giving him a gift that meant something, one he could not refuse, but also one that could be taken away and thus used as a tool to manipulate him.  If Rytlock also has some uncommon link with his cubs, his already rather vile boss will almost certainly at some point try to use that as a tool to get at Rytlock... Possibly even feeding Rytlock's cubs to the Flame or dragons while making sure Rytlock himself could not be there to protect his own.  
---
Why would the Blood Legion Imperetor possibly want to link up with Flame given the history of those two legions especially?  The simplest answer is that Flame hates humans as much as he does.  I also think that's pretty shallow if it ends up being the only thing going on... That said, there are plenty of other things that could be going on.  
---
Jormag seems to be shown as preferring to work like a political puppeteer dictator.  Promising power, awarding the most zealous acolytes with more power and using their example to tempt more people into joining the ranks.  Jormag also doesn't care if these acolytes go at each others throats, as the Sons of Svanir do when killing any Norn women who become icebrood as they find them, which makes them busy policing each other instead of potentially questioning the leader.  
---
Before going too far off topic, it's possible that Bangar's rage may have put him in a position to be open to Jormag's communication medium.  Recall the odd whispers surrounding the mysterious guys that appeared around the shiverpeaks recently, and it doesn't have to be Bangar directly but someone near him.  Flame could be involved here in a number of ways, including chosing Jormag instead of the next fire-god and sending someone who was touched by Jormag into the presence of Bangar.  The words spoken by Jormag (presumably) during the cinematic were also telling... They were offering a kind of hope in the face of a threat.  Manipulation.  All Jormag needs is a way in, and given enough time and attempts, a way in will be found.  Holding something like hatred or long standing and very public and/or well known disagreements and bad feelings are a very easy in.  
---
Regarding the status of females, if his hatred of humans and the treaties is taking hold, it literally doesn't matter to him.  He will not hesitate to throw them back under the bus if it gets him what he wants but he also likely would not feel strongly if they kept their warrior status.  If anything, Flame has more to gain by letting Blood females keep their place and saying nothing.  
---
Uniting the Charr under a new Khan-Ur means it's time for war.  Against who doesn't matter much really.  The humans won't like this, the Asura and Sylvari will most likely side with the humans in this, and the Norn won't care unless the Charr armies decide to try and march through them again.  
---
However, there is a possibility he could be marshalling the Charr to fight Jormag or Primordus.  There's no way this will not be a power grab on his part, and the possibility of a false flag is high, but it's not an unreasonable way to make the attempt without starting a war outright.  
---
What would Flame have to gain by showing up to this?  They are outcasts right now and on a pretty brutal losing streak.  One way to bring an enemy to the table is to crush their ability to sustain themselves, force them into a position where they have to negotiate just to survive.  Flame could agree to this to end the hostilities, if only to relieve the pressure while they figure out what to do next.  
---
As stated they could agree to this as a means to try and kill everybody because FU all, right?  
---
OR they could have already negotiated with Bangar and the plan is to kill the leadership of the other two legions...again with the power grab by Bangar, but it also gives Flame a shot at a rather big victory.  
---
Where does Jormag play in on this?  He's on the Blood Legion Homeland's doorstep as well as the Norn, though we haven't seen Icebrood appear outside of an area where they are kept cold by something, it's not unreasonable to think their corrupted ice may have some ability to chill surrounding areas, resulting in an unnatural, creeping, frozen doom coming down from the mountains into the Charr's homeland.  Going slow would also be intentional, creating anxiety and fear that could be played with, provoking a military response that will expose more to the manipulation and corruption who can then go further out without raising alarm to do their thing.  This is a possible expression of that Lovecraftian doom that was mentioned during the announcement and could truely be powerful if the devs go all in and don't leave any outs to break the feeling.
---
Yee, also all the people jumping onto them saying people with legitimate concerns are "cranky" or "just complaining"
---
I don't know, but it feels like some people like their echo chamber too much on this sub so they try to force it back.
---
&gt; Average full clear time on eu in the past year went from about 3 hours with any group on monday to over 6.
---
So your argument is that you had a bad group last monday? That's pretty thin. *I* had no issues with fullclears since these people left. It never took 6 hours for a full clear, not even close to that.
---
I think *you* should speak for yourself, too. ;)
---
Twitter video quality isn't the best but I'm pretty excited to see Grothmar Valley tbh.
---
I mean, i assume we'll get at least 2.  1 per elite spec would be nice, so 4, yeah.  And I think 5 dollars each is good.  I don't expect them to be as popular as bag slots, tho.  Like....well, to be honest, I just make a new character if I want to change builds.  So I'm already paying 10 dollars...but a new character provides a bit more utility than a build template slot.  As for having them be portable.....I dunno, it seems like a lot of work to save 400 gems.
---
&gt;	If there was only 1 mode available, and it was considered the one and only “normal”, then ofcourse more people would play it.
---
You mean like how there's only one raid mode and all the casuals play it now, right?
---
isint the same as private servers. people make or take art assets from games and then place them in the unreal 4 engine. someone did world of warcraft dalaran 2.0 in unreal 4
---
Oh i'm sorry, i thought this was trailer for a completely different game and not the next GW2 story.
---
They got burning man, Elite Tauren Chieftains ripoffs and a lot of minigames.
---
i dont see how the communication has changed since the layoffs. we got silence, a statement that the game isnt cancelled after the layoffs, then complete silence until episode 6, complete silence again, this announcement, and now i dont think there is any reason to expect anything else. at this point, i am not too interested in whatever game they have planned next if they intend to treat it the same way they have been treating their current main game, for years now. i mean say what you will, but if they cant even manage to properly manage the development of the things that were taking all the attention away from gw2, then i dont see them saving their own company as anything but an uphill battle, the hill of which is at a 90 degree angle, all because of how they have managed the work and time of the devs. again, its not the devs fault. its management and advertising. i keep repeating it. management and advertising. but more importantly, management needs to step up right now. advertising only gets shit on when it does something completely stupid and cringy that doesnt actually help sell the game, which can describe a large number of the things they have done for advertising until like, only this year.
---
This should settle the unrest! All is good now everyone!
---
Let's just revert it to HoT please. Gimme that music.
---
Hmm ok. You've got a point. Probably best to pack it up and move on before it all gets really depressing. If Anet won't listen to feedback then it's probably best to just give up on it all.
---
and here I thought I'd be saving time 😂😂 guess I'm not so slick after all. thank you!
---
Oooh look. 
---
A mini game map :(
---
Anybody have a mirror?
---
I started playing FFXIV, lol
---
This I can stand behind.  Fully unlock the spec and be allowed to use the weapon whenever you please.
---
Personally I don't want to see anymore elite specs, ever.  From a competitive standpoint, Anet has completely failed to balance POF specs even after 2 years, and that has driven many players from the game.  Balance updates are too infrequent and usually create more problems than they solve.  I'll take less powercreep over more powerceep any day.
---
i would love that
---
The thief pirate spec too, jesus christ
---
Lmao, error 404 Anet action not found. Not that this is new or surprising amirite?
---
My issue is, gw2 endgame is aesthetics. Other games have gear score, we have fashion wars. And yet I dont get any amazing skins dropping from the raids i do with my team. They're just OK. And besides w5 (dhuum), it's always weapon skins. And then eventually you can just buy them with raid currency anyway. Raids are not rewarding. If anet would add unique skin drops to raids that you can't just buy with currency after a while, I would feel there would be more incentive to continue raiding/playing the game.
---
I really hope this map isn't just filled with festival level mini-game gimmicks.
---
This supports my worst fear about blood legion - they are reusing regular iron legion assets, so blood legion will have no individual character.
---
Low-cost Wars 2, here we go... yay...
---
I want a huge-ass charr plushie, I can't believe the one in the game isn't an actual thing.
---
Well as far as prologue maps go this is not what I expected. I wonder if it will be in permanent festival mode after chapter 1 comes out.
---
Hmmm, I have 16GB of RAM and 6GB of VRAM and I seem to get a very long loading time of objects. Even at stock.

The phrase, 'That is no upgrade from what we already have,' is clearly referring to arcdps build templates.  It all ANet's templates do is match what a fan made 24 months ago, that will be very disappointing

Yes, please get that phospholuminescence out of my sight! ;)

Gw2 already has enough abandoned mini games.

Now you are looking for excuses. If we look at the Bangar x Rytlock cutscene, it looks like copy pasted Black Citadel interior. This is not effective usage of old assets, this is straight up copy pasting.

I expected Blood Legion to have their own flavour, not to be red coloured Iron leftovers.
---
BLC items have been around since inception, yes, but BLC ONLY random chance items are a relatively new thing in the game’s life cycle. And they’ve been adding more and more of those over the past few years.
---
unfortunately that looks like what its gonna be :(
---
The mini games may still prove to be fun though.
---
i finished the grind with relative ease, as a mainly WvW player, the reward tracks give 50 map currency per completion (with exception to istan which gives 250, although with meteors you wouldn’t need so do this). 
---
Paired with this I parked my alts at specific hearts that could be completed easily while i was working on that specific map. Here is what I did for each map:
---
Sand swept Isles: Daily Specimen chamber and node gathering. This was a little slow but steady since people farm the chamber pre event, the specimen event usually has people.
---
Domain of Kourna: Starting from the main waypoint, I would travel south west to the corsair heart gathering all caches along the way. The heart is simple to complete by collecting 20 messages in a bottle, there are 12 floating along the coast and in the water, but they respawn on relog, so you can easily gather the 20 needed. Then I would head east to the bridge for the 2 kourna chests and cache is. Each alt have about 10 currency which added up quickly.
---
Jahai: did the heart near the pact waypoint in the south, near the sun refuge entrance. You just pick up one of the shards on the ground and throw it st the target dummies. You can position the projectile to hit 3 dummies at once to speed things up.
---
THK: parked alts at the top left heart, mounted up and interacting with the crowds to do the heart, it takes less than a minute for each alt.
---
Istan was meteors, Dragonfall was meta farm. Sprinkled with these heart farms, I just did the assorted metas when I felt like it. Lastly don’t forget to buy 5 currency per day in Dragonfall.
---
/&gt;ANet

---
Pick one.
---
And yet nothing changes. People have been saying these things for years...
---
Yes, imagine if they could pump out a new, good expansion six months after having their studio fucked over by layoffs and NCSoft's bullshit. Why can't they do that!?
---
This looks super good and is awesomely made, and it would be awesome if they made it, and call me a paid shill if you want to, but no studio with Anet's current resources can push out all the stuff people seem to be demanding of them.
---
Wasn't this already posted a few times?
---
This is why I was _real_ excited for the announcement. The break between HoT and PoF was similar to the break between PoF and LS5, so new elite specs made perfect sense.
---
I used armors as an example of poor choice if they are going to be the only difference between Ascalon and Blood Homelands architecture and environment.
---
Thank you for the great info!
---
Should've been called "Guild Wars 2: Bubbles".
---
&gt; Interesting..... so maybe, it wasnt us filthy "elitists" after all....
---
Most people with 250LI+ call themself "elitists" or at least act like one, you know? ;)
---
Nobody said that only the real hardcore players can act like ~~assholes~~ elitists. 250LI seems to be the magic border to toxicity.
---
!remindme 2 years
---
especially considering how long ago that it was that alliances were first announced
---
I don't wvw, and I was keen on alliances because it had me interested to jump back in for the first time since the changes to the maps when they removed the big lakes.
---
Most anniversary sales have lasted a few days, at least. And there's usually a countdown when they get ready to remove it.
---
they said during the presentation that the prologue map wont change in any way, only the episodic maps labeled "1" and so on. someone said that they heard the map will change little by little and expand west as it comes closer to episode 2, which would be awesome in my eyes, but i didnt see that officially stated anywhere and doubt its going to happen. at this point, it will be nice to log in every once in a while to bask in the miracle that this game isnt completely abandoned by its own management yet. notice how i never say devs. the devs always have more passion and more desire to bring this game to its full potential. and if management is going to do this to their main money maker, then i dont know how they are going to avoid making the same mistakes with their next one. come the third incarnation of the guild wars universe, i will make sure to go into with the expectation that what i see is already in its final state and will never change or be fixed, just more of the same giant trail of additions that have no bearing on the previous additions (gliding and mounts, EXPANSION level features, are the exception, and the level of ingenuity we were led to believe they would be bringing to this season when they said expansion level content. we have yet to see any single thing that meets that level)
---
ppl complain everything.
---
Play a better game
---
You joke but I think gw1 would make a fantastic mobile game. Movement and limited skillbar already fits well with touch input and modern mobile devices are perfectly capable to run those visuals. 
---
The UI would need an overhaul and the game would need rebalancing but it would work.
---
Fuckin hell. They can add more tier for the expansion, up to $150 and I would buy it in a heart beat. 
---
Too bad, ant isn't even considering it. Shame.
---
It was nice supporting teapot with ERP, but now that he left, why bother?
---
And what happens if won't have "lot of vendors with a lot of items", c' mon you really think they will add 20+ new items for this map.
---
So you are in fact denying the differences in terrain and architecture shown both here and in the original announcement, as well as using armors as an example despite also saying you weren't talking about armors.
---
Like, sorry man, but this is not even being remotely fair to the design team, and they are the department actually trying here.
---
holy shit. idk if gw2 has a heal meter, but i'd love to see what a heal meter on this run looks. In WoW in the Icecrown Raid they introduced a raid boss that needed to be healed, and it was really a fight for the healers to shine, and I thought that was really cool. It would be awesome to see healers take center stage on some fights like your healers did on this run.
---
Thanks for sharing your point of view.
---
I feel personally attacked hahaha
---
He didn't leave, he's just playing something else between content releases.
---
&gt;People laid off were laid off from other cancelled projects and those that were left were moved to gw2.
---
I don't know what rock you've been under, but it was made very clear that people from other projects AND from GW2 were laid off, *not* just from other projects. You can argue with me all you want, but it takes time to bring people up to speed and handle team changes. They have an entire forum post on it.
---
&gt;Then they shouldn't have released the blog post 6 months ago and kept us in silence if they weren't planning to follow up on it. Again, lack of communication is their fault.
---
What blog post 6 months ago? April? That was 4 months ago and they specifically stated in the blog post that everything was "subject to change" and nothing was final.
---
&gt;No, just because its the universal standard in the industry. That's like claiming an FoV slider is an expansion worthy feature. No its a universal standard, just because some games ship without one that doesn't make it an "expansion worthy feature."
---
Name me one major MMO, besides GW1, that launched with a build templating system that saved character builds. WoW didn't, FF14 didn't, EVE didn't, Path of Exile didn't (I don't think it has one now even). All of those games (except maybe FF14) had external tools/mods that handled that until the devs implemented the feature years later. That's not an "industry standard".
---
Again, there are tons of news articles, videos, forum posts, reddit posts on how the GW2 dev team was also hit by the layoffs. Quit turning a blind eye to information you seem to deem irrelevant.
---
&gt;A.) They should have communicated.  
---
&gt;B.) They shouldn't have pretended this is a grand new feature
---
A.) They did. It's in a forum post. We are not board members, project managers, etc. We are not entitled to daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly updates.
---
B.) They didn't. The closest thing you can use to make that argument is the 48 hour countdown, I'll give you that, but their messaging was very clear. The *community* (myself included) inferred that based on what *WE* wanted to hear.
---
&gt;No, they did not give us an update. They announced, that they will be announcing an announcement in a few months where they will be announcing an "update".
---
I work in the tech industry, sometimes that is *all the information there is to give*. You want them to make something up for you?
---
&gt;Except we didn't get "more" than just elite specs.  
---
&gt;We got less.  
---
&gt;Far less.  
---
&gt;We got a feature that should have been included before release and 10 man bounties.
---
If they are moving forward with LW as the future of all content and features, what we in the tech community call a more "DevOps" focus, then you won't have large lists of features anymore. They will be fewer, but come at a faster pace (relative to the two year expansion cycle). That's been their goal since the beginning AND there is tons of data on how that is *better for the company AND the customers*. We have at least 3 yearly studies on this in the tech world run by 3 different organizations and they all come back with the same results every year.
---
&gt;They had a blog post 6 months ago talking about season 5 including expansion worthy features and kept us in the silence since.
---
You mean the blog post on the future of Guild Wars 2's development philosophy? They did list quite a few features being worked on in there. Two have shipped since then and another is nearing completion. Are you seriously telling me that you only want features to ship with the content updates or expansions. You'd really rather wait that long and get an influx of features at once just to create the illusion that they somehow did more work than they would have by releasing iteratively when things are ready?
---
&gt;What is the status on the new elite specs? What is the status on fractals? What is the status in WvW? What is the status in PvP? What is the status on raids? Are there new mechanics like gliding and mounts on the way? If we care about any of these when should we expect an update? Do leave the game because they are abandoned? Do we stay because they're getting an update?  
---
&gt;Anet hasn't communicated jack shit with us.
---
1. New elite specs were never promised. We aren't the project managers, we don't dictate direction like that.
---
2. Fractals and Raids haven't changed as of now. They are still releasing slow and steady as part of the major content updates. I hope it improves, but no news just means that they have, well, no news. They can't give us what they don't have.
---
3. WvW - they gave us the update. That they have nothing new to share at this time. That is an update. Sometimes that's how we update customers. The community doesn't get to come in and dictate that internal (and standard) business practices change because you want news "now".
---
4. PvP - They still are doing balance, more frequently than PvE updates too. They still have automated tournaments. And they gave an update about the Swiss Tournaments (yes, they were delayed due to layoffs, but that's no news to anyone who understands layoffs or read the forum post back in March).
---
5. New Mechanics - they just talked about a new set of masteries for crying out loud AND mentioned that they would be taking advantage of existing ones in new maps. What more do you want. There's not a lot of other places to go with movement mechanics now that gliding and mounts are in. 
---
&gt;After 6 months in silence with a dreary contet drought, no, its not just a minority that isn't happy.
---
Strange because reddit and the forums are literally the only places I'm seeing complaints. In game I see few. Most of my guild mates in my guilds aren't upset at all and think the vocal ones are overreacting. Some people are outright leaving the subreddit as they feel it's too toxic.
---
&gt;I know you're a paid shill because nobody is actually that stupid, but I kept replying to you because others might read what you say and take it seriously.
---
That is incredibly offensive to dismiss my views as a "paid shill" and call me stupid because I don't agree with you. Much of what I have to say comes from my experiences. Not that it will change your mind, but here's my linked in profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhollinger/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhollinger/)
---
I have the experience to back up my claims about the "industry" and business practices. I don't *really* know ArenaNet's plans, I *am* making assumptions based on my experience, their history regarding the living world as a direction they want to take, so I could definitely be wrong. But to claim that I'm a paid shill because you don't like my comments....... whatever.
---
I can’t get past teapots crack pot theories. Remember when he spent 15 minutes trying to explain why LS5 was actually an Xpac last year... even when they said it wasn’t.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cyz12q/mighty_teapot_reacting_to_the_guild_wars_2_august/
---
It already was posted 13 hours (and got deleted). Why posting it again?
---
Ohhhhhhhh. Really? That's kinda lame.
---
"these new specializations also allow you to bring your underwater prowess to land." would imply that it would bring underwater weapons to land, opening up 3 new weapon types for classes.
---
How about noticing a pattern of a complete lack of communication? 
---
You know, if anet actually announced something, stayed in touch with the community, wasn't silent for 6 months, ect, nobody would have had a feeling it would get even worse.
---
"Nobody can see into the future" no, but people with more than 2 brain cells to rub toogether can notice patterns from the past to make deduction about the future.
---
Judging from everything we've seen so far, what is the safest deduction that can be made?
---
Nah, an underwater expansion would be an even bigger disappointment. In terms of locations, there are only two that players want right now. Cantha and Jormag's Den–we're getting Jormag's Den.
---
Cancellation of unannounced projects does not mean all were cancelled. Just that some existed and more than one were cancelled. 
---
They would have during that restructuring phase been moving to make more projects. Otherwise they risk dying as a studio. 
---
GW2 is bringing in money still, but it wouldn't take much of a dip to start a cascade that left us with even more layoffs (this said, I guarantee we will get another wave of layoffs regardless when they feel like things have stablized a bit)
---
&gt;  having this dps and giving quickness (80% time up ), protection (100%), 24 vulnerability on ennemies, 700/s healing, 8 might ( not important one ) make hammerbrand very good. 
---
Which you literally don't need since you have another heal FB.
---
Also yeah, like the others said,  just post a log and it's so much easier to evaluate.
---
Maybe I would've if you weren't such a wailing wanker. ;p
---
Well you must be offended otherwise you wouldn’t care
---
The longer they wait, the worse it gets.
---
can they make bow usable in general for DH, thanks.
---
He didn't quit.  He's playing GW2 as intended: logging in once every 4 months to do the 3 hours of Living Story "content."
---
i also enjoyed watching this fight.
---
The longer the wait the more dmg the flopped over hyped announcement stream will do, thousand of players saw this announcement stream as their last straw of gw2 having a any significant future.
---
They are leaving now, as it seems like that we will get just more of the same we did the last 2-3 years, but now with even less content (dungeons/sPvP/fractals/WvW/raids/coordinated Open world fights etc.) and instant pretty much only low effort open world and story...
---
They had 30-35k viewers for this announcement and delivered a disaster, instant of making use of this opportunity, the 10-15 min of (mediocre at best) merchandise advertisement was just the big middle finger towards us customers to end the stream...
---
The best you can do now is damage control not put your heads in the sand and hide, news outlets are already picking up on this and putting gw2 in a bad light. Something like this should have been fixed on the same day. Considering that the company they work for got a major hit like this, postponing it for 5 days already instant of addressing the issue at the weekend, is mind boggling at best.
---
People are basing feelings on previous arenanet behavior and fears. Trying to temper expectations and figure out what they want to do with the game they have invested time and money into.
---
Your guildie needs to update it then. It’s working fine with the current patch.
---
Number 2. Please keep preaching this. It feels like the dps monkeys are getting more and more proud of their ignorance for what raiding actually is. The more a dps screw up mechanics the more i think theyre just garbage who can only press buttons.
---
The table is the true meta
---
And we thing Elder Dragons are the end-game bosses. THE JADED GOLEMS ARE EVERYTHING!
---
I'm surprised they didn't. At least bundle LS 2 and 3 with the package, since those are older seasons.
---
Look at all these people that know 0 about running a company acting like they know how to run a company. This community is worse than The Division 2 subreddit. Which is a cesspool.
---
You answered to my comment, of course I answered back, no?
---
Also I just asked a simple question. No sign of "being offended". 
---
Also you didn't answer my question btw.
---
that would cost probably even less, I think more like 20% of that.
---
Something something ded gaem something something...../s
---
No they are not relatively new. I dont know if they were around from the start (mainly because *I* wasnt around from the start), but they existed 4 years ago already. Thats more than half the games lifespan ago.
---
Anet kind of goes all out on the gemstore it seems. Skritt bonds are an absolute steal for gemstore costumers and completionists, and those Packs have enormous entry value.
---
Impressive.
---
Damn it. You got here first xD
---
You said “seriously, are you stupid?” That sure sounds like what an offended person would say
---
And to answer your question...no
---
No, i didn't mean challenging group content.
---
I am talking about offerings of content that keeps you busy for a longer period of time while being fun. Don't tell me you need 4-5 month for the latest living story. And iam not talking about getting 100% done, grinding all the pointless weapon skins you aren't ever gonna use.
---
Be wary of the hugbox lad, I'm rather new myself and feel burnout 6 months in. The loads of content that people are talking about has to do with open world farming and achievements. if you don't care about those, the pool of stuff to do is much smaller. Just my 2cents.
---
aka the botting login account that can't be banned for either botting or multiaccounting yet receives all the rewards. lame, immoral yet legal.
---
No, as someone who has played this game since it exists for over 6000 hours, you are far from too late. It may only be a bit overwhelming when it comes to amount of things to do.
---
I'm far from bored or out of things to do. There is so much left I didn't do. I wish there was less to do actually so I could manage to enjoy it all in decent amount of time.
---
I don't even understand most of people who complain, they make it seem like game is less then it was, while it's a lot more then it was for bigger part of it's existence. 
---
Anyway, welcome to the game and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have in past 7 years.
---
I mean they already had these mounts released last week, just in the special pack. They also probably had this pre-written. No need to make drama where it is not needed. It is only 9am in their time zone, so there is still plenty of time if they do intend on releasing a statement today.
---
It isn't even 10am where they are, the twitter post was likely scheduled a week ago.
---
Because every military building is so different to the rest.
---
Just because it's made of Iron and has a similar glass window doesn't mean it'll be the same.   
---
Did you expect Blood to make their base out of wood like norn or out of stone like humans?  
---
No, iron isn't just an iron legion thing. Iron, oil, coal, steam. That's how charr make their machines or war. 
---
Look at the [Blood legion ghostbore cannon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/c/c5/Ghostbore_Cannon.jpg) vs the [Ash legion's portable turrets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/c/c8/Ghostbore_Turret.jpg).  
---
They both made out of metal, and use the ghostbore fire to defeat ghosts, but they are used in very different ways.   
---
Blood legion go big, with large tanks rolling on treads, while iron prefers large iron caravans to load people and supplies, and ash prefer setting up tents and being constantly on the move.   
---
We've already seen their 3 styles, sometimes separate, sometimes, mingled, but they are clearly distinct.  
---
[If you look at the cinematic, you see the room is very different](https://youtu.be/Bigr3kG_Sb8) to the iron legion war room.   
---
While the iron war room is smaller and has its space occupied with a table and seats, the blood war room is a large space with just a chair, a desk, pelts on the floor.  
---
And that's just one room seen in one cinematic. We've hardly seen any more of the Blood Citadel.
---
It wouldn't take much for the game to lose a huge amount of profits. Thankfully it is low maintenance server wise and more and more elements have been automated over the years.
---
Server shutdown isn't likely to occur while Anet exists, if NCsoft decides that Anet isn't worth funding anymore though... Then that would result in a server shutdown.
---
I wager Anet has 3-5 years to get out a new product, if they can do that GW2 will likely remain operational like GW1 is but likely with a little more support as the monetization model will work better for them and justify having a few stationed devs. 
---
If they don't, there will be more layoffs and the population will dwindle without varied content. Even finding developers to stick around will be harder. 
---
Every time I see a person saying "good, anet is gw2 focused again" I shake my head.
---
its literally 9 am lol chill
---
Season pack sale at last! I missed so much in the time I was gone, this is great.
---
I specifically said BLC RNG items (I think it started with a weapon skin or the bitterfrost frontier vista pass). A company with several hundreds of employees is not putting out content representative of that number. More than likely, a portion of Anet staff are still working on projects unrelated to the game, the same reason the laid offs happened in the first place.
---
Yeah? it is a means of coping and venting at Anet, letting them know the status of an element of the community and why they might be quitting or slowing in play.
---
Because if people don't speak the metrics don't show the why.
---
I didn't know it before and I got fooled XD. I wish anet would actually care for its community and listen to them. :(
---
Most fun i had was running 55monk in AB, and teammates seeing you lifebar spaz out like a Winamp equalizer. Theyre like wtf? Heal me! And opponents in chat spamming "GO BACK TO FARMING NOOB"
---
Um... Unless I missed something we don't actually know that that scene does not take place at the Black Citadel. The Blood Citadel isn't supposed to be anywhere near the map we are going to, and Rytlock has been AWOL from his post since PoF started. Technically even sooner since he had to be dragged back in Season 3. So yeah, Bangar could have ordered him to return to his post as is his duty.
---
No one knows other than ANet.  Anyone claiming otherwise or throwing out random numbers is just guessing.  Like you said, we have to take them at their word until information validates they are working on other projects.
---
Argument from ignorance... “I don’t know BUT...”
---
The longer the wait the more dmg the flopped over hyped announcement stream will do, thousand of players saw this announcement stream as their last straw of gw2 having any significant future for them.
---
They are leaving now and wont come back, as it seems like that we will get just more of the same we did the last 2-3 years, but now with even less content (dungeons/sPvP/fractals/WvW/raids/coordinated Open world fights etc.) and instant pretty much only low effort non challenging open world which you do only solo and 2-3h worth of story every 3 months...
---
They had 30-35k viewers for this announcement and delivered sort of a disaster, instant of making use of this opportunity, the 10-15 min of (mediocre at best) merchandise advertisement of 45 min total run time was just the big middle finger towards us customers to close out the stream...
---
The best you can do now is damage control, not put your heads in the sand and hide, news outlets are already picking up on this and putting gw2 in a bad light.
---
Something like this should have been fixed on the same day. Considering that the company they work for got a major hit like this, postponing it for 5 days already instant of addressing the issue at the weekend, is mind boggling at best.
---
no one in the audience looked like they were having fun.
---
GW1 is the best game I have ever played. I would pay $500 for a Guild Wars Classic like they did for wow classic. 
---
If Anet doesn't come back to this playstyle, I hope another studio eventually will.
---
Wow, I clicked the link, thought they made some nice horizon mount skin collection hunt, until I noticed that its all gemshop stuff.. Almost had my hopes up there.
---
I know, I'm just not sure if the sword could be unhooked from the dual attacks.
---
The stealth skill for the deadeye rifle increases its damage based on malice, as it used to be skill four when deadeyes would kneel. The idea is that you raise up your malice by using skills and then, whether by trait or active skill, stealth so you can have your big snipe. Without malice the stealth skill hits like a limp noodle.
---
Truthfully, I'm sure that all the weapons can be unhooked from their elite specs, I'm just not sure whether or not the coding would allow it at this time.
---
For what little a minority opinion is worth.....
---
I don't think you can call GW2's endgame 'open ended' any more. There was a time a couple years ago when it was maybe the greatest Theme Park MMO on the market, something for everyone but not anymore. It used to be a very 'play the way you want' game with multiple avenues to acquire 'stuff' and multiple modes to spend your time. The game was very well balanced for different levels of play from pure casual to challenging hardcore content. 
---
Now GW2 is a story game. You HAVE to do the story to progress, to get new endgame 'stuff' like grinding new mounts. All new content is focused around the LW either directly or to force you play the story. 'Living World' is kind of a ironic as player actions haven't changed their story or the world since the Personal Story. Nothing new is offered for sPvP or WvW; Raids and Fractals new content is very few and far between and have become less and less exciting. I'd argue that Open World isn't receiving any meaningful new content. Small limited LW maps are not expansion maps and are there to serve the story not the greater world.  
---
I know most of the people on here think the story is great, fantastic for you. Seriously, I'm very glad. While I still log in and play a couple hours here and there my 'story time' gaming is now Witch 3, Reddead Redemption,... and currently NieR: Automata. My PvP is currently League of Legends because while GW2's sPvP is great mechanically and game'wise the lack of luv and population makes is non-competitive.
---
The youtube chat was filled with F at the end of the announcement. It's really bad.
---
On r/drugs people dont use paragraphs because they're high as a kite.
---
On this sub people dont use paragraphs because ... reasons? 
---
Another rant about high li raids. People demand high li in raids to avoid annoying and overly demanding gw2 trashuals. Because these players outnumber people capable of doing the content 1:100, high requirements are necessary to be able to enjoy the game for many groups. 
---
It's a direct result of most gw2 players being leeches who aim for minimum effort maximum rewards in a genuinely quite easy game.
---
You have to understand the fact that that was my first time on sabetha and first time entering a raid wing.I didnt blame them i actually asked if i should leave if im doing something wrong,they pointed my mistake out and i improved on it.
---
Meanwhile in Ebonhawke players are harassed by Vanguard Benni
---
I'm sorry your safespace has raids in them. I'm sure that ruins everything. Not like you cant just, idk, not do them.
---
Recently returned to the game and don't understand some new things. How should I farm Warclaw mount unlock (when it supposed to be like regular www, I suppose — roaming with a squad, doing things) when all squads already on mounts, of course, and I just cannot run with that speed. Neither I can farm it solo. I have no guild, no friends, I've always played alone.
---
Paying the chat channels attention is an understandable mistake, but a mistake nonetheless. The mode has always been organized around servers and as such the communities have been organized as server communities with access to server-level meta-communication.
---
Most people only treat /map and /team as an information flood. Think of it like the Matrix. The real life goes on on forums, discord servers and teamspeak servers. That is where those who play actively congregate and that is also where you can get help (where there is actual direct organisation to provide help with guides, instruction videos and other things) beyond the players generally being more helpful. That is also why people constantly tell new players to join those platforms.
---
I had not realized that this was fake and thought I would actually come back to the game since I thought it was all but dead. This is a very convincing fan made site. I also adore underwater/ocean themed stuff so I was ALL in.
---
They'll never cut WvW from the game. They'll just abandon it like dungeons.
---
ah look, that old eternal alchemy chart that keeps hinting at the idea of some piece of secret lore they have been waiting to reveal to us for like, 15+ years now? i used to think the floating tower of isgarren was where that secret lies but now its not even certain if that piece of content is even being developed still
---
It's just... so weird. The whole way they discussed how this is now a "saga" and not the typical living world we usually get, but didn't detail on how they were different other than we get a prologue and episodes one and two are part of one map. Until I read that the "saga"/living world episodes are still free I felt like they were hiding that the episodes were going to cost something now and there would not be expansions anymore. And even then, I still get the feeling like they don't want to tell us something about how "sagas" will work. Being vague to your consumers just invites speculation. It's just so.. so weird.
---
At least I would know what to expect and have something to look forward to. I already dont have a reason to log in. I expect slow raid releases from them, but I want to know it's at least something they're working on. Silence from them just makes me lose hope.
---
You get an entire extra expansion with PoF now and you’re seriously asking for more?
---
Fair point, didn’t think of scheduled tweet. Hopefully something will come.
---
Ideally, S1 would be free for everyone, and S2 free with any expansion.
---
This is episode 0, and free for all, so I'm pretty sure it will be at least 90% minigame with a friendly map without ennemy
---
I would not be discouraged. This subreddit is non-representative of the general player base, at least not its most vocal members. 
---
GW2 is a very casual, PvE-oriented game. If this is something you are looking for, you will have plenty of things to do for a very long time. I played for about 3 800 hours, but I am not even half-way through all available content. There are still legendaries to make, shinies to collect, achievements to complete, etc. I don't have much to complain about. I am sure there are plenty of players like myself who are very comfortable with the existing content and overall pace.
---
However, due to GW2's casual nature PvP/WvW, raids, and challenging modes are somewhat lacking in this game. And these are the most frequent complaints, especially from veterans with thousands of hours of gameplay. These complaints are not mere whining, they are quite justified, albeit people could be a bit more polite and slightly less emotional in expressing them. 
---
If you are a hardcore gamer looking for a challenge and constantly increasing levels of difficulty and required skill, GW2 might not be a game for you. But if you are looking for something more relaxing, family- and work-friendly, with focus on collections, GW2 is one of the best MMOs.
---
I also want to note that the GW2 community is very friendly and extremely helpful. The game design promotes cooperation and good spirit. This subreddit is no exception: Whenever you need advice or in-game help, you will find a lot of people here willing to come to your aid.
---
Nobody that raids wants this "content" where you drool on your keyboard while simultaneously wacking your head into your buttons just to pretend you're achieving something by beating content designed to be unfailable.
---
You already have this in fractals, openworld, dungeons and half the raids. At some point you gotta realise not everyone plays without their mouse plugged in.
---
They did, without the music tho.
---
Meanwhile in the Cyberpunk 2077 forum people rage about Gender options and why you cant pick a male transgender woman which is gay...
---
It was? must have missed it.
---
For what adventure exactly? Can't see any interesting things in the near future... :D
---
Hopefully in a few hours.
---
I'm not asking for Raids, Fractals, or whatever in this chain. I just think mini games and heart quests are basically the bottom of the barrel when it comes to creating a engaging map. Especially if it's supposed to be what launches a new Saga off.
---
Anet should have communicated with us if they were having problems.
---
One blog post every six months is not communication.
---
People had reasonable expectations after silence and announcements to expect expansion worthy features from lws5 in the lws5 reveal.
---
If anet could not deliver then they should not have promised, if something happened inbetween the original announcement and this one they should have communicated.
---
Chiefly, since they had nothing to announce, they should not have hyped it up.
---
&gt;Strange because reddit and the forums are literally the only places I'm seeing complaints. In game I see few. Most of my guild mates in my guilds aren't upset at all and think the vocal ones are overreacting. 
---
"Yes fellow human. Me and my fellow human players in our fellow human guild do not see what is wrong with this fine human game."
---
&gt;Some people are outright leaving the subreddit as they feel it's too toxic.
---
Link me some toxic threads then. 
---
See, this is the best way to tell a paid shill appart from a regular user. The instant they start crying about toxicity, all you gotta do is ask them to give some examples, and watch them fall flat on their face.
---
Surely, if its so toxic its making people leave you won't have trouble finding numerous examples of said toxicity in the frontpage.
---
&gt;That is incredibly offensive to dismiss my views as a "paid shill" and call me stupid because I don't agree with you.
---
Offensive to proper paid shills maybe. At least they put effort into their shilling.
---
Calling you a shill is the generous option, because the alternative is that you actually believe the bullcrap you're spewing.
---
same as twitch stream even an hour after it ended
---
This. Why should I spend my money anymore if im not playing or know if theres anything worth playing for except a shallow story every 4months that lasts 20min
---
That would thematically be in keeping with the krytan carnival being a front for the white mantle.
---
Well seeing how it's their main source of revenue I really don't see why we should complain. I'm happy people buy this stuff so I can keep playing the game.
---
Its nowhere near good as b4. Triple blink gone,triple portal gone,double mass invisibility for 20sec stealth is gone,aetherblade skip is extremely hard without cleanse on shatter,for thaumanova the skip is only possible with mirage now,cliffside skip is slower than b4, clutch group aegis is gone,you cant prestack in fractals now cause cant use cs without clones,that was 23sec of both alacr and quickness prestack all gone after the last nerf. On instanced content its completely useless .On open world its kinda okay but i just play power chrono there. Overall its crap compared to b4 the "trade off". It plays like ass and performs like ass.
---
Thanks for the honesty. Are there any comparable games (mostly combat wise) that you would suggest?
---
Depends on the items. I could see a bunch of minis, kites, transformation potions, maybe even a couple of skins. We've gotten some such stuff with pretty much every LS release since S3. 
---
Not the most exciting stuff of the century, but....
---
Working is hard, friends
---
i am one of the people flaming man. the game itself is fine. there is an insane amount to do and much of it has an awesome amount of replayability. our flames are being stoked by very different things that have been kinda building up for years now. it is just a pot of questions that havent been answered yet finally boiling over, it has more to do with the future of the game and the company Arenanet itself than what the game is now, which is very very worth playing.
---
Nothing to do with that. Race is just more work for every single skin in the game.
---
^ It's the new Broad-Horn Bull skyscale skin from  the New Horizons Mount Skin Collection
---
I believe it depends on which map you are on. (Only the maps that provide the boost, like Dragonfall)
---
This price will last to the end of the next week right?
---
As much as I wanted to give a positive opinion in spite of all the negativeness of these days, I can't lie, this video doesn't arouse me a tiny bit, on the contrary, it makes me wonder if these "funny looking places" fit the theme of the new map...which I would have preferred to have a more serious theme.
---
Go bazoombala ba-ba-bazoo bam bam-boo...Fool 'Em!
---
What would you like in the map, then?
---
Wasn't that kind of the point though? Having raid groups require a chrono is not good balance, IMO. Sure, players will always min/max and no one can stop that, but no one class should be *that* good.
---
Now i'm doing dragonfall and i don't have it :/
---
sadly, no. BDO has nice combat, but it has even less endgame, it's just pvp, fishing and trading simulator.
---
gw2 for what it's worth has nicest combat so far. that + the fluid animations is what keeps me playing 17k hours so far, but nowadays i only log in for daily fractals (short dungeons) and log out. there are raids but you only get rewards for them once a week, and they get boring (less engaging fights than fractals, bosses in raids are mostly stationary dps dummies)
---
you can try playing PoE if you're into those games - new league is coming out in 3 days, so thats good time to try it out. their company is vastly more professional and engaged with community than arenanet, and they have constant updates with new endgame systems
---
I mean I assume players like us that frequent the subreddit already have every LS unlocked from logging in and have already bought the expacs.
---
&gt;  No rep is going to spend their days reading posts that start with "Hey fuckfaces, I want this and I want this now!" and are 95% insults.
---
I have NOT seen any post like that.
---
All I have read here were pretty much polite comments, well explained thoughts from people that obviously care about the game. That is why I am always amazed when I see comments like yours. Where are these angry, rude posts? How do I missed them every day?  
---
Even more. ...I was stunned when I saw Rubi's tweet.  But if for her a joke or criticism equals rude comment... then I get it. Everything but kind words will be offensive. I really hope it was just emotional reaction and this is not the overall mentality at Anet.
---
maybe because the people who complain want the game to succeed and not die out due to lack of content?
---
100x less effort and way more masochistic gambling addicts. Its no surprise mobile games are so loved by developers who want nothing but money.
---
I mean you do gotta be honest with yourself though. This is failing to read the room.
---
Is it worth finding a download of this and giving it a go? I’m trying to find that magic feeling I had when I was playing GW2...
---
Multiple gifs and images were posted last week of this.
---
And there is no way to activate it?
---
If only i could throw all my legendaries in the mystic forge to unlock the possibility to buy that, then to buy the 80€ version... 
---
But having to buy 20€ a "saga" only to have LS content...
---
At least this one isn't another gif of the wiggling neck... But yeah, n^th post about this skin.
---
What you're saying is "I don't like the facts so I'm going to call them opinions, and replace them with my own misinformation".
---
Nobody is falling for it.
---
It's likely a bug. The effect probably has a timer and runs out, instead being permanent while on maps that give it.
---

---
I'm lost at finding a party for fractals.
---
The only thing I understand there is t1-4, but what are the other many abbreviations?
---
Support has given partial refunds in the past for situations like yours.  Definitely worth a shot.
---
Eve-Online 16 years and is not slowing down development.
---
Given that we had so much festival content, I understand a certain level of frustration (I also have some festival fatigue), but prologues to a story are usually somewhat minor in scale. I assume the kind of map you want is what we'll get with episode 1... hopefully November at the latest.
---
to bad that has monthlys
---
Its the developers being completely out of touch.  Gives me no hope really for the direction of the game and I dont feel like investing money and time getting back into it for me to be disappointed in a month.  Im sure the magic would suck me up in the beginning and theres a bunch of new content but Ill be caught up soon enough.  Especially with my gold supply.  
---
The negitivity, I dont care about.  Ive been around online gaming since collecting ears in Diablo and Hellfire (the first one) and its par for the course.  Idk if Id be as entertained with out the drama tbh.  
---
The product is 100% decaying and dying.  Its just a slow painful death.  I was wondering if they were gonna breath some new life into it.  Im not going to bother atm.  Going to keep an eye out though I think and see how this goes.  Maybe check back in 6 months from now.
---
About 100 WvW ability points is a hella lot for "a while" for me ^_^. All tags I've met today didn't wait for one slow player, well, I will try again, of course, but not sure how many tries my patience could endure. I had to do that mount when it was just announced with everybody but I did not play that time =_=.
---
Elite specs are inherently flawed and ultimately are going to need to be abandoned or removed. 
---
You simply cannot always design a new themed spec for every class, that isn't similar to another one you've done before, and even if you could, you'll run out of weapons. 
---
 Not to mention how limiting they are due to you only being able to equip 1 at a time.  And ultimately it will become unsatisfying because all of the focus will be on the elite specs, and the other non elite specs will be neglected.
---
You misunderstood me, but whatever.
---
The community is kinda split on this teaser and I sadly have to side with the negative one, because I doubt it is the kind of fun that holds you for more than 3 hours (not including the story.) A full on minigame gimmick map with games like Crab Toss is not what a player holds you and it is monumentally stupid to let us wait another 3 months for actual engaging content with the current situation. If that is all the map has to offer I see black. Let's hope not.
---
 I can't see myself playing Crab Toss for 2 hours, I doubt these minigames will.
---
That might be more if a twitter thing. It's compression is terrible
---
a game that has been given a renewed focus by the parent company that owns the ip, and you're trying to tell me, without even a source, that they want to stop giving major updates to the game, when the mobile games that were sapping resources was also being developed at the request of the parent company? okay. i am literally going to threads where people are asking about trying the game and making sure they understand that the game is fantastic, this boiling over of concerns is about where the game is going, not what it is now. Call it what you want, but being only passively concerned about the game, only being passively interested in it and treating it like a secondary thing to the other ways you entertain yourself that is only worth checking out when something free comes along is going to kill this game much faster than having criticisms about its future. 
---
Of course you would lump everything that isnt praise into the same boat. you are part of the communication problem, because you seem to only come around to say that wanting to communicate anything other than happy thankfulness is a form of rabid mouth-frothing uselessness. i wish we could block people on reddit.
---
Well as the old players leave the new players are going come in due to the BoGo ison the Expansion
---
And 8 months of angry mains...
---
it's a chonk
---
And until something gets done about it, the posts are valid.
---
And riding the Charr Tanks
---
Some would be happy with that, but folks that primarily play the professions getting their update in month 7 and 8 would be upset and feel cheated.
---
[This is a shot](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/thumb/9/94/Grothmar_Wardowns.jpg/800px-Grothmar_Wardowns.jpg) of the Blood legion homelands in GW1. They were very warm, autumnal forested areas.
---
&gt; So your argument is that you had a bad group last monday?
---
Last monday? Try last 6 months every monday. It's getting worse every month.
---
I said this a long, long time ago.
---
This game is barbie and ken for adults.  The goal is to make your character as pretty as possible with glowing stuff and show off to all the other dolls.
---
thats it
---
it is you, because it would be a terrible idea. that would be over 1 year with some class STILL not having new elite spec + unfair pvp balance.
---
I share anyway.
---
They really should of stuck with their original combat design...
---
Understandable.
---
O man, I miss my good ol' money-making shiverpeak runs on my Warrior!
---
 RemindMe! 1 year "loot this guy"
---
I actually don't see the asura taking a side if war broke out between humans and charr again. They didn't pick a side last time. Maybe they'd prevent the movement of troops through their gates, but overall, neutrality is more profitable for then. And I'm sure the Inquest would love to sell weapons and buy prisoners for testing from whomever is willing to deal with them.

Unless OP already has a set of ascended there is also a bootstrapping problem with t4 fractals.
---
I would love this so much. I love everything underwater in gw2, its so well done.
---
Not many games deal so great with underwater quests/ scenery/ combat like gw2 does.
---
It's pretty cool that people exactly describe how the profit motive of capitalism is ruining things like the games industry, but the moment it's pointed out some latent McCarthy lobe in the brain is triggered and everyone flips out.
---
i did this for a long time. My maintenance mode has degraded massively. I don't even play the story anymore. I just make sure I have it unlocked. Look, it's like that. When living story hit the fans, they wanted us to look at it like a tv series. But i didn't get hooked on the story too much. I enjoyed it when they dropped the first half of the "season" (speaking expansion) before continuing, slower. (Similar to some netflix releases, i think). I guess i wanted something to get myself excited for GW2 again.
---
Seems like i have to talk myself into believing that "It's not so bad". That is just not as good as "That's fun!"
---
Rec: daily recommended fractal. There are 3 of these, one in T1, one in T2, and one in T3
---
P+F: pots+food. Pots are the large [fractal potions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_Potion), food is utility items and food. They're asking you to bring your own. Also might see it as F+P, F&amp;P, or P&amp;F
---
Exp: experienced, they're looking for people who know the fractal mechanics so they don't have to teach/carry new players
---
BS: banner slave, it's a warrior who brings banners
---
FB/Ren: firebrand/renegade, asking for the support combination of firebrand and renegade.
---
I think those are the ones you'll see most often until you reach scale 100.
---
Once you hit that point, you'll also see
---
CM: challenge mote, these are harder versions of specific fractals. Generally associated with fractals 99 and 100
---
ESS/KP: unstable cosmic essence, it's an item you get from completing the 100 CM. This means that they're looking for someone who has done the CM enough times, and you're expected to ping it in chat when you join the group.
---
LNHB: leave no hero behind, it's the title earned from finishing CM 100 without anyone dying. Also used as a mark of experience
---
I might be forgetting something, so if anyone wants to add on to this I'd be grateful
---
Charr Car fights wut?  Seriously, you guys really chose the wrong stuff to show at the live event.
---
What do you want 100 for? You only need one to get the mount, and the upgrades that improve your speed are very minor(and add up to a total of 36).
---
took more effort than whole *theater* escapade.
---
Cause it should have been a Lamb of God concert with 5 clashing walls of death (4 leigons and everyone else)

Well, i guess we have different taste when it comes to Charr Zones and them being beautiful.

I got so fucking hype for a second and then realized this isn't real.
---
I want Blood Legion to have their own culture instead of being a Iron Legion copycat. Everything in this video doesn't say Blood Legion to me anywhere.
---
Tbh most people just play berserker in pve now as its like having another pure dps wirh banners. Other groups ignore warrior and just full DH.  In pvp/wvw warrior is good for brawling but spellbreaker can cover that niche just fine.
---
Even so its 1 class out of 10.
---
I wouldn't be so sad if it weren't a map dedicated to Blood Legion, the militaristic and war society. Not the tinkering and toys Legion.
---
social media makes people not aware of their own actions. Finding validation is all that matter for the ego mind and loosing identity is interpreted as death. This ego-self can't survive if it can't get its daily dose of validation that supposedly defines who you are. It creates a false self. We all suffer from it. This is a secretly hidden taboo topic because without the ego-self the hierarchic system we live could not exist. Admitting and releasing the ego-self would be condescending to people that you could say are higher in position/social standing because they as well, have an ego-self ie. an identity that is selfcreated and illusionary. People are getting taught this when they go through school. Only those who try to better themselfs through reading psychology books or have gone through extreme depression are sometimes able to experience what is called a deep moment of inner stillness. This is nothing spiritual. People think you cannot stop the flow of thoughts that are constantly bashing in but it is not true, they actually can be stopped, but the society doesn't teach you that, it does not give this knowledge on a silver plate. Social media makes it much easier to just not start learning about your ego-self. Even when you assumed social media is not designed to satisfy the ego's thirst for validation (lol), societies illiteracy and tabooing make any social media to be a place where the ego has an easy time getting fed in form of pain, inclusivity or validation.
---
wailing wankers need YOUR SUPPORT RIGHT NOW!
---
Yes, all those game devs making funko pops. Man what a waste.
---
You do realize this isn't an either or situation? I don't get why people get so shitty about merchandise - alternative revenue streams are nothing but good for the game. It also means they are getting money from something other than loot boxes.
---
We only win with this.
---
I'm with you about what should've looked that reveal. A fancy blogpost. 
---
I also waited elite specs, but let's being honest, I'm totally fine with the content they announced. They said now they have one more team, so we can expect kind of features packs in between.
---
Guild Wars Lore Rebuild : The Charr 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYRfbHZl8y8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYRfbHZl8y8)
---
So what is the solution? Let the gameplay rot?
---
Most of your listed issues only become problems once we get a 6th-7th spec for each class, and GW2 will long reach maintenance mode before that even happens (unless you believe this game is still going to get supported in 10 years).
---
We all knew Anet's priority was skins and outfits.  [The marketing guy dropped a big hint last week](https://i.redd.it/mc99auet6nj31.png) when he walked out on stage.
---
Imagine having both.
---
This should be a meme.
---
Every time Anet reveals new upcoming content:
---
"why wasn't this announced at the event?"
---
so youll still have to buy all the living world seasons between the expansions and the saga to get the whole story, huh?..
---
No I wouldnt suggest letting the gameplay rot.
---
Just return to how Gw1 was, atleast a little bit. 
---
Unforce a healing skill in slot 6, add 20ish skills for slots 789, rework existing elites because they're all lackluster.  Unforce a predetermined set of skills based on your weapon, add "Ranged attacks" and "Melee attacks" "Dagger attacks" etc, like gw1. And viola, you have much deeper build design and easier ways to develop new abilities.
---
Is Bangar actually generally xenophobic, or does he only hate humans? Humans and charr have a long history of bad blood and conflict, but they both get on fine with all the other races.
---
Upvoting for recent update! Was waiting for this under Hot...
---
Sometimes I agree with you but a 7-year-old account that posts in varied subs consistently seems like a lot of work for a shill.
---
Of course, they won't just giveaway the content worth like 4000 gems.
---
Ohhhh I get why you get 4000 gems for Ultimate - so you can buy all the Seasons!!!

I know what you mean, but I have no impact to other players. I can't change if people invite others to their home or not, so I can ignore it. Even if all inveted players affect the TP, it doesn't matter. It's just like all the other gold/mat sources (farming etc.), it's there no matter what I do.

*I* can only affect the people I invite to my home and that's not much.

These sort of things happen a lot in companies, so please don't start saying this happened because of all the controversy lately.

Nobody that raids seems to be not that many or we would not have hundreds of post on "how to join raid" or "why don't you raid". The point is not those who raid but those who don't
---
Also note that except "Capture a camp" you should be able to complete the whole collection in EotM where mounts are not activated if that can help you complete this iirc (but it's EotM so it's kind of a "pick your poison" kind of situation).
---
As for the points most of the other points are not that necessary and only a few (for speed) are really useful to be 100% sure to stick.
---
werent they selling the artbook which comes out next year?
---
Anet can't communicate if they have nothing to say. GW2 is understaffed. Nearly everything besides living world is in maintenance mode, or very close to it. They don't even have a team working on an expansion anymore. Nor one working on new elite specs.
---
So... why communicate? It's a much better strategy for them to stay silent and give their fanbase a vague hope that "things are being worked on, they just haven't told us yet!"
---
LW5, and the 4 fully-staffed LW teams with no expansion, were not a result of the lay-offs. That was planned for a long time, and the reestructuring happened during/ before LS4's episode 3. After the lay-offs happened, Anet never said, officially, that they were going to expand GW3's developet team size. They only said that GW2 would not be affected by the lay-offs and that their LW5 plans were preserved. It just so happens that their LW5 plans were already dictated on a smaller development team.

I take a big disagreement with this.  I think there is a difference between a game that is dying and a game that is coasting.  ArenaNet's simple problem is that they over promise and under deliver.  They just cannot provide content at a pace that the hard-core players would like.  I *am* one of those people, so I feel the pain.  That said, stuff still comes out, more stuff is coming out on the 17th.
---
I wish just ArenaNet would stop promising timelines and features; then, people would just accept the game for what it is: a game with an excellent combat system, best game experience for mounts (bar none), and a lot of events and places to participate in.  For new players, there is a tremendous amount in the game that has been built in the last seven years.  Just playing the stories alone is well worth the $30 (Core, Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire).  I have paid *a lot more* to get *a lot less* play value.  Plus, the game is free-to-play for the Core game.  I'm serious: there is a lot to see and experience just getting to 80.
---
Am I happy with ArenaNet promising stuff that was promised years ago?  No.  Am I surprised anymore?  No.  Just accept the game for what is: ArenaNet likes to sound like they are a Class A+ developer, but they're a solid B and always have been.
---
Listen I do not care about raids it is just fun how u seems not to see how obviously not enough people do them and so they try to do other way to bring people  in since most people seems to be not interested in how they are now.
---
The solution is not more raids or harder raids .
---
It's still a lot of fun to play today.  They even fairly recently patched it to improve the graphics a bit (increased draw distance and such).
---
What's their mistake?
---
I would have been happy with just them saying "expac 3 after IBS"
---
&gt; This line right here is why several companies limit their communication to customers (including every company I've worked for). Because, apparently, talking about potential features or things be worked on is the same as "promising". 
---
So... the line explaining how communication would have literally solved their problem pulling them out of this entire mess before it even happened... is the reason why don't communicate?
---
See, this is why I'm calling you a shill.
---
&gt;It's clear that you don't really care about listening to people that may have other insight besides what you want to hear.
---
You don't have insight any to offer though, all you have bullshit that's so transparent its not even trying.
---
Strike Missions will never be an introduction to raids even if they are hard. They don't give kill proofs, they don't teach players about each boss mechanics. And if I said to the raid leader that I have no raid experience but lots of Strike Mission experience he would kick me. Only raids can teach raids.
---
It is not botting. You login, manually collect some magic, do your daily collect daily chests from a JP and daily login chest and exit it's 55 laurel a month plus mystic coins plus dailies. U do not need to bot
---
Play it. It's still fantastic, the issues the community has has nothing to do with the quality or state of the game, especially in regards to you and new players. 
---
I will say that the core game content is not nearly as good as expansion level content and above (HoT and all the living story stuff). I recommend taking your time with the game and leveling, but if you get to a point where you start getting frustrated with the personal story or bored with the game (this typically happens around level 50), don't be afraid to skip ahead to 80 and start HoT. 
---
If you want the most out of the story, play through the personal story + dungeons, followed by season 2, HoT, Season 3, PoF, and season 4 and also fractals throughout. If you find yourself getting bored by early stuff, skip all the way to HoT and move forward from there.
---
Seems that way. I'm assuming when it's described people are like "oh yeah that's bad", but the moment that description is given an accurate label, logic flies out the window because of the specific label given despite it being accurate. I'd say it's probably just because of some kind of blind brainwashed devotion to capitalism, or blind brainwashed negativity against anything that isn't capitalism.
---
One of the people who responded to me attempted to argue semantics by saying "T-that isn't capitalism, that's "corporativism" silly.", so the shoe fits.
---
It sounds like she is going to something she is excited about. Good for her.
---
Your biggest mistake is checking this sub. Download the game and play.
---
It is disgusting by all means. And you are right in what you said,we have the most boring meta atm.
---
I wonder if maybe thats the problem, if Guild Wars 1 made a comeback like WoE Classic people would blow up the servers, I guess people dont appreciate what they have or more like many people come back to the game at different moments which isnt enough to fill the servers.
---
Also to note, based on her [job history](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Samantha_Wallschlaeger) Samantha seem to move between projects at different companies frequently, *a la* the gig economy.
---
What's happened to his daughter taking over his work?

Guild Wars Charr Lore ReBuild [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYRfbHZl8y8&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYRfbHZl8y8&amp;t)
---
Wow, I mean, everyone's entitled to their opinion. Weeb culture isn't something I dabble in. I don't watch anime and I certainly don't get an erection over ramen noodles, Japanese cars or the emperor of Japan for that matter. You seem triggered, have a seat, drink some tea.
---
obviously not, because it switched weapons in the demonstration, which means the templates can be applied to things that can't be customized into something else.
---
I imagine it will work based on what you have in your inventory and if that can be used to recreate the template, wether it's ascended, exotic, or masterwork.
---
If you don't have legendary sigils and runes, however, you'll have to keep multiple armor sets with the correct ones socketed.  This is totally logical and the way we always thought it would work.  But yeah, people are going to get mad about it.  Fuck them.  who cares.
---
I love how absolutely everyone in here expects the shitshow to start. OMG DED GAEM PPL LEVING THE SINKING SHIP.
---
I stopped playing gw1 the same reason why I stopped in gw2, I have no more space on character literally every char slots is filled and incoming birthday presents arent helping, gw2 is the worst since half of the shit isnt sellable.
---
Troll 4/10. Try again later. Do you need a coin to insert in the slot machine "my dude"?
---
just sub a month before expansion and the expansion month to enjoy about 50-60 hours worth of story. for 13$ +expansion price ofc, there is no better value imo
---
yikes most the people in this thread sound like they don't wanna play an mmorpg but a single player game instead.
---
Most people bot that because it is impossible to get caught.
---
Now imagine having multiple accounts and doing that.
---
If this follows the trend for the other sales as part of the Anniversary, then it will last until Friday, September 6th,  8:59 am Pacific.
---
Ended up buying from DLGamer and yes I did get Heart of Thorns also.Thanks to everyone who helped!
---
big oof :(
---
Not just a chonk, but a triple chonklit chip.
---
And instead those articles are about the troubles in gw2
---
I literally see none of those on this thread
---
Keep an eye on the lfg they have training raids and so do some guilds
---
Lmao
---
Hello no please no under water!
---
You had dev communication with player to the list
---
WvW'ers would descent like locusts down on the forums if Anet *dared* to implement a new map.
---
Can't say anything about PvP. I guess more modes and general QoL updates would be nice. Let me watch games, follow players, regular stuff.
---
Fractals already have four different difficulties. Give the fucking same to raids for God's sake, stop living in 2006. Also: open world elite maps. The further you progress, the harder it gets.
---
**Don't you dare tone down Living Story in favour of expansions.**
---
You should still be able to buy the Living World Season 3 Complete Pack. The gem price is prorated based on episodes you already own, e.g. the base price for the complete pack in your case should be 800 gems, which will be 520 gems after discount.
---
Having the physical copies of the game actually saved my account once during a very strange error. My password was *removed* after a large patch, not changed, simply deleted. I had to talk to Anet support and provide my game codes that came with the physical copies to prove it really was me.
---
Youre putting words in my mouth, read the rest of the discussion and try to understand the Argument before getting upset.
---
Power hungry mods don't need public reports to be power hungry. It wouldn't make a difference.
---
It is you. I do have a main with its profession. I am not interested in any more elite specs. What I would like most is the broken stuff on the existing professions to be fixed (and I am not talking about balancing here which is a separate issue, but the really broken things), and then would like content to play with that character.
---
if you're looking for a mmorpg with a long future i would try elsewhere, if you're looking for a mmorpg with a good endgame i would also try elsewhere, if you're looking for a mmorpg where you don't have to really interact with people and can play the game mostly single player then this is the game for you.
---
I hope they fixe it fast

 [https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) 
---
Snow crows has links to the raid training disocrds. I haven't been on the raid training discords in awhile and members of the community could probably give you an idea which is more active. This is probably the best way to get your feet wet in raiding.
---
Fair enough.
---
They could still just drop the elite specs without tying it to new story though. They could all be inspired by the recent events, us being Aurene's champion, or Aurene becoming an ED.
---
I'm out of the loop. What happened recently that everyone is in an uproar over? I haven't been keeping up with gw2 lately.
---
what is pointing out you're a rambling idiot punishable by law now? Sorry it was too painful to read your incoherent babyrage XD
---
Coming from MHW, I imagine you like to play games thoroughly, repetitively, and for longer periods of time. You enjoy when there's something new to do, but aren't concerned about doing that new thing for a while to get the stuff you want. You like your combat varied, with a distinct difference in gameplay depending on your gear choices, and to hit for big numbers. If all or most of these things are true, you will probably not have a problem playing GW2. Despite the absolute tantrum being thrown by some of the more entitled members of the community, the game is perfectly fine for people who want to sink some time into some casual, if sometimes repetitive content for anywhere from a few hours a day to a couple of minutes a week. Combat is great, build diversity is interesting and varied, and it's the most alt-friendly game on the market, and has been for a while.
---
Don't marathon content, pick a collection of weapons or armor to work on from time to time, and if you find yourself getting bored with a class, pick a different one or shuffle your build a little bit. Welcome to the game.
---
No, we already knew the expansion boost event was happening.
---
Remember the amount of complaints when the Desert Borderlands were added? Even with them trying to fix them, nobody would fight on them.
---
First thing you need is quite a bit of time, dont expect this to be fast or easy. Get your build from snowcrows, watch Boss kill videos, e.g. from MightyTeapot, then put up your own training lfg group, it will fill in a few minutes. Get your whole team on discord or another voice chat and then enter the raid and progress it with players just like you that want to get into raiding. It will take a few hours for your first boss kill, but you will learn the fight and tactics eventually.
---
Tl;dr; Do NOT expect to get carried by experienced players as a new player,  get a squad of other new players and figure raid bosses out with them!
---
And if they'll do, they'll confirm the worst. That's my point.
---
Both are abstract and need figureheads if they are to be treated as people.
---
I would dare saying that 'GW2 community' as used in the title does not exist, as in, what clashed was not the GW2 community. At most it were some of the GW2 communities - maybe important ones but that's not the matter. The interests that were thrown around were all but common (unless trying the 'No True GW2 Fan' approach).
---
And while in some cases the legal entity was attacked (mounts come to mind) during the last days the struggle was apparent to put figureheads -or scapegoats- onto that thing born of paper and money that nobody is strong enough to hurt given the financial size of NCSoft.
---
If anything a company is a community with a legal status. So if a community is people unified behind a common interest, a company is people unified behind a common interest and a legal status.
---
How did they fuck THAT up?
---
You want a core for consistency, so you don't end up with inconsistencies and a story that's all over the place, but with content delivered like the seasons of a TV series, you also need fresh ideas.
---
TV shows get guest writers all the time.
---
If you want to play dps please practice dps rotation before joining your first squad. 
---
Golem: 4 million hp, huge hitbox, 25 vuln
---
You: All boons (except when using a class that gives +% damage per boon), all ranger buffs, banner of strength and of discipline.
---
you mean rocket league GW2 style? :D
---
&gt; and because I wanted to get into raids anyway
---
And theres the point. Communities dont grow large by having already dedicated People join, they grow by getting uninformed people interested. 
---
GW2 barely ever requires a guild, and only few players even consider informing themselves outside of games - especially when the game is casual-friendly. 
---
When those casual players try to get into raids they dont search the wiki, the reddit or ask around in the aerodrome - they join the lfg. Its what theyve always done and what the game teaches them. 
---
Im not even defending their actions - its bad habits from multiple sides that cause(d) this situation and ANet should have done something against them a long time ago!
---
for 90x60 I understand the price, what I usually find on the net is way smaller than that.
---
At the golem 15k is just autoattacking.
---
It is...for people who lack reading comprehension.
---
FF14 devs said in interview that sub allows them release content at faster pace. You can check tht numbers in their investor reports.  
---
Monthly sub is one of the fairest monetization schemes, imo.
---
Actually no,the sub fee is a massive reason the game is so good. There is a stable and much higher revenue and stability means good working environment,strict and plentiful release schedules and ofc you can put lots of ingame rewards that dont conflict with game store. I mean anet literally cant put good skins ingame cause it kills their gem store profits.   Id gladly pay anet subscription if it meant hiring more devs and provide regular content for all game modes+ expansions...
---
&gt; rework the fractals of the mists so that each fractal has it's own difficulty scaling. Players select the fractal that they wish to run and the difficulty scale of it (1-10?). AR requirement, difficulty and the rewards all depend on the level chosen. Max level should have a challenge mote. This system makes it simple to just drop in new fractals without reorganizing the tiers.
---
Efforts would be better spent fixing existing ones such as the AoE spamfest in the more recent ones. Also the instabilities, like actually spend some time thinking about how they interact with each section of each fractal.
---
&gt;  Also, get rid of the daily system. If anything, we should get a repeatable reward achievement for completing all fractals on a max tier and another for CMs. (similar to dungeons) 
---
because this worked so well for dungeons?
---
&gt; We need unranked/ranked 2v2s or 3v3s, whatever is easier to balance. Who cares about splitting the population, at this point it doesn't really matter anymore. The new mode should have it's own leaderboard, titles, legendary rewards, etc, ... All the shinies that attract PvE players into it. 
---
They aren't doing a great job even with what we have now. You think things will be better with an even higher work load?
---
&gt; More balance updates AND skill splitting. All elite specs should be viable at the high-end competitive level. 
---
same as above
---
&gt; Alliance system, duh. What this means I don't really know, but I hope the guilds will play a big role in it. 
---
I haven't really thought much about this before but now that I have, I predict failure for this. Not necessarily through a fault of ANet although there is room for that too.
---
If they allow the alliances to get too big then there will be a problem with permanent lopsided sides. Maybe this already exist in which case the problem will simply persist which would also mean no improvement in this area.
---
Regardless of what values ANet decides on for the sizes there will also  be plenty of complaints about the size being too large along with complaints about the size been too small. That is just how this game's population works. Anyone trying to provide a more well rounded argument about how the size should be determined will simply be drowned out by a pile of circular arguments about why it is wrong.
---
Bobby Stein has been there since 2005, so I think they've got that covered.
---
i don't see a single comment in this post expecting that, its all good wishes but nice narrative pushing.
---
Okay, I had to read that like five times before I realized that they're talking about previous expansions, not about the Saga.
---
Yeah, this isn't "newsworthy". Writers also move a lot.
---
In gw1? Like a hundred years before when Charr were a tribal race?
---
there is no standard for fun though.
---
Sunken time fallacy.
---
They aren't "only" public, you can do them privately. I think it will be like the Dragon Bash Arena, from what I understood during the announcement.
---
I was with you for the most part until the 80 to 90 thing. I don't want any more vertical progression than we already have. 
---
I could take or leave cantha as a location for the next xpac as well.
---
Hell, I could take no more expansions ever, provided they prove that sagas can deliver anything an expansion can. This has not yet been proven, and probably wont be proven until elite specs or new weapon types are revealed for a saga/season.
---
bruh the [TINY] guild invades DR all the time.
---
they should have added invisible walls all across these places from the get go
---
I guess it's not obvious enough that I talked about how people expect it, but it's clearly not happening.
---
Yeah, I think that was one of the last major changes to WvW.
---
It is because of all those stupid ghosts, Branded and Flame Legion.
---
It all makes sense now
---
PRAISE
---
I think it's more of PvP queue where you maybe can go there alone or with a friend.
---
Otherwise people will just organize groups for harder achievements like in TT, and that is not fun and it is just like organising a raid, so no.
---
IMO even wvw players don't truly know what they want :) We had the same borderlands for the past 7 years, if I logged into wvw I would choose desert BL just for the change of scenery. I do agree with you on the pvp, everyone should be able to spectate ATs. The fractal idea is basically to simplify the tiers and make them more accessible to new players (no more dailies, just choose a fractal, difficulty and play). 
---
&gt; open world elite maps. The further you progress, the harder it gets. 
---
I don't see anet putting resources behind this, BUT, if they reused open world maps for a raid-like 10 man content, hmm... Could work.
---
As long they don't mean friends as random people you just met, I'm ok with that.
---
. . .
---
Yes, because developing content for the game has *next to nothing* to do with developing content for the game....
---
Wow.
---
This is next level shilling.
---
If you actually have to call out people for proper grammar as a means to "talk back" then i feel sorry for you. ThIs aInT a GrAmMar CoNtEsT.
---
U can see that xpacs are very big bump in tbere overall sales
---
&gt; The developers are not eternally locked in place and could without problem be moved to producing content. Work hours that could be spent working on content but are used for gem store items do definitely decrease the output of actual content.
---
Than we get a few more armor sets instead of bunches of outfits, wow.
---
So from what I'm seeing, every two years since around the Twilight Assualt or Tower of Nightmares update of LS1 (which was when the world maps started permanently changing with events), we see an increase in earnings, then a decrease before stabilizing, then another increase with an expansion, then a decrease before stabilizing again. Sounds like this year should be the increase, depending on how good the Icebrood Saga is, if this pattern holds up.
---
&gt; because this worked so well for dungeons? 
---
Dungeons were abandoned by the company, that's what killed them. When they added repeatable rewards it was already too late. I don't like the current daily system in the fractals and anything would be better than that. 
---
&gt; They aren't doing a great job even with what we have now. You think things will be better with an even higher work load? 
---
It's high work load for what? 2-3 pvp devs? If they wanted to support the pvp they would had to put resources (devs) behind it. Anything else is just misleading the community.
---
I won't pretend to know how the alliances should work, but if you add seasons behind it and offer incentives for people to overthrow the top alliance, transfers in the off seasons,... GvG could work in this situation, guilds would most likely regulate the size.
---
I guess there are limits to the changes Anet is willing or capable of doing. They did change the desert borderland quite a bit before implementing it, and then continued to change it around a bit. But they didn't completely revamp it. It's safe to assume that the budget doesn't allow for such things. You have some wiggle room, but it's not going to magically turn into a wish list of a major overhaul, effectively quadrupling development effort.
---
Especially when things are that subjective. You have that REALLY loud minority that conjures up a shitstorm whenever the devs as much as cough in the general direction of WvW, but they CAN'T develop solely for *these people*. Neither should they, actually.
---
So yeah... We'll see, I guess.
---
What the heck happened between 1Q16 and 2Q16 that the earnings dropped harder than they ever had before so quickly?
---
I'd rather have Tengu as the new race if  they ever add one. I demand bird people. I've wanted them since GW2 was announced and I still want them.
---
This. I'll play the new story chapter and sometimes do a few metas and daily login, but I've basically stopped playing without ever committing to not play. There's just nothing exciting.
---
No because the post is ridiculous. Spitting on the anger is the worst move.
---
This isnt a WvW post....get back to NSP and take back middle fort
---
I agree with your points, but I'm not sure how it would resonate with players (like me) who played it since 2012, suddenly having to pay monthly or all content and characters I've worked on across the years become locked...
---

I kinda see them like cross of cat and dog. Dog-like ears(some look like rabbits), fangs(actualpy prolly closer to a shark), and nose; cat-like personality(curious and a bit of an asshole) and eyes(mostly due to the premium eye with cat looking pupils). I see asuras as catdogs.
---
This chart is massively skewed because of release.
---
Most of the burning is because of my fellow 7 year veterans who have just run out of stuff to do....You can EASILY put thousands of hours into this game...( Im sitting at 11,000+)
---
This. One of the conditions to ANet allowing my templates extension was that I let it die when an official solution comes around, and that condition hasn't changed
---
That's a quality shitpost.
---
Also, in the name of my own friends who come from MonHun, "Big Weapons" is often a request when browsing the classes. Warrior and Guardian tend to have the best single-swing melee, but I'm a big fan of greatsword ranger for that exact purpose. If you play enough to consider purchasing an expansion, necromancer Reaper from HoT has a lot of real big swings, all greatsword as well.
---
I'd wager I'm more pessimist than reality.
---
someone posted this before https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ckibg0/watching_the_steven_universe_movie_trailer_and_i/
---
the company making stable earnings does not strictly imply a healthy game. they are rotating through new waves of customers with limited interest, while veterans and fan resources slowly dwindle away, affecting the tone of thhe entire community in the long run. sure, the game isn't dying, and e.g wvw will *technically* still be playable with a single player per side, but arguements against gw2 being a rather deflated shell of itself become rather hard to find. it's not dead, maybe not even dying, but it isn't all that alive or well either thanks to continuous mismanagement.
---
a cash cow barely held conscious enough to serve its purpose.
---
unless we know the cost to make them as well, kinda irrelevant
---
it was the hot release
---
NCSoft analyst looked at this and thought: looks like we get by just fine with gem shop sales during living world releases. The team that worked on expansions at the same time as the living world teams didn't make much profit through box sales to justify its existence. Guess we cancel expansions, fire some people, push the gem shop a bit harder and integrate the expansion team into Living World development. Maybe we should rename the whole thing and nobody will notice. Sagas sound good.
---
I kinda skipped this subreddit last week because of the whole announcement drama
---
I agree with you.  So much to do and with the expansions even more to do.

The first warband, led by Olma, to desert and march south was Flame Legion. During their march they picked up warbands from other legions though. But the "first of the Olmakhan" (before they were called such) were Flame Legion, and that's why Olmakhan are such heavy magic users - except they denounced fire magic and studied the other elements of magic.
---
Heart of Thorns expansion was released on October 23rd, 2015, and thus would fall into 2015 Q4. 2016 Q1 probably still had lots of purchases from new players and the holdouts who gave in to the temptation of the expansion. Then you get the drop-off that follows every big release. I know some folks quit after HoT dropped so that may also have contributed.
---
&gt;so they see and fix it
---
Ha.....ha......ha................
---
I wanted to include it though. You want another one starting at 1Q13?
---
Nor does it imply a dying game. But the areas of the game I play seem healthy. My guild seems healthy. I'm not seeing people logging in for significantly less hours, even long time vets. Because we're a casual guild. The ratio of casual to hard core players will make some different. Strangely, I think casual players are less likely to start over somewhere else, because they're not quite so willing to invest the start over time/energy. I'm not really willing to start another game, because I'm happy here.
---
The reddit community is not the in game community and never has been. Plenty of times things are being said here on reddit that I have to explain over and over again to my guild, because they take a look and have no idea what's going on.
---
You seem to be laboring under the assumption that this game doesn't have an actual demographic of players that it fits. I think you're wrong. I think that demographic is large enough to keep it stable.  Is that healthy? It is if you're part of that demographic.
---
A prediction is not a point. what is it you think I missed? also wondering how you define "veteran," as this sub has had this kind of polarized discussion for years
---
you should just submit these as a portfolio and join their QA team as a lead position
---
that or join whichever team makes jumping puzzles

Damn, hype was real at release.
---
I've hit 10k HP/S sustained (over a 60s period) on high damage spam world bosses. ARCdps lets you track personal outgoing healing. It is indeed the best healer in terms of pure output, but it achieves this through breaking the 5 man target cap. Revenant can heal a 5 man party for more. Scrapper also use to do more, but the loss of healing on superspeed/swiftness dropped its output some.
---
Arcane 3, 1, 1. Water 3, 2, 3. Tempest 1, 1, 3. 
---
Tempests big call to fame IMO is the fact that it can drop 1.5k HP/S on 15 people, while still burst healing. This however is an utterly useless skill except for memeing on world bosses, or for personal enjoyment in a map queue wvw blob.
---
Everything else it does can be done better by another class.
---
Its a good time for a new player,probably the best as you get both expansions for the price of one and you will have massive content on your hands that will last years.
---
The negativity is mostly about veteran end game stuff,people that played for about 5-7 years and have been stuck with little content. But that shouldn't concern you if you are new i would pick up the game in an instant.
---
Okay despicable then, same thing still haven't seen any examples of that so it'd be great to see some.
---
Yes it is just you.
---
The reason why they decided not to go for another expansion after PoF was because were working on other the 2 projects that JP mentioned on her tweet and that were canceled.
---
My point was that I think people are reacting out of proportion. They’re blaming anet for “hyping” them up too much, when they’re fully responsible for their own emotions. It’s one thing to say that the live stream and count down were excessive and disappointing for the content of the announcement, but I’ve seen numerous posts and comments where people directly blame anet for how hyped they got and /that’s/ what they’re upset about. Also the amount of entitlement because of being a veteran player. Lots of people completely ignored any content of the actual announcement and said that veterans got nothing. I’m fine with people expressing disappointment but the way many people have done so has come off as incredibly selfish and entitled. 
---
I consider a veteran anyone who has played the majority of the game content or played for a couple years or more.
---
Idk what took them so long but I guess better late than never .
---
I miss those giant lakes and all the krait
---
Yes. As time goes out from an expansion the earnings go down. That was true of the last expansion too.  But since we've had lower sales 3 years ago and the game is 3 years older, what that's saying is that the game is stable. Meaning year on year it doesn't seem to be losing steam. That's exactly what stable means.
---
Businesses don't run on quarters. When I ran my business you worried about year on year and you knew certain events skewed numbers.  So you factored in those events.
---
From a business perspective, these are stable numbers. Did Anet lose money a year further out from an expansion. Of course it did, just as WoW did.
---
However, the game is still making more income than 3 consecutive quarters in 2016, 3 years ago.
---
You seem to be a crazy person and not in a good way.
---
Thanks. I was on break around HoT launch and didn’t know they announced a second expac right then. I actually though these were only conjectures up until the August announcement for a September release, so an expansion in about 2 years would have still made sense, which it does less now. Really hope they kick it up with the expansion worthy content with that saga thing then...
---
&gt; haha you are a fool, you can't even argue with a rabid dipshit frothing at the mouth
---
sorry I don't speak the language of clown world
---
You answer your own question. Anet always have lack of communication and it got even worst after HoT when they announce more that they can deliver.
---
IMO Anet is just playing the silence card until product are ready to drop. This way they cannot create fake hype but they didnt do hype too. And it seems like people didnt like not getting hype...
---
wow.not a single word for the songs?have u ever watched a single episode ? ansqwer:no
---
They are, though? Like this isn't even something they're working on, they're just licensing the IP and probably have final approval but it's not like anet is making the Pops themselves. Funko is.
---
Chimp is a racist term for black people, that phrase specifically has a racist history.
---
Came here to say this.   
---
I don't want new players to feel discouraged just bc 90% of this subreddit is in flames. Not all of us are upset!
---
I liked that it created nice corridors of activity and didn't leave the map overly busy.
---
I just wish they had managed to work out a good alternative to the orb of power system. In play it was a fun mechanic, but it needed some tweaking and a game that wasn't so easily broken / hacked.
---
I just remembered what the old bots used to be like -laughs-
---
Subs will always be the best payment method for MMO's and why all the most successful MMO's have had them.
---
Did you respond to the right comment? Lol
---
its newsworthy in the sense that its something different to talk about then negativity.
---
It's a cartoon on Cartoon Network. It's actually really good.
---
&gt; but if you add seasons behind it and offer incentives for people to overthrow the top alliance
---
that is why the size is crucial otherwise why beat them when you can join them?
---
the correct mmo term is skilling to encompass non related combat activities where you train a vocation, fishing isn't a craft. You are obviously ignorant on the subject matter as selling packs to npc's required husbandry and farming to make a larger profit. Not to mention the in game activities related to delevering goods for more money in enemy territory via ships or land mounts. It was not just click and deliver to sell. On the other hand gw2 skilling is basically just a gold sink that provides no purpose other than crafting ascended or legendary which is arguably not necessary for 90% of content.
---
That's great to hear, thanks for the reply. I have seen that the expansion sets are bogo right now but I wanted to try out the game before doubling down on the expansions to make sure it scratches the itch. I would hate to wait until this weekend though, realize I love the game and miss out on the sale. Do we know how long the sale will go on for or is it a crap shoot?
---
&gt; It is better to use the Victorious Dye Kit (week 2) before Unlocks
---
Depends on which dye you plan on unlocking.  A 400g-700g dye wouldn't be the worst thing to pull out of an Unlock.
---
Gonna need a source. After that, edit the wiki with that information.
---
Well, yeah. That's what happens when players take things too far to the point where Anet devs need additional security at PAX.
---
https://twitter.com/Gaohmee/status/1168606141145743365?s=19
---
Why would you communicate *anything* when there will always be someone unsatisfied enough, no matter the situation, to lead to issues like the one above?
---
Because it's straight up not going to be expansion quality. No new elite specs, still no new race, no new ways to play the game, and no new raid wing or fractals. Swiss style pop tournaments and WvW restructuring have been talked about for years as content coming to the game.
---
This essentially shows that the games revenue is significantly stable since the original release and the chance of Anet giving up on it is pretty low.
---
But they do realize that if they wish to increase profits overall they're going to have to change things up.
---
Online games need to be meaningful in one way or another, or there's just no reasons to play them. Rewards and prestige are weak, because the gem store has way too much influence, and both replayability and player-driven activities have been at an all-time low for a few years already.
---
Hopes and dreams were the only things keeping this sinking boat afloat.
---
You forget about Aurene?
---
The game is best played unspecialized; as a PvX sampler.  The more varied you play the game the more satisfied you'll be.
---
Except Anet actually responds to those
---
ESO is clunky AF having a charged autoattack on every weapon.
---
It feels clunky and the animations are shitty.
---
Glad you found something you enjoy though.
---
Charr zones have permanent autumn, which is my favorite season. Beautiful.
---
I did not know that but nice :D
---
They tried that already.
---
Some of those skills, and traits, ar now well used, but it was still a boring addition, just felt like a balance patch.
---
2 expansions for the price of one is permanent as the company is creating maps with masteries from both expansions and didnt wanna keep players away if they miss one of two. Idk anything about other sales atm.
---
Please, come to our event.
---
Why you mad? This event wasn't for you!
---
We get more gem store stuff, but I"m personally buying less, so I'm not sure how that matters. The stuff I really want, more shared slots, I can't get. I have enough mount skins now. There is such a thing as a saturation point.
---
Sure there's more gem store stuff, but people not playing won't be buying.  You're trying to say the game is doing about the same as it did in 2016, but now it's dying when all the gem store stuff that would make a difference is more cosmetics?  More gathering tools? how many sets of infinite gathering tools do you think most people buy?
---
This is not a strong argument in my opinion.
---
Its just not happening. Gw1 at its core is a totally different beast. The maps were instanced, not "open world" as they are today. 
---
Gw1 had GvG from the start, it was designed around that. In Gw2 it has been 7 years and if GvG ever gets implemented, it will certainly not play into guild halls the way you expect, will however most likely be linked to a pvp game mode or WvW alliances.
---
They do acknowledge it. Even have a npc named wikki.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scholar_Wikki
---
&gt;IMO Anet is just playing the silence card until product are ready to drop. This way they cannot create fake hype but they didnt do hype too. 
---
That's literally what they did with the rented out theater. They created massive ammounts of hype because they didn't even rent a theater for PoF.  Only for HoT, which was a massive announcement as it was the first expact.
---
After 6 months of silence people were expecting that to mean something.
---
&gt;And it seems like people didnt like not getting hype...
---
I've really gotten sick of this bullshit argument "Its all the players fault."
---
People don't like being kept in the dark, and they don't like being bullshited. Unless you're incompetent, both things are easy  to avoid.
---
Take a look at warframe and digital extremes. 
---
Railjack was announced more than en entire year ago, and the game has been in a pretty dire content drought  since profit taker's release. People aren't making doom and gloom posts there because the company is open and communicates the progress with bi-weekly devstream.
---
There's none of this "PLayers doN't LikE NoT GeTtiNg hYpe" bullshit.
---
If management is so incompetent that they are afraid of communicating because they don't want to commit to something they can't deliver, but when the time comes to actually deliver on THEIR conditions (i.e. complete secrecy) and they fail to deliver on that too, then how can you blame it on the players?
---
And PoF's hype was thanks to leaks.
---
The best moments in GW2 history have always been unintended by ArenaNet. Let that sink in.
---
15k gets you kicked on most bosses
---
Ok so you are explicitly part of the problem. Good to know.
---
If 90% of the subreddit says otherwise, maybe we are wrong then and you are correct. I guess the 10% can continue to keep gw2 alive
---
Nope not how you read earning reports if you're talking about earning reports that spike. It's not quarter on quarter. It's quarter on quarter out from an expansion. That's what I meant when I said events that skew results.
---
Sales spike during expansions and gradually go down. You'd have to compare not year on year but year on year after hot and year on year after PoF to get a better idea. That's how it works if you factor in the entertainment business, not just business.
---
Insta-buy is what that is.
---
Which can turn quickly into a wasted time fallacy. The pendulum can turn the other way around in any moment, and it won't be turning back for a long time, if ever.
---
I'd take new weapons, we don't need a million skins for them and they're just 5 skills as opposed to a whole elite spec.
---
Land spears, Flails, Crossbows, Artifacts (That float.) etc.
---
Pretty much what make MMO goodfor building communities.  Dungeon, Fractal , Raid , PVP , WvW.
---
Now we get tons of Public stuffs. with no progresstion except farming for gold to convert to gems and gem pretier stuffs.
---
Yeah, silence is always worse than the truth. They're digging their own grave.
---
That's really not a surprise. The biggest boom is always at release. It's rare for something to have a mellow launch and then steadily rise from there due to word of mouth.
---
If you want a place call home,  know that gw2 is like a super mansion.  The journey itself is fantastic,  but it is destined to go down in flames once you've exhausted the gameplay. Updates are infrequent
---
Remember "challenging group content" from HoT's announcement?
---
I mean, how hard was it to just announce raids? What kind of stupid game are they trying to play here?
---
I've been playing ESO and WoW just for kicks and haven't spent any money in a while. I'll continue down other paths until such time they change their ridiculous policy of not sharing real honest information and their long term plans, but until then I won't be spending my time or money with Anet. It's their loss long term, not mine and they have only themselves to blame regardless of how often they try to paint the community with one broad brush stroke!
---
No1 cares what language you do speak, so take your high strung attitude and there's the door.
---
I think festivals are one of the best things in this game. Just not everyone's cup of tea I guess.
---
he's talking about the command. ofc they acknowledge the wiki itself, it's their own site.
---
There's a ton of stuff to do for a new player, literally hundreds of hours of content, but if you look for challenging instanced content (5-man dungeons, or 10-man raids), you might get disappointed after a while. There are 8 long dungeons with multiple paths, ~20 short dungeons (each taking 10-15m for semi-experienced team), and 7 raid wings with 2-4 bosses in each + some events. Progression from ground zero might take some time, but once you do everything, you'll be stuck with depressing release cadence. Dungeons are not updated anymore, new fractal is once every 6 months, new raid - 9-10 months.
---
So enjoy the content while it lasts, there's a lot of fun.
---
Profits cannot increase indefinitely. Net growth forever is unachievable. Stability like this is actually pretty decent, and hopefully we'll see another rise due to a renewed focus.
---
&gt;Actually, I don't think the board members are so worried either
---
Didn't they nuke a good chunk of the company some months ago to better profits?
---
Char Charr Charred Charrming Charr
---
It goes on sale from time to time. I think I picked it up for like $20 US several months back.
---
Even without the leaks and the Datamine information. They reveal and create a lot of hype by themself but that backfire on them.
---
Youre still able to upgrade to hot deluxe edition from gem store.
---
Quality replaced by political correctness, the defining design principle of both Andromeda and GW2.
---
Damn... you're right. Although this gives a good rough idea how GW2 affects the company financially. But shouldnt that be public info?
---
You are just making a very personal and subjective analysis here.
---
Objective analysis is done like OP said, comparing quarters to their previous year counterparts. That's all there is to it.
---
Or maybe you can learn how to actually play the game instead of dumbing everything down to your level. Take the few hours it takes to actually learn how to press buttons.
---
You're right. I missed the / lol.
---
Meatoberfest II
---
That assumes they hire just for expansions and then fire. That’s not the impression I got with LS3 -&gt; PoF -&gt; LS4 and how PoF was just a gigantic living world patch. Also how they mentioned the multi-team system and how they are (theoretically) always working on various releases with those teams in the background so each team just rolls from one thing to the next, whether it be “episode 2” or “the next expansion”
---
Does anyone know if it's possible to gift these to friends other than sending the friend the money and the friend buys them on their own?
---
Lol, still about $25 CAD. That conversion right now is just killer.
---
I mean... their class and balance "team" is just one guy named Andy, so of course nothing got done!
---
Thank you.
---
If we follow that logic, any media with a sword only a chosen hero can use feels like Legend of Zelda, every media about war feels like CoD, any media with dragons feels like Skyrim.
---
Too many asuras ? :) but ye i thought of asuras instantly, especially since underdark ones look like mine :)
---
I'm reading the Discworld series beginning to end, and it's will always and forever hold a place in my heart, but dead lord did he repeat himself a lot. Literally recycles jokes and not in a nod-and-a-wink way. 
---
Granny Weatherwax is Vimes with tea instead of booze and Tiffany Aching is Susan but grew up poor. 
---
I adore Terry Pratchett's writing, but a lot of his originality was used up very quickly and they do become quite samey when you read them back to back. 
---
They're like fruit cake  - even if they're stale they're rich enough that you don't notice.
---
It takes a long time for a bleed like that to reach critical mass though, from experience. Like, a very long time. 
---
True, but here is the thing. We have MMOs that have had no real content releases in years. And some that just release them once every couple of years. And even those are fine. And GW2 is very, *very* far away from them. The biggest worry we should have is that content slows down somewhat. But beyond that, were years away from anything else.
---
Skills would not cut it to make significant changes to the gameplay meta.
---
That being said, there are still missing core skills that need to be added to complete the core skill sets:
---
* Most sets are missing 1 healing and 2 elite skills.
---
* Engineers have 4 skill types with 5 skills each. 
---
 * The least used and unremarlable skil of each type should be converted into a fourth type, like traps or preparations, so they are consistent with other professions. 
---
 * They should also get a core mace weapon. No need to make brand new skills, since the weapon converted from kit to a new type could be the Tool Kit. Autoattack, Pry Bar and Magnet would be  moved to mace and adjusted for a weapon. Box of nails would be  moved to the new skill type, and throw wrench would remain as its toolbelt skill. 
---
* A 4th skill to revenant legends. These require changes in the engine to make them possible, since that's impossible right now. 
---
And we also need all utilities working underwater.
---
That's not quite how this conversation goes. 
---
See, Anet decided to invest in other projects that didn't get off the ground,. At no time did NcSoft say that Guild Wars 2 was the issue, or that Guild Wars 2 wasn't meeting expectations. Anet does not equal Guild Wars 2. They had other projects that were canceled and most of the devs were released from those projects. The game was doing well enough to fund other projects, but the projects themselves didn't materialize. 
---
More than that, the game started with around 300 employees and hired about a hundred more. Than let about 140 go. So we probably have about 40 less devs.
---
By contrast, SWTOR laid off a 3rd of it's staff much sooner after launch. TSW laid off half their staff much sooner after launch. Blizzard just had a big lay off too, are you going to say that WOW is in trouble.
---
It would be different if most of the people who were laid off were working on Guild Wars 2, but  that's not the case. In fact, we were told people working on other products have been returned to working on Guild Wars 2. We're not sure how many people were lost, but I don't believe it was a significant percentage of the dev team.
---
For example, we know some members of the raid team specifically are gone. We know that Josh is gone. And we know that Gaile is gone, but she's not a dev, she's community relations. 
---
And Anet is currently hiring. Not sure why you think that a layoff from a company is targeted at a specific product.
---
Have you watched it? It definitely feels closer than that.
---
Also, I want to say again - I am NOT saying that either GW2 or the series have copied *anything* off each other. I think they've just come to certain similar visuals due to wanting to draw on similar ideas.
---
It's much closer than GW2 is to something like Skyrim or Zelda.
---
I guess what I'm saying is that the Dark Crystal show kinda looks like how I would love an actual Guild Wars 2 TV series to look.
---
Ignore everyone. Seriously.
---
&gt; The game was doing well enough to fund other projects, but the projects themselves didn't materialize.
---
no, it wasn't, otherwise they wouldn't have deemed necessary to fire all those people and cancel all those projects without being finished.
---
We can imagine game is making some profit. Was it good enough to fund other things?, no, it wasn't.
---
I make sure to show up for Halloween. 
---
I'll play mad king says all day
---
Is it only me who felt said that on bottom of announcement , there is no mention of Dulfy :/.
---
I mean, yeah. This happens a lot in storytelling in all mediums. You don't even have to deflect plagiarism accusations. A lot of modern fantasy is heavily inspired by Tolkein and classic folklore, and Guild Wars is just a grab bag of fantasy tropes at its core.
---
No I'm making a business analysis, having been directly involved in the entertainment business where the business as a whole looks year on year, but the actual individual product doesn't work like that. And never did. 
---
Do you realize most books and games sell the most copies they ever sell in the first 90 days of their existence. Obviously that means over time the sales will go down, but the business plan always reflects that. I've written business and marketing plans which is how I know.  But if you want to see this as subjective as opposed to objective, that's your prerogative. The marketing plans for entertainment products are not based around individual properties.
---
... Why would Dulfy be on a GW2 blog?
---
Oh yes gimme patches. Profession logos. HoT logo. Anything.
---
If you buy the highest tier package you will receive 4000 gems which exact number of gems to buy all living world seasons.
---
That's true - I just mean that in this case, there are some specifics that feel really close. Much closer than, for example, I expect the upcoming Netflix series of "The Witcher" will be.
---
It feels a bit like how I would love an actual GW2 series to look.
---
It was good enough to fund the development. Obviously the products had to materialize to start earning income themselves. They didn't.
---
At the very least, neither of us could say for sure. You can't say it does or doesn't make enough to fund stuff, unless you're Anet's accountant.
---
Appreciated, though I really don't care about the upvotes/downvotes. Just thought it's funny enough to share but it turned out to be old news. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
That is a lot of words for something that can't be argued: it's very common and mainstream practice for investors to compare quarters to previous years counterparts, you can google it probably or ask an investor friend.
---
Reasons for different performances isn't what I was debating.
---
I legit wonder if popping my commander tag and posting "Friendly comm willing to help people get masteries" in the LFG would actually get people to show up. At this point all I'm doing is just outfitting characters and running metas so I may as well see if I can help others out.
---
“Many of our ArenaNet Partners create guides for new players. Check out AyinMaiden and TiffyMissWiffy‘s channels for tips, walk-throughs, and fun!”
---
She was our main to go spot each update ....
---
&gt;It was good enough to fund the development.
---
At some point, yes. That point isn't today though and it wasn't some months ago either when the layoffs happened and the projects got cancelled.
---
Welll mainstream practices are all well and good. Specific practices still apply to specific industries. I don't know anyone that compares year on year income for a single game and doesn't take expansion cycles into account. Not WoW. Not Final Fantasy. Every single game spikes during expansions and generally goes down. It's more important to everyone one of those companies to know that the third quarter is after an expansion than the third quarter of any given year for a single game.  For the company as whole that's another story, which is why the company tries to diversify and have more products and Anet tried.
---
The thing i would 10000% do if i were you is to  first unlock the basic mounts (springer, raptor, skimer etc) and then go for the hot maps. Improves the experience so much
---
Their pace hasn't changed since ARR though, it's like clockwork you can set your watch by their release schedule.
---
55 and 600/Smite were amazing for making money.
---
Raids are released because players requested them.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/raids-in-guild-wars-2/
---
We're arguing in a vacuum. Neither of us have enough information to really intelligently discuss this. It's all just guesses and that's not really going to get us anywhere.
---
Yeah, they need to hire more QA testers cause right now they just have one guy named [Andy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-mcleod-7b91516) testing everything.
---
Have you tried 600ing with a hero running Smite?
---
Kinda hurts
---
If you're new it's a great game... problems don't really start or are passable until you are waaaaay further in the game. Like others mentioned, take your time leveling and exploring because the game is in an odd place atm.
---
Fuckin gottem
---
I could never get into FFXIV like I could with FFXI or SWG. 
---
Not sure why
---
If the argument is expansions spike earnings and we have a confirmed long period of time without any expansion at all I think this is a pretty self defeating discussion to begin with.
---
That was really cool to watch. Nice one!
---
This is probably because ANet artists try to make plants and animals look otherworldly and alien, yet familiar. 
---
And that happens a lot with the settings of Thra.
---
Srsly ,F this mobile market .... mobile “games” should not  even called game, more like, lazy ppl bait.
---
It's bugged just fixe it
---
Im not gonna lie and say im quitting but definitely less motivated to play outside of new releases.
---
Always the possibility the content will speak for itself and change my mind but im no longer holding my breath
---
Awww thank you it means a lot :))
---
It is you....introducing potential massive power spikes to one class at a time sounds like an incredible way to get competitive PVP players out of the game :(
---
What is the icon in your flair of?
---
Shit,  now they'll only have 299 employees turning out nothing
---
I was way well on my way to level up to a full blown whale. And my reasoning felt pretty alright
---
“Man I get neat stuff AND I support the game/devs/growth? Heck of a deal”
---
Then my personal reality check happened with the announcement and I don’t feel compelled anymore. It’s like the part where I was happy to support this got sucked away. Also figures, I need to learn to keep away from their RNG items.
---
Not cuz of the mounts but one big reason why i dont open the wardrob unlocks yet. First i wanna get all the cheap/karma/hot and pof cutrency things. And then finaly i will open every wardrob and the knife bounds i have.
---
Wait is this real?
---
In fact, the answer may be based on the opinion of the player. I've never liked GW2's story but others have.
---
I respect that. The game is not gonna be the same without arc build templates :( Your work is amazing.
---
TL;DR: Read the last paragraph.
---
Recently people have been getting a bit restless as Anet hasn't really done much recently with parts of the game that aren't LS episodes or festivals, such as PvP, fractals, raids, and WvW. Even some people who enjoyed the LS episodes (myself included) were a little concerned after the layoffs earlier this year (Anet were apparently working on at least one side project that flopped, and NCSoft "restructured" the company as a result, laying off people and ostensibly keeping a tighter leash on GW2 and Anet), especially with no clear long term vision for the game and little communication from the devs, plus even I was getting a little tired of just getting a few hours of content with little replay value every few months with little in between (I miss side stories...).
---
Then a month or so ago, they announced a big event. They rented out a large hall and were hyping it up as a huge announcement. So a lot of people started seeing it as a make it or break it moment and started speculating what the announcement would entail. Everyone was expecting it would include  the reveal for LS5, but since that would normally warrant just a blog post or stream, people assumed there was more to it, like announcements of anything substantial for the non-LS modes, or at least that they would reveal LS5's "expansion-like features" that devs hinted would start to be included towards the end of LS4 and further.
---
So...it didn't exactly end up as a "make it" moment for Anet. The event didn't tell us much more than we were already expecting as the minimum, just the announcement of LS5, now called a "saga," with no information on what the difference is between a saga and season (though they implied there was a notable reason for the name change but gave no indication of what it was). 
---
They gave a little info on the first 2.5 episodes (a prologue coming out in a few weeks and two episodes that share a map), including some info on strike missions, 10 man boss fights designed to be an on-ramp to raids, or at the very least an easier raid mode. Unfortunately they didn't say anything about whether there will be new raids or if these will be the only raidlike content being released from now on. 
---
The same sort of ambiguity pervaded throughout the rest of the announcement, especially the little mentions to other game modes, like another promise that more info on WvW alliances will be coming "in the coming months," which I understand WvW players have been told a lot ever since alliances were hinted at a while ago. 
---
PvP got 2v2 queues to finally matchmake for the new map, as well as a new armor set, which I understand many PvPers probably don't really care much about. 
---
They then finished the show off by spending the last third of their time advertising GW2 Funko Pops and other merchandise.
---
So basically, Anet hyped up this big announcement to announce exactly what was expected as the bare minimum and which could be and usually was in the past made as a blog post or normal stream, were ambiguous about pretty much everything and gave no idea as to any plan past the few announced LS episodes, had little if anything substantial for other modes, and then wasted 15 minutes advertising merchandise. If it was just a blog post or stream, people probably wouldn't be this riled up, just disappointed, but since Anet hyped up the announcement, the stakes were much higher, and consequently, so was the letdown.
---
Like in fractal. Learning while playing. Not everyone has time to waste to master a game just to play the first time
---
Different life in real world. A game like gw2 is intended to be relaxing not a work. This is why is working, why there is no vertical progression, why stats are maxed in legendary too.
---
This is whyost people do not raid
---
People call this fashion wars but actually is more or less a fantasy exploration simulator , an expanding open world.
---
Yep they are certainly exceptions but when you look at the number of games that come out and the number of games that that happens to, you begin to realize just how rare it is.
---
I'm hoping that merchandising bullshit was pushed by NCSoft. Cause it was so dumb. But it wouldn't surprise me either way.
---
Honestly, while Adnormeda's writing wasn't good, it was FAR from being the game's only or main problem.
---
It does more than you would think.
---
Friend needed to run some metas for a legendary or something, and no one was on the map. Nothing was happening. Put his tag on for the next go around, and almost instantly got like 20 people in his squad.
---
There are people looking at LFG just for something to do. I won't be surprised if you find a decent mix of new and veteran players joining up, just to smack some stuff around if nothing else.
---
This looks good, I'm really excited about charr rock songs:-D
---
If they unhooked rifle from being limited to Deadeye, I could see them setting the stealth skill to a base malice level for non-Deadeyes- like, the damage values would always be set to 3 stacks of malice or something. 
---
And I hope that, at some point, they can unhook the weapons from their elite specs. With it being more recent code than, say, the whole weapon-backpack-dye thing, it's hopefully less spaghetti-crazy. (at least... I assume the elite spec code isn't too old, considering they didn't show up until HoT...)
---
y r u shrek

Oh come on the ukulele song Steven wrote for the gems is wonderful and for the LGBT part I did not even get till I read on internet about it . Lol it is not a Ghibli studio cartoon but it is much better than most stuff out there. You should give it another chance and skip filler episodes (many) . Adventure time is so full of filler episodes till late seasons that u do not even realize its plot
---
 More or less it is the same here.
---
Btw no trying to change your mind. Each one has different tastes for this kind of thing .
---
You dont need to master a class to raid you just need to be anywhere competent. I dont know where you got the idea that you need a high lvl of skill to do raids in this game but its false. Now if you are so bad that you just cant or just choose not to, thats fine but youre talking about two different things.
---
To be fair, new skills are halfway there to a new elite.
---
But no, I wouldn't be against new skills. I just don't see it happening outside of a rework like we saw with thief.
---
What do you mean by management?
---
Rainbow Six Siege seems to be another. That game seems to just keep growing.
---
Cause it's hella grindy, designed for solo play, and apparently doesn't get good until the expansions?
---
Undah de sea.
---
Watch out, we have a badass over here. Lol dude.
---
I had no problem with any of the vanilla ones and even go back to a few of them from time to time, then a handful of crybabies came out of the woodwork to bitch how easy they all were so now they go out of their way to make them as challenging as they possibly can so now only a handful of people even bother trying to figure them out and the rest just have mesmers portal them up for the achievement then never go back to it. Then the devs decided that since nobody wanted to do the jumping puzzles anymore they would just stop making them instead of going back to the relatively simple little puzzles like they had at launch that people actually enjoy doing.
---
I remember when i first discovered Weyandt's Revenge and ran it several times back to back because it was so fun to do, that one is a great example of how jumping puzzles should be imo. Goemm's Lab and Dark Reverie were also really fun to do and Urmaug's Secret was super satisfying when you finally figured out how to get up there after poking into that cave several times and thinking "there has to be something in here".
---
Master the fight not the profession . U can know you profession and not the raid
---
They're behind Aion, too?

I have 19 wardrobe unlocks stashed. I have all dyes under 5g unlocked (plus some pricier ones from drops) and 71% of armor skins. Currently working on finishing buying all T2 cultural armors and dungeon armors before using guaranteed. Have all minis under 1.5g and same with weapons. Anything i unlock is with a 193g average. Woohoo. Waiting till 250
---
Lol, ok. Following a zerg or a small group with simple goals is really complex. a few people handle strategy while everyone else just runs along like zombies.
---
Anyway I can't understand why u do not want a fractal like system with same drops and currency and all but different tiers
---
Except there is tons of data on why "Big box" releases are not actually that good for a software based product to utilize:
---
1. Many changes at once leading to code/assets that are harder to maintain, troubleshoot, and tend to be more buggy (many changes released at once instead of iteratively).
---
2. Smaller, more frequent ("frequent" being relative to the product's expansion cadence) updates/releases lead to more stability and improved feedback loops from customers to developers. ANet has made some changes a lot fast than their competitors have based on customer feedback. Note: this doesn't mean they will always act on feedback, just that they can get it faster.
---
3. Troubleshooting is easier as there are less changes to dig through and figure out which one caused the issue. This also allows for the devs to "Roll forward" with fixes rather than "Roll back, fix, deploy". Downtime/outages are less catastrophic and easier to manage.
---
More practical and descriptive reason why bi-annual, annual, and longer release cadences are not necessarily the best: [https://imgur.com/a/mB7LlIZ](https://imgur.com/a/mB7LlIZ)

Show me your logs that prove otherwise
---
lot of story content if you are into that its quite worth it I would say although wiki and youtube are great alternatives too
---
Shining Blade, i think.
---
&gt; we're just gonna have to quit game for real
---
unironically
---
That's a great idea. Thanks!
---
Because it would take away from development of normal raids, they are already easy enough people just need to learn how to play the game. The biggest problem is that thr cadence is 9+ months
---
My girlfriend and I have 3000+ combined hours in GW2 since launch, and we’ve loved every second of it. The game is fantastic and Anet is a great developer. It’s older so don’t expect the content release schedule it had at launch (which people seem to be most upset about).
---
Yeah the subreddit community went down in flames, but the in-game community is still one of the best in the gaming industry and you’ll have so much fun and help. Have a blast!
---
I tried but couldn't get the link to work.
---
From GW1 Beyond... War in Kryta.
---
Yes, the base game is sort of aids.
---
you're gonna demand me take the door while defending a high-strung brainlet frothing at the mouth XD
---
Also curious.
---
Since you're a new player, there's so much content for you to get through and it'll keep you busy and having fun for a long time. The current negativity is from those of us who've already gone through the majority of what the game offers and is about what is/isn't being added on top of all that content. There's nothing bad happening with what's in the game already.
---
If you like it stay, be calm, take what is offered. If you don't like it, fucking leave and stop shitposting. The end.
---
You should well know by now that Anet hates vet players and wish for GW2 to be filled by new/casual players.
---
what hes trying to say is that these numbers are just raw revenue, not earnings/profits.  
---
revenue is the money you get from selling your stuff.  
---
earnings (or net income/profits) are revenue - the cost of making/running that product, so the actually money you made.
---
The 50 and 100 gold options in the bottom right both look better than the 200 gold option.
---
&gt; But it should be possible
---
That's true for a lot of things &gt;.&lt; Most close to mind being making hair and hats work together...
---
Coincidentally, this is exactly what happened with the original Guild Wars. It got more popular year over year until they jumped to making GW2.
---
huh?  
---
according to the english wiki (earnings *are* profits.)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings]
---
World of Warcrafts biggest boom was 3 expansions deep.... GW2 has never lived up to the  expectations of the mass of MMO players unfortunately :(.
---
It doesn't show what discovered recipes a character is missing.
---
Only recipes known by the account, locked account recipes, and recipes discovered by each character.
---
Funny how people all of a sudden believe Jessica Price.
---
It was only a year or so ago she was a lying bitch,  etc.
---
My friend just got HoT and PoF when they were on sale. She's run through S2 while someone else was instance owner so she could see how she liked the living stories. 
---
She'd like to get the S2, S3, and S4 while they are on sale but S3 isn't showing up at all in her gem store
---
If it matters, she joined as a free account.
---
Poe is great and all. But it's the worst fucking grindfest ever. Repeating the same fuckin maps over and over.
---
OK,  so what are ANet doing then?
---
Yeah, it is. But, compared to what its regular price is it was a good deal.
---
&gt; If you're going to make a statement like that, be ready to back up your claims, or don't make them.
---
Well, according to GW2 Efficiency, which would *tend* to skew in favor of hardcore players like raiders, only 1% of players have Legendary armor, only 10% have more than a handful of Legendary Insights, only 1% have any Legendary Divinations. 
---
This is incomplete evidence, perhaps, but it is strong circumstantial evidence to indicate that it is *likely* that less than 10% of GW2's players raid regularly, if at all. If I were going to put money on it, I would wager that less than 5% of the overall population raids on a weekly basis or more.
---
&gt;While at it, have you ever heard of the phrase: don't put all your eggs in one basket?
---
Sure, but it's also not wise to devote significant resources to a tiny pool of players. You can't please everyone, and raiders already whine all the time that they don't get *enough* attention as it is. Better to just cut them loose than to throw good money after bad. 
---
&gt;Guess what happens when the hardcore casuals and the hardcore players, who support the game thoroughly leave. 
---
Again, the raiding population is an insignificant portion of the community. They can all leave and nobody would notice. They aren't the only ones who "stick it out," the vast majority of this game's population have stuck around the entire time, because they actually *enjoy* GW2's core gameplay loops. In fact, it's the raider types who are more likely to come and go, as many of them, including in this thread, reported that *they* left until the raids were added, and *they* tend to wander off once they'd gotten what they can out of the latest raids and are waiting for new ones. Raiders are not "more stable" players than "filthy casuals."
---
&gt;So, if you, and others like you, could use your big brain enough, you'd figure out that for an MMORPG to survive, it needs to have a balance of BOTH - not one or the other.
---
Only if raiders mattered to GW2, which they do not.
---
&gt; It's rare for something to have a mellow launch and then steadily rise from there due to word of mouth.
---
Clearly you've never met my blood pressure.
---
Ok, can someone explain to me why everyone wants new specialications? Or rather, Super Many new specs? I feel that’s what everyones talking about lately..
---
Please don’t bite my head of.
---
Are the discovery ones even in the API??
---
Fan-site
---
Okay I've seen these ncsoft earning reports many times throughout the years and something that's always bothered me is why the *fuck* does this Lineage game make so much cash? Like, naturally I would assume that Lineage II would be the more popularly played one since it's newer. Is it more or less similar to how OSRS overtook RS3 in popularity? No, even that is a terrible comparison to make because OSRS isn't the one littered with microtransactions.
---
I've never played those games before so I have no idea what's going on. I'm assuming it's just some extremely popular MMO in asia that has a shitload of p2w aspects on it.
---
&gt;Devs talked instead about how time consuming raiding is and how hard it is to find enough friends to do raids.
---
Just to be clear to those that might not play raids regularly this isn't even mostly a problem of just finding 10 people anymore, it's that the vast majority of raiders are no longer playing and the raid community is nearly as dead as it gets.
---
The one you're thinking of is Ursan Blessing. Not really used anymore these days IIRC, it got nerfed at some point. A number of the *other* PvE-only skills definitely still see a lot of use, though.
---
I think its important to keep that in mind when offering advice to players especially new ones, that they have a accurate picture of whats expected in group scenarios. Raids are expected to maintain 100% boon uptime, so they are very relevant to expected numbers.
---
It's interesting seeing everything put into perspective like this. If there's one thing I take away from it all it's that if NCSoft didn't axe GW2 during the post-HoT slump they probably aren't going to now, so unless S5 is a total flop we can probably expect to see ongoing development for may years to come.
---
They could just launch the new content on steam and get a much better response, without disappointment, and hype would follow....
---
I didn't mean it as a good way to earn money. Just a way to avoid having to keep on hiring and firing people.
---
Was Ritualist not added? Pretty sure I saw it on there earlier today...
---
That's your racist mind, not mine. Also the name 'lil saltine' is offensive against my people. Consider yourself reported.
---
It really wouldn't be.
---
You can't hire coders, artists, writers, and musicians with passion, after all.
---
A sub model provides steady income, and more importantly study income that comes directly from how engaged people are in the game - as opposed to cash shop purchases, which don't really need a generally happy or consistent player base to make a profit.

Not to deny anything, but have anyone seen any death threats proof on their own eyes? I've seem some tweets from Rubi and some other devs who tweet about receiving a lot of toxic hate and death threats, but to be honest I've been browsing twitter, reddit and gw2 forums past days and hadn't seen a single comment nor post that would be that toxic as described in their tweets or directed at specific anet employees.
---
&gt;layoffs didn't affect
---
Is never true, ever. Especially in the game development world.
---
How you gonna tell me that reducing workforce doesn't have an impact on output.
---
Yup. I wish we could get a little 5-10 minute puzzle every other map or so. Nothing crazy, just some nice fun side activity for exploring.
---
GW2 Without the expansions was less interesting then FFXIV
---
But GW2 with expansions feels more fluid and fun (thank god for the mounts!), Even though the trinity (heal/tank/dps) and godlike music does make FFXIV quite interesting. I still find GW2 combat system superior
---
No lag on my PC as well.
---
Recommend going through the expansion story for both POF and HOT (HOT first of course, in your hero panel, under story journal, you'll see the order of content releases so play them in that order starting with HOT). You'll also want to experience living story season 3 and 4, both of which cost real money except for whichever episodes you do have unlocked on your account (you can also convert ingame gold into gems, but you'll want a lot of gold for both mounts so don't go converting it all). I think there's a sale going on right now too, I might be mistaken. 
---
To get back into the groove of the game without being overwhelmed, take the time to situate your character. Check out the hero panel and all the tabs, check out which achievements you may have been tracking, check out what gear you have. Head into a map, any map, and just start killing things and getting used to the feel of the game again. This way you don't have to start over AGAIN, as the leveling experience for brand new players is still disappointing imo. 
---
Now, you don't HAVE to buy the other living world seasons if you don't want as you can just play the new episodes as they come out without really caring (can always read episode summaries from the official wiki), but imo season 3 and 4 are worth it. Season 2 not so much.
---
I wouldnt mind the show if it was actually LGBTQ and had nice visuals, but the anination is a mess and 90% of the show is queer baiting, toxic relationships, and accidental racism
---
It goes from  Raiment of the Lich to Rox's Pathfinder outfit.
---
No Ritualist Outfit.
---
this is actually really steady. Nice
---
Also, caring too much and getting angry over a video game is just as bad. 
---
I've seen a lot of that here lately too.
---
I still don't understand this open workd strike raid thing, but it's 10 man. 
---
How can it be both?
---
I will be honest; I don't think Anet can handle the balance if there are new classes while they are already struggling to balance the existing ones.
---
I will be more honest; I don't think they have enough creativity to create new elite specs so going straight forward to LS 5 instead of a new expansion is a way to delay things that they are lack of.
---
The problem with Anet in my sight is that they have announced the LS was gonna have "expansion level" features yet they didn't announce anything expansion level valuable which is obviously new elite specs because there were new ones with HoT and PoF.
---
The problem with people in my sight tho, like I don't know how to say this but I think they are (including me before the recent announcement) expecting too much from the developers, which is not wrong. They of course want something new and exciting like new ways to play the game or make it more competitive or something like that but I'm actually starting to think that the studio is basically not capable of it anymore. As far as I remember they even said that they are struggling creating new masteries / or had hard times imagining new masteries for PoF. Like how can you expect them to create a full set of new elite specs while they are already struggling with a such thing like that right?
---
Yea so long story short the main thing people are upset about including me is that they have announced something expansion level big coming up which means new elite specs at first when you think about it but they couldn't deliver any single expansion level shit.
---
he is a major streamer for gw2 who got his start on gw2, and while playing wow people come into the chat and bash gw2 and he constantly defends it. we have every right to be frustrated, but its a shame to see places like massively op and other gamign sites take the perspective of reddit over the perspective of someone who has played soooo much more than most of us have.
---
 he literally made his streamer living off of gw2 and for a while ive felt like i know the game and what there is to be happy about BETTER than he did. but i dont really think it was right of me to feel that way. sure we can remain frustrated about the main things we are frustrated about, but at the end of the day, im glad this is just a subreddit because man if the general anger spikes were actually able to have a direct affect on how many people logged in daily, or the metacritic score, then i mean, this game actually would be dead before we even had a chance to calm down.
---
im not saying any of the major criticisms that have been circulating, or that i have been circulating myself are wrong, its the way ive been projecting my own expectations and disappointments, and conflating disappointments with things that i deserved to have by this point in the form of information and such. there are alot of things i have gotten too angry about this weekend. i will continue waiting for them to talk more about it, because sure, maybe they should have been ready now, maybe they should have had more information now, but like, ill be damned if i have ever witnessed a single time in which this subreddit of all places actually did anything that convinced Anet to come out and speak about things.
---
what they speak about, what mike o brien speaks about, time and time again is a decision made solely by the company, and i cant help but feel like i am just wasting energy being mad that their words dont meet my expectation and self-designed timelines. part of me feels that i am saying that from a defeatist angle, but the more i watch the stream (other than the merch shill at the end), the less desperate it felt to me. i love this game, and i went into the stream with such a cynical and negative view. and i have to ask myself if i would be in a better mood nearly every day if i didnt log into this subreddit and sort by controversial, sometimes not even needing to do that to see all the negativity, justified or not.
---
The problem with cdkeys and instagaming is that both of those sites are not authorized dealers, but key resellers. You might get a real key. You might get a key bought with a stolen credit card.
---
If you get the latter, the company will close/ban your account and you'll have to start over. Not worth the risk to me.
---
That's also true.
---
S1 is free for everyone. 
---
You talk to that NPC and she recaps it for you. 
---
/s
---
NPC's have often had weapon and profession combo's unnavailable to players.
---
Just like some have outright professions we don't get.
---
To add to this: Anet made it difficult if not downright impossible for small guilds to acquire storage after the release of HoT . The same can be said for guild halls.  If they do give us housing, it'll be locked behind expansions and so much other grinding that it won't be worth the headache.
---
Earnings is not an accounting term.  What you are seeing here is revenue.  Revenue - cost = profit
---
both are true, but weirdly enough, i have not seen nearly as many things as i would have expected at this point from Anet if they really do feel like they are in damage control mode.
---
Afk wintrader.
---
Even before that, in GW1, Keiran Thackeray switched from main ranger to main paragon, while players are limited to only change secondary professions.
---
It could be neat if we had some sort of 'rebirth' token to change profession and race of our characters without losing map completion, level hero points, etc. But there's no such option for playable characters at this point .
---
Everyone wants to be angry all the time at something.

Then only a couple of white knights and fan boys would remain probably.

Why argue this is you have to google it? These are revenues. Profit = revenues - expenses.
---
Often a dev will have a few full-time QA folk and a lot of underpaid part-time QA temps.
---
If you **spend** $10 to **earn** $10, is that still profit?
---
It is a clear sign that people need to step away from the game for a bit when they get far too emotionally tied up in it.
---
They know cosmetics will be a future purchase.  Really this game,should be on steam of they want hordes of players....no sub? This game would thrive on steam
---
Depends on the game. I don't play mobile MMOs.
---
If I was trying to create a product, I would research my market properly, see what people like, see what they don't . If a potential customer said that some changes would make them more interested in my product, I would seriously consider the impact of the changes. Yes, the desires of old players may be different, but regardless they matter. They matter, because they may highlight somethings that are otherwise overlooked, things that could cause players to leave earlier than they need to, issues that current players may not be bothered by. Perhaps you don't take to heart the advice of someone who has not played the game mode for 4 years, as much as a current player, but regardless, it matters. Furthermore GW2 is a game that is inherently set up (Combat system/ Split balance between game modes) with the ability to cater to both these herds of players if it came down to a drastic difference (Disregarding current execution)
---
Just because of the volatile atmosphere of the sub currently, I truly hope you weren't venting out by attempting to split the player base.  While it may seem like a way to rally the masses, to perhaps start a movement of sorts, it usually just fizzles out, and the division acts as a wall for any real changes.
---
excluding the people that were truly only ever hyped about the *concept* of wvw and never actually got into the mode as ANet eventually presented it at launch, in my experience the expectations and hopes for the mode haven't changed all that much. so the only distinction between these groups is that one got tired of waiting.
---
 Of worth that much. I’d rather take a screenshot.
---
lmao, you get really upset when someone reminds you of the truth, huh?
---
You must be upset that every time someone calls you out on it, your posts start to get buried.
---
The problem is maps are stuck in time. Mordremoth is still alive.
---
Do it. Worth the risk!
---
They can also start using old masteries like with dragonfall
---
&gt;still no new race
---
Pretty sure they said a good time ago that they wouldnt be adding more races.
---
Judging by the backlash, it's likely making more people quit than come back to the game. It certainly made me quit for good.
---
I'm not denying it's not as good as before, but it was incredibly overtuned for a LONG time which isn't good for the game.  
---
To say "on instanced content it's completely useless" is wrong though.  ERP winners Lucky Noobs utilized double Chrono on many of the bosses with no FB or Ren.  Snowify utilized Chrono + Ren + FB.  Most others utilized Chrono + Ren + FB as well.  To say FB/FB/Ren is superior and that Chrono is now trash doesn't factor in what the best of the best are using.    
---
My post doesn't address WvW/PvP chrono, but only PvE chrono, due to the fact that I do agree, especially in WvW, it's just a gutted spec at this point in those modes because of the Illusionary Persona change (which also imo was bad for the class as a whole).  My point is just that it's still a great class in PvE, just feels shitty
---
Elite specs were the right direction from core GW2 to HoT, but the slow refining of skills and talents is the biggest disappointment to be honest. Still to this day, Guardian/Dragonhunter's longbow is so terrible for PvE. PoF elite specs were  even more needing of fleshing out. For example, Ranger/Soulbeast's dagger auto attack is extremely counter-intuitive design for rotation purposes. Another example of overall lacking development, many elite skills or the 10th skill slot have too long of a cool-down or straight up weak effects to be called 'elite'; this includes both core specs and some elite specs. This just covers development of PvE balance which is a very small yet important section of the game.
---
I made this comment to hopefully cover some of your disappointment.
---
&gt; new players don't care about story continuity
---
Maybe, maybe not, but it'd certainly help if there *was* story continuity without spending an extra $15 or whatever it is.
---
Me too, I enjoyed exploring the world of Andromeda and seeing more of my favorite game universe. I didn't connect with the party members as much as I did in the original, that was what put a damper on it for me but most of it I enjoyed universe-wise.
---
WvW is probably already past the point of no return with the non announcement.  Players and guilds were leaving before the announcement and it straight up led to many more leaving immediately after it.
---
Another recent example: Follower Kaidena, the NPC that starts off the meta to enter Augury Rock, wears T3 Sylvari heavy armor, while using Mirage axe skills.
---
If you have been playing the game (Gw2) for seven years, then you should know this; updates to the current game mechanics  are far, few between, and too tiny to amount to actual game play changes. 
---
Look at the 'normalization' for utility consumption items. They barely touched any of the problems of the entire system and literally just nerfed the odd ones that were too powerful or meta: these were toxic utilities, and  magnanimous utilities.
---
Look at the 'big update' to underwater combat. They added a few utility skills, but for most professions half of the utilities and elite skills are still locked. Look at how they broke or nerfed mesmer spear skills 2 and 5.
---
The direction of the game has been terrible for a while, but it keeps getting worse somehow. It's to be expected with their chaotic management and little communication combined with terrible  development. Overall, nothing surprising here.
---
&gt; Monthly sub is one of the fairest monetization schemes, imo.
---
I too agree, but what about a monthly fee *and* a cash shop? Because that has become the norm, even for XIV.
---
Not making Ascended gear stat switchable was a huge mistake IMO. One of the best parts of GW1 was being able to switch builds and try out new stuff on the fly. Yes build templates made it a bit easier but the real reason was because your build was mostly determined by attribute points instead of gear.
---
New skills = new traits to buff them. Some classes have useless traits (Guardian's Glacial Heart, for instance), some classes have all the traits in their traitline useful (Necromancer's Blood Magic). 
---
Unless they are gonna add another traitline to buff new skills, but that's just one step from making an elite spec. 
---
I'm rather voting for adding missing skills to classes cathegory; like Mesmer doesn't have a healing spell in Glamour, Guardian doesn't have an elite for Spirit Weapons, Necromancer doesn't have an elite Well, Mesmer doesn't have an elite Clone/Phantasm skill, no elite trap for Ranger, etc. etc.
---
By the time I quit you could take 7 wee totally customisable helpers with you.
---
To be honest, they were better than most the players.
---
&gt;	I'd be angry too if the game wasn't meeting my needs...but it is. This game fits my needs pretty well. Not perfectly but pretty well.
---
Filthy casual
---
No it doesnt... on golem, that's pretty low though
---
what other forms of damage control have you seen? i mean im sure most partners dont want to sever that relationship they have with anet as it is, all things considered, unless they really do decide to go full anto-gw2 mode, but like, realistically, they are busy people, why would they want to, right?
---
Upvoted for truth. lol
---
Cruel. You are a cruel person.
---
... it's so damn cool though gimme
---
I don't see it to be honest, except for gelflings looking rather asura-like.
---
&gt; But actually look at those numbers. Any two quarters after an expansion makes more money than that expansion did
---
Well you could argue that driven by the increase in interest after an expansion.
---
Having said that I do think once you analyse the expansion numbers against the price and extrapolate how many people must have bought the expansions its not great, especially given the size of the team working on GW2.
---
Right now is a VERY good time to begin playing this amazing game
---
So did Diablo 2 and that kind of genre in general, really. I don't want to say its a case of Nostalgia, but standards for video games have risen *dramatically* over the last decade. Games that set the standard for fun/crazy/innovative tend to look downright mediocre if played with fresh eyes these days.
---
It's a good thing because it means the medium is moving forward despite problems of its own) but it has led to a really strange disconnect between old gen and new gen design. I think its why you see a lot of conflict between those groups.
---
You were supposed to be hurt by that comment

No, he's an interested person who is confused by the absolute lack of information in your post. wtf am I suppose to think by seeing "15333 earned in 2018Q2". It doesnt mean anything without units.

Nothing hurts me on reddit. If it did I'd have been dead years ago.

It's not 90% of the sub, though.  Just like with any social platform only a small percentage of the people subscribed to the sub ever actively reply to it let alone create threads.  Sure there can be a lot of posting and commenting, but it's mostly done by the same general stable population of people, while the majority of those subscribed to the sub will simply read and never post (1/9/90 or 1/10/80 rule which in itself has a margin for error but generally remains true.  1% of a total social platform's population creates posts, 9-10% comment, and the other 89-90% only ever lurk or post extremely occasionally).

Interestingly the 1% rule also applies to MMOs as a whole as generally only 10-15% of the total population of a game will ever post to a subreddit of that game or its official forums.... combined.  The fact is that the sub and the forums only represent a handful of the game's total number of players, the majority of which prefer to remain silent and simply play the game.

Try looking into GW2Hook for post processing filters, that might be what you're seeing in other people's videos.

Interrupt heroes in particular were (and are) ridiculous due to having computer-level reflexes and a willingness to abuse them.
