-actual parking is finished, you can only park there two hours each day. You can add 1 daily hour for 5 bucks to a cap of 22. It has a pseudo car wash which is the justification for the price tag.

I wish they’d add an expansion with a new race and „starter“ zones. Takes us back to the leveling experience
---
What chest/legs are those in the preview?
---
Yeah, playing like shit is bad too, I thought we had taken that as a given. So what ? It's fine to bring a shit build as long as you stack so it doesn't look like you're leeching ?
---
&gt; **A mix of diviner's** and berserkers

Exactly.
---
The animation was bad even when it was new. For comparison, it released a full decade after Toy Story.
---
That's whole a lotta' norn.
---
Wasn't the original launcher (red) displaying CAITHE, not LOGAN?
---
Runs exactly like the PS3 version of the game, especially considering my phone can project it large on a wall (usually project about 30-36 inches, but have projected a clear image even up to 50 inches) and I can play with a Playstation 4 controller connected to it via bluetooth.  The point is that there is literally nothing a handheld gaming device shy of the Switch or 3DS can do that a modern top tier smart phone can't, and a lot that those handhelds can't do that a smart phone can.  Just because most developers don't take advantage of how powerful and capable smart phones actually are doesn't mean that a smart phone isn't a capable or even better handheld gaming device than any dedicated handheld gaming device like the PSVita, as an example.
---
To be honest, because my phone natively supports one through moto-mods that's the one I use (see image in prior post), but when projecting I just use a PS4 controller connected via bluetooth.  I assume an XBox controller would work as well.  If you're looking for an attachment based one specifically I can't really make any suggestions one way or another.
---
I literally can’t tell if this is sarcasm
---
Yeah I've went back and played with some of my friends when I got them into the game. It brought back great memories and a lot of things I have simply overlooked in the last 7 yrs. I'm almost jealous I can't have that brand new feel again. Good Luck and hope she continues to love the game.
---
is this person saying 17 bank tabs are enough? smh
---
I like this :3
---
Its things like the launcher/char select screen that really make me wonder *why* they haven't changed yet. Sure, we're still on prologue but they should be easy to change. Is this yet another decision from Anet management saying no, don't do it. Such a easy thing to do and its not done yet, it really boggles my mind whats going on within Anet.
---
necro/reaper is my vote and has worked well for me.
---
Ascended gear in WvW purchased with skirmish tickets is mostly a gateway to legendary armor. If you're not striving for that, then it's not worth it. Easier and almost as cheap to craft it.
---
You will get ascended chests periodically in rank-up chests and drops (and I've heard from reward tracks, but I don't think I've ever gotten one in my 7,500+ ranks).
---

---
Thank you for the detailed response, it makes a lot of sense.
---
Maguuma thief ganker backstabbing from stealth. Hard to believe!
---
Necromancer with the Reaper spec is easily one of the easiest solo specs.
---
Hold up, what are these potential leaks from the livestream and the watch giveaway? Can you elaborate?
---
I also recommend Ranger. I find my power soulbeast is... A beast. Very self-sufficient and you get a little friend! Helps with drawing aggro.
---
that only tells you her pronouns
---
you heard it ppl, don't downvote, you'll only give them what they want!
---
All i can think of now is a time traveling hoping to see a T-Rex like in Jurassic Park, but finds a big chungus Rex instead.
---
Most folks will recommend Necro for solo play, especially for newer players, and it’s a good choice. However, I would argue for the Guardian. A smaller health pool and more reliant on active defenses, but once you level it up and get the hang of the basic combat mechanics, it’s a strong choice. You have access to so many different skills to handle various situations, and strong elite specs (Firebrand and Dragonhunter) once you get to the later game. 2 years into the game I’d much rather solo on my Firebrand than on either of the Necro specs.
---
Necro 100%. Reaper dishes out the damage with berserker gear and scourge is great with conditions. Scourge is my go to trivializing content spec with blood and curses because you usually out heal and sustain most damage.
---
I miss you.
---
Whoops! :p Glad you liked it!
---
Thanks alot! I tried not to make it too colorful
---
&gt; I think the main reason why people even talk about GW3 is because there's a 2 in GW2's name. 
---
Instantly you prove you have no idea what you're talking about. Almost every sentence you say there is wrong.
---
Want what?
---
I'm just saying for a fact that we need a GW3 because the mechanics of GW2 are flawed in such a way that requires a total revamp to fix.
---
Thought experiment: Would GW2 be healthier if stats did not exist at all?
---
Plus even Blade &amp; Soul is not only going to get a sequel, but it's going to update THE ENTIRE ENGINE from UR3 to 4.
---
HoT adding raids and healers into a game where the point was "no trinity" and that every class was self-sufficient was bad.
---
Who cares?
---
It's not like you can pull out a dna kit and figure it out for sure
---
An MMO can't release a sequel without good reason, but yeah there's probably something to said about naming conventions and the implications that come with putting a number in the title.
---
Interestingly, people have been talking about a WoW2 lately - and indeed for good reason. After 8 versions of the game (7 expansions) the characters are talking about ending the faction war, you know the whole premise of the game; they're trying to move forward and create peace, and hopefully not just temporarily. Plus its been so very long, and so very much has happened and changed all over the game.
---
I love you too
---
Not just that, the abundance of healing and the fact you can move while casting on most skills is also an issue.
---
Basically this. Pretty sure every other source is dead or dying.
---
Man the virgin raiders strike again!!!
---
Good thing us open world chads don't care!
---
No one "released" any rumors about GW3. Its player base speculating about GW3. Anet has no control on it. They had planned for a new project that got canned, which may or may not be GW3. We don't know. Now stop creating rumors yourself.
---
Oh I think they were definitely chonky like [depicted here](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/k4EKkx)
---
People are desperate for a new mmo just nobody has the ability to do it.
---
Honestly would rather have braham chilling shirtless, laying sprawled on a mountaintop with luxurious and voluminous hair cascading down his thicc neck
---
No homo
---
It looks fine for a fencing pic, turned-out legs and feet was considered elegant.
---
Other project**s**. Plural. We know there were at least two, though we don't know what they were entirely. What we know is basically:
---
1. According to Kotaku, one was in the Guild Wars IP. Kotaku *blatantly and baselessly* presumes that meant GW3, despite also stating that a GW3 project was never greenlit.
---
2. [An artist](https://www.artstation.com/guyfugly) leaked art for a mobile game which had clear Guild Wars designs in it, such as the Inquest symbol and norn homesteads. This art was taken down shortly after popping up on reddit, though [someone managed to save the files on imgur](https://imgur.com/a/i3vCnGE).
---
3. There have been a lot of hirings (both before and after layoffs) for programmers and developers with console game knowledge.
---
The implication here being that the game Kotaku's "source" was talking about is most likely that mobile, and that they had another game in the way early stages (maybe GW, maybe not) that would have been on consoles (as well as PC?).
---
&gt; Is there really another project or are they trying to divert bad leadership and direction of Anet? 
---
There were, but they got scrapped by NCSoft whose CEOs and shareholders wanted immediate profits and had canceled projects in development across all of NCWest - **ArenaNet was not the only one affected by this**. In addition to canceling projects, they forced layoffs for the majority of people (or equivalent of) working on said projects. This all happened early this year.
---
Sneakthief armor (medium) has undyeable gray parts. I like the color of the metal bits and wish to use that color elsewhere. Does anyone know what color it is?
---
It's been slowly feeling more and more like NCSoft is taking a tighter grip on ArenaNet and their direction ever since the layoffs, so I imagine that you're more or less right. Seems to me it's a case of "how Mo wants the company to be run" versus "how NCSoft is demanding the company to be run", and Mo decided to cut his losses at this point.
---
I'll be surprised if Manaworks ends up under a larger publisher company like ArenaNet did.
---
psst. You destroying their magical word with facts. How dare you! :P
---
Theres actually a couple sigils/runes you can pick that sell for a decent amount of gold. I probably made like 20g from selling the stuff I got, including unid dyes.
---
Kiss your scrotum :D
---
xD looks amazing
---
&gt; the increase in revenue from going on Steam would not outweigh the loss in revenue from that 30%
---
That is only assuming that the people who would buy the game thru steam were going to buy it anyway.  Steam undoubtedly would increase the games exposure and get some sales from players that would not but the game otherwise.  It's impossible to tell how many sales it would cannibalize from current sales avenues.
---
Metabattle is still fine. Other then antitoxin not being used anymore, none of the builds changed enough for it to make a huge difference. You'll find condition builds being more viable then before but questionable if you'd want to invest in one. If you're just following a pug tag, metabattle has you covered. If you're following a guild, I'd suggest asking them for a build.
---
Oh, and as an added bonus, you'd know that anyone who loads into the world less than three and a half minutes after logging in is a philistine that doesn't like Metal Legion.
---
Kill minotaurs and moas. You'll get what you need quick enough. :)
---
Necro.  Guardian has a terrible HP pool for some reason.
---
nice "try" ;)
---
Yes, that's it!
---
Thank you.
---
It's probably for the JP that is nextdoor to the lab. The area is sectioned off and your only access is supposed to be via portal
---
The only difference is that Scouges have to use the shade mechanic for the first time and you see more support spellbreaker with the new tactic.
---
Well, this one may be done but I have about 17 more to go so that's the real attempt going on here haha
---
Yeah, it's really nice to have a second healer that absolutely cannot be sent up to do minigames. I think the speed run strategy has the druid tank (as well as some very interesting Quickness sources)
---
I also vote necromancer, but not necessarily Reaper.
---
I used to play power reaper in open world a lot. It's okay, but not braindead/faceroll to me. The greatsword doesn't do a lot of damage right away, and it's generally slow. Going into Shroud is a ton of damage, but you can't stay in it for very long. It makes for a very inconsistent experience between tearing things to shreds and whacking things with a heavy pool noodle. Also, the lack of decent ranged damage means you have to spend a lot of extra time walking up to your target's face before you can kill it, and melee hate is something ArenaNet likes to put in boss fights in open world.
---
So, I revisited an old core necromancer build, the [Life Blast spammer.](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?PSwAYhjlRExuKbapNsw2ZkOyS9LXA-zxQYho4jfHxohzICpaFqKreQCkUAA-e) This one is adapted specifically for open world and staying in Death Shroud as long as possible, while being very easy to play.
---
You basically just enter Death Shroud and spam Life Blast, and cast Shroud 3 on cooldown to refill some Life Force. If you don't take any damage, you can stay in Death Shroud this way for up to 90 seconds realistic. (100 seconds is possible in a vacuum, but the timing is too close for most situations.) Life Force runs out at a rate of 3% per second as core necromancer, as opposed to 5% for Reaper; and with Signet of Undeath and Shroud 3, you can reduce this to just over 1% per second on average.
---
This smaller decay also means you can afford to take some damage in Death Shroud without immediately losing your biggest source of damage. Death Shroud has the same 50% direct damage reduction as Reaper, so you aren't missing out there, either.
---
When your Life Force runs out, just refill it with staff and/or daggers. Use staff 4 for damage and Life Force rather than for the condition transfer; it actually has decent power scaling. Dagger 4 serves as your condition cleansing if you need it, and dagger 2 is your primary heal skill.
---
Your Death Shroud abilities inherit the Weapon Strength of the weapon you had active when you first entered Death Shroud. This means you will do 10% more damage if you entered Death Shroud with staff active, rather than daggers. This is really the only thing you have to think about when playing this build, only enter Death Shroud with staff active.
---
Pushing for 100% crit chance while in Death Shroud is also very important, since Life Blast is a slow, heavy hit that does a lot of damage on crit, but not a lot if it doesn't crit. You want all of them to always crit in level 80 maps, or it'll take too long to kill anything. Adding Assassin gear is very worth it to make sure you reach this threshold.
---
You can [adjust this build to add minions](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PSwAYhjlFExmKbaptqw2YkOyOVLXA-zxQYho4jfHxohzICpaFqKreQCkUAA-e) and make it a different kind of faceroll, I just don't like minions. Note that Signet of Undeath remains in the build; it is incredibly important to keep it at all times with this build. By itself, it reduces your Life Shroud decay from 3% to 2%, which is a 50% increase in Death Shroud's total duration.
---
TL;DR Necromancer, but Reaper is in my opinion not the best option for solo play. Core necromancer Life Blast build is great right now.
---
B-e-a-utiful!
---
Really like your style (both the drawing and the fashion wars) 
---
I can’t imagine how many hours you spend practising- but they really paid off!
---
P.S. what armor skins are you using?
---
You could also go for f2p account to re-experience all the achievements from scratch.
---
But yeah, i get you. 
---
I did a lot of those "classic" level ups, along with some made up rules to make things more challenging and interesting.
---
Just be sure to have some goals and plans ready once you get lvl 80.
---
Often vets that lvl up a new char for the sake of taking it easy and enjoying the leveling experience dont known where to go next.
---
Dungeons and fractals, world bosses and map exploration is a good start.
---
Southsun cove, dry tops, jumping puzzles (no mounts or gliders) is also good fun
---
Even replaying zhaitan story, specially season 2 which most people havent touched on for years can give you a feeling of doing something new.
---
Changing up builds also helps out
---
Oh shit, yeah I’m going full dumb and saying expansion when I mean whole new game.  My bad, good catch.
---
Yes I’m all for more expansions for GW2.  It seems a good cadence is one paid expansion every 2yrs with new maps, new masteries, new elite specs and some cool new system like gliding or mounts, interspersed with free content updates.  The game gets the benefit of a big advertising push every 2yrs, the players get new stuff, and ANet gets an infusion of cash.
---
ANet had that briefly between HoT and PoF, then apparently discarded it when they started moving significant resources off GW2 onto the mobile game or whatever.
---
just make a authotkey script which clicks through all of this stuff within seconds
---
I don’t have the twitch clip anymore but during one of the WvW streams they do on Thursdays, a different guy was with Ben and Raymond and casually talked about them working on a new game.  Not many people seemed to catch or acknowledge it but I thought it was interesting.  This happened maybe a month or so ago.
---
The watch promo happened about the same time, maybe a week off?  The company promoting it on their social media said something about “to celebrate the launch of their new game”.  It was clearly a GW2 watch but kind of eye opening to me that they too mentioned a new game.  Whether someone missed the mark or not on their wording, I still thought it was interesting.
---
Either way with everything going on, it’s not surprising to me at all that Anet was working on another game in addition to supporting GW2.  I’m kind of surprised MO has left the company but he seems happy starting a new one with some close and talented friends.
---
Yeah, I tend to agree. Why do you think nobody has the ability to do it?
---
the chainloader can only support so many addons, d912pxy doesnt play at all with reshade/hook right now. i'm still waiting for this addon loader https://github.com/fmmmlee/GW2-Addon-Manager to get reshade/hook in there.
---
PvP will take a fuckton of time. It requires 0% skill, it's true, you can literally roll your face over the keyboard every match, lose it, and still get the armor. But it will inevitably take more time than any other legendary set.   
---
\+ if you are a PvE player, why waste that precious time being involved in something you do not enjoy. Getting a legendary PvE armor is a great reason to learn and get some raid experience.
---
The technology simply isn't there yet.
---
Looks awesome! I like your use of colors on the character.
---
 This picture reminds me a lot of the concept art for Guild Wars as well, is that on purpose?
---
That doesn't work, because backing up on most mounts makes both the rider and mount 'look over the shoulder'. 
---
Free-camming only works while the left mouse button is depressed, so there is a high risk of having either a shaky, drifting cam or in case of a laser mouse, lasing something or oneself, if turned upside down. Once the mouse button is released the mount will automatically turn around to move relative to the cameras direction of aim. 
---
The hopper walk is utterly unusable since it does the kangaroo walk, where it bows over on it's front legs before dragging it's hindquarters forwards, and most vanilla mount meshes either obstruct the rider partially or completely from an eye level perspective. 
---
I tried this back in April before shooting the clips and that's why I didn't use that.
---
I feel you. I have a level 80 thief leveled that way and the annoying level up reward icon is still in the lower right corner
---
Well I used to mystic forge the exotic gear that you get and often enough got exotics back that were about 10g
---
I think it's a bit of an assumption to say that PvP is what holds player interest for the longest time, too, honestly. I'm not saying it won't hold player interest, it provably *will* hold interest. Merely that I know plenty of people who've played WoW since 2005 and always raided. It's what they play the game for. That, and playing with their raid guild friends.
---
The fact that PvE content is less watchable on twitch doesn't invalidate it as an important draw. I mean, when Method did their Uldir progress stream, WoW viewer numbers **exploded**. The people who are interested are there. The thing is just that PvE content isn't as interesting to watch as PvP in general, on a long term basis, as it is to do it yourself.
---
And as for who's most famous, I knew about Nihilum, Ensidia, Paragon and so on (and some of their players) long before I had the faintest clue about who Swifty was. And I still have no idea who Reckful is.
---
Again, my point is just that there's a very wide audience for MMO games. PvP is one (important) aspect of many of them, but it is still just that. One aspect.
---
While leveling https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Power_DPS
---
Once you get Dragonhunter https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Dragonhunter_-_Power_DPS
---
I have multiple characters where i just kept this thing in the corner.
---
so i guess d912pxy will not work with ReShade on windows 7
---
Halloween is a good time to start the game! Clock tower is something I always come back to.
---
Also a star next to your name, which is as nice as a lukewarm tap water when I am slightly thirsty
---
Does Steam take a percentage only from game/expansion sales, or would they also take a share of all in-game gem purchases as well?
---
Nice, Deimos would be jealous of those horns.
---
True.
---
awesome drawing. i really love it.   
---
only thing i would feed back on( as a fencer) is the sword:  
---
does that sword exist ingame? if so discount the stuff below, unless you're interested just in generaal
---
as it has a Sabre style cup hilt , but has a thin blade such as a short sword (but longer than small sword)  
---
if it is a rapier, the width of the blade needs to be more wider, it has to come out the centre of the guard,   
---
and the guard itself is just tubes of metal normally, specifically with rapier, there is a cross bar that makes a segment for you to feed your index into,  you hold it more like a gun than a normal sword ( short sword / long sword/ broad sword / sabre )
---
Narco best class to get rich.
---
If you play PvP or WvW you'll have more Obsidian Shards than you know what to do with. I have stacks of that shit sitting in the bank.
---
Nah, Karma is still largely useless. I'm sure some people found creative uses for it but a lot of people will also easily hoard millions of it.
---
I know a lot of people who tried gw2 but could not get into it for being too confusing because of all the trash in inventory. People get confused by what to keep and what not to keep.
---
These a re group content builds though. If you're into open world / story, you may consider changing them a bit. In open world it's also worth noting you'll need self buffing, so quickbrand seems better choice than DH when running solo. DH's damage is awesome but it's mostly overkill in open world, while quickbrand offers more boons and lower cooldowns, making exploration smoother.
---
Where do you get them there? From exalt chests? I was never really paying attention to them while in Tarir because by the time hot was out, I had an entire character full of obsi stacks from our blessed Silverwastes.
---
Don't think I'll ever need more as long as the game is live
---
I've seen this before with some guy i ran fractals with.
---
He explained what causes this but i can't quite remember.
---
Just that it only happens with really old accounts.
---
WF introduces buyable build templates (3 for free + 3 to buy) and the WF community is not throwing a hissy fit...
---
you can learn something from them, dear GW2 com. 
---
grow up.
---
Just do PoF hero points, they're fairly easy to solo.
---
It also wouldn't change the amount of content in the episode if you completed it in 3 hours or across 3 days.
---
Well it's not exactly heartfelt caring, it's more like, just a feeling of taking something too seriously for what it is.
---
 Sorting my inventory is some of the most boring stuff I do in the game. I don't know how to describe it, it's like, you're walking with a spoonful of oil, trying not to spill anything, and you're forgetting everything else around you, but then you realize you really don't ACTUALLY care about the spoon all that much, and it scares you that you still feel obliged not to spill anything.
---
We need #3, it already exists in the game but it's exclusive to Flame Legion only
---
doesn't work for me
---
Yeah think it was from exalted chests. I never farmed sw all that much. Zone just felt very dreary. I farmed Tarir so much I even built/styled one of my main characters after it. The good ol' days of opening 120 giant orb chests every hour.
---
Got a buddy with a name like this. It happens to old recovered accounts from GW1.
---
You might want to explain first how builds work in WF, how versitile one class is, how many game modes there are, how much gear influences the build. For context.
---
We spent fucking months to craft a legendary and all of the ascended equipment is timegated What the fuck are you on about mate?
---
But did they have free unlimited build templates that were taken away? Mr grown up.
---
Hearing a special guitar riff playing too? ^^
---
It's more likely Anet moves to the Epic Games launcher because they only take 12% taxes. Valve 30%.. but Steam has more potential players
---
This is mentioned in [the support article](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000728148-I-Want-to-Change-My-Display-Name) about changing your account name.
---
&gt; - You linked your Guild Wars account with your Guild Wars 2 account and now see a long string of numbers and letters as your display name. (i.e. ABC12EFG-3H4I-JK56-7LMO-PQR8ST9UVWXY)
---
Well, it's a mix of gaming tasks and procrastination then.
---
[Reminder this happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KayQSPWkXSc)
---
I use this build with the blood magic variant. It has some usage tips towards the bottom of the page, in addition to what the other folks here posted. It also has a good trait breakdown and possible alternatives. https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Power_Minion_Master
---
"If I fits I sits" does not apply in this case, Anet
---
as far as I remember, the gem shop and steam's contract clauses are incompatible.
---
i forget the specifics but that was the rationale back when the game was released.  no idea if steam's policies have shifted to allow it since then though.
---
regarding dungeon tokens: did you check if its maybe more profitable to buy the runes/sigils and salvage them for charms/symbols instead of the rare/exo gear for globs?
---
Also, even though no currency either, I think exotic essences of luck got a new method of turning them into gold via a festival vendor last year, IIRC, but not sure if it was halloween or wintersday. u/enko63 should know some details.
---
And seeing all those level up scrolls and tomes in your bank, maybe its worth looking into level up rewards for one of your next videos. Should be able to squeeze out a couple of gold out of those as well, if you make the right choices. And you can also still obtain some old boosters to make enchanted reward boosts.
---
I just jumped on after years of not playing. Opened all my birthday gifts and had level 60 boosts on each character. Besides my level 80 all my alts were between level 5 and 10.
---
It was annoying as hell but I did this for every one of them.
---
I haven't played core necro forever, this is a great reminder to try it again even for less newer players. 
---
That said, I think you characterized reaper a bit poorly. I came up with a similar build for reaper that also focuses on maximum shroud uptime, and can stay in it for quite a while. 
---
Reaper life reap (auto attack 3rd chain) gives a life force point per enemy hit. If you take the second master trait, you also gain life force and gain might when hitting a frozen target, which you have permanent uptime between focus 5, shadow beast activation, and reaper 5,4 combo and reaper 3 and staff 5 (from fear). Finally, I also make use of the signet of undeath for a passive 1% per second. All told, you can lose a mere between 0% and 2% per second while dealing a ton of damage. 
---
It's probably less reliable than core necro since it has more moving parts so to speak, but it's a lot of fun. I can upload the build if anyone is interested.
---
Edit: I tried core necro again, and while it is great at surviving and dealing consistent dps, the damage ceiling isn't nearly as high as reaper. Still, personal preference.
---
&gt; you need to be on EU to participate
---
Aww, too bad. Maybe next time.
---
You can't see your own star.
---
To get initiative back from unload all hits have to land but they don't have to be on the same target.
---
&gt;  Quite handy during Wintersday orphan runs.
---
How Dare You!!
---
Beside Bonfires and those fireworks you can buy for gems on Halloween and Dragonbash, Karma Booster are the only way to get the old [Magic Find buff](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_Find_Boost). You need two to exchange them to one MF boost. 
---
These +50% magic find are pretty good for Halloween Labyrinth farms.
---
I wish mine just centered on my screen. Instead of down  and to the side.
---
The strike was easy for good players. Doesn't mean it was bad content. I'd argue there is a difference between easy and bad.
---
Ironic. He could flex to others, but not to himself

Ah. Still on season 3 before I do PoF.
---
Thanks
---
Well HoT too but it's generally trickier, still tons of soloable HPs there
---

---
Play [this](https://youtu.be/eab_eFtTKFs) while you do it.
---
It won't make it any faster, but it'll make it more bearable.
---
It would be nice if an account could skip this without losing the items once they have leveled up a chaacter to 80 already.  They could use the "Excess loot" panel for this when getting level ups while one is already up, the old one would be sent to the inventory directly.  
---
They could also give a minimum 1 copper value to items that are not particularly important, or at least allow salvaging them for some junk or glittering dust.
---
Are you playing on a Mac by chance?

2 other people and me have the same issue and we are all using the 64bit Mac client.
---
L2P, you noob.
---
I tried all settings possible. The picture in the post is on "Best Appearance".
---
Actually, Mist Form is the only bad skill among the ones you mention. It makes completely invulnerable and gives a speed boost to a character that has already a large amount of condition removal and movement options. Every single one of their weapons has something that gives vigor or an evade, or a way to remove or endure conditions. Every. Single. One.  
---
There's no point of making elementalist squishy to compensate for all that damage, evade and condition removal spam in their skills if they also get invulnerability on top of that like Mist Form and Obsidian Flesh.   
---
I'd go with replacing as many invulnerabilities as possible with barrier. Starting with the ones that last the longest. Even for other professions.    
---
Same for skills that counter-heal like Infuse Light and A.E.D. . Instead healing those insane amounts, they should heal a more reasonable base amount, and give the rest of the healing as barrier instead, so all that massive excess healing is only temporary.  
---
Barrier is not being used enough, and when it's used is on top of other things. It should be used to balance out healing replacing it with temporary health when builds are too bunkerish. 
---
* Distortion makes the character invulnerable, but it has a short duration, it doesn't give bonus movement like Mist Form and it has a considerable cooldown.  
---
* Evade can be countered with Wards.
---
 * But there's not enough wards. The solution isn't getting less evade, it's making more skills into wards. 
---
* Dagger storm also gives stability so it's also immune to wards, but it's an elite. It should be that strong. The cooldown is too short, tho. Elites should be tide-turners you save to use at the right moment, not part of a standard rotation. Of course there's exceptions to everything, to this too. For elites that's more passive skills with weaker effects like flesh golem, mortar and signets.

hi i promised to do a f2p roaming vid some time ago and now i finally had the time for it. playing pure glass core shatter mesmer. the few oneshots are only for editing purposes as always and none of the ppl i attacked were afk and they all could see me being around before i attacked/ stealthed. 
---
pls notice the vid description/ pinned comment under the vid. feedback, esp a comment on youtube, a like and a subs are always welcome to support my channel. :) 
---
sry for the noob editing btw...
---
GIVEAWAY: 5 Aurene Outfit codes will be given away! all you need to do is to comment on the video on youtube and add "aurene ftw" and you are in. more informations you can find in the vid description/ pinned comment under the vid on youtube. good luck!
---
i hope you can enjoy!  greetings jazz

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiYTP2zsDZA
---
that shouldn't be an issue. FWIW i run on minimum because potato, and the codes still show up.
---
I have witnessed this personally on two different Macs and spoken to people in map chat who have the same issue.
---
Because Everquest 1 is the original mainstream MMO, even though Ultima Online was better.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Once WoW became WoW EQ2 just did not bring the EQ1 audience with it
---
Imagine neglecting an entire game mode of which a large playerbase at least used to play. 
---
No wait, imagine being dumb enough to actually think a game has to be a designated pvp game to have pvp
---
Deleting the character will delete all the items tho!
---
You can get to 500 crafting level 400-425 stuff and with discovery, but you will not get some of the items required for ascended recipes without the collections, like the composter.
---
Don't think so.. 
---
But what's the problem with it anyways? I mean, you get a free gardening plot, a cooking station in your home instance which gives you finally access to a bank tap in home! So I would highly recommend it anyways 😉
---
One random clone performs the ambush skill instead of all three.
---
Some of the loot I like, like the superior sigil of nullification or the boosters. My issue is that you have to click through all of them 80 times without any sort of collect all feature.
---
butwhy.jpg
---
Honestly, sounds like you have a great grasp of the game and are doing things most people recommend. If you’re looking for a bit of a challenge, try taking on places closer to your level. Crafting could also be something cool to explore, and just so you know in terms of speed, events are going to be much more effective for getting exp so try not to skip out on them for hearts or exploration. Definitely give all the weapon combos a try and se which ones you like best, and just have a ton of fun. 
---
As for buying it, I would wait until you hit 80, as there’s essentially nothing you can do in the paid content until you are 80. Soon enough you’ll have multiple max level toons and enjoy every second of it.
---
Imagine being in a game where you never actually have to learn what other classes' abilities are and being able to read them and counter them. 
---
Oh wait, imagine being dumb enough to actually think a game should be designed so bronze players feel like they're already Plat.
---
Being able to read and even anticipate invulnerability frames is part of a PvP game's skill. IF Anet is doing it wrong so are the biggest eSports game developers.
---
The point was that that's how some of the most successful and most played PvP games work. GW2's sPvP isn't in a bad state because of the mechanics, which are actually pretty good, it's in a bad place because of the low number of players creating huge skill differences with in matches at higher ELOs.
---
I found the gourmet challenge to be really fun compared to just messing around with discovery over and over. Why not complete the challenge? Didn't you like it?
---
Proof needed.
---
It is, but it's not the same as Antitoxin.  It was super fun going into a keep with Antitoxin because if they pulled chilling fog, your zerg actually got a massive boost because you would just instantly convert chill to alacrity.
---
I love playing soulbeast. The depth of the class comes mostly from the second weapon set. You can play greatsword, dagger/axe, sword/axe, or axe/axe, letting you both deal good damage in melee range and adds some complexity to rotations (cause my brain would fall out if I just pressed 2 every 8 seconds)... Not to mention merges add some ridiculous amounts of damage (looking at you, smokescale!).
---
That's a bad reason. You fix the bug and/or you punish the abusers instead of annoying people everytime they use tome of knowledge on a new character. They could even simply have a merchant trading 80 tome of knowledge into a level 80 scroll !
---
Well I would say soulbeast is the easiest of theses classes and you can easily equip another weapon set on your 2nd hand for group content. also soulbeast has an insane selfbuff potential  maybe even more than deadyeye
---
but well in the end it should matter on yourself what class you prefer to play the most. But weaver is clearly the hardest to play in open world
---
I'd prefer the text "oops" instead. but nice general idea.
---
Of course, you're then basically asking for people to come rub you. Not everyone is into that.
---
Six? You need at least one of each class.
---
I don't think they're worried about an existing bug, it's just precautionary. Maybe?
---
I actually had the opposite problem where the quality meat took way more kills to drop, while I got poultry from maybe the 5th Moa.
---
I always like my asura to have big ears, I like seeing them juggling when he/she's moving around ... So cute
---
Take my updoot
---
Here to see that they are equal- https://youtu.be/zfPMjT4R4WE
---
Why not both?
---
I have 30+ characters with unique looks including 6 Asura
---
Here: https://youtu.be/k-chWGFRtIc?t=2645
---
I was just meaning that consortium is faster than normal tools regardless of cancelling. Good to know its identical to the other one though!
---
You know I'm going to say something positive about build templates we got the news a month before the release and an actual date for their release.
---
this game isnt like other games. When have you seen a necromancer holding an axe? Or a guardian with a staff? Or an elementalist with a sword? If youve tried EVERYTHING then this isnt the game for you. Otherwise try rev s/s + staff, warrior sword, weaver sword/dagger, what class do you enjoy playing?
---
Yea that's true
---
Most of the changes you'll see are minor like scrappers not running anti toxin, scourges swapping stats to cele,grieving, or other condi sets if they don't feel like running power but the gameplay will mostly remain the same.
---
in most pug groups condi FB will generally outperform power FB (speaking from plenty of experience after playing both), thanks to the relatively short rampup time on such a heavily burn-based build.
---
though you'll eventually get a knack for figuring out how good the group is after a single pull and you can decide from there. tbh this is the one spot where i'm excited for build templates lol
---
side note: in tryhard groups you're better off prestacking quickness and then swapping to dh  for some of the fights lmao
---
No
---
&gt; https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=k-chWGFRtIc&amp;t=41m35s
---
&gt; Quite crucial and being overlooked by the video.
---
What if I want my equipment to stay in my inventory while being  used for gear templates?
---
I really don't see why skills+traits templates were not a day one feature (or since the day trait reset became free) since it's the exact same thing as skills+attribute points templates.
---
Only way I can think of sucks but..
---
Don’t equip anything in anything but gear slot one and load via code very time.
---
What’s your reason for wanting it to return to inventory?
---
That's a weird way to spell "sylvari".
---
The logos are black and white, this is so well executed.
---
its funny that there are a lot of competitive games arround where the exact same mechanic gets used.  
---
maybe the problem is just you and not bad game design.
---
Hi, I've elaborated the expectations a bit better on our Rules for Ghouls page since you commented. Apologies for the delayed response!
---
You may, and even should, remove the UI from your screenshots for the best appearance. 
---
Full body shots are ideal for front/back shots because we want your boots to be noticeable. Especially if you can manage to get it super close in and still show the boots, that is especially appreciated. Screenshots where the costume pieces are indistinguishable due to low quality screenshots/angles/coloring/settings tend to do less favorably in the open voting. 
---
There are some camera settings (F11 --&gt; first tab --&gt; Camera) and you can play with the vertical position/horizontal position/field of view options etc to get some pretty cool screenshots. I recommend checking out the Winners page on our website. The top two winners of our last in-house contest both use those settings to get better shots.
---
https://xunlaiheroes.wixsite.com/xhsa/winners
---
You don't have to be an armchair developer when someone else has already made a better version.
---
My most diverse character is my necro with 5 gear sets, guardian has 4. Both with legendary armor so I only have to swap trinkets and weapons which are nicely organized in my inventory. I will try to get used to without templates. 
---
Taking a look at my other characters I realized that since I stopped raiding my other characters actually have only 2 real builds that I use. For those I will use the two gear templates. Before the last chrono changes I would have been actually annoyed because I took the time to create the perfect gear templates for every scenario. Anet already took the pain away from me. 
---
Now I'm like yeah whatever, I can play comfortably without paying but I feel really bad for those who play raids or generally multiple game modes.
---
free keys are free keys...
---
It is about Asura being the masterrace. Got 70 slots here, still mostly Asura.
---
Or as my friends say, i love rats :(
---
I had to quit playing like a month into HoT and just started up again November last year. 
---
It was definitely a new experience all over again and also a pain in the ass because it sucked to have forgotten damn near everything lol.
---
Might honestly want to color them lol, took me a moment...
---
Accurate description from a pvp point of view.
---
When I head that I idea I just rolled with it.
---
Do you know what the definition of a subjective opinion is?
---
"the code is like, totally there. They just have to copy and paste, its so easy. It can take like, 20 seconds, but they don't know how to do it. The code is already there!"
---
Something that is meant for simple convenience turns into a clunky, bloated mess that is loaded with a host of its own inconveniences. And it's locked behind three different levels of monetization, and even if you spend the maximum amount, is extremely limited and limiting. So yeah it's subjective, but it's so clearly inferior and anyone who is a multi class multi build player (you know, the kinda person who needs build/equipment templates) can see it from a mile away.
---
Subjective and also ignorant.
---
Time is an illusion. Everything happens at once.
---
Its unlockable on other characters as well (you gotta bump chef to 500 and give npc this rare food plate in order to activate his vendor ability) but only original character who did the achievement will get the pimped out design
---
Well I have 1 character and only 60% world completion and I just hit level 80 2 days ago so.. yeah I’m not advanced in the game teehee
---
&gt; the game is a product
---
wrong, the game is a service
---
That's a weird way to spell "Salad"
---
Does that invalidate the point I made?
---
They have to offer something in exchange for that money, it's their responsibility to make it worth in the eyes of the paying consumers.
---
So you ordered 7 Infusions  
---
6 of them for \~1 gold  
---
and one for 1.3k which is usualy traded around 1.8k??
---
What exactly is your Point?
---
That's fair however I feel as if it's beyond absurd levels with this community and game, as in there are so many people asking for so many different things and wanting their specific thing to be a reality that it's literally exhausting sometimes just to look at this sub reddit, seeing people constantly huffing and puffing about how this or that sucks.
---
Look, I agree the game's not perfect and never has been but I certainly have enjoyed my time with it and I think it's fair to say that many of the people making these complaints, to some extent, must enjoy it too - I get that it doesn't reach everyone's expectations but man, can we hold fire for.. anytime at all? 
---
I dunno, guess there is no point appealing to reason, after all 'news esc' sites like these thrive on negative topics and information rather than anything neutral or positive, that isn't their fault just human nature after all.
---
Perhaps I should be the one taking a break from using this sub :P
---
[removed]
---
Honestly I thought it was self-explanatory; I made a 1350 gold order just from playing PvP.
---
As for the 1g orders, those are my way of "saving" items I wan to buy eventually.
---
&gt; They have to offer something in exchange for that money, it's their responsibility to make it worth in the eyes of the paying consumers.
---
Your biggest mistake is an assumption they won't make money on templates.
---
anet is banning a 3rd party tool the community has been using for years and replacing it with a worse one that's monetized. the outrage is more than justified. shut the fuck up shill
---
Thanks for the sauce
---
What you’re doing isn’t new haha that’s just a “pip farm”. 
---
That’s basically what “ranked” is to everyone who plays it since the actual coordinated/organized pvp is only at the AT/mAT, lol.
---
But..
---
Saying nothing of tactical importance is said on map chat is ignorant so don’t recommend that to others please.
---
(Even) If 90% is static it’s still 10% viable tactics so turning off chats isn’t smart but whatever..
---
Have fun and good luck
---
Yeah, I would've liked to see more of Logan in War Eternal, not only to have his payback on Kralk after the events of *Edge of Destiny* but also to let him and Aurene share a moment where he'd apologize to her for not being there to help Glint, while Aurene would forgive him as ultimately it was important for the world for Logan to save Jennah over Glint (or else the [Ebonhawke Treaty](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ebonhawke_Treaty) would never have become a thing). Ditto for him meeting Snaff's ghost and having reconciliation with him (as both Eir and Snaff should've appeared on Dragonfall as Glint's generals).
---
I say we shouldn't count Logan out of The Icebrood Saga just yet. Our chat with Marjory in "A Race to Arms" suggests that Kasmeer will go inform Logan on the events of Bound by Blood, ask Logan to keep the volatile human elements calm as news spread of Bangar's actions, and persuade him and Malice to exchange intel.
---
If the Separatist threat is truly rising despite us cutting off their major White Mantle funding back in Season 3, and if the Legions and the three orders truly have Renegade moles in them to repeat the [Trybulus Griefblade](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trybulus_Griefblade) fiasco from personal story's Ash Legion plot branch, the ramifications would be grave. Logan will have to keep an eye out on not only seemingly friendly charr ambassadors and charr visitors in LA and DR but also within the Pact as technically any charr out there can be a potential Renegade sympathizer now who are biding their time to attack (just like we heard in "Deeper and Deeper" how the Renegades were willing to assassinate the other Imperators but were ordered not to make a move until our antagonist has "evened the odds").
---
One of the missed opportunities of Season 3 was not capitalizing on the paranoia that any human member of the Pact and the orders could've been a White Mantle spy all along since personal story as these spies were more or less rooted out since episodes 4 and 6, but the Renegade spy storyline can still reuse that idea with this racial switch to charr and pay off on it. Imagine if Renegades have infiltrated the Black Lion Trading Company, or have shady deals with the Inquest or the Consortium's so far unseen and mysterious leaders, or perhaps they even broker a deal with the Centaur Alliance so they can get more human-hating allies to work with (as the Jormag trailer did show centaurs enslaving humans in what appeared to be Woodland Cascades). If Separatists also have a new mysterious financial backer that enables their rising activity despite their great losses from Season 3, we could be onto quite the juicy political mess here. And if Renegades and/or Separatists (and the rogue warbands from Bound by Blood) end up jeopardizing the Ebonhawke Treaty and thus threaten not only Ascalon but Kryta's safety, that would also force our favorite [E](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/E) into action as E's interests lie not only in Elder Dragon threats like Jormag but also on the survival of humanity.
---
Logan story wouldn't need to touch just this political powderkeg or his likely complicated future relationship with Malice, however. In *Edge of Destiny* Rytlock gave him a Blood Legion amulet which symbolically made him a member of the Blood Legion and his brother in blood. If we ever meet other members of the Stone Warband beyond Crecia, I can imagine they'll be none too happy about having a human mouse as a member of their prestigious warband, and may view Rytlock as having betrayed the warband's ideals. Logan trying to win the trust of Rytlock's warband (assuming they aren't simply villains for the most part via following their Imperator's orders) could be a fascinating tale and lead Logan on a journey of discovery about charr culture so he'll come to understand them and their fears and desires more from a sympathetic angle.
---
Finally, there's the unresolved Krytan Locket and Magdaer storyline in regards to the Heir of Ascalon plot from Season 2. According to a prophecy the Foefire curse can only be lifted if the true Heir wields [King Adelbern's crown](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/King_Adelbern%27s_crown), and Sohothin or Magdaer while casting a ritual. It partially failed when Rytlock tried it, which suggests the ritual may in fact require all three royal artifacts and the appearance of the true Heir. Back in personal story's human plot branch the Order of Whispers mentioned they knew of someone next in line to the throne if anything happened to the childless Jennah, so that plot could be tied into the Krytan locket (which shows the heir) to locate this mysterious claimant to the throne, especially as Logan mentioned that more heirs to Doric's bloodline can be found in Kryta etc. despite the Ascalon bloodline (Barradin and Adelbern's families) are dead with Rurik and Althea.
---
Eir also intended Logan to have the reforged Magdaer so he and Rytlock could mend the rift that had formed between them, so it'd make sense for the Foefire cleansing ritual to be performed by not only Rytlock (wielding Sohothin which represents Ascalon's charr present) but Logan (who'd wield Magdaer which represents Ascalon's human past) and potentially the Heir as well (wearing Adelbern's crown to represent Ascalon's true future where charr and humans can finally live in peace side by side).
---
Just imagine if we succeeded in this ritual and somehow convinced the ghostly Adelbern and Barradin, who would no longer be compelled by the curse's madness, to come to our aid as e.g. Jormag's growing army of warmongers is threatening not only the human Kryta but the charr Ascalon as well. It'd be sweet irony to have ghostly Rurik and Althea convince their warmongering parents to let go of their hatred of charr (and have Rurik and Adelbern forgive one another to end their little family drama) and come to the aid of Ebonhawke and the Black Citadel which might be besieged by Icebrood (and/or Renegades). Adelbern and Barradin's redemption arc could culminate in their selfless sacrifice (instead of Adelbern's originally selfish motivations to cast the Foefire) to prevent the two cities from falling into the enemy's hands with a bittersweet sendoff to these ghostly leaders of Ascalon not as tragic villains but as honorable heroes like they were back in the time of the Second Guild War in lore. Rurik and Althea could then have their happily ever after in the Mists as the new leaders of Ascalonian ghosts while officially acknowledging the Heir of Ascalon as their true inheritor before their departure, and the Heir could rally the Separatists behind him/her and persuade them to become a more benevolent Royalist faction (instead of the warmongering Royalists of pre-Searing Ascalon) so Ascalon would no longer have to worry about being annexed to Kryta and they'd also learn to trust the charr and Jennah's faction under the Heir's guidance.
---
I could even imagine a ceremony to commemorate Adelbern's (this time noble) sacrifice to not doom but save charr and humans and the Heir's rise with Logan paraphrasing the touching words of the [Monument of King's Watch](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Historical_Monument_of_King%27s_Watch) (where Ascalonian kings used to be crowned) while the charr and the redeemed ghosts of Ascalon alike applaud side by side as a true era of prosperity and peace begins between their two races:
---
 &gt; To endure is greater than to dare;  
---
&gt; To keep heart when all have lost it;  
---
&gt; To forego even one's own life when the end is gained;   
---
&gt; Who can say this is not greatness?  
---
&gt; On this site, more than one hundred years prior, the first king of the new Republic of Ascalon was crowned. It was dedicated, on this, the ninety-fifth day of the year, in the Season of the Phoenix, in honor of the passing of the greatest of all kings. This stone stands in memory to the first of all sons of Ascalon, King Doric. For it is through his sacrifice that we now live on. May his blood have been spilled for the good of all.  
---
That way we'd tie all these plot threads (Renegade spy plot within various organizations, rising Separatist activity, Logan and E's involvement, the search for the Heir of Ascalon, and the Foefire cleansing) together with Logan playing a notable role in all of them and thus keeping him relevant. Plus I'd love Logan to actually have a chat with Elder Dragon Aurene about Glint at some point to lift that weight of guilt off his burdened heart at long last. :)
---
There’s your answer then.
---
Wow! Neat! What a deal! I'll pay 1k gems for that
---
Tbh I hate that I have to ‘confirm’ the choices.  And click to open the next one.  If they chain opened or all spilled into a single UI, it would be so much better for me.
---
No reason to be so anal, I’m just a new kid enjoying a game 😊
---
So lets take in some numbers; with Matches averaging at 10 minutes (6 matches an hour) , 15-30 Silver per game and average of 10 pips (From Top stats and plat rank as well). Within 1 hour you could make about 3~4 gold per, and the 20g spike every 18 games from the Byzantium Chest. 
---
Overall it's about 9~11 gold per hour, not too bad if you're a dedicated Pvper. Tournaments can net you 10-20g as well(+Mystic Coins) and only last for about an hour, based on the amount of teams.
---
Yes, vocal community act like spoiled children, always demanding for more, and more, and more, and when they finally get what they want, they are never happy.
---
Really don't think it's any one thing in particular that'll drive people out, just a combination of the many lately. 
---
Questionable balance changes, wvw/pvp being a mess, build templates etc.
---
Even if none are enough to outright sink someone's faith in the game having plenty of issues like this are enough to slowly erode it out from under them.
---
Participating in the meta events yields you some map currency + a lot of Unid. Rare bags + some items. Overall outcome is Ecto + crafting materials + karma.
---
Basically, just follow the commander and reap the profit.
---
Where is pbm holo?
---
I cant say much for DE and SB in open world, but staff weaver isnt really as good as it once was due to anet nerfs. It used to be a fabulous weapon but because its extremely high dps was too far away from even the 2nd best class, its usefulness as dps weapon has been gutted. Eles low basr hp and armor make using it less than ideal trade off, most weavers use sword/dagger or go Tempest for open world fights. Ultimately though GW2 is a game where unless you're running endgame content like raids, you really can play anything you want. But in harder content for Weaver I believe the meta is still sword 9 out of 10 times.
---
I wouldn't waste your time trying to explain something to an anet white knight
---
I actually plan to come back to the game because of the templates.
---
Oh hey, you are the damage scrapper I see all the time in P1!
---
Yah, I just want to make people aware of how profitable PvP has become over the several improvements Anet has done to it.
---
I have 10 and each one of them is different
---
It's just for Core world completion right? It doesn't also include the LW and expansion zones?
---
Where can you buy the skins for karma? I was looking at them on various races and the tier3 ones costed a decent bit of gold (to me at least) hehe.
---
How about they revert everything (PvE) back to 1 year ago and instead of changing the classes in PvE they only increasse the strength and HP of the enemies.
---
Floating down the river
---
i have 14 characters, like 6 or more are 80.. max i have is maybe 70% world complete and i have 400k karma so still nowhere near that amount, i think it just depends on what you do tbh
---
I play mirage after a long hiatus. What's wrong with mirage cloak?
---
&gt; no matter how unfair or greedy it is.
---
It isn't. Anet is monetizing QoL features since day 1 of GW2.
---
&gt; This game is full of players who'll bend over for any kind of monetization Arenanet shoves down their throats
---
You can always use your gameplay earnings, aka gold, to buy the upgrades you need.
---
&gt; But if someone is not happy about how the current state of Templates, they have all the right in the world to complain, specially since they are asking for our money in return
---
Complaining is one thing. Circle jerking about the topic isn't. It is also funny how you act as if build templates were your human right. They aren't. Anet is releasing templates in line with their business model which you accepted the moment you created the account and "signed" the contract.
---
The rumor is that Mo and his small team were prototyping something that could maybe one day have turned into GW3. Afaik there was no indication of a mainline GW being in development before the layoffs in February.
---
Lol!! Damn dude
---
Community : Scourge needs to be buffed in pve and nerfed in wvw.
---
Anet: we've been listening to your concerns and decided to nerf scourge in pve and buff it in wvw, thanks for your feedback.
---
Same, that's what, less than a single Dragonfall run?
---
So what you're saying is you're using a stroke of pure luck and not the average.
---
Yeah, better not think of them as templates.
---
Personally I call them blueprints and loadouts, to differ them internally.
---
Don't lose your head over it
---
more whining from /r/guildwars2, now there's a surprise
---
I had that issue as well. Just had to stick with it and finding the “sell trash” option some vendors have. But yea, there is so many crafting materials and map event items and just tons of stuff ha. Shit I’ve been playing for a little while now and I STILL don’t know what the hell everything in my inventory does ha. I’m learning though, the game is so much fun.
---
in pvp backstab hits with 5k on average already, so...
---
Just you gotta realize that 2m karma is nothin. That’s all he’s gettin at
---
Isn't that the intended behaviour of the grandmaster? Or are you telling me that works without the gm trait equipped too?
---
It's like they're trying to simulate how a real company should operate.
---
If you still have 32-bit client installed, you can use it to see the carvings (that client, being a wrapper around Windows executable, does not have this problem), that's what I did.
---
#HumanMasterRace
---
Iirc the GM trait is a stunbreak in addition to evading, the evading while CC still works without it.
---
Hang on a minute if i'm not mistaken wtf is the scrapper doing in the crowd?? If anything he would be spending equal amounts of time in the ditch as chrono. And while chrono would be wearing the clothing of a rich noble the scrapper would be wearing the raggs of a beggar.
---
Oh wait its because the chrono WAS a noble and thus much more important right?
---
Because no one even notice the death of a beggar... Obviously...
---
Don't make me rant about function gyro and the scrapper "rework" again...

"Let them eat alacrity" -Some chrono
---
and OP is contributing to making it worse even if it wasn't that great to begin with
---
&gt; It isn't. Anet is monetizing QoL features since day 1 of GW2.
---
Doing it from day 1 doesn't make it fair.
---
&gt; You can always use your gameplay earnings, aka gold, to buy the upgrades you need.
---
paying with your time does not make it free, because time is money, unless you are a kid without responsibilities living with your parents.
---
&gt; Complaining is one thing. Circle jerking about the topic isn't. It is also funny how you act as if build templates were your human right. They aren't. Anet is releasing templates in line with their business model which you accepted the moment you created the account and "signed" the contract.
---
We don't have any contract signed with Anet, they offer different things and we chose if we want them or not. You can decide if you want to buy an expansion or a black lion key to gamble, no contract forces you to.
---
Now, as the community who supports this game, likes this game, and has the right to decide if Anet's offering something worth our money, we can complain all we want when that something doesn't meet our expectations or industry standards.
---
You are tired of it? Stay away from these threads, and keep supporting the game the way you see fit.
---
Hmm no eaman is an anagram of my name, has been since forever
---
Great guide. I got the Tokens basically for free by exhanging a fuckton of obsidian shards, mystic stones, chak eggs, aurilium ingots and whatnot for them. Had that stuff piling up for long enough.
---
Nah it's a lot easier to just fuck up everything. You don't have to balance if you just make everything unplayable *taps head*
---
Gear slots can't be loaded via code.
---
I suggest you check the links to the stream.
---
&gt;arc template
---
Oh no Mac version?
---
That's to bad, I wouldn't know how to play without a dps meter and templates, I'm sorry for ya mate.
---
I did.
---
The copy template for gear is per character FROM TEMPLATES YOU ALREADY MADE. (edit clarification: for this specific character.)
---
Sharable via code? ONLY build (as in skill/trait) templates.
---
Then I suggest you also listen to the audio in the first link
---
Nobody:
---
Anet: no more glyph of empowerment, spotter nerfs, spirits no longer pulse boons, ancestral grace no longer evades, ranger shouts are no longer shouts, druid’s pet have -25% stats.
---
Grow a pair.
---
at least now i know why i was getting clapped in wvw constantly wo seeing who's clapping me
---
Do you really count it as abuse if someone tells you to shut up?
---
Also, you are breaking the witch hunt rule by showing the player's name.
---
NOOOO WHAT HAPPENED!! I main scourge!!!
---
I was supposed to update it today, but i didn't get the tempest notes from the person writing it, soonTM
---
That's considered abuse? You should really be careful stepping out of your bubble if you consider that abuse.
---
i feel like this game and this company has reached the point of no return, and im here for the sink till the bitter end
---
Yeah, they're probably going report you for calling them a stupid treb.
---
People need to stop comparing GW2 to GW1. Both are different games, each their own. And especially the engines. It's not because they used the GW1 engine source to build the GW2 engine that they behave the same way. Even if they worked for 1 day, things could be so much different, even in the same engine. What you're suggesting makes no sense. I can have 10 lines of code, and change that in 5 minutes to behave much differently but have the same outcome. Also, build templates... All the skills, the gear... it's stored in a database, not in the engine. So the engine does not have anything to do with the way they implemented build templates in GW2. We have no idea how they store skills, traits and gear in their database. And keep in mind, it has to be stored per character, and on top of that, multiple builds. You can clearly see in the Guild Chat stream, that the UI is designed in such a way (for gear templates) that there's only enough room for x amount of tabs. Sure, they could add a little arrow that lets you scroll left and right through the tabs, but they haven't developed it this way (at least for now).
---
I'm a developer myself (mostly hobby). I'm no Engine or Game developer, but I do know my fair share of how most programming languages work. This video is total bull\*. I like that people stand up and try to give feedback. But it always comes down to the engine. And that is totally wrong. Please think before you just blame the engine, while it has close to 0 % involvement with the feature discussed.
---
EDIT: I do however agree that there should be unlimited (or at least a higher) number of tabs for both gear and build templates.
---
You started it. Someone telling you to shut up when you call them stupid is pretty fair.
---
in game abuse... omg... That is not abuse.
---
&gt; EULA doesn't say that I have to accept and buy anything Anet releases. That would be illegal on so many levels...
---
I never said anything like that. so how about you
---
&gt; read again
---
and btw 
---
&gt; A p2w game (not GW2's case) should be considered fair if they do it from day 1?
---
answer my question
---
Cry more. You’re soft. Jesus...
---
Somewhere beneath them, there is a burried Staff Weaver.
---
They wanted feedbacks and I do appreciate that, but the feedback was for WvW. 
---
Scourge got buffed in WvW, as it can hit the same number of players like a melee impact from before. This ruined it for PvE players... and WvW because neither achieved their desires.
---
While the feedback existed, the execution wasn't a welcomed sight.
---
And the rest goes on for most balancing. There should be splitting amongst game modes.
---
22 sylvari and counting.
---
For provisioner tokens, if you have lots of charged quartz crystals, you can exchange them, without daily gate, the npc is near the ratasum bank.
---
Those help a little bit in some specific situations, but they have cooldowns and restrictions, and the only one of those that's really significant is Spectral Grasp.
---
GS5 is still very inconsistent as to whether or not it pulls things, and it gets eaten by the smallest bump in terrain; it's also slow, so in the time it takes GS5 to pull, you could've just walked up to the mob, so it doesn't save you any time. It's worth casting for the other effects it has, though.
---
RS2 temporarily gives you about 450 movement speed, but only if you use it if it would strike your target. It's a movespeed loss to use it while running around, since it makes you stop briefly at the end of the cast. Also, your Life Force is ticking down very fast the whole time.
---
Spectral Grasp is really good, I used it all the time. It applies Chill for Reaper's damage modifier too. But its cooldown means you can't rely on it all the time, and it still has a bit of trouble sometimes with pulling enemies the entire distance to you.
---
Same, but with Charr. Totally not a furry
---
&gt;  They talked back!
---
*gasp*
---
F
---
this is technically more expensive because of value of using CQCs to craft and sell something else like a Grow Lamp. Hell, the raw cost of the quartz is kind of expensive: 1 CQC = 25x Quartz Crystals = 87s75c (buy orders).
---
Highly recommend *against* using CQCs for provisioner tokens unless you're trying to rush it and don't care about cost.
---
I'm not sure that would actually cause less legendary gear to be made. You have to balance the number of people who would quit making their Nth set of Legendary gear against the people who would be convinced that Legendary gear is now worth it by the change. I bet the latter group is bigger.
---
Probably one of /r/Guildwars2's most prolific trolls.  Shows up every few months to complain about something stupid and makes themselves look like even more of a fool than your prior impression. Comment history is super yikes.
---
You are correct that you were abusive towards another player and should be punished. 
---
You've also violated the rules of this subreddit by making a posting that's worthless other than as a source of drama.
---
I think templates are actually very positive. Let them be released first. I’m sure they will be improved upon over time
---
I was deep in the chronojail until recently, still haven't forgiven taking away the boonshare. It was so fun when I could just... use most of my skills like I usually do anyway, but without worrying that people are running around like headless chickens, so I won't be able to get everyone in the wells, so no boons for them... I do have some hope after the new group quickness on shatters, but well.

---
All those who cared about wvw, raids, fractals, pvp and expansions already quit buddy.
---
Perhaps they're angry because they were expecting these templates to either work similarly to ArcDPS's system, or how GW1 handled build templates and not the aggressively monetized and pretty gimped system ANet is putting out.
---
This image is clearly fake, there are no polearms in the game.
---
Shame on you!

And I love being a sinner

Same answer as before. The first commentator asked why someone would message and then block. Replace "insult" with "talk shit" if it helps you.
---
I'm a returning player, haven't played the game for like 4-5 years, and I don't remember anything at all. I am having a lot of fun despite not owning the expansions.
---
When the condi swap sigils were stronger I was a huge fan of shortbow/shortbow soulbeast, but it was as much for the meme-ability of being "SB/SB SB" and dual-wielding The Dreamer as it was about the validity of the build itself. When I dusted off my condi sb set for a new toon recently, I warmed up (lol) to dagger/torch just to have some diversity in my damage options.
---
It's our favourite pastime.
---
EXCUSE ME WHAT
---
I THINK THIS WILL IMPACT SUPPORT DRUID?
---
It's less that they do monetize those features, and more that this is basically double-dipping into the inconvenience to make everyone pay that much more.
---
Tmute charges, bank tabs, storage expanders, and other character tabs aren't double-dipping this hard.  Bag slots are like, the one other thing that are this terrible.
---
Everyone should check this one out, thanks for posting!
---
Yeah I know that feel...
---
I was saving up to make 7 runes and 10 sigils for my ele (who has all legendaries possible already) but now I'm just sitting on a pile of gold and resources/prov tokens hoping that build templates change for the better soon :V
---
blue won; everyone knows that the team with more guardians wins
---
though it's stronghold so who knows
---
Your F skills now only activate around you if you have no shades and only activate around your shades if any are up. Not both.
---
Do you have any evidence to support your theory it was bugged/not working as intended?
---
As far as i can tell ANET have never said it was a broken mechanic, even looking at how the spec is described shows that it was working as intended, using shades skills near and far.
---
It’s all already happened.
---
We’re in the endgame now.
---
I have never been able to see the codes either, on PC myself, but since i use TACO i can "crack it" easily. It always starts with 1 (or at least teh days i tried).
---
At least Chris Cleary got demoted as security leader after this
---
I mean...that's what you do? Those skills usually have a high cooldown and/ a self CC/Animation Lock? There are a lot of examples outside of GW2 that are "avoid danger and still burst you down" skills (DotA2 Phoenix Ult, LoL Leblanc as a whole, FFXIV ranger has a jump evade are examples on the top of my head). You dont shout at an open stove just because it burnt you when you touched it, you shout because you voluntarily put yourself in danger. You avoid the danger or avoid situations that put you in that position
---
Atm skyscale food cost 1.82g to craft, instasell is 3.77 after fee profit is 1.38g per charged quartz posting at 4,07g (best offer) net you 1.63g, not as cheap as other options, sure but not the 3g profit either.
---
I literally paid for 6 copies of the game for my friends and none of them play now... only 1 showed real interest but was having multiple issues with the game blackscreening... once again I am alone with no friends
---
EDIT: I spend hours playing with them and teaching them the game were I could. Now they mainly play destiny 2 and wow classic.
---
We are now either healbot or switching to condi lmao
---
I def can't see the weapons
---
woulda made more sense to convert them to something like grow lamp to sell and then buy cheaper stuff for prov tokens but you do you
---
No, because everyone clearly thinks so. Every argument you said was either wrong or misinformed and you've been told multiple times by everyone else as to why.
---
Imagine grinding for your first legendary, something like incinerator, and then just not being able to see it.
---
AMR!!!
---
And how often do you craft leges? By the time I finish another one I have extra stack. I capped my banks at 2k obsi now and I am crafting one after another. I am more worried that there is not enough obsidian sinks
---
Fire Legion horn would be awesome!!
---
fuck you moron. they had an agreement. everyone knew this was coming. stop your fucking fake outrage, hater.
---
and exactly because this is a 3rd party program, they had this agreement.
---
When will the expansions go on sale I've been waiting months for them to go on sale :(
---
Same here.  My main was Chrono but haven't bothered to go back to it since the major nerfs.  Plus I was enjoying my new scourge build so much...
---
Yooo that's really bad... I usually position myself so that it makes 4 shades including my character for max AoE this nerf is real bad...
---
No, we need to go to the day of pirate gear and ele only content /s
---
If you already have the charged quartz, you just need 5 globs, that basically costs 1g, meat is very cheap, and even if prices arent that high today, i've sold food for 4.70g each day for a couple of months, but even with 4, minus the 1 for globs, it's a 3g profit..
---
I mean, my math was stupid, but that's what i meant, it's a gain even buying quartz (i get them going to drytop with alts tho)
---
What happened was ArenaNet just occasionally glances at feedback and then gets too distracted with the gemshop and forgets to do actual balance changes.
---
This is one of the reasons people think Anet doesn't give a toss about PvP. This has been an issue for years at this point &amp; they do nothing.   
---
What makes it infuriating is it's an easy fix
---
You need install reshade, like always. After overwrite with this ddl orginal reshade dll (that You gave in bin64 folder). It's working.

---
so you're telling me you need to do more than press 1 to do fractal 1 with 5 meta builds? I feel sorry for you if that challenges your abilities.    
---
There's hard content in pve you're right. But the majority of it is just pressing 1 including fractals up to the higher levels,most dungeon paths and pretty much all open world events.  
---
The only thing cringe worthy here is your condescension

That's better than me I¨ve made 3 wrong gifts before I've noticed:-D

GW3 won't happen. Ever. It's fate was sealed the moment the cash shop became the main focus of GW2. It will be milked until it's dry and then they'll make a GW mobile game to milk the IP a bit more.

It's just gonna be a bot fest again. Archeage was a great idea that died the Korean death

    Destiny 2: Forsaken is a major expansion for Destiny 2 because it basically contains 80% of the game's content. Definitely recommend.

I just felt a little bit of my soul die reading that
---
That's mostly PR talk... But really, skill and traits are stored into a database. True, the engine might provide some functionality to connect both the game and the database, either via an API or just directly connecting to it. But it still does not mean the engine is at fault here.
---
I was kinda surprised when they showed of Build Templates. It looks better then I expected and it has a lot more functionalities than I expected. They even said on stream they're looking into a way of linking build templates with gear templates so you can press one key to load both at the same time, which is amazing! They also said this is not an outfit template, but are eager to work on that in the future. And all people do is complain about the amount of slots/tab, while it's not even released and no one got to experience it. Who knows, they might increase the free slots we get, or maybe they won't. But can we agree on the fact that we get some free slots, while they could've just made this a buy to have feature instead of free for everyone with extra slots to buy if you need them? It was never said build templates would come as a free feature...
---
Don't get me wrong. I would love to have more for free, but without a sub free en LW episodes being free at release, the gem store is their only sustainable income. I'm happy there's no sub fee in this game, and I can come and go whenever I want and don't have to feel forced to play because I payed a sub.
---
Who else wants "Tyrian Badass" template on their list?
---
16th century German. The clothing is clearly landsknecht, and as a landsknecht fan I upvoted for that reason alone. :-D
---
Ah, I assumed you meant the latest expansion.
---
Oh I see!
---
So you mean specifically when like speed-levelling characters, and you get tons of rewards without any way of just receiving them all at the end! 
---
Yeah that sounds pretty tedious. Thanks for explaining. :)
---
They did something. They made a poll about character locks after the queue is concluded, but people voted no. So players chose that fate on themselves.
---
It’s all good bud. But yea it just accumulated over time man. A lot of these people have no real use for it so it just stacks up. Also, you gotta keep in mind some of them have been playing for quite a few months or even years at this point.
---
Basically, Dragonfall have 3 lanes (Forest,Fire,Mist) you will have to upgrade lanes to level 4 by complete the events (rewards you with Mistborn Key) and then begin the META. 
---
When the meta started, you will run around center of the map try to destroy weak points and some champ. 3 boss will appear after that, you need to finish it almost at the same time.
---
There are many chests spawn in the meta but you will need the Key to open. No key no loot ;)
---
One for each profession, i'm a hopeless altoholic, so much so that i've been playing from release day and still don't have a main, so 9 seemed like a fair compromise. :P
---
Luckily i never had to juggle so many builds on one character to consider making even more alts. ;)
---
This is not bad, but some farms like the mai trin boss are around 50g/h...sure it's repetitive but the difference in coin is staggering. I wound up with 210g after 3 hours and 45 minutes of mai trin the other day

In theory, I agree with you, but in practice... eh, most mobile games that are worth the price tags are ports.

My cook did it without questing. Just crafting and discovering stuff. At 500 I did one story piece at rata sum city to get that ascended -10%dmg power/ferocity feast recipy. That is all I cared about.
---
Why was the last update necessary? I logged into my ranger, can't throw a GS anymore and sword skills are all mixed up. 6 years of muscle memory, poof.
---
Yep, i just login for daily rewards now ,and to do story once a century when update finally comes out.
---
Right now, the less necro you have, the better your odds of winnign a PvP game are.
---
I mean, if you say that to everyone it can be considered abuse but only once it shouldnt be.
---
I hate having to click on the floating icon and then move the mouse to click on accept and then back. When you're spamming the tomes you can line the windows up so you don't have to move the mouse at least during that point.
---
Yes they did, it was 3rd ERP and they promoted 1st and 2nd.
---
Me: Okay I'll just play another game.
---
No reason to have any faith in Anet anymore.
---
Honestly, GW2 feels pretty dated at this point.

“*We want Scrapper to have more support and utility, so we're going to take away one of Scrapper's support and utility skills then replace it with a utility skill that is only useful in one game mode. Also here's some tiny damage and cooldown buffs because what this support class really needs is more dps.*
---
*These changes are entirely designed around WVW, and they will be applied to all game modes.*
---
*Now that we've increased Scrappers value in WVW, we are also nerfing the rune of Antitoxin so Scrapper won't be as good in WVW anymore.*”

This one was long overdue, smölhart is a necromancer now so this is all old news really.

---
I think you're misunderstanding my post. I'm talking about competitive formats here. If I get a mesmer pop out of stealth next to me in PVP and I survive the initial burst, I should be able to counter-attack, forcing them onto the defensive. Not the case in the current iteration of the game. Mesmers can and will keep aggressing you while being completely invulnerable for almost the whole fight. You're telling me to avoid getting into combat with a mesmer or try to wait for him to exhaust all his CDs by killing my teammate; all while he can stealth and port across the map.
---
When you have equipment tabs being limited to 6 and the people who actually need this system need more than 6 tabs generally, you’ve designed a system that doesn’t even fulfill its intended purpose. That doesn’t even touch on the monetization issues or other functionality issues.
---
I’m Originally from South Africa but immigrated to the USA 6 years ago.If I was still living over there I could barely afford the game just for myself I feel your pain.
---
I wasn't being anal, just being honest.  Once you're playing end game content for a decent chunk of time your karma will pile up (probably faster than you can use it).  It's the way of the currency in the game.
---
You can only do it on one character, right? I did it on a character I hardly play anymore. Am I just fucked if I want 500 cooking on another char?

Our only saving grace were the spirits and now we are garbo now LMAOOOOO

Time to learn how to play SB then
---
How long do you need to wait between runs of a dungeon like Twilight Arbor before the bosses drop chests again?
---
&gt; and then they'll make a GW mobile game
---
By that time phones will just be able to run GW2 native.
---
Wow this just keeps getting worse and worse lmao
---
To be fair, what constructive answer were you possibly hoping to get out of such a question?
---
This is why I don't report exploits anymore. I used to be a goody 2-shoes myself until I got banned for a week over an exploit I'd found. I forgot which game it was. That was like 15years ago. Needless to say, I learned my lesson to never trust a business.
---
I have a [general guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Start_Here) if you're interested as well as some [other guides linked at the top](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide). But you are already doing a lot of the suggestions with building berserker stats (power, precision, ferocity), using shortbow swap for mobility, doing events, etc. Main thing I'd say is just don't feel like you have to do hearts, some people see them as quests to tick off and get board when they should be seen as optional progress you get for sticking around in a zone. 
---
For black lion chests you can open them whenever you like what is in them, the bonus contents change about every month (new weapon skins, rare unlocks, super rares can shuffle around). Exp boosts it's up to you how fast you want to level, feel free to use them now or save them. The other boosts you get (magic find, item boosters, etc) I'd suggest saving though you can use the crafting booster if you decide to do some [crafting](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Crafting_2).
---
Oh and if you do get the expansions DLGamer (an [official retailer](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/)) has them [on sale for $20](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807) (buying PoF includes HoT for free). Also if you're on NA and get the expansions I can get you a mount early to help with getting around (if you're interested, otherwise you get the account unlock through a level 80 story mission).
---
I glad I manage to buy it at the time. If guild Wars 3 launches today I would need to save money for a year to buy it.
---
No you are just paying for PoF HoT is just free its not included in the price of the expansion.
---
I've settled by having pretty much every gender/race/armor weight that I care about.
---
I also have 6 humans, 1 for each god. 4 norn, one for each spirit of the wild. 4 sylvari, one for each cycle. 4 charr, one for each legion (including flame) and 3 asura, one for each college. :D
---
if you want free entertainment go play free to play games
---
What's that farm?
---
What you "got for it" was playing the game for a year.
---
Like, in another 7 years?
---
The daily bonus chest of 80 tokens is per path per day, otherwise you still get the base 20 tokens. Daily reset is at 00:00 UTC (5pm PDT, 8PM EDT). You can check time in game or you can open your achievements tab which will have a countdown for daily reset.
---
People are bored and instead of finding a fresh game, they come to Reddit and feast with the other roaches.
---
Are you forgetting about all the krait weapon variants you can turn in? One or more in each tab goes for like 50-60s with the exception of one tab that accepts apothecary weapons and another that only takes bringer or something. I would describe that as comparable.
---
Fractal 42. 3 pDPS, one of which is dragonhunter or reaper for the massive pull, and a firebrigade. You can consistently complete the scale in under 3 minutes with practice and a competent team. It is great for farming relics as well.
---
How did you determine the so called majority?
---
The Problem with the PvP community is, that seemingly 1 in 10 players is an asshole who starts flaming in the map chat – usually one of the worst performing players in the game who blames others for not carrying him correctly.
---
And because a game consists of 10 players you get roughly one asshole per game.
---
Sometimes I get, why people are flaming in ranked games, because you can expect your team to perform at roughly the same skill level as you.
---
But flaming in unranked games, where you should expect new players or players that are just there for the daily, this flaming is just stupid. If you see someone flaming in unranked, just counter with: "go play ranked"
---
On the other hand, there are mostly very nice, but sadly less vocal people in PvP.
---
Just think about it that way: if he got time to type in map chat, he probably is incapable of using the keystrokes towards winning.
---
When I was new to ranked games, I once got nice and helpful tipps from an enemy player after the game, who was playing the same build as I but ripped me apart multiple times during the game without a problem.
---
When they decided to rework spirits for some reason.
---
I miss Blingg :(
---
That’s a weird way to spell “elf”
---
They all have decent options though I guess I'd lean more towards guardian in general and warrior with axes (or real cleave AoE with the condi build)

&gt; What happened?

Some players lost their PvP advantages over other players
---
I'd love context on this sometime since this is one bit of info i am not aware of
---
Thank you. I stopped watching the video the moment I heard "It's the same engine, it should be already there." Because that's just not how coding works.
---
Digital Extremes would like a word.
---
Build bunker heal brand, or dead eye permanent stealth.
---
Big Fan to sam
---
I have 18 characters.. only 5 are asura.
---
Good to know. I'm a bit fan of aoe classes, but I prefer melee and they always tend to feel like they have fewer options.
---
I'm probably going to keep it up with a Guardian for now but I may look into a Revenant as well later. You've given me a lot of info and it should really help, so seriously, thanks.
---
I haven't played S2 in ages but always thought it was much better then personal story. That said the story does get better later on. Later seasons/expansions go up in quality too. At least that's my opinion.
---
Raids, achievements, raid training, helping others, new story and maps when they show up, guild missions and playing with friends.
---
That’s perfectly fine man. Don’t worry, karma is always available. And yea man,  the real beauty of this game is that it’s so open in terms of what you can do rather than what you have to do. So many other games the gear treadmill or progression is just never-ending that the game just turns into World of Gearcraft. I dunno if it’s just me but I end up caring so much more about the lore, the world, and the experience when I’m not just trying to get the next piece of gear to be even somewhat competitive. (That being said,I’m a total casual.) Man ha, I’m sure some people could hit me with a counter-argument about it and what not but this game has been one of the only games in the last decade that has grabbed my attention and pulled me into the world to this extent.  Sorry for my rant. Good luck my friend.
---
You are talking about contracts that force players to accept how these build templates will be monetized. Nothing like that exists. The players are free to choose if they want to buy them, or not, and are free to protest if they think it's wrongly implemented.
---
Also I'm not angry at playing the game, just saying just because you can pay with in-game gold does not make it free. You are using your own personal time, which not everyone has an infinite amount of.
---
Answered every question.
---
&gt;I know there was a brief explanation in the recap but still, it's quite a shock how close they're supposed to be for my character. The story assumes I know them very well and it's quite jarring. 
---
Reintegrating the story from Season 1 should become a priority for them.
---
&gt;Also what's up with these two lesbian characters that I'm forced to third wheel with? 
---
They're Kas and Jory. No video game ever made does relationships in a non-cringy, cliched way so try to deal with it.
---
Idk, I'm not sure I like looking forward to things that will come out, idk, late next year.
---
I'm mostly kidding, but that Duviri trailer, I really want to play that *right now*.
---
He is clearly saying the relationship and dialogues between those two and his character is cringy and cliche which means it's poorly written. It doesn't look like homophobia to me. People get super defensive when they see anything about these sensitive topics even without reading or trying to understand what that actually means.
---
"He is saying something about LGBT community BOOOO BURN HIM! Wait, what was he saying again?"
---
Welcome to 2019 man. What a time to be alive.
---
The templates we are getting *are* decent, they just aren't great or free. It should be enough to maintain the majority of raiders, since the minmax 20 templates is required for speedruns, not completion.
---
thank you :D
---
Haven't done raids in quite a long time, could you elaborate? Scourge was fine in the state it was in?
---
From Path of Fire onwards it gets really better
---
Also this is not the game you wanna play if you sincerely wrote "What's with these lesbians I'm forced to hang with?" as a legitimate complain
---
You have to cast the spirits for boons, which is less dps or healing than before. The uptimes of the boons are also lower for the extra work, and stability is almost nonexistent now with the high cooldown of spirit of nature. To make it worse, spirits still keep their clunky casting animations making it hard to use reactively, and allies have to be in range when they do finish casting rather than giving boons when you go in and out of the zones.
---
It’s almost entirely more clunky than before, but anet forces us to use 3-5 of these clunky spirits cause they took away other options like glyph of empowerment.
---
Wow shows how much I pay attention. I took that chnage all wrong since I swapped to mostly HB right around that time. Yikes!
---
If I didn't know better from your other posts, I would accuse you of being a Bungie shill.
---
&gt; Also what's up with these two lesbian characters that I'm forced to third wheel with?
---
Why am I forced to cringe through straight Jenna and furry Logan's non, one sided love story?
---
don't you need to be fractal god for it to be as profitable as you make it sound?
---
did you play scourge for the minimal APM or for the damage role?
---
since reaper isn't your thing try rev.
---
i once had a full team of thieves/daredevils/deadeyes
---
I dunno if I'll ever forgive them for removing boonshare from Chrono.  I think one of the big reasons I liked Chrono was because it was less about hitting enemies with sticks and more about hitting allies with sticks so they can hit enemies with sticks harder.  Iirc back when phantasms shared their boons, your goal was to get boons onto phantasms along with allies because your phantasms would effectively act as boon multipliers.  I still haven't figured out just how much of a boon multiplier they were due to the description being a little wonky (if for N phantasms w/ x stacks of alacrity, if you'd get N*x stacks of alacrity back, or N stacks of alacrity).  Either way though, for me it was far more enjoyable.  Now it just feels like the spec focuses on beating things with sticks while occasionally using wells and SoI to extend your boons on allies.
---
You need to do the collection to unlock the composter and garden plot (to plant varietal herbs if I remember correctly) but once you do that - those can be (or are in the case of the plot will be automatically) shared across multiple characters (put the composter into a shared inventory slot and the plot should appear in other character's home instances).
---
If you want to level other characters to 500 chef - just use discoveries and crafting like you would to get to 400. You can then use the plot and/or composter to craft Ascended food on that character as well.
---
The Cooking station in the home instance is available for the other character as well once you reach 425 Chef and give one of the chef's a rare food plate but the character which completed the collection is the only one able to get the Bloodstone version (your other character will be left with a normal cooking station).
---
Not at all! It doesnt affect the speed much, though one fractal god i did a farm with had burst damage in excess of 150K/s on the beginning mobs so if everyone was a fractal god it would likely reduce your time for completing the scale.
---
Personally, I don't even have mist attunement one unlocked. Yet.
---
I'm not entirely sure what you're on about. You seem to be talking to a ghost that said a whole lot more than me.
---
How in gods name do they need more than six different armour configurations for a single character? I suppose under the rare chance they happen to be both an active pvp and pve player then its less fair, but damn man - the fuck.
---
Two armour configurations and three spec slots per character at a base seems pretty fair to me, it covers both my main and Chrono immediately for both their alternate sets and frankly as of right now is just a bonus for other characters, as their roles are so simple and or specific that build templates aren't even required. 
---
I'm sorry, but this feature does benefit me, is intended for players like myself and I don't have a problem with how it works or how it's monitized.
---
I'll raise you 9 female Norn.....I got my reasons
---
Lol I think you live in an alternative reality.
---
Up to you what you want to do.  GW1 still doesn't have equipment templates in PvE.
---
In what world is detection pulse not useful in PvP? Do you not have thieves on the enemy team? Or engineers using toss elixir to stealth the whole team on the opening fight? Use your brain, man. The idea that detection pulse is only useful in WvW is idiotic.
---
You know what's worse? Deleting an ascended item by mistake while deleting all the other shit.
---
I don't know, I just know it's a question worth asking. In my case, the current system does make it a bit more worth it for me to craft legendary armor, because the armory solves the problem of having to carry every other piece of gear required for a different build.
---
&gt; Much of the work they did wasn't saved
---
That is probably some sort of misunderstanding because doing game development without some sort of version control system seems insane. 
---
I think it was mentioned at some point that they use Perforce for that so the stuff should still be around. That being said it might not help much since diving into old code that works with old versions of other code might take more work than rewriting from scratch.
---
The open world stuff is probably not resusable regardless of the state of the code if the goal is something more like LS2,3,4,5.
---
The value of making those can probably be easily estimated from how many people buy the LS2,3,4 episodes.
---
It doesnt need to be on steam, it has it's own launcher. It's not like it uses epic launcher, why would you want it to be on steam when you can play steam games on your screen while nothing is going on on gw2 on your second screen.
---
There is no truth to be had without the data from Anet. LOL.
---
I already told you weeks ago that trying to get the last word in doesn't make you right.  You are slow.  And desperate to rationalize anything to try to be right; going first from saying you don't need data, to then claiming you are using data, to then excluding data again.

This is the nicest way I've ever heard "there's no class that lets you get away with so much lazy play" phrased.
