I will definitely save the gear I have! I worked for that :)

---
I think I will keep your offer in mind, though I am playing in EU and I dont know how servers and all that work nowadays

---
I am way faster clicking than using keybinds. It has been like that for years. My muscles aren't what they used to, but my reflexes are.  
---
  
---
Edit: 7:30 - that was great bomb/balls timing.
---
Springer is still my favourite. I love how it moves and jumps.
---
Top players already have a direct method to communicate with devs through discord.
---
Tried a mouse with customable side buttons? Don't need to have everything on the keyboard when you have everything on 1 finger
---
Because it is a box with a sky on it, like most games. Just.. not very well made.
---
I really can't reconcile YouTube Teapot and Twitch Teapot... so much praising things on YT, always salt on Twitch to the point I can't even watch!
---
DAE get super dizzy when they hold their breath really long?

With GW2, it’s usually best to go in without too many assumptions. Best to just say to go in fresh and expect new things. The game is very different from other MMOs, so don’t be afraid to explore and enjoy the journey for what it is. 
---
The real game starts at level 80, but take your time getting there- don’t rush. Leveling is the best way to learn your class and the game. Along the way, make sure to try out all that the game has to offer- PvP, WvW, fractals, raids, expansions, etc.
---
If you are ever stuck check the GW2 wiki before asking on here or in game. Have fun!
---
I have a net that would like to talk to you.
---
Ah, thanks for the info. I'll pass then. I'm not going to reply to everyone, but I really appreciate all the opinions!
---
Anyone can tank really, just need to be able to avoid or heal the damage. Viable tanks don't just include boon chrono but also heal firebrand, heal druid, even DPS like condi renegade and condi firebrand or hybrid DPS like alacrity renegade or boon thief. Really the idea is that someone that doesn't lose out much if they tank does it and still does their main job be that healing, boons, DPS, or a combo of them. Heal scrapper can tank anything no problem especially in tanky gear but heal scrapper provides 0 DPS, 0 useful boons, and 0 Group damage. The biggest thing it brings is condition conversion but many other healers can just cleanse (no need to convert) and the boss boon corruption is very limited and mostly avoidable.
---
It's still over there if you want to go back.
---
I'm usually the last person to fall in any group so I have good sustainability, but the damage just isn't there. I'm running full viper's gear and weapons. (scepter + dagger or greatsword / staff, depending on the situation)  
---
I'm not at home, so I can't really look at my traits, but I think I'm running spite and curse.
---
That is inaccurate, what I said it this video is a compressed version of what I said on stream.
---
lol It is very slow, which is why I stop playing it almost days after I start, the gameplay is so dated I dont get why WoW classic is so popular
---
You have no idea how immesivelly happy I'm right now about this. I dont expect instant changes, and we are probably about to embark on a wild ride of meta shifting as outliers get nailed down and previously oppressed builds can resurface/be created.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As a PvP advocate (seriously, read my post history! also: [https://i.imgur.com/tOtYjXw.png](https://i.imgur.com/tOtYjXw.png), playing since beta, still havent gotten bored, but playing ele for 7 years through most metas has been a **VERY** painful thing since other than that short time of cele D/D and the now condi weaver, we have always been B-C tier at best, Z at worst) this kind of posts help a lot reinvigorate the mode for new and veteran players alike :D
---
Based on the way they currently do skill splits even if they have more control / can do more splits it won't really make a big difference. They basically fiddle with the numbers (damage, durations, cooldowns, etc) and that is pretty much it, that won't change that much, because many of the balance problems are down to the the fundamental design of classes, weapons, etc.
---
For example, Scourge often makes up 14-20 spots in a 50 man squad, which in any well run game would be considered obscenely imbalanced, 1 class out of 9 taking up to 40% of the spots. The problem is you can't really fix them just by nerfing the numbers on their skills, because the issue is they can simply do way too much at once, boon corrupt, damage both ranged / melee AOE, support with cleanses, barrier, and so on. 
---
Same thing from the other end with something like Ranger, in zergs the pet is useless, too reliant projectiles, their weapon choices are mostly terrible for zergs and so on. Again changing numbers won't alter that much or address the actual issues.
---
So unless these splits allow them to do more than simply alter numbers, then not much will really change.
---
The way you said it, it was unclear.
---
I actually think it's good to have other gameplay mechanics than just fights. What would be great is combining both JP and fights.
---
Side buttons helped me hugely with kit/condi engi. Kits on mouse, 1-5 on keyboard. It makes it both mechanically easier and also somehow mentally simpler, to have one hand "shifting gears" and the other casting spells.
---
Steve never bothered to finish me off, so I’m basically 3-1 on him.
---
[removed]
---
I’d be happy if TaCo went away. It cheapens gameplay.  It’s ultra lazy mode in my likely unpopular opinion.  But use of it is optional, and nobody’s use of it affects my choice not to use it anymore. So, it should not be against tos and should not go away.
---
The bomb opens the bigger chest at the end.  Explodes if you get hit by a gryphon.
---
That's a good point, but if those protesters are still playing, they won't save the game, they will cause an unpopulated game, more layoffs and  more money grabbing techniques to milk the remaining whales
---
Keep a stunbreak on hand and steve should never kill you.
---
Don't disagree that they should take feedback, but I do want to set the record straight on those posts. 
---
They don't ask for feedback on them. If you look they say it is a preview and it is there for the community to start theory crafting.
---
A week or two before patch day is not enough time to redo tons of things in a balance patch so people should never expect that quick of a turn around.
---
Hopefully going forward they will be trying to share ideas early enough to act on feedback instead of just previewing.
---
I salvage everything. All the time. Lol. At like around 1500 hrs across all chars
---
Yeah, being able to like ctrl+click pieces then make the change would be cool, but it's fairly niche and may not work with the way their interface is coded, so I get why they may not put resources on it.
---
then play reaper instead of core necro? like what's the problem?
---
Can we have an engine team looking into increasing performance?
---
Ive wanted to play the original for a while, is it as good as 2?
---
Cousin's half-sister through the parent you're not biologically related to.
---
I honestly think the ship sailed on this at launch.
---
Too much rests on the foundation that was put in that way, and they're not likely to go tearing that up now.
---
Charr concept art vs Now 
---
:-(
---
First one looks like GW1 more than GW2
---
Been gone for some time. What happened to Dulfy? Used to be the go to place for walkthroughs and guides
---
BGDM's gear check was removed because anet was specific that they didn't want the feature at that time, not because of how it did it. I'd assume any new gear check feature would be enabled for PvE only where there is no competitive advantage to be gained.
---
Chrono is out of meta, go banner
---
I just want them to put good platforming mechanics if they want to do jumping puzzles in MMOs.
---
2 b fair we need more things like these
---
Seconding banner. It's an irreplaceable support class.
---
Chrono on the other hand has fallen out of favor for the hybrid heal/power quickbrand + power/heal renegade setup.
---
Probably more like 400...that said I guess that they just want to try to monetize this kind of stuff as much as possible since they need to properly fund the Icebrood saga.  
---
After all it seems like they want to push the game toward releasing content more for free instead of selling xpacs...so I guess it's normal that they try to monetize from this kind of stuff. Since the only other option is going the p2w way.
---
She got busy and is taking a break. I'd suggest checking out the wiki, it's got a lot of information and guides.
---
Oh god, I am a launch player and all I can say pvp has never been right.
---
Penalize zerging. Any time there is more than 10 allied players within 5000 range, all player attributes get reduced by the same percentage as the number of allied players(capped at 75% reduction) . Imagine a 50+ person zerg with half health and half power. 
---
Once every one goes in small teams, skills would be easier to balance because gameplay is dynamic. Bot type builds will die because you need real skill to survive instead of just spamming.
---
Support chrono is meh to "ew, bad" in fractals these days. If you really want support either go alacrity renegade or heal firebrand (until that one gets nuked from high orbit in a few more "balance" patches)
---
&gt; A disadvantage of Deceptive Evasion is, that newly created clones from deceptive evasion don't use the ambush skill right after getting summoned.
---
It does for me. I use it in my staff/staff build all the time.
---
my friend mains BS and beats all our pugs 95% of the time in DPS, and we always joke about him playing "support class btw"
---
They gave tits to the bull skyscale though. It even has the jiggle physics turned on.
---
I haven't used that in years. It never proc'd so I quit using it.
---
anets stance on memory injection explicitly states in the TOS that youre not allowed to do it "without signed written consent from a legally authorized representative of ArenaNet " (this actually is the case for ALL mods) Basically clearly gave permission to use it for combat data only NOT including buffs and things like that.. and that was it. Gear checks and the floating health bar were not a part of that and therefor were, and as far as I know still are.. against the ToS.
---
From a statistical standpoint, your sample data is too small. You would need to run many more hours and average over that to get a more accurate count.
---
Tbh? Microtransactions aren't the problem, but anet didn't care about gvg or, believe it or not (its the first time now after 7 years that we have a "competitive skill guy") reasonable balancing. Its not what you want it to be I guess. Everything is hack and slay...
---
Froggie mount for swimming?
---
I'm probably not even going to use them, to be honest. The game already spent 10 years teaching us to live without them, so I've already gotten used to it.
---
Personally I don’t think you should ever be able to stack enough condis onto someone in a short amount of time/effort that even with all their best cleansing abilities they come out with severe condis after blowing all their defenses or going completely in as a last resort. Especially when you’d keep stacking them on after that.
---
Additionally, no class should be able to one shot without retribution. We need some kind of shield ability that you can trade off an important ability (heal?) which prevents you from getting rekt by an invisible foe popping out behind you. Something that severely lowers damage for 1-2 seconds after getting hit without having to reflexively activate it (a passive).
---
The word count of a post has very little correlation to whether or not the post is informed or intelligent. You could write a 5,000 word essay on balance, but if you have no idea what you're talking about it's still a useless post.
---
I usually get tripped up on it, but I've never died because of it. I usually die because I wait too long on the long fall. My brain just stops working randomly there.
---
100% this. There are far too many carebears  on the official forum, for any meaningful suggestion not to get quashed on the spot. 
---
Hell Bad Med,  the imbecile still cries for Deleting Mesmer as a class, cuz one touched him inappropriately while he was on his period.
---
Me
---
Only problem is there is only 1 in-game instrument novelty: the Wintersday bell. Everything else is gemstore. They could create little music-box novelties though...
---
The zerg isn't there to take the camp for loot. They're there to take the camp's supply and then take a tower/keep/castle... unless the besieged can muster a defending squad to meet them in the single biggest, most truly multiplayer thrill GW2 has to offer. Kill it and you kill a unique subculture within the game.
---
Yea that's it
---
I sold both sunrise and twilight for around 5k gold and bought eternity for 3.8k-ish gold
---
That's getting you 3 legendary skins, 1 legendary weapon AND 1k gold on top
---
Parasitic contagion doesn't proc. It's constant as long as you are doing condition damage to something your healing for 10% of that damage unless your full health already.
---
These sort of penalties are not the answer.
---
I definitely get it, as I am in the group that got hit hardest by the official templates: I'm a raid-focused chrono main with a TON of different builds and full legendaries.
---
Luckily, ANet announced in the thread I linked that:
---
&gt; We don't have any desire to take punitive action against players who are abiding by the Terms of Service and Code of Conduct while using third-party programs, but we can't declare any third-party program "safe" to use because it would require us to commit to oversight.
---
I plan on installing the "no killswitch" build template dll if official templates don't meet my needs. I'm going to give the official ones a try first, but I'm not optimistic. However, if I can buy my way into functional templates with gems, I'm fine. I recently started selling raids, so gold-&gt;gems is absolutely no issue whatsoever for me.
---
And if the official templates are exceptionally well-implemented (again, I'm not optimistic) then I will spend cash on them to support Anet.
---
1%ers smdh
---
i still don't trust anet to not ban arc template users bc their wording is so vague but i'm of the same position. if official templates don't do it for me i'll risk it and find the modified dll, and if they ban me i go to SWTOR lmao
---
considering how much time the players have to put into acquiring legendary gear, would it not be fair for the devs to put in just that little bit extra effort to make legendaries still worth it??
---
to be fair, arc couldn't change skins on your legendaries, either
---
Gifts of exploration are account bound and unless you build it into a legendary to my knowledge there is no way to sell them.
---
Those are actually good news for a change. I only hope they understand that balance changes must never happen mid season.
---
Each zone you complete has about a 25% chance to give you a black lion key (excluding cities and south sun)
---
&gt;EAnet
---
I see what you did there.
---
Legendaries have always been about aesthetic. The Stat swapping is a nice convenience, and it still does offer some, never having to craft new stat ascended pieces again.
---
Idk, I'm not really for removing a convenience that'll help 99% of players just so those of us with legendaries feel slightly more special with the benefit of that convenience.
---
the game was also not 7 years old back before HoT.  That's important to take into account as well.  And also the lack of meaningful updates to the game mode outside of DBL, new rewards, and Warclaw since HoT
---
*trembles in fear of core necro and reaper being nerfed into oblivion for the crimes of scourge*
---
i remember standing around like an idiot for something to happen that night. we had some good laughs, but eventually I passed out.
---
Either/or, frankly. I'm more focused on the cost differential.
---
Don’t give up! I did all the jumpings in the game (not including volcano nightmare) and clock tower was one of my toughest challenges. However, I practiced for the past two years, succeeded once last year and first tried it this year. When you get the trick, you nail it almost every time. Keep it up!
---
Alacrigade is pretty straightforward and fun, especially using staff 5 to feel like a god of CC. I was scared to try it for the longest time after failing to even gear up a meta chrono before it was finally dropkicked out of the meta, but I shouldn't have been; alacrigade is nowhere near as byzantine. You feel useful and powerful, more wanted than pure DPS, and under less pressure to match some golem benchmark. 
---
Haven't put in much time on BS, but my impression is it's very similar but with more DPS. 
---
Bear in mind that both specs are frequently expected to take care of anomalies and balls in 100CM because they can drop their boosts (banners for BS, Soulcleave for alacrigade) on the group and go. I've seen both expectations (BS and alac) and both types of PUGs act like they've never heard of the other role doing it, so it can be hard to either get practice OR gracefully ask someone else to do it for the sake of a quick smooth run.
---
Updates from the Systems Team: “We exist”
---
/carve
---
Hey!
---
You should make them both! 
---
Chrono
---
Portals, Boons, Dps, Stealth, Pulls, Heals, Blinks, Works in any comp + Everyone will love you
---
BS
---
Super DPS, CC, Permanent might, Banners, Very meta for fractal
---
I dont know which one is easier. I think you would learn them both as long as you're having fun
---
They are both very good characters :)
---
I dunno the cogs of doom around the corner are a little more twisted
---
somebody has to make it first, and they can't really start until the templates update overhauls the system
---
While this is mostly focused around balance.
---
I figure I would mention, what about server stability and the recent lag issues in WvW?
---
They made a big announcement about templates, stream and blog post, 2 weeks ago. Tons of people expressed dissatisfaction and gave lots of reasons and suggestions how to change it, what they would like to see. Yesterday ANet released exactly the same info as 2 weeks before, **asking for feedback**.
---
&gt; help you know if enemy is out of range of your skill before using it
---
the red line under your skill shows you that, and it's a lot more accurate than TacO's rings.
---
Apparently not since you are posting senseless edgy pictures. ‘Art station’ because art is the only thing you can find on this subreddit? Yeah, not like there are thousands of other topics covering all aspects of the game.
---
You know, if you are butthurt you are not getting enough attention (apparently because people like sylvati art instead) and praise with your ‘issues’, just become an artist :P Upvotes guaranteed.
---
A tree frog itzel mount to climb surfaces to spots too high for springer to jump!
---
Being allowed to share 1 set of gear between characters would devalue it even more, since less people would need to make more.
---
Completely agreed. Huge thanks to all the mesmers who helped when this bad boy from hell was released.
---
Even as someone who generally has no trouble with it I agree, the waiting time is obnoxious.
---
I didn't do it until they added the checkpoints :(
---
The usual "workaround" for items not having "consume all" is mouse-wheel down -&gt; click, which isn't against ToS specifically because it maps one human action to just one in-game action. Anything else is on thin ice.
---
This is a lost cause. This will be fixed when the servers finally get shut down.
---
Ah, thiefs. Such mysterious creatures. I remember when one hit me with 20K.
---
I remember the essay prompts back in high school that asked you to tell someone your position and give your reasoning. Both of those things are necessary to make a cohesive point.
---
WvW balance should be considered in 3 sections. I'll not go into specs for the sake of simplicity and instead I'll describe main problems
---
1st: profession balance,
---
When we look at current successful 50 man compositions we'll see Guardians=Necromancers&gt;Revenants&gt;Engineers&gt;Elementalists&gt;Anything in numbers. One should consider the reasons of this and try to increase the usage of non meta raid professions. I'm not saying "everyone should be able to do everything" but "everyone should have a useful and definitive use in a large player count fight.
---
This is the most important part because if we want to see people actually playing the game in a wider period of time, instead of only prime time with their guild mates or trusted veterans. Also every random person who are already in the map and not wanting to queue should be able to have fun. We are playing to have fun and it shouldn't be the otherwise.
---
2st: Map and mechanical gameplay balance,
---
profession balance and mechanical gameplay balance are tied together most of the times in discussions. This is a mistake. For example, we want reflects and aoe ranged blocks because we don't want to instantly die before even being able to engage a melee at least once. This results in most builds shine in ranged combat to fail hard in a raid fight. Either a ranged player should have tools in their traits or gear to mitigate the effect or reflects and blocks should have a percentage in them instead of %100 reflect and block. a ranged skill should still hit but for the %20 of it's normal output. Retaliate would still hurt them and they should be mindful about using their aoe skills. There could be new mechanics, such as player body blocks or impact aoes, which would make positioning more important than stacking in a single pixel. For example "this skill now deals aoe to other targets after initial impact in a very short raidus." balance passes would make things interesting.
---
There are other important issues such as boon generation, boon stripping and boon durations. In my honest opinion we shouldn't be able to stack all the boons on all raid members for %90 to 100 of time. Boon generation and extending their duration was the lazy answer for having support orriented specs back then but it's now a glaring problem. To clarify, for example in 2012 we had guardians, elementalists and warriors as support. We had to blast fire/lightning fields to have enough time for bursting damage and mobility and timing was crucial because blasting means we had to use our skills and they'd be on cool down as we focus doing it, enemy could rush on us and catch off guard if we were not fast enough. We can still do it but it doesn't benefit as much since we could just play a revenant, a guardian and a necromancer in a team and call it day now. As I said before, players are like liquids and players will go to wherever with least friction.
---
As maps, there are not enough wall blocks around the world. There aren't enough ambush points to catch enemy zergs offguard. There are no *Plays of the Week* type of fights that requires insane strategy to win. There are not enough interesting terrains around. Obunaga won Okehazama War in 1560 against 1:10 odds just because the terrain. While large and flat areas are cool too, it really forces certain profession compositions to be what they are now. "If we can't avoid a bomb with LOS, if we can't hide without a veil, then we'll just use the target limit and stack on each other and pray to rngesus to not get corrupted to deepest parts of the mists in the first push" is not a fun mentality. I have something like 1/50 changes to die in first 5 seconds and I roll a dice again every next second. Fight either ends in ten seconds because people dying increase logarithmical or losing group scatters around like headless chickens because the one first died was the commander. To avoid this and having an illusion of fun, we pirate ship instead and hope to catch or pull some clueless bad players in between before the actual push, then again if *that* player was the commander... you got the point.
---
3rd: Rewards. It's self explanatory. I don't care about gold per hour, most of us don't, but I'd love to have better/faster/cheaper ways to get ascended gear and exclusive, cool skins to the game mod.
---
Sometimes I literally log in just to fly around with Skyscale. Nothing else. And I love it.  
---
Thanks to the devs for making it happen &lt;3
---
&gt; ...things below 250 ess are pretty chill on NA for the most part so long as people aren't horribad.
---
So true. Everyone is just there to get dailies done with as little headache and time spent waiting as possible.
---
Agreed. They have several game modes waiting in the wings that are just unused. 2v2, team deathmatch, stronghold, etc. Without these game modes, many skills that would find use elsewhere (IE WvW) fail to deliver.
---
I agree with you. I think Deadeye is a bad design choice and the game is probably better off without it.
---
Having said that, you screw up more than once in that clip.
---
I think you are right. There was/is an item for which this works, but I also cannot remember the heck which that was/is.
---
&gt; GW2 ~~PvE~~Raids
---
maybe
---
Ah, did not know that.
---
Same. In the end a friend did it once for me last year so I could get the achievement.
---
Delicate timed movement in game in just not my strong suit, it's also why I suck with the roller beetle, haha. It's just that with most JPs timing is less of an issue and the position rewinder helps a lot.
---
At the same time, they nerfed most other condition specs to oblivion despite condi specs having obvious drawbacks, so most fights now favor power builds....
---
What's more, they need to nerf the extra damage taken bullshit on breakbar. Just make breakbars proper interrupt phases where you interrupt key skills that would wipe the group or cause significant stress instead of it just being a free way for high burst power specs to completely skip boss phases.
---
This is why condi specs can't even exist in fractals, and it should be fixed.
---
Power revenant has been absolute garbage since they gutted it with nerfs courtesy of PvP during HoT beta.
---
They should have completely reverted the autoattack damage nerfs, the UA damage and cd nerfs, and implement some serious banner like effects on the glint aspects since clearly Renegade is far better at providing buffs than Herald has ever been in PvE.
---
People complain about mesmer quickness and alacrity, yet nobody complains about the primacy of banner warrior.
---
Well, they could make it so power herald, scrapper, and reaper could opt to fill a similar niche to banner warrior as alternatives just like they used renegade and firebrand to open up competition for chrono and druid.
---
You can keep track of the wait parts of the different sections by counting turns of the tower. The tower itself is octagonal, so every section of the tower works on an 8/8 timing.
---
I always hated their excuse for not specifically endorsing mods. If they simply provided an explicit API for mods to hook into that had a limited set of actions that could be performed through the API, they wouldn't have to monitor any particular addon, they'd just have to be careful about what they put in that API and tell players they can use anything that only makes mod API calls and does not view or modify game information in any other way like WoW does.
---
Banner is only part of of the support that bs brings. CMs have a lot of breakbars and the cc that bs brings speeds up runs immensely.
---
Nah, their bodies are intact, dead but in good condition. doesn't matter how fast I went they just lay dead by the time my character slips inside. ):
---
We did it just the two of us yesterday, maybe you'll have more luck to find just the one friend for all of 30s.
---
How did i know you was a ranger player before watching the video
---
Thanks!
---
I guess you haven't been near the vertical cog...
---
Guild Wars 1 also had a game shop that sold, among other things, outfits. skill pack unlocks, bank space, and character slots. While I agree that this game is more aggressively monetized that Guild Wars 1, there are probably many people who never spend a dime in the cash shop and play just fine. 
---
And in Guild Wars 1, there wasn't the option to farm cash shop currency by playing the game.
---
You can do the ball solo (note I did on 300 ping). You need to be really fast and use some portals though and the biggest problem is coordinating the last two catches. 
---
You can get all ground and the first step up bounces by using special action key.  You need to aim that first step up really well to get it though. Last two are tricky.
---
Indeed, we haven't ever seen a game getting optimizations or even DX11/12 support years after it got released.
---
I don’t play much, that’s one. (Also I’m a casual player.)
---
I'm not sure, if I should really bother. 
---
This is another PR talk and one way comunication 'Thank you for your feedback - No.' 
---
They did not listen for the most ridicullous changes they proposed, why you believe they would listen now?
---
You used to be a good entertainer and now you act like an entitled baby.
---
Excuse me I only deal in Russian Rubles, how much is basegame
---
I'm coming back to the game after almost two years away. Two questions for now:
---
1) Why are rotation guides telling me to double shatter my Mesmer's clones, specifically to shatter with Cry of Frustration and then immediately follow it with Mind Wrack?
---
2) Will the healing effect from six Superior Runes of Tormenting trigger when my axe clones apply Torment, or only when my Mesmer does?
---
&gt; Condi axe/axe
---
You uh, keeping something from us bud?
---
  0₽ ;)
---
Ah, jackals. At first glance, it just seems like a crappier version of the raptor. Then you realise its ability allows you to move in a constant speed regardless of slope or terrain, and you can change directions as you blink rapidly, and it then you realise its better than a raptor for point to point movement on anything except flat, clear ground or mandatory raptor jumps.
---
I used some wierd 'stun dps' build back in a day when they deleted chrono. It was fun, keeping mobs in perma stun and not getting hit while doing dmg, but I've moved back to my DH for facerolls.
---
I thought this was datascape for a second
---
Me too...
---
you know the griffon is a fast as fuck flyer? faster then regular gliding or flapping around with the skyscale. the griffon is fine. all mounts have a unique usage
---
Basically the same as Staff/Staff but with two axes in the main hands and swapping the off-hands (torch or pistol) with sigil of energy. What you carry in offhand doesn't even matter as long as it has the sigil of energy.
---
You can use Mirrored Axes on it, but I prefer Staff/Staff because of the range.
---
Already sold it.. 
---
I'm sure your lucky day will come too, I hope soon...
---
What balance
---
oh sht didnt know that potion existed!! thanks! and I'm usually ~ 30MF overdlow anyways and dont really need the utility 30%, I can dun that potion at no cost :D
---
&gt; While the Skyscale can freely fly
---
That's something skyscale can't do.
---
I realised, was just making a lame joke lol
---
You should definately learn how to fly better with your griffon then. if u know how u can stay in the air for as long as u want. doesn't need any rework at all. look up on youtube how some people fly with them so u can see for yourself that u still need some practice :)
---
Thank you for this meaningful &amp; constructive feedback.
---
Learn to use Hunter's Shot effectively.  Can proc it on mobs.  
---
Get a smokescale for stealth
---
Avoid Deadeyes.  Never worth your time to fight them.  They're not good at anything but being annoying and wasting your time, so learn how to disengage from them and move on.  Using your own forms of stealth is helpful for that.  Also you could have gone to your tower and saved yourself in there, but chose to go elsewhere instead which lead to your death.
---
Dude, you were outplayed so much, no balance could fix that.
---
Wait the entire key run only takes you 15 minutes? I thought i was doing good at 35 minutes. What race/background do you use?
---
Say that to my friend who had 2 of these drops in a year lol
---
That's hilarious one ;)
---
First: lore in other games or any kind of media does not define the lore in gw2 just because it is different does not mean it is wrong.
---
Second: The Griffon does more then just "glide" it flies faster and flies longer if the environment is suited that is the case with every mount, different mounts are better for different situations. For example the skyscale is a slower but more precise flying while the griffon is faster but harder to control.
---
Third: You probably don't know a a griffin works and or behaves but it is every gold piece worth that it costs and it is easier to get.
---
thats not the same as the restructure / revamp system they announced years ago then mentioned that it took more time / resources than they expected and they abandoned that idea. I might be wrong about how they announced it, but I think they didn't even make an official announcement for it and kinda just posted it on a forum post reply to some other topic. What we got instead was skirmishes and the rewards track.
---
The revamp was supposed to redo the backend/underlying architecture to make it easier / faster to make changes and improvements to WvW in the long run. I would search for it but I think the post was in their old forums. might be able to find something about it on reddit though.
---
Yeah I did... well, 9k gold is more than enough for my needs so I didn't want to look for other options...
---
I went and joined your discord and I still don't know wtf you're organizing lmfao
---
Some people have all the luck.
---
Beat the challenge last night after around an hour of frustrating tries.
---
First time ever playing a jumping puzzle and have to admit, the dopamine hit upon successfully completing it was great.
---
Are there more challenges like this for events and such?
---
Inb4
---
I'll assume you're referring to [condi mirage](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/mirage/condition/) rotation. All shatters trigger [Maim the Disillusioned](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Maim_the_Disillusioned) to apply torment. the second shatter is basically just free damage since mesmer and mirage still trigger shatters on themselves. Also if you get an interrupt you proc [Ineptitude](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ineptitude) for confusion. If you are only doing one shatter it's a DPS loss but not a huge one, there are some single shatter or even only cry shatter rotations that aren't too far off benchmark.
---
You mean Springer. Because this mount is good only for CC Anomaly/Choya.
---
I just perform 2-3 careful jumps there, I jump on that particular brick and just keep going.
---
Don't bother to respond, OP is just a troll. He posted the exact same thing yesterday and was laughed right off of Reddit.
---
Griffon is a beautiful creature to fly. A thing when mastered is just a joy to fly.
---
Skyscale is hell to fly and only used to try look cool or go up somewhere.
---
Last time i checked its worth roughly 18k, but you'd have to trade it outside the tp.
---
6 years. Around 11k hours
---
Still waiting even for my first precursor drop xD let alone an infusion like this
---
But I don't understand for what? The forum is full of feedback for wvw, they just have to read. How should I give feedback on non information announcements? Maybe it's just me. Nice downvotes
---
On it then walk down the other pieces instead of jumping on each
---
Yep all they do is shoot you and run. Maybe try backstab you with close enough to perma stealth.
---
The desired stats might not be ideal however..
---
Game needs a full rebalance of each and every class to wipe out all the power creep and then tone it down even more.
---
Regarding condis, basically boils down to condis  need to stack only duration instead of stacks (exempt could be bleed) and not having cases where someone can drop 5 burns, 10 torments and 3 poisons with one click. All condis need to be toned down to like 10% of what they are now. Poison for example could do much less damage so it is used primarily as heal reduction. Burn could be shorter high damage condi. Torment does no damage if you stand still. Confusion does no damage if you don't cast. And so on...
---
Same case with boons, so it doesn't happen that everyone all the time have all the boons. As condis they need to be more 'precise' and more skill involved when playing them, not just smack 2 buttons and you have all boons for the next 30 seconds.
---
Power? most classes do most damage with spamming one button. And that button has a tendency to one-shot. Good gameplay.
---
And lastly, normalisation is killing class variety. Classes and builds need to feel unique. Now, condi thief can drop torment, confusion, bleed, poison. Why? And why are boons given like candy to random skills on random classes? It just kills the variety and uniqueness.
---
Oof
---
how you can survive like dat when you are playing bad :/
---
i guess ranger needs a nerf.
---
If you time it just right then you catch on it and you can jump over it, which leaves you enough time to reach that black that’s just about to sink by the time you get to it. The tricky part is actually nailing that jump and sticking the landing. The entire rest of the clock tower is super easy in comparison to just trying to make that jump fast enough that you can actually get to the rest of the puzzle before it sinks too far.
---
Spent 4 days grinding the whole achievement. No regret. 
---
Spent a month slowly getting the skyscale. Still doubt my choices to grind those currencies. 
---
Yea, it's cool that you can levitate, and presumably get some good views. So what? I could fly over half the map under 15s and pretend I'm an actual eagle.
---
r/gw2exchange and look for a middleman.
---
He clearly stated he will still play but not as often as before, if you often watch his streams you would know
---
Imagine how much more good it will do to add a SECOND endurance bar on the Griffon. That first 1 flap you get is just so bleh to get going on most surfaces to full utilize the griffon as your favorite mount. That's all I ask, 1 more chicken flap mid air... But nope you all want to tell me it's fine \^-\^
---
It's from Crystal Oasis meta (Casino Blitz) . It came when we killed pinata at the end, it wasn't in any bag
---
Even if there was no limit, the TP tax is just too big. TP Barons exchange everything outside of TP to avoid tax. Something as simple as a pre or a legendary get sold on redit exchange as well.
---
The person that you sold the infusion to is making almost as much profit as you did... :(
---
(People spend thousands of gold just to look shiny, so I don't really get your point)
---
Idk. A fat chicken is much worthwhile than any of the skins on TP. I think you're probably expecting too much, thus disappointed with this birdie.
---
What about the good ol' print screen button?
---
Warrior should run mace almost everywhere in fractals. You can precast tremor for extra CC without losing any time at the beginning of most phases, and most phases don't go on anywhere near long enough the benefit of axe only to matter.
---
Maybe they realized build templates would be easier than 13.5 more expansions
---
Funny thing about this "courtesy of pvp" is that scrapper, reaper and herald are all stupid strong in pvp/wvw. And you want more buffs for them.
---
People complained about druid needing competition in raids, but this exact notion is one of the reasons druid has been completely gutted in pvp/wvw. Druid isn't even that good, in pve it's carried by core ranger party buffs. Firebrand now dominates BOTH gamemodes.
---
Druid needs a complete rework if it's ever gonna compete with support scrapper or firebrand in pvp modes. Just keep Grace of the Land for pve players, it's the only druid trait that matters in pve..
---
Oh I have but that stone is on the very beginning and that makes it the #1
---
Really nice, good job :)
---
More than enough for personal needs is good enough.
---
I sell expensive things too almost half price, because it is enough for me. Congrats!

you can "farm" magic find by salvaging ectos. that turn you into dust of the same value and give you magic find
---
It does work for Windows 10. (tested)  
---
It was introduced on May 7th 2018 in the version 1803 build 17661.  
---
If you have not installed that update it won't work.  
---
Also, if that's the case i'd urge you to update your Windows as you're setting yourself at a security risk by not updating.  
---
Good Luck and have Fun on your further adventures :)
---
5 more years and you'll find your print key
---
Lets play who can fly the longest! he'll go first!
---
It's completely normal.
---
Also there's issues with many things. 
---
Crafting for example could managed much better. it's very tedious, specially the cooking category. There's a gazillion of recipes, all mixed up so if you don't know the name of the one you want good luck finding it. There should be a favorite category and filtering based on atributes/effects it gives, things like that.
---
I think they are okay the way they are.

Sadly the lighting washed out the original photo. I tried adjusting it in photoshop to make it come out more.

I don't think I ever had an issue with this stone until I saw this post. I then became more aware of it and in my first go of the day, focused on avoiding it and ended up hitting it and falling immediately.

When I first told her I had some line artwork of a character she voiced in 2013-2014, she looked confused, but when I handed them to her, her face lit right up.

I Remember it Being 100g in the beta and pre-release. We us e to think that was crazy insane

Btw for these kinds of question the Wiki is a great ressource and if you don't find the answer we have a [Weekly Question Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dk3j5y/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_october_19_2019/) that is probably a bit more suited than a dedicated thread.

This!
---
Sometimes enemy blob disappears and then suddenly our blob is 50% dead, me being one of the first ones dead. It happens very fast. Then rest of our blob kill enemy blob or wipe while I am running back.
---
I try to spam dodge and press everything (heal button, condi removal, stun break, stability, teleport etc.) but my char is perma-stunned, has zillion conditions and it dies like a critter. It does not matter if char is full glass cannon or full tank. Tank dies little slower.
---
Sometimes I wonder where is our blob support, where is healers, condi cleaners and boon/stability givers, they don't help at all.
---
LB ranger and staff ele has worked just fine in blob fights because they can stay far away from the blob. Deadeye too, though it can't aoe. Everything else seems to die.
---
My bane is the one girder near the top that has the small block in front of it. Every so often that girder is like "nope" and I jump against it.
---
Nothing needs to be changed. The griffon is hands down the best mount for long distance travel. A lot of people just don't know how to use it properly.  Once you have mastered it, it's a flight experience I have yet to find in any other game. holding inertia with the griffon is some of the most fun rewarding content in the game, especially when you get precise enough with it to avoid tight obstacles. Even at 1,000g the griffon would be worth it
---
GZ!
---
Skyscale is literally the best in slot mount to get from one place to another if there’s both vertical and horizontal areas in the way, which turns out to be most areas in the game. By barrel rolling when climbing you can get much higher than the springer (especially with bond of vigour), much faster (springer is very slow across horizontal areas) and without the need to have horizontal planes to leap off of like the springer.
---
Every time I accidentally cling to a wall with the skyscale I want to beat the keyboard with my face
---
Takes more time
---
Yes, I remember something like this too, but can't find where it was mentioned. It was long time ago.
---
They abandoned the very first iteration of WvW restruct concept and started doing some other iteration.
---
So I don't know if you know how it works or not, but all your character's information is right out in the open. Anet's ui just hides it. You dont have to "dig" to find it any more than you have to dig to find their character name or see their health bar. These things, including gear and traits, are broadcast by your character 24/7 right out in the open. All gear check does is pull the same information out of the air like a radio antenna.
---
In short yes, its completely trivialised if i let someone gg, stay dead in middle and i take "merciful intervention" to teleport into mid. It isnt a solo tho, and i thought it was extremely exploitative.
---
Good fractal teams run with no healer. Most pug groups run a heal firebrand. It’s part of the firebrigade composition. The composition provides high dps and pumps out quickness and alacrity. But that’s stuff you shouldn’t worry about yet.
---
The thing with sword and dagger is that both are condition weapons. So, basically all you use sword/dagger is to auto attack, so it’s all preference. Sword is nice cuz it has nice movement skills.
---
Snowcrows will give you the best raid builds. Metabattle can sometimes be sketchy, but is better for anything outside raids. [Discretize](https://discretize.eu) will give you the best fractal builds.
---
Does it matter which kit you use?
---
You will need windows 10, and is a global command.
---
That's 0 dps gain
---
i have 4 Monitors, and when i "print" i need to cut it, so i use the windows feature. But Print + Paint was my favourite xD
---
But would that keep the tooltip up?
---
&gt; Last I checked prices of runes were absolutely sky-high
---
The only really expensive one is the superior health one at 65k. The vast majority are 100g, with most useful ones at about 2k. I think it’s quite reasonable
---
It means you fed another 9k to one of those tp barons that rly don't need those 9k.
---
&gt; when i "print" i need to cut it
---
The game takes over the button and saves its own screen in its own folder.
---
&gt;I am not sure on the soulbeast option. Be aware that for high content content the most viable option of those will most of the times be the dragonhunter.
---
Power soulbeast is just as good as Dh in most scenarios, specially taking into consideration that you can bring frost spirit (on fractals since druid/Chrono is not used anymore) and also stanceshare. It's a very solid pick for the Dps role.
---
As for similar classes to core warrior playstyle.
---
As suggested DH, power Soulbeast and I guess Power berserker (yes, still warrior, but different elite spec https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/power/ )
---
I just came back after a 4 year break thanks to hot and the grinds for currencies are real.. I'm considering another 4 year break after a month haha.. So not a lot at this time.
---
Why the fuck there's only 10k gold price cap? I understand that GW1 had only 100 platinum cap because it was an old game but did they did the same mistake and can't raise the gold limitation in GW2 as well because of technical difficulties?
---
The new Navi/RDNA/5700-series cards are a trainwreck with older titles. UE3-engined games are horrendous. Quake3-based games are buggy and glitchy. GW2 is unplayable without the d912pxy driver.
---
Oh, and now I'm getting audio stutter over HDMI in GW2 that wasn't there when I used a USB DAC.
---
I have a rubbish old GT 750Ti that does a MUCH better job in GW2 than my 5700XT. It's an entry level $149 card from six years ago. GW2 and Navi is just flat-out broken, and d912pxy *kind of* works as a temporary fix as long as you're not feeding audio through the graphics card.
---
Whatever you do don’t sell on TP - you’ll get about half of what it’s worth.
---
gw2exchange doesn't violate ToS at all. It's a "buyer beware" system that anet isn't going to moderate, but it doesn't break any rules. Using trusted middlemen on there is very reliable and safe, and there is massive incentive to do so to get around the ridiculous 15% tax and 10k gold cap
---
I got one pre. It was the underwater spear pre. :(
---
I always go Human/Street Rat, and for the 4th mission I choose to Rescue Quinn.  I typically play Thief because Shortbow is awesome, and lately (for fun) have swapped out D/D for P/P as I find it's just faster to burn down single targets.  I can down Doc with 3 keypresses.
---
By far the 'longest' part of the process is clicking on that the stupid level diamond and choosing your reward.  I typically use 20 Tomes of Knowledge (I have about 4 stacks in the bank) and then buy LV 20 weapons from the NPC depending on what I feel like doing.
---
What content do you do with it?
---
Your response makes no sense.
---
The guy simply said that new specs would make him the most excited.
---
He never said he dislikes the rest of the game. Other things could also make him excited, just not as much.
---
I think you missed the point by miles and i have a feeling that you do not understand how to use the griffon. And this does not mean you have to be god of flying you simply seem to have missed out that you with one button press in the air can glide all over a map without dropping down. This is a learn to fly griffon probably and not a you must be god at it. I am certainly not god at it, infact i am pretty terrible but understanding the button and you get a whole new experience out of the griffon.
---
Gameplay they are almost nothing alike. I personally liked gw1 way more though. The skills were much more technical and had a much deeper strategy when putting a build together. Nowadays I'm not sure how active it is, but it could be worth a look
---
Here i looked the video up and you will realise that the griffon have it all you simply don't understand how to use it.
---

Anet needs to be burned to the ground if they ever give legendary gear better stats then ascended.
---
Really? I own minstrell and I have no instrument

 Crafted old way without quest anyway
---
Ah, I don't have Win10. Never mind then. Win10 does not work on my old computer (constant bluescreens on Win10 + it works really slowly, meanwhile Win7 works amazingly fast without problems). Got a firewall though, so security shouldn't be an issue.
---
Thank you! You have fun too.
---
This is what happens when you make a trailer for a game that is not yet released. You have to make it look good and sort of predict what the engine is going to be capable of when it's done.
---
Then as you continue developing, things change, systems get finalized and the team has to go through and optimize things for gameplay and performance.
---
I feel like for GW2 the highest priority was to get the combat experience to look the same inside and out. To be able to see every player's skills and have them look good, to be able to hear every player's voice lines. It was pretty revolutionary at release for a DX9 engine.
---
You are using condition glass cannon gear, when Reaper is a direct damage class. You should switch to Berserker or maybe Valkyrie if you aren't very good at open world.
---
7 years. Over 20k hours. I can feel your pain like mine... T.T

Probably, hard to say
---
Shiny! I've only had the Energizer drop, that's my rng blessing for the rest of my gw2 life
---
Back then 100g wasway more expensive actually as the gold was tighter
---
Since Arenanet didn't trademark it, the answer is no, by definition.
---
Litteral who stone?
---
disgusting
---
Yes.
---
Essentially you'd have find a middleman and trade through him.
---
A middle man at first might sound like just another person to potentially scam you, but those people have their reputation to uphold, which is worth way more in the long run for them. Not only would nobody ever trade through them anymore, they'd also be blacklisted from every exchange community (shared blacklist across them) and be kicked out of every trade arrangement and/or network they built.
---
They'll probably also already have more than enough money themselves for the idea of scamming an 18k item to not even be tempting anymore.
---
what event?
---
Exactly, it's not about fixing the mode for those people. It's about getting their class buffed and others nerfed (looking at you Bad Med, you fucking troll). 
---
The devs should totally ignore most everyone and actually make their own damn plan and stick to it. 
---
But make the plan, COMMUNICATE IT, and then stick to it.
---
Dear ArenaNet,
---
rest of the text coming soon...
---
Eh, I know mine is making alts and dressing them up, with occasional decorating in my guild hall.
---
So the thing with fractals is that you get some free stat points, which means you can do a bit of optimizing. At the end of the day, you can just use raid builds in fractals as well. You’ll only be losing out on a few percent of dps, which will be negligible. However, using fractal builds in raids will have a bigger effect on your dps, but still acceptable. You can use raid or fractal builds in open world all you want. You’ll be squishy, but your dps will be amazing. You’ll shred any mob in open world easily.
---
For your case, I would just build the fractal power soulbeast build, since you’ll be focusing on fractals.
---
Every time you accidentally cling to a wall with the skyscale you would have facesmashed it and dropped all speed with the gryphon because they have the same hitbox...
---
Don't come back, if pvp is what you are looking for, in a massive scale, better go to elder scrolls online or wait for camelot unchained, wvw was completely neglected for the past 2 years, devs completely ignored every player on forums, balance changes were either atrocious or invisible, they usually break specs completely or just make minimal uncalled changes to random skills, and they don't even aknowledge or   
---
 take back mistakes, its obvious their focus right now is to sell skins and cosmetics, qol stuff, and bland pve content which takes months to make and hours to complete. Pvp is almost dead, with same problems of heavy unbalance, with 2 specs ruining the game for everyone else, and even pve is slowly dying with less players on each instance and meta map day after day.
---
Ok, the panel that you're walking on with that stone ahead.. walk to the very end of it and then jump to the platform beyond that stone. Longer jump, but less risk than the stone.
---
yeah, ive been walking to the side, the puzzle really isn't hard, people just haven't built the muscle memory yet
---
Been playing since launch. Years of nothing then with the un'ided gear change I saved up several stacks of them and during Canthan New Year and the MF bonus it gives went to Silverwastes. Loaded up on as much MF as I could and opened them. Got an Energizer. So, yeah, probably don't do that.
---
or 20000 if youre selling via reddit
---
that and clearing the next cog on a clear long jump, after that its ok. I'm sure my strats are bad lol
---
Should have probably put more as "your account situation/wealth" because there is more to account wealth than raw gold/materials/investments. So for your case it would be more could the fact that you have a lot of characters for each class make this template more interesting than if you had 1 character of each class for example (ie. needing 1 additional gear template for a couple of characters vs. needing on average 2 more gear templates for all  9 characters)?
---
It's not to try and discredit your position or your video but more to see if you took this aspect into consideration because the way one approches those templates can vary greatly depending on their account.
---

1. the pretzel bun is the worst bun for anything that's even slightly liquid because it does not absorb anything. It's go the consistency of a dry sponge.
---
2. The roast beef they use for that sandwich must be heated with water because there was water all over the inside of the cardboard box they give you the sandwich in. 
---
3. The "Beer cheese" sauce they put on these neither tastes like beer or cheese. It tastes mostly like horseradish .
---
4. The onion rings they put on the sandwich are pretty good but redundant if you're also ordering onion rings.
---
Been playing since beta weekend with 5.5k hours and still no epic drop. No precursor, nothin.

I am always on the winning side.

Why you may ask ?

Because yoy don't win a war week game based on cap &amp; control objective only by winning fights not achieving anything else beside that.

My lucky day came when I didn't even realise. 1k in at PoF release, found the rare mini awakened abomination. At first I didn't see the mini. Then I checked the price and saw it had no sell order. So I thought I was a mastermind and looked up the most expensive mini's at the time, and saw it was about 600g at the time. PoF just released so I thought I'd put it at 200g before the price went down. It was sold in an hour and after a week the mini was worth 9k gold, I guess I learned the hard way.
---
My economic situation is ok but not like thousands of gold. I have 3 leg armors and am drowning in ascended. And it's mostly for the characters with leg armor that I could really use the other templates (2 per character usually), for the others 1 more should do it. So when I did a rough simulations I would have needed a a few thousands of gold in gems to get all the templates assuming 400 gems iirc.
---
As I said in another reply I should have framed that more as a "account wealth" more than "raw/monetary wealth" to include also number of characters because I feel that depending if you have 1 of each class or 2 or each class (mules excluded) your feeling/experience of the templates will be a lot different in term of cost and usability.
---
Well yea but setting it up takes more time than just keeping the default bind ...
---
You can also sell the MC on there. The people who buy massive ampunts of MC wont be selling them on TP but rather crafting them into legendaries etc. And then sell those or use them as currency for this kind of massive value trades. 
---
You sell just about anything that has value there.
---
I mean you never have to think about it again once you change that toggle lol, besides might as well put that one dedicated button on your keyboard to use instead of 3.

Newsflash: meatoberfest existed long before gw2, please leave that rock you're living under and enjoy the outside world once in a while
---
&gt;And the fact that building groups with friends did not work at all. You constantly had to reload the map in hopes that you all land in the same instance.
---
OMG I totally forgot about that, it was so frustrating, when they added the "join party member in instance" thing I was so happy.
---
I only run groups with Mob doors only. It’s much more efficient for farming bags. 
---
Unfortunately most commanders run a sub optimal route even for that missing a lot of opportunity , which is why I take over commanding.
---
Why the condescending overtone though
---
I was looking through it. It's interesting though I don't think I'd ever use it... not that I'd have anything people would want.
---
&gt;The word count of a post has very little correlation to whether or not the post is informed or intelligent.
---
it does correlate though, even if you can find idiocy in "long" posts.
---
Isnt sword better burst than scepter so it would be better everywhere except maybe art because it can destroy the projectiles?
---
Where do you range a boss in fractals? Its simply not needed
---
That is fantastic! Take an upvote!
---
Same. That's why I can count on one hand how often I have gambled with ectos or mystic toilet. The reason why I strongly hesitate to open bags when they are more valuable. I need the gold.
---
I got it done at reset, there was a group doing it. I would check a gw2 timer website and check in on the maps it should be at when it's up. People are definately still doing it :)
---
You can get it from the Skritt vendors in Hooligan's Route in Lion's Arch

You aren't a beginner once you get that far. It takes weeks of playing, at least if you play like a normal person.

---
Shimmering and Tenebrous weapons are a much better alternative.
---
They require you to have access to the gathering nodes HoT guild halls, and the recipes take quite some guild commendations, but once crafted you can select any stats, and they stay account bound.

It's not more expensive. Skyscale costs 212 gold (at current tp buy order prices) + up to 80 extra gold if you use pungent foods.
---
Well then wtf
---
i mean that swearing is common even tho it shouldn't be.
---
&gt; Also all other pvpers must be saints  
---
just because other pvpers behave incorrectly is not an excuse for you to be like that too
---
&gt; And i am quitting, I will be sending stuff over to mah guildies cause I love them, friends since 7 years Q\_Q 
---
i get why you are pissed but when people say stuff like this i feel like all they want is to start some drama and anet sucks even tho this is imo unrelated to whether you should be suspended or not. a whole week suspensions feels like way too much especially when this is the first time you got into trouble.
---
Thanks! Guess I'll wait for rest and see what happens haha
---
"wah wah I broke the rules and Anet took action how dare they I'm going to throw my toys out of the pram because I thought Anet would ignore the report". Grow the fuck up jesus christ.

Lol
---
I am So Proud of my community for reporting the toxic players of PvP. While language is subjective, I’m happy to see some of the toxic players with their toxic language being banned. 
---
That said, if you’re serious about quitting the game, feel free to send me crap.
---
But you’re not quitting. There’s no chance. You’re just here to cry and QQ hoping for sympathy points. No chance my dude

5 vitality and 9 agony resistance. insane.

Even if they were "Profession bound", and the same for all characters of the same profession, it'd be way too much.

gw2 has a build in variant though, it'll save the .png straight to your documents folder
---
So someone clarify. I swear in game a lot. But I always thought swearing was ok. Just general swearing. Like of fuck bla bla. Not swearing at someone.
---
Reason I thought seeing was ok is because there is a filter. To filter out my words of people dont wanna see it.
---
Do I need to stop swearing lol? 
---
Trouble is I naturally speak like a cockney lonson chav 😢
---
Why would u waste so much time instead of using windows native function to screenshot ? You can then simply paste it somewhere /upload it, instead of opening the directory for gw2 screenshots and then paste it somewhere/upload it.
---
Congratz.
---
Anyone would have rebooted gw2, you must be special.
---
Moooom, I told you not to follow me on the internet!
---
I was in the same situation - until this year I decided not to accept that I couldn’t do it anymore, spent about 1h getting further and further until I finally did it.
---
Then repeated it 15 times (with some fails in between) for AP. Now I can reliably do it in 2 or 3 tries.
---
Did the same yesterday with the Roll Into Madness Race - unlocked that scarf :)

Most of the mods or midman are rich players who will not bother scamming you to destroy their reputation.
---
Only reason the "veteran" players even play wvw is because of their guilds (if they are still active), both pvp and wvw haven't changed at all and are unrewarding and boring after 7 years. Good for him, play another game, he is a good streamer.
---
They put their reputation on the line.

How did you get up the first high bounce and then to the next as ele?

As a random guy that runs cms every day, thats not true. Power chrono is just another DPS and noone bats an eye.

I have a question about this particular legendary as well, do you gain the skin when you craft it or when you equip it?
---
Lucky, 250 groups don't get filled in us. And they also don't want to run pQB.

pretty well where?, the dominant classes in PvP and WvW haven't included scrapper for a while.
---
Ah, for some reason I thought people were playing scrapper in PvP for a bit
---
Actually you only get 8500g :) you coul easily have 18k for it on exchange :D

that was before the rework and even then it was just low MMR cheese for the most part.

Scrapper hasn't been really good at anything for years now.

The roller beetle race? Masteries are really useful for it (mainly the bond of vigor and bond of faith). While bond of faith is very risky, it can save you from wasting 6 seconds climbing a wall. You'll need bond of vigor or an orb to get speed back tho.
---
Seems like we played different games.
---
In warframe you were bottlenecked by slots not loadout slots, quad diping: warframe slots, weapon slots(12p for 2 I think), sentinel slots, riven slots (60p for 3 mod slots) I'm sure I've missed other types of monitised slots. Keep in mind that you need slots to even have the items I'vr mentioned. And orokin reactors for weapons 20p each, the ones for warframes were common. Oh and exilus adaptors for your warframes which were platinum only for a long while. Last time I've played, riven mods we're dirt cheap sealed, with the exception of shotguns which were 80p, which had the lowest chance to drop of any rivens. And opening them didnt guarantee you 100p. Don't spread misinformation like that next time.
---
Example: to make a weapon viable you would need 6p for a slot, 20/25p for a patato. So that's 26/31p per weapon.
---
For a warframe you would need 20p for a slot and 20p for an exilus adaptor. To be fair, patatoes for warframes were pretty common atleast in my group. So that's 40p per warframe. If you didn't had a patotato that's 60/65p.
---
I don't like these build templates, but you don't have to skip details to make another game look better than it is.

And note that throwing something into the mystic forge also counts as binding it into your account.

The "good" thing about Eternity is that it unlocks 3 legendary skins and all their precursors by binding it instead of the usual 1.

---
It's not a violation of ToS and painting it as such just pushes people away from using a legitimate/natural market mechanic.  In the real markets, /r/GW2Exchange would be called a dark pool.  They are natural market phenomena and to restrict them is market manipulation from the regulatory side.  Most MMOs have a mechanism for p2p trading (another super core principal of healthy markets). Everything has pros/cons and Anet chose to not build that in because of the cons of p2p trading, and consequenty, made mail p2p trading riskier.
---
Whenever making large transactions, whether in real life (buying a car, college, house, etc) or in game (which translates into a difference of hundreds of hours of gameplay), it is unwise to not spend a little time and effort to not be swindled.

What the hell is with all these posts lately, and why do none of them ever get removed?
---
Ok lets try and have a discussion here.
---
Author posits that there is endgame content that is skill based.
---
My counter to that is that due to the lack of actual endgame goals (outside of gold farming for cash shop skins) there is very little repeatable content and once you have done it once (ahem) there is no purpose doing anything except what brings you the most gold per hour. Which brings us back to tarir daily picnics etc which as you very well know requires no skill gear or even state of awakeness.
---
You might find doing dungeons or fractals to be fun but I find them to extremely dull after the first... however many times.
---
Again with the "same engine" meme. Can you prove it that the build templates from gw1 were handled by the game engine? And not by something built on top of the engine and that was taking all the information needed from a database? Never saw proof for this.
---
 For what we know guild wars 2 could store informations like items and tallents and skills much differently than gw1 did. This has nothing to do with a game engine.
---
This is mostly OK. If you swear to your team like "shit, they're pushing our lord", I don't think you'll get really reported.
---
When you make it about people, or direct it at people, it becomes a problem. "This team f**kin sucks" in map chat is garbage negativity, expect reports.
---
&gt;Literally gives tarir and meta (aka semi afk autoattack farm) farm as an example of endgame... Which is what? Supposed to be skill based?
---
Didn't watch the video obviously. Where I specifically say that the open world end game has low player responsibility and skill requirement. But hey, don't let not watching the video stop you from commenting on it.
---
Renegade says wut.
---
Even baddies you can super buff them to the point of being op in low tier fracs.

Congratulations! Got lucky myself coming back after 2 years. Opens some leftover BLCs. Bing: unlimited extractor. Game changer item.
---
On the flip side, in all of Guild Wars 2 endgame content you are automatically overgearing the content of you enter it in full ascended of appropriate stats.
---
I don't really think you can compare that to "gear progression" games where often the challenge comes from first approaching the content while being considerably undergeared relative to eventual BIS. That isn't an experience to be expected in Guild Wars 2. 
---
The skill mastery is also quite untrue for many of the roles in Guild Wars 2 relative to gear progression MMOs. For example, running out of resources as a support or healer in other MMOs is simply something that doesn't happen in Guild Wars 2 and makes those roles easier as a result.
---
Guild Wars 2 isn't any more "skill testing" than other MMOs. It just challenges in ways that are slightly different.
---
I occasionally have to mouse-bump my cuddly cat during the CT frenzy. He doesn't mind though. He just wants to be touched.
---
That would mean I can set up my autoclicker to skillcast and then afkfarm my marry way while going to work, but iirc that is not allowed, so auto clickers are not always permitted?
---
This is why you let kids play games at a young age. Their skill in manipulating keyboard and mouse, taking in all the info you get on a screen, the speed you need to digest and then use the info to decide what to do, and all of this is not even a cycle, but a continuous happening. These are good skills to have! Didn't find any games my child enjoyed until they hit 5, and then they didn't really care about it anyways. Did absolutely hand behind later on when their peers were starting to pick up speed for both gaming and typing etc.
---
Also seems like it improved the hand writing for kids that were already good at keyboard gaming.
---
Just saying. She's not just impressive for what she's doing, that's good parenting as well!
---
I'm glad you agree with every other point I made :)
---
It does have an endgame however it's not being represented all that accurately by either Nike or the poster you responded to.
---
To suggest Guild Wars 2 is a "skill-based" MMO while others aren't by implication is a touch silly. The skills are different between the MMOs but one doesn't inherently have more "gear carrying" than the other.

EotM was my first WvW experience so I remember it fondly. I just wish it had skirmish rewards and the same reward track rate as the other maps to draw people back in.

Hey, looking to get more seriously into fractal CMs but I feel my current classes just don’t cut it.
---
For T4 PUGs I’ve been running power Soulbeast, heal Renegade, and occasionally condi Renegade.
---
I know firebrigade is highly coveted so I plan on having a Firebrand but I can’t tell if healbrand or quickbrand is more commonly needed in PUGs. Whichever one is I’ll potentially alter my renegade to be the sword/sword power alacrity share build instead of heal alacrity I’m currently running.
---
But on top of that I want a solid DPS because I feel Soulbeast just doesn’t quite cut it sometimes. I was thinking power Holosmith for a while but ever since they locked out your F skills on overheat I’m not sure how good it is any more? 
---
TL;DR: Should I make healbrand or quickbrand and what DPS specs should I consider for PUGs?
---
Rewards were killed, pips are not given, earned XP was nuked because "OMG users level up their toons easily, kill it immediately!"

And users got the hint and stopped playing there.

Extra bonus points for map being designed back then when "haha fall to your death!" phase was funny (all those "Necro places wall of fear on tiny ledge, kills 50 noobs" videos)

I would pay extra for unique golem skins
---
Also important to note that only foods that are craftable (have recipes to make) are salvageable. So a few of the festival foods (like Soul Pastries) aren’t usable with the composter if they’re only obtainable through drops/purchase because you can’t technically make them.

How many sim games are there, how many hardcore multiplayer games are there, and how many sim-like fantasy MMOs are there?
---
Combo fields used to be everything in gvg or wvw in general builds needed blast finishers and it promoted class diversity. Feel like we're missing out big times now with current boon stacking
---
4 main games with a bunch of add ons each. Sims 4 has 8 expansions packs. Why do you care about mmo features if you just want to dress up and decorate?
---
Jokes on you, I don't go to parties!
---
but even if you ignore the price you are limited to a fairly small number of slots, both per character and the storage
---
3/character by default for builds, with an extra 6 account-wide (3 base, +3 for the first month for free on the gem store).
---
&gt; If Anet can come up with more build diversity
---
The players already did that with what we have. There are many many builds that can be played with one spec.
---
&gt; Can you prove it that the build templates from gw1 were handled by the game engine? 
---
I'm sorry, what? Do you even understand why them having the same game engine matters? Do you even know what a game engine is?
---
The only reason a build template system would possibly be significantly more difficult to implement in one game over another is if their engines are radically different and one of them used the game engine for the implementation. Seeing that both games use essentially the same game engine (to the point where GW2 code was used to improve GW only 1 year ago), there is no reason why there would be a technical difference between implementations. If neither system used the game engine, then there's once again no difference. How could there be a significant difference?
---
&gt; For what we know guild wars 2 could store informations like items and tallents and skills much differently than gw1 did. This has nothing to do with a game engine. 
---
Exactly, so it would be even easier for them to do the same system. The only possible difference would be the engine, which we all know is essentially the same. Do you actually know how the GW system worked? A string was loaded and used to configure builds. Believe it or not, this is the exact same system as GW2 uses for importing. This is the exact same system any programmer would implement, because that's all a template system is.
---
I love these people that defend ArenaNet no matter what. Absolutely baffling. You've got 2 games that are essentially the exact same where it matters for implementation, and yet you believe there are technical challenges in one but not the other. Dude, they've proven that they can implement this system. It was there on release in the 15 year old game. This would not have taken very long at all to implement. Stop defending them when you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
---
As someone with potato internet, it's not that easy.
---
I literally said ONE OF THE REASONS. All the nerfs druid har gotten over the years haven't only been due to PvP and WvW. Anet has left it to perform the role of a spirit bot for raiding, and seems fine with it staying that way with no attention to how it has fallen completely out of the competetive scene. It's pathetic.
---
The point being, this is a two way street. I never said shit about using reaper in the frontline (And even tho it can perform that role, why would you when scourge is a thing). But as far as roaming goes, it's at least as good as any other necro roaming specs. Running anything else doesn't make it a good disenganger.
---
Guardian always being the backbone in a subgroup doesn't make it the only support class in a wvw zerg.
---
Glad they are reducing overall power in pvp. I actually stopped playing pvp and only do the story since HoT dropped because I don't like the pace of pvp anymore.
---
I don't think so. Build diversity will decrease. As a chrono main in raids i had about 6 or 7 templates for different encounters (double that considering tanking). Now without arc templates one build needs to fit all encounters. The anet templates won't be enough for someone trying to minmax.
---
No it isn't. You are misrepresenting the endgame of Guild Wars 2 as "skill-based" and implying that other MMOs are not.
---
This isn't the case. The skills are just different.
---
I think that you've misinterpreted this. They very clearly state the following:
---
&gt; We do not permit the use of any program that […] automate [sic] actions within the game […].
---
ArcDPS build templates automated the changing of skills, traits, and equipment. They can interpret a third-party build template program to be in violation of that policy. And they likely would, considering that they asked /u/deltaconnected to disable ArcDPS build templates. What do you think that they'd do had he declined their request?
---
In the end, their interpretation is what matters and I think that the assumption that they would interpret this statement in the same way that you have is a risk that no one should take. It's simply not worth the risk.
---
6 is a very tiny number if the goal is to get people to buy a lot
---
I never defended anet on this. You seem pretty scared of anet fanbois, as I am of blind hatred. I defend good arguments. The "same engine" argument is flawed. Oversimplification of systems in a mmo is a bad way to defend your argument. I know how it worked. Games can work differently even tho they have the same game engine.
---
Hell, most modern mmos are made in UE4, but not all of them have the same features.
---
There are known middlemen who have been verified and trusted there.
---
Or buy a Badge of Tribute from your guild hall.  That works too, and provides something you can put on the Trading Post for profit.
---
Quick question for the "Be dynamic" achievement in shattered observatory, i.e. the "don't die achievement".

Does getting downed count as dying? Or is it only straight up dying?
---
Fun fact: Chef Mellitus is named after diabetes mellitus.
---
Hi, being one of the mods/middleman of the gw2exchange, it's part of our job to help facilitate ingame trades despite, large or small. As already pointed out by another individual, we're fairly rich and have a reputation amongst the trading community. There is 0 reason for us to destroy that.
---
I've played this game for 3.2k hours and have never noticed this. Wut.
---
Never thought I'd see a comment from you that both makes sense and doesn't praise Anet.
---
We will get one eventually, maybe even one that isn't ugly
---
&gt;Right, and I think I was very clear the the skill thats being tested in gw2 is mechanical play skill.
---
But what is "mechanical play skill"? Are we suggesting that being able to hit the right buttons for a GotL Might output rotation and doing healing that requires very little thought has more "mechanical" skill than healing in a GCD-based MMO? You still need mechanical awareness in those MMOs so you know when to triage, top up, put out proactive healing and you need awareness of the mechanics of the skills you are using and who to use them on. Like I said, the skill is just different, one isn't necessarily more skilful than the other.
---
Alternatively is mechanical skill implying more action combat? If so, I agree, but that distinction really isn't clear.
---
&gt;I think I compared them rather well, actually. In those games the fights aren't always that mechanically challenging (though they can be) but part of the difficulty is cooked in by having you approach them undergeared.
---
I disagree thoroughly here. Compare something like the W5-7 endbosses against recent Heroic WoW endbosses (or CMs vs Mythic). The amount of mechanical challenge in the latter is at least comparable to what is offered in WoW, if not more so. I know less about the situation with FFXIV but my understand is that it is also comparable.
---
&gt;The fact is in a game like retail WoW, a large amount of players don't clear content until an expansion later when they can comfortably outgear it despite low skill level.
---
I understand your overall point, however it doesn't quite match up nor is it a representation of the current situation given how the content releases. It also isn't really the case since TBC and Badge of Justice vendors. Overall point taken!
---
&gt;You will never have *that* experience in GW2, because the difficulty of the fights doesn't get invalidated by a new tier of gear. If you are a glue eater in retail WoW you can just wait an expansion and come back to older content. If you're a glue eater in gw2, well, good luck clearing raids without being carried.
---
In theory, yes. In practice, and how Arenanet has implemented the content, no. We've seen an immense amount of power creep - in DPS, boon uptimes and support output - since Vale Guardian released and this is evidently true given how the tactics have evolved. It also means that being carried in Guild Wars 2 isn't really that uncommon.
---
^(And this doesn't touch upon the burnout of needing to do a four year old boss as "relevant" content!)
---
Both systems have their positives and negatives but one of the big issues that Guild Wars 2 faces is the power creep and that carrying is incredibly easy - because players are already going at the content in BIS.
---
&gt;If you succeed or fail its 100% a factor of skill, experience, or organization. You never fail a raid because of gear.
---
To an extent, I agree. On the other hand, if you go at Largos Twins with a bunch of non-Chrono power DPS, you are going to have a pretty poor time and will likely fail because gearing is incorrect for the encounter\*. Which is another detriment on the idea that Guild Wars 2 is "skill based". I agree that skill is important but for many encounters in the game, the deciding factor isn't your skill. *It is what you are playing*. And this can vary massively between professions without reasonable compensation from having two elites available (please fix and give third Anet). This negates the skill question to a large degree because what is more important is your choice at the character select screen.
---
And that isn't something a "skill based" game should have in my opinion and those imbalances are also neatly covered in gear progression based games due to variation in the gear and breakpoints.
---
^(\*The same is of course true if you turn up in unsuitable gear for your role, which also indicates a general reliance on gear over skill.)
---
&gt; The "same engine" argument is flawed. 
---
It's not if it's the only thing that could possibly affect the implementation.
---
&gt;  Oversimplification of systems in a mmo is a bad way to defend your argument.  
---
It's not an oversimplification. Things like this build system are very simple.
---
&gt; Games can work differently even tho they have the same game engine. 
---
Yes, but the implementation of reading from a file and using that information to configure a build is never going to be different.
---
&gt; Hell, most modern mmos are made in UE4, but not all of them have the same features. 
---
But they use the same methods to read and write information.
---
When it was just as rewarding as normal wvw and people liked it more than wvw because it was rarely dead. You could go there to escape the dead hours on your server or the super bad match up. It had many servers going into it not just the one you were on.  It was a great way to handle the mode.
---
But when it was obviously more popular they nerfed rewards into the ground to drive ppl back to regular wvw.  Now it's a dead map.
---
Mmos arent for you then I'm sorry to say
---
The acievement says it's only when you get defeated eg. die fully. So being downed is ok.
---
A down won’t disqualify you from the achievement. Only a full death.
---
People got tallent
---
I mean it is fun though, trying to take a T3 keep time to time. Fighting can be fun too but gotta balance it. I am more leaning towards trying to cap a T3 structure over fighting. Bonus is most of the fights come from attacking something T3 and they come out play.
---
But 1 set of leggy armor can be used across an infinite number of equip slots on a single character.
---
It's like saying that we should get roller beetle without questing, 'cos raptor is available for free. Skyscale is reliable and nice to move around in cities, climb and so on, but the fun factor and speed of griffon is something completely different (long distance flights and adventures).
---
worked really great for him, no? 150 viewers less than before and 400 subs lost. XD

"Commander? It seems that the risen have tiny baby dragons! What do we do?"

"I think it is time... Prepare the tiny airships to fight them back! This fight is going to be epic!"
---
dont use sword unless you know retal is a guarantee
---
even when retal is covered, scepter still has the benefit of being a ranged weapon, allowing it to still pull ahead in quite a few encounters
---
only run sword on stuff if you've actually thought about why it might be better than scepter
---
I am referring to build templates, that's correct, I even specified that in my comment.  The comment I replied to was also talking about build templates.
---
I guess they might have been talking about the maximum number of build templates after purchases, though, whereas I was talking about how many you get by default.
---
yes, a DLL accessing that information is what is refered to as memory injection.
---
1903 is so much better about this
---
To be fair, he said he would always come back when there is new content. So having him “come back” every few months is exactly the release cadence of GW2.
---
Pls don't sell on tp. People will gladly pay 15-20k gold on gw2exchange or so
---
I think so too. It's all about timing and knowing where to jump.
---
Then again, I played a lot of platformers as a kid so maybe that's why I'm good with jumping puzzles.
---
You have to run RHS with sword for the cooldowns, so you lose out on a huge portion of retal uptime via your heal. Even with PI, retal is still important due to [[retribution]](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Retribution_(trait\)) giving a 10% damage mod.
---
Scepter 2: 0.325s cast time, 2.0 + [0-8] * 0.2 coefficient (depends on how many of the fists hit)
---
Sword 2: 0.565s cast time, 3.0 coefficient.
---
Ok but that's irrelevant, what has the difficulty of savage/ultimate got to do with item level balancing where you're overscaled for everything in the game except the newest tier? Lol.
---
Often players look for LNHB runs on days when 100 is also a daily frac, especially over the weekend. Try that, or just make your own group and see if it fills.
---
Guess thats why they added the Skyscale, we grind for a month to get it so we dont have to scream over how the Springer cant land on its feet properly on the side of rocks or cliff edges.
---
Also I guess people just aren't as concerned about mount design anymore since the game has gotten so old, back when I made forum posts on griffon release after obtaining it, people had a different view and attitude with me on what problems it had.
---
What's a beetle? LOL (no one uses that shit mount)
---
Ok, after I deleted those shaders I don't get any errors. But it takes 5 or more minutes to load, so it's because my PC is weak? I saw on youtube video it took ~1 minute to load same shaders + "problems"
---
And that damn preset what i wanted to try is using this shaders which give me errors...

Ha. Nice joke.

---
&gt; I think the worst experience I've had has been in casual/zero-essence groups.
---
It sounds like your expectations were out of whack for a zero ess group. Players at that level dont take the game as seriously or put in as much effort as you or I. Plus its a zero ess group they are still learning so everything that is second nature to you is a new thing for them. You can help them and teach them better habits or just leave the zero ess group you joined before 30 seconds into the first pull because you expected them to play like they have been doing cms everyday for months.
---
Nice.   
---
Don't go mad eating it
---
And how many of those are actually full builds? I expect that at least 95% of those extra builds people are crying about with the lack of space are all variations of the same build but with one trait being different. Or the same build but with one or two gear slots going from zerker to assassin's.
---
Lazy mods or afk mods
---
Or
---
Mods enjoy drama since they are mods in reddit
---
I remember them deleting actually useful stuff in the past. So I believe it is on purpose to make the game look bad.
---
Read: I play games to be rewarded.
---
Go fuck off and play the latest mobile gacha game.
---
Ah, that sounds more sensible.
---
I'm still new to GW2(need help, boosted and confused) why is this rare?
---
Bruh.
---
Just because there are those that can praise something for what it is doesn't mean we're blind to missteps. But then again, this sub reddit is quick to judge when someone isn't on the same wagon of circle jerking.
---
I can't go around saying that I actually like the official build templates without people going ape shit on me.
---
Lol, it's like those Scary Movie movies. So bad but you can't just not hate them because of how bad they are.
---
Honestly I forgot EOTM existed
---
I like clinging to a flag pole but instead cling to nothing 10feet from the flag pole because i used the dash when I was passing it by.
---
While I agree with your sentiment. These are things you barely look at.... it would still be nice to get a change that reflects a new "era" of Guild Wars 2. Why else change it even for expansions then if you never stare at it?
---
 I copied MagicBloom.fx to Shaders folder inside Gw2Hook and 2 files - ReShadeUI.fxh and ReShade.fxh (copied with change) and I'm getting the error "MagicBloom.fx(90, 34): error X3082: int or unsigned int type required"
---
But according to google it was fixed in march and i'm using latest version from https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders
---
Nice songs and shield but warrior OP please nerf ;)
---
- power boon chrono
---
- high toughness boon chrono
---
- low toughness boon chrono (that one doesn't require as much change going from 1k toughness, I'll admit)
---
- condition boon chrono
---
- condition toughness boon chrono
---
- power dps chrono
---
- condition dps chrono
---
- condition dps mirage
---
This is just for raids btw. And all of these builds change more than just one or two things. Now add fractals, open pve, WvW and you get a couple more builds. :)
---
Revenant, Guardian, Warrior easily have 6+ builds just for raids and fractals. Ranger and Necromancer can have quite a lot of builds across multiple game modes.
---
Also some builds have a nasty combination of 2 or even 3 different stats on weapons/armour/trinket (e.g. boon chrono has assassin/zerk/diviner, condi fb has grieving/sinister/viper spread across all gear).
---
So no, it's not just a single trait, single utility skill, or a single gear piece that's different.
---
is bloom disabled in your gw2 setup? disabled post processing too?
---
edit, i'm no expert on this btw, just some trouble shooting tips i picked up along the way that helped me
---
I try every year, but have never made it.  I am just too slow.
---
Jumping puzzles are definitely my least favorite pat of the game and I avoid them as much as I can.
---
You mean the fastest land mount, that I see used by tons of people traveling medium to long distances?
---
What's LNHB?
---
My blood sugar went up just looking at that cake
---
When finishing the lvl 10 story you earn a black lion key (limited to one per week) which is used to open black lion chests. These contain unique skins that are bound to them and are some kind of lootbox since you can also buy keys for real money. 
---
A lot of people do the story once a week to have a chance to gain these skins or other rare/expensive items since there are not too many options getting those otherwise.
---
Converting gold to gems is one and finishing maps is another but from that its just around a 30% chance drop.
---
Then just do a few button clicks and you don't need templates anymore?
---
You "sell" it and the other account bound part of legendary by trading a complete legendary for the non account bound materials and some extra gold.
---
You can either directly sell on the TP for a huge upfront investments, or possibly get better deals using marketplace sites.
---
Some sites exist(ed?) solely to connect players who want to "buy" the gifts and other materials from another player. Not sure if any are still active.
---
Yeah biggest hurdles are WvW and dungeon tokens for me. I'm saving my Tyrian Exchange Vouchers for whatever my next legendary may be.
---
I am fully aware of much of the feeling that this creates for the community, and it wouldn't have to be done at the extent that it is in other games to work, but for MMOs, that require a consistently-playing, strong playerbase to function, it's a successful, working model. It's no surprise that many people who play Gw2 often find themselves just outright leaving after playing newly released content for a day or two. There is most certainly a problem, and the solution for endgame is to give players an actual reason to play.
---
Yeah the wintersday you still see the other characters. They can really block the view which is tough in timed JPs.
---
There are only a couple spots where the jumps are a bit tricky, most of the difficulty comes from how little time there is.
---
Oh.. I'm rather new to this, so it never crossed my mind to put it on another character... Ty :D
---
Still. Nothing. After. 15000. Hours.
---
noob
---
I am sad to inform you that you, too, legally accepted the 'rules of the game' the moment you installed the software (gw2) and clicked the 'I agree' button.
---
You may think you are some badass revolutionary here, but you are just making a fool out of yourself.
---
Makes sense, but honestly, that has nothing to do with the clocktower tho!
---
Most likely because they didn't want to make them. They probably only made them now because of the layoffs/ban fuck ups. It's low hanging fruit and if well implemented would have made the community much happier, but they fucked it up.
---
Ohhh ok, I can see the inherent flaw in that now. How can a game like FFXIV allow storage of like 50 macros and 20 individual class armor sets and 100 stores cosmetic skins but gw2 can only store 6 gear sets? Something is fishy here. -jumps on anti-template hype train-

I'll always miss guardian hammer 4 on ledges.

Here is a post from taco's developer:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5rhpse/taco_allowed_or_not/dd7x8pj/
---
As you can see, it only gathers information from the offical API, or other valid sources.  It doesn't touch game code or anything else.  
---
However, as BoyC points out in that post, even reading reddit is a violation of the EULA.  The EULA is purposefully made vague so Anet has the freedom to do what they want to keep the game in the state they want.
---
I really wish they'd make the Warclaw a limited resource in WvW, instead of as a standard mount anyone can summon at any time (Which broke the game mode badly).
---
Well, he's got a nickname 'Prostituto' for a reason.
---
OMG
---
Two days after anet deleted mine because I bought it from a guy who was involved in RMT. :'(
---
Agreed but in a lot of games there are incentives to do things over and over again...
---
Here... I don't know. LW s4 is the perfect example. Do the story, get the mounts, never touch again...
---
Whenever a post comes up like this I look back at my 10+ years of Guild Wars and wonder what my rarest drop was, I can never even think of anything.
---
There's still almost two weeks left.  You're surrendering too early!
---
Clearly, you've opened my eyes! After all these years playing various mmos. Now I know they aren't for me! /s
---
I do love the implication that wanting a decent reward structure, good incentives and just you know... Something to do that isn't the same 15 fractals means that all mmos are not for me...
---
Yeah, I do it too.   
---
\*le the necessity of playing with others, 400 ascalonian tears, only ONE run is required to finishing the legy\*  
---
me: no, better spend 900 gems on keys and hope that MAYBE you'll get the voucher  
---
But I'm not complaining, lately I got from a chest the jackal deer I meant to buy anyway, so it was a save :3
---
I agree, but you obviously haven't seen their comments in the past.
---
perma hold forward, max out camera turn speed, pump up that mouse sensitivitiy so you can do a 360° with a lil swing and then learn to jump.
---
Did you mean, "more than the developers put into the actual balance fixes"?
---
Will do! I am still failing at the jump-down part.
---
I dont think so, havent seen that option before, you could do that with are however
---
Because they make a small cut. The Mods probably exchange millions worth of gold for people over time. Scamming for a measly 20k puts a huge dent in their record which is why you can look around and you won't even find people *alleging* that the mods have scammed someone. 
---
They could steal a few 20k infusions, but then inevitably there'd be very concrete proof of a scam which would cut them off from hundreds of thousands of potential revenue.
---
I like that idea.
---
And I agree, at least partially. When 3 or 4 updates have come out and players in the back are still struggling to catch up with the meta, then there's a problem. Other MMOs use gear treadmills as an incentive to spend money to catch up, it's often used as a business tactic rather than a genuine upgrade, and to do it to that extent would be criminal.
---
One thing I loved about HoT after Path of Fire dropped was the length of time it took to complete masteries, and how you had to put in active effort to explore every nook and cranny of the jungle to gain the highest level possible. I have every single achievement from HoT done. To do this day I still haven't fully completed even one of the Path of Fire map achievements, but I still have more masteries than I know what to do with.
---
It wasn't terribly inconvenient, but it gave me incentive to pursue something I otherwise wouldn't focus on, and took me much more time as a result. Not all grind needs to be for things that are relevant to stats or combat; but it still needs to be there.
---
For direct comparison, Path of Fire masteries took me less than a week to max. Heart of Thorns masteries took me 4 months.
---
I heared from people who put a dot sticker in the mid of their screen to always know where their char is.
---
split surge mirage is pretty low interaction. like, REALLY low interaction. It's quite mindless.
---
I mean if you have a large collection of ectos, mystic coins, T5 T6 mats etc, people are always looking for these.
---
because that would be the thief skill
---
HOLY FUCKING HELL KILL IT WITH FIRE BEFORE IT LAYS EGGS
---
Because that would be useful and this is anet
---
I think the problem was that they didn't confine it to PvP, and that it kinda hit PvE builds pretty hard in a way that was unnecessary. Scourge in PvP was genuinely OP and needed to be nerfed. I played it. I could faceroll and still win without trying. That's not fun, but I really like Scourge in PvE. It's just that PvE scourge really needed to cover larger areas with not just their shades but also where they were positioned, and as a result this nerf kinda hits the playstyle pretty hard. The intent of the changes completely failed at what it actually did. It was intended to nerf the PvP side of things while helping WvW and not really touching PvE. It Nerfed PvE, Destroyed PvP, and didn't really do anything to WvW as the builds just had them stay in sand savant. THE NERF WAS MEANT TO PUSH THEM AWAY FROM USING THAT.
---
I'm still playing classic a lot, to the detriment of my sleep schedule in fact ez
---
Because if it let you choose the destination, it'll be thief downed skills 2 and 3 at the same time, but better because it also makes a decoy and it's 15 seconds for both abilities.
---
To make compensate, then thief would have to have both teleport and smoke bomb  combined in one, and a new skill 3  that summons a thief from the thieves guild for 2 seconds, or the teleport distance be increased a lot, or something.
---
It isn’t an option as far as I know. It just appears as an AoE orange bar that appears across the ship a little bit before the wind starts blowing. Like with everything a lot of “potato graphics” might be the cause, you can try fiddling with character model limits in case that’s the issue. 
---
If there’s a possibility you’re colorblind I know certain AoE indicators are slightly different and can make it harder for colorblind players to see. 
---
In case you see it but are still getting hit, know that the wind cannot be mitigated by blocks or stability. You have to just position yourself appropriately or dodge.
---
Good video that shortly explains every part of PvE that you can do after hitting lvl 80.
---
dont we all (?)
---
Hahaha years? To implement templates? Clearly he was writing one word per week.
---
Yup it's pretty good for healing. If you get multiple targets too you can get a ton more. I was linked[ a thread talking about it](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/744236/) too.
---
I'm not saying build templates, gear and storage should be so limited but let's be real here. How many actual players have as many builds as the ones you posted?
---
The majority of players probably don't even break 4 or 5.
---
People with that many builds are outliers, frankly, and yes, it does suck that you're getting gimped.
---
That's still 6.
---
I probably have. I just tune people out after a while.
---
I'm not disputing the difficulty of Ultimates, I've also been playing XIV and I agree - Ultimates require more from players than CM's do in GW2. Still has nothing to do with the fact that the majority of the game is irrelevant thanks to item levels. The point about "it doesn't matter that it's irrelevant because the gear it provides is no longer top tier" is complete garbage. There is no good reason for systems like this to even exist and I just do not understand the hunger for vertical progression such as this - it devalues so much of the game. When vertical progression in itself is making you exponentially stronger for no other reason than chasing higher numbers on the user end for more grind, you have a big problem with what I consider longevity of fun engagement in the majority of the game's content. 
---
God I wish Arenanet would give us the service that SE do with XIV instanced content. ):

I don’t play Engi but I’ve heard Holo has some good DPS...but again, I don’t really know, just conveying what I’ve read

Additional sources, though:

&gt; ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;

&gt; The data subjects are identifiable if they can be directly or indirectly identified, especially by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one of several special characteristics, which expresses the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, commercial, cultural or social identity of these natural persons. In practice, these also include all data which are or can be assigned to a person in any kind of way. For example, the telephone, credit card or personnel number of a person, account data, number plate, appearance, customer number or address are all personal data.

&gt; The GDPR applies to ‘personal data’, meaning any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier. This definition provides for a wide range of personal identifiers to constitute personal data, including name, identification number, location data or online identifier, reflecting changes in technology and the way organisations collect information about people.

&gt; Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data... Personal data that has been rendered anonymous in such a way that the individual is not or no longer identifiable is no longer considered personal data. For data to be truly anonymised, the anonymisation must be irreversible.

Interesting! One post says the healing power is multiplied by .07, but the wiki says .015. they must have nerfed that part. Doesn't affect me though, since my Healing Power has no bonus
---
&gt; 90% chance to teleport me into even deeper shit
---
You really think it's that low?

As I said

&gt; my scourge alone has 6 builds.

I have more for core and reaper.
---
Yeah, one, good luck.
---
Two, not the brightest idea here man. We already had someone get scammed out of a Twilight this way.
---
Holo has gotten nerfed recently and it's not as good as it once was but it's still playable
---
Tbh, I'm happy with the number we have. Most niches feel filled, we don't want any redundancies
---
I have a problem with determining distance in gw2, it all looks so 2d(?) to me, like there is no depth in what I'm looking at. Also my mind goes on auto pilot after 50 tries or so.

LUL i like how you call them a dude after they say help a sister out trying to use that egirl shit

Not sure on the healing power amount but that last edit was made by someone not logged in last month. Not sure if they figured out a more accurate value or the info is wrong I don't have the runes to test with anyways. Really though the bonus healing is super minor and the amount is small you'll scale it much higher with just more procs.

---
&gt; WvW and dungeon tokens
---
Dungeon tokens are still quite easy to get. WvW is a nightmare... just running around doing nothing then cap some small stuff to keep up your participation. I tried to play seriously for some time in order to not just be a dead weight but it just becomes annoying if you are always running the same ways, fighting the same enemies and hearing the same "gogogogo, right right, dodge... dodge again, bomb in front, etc" again and again.
---
Real curt, where ever there are rewards ppl will go.
---
One thing I find strange is so many voicing their opinion that "no more eotm ktrain" when its literally free real estate on a 4 hr timer (albeit a rather nerfed ktrain, admittedly) as there's no one else on the enemy teams to interrupt you since its "dead". The champs are still there, the objectives are still there, everything is still there it takes a min of 2-3 players to take certain objectives (namely tytone champ + OG keep rest is legit solo-able on right build) so why not grab guildies and go farm it every 4 hours? It takes approx ~1 hr to cap the entire map with just 3-5 players assuming everyone is running decent gear. The quickest run I ever experienced was done in just over 45 mins with a couple friends + random pugs. From my memory, it was anywhere 2-4 tomes. Give or take, its something to do if you really feel like going in there.
---
Let's be real here eotm being more rewarding was unhealthy for WvW population/game mode... needed new blood (and still does). It's just whack to have that kind of system in place, especially since many players abused rank farming in there.
---
Eotm still serves its purpose; a place to go when there are WvW queues and by all means players can still farm it if they really want to just form a group and go ham.
---
If anything, I feel sorry for those that didn't take advantage of the ease of access regarding AP + achieves... you seen some of those? It's like cap 3k gens...? lol have fun with that nowadays. Anyway point being - I would be in favor of adjustments being made to eotm if it did not suck players away from WvW (WvW should be priority in terms of rewards etc), an already painfully neglected game mode.

---
&gt; Just like many people here, I have been playing video games for quite a while and I have discovered which games fit me and which don't. With this said, one game, or in this case game mode, has risen above them all for me. This game mode is Guild Wars 2 World verse World.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I feel this game has the potential to become a major force within the gaming industry. There are very few games that offer mmo pvp combat with groups of these sizes and gameplay that is this much fun (in my opinion).
---
&gt;I thought I'd share some ideas that could make this mode more popular and more fresh to the daily player. I'm sure it may not be possible to support many of my ideas so go easy on me.
---
&gt;The first objective is to remove barriers to entry for new players. I believe that the first step should be to remove the equipment and level barrier for new players. Many new players have very low stats or all out glassy gear making them die very easily. Allowing them access to an easy to obtain stat changeable exotic set could answer this problem. The equipment would be WvW stat specific unlike pvp. If they like the game mode, they can work towards ascending through a reward track of some kind.
---
&gt;Add builds, guides, and videos (similar to metabattle) to the game interface. Players rate which builds/guides/videos are best (similar to Dota 2).
---
&gt;Have a guild recruitment list so new and experienced players can find guilds that suit their playstyle (similar to eve). New players get needed gameplay help. Experienced players find needed experienced fight guilds. Being in guilds/being in comms are also important in having a good experience in WvW.
---
&gt;Built in VOIP (discord) similar to CS:GO or Dota 2. As said above, making it easier for people to be in comms makes for a more exciting experience in WvW. Their will of course be options to mute, kick and even ban people depending on if you're the commander, lieutenant, guild leader, etc.
---
&gt;Allow new users to gain access to auto loot, mounts and gliders. This auto loot will allow new users to make the much needed gold when starting out. The mount and glider will help newbies follow commanders when moving from fight to fight. It would be bad for the commander to have to go into a fight without his full force with him.
---
&gt;Increase size and visibility of wvw entry button. Make it easier to choose which link to follow when on wvw map selection screen. Possibly get rid of eotm and consolidate wvw maps. Have a "jump into the battle" button. Have Newbie and experienced interfaces for joining maps. Similar to Team Fortress 2 one can click to auto find a server or find a server manually. Also remove small leave mist button and replace with bigger, more visible leave button.
---
&gt;Every few months we could have a different season which introduces a new map to the game. The players vote on which map they want. This will keep the gameplay fresh and fun.
---
&gt;Put in 15 man Guild vs Guild matchmaking system (with spectator mode). Guilds can schedule times to meet up within about the week. (similar to CEVO tournament system in CS:GO). An ELO ranking system is in place. A guild as well as a player can have stats (in game arc dps, will talk about later). The gvg system will go season to season. The system has the capability of being an esports. Although GvG's aren't the best for out of game spectators, usually experienced players will have fun watching the matches.
---
&gt;Guild and personal stats: A system that shows damage, healing, cleanses and strips as well as other data, similar to arc dps, would help in matchmaking for GvG system.
---
&gt;As the years have passed I feel that most players play for the fights, not necessarily the sieging that takes place. I offer the idea of making maps with less objectives to defend and attack and make for a terrain that allows for fights happening more often as well as making fights more exciting.
---
&gt;Red vs Blue server balance system (Alliance vs Horde example): The goal of this system is to keep maps populated and fights relatively fair. Servers (maguuma exp) will be split into either red team or blue team. Similar to our current repairing system, sides would be balanced every few weeks with a certain set of servers on each side. By having two sides instead of an array of servers within tiers, we can fill up maps more easily, especially in off hours (OCX, SEA, EU). This is done by having maps ordered from top the bottom, the top being the most populated map and the bottom being the least populated map. Instead of only having 2 servers to play against (within tier),  you would have 6 servers to play against (plus smaller servers) for each side (red vs blue). This system would also has a reservation system to allow guilds access to populated maps during prime time. What this system would do would be similar to a restaurant, guilds can reserve a time on a populated map like a restaurant reservation. To stop guilds from making more reservations than they need, a penalty system should be in place to make sure guilds make it to their reserved time slot and actually use them. 
---
&gt;I have some more ideas for the game in general but these are just a few ideas I have for WvW.
---
&gt;I think it's extremely important to keep the game mode fresh and entertaining and I hope my ideas can help.

I mean, most games now with sub models still have fairly predatory and/or overpriced cash shops as well.  In theory I like how ESO handles their optional sub and wouldn't mind seeing something similar in GW2, though I am sure others would riot (add a few extra features that are maybe worth the cost on their own, but also give you the 1500 crowns as if you had just spent that $15 on crowns only that month).  In practice that breaks down a bit once you look at the actual prices of the things in their crown store.  Charging over a hundred real dollars for a player home, no matter how big, is just too much.  Their premium mount skins can range from $20 up to $50, etc.

FFXIV's sub is mandatory but in the US mount skins for that are in the $20+ range FOR A SINGLE CHARACTER, not even an account unlock  (It's actually less in EU because when they first set the prices the GBP was worth significantly more than the US Dollar , but now even though they are fairly close in exchange rate they have never updated the pricing).
---
SW:ToR has an "optional" sub that is one of the worst nickel and dime free to play models on the planet, and even if you do sub the amount of cosmetics they sell and the prices they can charge are... out of this world.
---
get up those rookie numbers, I did it while being 3 seconds out of sync :P (animation what I see to what is actually there, like after the drop part)
---
I havent been on reddit in a while, I actually kind of forgot how savage it is in here and why I left in the first place. Sorry I asked, someone recommended me to try my luck here. I can now see that was a mistake. No gender card, that's just how I talk.
---
Thanks anyway.
---
I use default and it is just fine
---
Use your thumb
---
Forgot about that part. Sorry, been sick for two days straight and head is a little cloudy.
---
Either way, I still consider you an outlier compared to the majority of players. Though don't take that as "I think the system is perfect and shouldn't be expanded"
---
I have mount skills 1 and 2 on Q and E, while I moved the original Q and E to A and D, didn't need the turn function anyway. makes using the griffon really easy, also drifting is easier this way I think. (it's just E + A or D in my case)
---
I also deactivated the context-sensitive activation i.e. going up with S on the griffon or boosting with space on the beetle. now I can jump with the beetle with a full endurance bar.
---
Yeah, it's just a trick to make the sky look bigger than it actually is.  They never designed it with the intention of any players actually ever flying up there and seeing their trickery.
---
Are we talking about the same thing ? The chests I'm talking about all reward ToT bags. It's not much but I'd not call it junk and iirc taking all 3 of them doubles the total reward for repeats in the puzzle.
---
I used to love EoTM when it was popular trolling karma trainers. It was always full on every side. I actually had fun leveling on that map. Too bad anet destroyed it
---
Makes my hand hurt pretty badly pretty fast. Moving the mount controls to my mouse made everything easier and the movement overall more fluid and enjoyable, especially drifting.
---
Cut the crap, saying that you love something so much but can't afford it for whatever reason and then going "im a girl btw" is the oldest trick in the book.
---
"Hey guys can I buy something from you for 50% of the selling price? I'm totally 100% not going to sell it immediately so I can double my money"
---
As someone with a potato mouse,  it's not that easy.
---
Just another form of old content that was forgotten and never truly looked at again ie Dungeons.
---
"Do you want to know how I got these scars?"
---
I haven’t played it since they nerfed XP and karma.  I understand why they did it but it was always popular for leveling and always crowded.
---
Yes
---
If you have trouble with the depth, I’d recommend trying it top down camera angle
---
Ah I see, that must have been what I noticed. The Chrono+Druid meta is dead and replaced with FB+Rev
---
I remember that one time back in '82 when it actually ported me to a higher ledge and allowed me to safely rezz.
---
You poor poor soul. For real accuracy, use what Shroud does. https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Gaming-Esports-Performance/dp/B07GCKQD77
---
They have pretty much zero access to stability.  That's really what makes them feel awful.
---
Why? Let him play his WoW
---
Oh god... it hurts. You basically gave someone a free 8k gold.
---
I remember liquidating a bunch of stuff to grab the tag before the change happened. I think Lion's Arch was still in ruins at the time, because I remember buying it right next to a flaming pile of rubble.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
LOL, yes.
---
And then Steve comes out of the cake and downs you. Hope the rest of your friends know how to break that bar.
---
BTW, happy birthday!
---
It would be cool to have a bigger player base. I don't see any negative to it
---
Ok last question, and this I feel I know the answer to but I just wanna make sure. These items are account bound, so if I equip it on my necro and then decide later I want to focus on my warrior, I can move said legendary to the warrior and equip and use it? I assume yes but again just want confirmation.
---
Gw2 isnt guild wars. Its the skull fucking of an actual good game
---
It's not even that, I just keep getting stuck on this one STUPID FUCKING BLOCK FROM THE DEPTHS OF HELL about 20 times before I yeet my computer out the window. Every year it's the same fucking block and every year I buy a new computer. But this year I think I have it figured out... This year I'll yeet the mouse instead.
---
I really hope they bring back the communal multi-seater mount. 
---
Making it something with slimy legs so it can't block NPCs, or have a long center of gravity like a snake or salamander.
---
I want to be able to taxi friends around!
---
They tend to be referred to as "mules". I've just slowly built up 1 of every class, now working on 2 of every class. Character slots are cheaper than bank tabs!
---
I play a lot of holosmith mostly in raids and I believe it to be a great dps class with a fun rotation. That can provide decent cc if you take a.e.d.
---
we are all tired of flaming and if we do, we flame anet, so you are good to go, unless you are an anet dev ;)
---
Yes but the debate is not about farming best bags/hour, it's about doing the puzzle and the one reason you can have to not be slow on the first few jumps. At the very least when I have to do it for a daily, I prefer getting all the chests :) It's not just a bit more loot, but also more satisfying.
---
thank you :-)
---
Opposite of my cat. She just wants to sit near your hand, but if you try to touch her she swerves it.
---
Requiem æternam dona ei, Domine

Et lux perpetua luceat ei

Requiescat in pace

Amen

In loving memory of Holosmith

Does it matter? Not at all. Would it be better if they used.. Like, any of the numerous skill icons that are actually made for Guild Wars 2, instead of taking one from Guild Wars 1 and not even scaling it properly to the skill bar? Probably.
---
As an added point, they could have simply done what they did for Backbreaker. That's the 5th skill Warriors get for hammers, as well as an Elite skill from GW1. The icon is virtually the same, but it's scaled properly and might have had some very minor graphical tweaking.
---
use the booster trick, create a second character, use the booster and ask in Lion's Arch if someone can carry you through the first PoF mission, you'll get raptor unlocked for all characters, and you can go back to level up
---
Can just trash talk to game if he doesn't see anything he likes in the video and his fanbase can spread misinformation. 
---
Just let him be he's not about to stop playing WoW for another MMO.
---
First bounce you can actually make with special action key, you cannot jump to get it or you will not get it. You must just aim well. Second was just White mantle portal device IIRC
---
&gt;I mean, most games now with sub models still have fairly predatory and/or overpriced cash shops as well.
---
"Most games" are complete ass when it comes to monetisation. I'm not talking about the double, triple dipping bullshit every major publisher is doing nowadays; I'm talking about a simple, honest box price with a simple, honest subscription fee, like MMOs used to have. Of course no one would ever do that, now that Pandora's Box of bullshit monetisation has been opened, but a man can dream, right?
---
It's fair, but if it's an entry point for new players, I honestly think you just auto-scale them to reasonable stays based on whatever gear they have. Less they have to think about, the better.
---
I've found that jumping into the face BEFORE the actual clock seems to work for my 300ish latency. However, it's still a bit of a crapshoot
---
Today I learned that some people code with words exclusively
---
Every weeb game is probably the same.
---
Yeah, I know, but if someone is falling on the first block 100 times in a row, it certainly isn't their latency causing that, it's not a good excuse.
---
As has always been the case, do what's fun for you.
---
Ascended gear will take a bit of work, but will definitely be obtainable given some time. You'll want to get an armor-crafting profession to 500 to make those pieces. Others can be gotten from fractal runs (you can do early tier 1 fractals with little to no agony), and from laurels you get with daily logins (amulets, trinkets, rings can be gotten this way).
---
Are you interested in specific stuff? Fractals and Raids will both want ascended gear the further in you go, so that's a good starting goal.
---
90g is a fine amount for starting off, it'll get you through leveling the craft and may even swing a couple of pieces of gear if you're frugal.
---
When did he say he was quitting?
---
So, do you think PCIE4 would drastically improve performance in GW2? I'm about to upgrade my PC to ryzen 5 3600 and I did not consider the newest mobo before, but the cheaper previous generation. Now since you are saying that PCIE lanes makes huge difference in GW, I'm not sure if I should go for PCIE4 instead.
---
Gw1 didn't have the issue.
---
EotM was a great way to get newbies into another way to level (aside from asocial questing) and also introduce them to some PvP. Sadly Anet didn't like that, I guess?
---
Man, I really envy people who are coming back after years, there's honestly been a lot of great content for you to catch up on. Hope you find some people to go through it with, HoT maps are awesome, and PoF has really great story missions imo.
---
You don’t need to give me an example, I’m a developer... 
---
There can be unexpected things in development, but there is no unexpected thing that would make implementing a template system difficult. It’s such a tiny piece of code: produce a string to export, and read a string to import. The developers of ArcDPS had to do it the hard way without access to the actual code for implementation and they managed to do it...
---
There’s really no reason for this to have been hard to implement. And even if it is, it does not require more than a week to implement. Years is just ridiculous. GW2 is full of complexity. If this simple a system took years to complete, they wouldn’t be releasing GW2 until 2145.
---
Season 2 isn't super worth it. 3,4, and 5 will all give you new maps and stuff to earn, 2 is a bit of "meh", but it leads to HoT story-wise
---
all i could think of is rorschach dammit, lol looks dope though, happy birthday!
---
Well that escalated quickly!  XD
---
Yum
