What kind of shirts are you wearing?
---
Are they guild shirts?
---
---
---
And what you don't see is that reducing everything in the game to a gold grind eventually just leads to the game being boring.
---
Guy on the far right with long hair looks like Vanya from AFK.

It's on the table

As far as I'm concerned your replies are fairly balanced even if I don't always agree with them.  You're usually not particularly sarcastic either which is a huge plus in my book.  I can have a conversation with you where we disagree about things, but don't walk away from it exceptionally bitter. It's people that misrepresent and generalize opinions like [Hinawarden](https://imgur.com/a/6e0MMzD) that really get under my skin.  Every so often when a thread is declining you get a snapshot of what people are really like when they feel no one is watching.
---

---
The reason that threads like mine blow up is because the community needs those sorts of AMA release valves for reassurance.  I don't enjoy writing them the slightest bit, and I almost always delete them when I think the conversation has run its course.  Something I've had to accept is that feelings aren't always fair and bottling them up is far worse for mental health.  I think it's far worse for the community to "stew" than it is to voice opinions and feelings that people are saying but are too afraid to say.   
---
Maybe it sounds stupid to you, but I'm satisfied if I can provoke some sort of response or reaction.  On some level I know that it's irresponsible to do, but I feel like ArenaNet is content to coast from episode to episode with as little communication as possible.  I want them to be more assertive and have answers for the playerbase.  8/30 is the end of the line.
---
Great great post, man I wish I could upvote you a 1000 times
---
Holding CC in raids is not same as burst rotations in fractals. Because of how different the two are. In fractals the CC is part of your damage rotation, because it directly increases your damage. There are classes that will weave the CC inside damage and there are classes that'll first spam CC then dmg skills.
---
Especially in a top tier group, you'll need to know exactly how much CC you need for each bar and communicate that so there is no excess CC being used which hinders next phase's bar or the dps you do on this one.
---
Raids and fractals are no comparable in this scale. I don't mean to belittle you by this but i don't think you've done fractals in a level where you can understand the difference if you can compare them this way.
---
Well you seem pretty reasonable and your responses seem pretty reasonable, so I guess this conversation is over. My own reactions come more from my own personal experience than my need to defend Anet. I'm sort of like this in every aspect of my life in everything that I do. It's probably a character flaw, but it's MY character flaw dammit. lol
---
I don't expect others not to vent. Others shouldn't expect me not to call out hyperbole. Other than that, I don't take any of this stuff personally.
---
Where do I begin...this lovely site has a list of pretty good ideas!
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Player_versus_Player
---
Rip me for not having any expansions and therefore no trading
---
Solo isn't really recommended, given that the Legendary Vinetooth leads off combat with an attack that picks a player and instantly downs them.
---
3-5 people?  Definitely.
---
Yeah I forgot you only had the first two slots at level 2 so yeah it would get really boring.
---
And their pets. And their houses.
---
they could even reward additional skins in living world chapters. Like, they still get money because some will have to buy the chapters, but at least then we'd have some sort of alternate skin from PvE (or any non gemstore exclusive)
---
Gemstore only stuff is gemstore only, you should accept that. 
---
And making mount skins a raid reward (even if it's only one) would be the worst way to make them "available" ingame.
---
You should specify what game mode you're going to be focusing on (PvP, WvW, PvE, Fractals, Raids, ~~Role Playing~~ (/s))
---
Funnily enough I personally liked the ending sequence of the original story more than any other part of the story we've gotten since. To me it's the only part in the story with a bit of emotional impact.
---
I'll only post negatively if they don't reveal anything new that we don't know. The worst timeline would be telling us everything we know is coming would be coming at some undefined time. 
---
Like if they mention alliances, they better say a date. Otherwise it's just repeating old info and not hype at all.
---
Note the difference between "hoping" and "expecting". I expect next to nothing. I hope to be presently surprised!
---
**Elite specializations**. It's been nearly two years since PoF launched, roughly the same delay between it and HoT. Elite specs give new options to every player, regardless of their preferred game mode, and if we don't get them with LS5 we can reasonably assume it'll be another two years. I'll be **very** disappointed if a new round of elite specs aren't announced.
---
**WvW updates**. Alliances are well-overdue, for a start, but frankly I think WvW needs more drastic changes than what's effectively a matchmaking update. When the community has no faith in the "core of the mode", namely capturing and defending objectives, then there's a fundamental flaw that needs to be addressed.
---
**End-game content**. Raids remain difficult for new players to enter, while veterans are frustrated with 9-10 months between content releases. Wing 7 came out to much fanfare... but then lacked challenge, with organized teams beating not only normal mode but also _challenge mode_ within hours of release. Seriously, _challenge mode_ should actually be hard, but these CMs were barely more difficult than the core encounters, and after defeating the CMs the only goal left is to replay the raids on normal difficulty each week. Fractals are similarly neglected, with over 6 months between new fractal releases. Open world content is nice, don't get me wrong, but I want something more than an incentive to auto-attack a boss and yell at people for failing a mechanic, and the actually challenging PvE content has been painfully neglected.
---
**Future plans**. This is probably the big one. We've heard precious little out of ArenaNet since the layoffs. We've got plenty of dissatisfaction in the community with the current pacing and content delivery, and what we currently know about the future of the game can be summed up as "more of the same", which just isn't going to cut it.
---
Honestly, this is one of my pet peeves with Anet. They really don't know how to link in-game rewards with playing the game.
---
a thing that doesn't get brought up very often is that jackal also has a shallower arc to its jump by nature of the fact it's actually teleporting forward and falling a bit before you trigger the next one.  this plus the fact you can keep using it in the air means if you're making a big jump the raptor is just falling helplessly and losing out on more and more potential distance
---
Pve
---
Theres a huge metal vibe in this pic lol. Great gathering for sure :)
---
Given that votes have happened...
---
Obligatory reply.
---
personally I waited until the very end and only completed maps that came up in the core story, then went back and did everything i was never guided into.
---
Hi, I've recently picked up fractal Cms and run them as an alacrigade, One of the issues im concerned about is the responsibilities I'm expected to carry out, could someone help me figure out what I'm supposed to be working towards. Any resources regarding Alacrigade expectations would be great!
---
I can't tell for PoF (don't own it), but original game story was pretty bad. Story is not just what is "written", it's also how it is presented. Some puppet threatre show like dialoges are ... well... on the level of 1980s videogames?
---
Characters are bland, lack personality/character. It has improved with the LS after HoT, but it's still far from other videogames. Anet has given characters more personality (sometimes a bit too stereotype, but many games/animes/books do so. See harry potter, poor little orphan so everyone feels sorry for him and sympathizes with him. And ofc is his foster family cartoonish evil. So that's ok.)
---
GW2 was even with "after HoT LS" not good at creating a story arc, building up tension etc. A story is not just bullet points, it's not just 1.) frodo found a ring
---
2.) frodo dropped it into a volcano
---
3.) the end
---
That's not how a good story is told. A good story is also how the story is told, about details, about characters, relationsships, inner conflicts, character development, tension/excitement and so on.
---
Movies and videogames don't need to "write" all of this down, don't need to directly say it. They can use pictures, music etc. as a medium. GW2 sucks when it comes to presentation. On paper lots of happy or sad stuff is happening in GW2s story, on paper is some stuff building up tension etc. In reality it's mostly bland because it's poorly presented, hasted, has no long term effects.
---
What I'd love is optional subscription containing bunch of QoL bonuses, so that you can feel better playing the game you like BUT could as well play it free as it is now. For example, bonus log-in chests at the end of each week, +10% rank points in pvp/wvw, unlimited harvesting tools, stuff that's not required but nice to have.
---
Ehhh 99%? thats a bit of a strech, i love gw's lore but tye story is servicable, great is an overstatement. Deff agree with nike that the dragons are boring and the story is too safe.
---
You're putting too much focus on the word "deserves", perhaps I should have used a different one. What I mean to say is, if you're so incredibly brain dead that you would a player named "G NN" for an Anet employee, and they successfully get you to hand over login-details etc, then the loss of your account for this game is a severe enough lesson to teach you not to be so naive in the future. It is just a game account after all. It's not like I'm saying it's a good or moral thing that someone scams you out of your life savings for instance.
---
Just play ff14.
---
You are 100% right - just checked my build and it is Deceptive Evasion within the Dueling trait.     
---
     
---
Thanks!
---
They didn't ask about choosing between a heal tempest and a scourge. They asked if a a scourge was *allowed*.
---
Obviously my answer would be definitely different if they presented different choices of healers and asked which one was better.
---
True. But that responsibility is also on their trainer. Any decent trainer would explain what happened and why it happened. And yeah it depends on the trainee if they absorbed it or not.
---
Depends on the player. If you go down, die and don't learn from it or you go down, get rezzed and don't learn from it.. why blame the scourge instead of the noob?
---
1. I have a [section for it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Gold_Farming), it's not a complete list but goes over the main ones. For repeatable dargonfall is by far the best option, otherwise there are a lot of good daily events and things like fractals.
---
2. Yes, it's one of the other reasons dragonfall is so good. [Check this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) for a more complete list on how and where to get gear. It's mainly the mounts and ascended trinkets (and the maps/story), they also added in new fractals and raids during season 4 but those are in the base game/expansion now.
---
3. [Discretize](https://discretize.eu/) is a little out of date on some builds now but is still one of the best fractal resources. [Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/) is your go to for raids. There are also some great starter guides out there. [Pory wrote one for fractals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bt-vFeeLAeEsaoz72bkc4ZODsudIQ2hiQdvSnFYLtw/preview#) and [Tevatron has a raid guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7zlH3pVPvW21WIh5-qL-IXDeABtJzIqnZYXP8tCcM0). I also have a [basic raid intro](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Raid_Guide) but I'm in the process of updating it now since it's out of date.
---
4. TacO/BlishHUD are both great and can use Tekkit's resource pack. GW2Efficiency also has a [gathering guide](https://gw2efficiency.com/gathering/permanent-nodes) for the permanent nodes. I have a broader [overview of possible add-ons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Add-ons) too.
---
5. Magic find only matters for getting the gear drops in the first place, opening them is not effected. It's always best to open them then [salvage](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Salvaging)/sell the gear you get. I suggest putting the gear in an invisible bag or shared slot and opening all while having an item that you can deposit or consume so that you don't fill all the way up.
---
6. Depends on for what content, [Wooden Potatoes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUY9_i44IDNOs_Ja815mlA) always has new content otherwise I don't follow many creators. Some for specific content or guides.
---
u mean u dont enjoy farming for gold to vuy your stuff? shocking.
---
This doesn't really feel like a reply to the comment you replied to...
---
That's what she gets for not wearing the standard issued uniform helmet ;)
---
dT's [renegade build](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/hybrid-renegade) goes over a lot of what you want to do in general but their [fractal guides](https://discretize.eu/fractals/shattered-observatory) still need to be updated. You can check out the videos they posted of their runs or ask them on [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/r5Qhf4) for more details.
---
This isn't just true for mount skins, outfits have also ruined customization and cosmetics in the game. Everything cool is reserved for the gemstore and we rarely get anything if ever that is decent looking that is merit based. Gw2 players are too used to pulling out their wallets for vanity, which is party why i feel this game never appealed to traditional MMO players, especially WoW players.
---
Ideally yes, but core experience and items are worthless to pretty much all experienced players by now.
---
Haven't heard of anything like that, at all. Can you find a source for it?
---
It's not about money, it's about sending a message.
---
Having no mount skin as an ingame reward is just greedy.
---
The game needed the trinity as much as people acted like it didnt. the entire gameplay loop of an encounter just ended up being "zerg it down, res and run back". That wasnt really that fun.
---
Yea it's a bit of an exaggeration, but the vast majority of games don't attempt anything beyond a series of events. GW2 has actually had some pretty consistent themes across its 3 main arcs:
---
The personal story was all about strength through unity, pretty much every moment is about bringing disparate threads and groups together and keeping them together (even including the actual story tree itself, which gradually resolves into a single thread for the final act). 
---
The LS2-HoT-LS3 era was all about betrayal and civil conflict. Starting with revealing the internal strife within the Sylvari, and I think HoT was intended to be about the distrust between the other races and the Sylvari (though this got cut due to time constraints). LS3 follows these themes with the return of the white mantle and the fractures appearing in Dragon's Watch.
---
PoF-LS4 meanwhile has been about loss. The plot kicks off with Rytlock losing his sword, then carries on through the loss of Vlast and the gods, the Awakened's loss of Joko, Zafirah's loss of Balthazar, and our (brief) loss of Aurene. It actually quite neatly ties in with the first season, with people dealing with their loss with the help of their allies and ultimately the power of hope.
---
To me that elevates it above the majority of games, even if there are low moments.
---
Good, gives me content to find more skips. Game needs content. I'll just find skips the same day they patch those in if they even do anything. Though these skips have been posted before with other mounts over. a year ago and they haven't been changed in the slightest.
---
A better solution would be to tie most JPs to an adventure system and get rid dismount zones. It's a win win for everyone if they did that.
---
This entire game is about cosmetics since best in slot gear is so easy to get.
---
There are videogames with good storytelling (as example the final fantasy titles). GW2s story is bad because of above meantioned problems. It's not a technical problem, it's ..well...incompetence? a different focus on other game aspects?
---
My fix would probably make the situation worse ...
---
I'd suggest you to do dungeon to get your self a full set of exotic gear from the dungeon vendor with dungeon tokens. CoF, Citidal of Flames, could be a nice start for zerker armour if you plan to go to the Reaper route. Use a Axe mainland and dagger mainland for power necro.
---
Sadly not all trainers or trainees are decent.
---
We already have two account bound exclusive chair skins from raids. What's your opinion on that?
---
I don't speak Portuguese, but that's some amazing effort and it looks really good for a fan made guide!
---
Ahh actually after looking around I think I had a combination of things said previously(about tournaments returning) and WvW seasons(which will use the system as current) jumbled up together.
---
Well my point wasn't really about excusing GW2s writing - I certainly don't think the final fantasy games can really claim to be amazing fiction, even if the stories are good for games.
---
My point was that the story in most games doesn't really respect the medium. Many games are happy to have gameplay sections, and push all the story into cutscenes (or similar). Even if the stories were on the level of the best literature, they aren't telling the story through gameplay.
---
GW2 at least tries to blend the two, and I think technical limitations do come into play there (for example, the need to fit an arc into the amount of gameplay they can produce with their 9 month development time).
---
They better if they want us logging in for 7 more years
---
Agreed. It's pretty damn awesome - I love it when a system rewards mastery like it does (especially pre-nerf).
---
Anyway, wish y'all the best!
---
Does anyone know who the girl with the white hair was? She's gorgeous..
---
Daredevil with Staff
---
It's good for AoE as well, which is much more useful in Open World than single-target rifle Deadeye or daggers.

I set it for heavy armor looks, but you can change it to Medium or Light with the drop down menu at the top.
---
It'd be fine if only trainees weren't decent, because that's understandable. They're trying to learn so nothing's expected of them except the willingness to learn.
---
Trainers on the other hand, yikes. If they're questionable then it's just gonna spread bad habits to the people they're trying to "teach".

* new fully staffed raid team

---
hmmmm salty. heal scourge is a crutch and adds a res bot support and mechanics skip. thats about all it brings. so if youre running it to make training as easy as you can by skipping mechanics, then yes it hurts training because people dont follow the actual fight mechanics and just know they get rescued.
---
That’s a really good point. I think that requiem armor (other than the nullification fiasco) was a step in the right direction. I for one made it as soon as the price on the sigils dropped. But it still stands true that most of the really flashy items in this game come from obscene amounts of gold or obscene amounts of gems, both of which incentivize people to buy gems.
---
I think a good solution for this would be to add ig-earnable mount skins to the loot pool of some bosses,  f.e. tequatl or raidbosses. 
---
Of course it couldn't be the same ones as in the gem store but i think this system could work quite well If implemented right!
---
There's a difference between what happens in the story and how it happens. I feel like, generally, the things that happen are really cool. However, I feel like ANet struggles in making the "how" compelling.
---
Take *One Path Ends,* for example. The idea of teaming up with a 250-year-old necromancer and exploring Orr to revive Lazarus and finally end the mursaat is a good idea for a story. However, we got painful dialogue, inconsistent tone throughout, and a really poorly-paced climax that made everything feel underwhelming beyond measure.
---
We could have been a genuinely interesting story that dove into the final mysteries of the mursaat and uncovered some secrets in Orr, eventually letting us put an ancient story arc to rest. Instead, we got what is largely regarded as the worst story episode ever. Not because of *what* happened, but *how* it happened.
---
Verbal abuse getting regularly and impactfully actioned.
---
Get rid of duoq, it's ruined the competitive aspect of spvp. Ranked 2v2s, ranked soloq, and automated tournaments. Focus on those three modes and balance, then on drawing players back with better rewards. Zero the accounts of people who manipulated the matchmaker this season.
---
Honestly in gw2 I'm like, "this dye is not the *exact* shade I need to complement my other dyes" and spend another 5 minutes rearranging outfit
---
irl: "Shirt? Check. Pants? Sure."
---
I am pretty sure Stronghold would've become more popular had we had build templates.
---
🐳
---
Probably condi weaver. Condi burnzerker is good too, especially for support as a bannerslave.
---
It’s been open for years.
---
Fewer match manipulators in ranked.
---
So you swap to your build in that one template slot and can't swap back to what you had before. So yeah, 1 slot is largely useless.
---
Hahaha, it'd be nice if I could enjoy it man! This was my first season in any MMO's PvP and I walked away from each session in a worse mood than I had came in with. Managed to snag a Top 250 and a title, but that'll be the last time I return ranked in this game and unranked will be solely for some quick dailies if I'm desperate.
---
I dunno man, the whole thing just felt corny for some reason. I never felt any satisfaction from killing another player in this game, and only immense frustration when I died. When I play an FPS game, every kill feels like I just tossed a chip into my mouth - I can't wait to eat another. In this game? Everything just felt sour and I've for sure had enough.
---
I'm so unsure cause on the wiki, it shows it closed off
---
I mean, I guess we use the word "deserve" differently? To me, it's more of a moral, prescriptive statement on how a person _should_ be treated given certain circumstances, whereas to you it's about the expected reward or punishment dealt to the person given these circumstances.
---
And well, we can indeed expect that people who are susceptible to being scammed, probably will be scammed. And people who do get scammed probably will be able to learn something from it - not to say that the scammer is actually doing a good thing.
---
And if that's what you're saying, then yes, I agree with that.
---
I just think that "deserve" carries a little more moral weight than simply describing expected outcomes, that's all :)
---
So you would be happy with 3?  And monetising extras despite previously saying you don't think it should be monetised.
---
More minor tweaks to balance at quicker intervals.  Its not fun going into a 1v1 knowing the other player has a better chance than you.  Even if you're the better player, the balance is in their favor.
---
This for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrQQ9BHEstI
---
Life is a trial, Koda the judge, and Kodan the jury.
---
OP shouldn’t go above Fractal level 20. Not without Tears of Alba anyways (which I’m pretty sure you need HoT for anyways). In regards to dungeons, I’d go for the more regularly run/ easier ones like AC, CoF p1, TA (not Aether), SE p1/p3, and *maybe* Arah p1. Maybe. Probably not.
---
 Nope. A lot of the builds on metabattle are outdated, so I’d advise OP to use Snowcrows instead. They’re raid builds, but they can be tailored for open-world PvE easily enough.
---
They're not obliged to help you, but it's a dick move.
---
Healing scourge isn’t meta for any raid encounters afaik, but it can be pretty OP in easier fights like in fractals/dungeons. There should be a build for it on Snowcrows.
---
Kyosika, CommonTate, and King V O X all did pretty good noob guides if OP doesn’t mind watching a few YT videos.
---
Why don’t they just add a 2v2, 1v1, 3v3 where you don’t fight over a point. Recycle the maps, who gives a shit, but some classes excel at fighting on points better than others.
---
[https://imgur.com/vhtbZJz](https://imgur.com/vhtbZJz)  
---
One of the looks I'm most proud of.
---
They're probably more popular than WvW or PvP but you don't see people getting shot down for hoping those modes get some love too.
---
I’m surprised they didn’t ask you to delete it, and then replace it. I’ve run into a few issues where I chose the wrong thing from a birthday gift, or selected the wrong stats after the recent reset, and they just had me delete the item, then a replacement showed up after confirming.
---
Pretty much why I stopped caring about skins... Most of the skins released are in the gem store since HoT pretty much. I won't buy any glider or mount skin in the gem store. The fact there's a VERY limited set of gliders (legendaries only) and no mount skin acquirable in-game pisses me off. I don't mind if there are quite a bunch of skins or outfits in the gem store, if there are a few that can be gotten only by playing the game.
---
They should seriously release a bunch of mount skins and gliders with different look and dye channels for the base game. Could be in festivals, new maps, unlocked with HoT/PoF currencies, collections, etc.
---
Farming gold sucks and I would rather never do that ever again so I've been skipping on pretty much all new skins.
---
FFXIVs PVE is much better and i have played GWQ2 for 6 and a half years and still do WvW and have been playing FFXIV since just before the release of Heavensward. 
---
For a new player like you GW2 is brilliant lots to do and I will say the combat is great especially for pvp and wvw, but it is also true that these game modes are mostly ignored and the pve living world patches that come every 3-4 months which i still do every time give me about 4 hrs worth of content. 
---
Previously I would of said GW2 is a better game but it definitely isn't now and hasn't been for a while. Let me know how you feel when you have actually dedicated a long time to it and realize that for Vet players there really is not much to do at all. The main issue is player retention, they have new players of course but they cant seem to keep there long time player base. this is sad because this game has so much potential.
---
WvW is great and I would definitely hop in and try that out no other game comes close to a game mode like it, but i recommend doing it casually because it is great fun but balance is bad and Anet doesn't actually care about the game mode.
---
Wow I nailed it. When I saw him I inmediately thought "That guy looks like an argentinian" (I live there :p)
---
I asked that, they said that won't work, ill post the ticket in a bit
---
Which is an upgrade which is still a loot treadmill.. it’s just a slow as fuck treadmill.
---
I think the reason it doesn’t is possibly because the storage has a limit on supplies. Could be wrong though
---
Why is it so hard to add non gemstore Mount skins?
---
Just chuck them as RNG drops on the metas with a drop rate like the invisible boots.
---
You could even lock certain ones to certain metas. People will grind this sort of thing like for the infusions.
---
I’m shocked too. How hard is it to re-colour an existing skin or tweak one and chuck it in the loot table?
---
Then, go to another starting area, you have different themes... sylvari with plants and jungle, charr with metal and ruins, asura with technology and science, humans with normal things I guess.
---
Each have their own amazing sights.
---
If you find hearts boring, skip them! You do NOT have to do them. Your focus should be on exploration, killing yellow mobs (more XP for the longer they haven't been killed) and finding events (use map chat if you see one/ask for events). If you see a commander icon, it might be an indication of events going on at that place. Do not hesitate to use map chat!
---
Leveling might not be your thing, but do not worry, the game gets a lot more interesting once you reach 80. You just have to persevere. Try to find people to party with to explore / finish map completions (if that's your thing). You will have to finish quite a bunch of maps to reach 80 though, but make it worth your time by finding fun events throughout your exploration. Take note of events you like.
---
I still remember an event I would farm non-stop at the release of the game. People barely do it anymore as we have 3 times the content nowadays, but you might find some really sweet events that repeats often enough!
---
There isn't that much gear treadmill in the game, but there are a ton of end-game stuff to work towards (fractals, legendaries, rare collections, common collections, skins unlock, achievements, raids, wvw, pvp, having 1 character of each class, having map completion on all toons, etc.

But yes, there's no reason to not switch landscape! Definitely do it! You shouldn't go in a zone that's 2 levels higher than you or more though since you won't be gaining more XP for killing higher level mobs. But you can definitely go in lower level maps and you'll be gaining the same amount of XP. So you could do all 5 level 1-15 maps to get to level XY. Or you could move on to the next zone when you are about 5 levels into the next zone requirements I'd say. If you are too low, you might get confronted with higher level monsters that won't give you much XP, so I would recommend you have some XP already before going around a new higher level map.
---
Good luck!
---
Heck, I feel like we should be able to move NPCs around in guild halls. We should be able to.
---
I seriously love Path of Exile's hideout system. I've never seen something as well done as it. You can move pretty much anything (other than the original map terrain) and remove default doodads. Then you can customize with new decorations, move them, turn them, import a hideout from someone's export (provided you have pre-purchased all decorations needed though).
---
There should seriously be smaller guildhalls that feel like a home instance you can customize and upgrade.
---
Ooh good idea.
---
Are you like, actually insane or just being paid by ArenaNet? This is the most ridiculous hill to die on lmao
---
Hopefully, the Mac client has run very poorly since OpenGL was deprecated. I’d love to see them swap to a Metal translation latter (pretty sure that even though it’s now a native binary, they’re still running GFX as DX9 to OpenGL).
---
Or if we get armor is usually just another set of gloves or another helmet.
---
I'm not saying they need to make full sets... But... IDK. Something? Surely they could figure something. I might not mind if the gem store was just filled with 2000 gem mount skins to the brim. But having ANOTHER set of gloves or ANOTHER crown/mask is just... So what?
---
I do like the NPC packages as well. Armors, outfits and weapon skins in the gem store. They just seem like gem store stuff. "Hey get these exotic reskins for your favorite mounts, gliders and look like your favorite NPCs!" It's what 90% of games did charge real money for. But for items like the new great sword, that could've been an in-game collection.
---
It's pretty clear you never played in 2013, when finishers were gemstore only. But go ahead, keep thinking that those that weren't the default ranking finishers were always available via non-purchaseable-or-limited time means.
---
In surprised they didn't just tell u to delete the item and they would send u a new one. I would certainly train contacting them again or getting a dev here to respond to the issue. 
---
A while back someone delete their kodas warmth enrichment and support said they wouldn't replace it but a dev here got it sorted and sent them one. Additionally I had a friend who made 90% of quip and realised he didn't want quip, and support broke down all the mats and returned them to the base state so he could choose a different leggy.
---
Personally find support to be quite helpful, and IV contacted them alot over the past few years. Really hope u get it resolved.
---
Sounds like this mastery would wreck havoc any time I want materials in my inventory, like like if I'm crafting, using the Mystic Forge, selling off mats, etc. Or if I'm farming specific materials and I don't want to keep going back to a banker to check if I've actually gotten any.
---
At that point you'd need an option to turn the feature off, and the Inventory Options menu would be the most sensible place to put it... The whole thing sounds frustrating and redundant.
---
Because that's such a stupid useless thing to post in a vacuum. It's like me saying that I'm going to put pants on in the morning. No one just narrates their fucking day. When I read things online, I interpret them to have a meaning beyond describing the literal state of events. Otherwise, what's the fucking point of posting that? Do you realize just how much time you've wasted in this thread because you want to be special and pretend that other people are weird for not assuming that you're narrating the literal facts of life? What absolute moron comes into a thread and says "God, I have to do more of X" and expects people to assume that he's describing the literal actions he'll have to take in the immediate future? Are you off your fucking rocker, man?
---
"**God**, I **have** to play (so?) **much** more WvW to get all these skins. All I ever did was to get **the damn** backpack. And maybe a skin or two of its light armour set."
---
Your post with words emphasized that communicated to me that you were exasperated at the prospect of playing WvW. What sort of fucking broken emotionless robot reads that post as you describing your day? "I MUST PLAY WVW TO GET THESE NEW SKINS. PREVIOUS INTERACTIONS RESULTED IN A BACKPACK AND EITHER ONE OR TWO LIGHT ARMOR SKINS." What is the fucking **point** of posting that? You can't get any discussion or interesting insight. Because, like you said, you're literally just describing what you will have to do and what you have done in the past. If you actually WERE upset at having to play WvW to get the skins, then there's an actual potential for discussion and ideas. That's why my response was noting that you have an alternative means of getting the skins. Because that's an actual discussion with insights players might not have. In short, myself and other people interpreted your post as complaining about WvW because that's the only way that it had any fucking value besides doing the equivalent of telling us when you're going to put on your pants. No one's arguing semantics. We're all just so confident in the human species that we can't fathom that someone would be as stupid as you. We're all sitting behind our keyboards thinking "surely, he's not that much of a fucking moron. Surely his post is meant for something other than a list of things he has done and will do in the future. Surely he wrote his post intending to get actual discussion going!"
---
I swear to God. Are you insane? Are you actually, genuinely, meant to be on medication? I'm 100% serious. I would go on but I'm so genuinely disgusted with the amount of everyone's time that you've wasted for your narcissistic power trip that I can't even bother at this point.
---
Button mashing is also just trash gameplay, you still just look at fucking icons to lose the greyed out state.
---
Ffs you're being disingenious, the actual skillful part of this game is poisitioning and dodging, not mashing buttons.
---
&gt; So you say I'm plain wrong, and then process to confirm exactly what I said. 
---
Which is also not true, you were implying that the attacks were identitcal and the attacks were initially backloaded on effects/damage, which just isn't the case. That's the whole thing I was arguing about.
---
Your wording continuously makes it seem as though it wasn't before, but then they changed it to be that way, which just is not the case. Your wording is exactly the reason why I argued those points.
---
&gt; (\*) well anyway you apparently didn't read my comment either ... 
---
I do read the bullshit you're coming up with, but apparently you're not aware of how you're wording your bullshit.
---
&gt; Also you use a pretty biased vocabulary  
---
Same goes fucking back to you, as you're coming from a standpoint that just assumes it's an inherently unskillful design, you're completely dismissing the idea of kowledge being part of skill. Which leads me to:
---
&gt; skill != knowledge 
---
Disagreed. They are inherently intertwined. Actual skill is a combination of knowledge and mechanical skill.  If you think that's not the case, *I'm afraid you're delusional.*
---
&gt; but sometimes I just don't bother  
---
Like I said, I'm not going to argue that aa chains are good gamedesign in terms of 'fun', if your only problem is that you're bored out of your mind watching flipping icons, that's fair enough. Doesn't mean that apparently people still have a problem incorporating their aa chains into their rotation. You know what's also boring? Mashing your other skills off cooldown, but hey, that apparently seems to be extremely delightful to you.
---
Then they should definitely be able to do something. He should escalate the ticket.
---
um, 3 words: fuck you lol
---
I've replied them with an idea from another comment about placing the weapon and the sigil on my unused toon and deleting it. That way, I won't unlock the skin I think, and they can mail me another one back.
---
&amp;#x200B;

Waiting on their reply right now.
---
This guide along with the dragon bash event where you could get a bunch of currencies every week, are the sole reason why I bothered to finish this MFKING BULLSHIT OVER COMPLECATED FOR NO GOOD FKING REASON Collection.

It did cost 500g but I paid it gladly to skip all the BULLSHIT placed in it just to waste my MFKING time.
---
To ANET: NEVER EVER FUCKING DO THIS CONVOLUTED PIECE OF SHIT EVER AGAIN, WHENEVER YOU THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO DO SHIT LIKE THIS
---
**DO US ALL A FAVOR: HIT YOURSELF IN THE BALLS REALLY REALLY HARD REPEATEDLY 1ST**
---
Lack of support from anet, groups and guilds logging off because they wiped once, too many casuals unwilling to make themselves better etc etc, basically right now it’s blob up or don’t play
---
Oh man. One thing I've learned over the last decade is you can't ever point out any flaws from Elder Scrolls games or the mob will bust out of their caves with pitchforks. Which is incredibly difficult to do, because there's very few good things to say about them.
---
&gt; ...what's the best Constant dmg output...
---
Every dps build in the game fits this description. Unless you are talking about best dps with out pressing all the buttons. If thats the case dont bother with the "best" and play something you like and can perform decent on.
---
Thank you! It took some doing, but it was a fun side project and I'm very pleased with the result, heheh. :)
---
Oh ... hah, that's ... ok, I don't even know what to say. I really thought that was a bug. 
---
Thanks for clarifying.
---
Thanks.
---
where is this?
---
Haha yeah good tip. Thanks.
---
Thank you.
---
I see.
---
&gt;I just think that "deserve" carries a little more moral weight than simply describing expected outcomes, that's all :)
---
Good to know semantic arguments will still be had between strangers on the internet in 2019.
---
I just want deposit materials to have its own button.
---
And during reset you get skill lag which makes it unplayable unless you're escorting dolyaks.
---
Heh. True
---
that will make gathering data from Iding and salvaging much much much harder, and what when you do that in bigger scale, and 2k mat storage gets filled in 2 min. It will make no difference.
---
*Insert heavy voice*
---
I had him for a while but he looks a lot better with those shoulder pads! I knew I should get around to unlocking all the dungeon stuff haha
---
They most probably will, the thing is that theyre not going to have more people on raids or fractals because it's not something a casual touches
---
Ask for a different gm in support, some are quite useless.
---
Yeah I know but I'm just tired of seeing "we need more people" in maptchat when it only scales up any event.
---
Repeatable CMs mostly cater small hardcore playerbase of this game. I would love to have repatable normal raids, that would encourage veterans to help newbies with raids when they are done with weekly clear.
---
No kidding, it has gotten so bad 3 way smc fight in t1-t2 NA aren’t even possible
---
What timezone do you play? Certain timezones have very few people playing, also depends on your server
---
Anet is to blame for this and Anet is to blame for that. Yeah, sorry, correction, it would be NCSoft who would have Anet's head if they started decreasing revenue from the gem store. They already had their lump of flesh when they fired employees their employees earlier this year, even is that was just an excuse to have *greater* control over ArenaNet's development priorities (Hint: NCSoft is a major mobile developer and they recently all but admitted they were working on a mobile release for the Guild Wars franchise). There's a reason why the gem store looks so much like other NCSoft NCoin stores.
---
Nah, that happens with "deposit all" as well. It would just automatically fill to the max cap and leave the remaining mats in inventory. Just like auto loot works now :)
---
I'm not taking literary criticism from someone who can't be bothered to hit spellcheck.
---
You assume everyone will rant or joke about broken mesmers? I mean... Most people generally want to group up so that we can easily track where people are attacking or defending. Kind of impossible to do that without seeing the map dots, or at least basic communication. Not sure where you're getting the rest from but do you I guess...
---
Well, technically we have it now, with legendary runes and sigils. It's just extremely expensive. I do wish PvP system would be used everywhere, but I don't think Anet is willing to give up all the material/crafting treadmill regular users are supposed to run daily until exhaustion. We only get PvP to be "any stats you want for, like, 5 golds tops" because of that previous "eeeeee-spoooooorts!" era.
---
The problems are on different layers as as I can see it.
---
You have players quit the content because they got bored, they don't have anything to do, they don't have anyone to play with or they don't like that ArenaNet has shown much support for the content or expected it to be more.
---
Players moved to higher populated worlds because their world they were on (and joined because they didn't know or didn't want to play initially or friends were on that world) wasn't active anymore or never really to begin with. But WvW is a content that requires a population and, at best, the same population not only on your world but also on the other world and, more importantly, have a similar strength AND day and night coverage but matching Worlds against each other based on those criteria is probably not something you will be able to in any good way. That is what alliance could fix, hopefully.
---
Which means, you could be on a world from which players are not interested in WvW and just want to get their Dailies or some duels done because most have moved to higher populated worlds to be able to get better matches.
---
To state the opposite to your situation, I'm on a world that is active in WvW and there are a lot of players playing, Commanders lead different maps and urge players to join the voice chats. people talk to each other on those maps but generally content specific things like sightings of enemies, call for help etc.
---
its all light requem armor besides the shoulders obv.

---
Deadeye, pistol pistol. Make sure you have the trait that heals you for part of your damage , use all your unloads. ez everything. Except mobs with reflects.
---
I still think repeatable CMs cater too small portion of playerbase. Do I think CMs should have better rewards? Absolutely. Should they be repetable? No, because then veterans will just make even more elitist groups to just farm them, that's your own argument. They should imo have better weekly reward than normal mode, but that's enough. Right now there is no point doing raids besides weekly clear, so even small reward would encourage veterans to do them instead of forming elitist group to sell those (if people still buys them, havent played in a long time). There have to be diminishing returns, noone probably wants CoF farm days back.

berserker is recommended tho.
---
Which should be full. When are you playing?
---
Thank you!
---
Nothing has changed in the monetization of the game. It has always been about certain convenience items and fashion wars. That's where GW2 makes its money. You were willing to pay as long as you enjoyed the content. But after thousands of hours, you are through said content. And you have lost interest in the game. Which really isn't surprising. But instead of realizing this, you jump on the first thing you notice and blame that for everything.
---
You can read the exact same criticisms in pretty much every MMO. Because players are unwilling to accept, that maybe games can't provide all they wish.
---
You were clear and he replied appropriately. He’s saying that the dodges are just straight up upgrades over thief’s regular dodges.
---
The CMs are currently being made anyway and the additional resources used for things like extra models (Qadim the Peerless) and entirely new programing routines in an encounter (Ender's Echo) aren't utilised very well. At the moment they are, for the majority of players, a one and done kind of thing.
---
A repeatable CM should be repeatable either weekly or, in my opinion, alongside the Call of the Mists and the rewards should not be the same as the first kill. This limits the repetition to, at most, once a week. You agree with this, which is the proposal myself and many others have put forward countless times on this sub, so I honestly thought it was common knowledge that allowing repetition for the full reward is a bad idea. Perhaps I should have spelt that out. I'd suggest additional rewards more in line with Environmentally Friendly and Seimur Was Wrong. 
---
As you note, you haven't played in a while. It's more common for people that do weekly clears either to help out for the sake of just getting more people into raiding (that's how my training runs are) or to use an alt account than sell things. 
---
Speaking from the perspective of someone who clears and then does weekend training, I'd happily forsake additional rewards for easy modes of other bosses. It'd be better for both my interest, and that of the people that join for casual runs, if it wasn't consistently doing the easier bosses over and over again with only the occasional easy end boss.
---
Please not, this would be super annoying.
---
How convenient, you just erased “on the issue” right?
---
I personally think normal mode is easy enough (though 5 and 6 are much more difficult than 4) - which is why I want relatable CMs. However, I'm not representative of the player base.
---
There are still plenty of people that I raid casually with, and in a training capacity, who struggle with normal mode encounters and then there are swathes of the player base who don't want to even consider raiding as they see it as too difficult.
---
So I see at least three major advantages to an easier difficulty:
---
1. Remove the reliance on experienced people being required to get new people into raiding. The entire idea of training was so foreign to me from a WoW perspective but it is absolutely needed for many players due to the lack of difficulty variation.
---
2. Better use of existing content - whether or not this is more people seeing Dhuum (but on an easy mode) or raids at all, this is an advantage.  The resources being seen by more players is better for Anet and better for the sustainability of the game mode.
---
3. Introduce elements of difficulty scaffolding. Having easier wings is fine  but killing those bosses doesn't help build a players ability to understand, and get better at, Qadim or Dhuum. A scaffolding framework would be nice.
---
Yea well but ppl are still curious since it’s a big waste of Time to play pvp if it’s Not ranked
---
FA had pretty large groups when we played against them a couple of weeks ago. (We also had pretty large groups.)
---
What timezone are you on? WvW experience can be so different from timezone to timezone we might as well be on different servers sometimes.
---
I did, but not for convinience. I just thought it's unnecessary to mention, because it's no difference between "responding" and "responding on the issue". 
---
Sure, there *is* a difference, you could make an offtopic comment, like you did before your edit, but that's something people shouldn't do in general imo. Therefore (for me) -&gt; responding = responding on the issue. :)
---
What I tried to say: If you think it's not worth to respond on something, you shouldn't respond.
---
You are technically naked while mounted

Sounds like Tempest or Chronomancer or Firebrand to me. Look into those.

---
Is there a game mode you want to play in particular? PVE, WVW, , or pvp? If you want to play a support type of role on mesmer, you'll need HOT to play Chronomancer, the elite spec, and chrono died in almost all game modes. It's still alive in pve raids though, you can help extend people's boons, give some quickness and alacrity, it's more melee played this way. For ele, again, if you want to play a support style, you'll need HOT to access the tempest spec although core ele is able to provide healing.  If you really want to enjoy the game and plan on playing it for years, you'll need access to both expansions., not only for the class but also for the gear stats, runes and sigils only available from the expansions. The revenant POF elite spec, Renegade, gives some nice support by giving people alacrity and can provide heals, it's not too bad. Heal Druid is actually kinda enjoyable, but only in fractals or pve raids. You don't like the other classes, but i'll just point out that necro and guard's healing abilities are better with their PoF elites, engi scrapper with HoT in wvw and some will argue that thief can heal....
---
If you do decide to buy the xpacs soon, wait around a bit, till the end of August, Anet is currently having their anniversary sales and usually put the expacs on sale around this time.
---
Hi all returning player with acess to HoT and PoF, I'm currently leveling an Ele and had a few questions for you
---
1. I PoF seems a little easier than HoT in regards to grabbing the hero points so which elite spec should I unlock before tackling HoT? Tempest seems like its more durable and would make tackling the hero points in HoT a bit easier?
---
2. Aura's granted by the tempest trait "Unstable Conduit",  is their anyway to detonate them? Could I use staff 3 to detonate the aura from overloading earth for example?
---
Maybe the game is just not for you? But consider that to get the most out of your class button mashing is the wrong way of playing, to get the most you have to pay attention..problem is you don´t need get the most out of your profession in every part of the game, mostly in raids and t4 fractals
---
Imagine if they let you in and behind the wall was another wall.
---
I'm not "pushing and hoping for only one". OP is asking for *at least* one token skin and I'm saying that that request should not be garnering as much spite and anger as some people in this thread are giving it; that it's the bare minimum and nobody should be defending ANet *not* doing the bare minimum.  
---
Elsewhere in this thread I've commented that I'd rather *everything* was unlocked in-game and ANet monetised the game via regular expansions (like GW1) or even a subscription (like XIV) rather than the nickel-and-diming. My comment *here* is not about that, but about the other responses in this thread.
---
[removed]
---
it's literally standard procedure for them to instruct you to delete your defective/unwanted item, and them sending you a replacement, which would not unlock the skin.
---
the fact that this is even possible in the way your describe add severely to the pile of frustration i feel regarding the "customize item" UI.
---
just throw all your evidence into the ticket and ask for it to get escalated. judging by the responses you got thus far, you seem to have landed in the hands of someone rather inexperienced.
---
I think your server to s trying to avoid T1 lol.
---
About half the hero points in HoT are designed to be done with other players (~2-4) and can be brutal to try and solo. Most people wait for or set up an "HP Train" where a group will run through getting all the hero points in the HoT maps. The PoF maps have a lower total of HPs but as you found out they are all solo-able. Personally think both elite specs can do it just fine but I'd say weaver is more meta right now and would suggest getting that unlocked first (Tempest is easier to play than weaver though).
---
Auras are passive buffs that are normally gained through weapon skills (usually elementalist) or combo finishers (usually leaps). The skill that you're talking about is called "[Magnetic Aura](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magnetic_Aura)" and gives the Magnetic Aura buff. When you have the Aura buff the skill (on earth staff 3) flips over to be "[Transmute Earth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Transmute_Earth)" and lets you detonate the aura for damage, protection, and a blast finisher. You do not need to use the skill to get it to flip, it will flip any time you have the correct aura active. The flipped skill does have it's own 10 second cooldown so even if you got the aura again you have to wait till the detonate is up. So to actually answer your question, yes the detonate skills activate and flip over when you have the aura but they have a cooldown still and you'd have to have the right weapon for it ([Staff earth 3](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Transmute_Earth) uses magnetic, [Focus fire 5](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Transmute_Fire) uses fire, [dagger water 4](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Transmute_Frost) uses frost, and [dagger air 3](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Transmute_Lightning) uses shocking).

quick reply:
---
does a through pve obtained skin bring revenue? no. that's why.
---
I think this would be nice to add in as a somewhat prestigious reward for completing certain parts of the content. For example, I'd quite like mount skins associated with raids, but not too inaccessible since then they could be used to encourage new players into the game.
---
Perhaps an achievement for a mount or glider skin for each raid wing where the raid wing needs to be completed 10 times, at most once a week?
---
I'm sure there could be similar things for PvP. Something that has a small degree of prestige, is shiny and is used as a lure to get people into that game mode.
---
Aside from that, I'm generally okay with how the gem store is handled since, from a raiding perspective, there are still nice exclusive things only available through that activity such as skins and minis.
---
Tengu taste like chicken?
---
Buffs that increase attack, defense, precision etc. And not just an aoe skill that grants healing/protection
---
I am all for training runs in general and I have joined a fair share of them. All I can say about it is that I would rather get carried to see/experience all mechanic's to learn then wiping on dhuum pre for hours on end just because 1 person is too bad at doing the greens.
---
With that being said, I now have joined a nice static who does weekly clears in 2 days. I am currently transitioning into main tank and to learn it I have to trial by error most things new to me with little explanation. If there is a safety net to hang on to when I miss like an important mechanic I am grateful because I am willing to learn not needing it. Where the mentality of a lot of players is less mechanic's is more better.
---
Tl;dr
---
I like it as long as the learners are actually willing.

I think I remember catching a re-run of this on TV like... 20 years ago?

Is that the twitch prime pet?

When you run over the [Speed mushrooms](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blazing_Speed_Mushrooms) you gain the Effect [Celeritas Spores](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celeritas_Spores) which grants:
---
&gt; You move 40% faster. Skills and actions are 10% faster. Removes movement conditions. 
---
On the notes
---
&gt; The 10% boost does not stack with Quickness.
---
So quickness would overwrite it since it has 50% attack speed. Judging by that, it could be possible but so minuscule that you most of the time would not notice when you don't have Quickness on yourself.
---
i see you listed end game things like mounts and trading, which i won't be using until i will get max lvl.  
---
Can you tell me what should i get for the start of the game from the things you listed?
---
Never noticed that, that's pretty cool.
---
Thank you, I feel dumb to not have found this myself when I searched for it :(
---
Keep in mind, GW2 surprisingly demanding if you want to make it look really good.
---
Others will mention few addons, but I believe, the most important after arkdps is yolo mouse. Latest version have good looking 3D cursor (try orange version), with it you will never lose track of your cursor on the screen.
---
Get familiar with GW2Efficiency, Discord, &amp; GW2Hook and maybe GW2Tac0.
---
* GW2Efficiency - By far the most useful and streamlined API utilizing website.  It tracks pretty much everything that it can and helps you organize your experience playing GW2; what's in your bank, on your various characters, various statistics, what's in your material storage (and how much it's worth) which is useful information to know for later. 
---
* Discord - Pretty much any self-respecting guild is going to use discord because it's essentially a community-wide BBS/Messageboard; where you can congregate with guild members outside the game, talk about other games, organize events, post silly memes, cat/doggo pictures.  Even if you never use the VoIP features -- which you should *-shrug-* it's still useful. 
---
* GW2Hook - This is more for a single-player experience; almost everyone's PC is going to bottleneck down to like 30-40 FPS or less at major meta-events; so I don't really see the point making the game look prettier; taste is subjective.  There are plenty of settings to mess around with to alter the game's graphics or various presets to download and experiment with.  
---
* GWTac0 - Overlay with various plugin packs that people develop &amp; contribute to (eg; Tekkit's Workshop packs for LS3-4).  In-game timers for things like world bosses, various achievement and jumping puzzle indicators.

ArenaNet isn't fond of mods; they try to keep things relatively minimalistic which is why are mostly 3rd party or overlays.  Very few programs are allowed to inject data into the game or read memory; ArcDPS being a notable exception.  These are the main one's; use them as much or as little as you want, but they're things for you to play around with, and there really isn't much focus when there is or isn't a good time to start using things.
---
That build was so much fun, especially because of how ridiculous the bleeding damage was.
---
Good thing it was limited to Open World gameplay only considering the broken dps.
---
Any condition based dps build that isn't Condi firebrand. 
---
Renegade, axe mirage, burnserker, scourge, soulbeast are all non burst builds. 
---
Weaver, C. holo, and firebrand Condi builds are exceptions in that while they are DoT based, because of how they function they end up bursting their condis.

/woooosh

"Full" is relative these days...

I have soldier and Valkyrie. Should I stick with that (the squishiness of zerk was odd to me)?
---
&gt;Guardian: Too many buffs and too physical
---
If you want protection and heals this is your guy. It has 3 ranged weapons but only 1 provides healing (staff) - Along with Mace which is unused to my knowledge.
---
Elementalist sounds like your best bet, it can heal through sharing auras with tempest specialization. 
---
Mesmer is basically just a buffer and generally runs swords on both weapon sets.
---

---
This game is pretty alt friendly so don't worry too much about it - You can get [Tomes of Knowledge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tome_of_Knowledge) on your main and use them on alternate characters to level them to max without having to even play them lol.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll definitely do that.

I feel like the idea of "roaming" has changed from searching to 1v1's to getting ganked by 3-5 man death squads.
---
And guilds usually log after an hour so its a laggy mess with plenty of fights and then back to small 10 man groups running around with nothing to do but karma train till next reset.
---
&gt;Save
---
absolutely not. Scrapper wouldn't benefit from half the stats, if you are too squishy you need toughness into your build, maybe vitality. Soldiers would be good (and would make you basically an invincible tank) Paladin's, if you are running condi go for Dire and start swapping zerk/viper stats as you can.
---
I learned when healing scourge was a big thing, and i can do mechanics better than DPS.

-Greens on VG.

-Walls on Gorseval

-Cannons on Sabetha.

-Mushrooms on Sloth

ETC. ETC.
---
It all comes down on how much you want to learn. ATM i am learning Mirage rotation, it's kicking my butt though. 6 hours and i am only half way.
---
Elementalist isn't chaotic.  It's just a challenge.  Challenges aren't bad; they're something to be overcome.  The entirety of the "core" experience in GW2 is like a kiddy pool; it's like 2-3 feet deep pool where you learn to "swim" and tread water.  I'd say go with Elementalist -- you're overestimating the complexity of the game; and if anything is ever too hard you can just camp fire on staff and run around throwing down lava fonts and auto-attacking.
---
For me it's Bloodstone Fen , they shoot you from 2km away .
---
I hope it does work for you but I could possibly see an exploit here, imagine asking support to get your character back in fews months/years. I suppose it would comes back with everything it has previously ? That would still be a free Eternity.
---
&gt;GW2 Tac0 (Helpful Overlay).

Is also to be taken with a grain of salt; It changes the game experience quite dramatically.

If you want to explore and like the feeling of surprise and discovery, don't use it. 
---
If you just want to be efficient and don't mind following markers, if only the result matters to you, go ahead, it's extremely powerful.
---
This exact problem happened to me, support juggled me for over a week and 3 GMs just to say they lack the ability to do anything about this problem

Oh nice idea, didn't think about that

Naw the only moron here is you.  Only a fucking dipshit like yourself take some odd comment that's not really relevant to the main subject of a comment to be offended over and try to get into a pissing match about.  Whether I can buy the pack or not isn't really relevant to whether it should show up in the gem store itself which is the problem I am having.

You should just buy yourself a dictionary and look up the word preparation.

I assume we're about to witness a one-shot fest full of invulns and blocks and blinds.

I'm very concerned with more views on a video that will earn me a whole $4. Imagine what I could do with 3,000 extra views and the extra dollar that would get me! Wow!

I'm so obsessed with clicks that I neglected to post it to reddit myself, what an idiot I am!
---
Or the sharks will knock you off.
---
Most people here give you veterans answers. Like them, I would warn you that most of the pre lv80 Food is cheaper to buy from the trading post. HOWEVER crafting gives you experience, and is part of the leveling: You wander across maps, do you business, harvest chief ingredients, which give you xp, then you use them to craft your own Food and the crafting process gives you xp also. Then you use your Food for your leveling experience, etc.
---
Chief is the most complex, and the other follow patterns you can easily recognize.
---
Wow, its word for word.

'Customer Support does not have the ability to unbind items or remove the item in a way that would not grant you the skins for this weapon.' I'm pretty sure this is false as others have stated in the comments as we can place the bugged weapons on a useless toon and delete it and not unlock the skin, and later have support gift a new version of the weapons.
---
We won't help you... :(
---
There are a lot of solo players who weave in and out of working with other players and squads on our server but who don't want to have to feel locked into anything. Most of us know what to do and will do it better than a group or squad leader can dictate and they kinda know to let the regulars do their thing. They also don't care if we drop group soon after if we take an invite for a fight. Server culture thing I guess.
---
"Its honestly kind of sleazy and very telling that its the only cosmetic you literally cannot earn in game."

Stopped reading right there. Oh yeah Anet are just sleazebags of terrible morale character for having 1 aspect of their game to not have a free option.

yeah at this point I would pay for a monthly sub too if it meant getting more content more often.

You can check wooden potatoes videos on youtube about reshade and hook to get the idea what you can do to customize visuals.
---
He can always ask the support to recovery the character in the future and that makes the weapon comes back, so this wouldn't work.

Thought that was a girl

He didn't. He is responding to the downvotes he's getting. Responding would be taking effort to answer the question.

don't we all think this on some level, but yeah I am tempering my expectations

I feel like it is I would like any thing and everyone is like I want a thing and you know .... build templates

I'm sorry I think they will people are wondering will season 5 be free just listen to the 6th anniversary Z says "we look forward to continuing to give you free episodic content". And before you go he meant for season 4 again he said this after announcing season 4 to season 5. Could they have changed their minds yes of course but  huge selling point of living world is its free episodic content for the 2-3 months its out.
---
can i get any older/
---
 thx for another grey hair
---
What is your point aside just bitching about the 1 (one) and only way this game has to support itself and not offering a single solution of your own?
---
Posts like yours are counter-productive, entitled, and missing the point.
---
Your feeling is shared by a lot of friends of mine. Getting into it is hard. I mostly tried guiding them myself because of this
---
Got it.  Thank you.

Honestly I feel like it was doomed from the getgo, years and years ago. Competitive PvP in MMOs shouldn't *only* be conquest. 1v1 is probably the default preference for a fairly large portion of players and to not have an officially supported and competitive platform for it is atrocious imo. See blade &amp; soul for example... there is arena pvp with 1v1 and 3v3 game modes, and then there's a conquest type of pvp called 6v6 which is basically the same sort of thing as gw2, just the 6v6 on bns wasn't equalised gear.
---
The most popular pvp on bns was always arena with 1v1, BY FAR.
---
Another two MMOs I did a lot of pvp on were runescape and archeage, both with way more of a variety.
---
All games had its flaws but at least the other games I mentioned have variety other than just conquest.
---
There is a Human Face that has like Make-up all over it, might look even better. Other then that, nice meme

Bruh. He put one extra "o" and you literally lost your shit. His priorities are fine, you need to take several seats.

Base is not a skin. It's base.

Don't zerg

If you don't want to install [d912pxy](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy), turn down some graphical options like:
---
* Antialiasing -&gt; Off or FXAA (in my case FXAA consumes less than SMAA)
---
* Reflections -&gt; Disabled (water will look like s\*\*\*, but helps to improve fps's)
---
* Shadows -&gt; At least Low or disabled if you can play that "ugly".
---
* Postprocessing -&gt; Disabled, game will be less brighter, but helps a bit with FPS's too.
---
And the two most Importants:
---
* Character Model Limit/Quality -&gt; Both to Low, and on WvW set Limit to Lowest, you don't need to see every-single-person around you, and will improve by A LOT your framerate.
---
The checkbox options on the bottom on my case won't change a lot, you can try turning off also Ambient Occlusion, your choice.
---
Thanks for your point. It's good to separate this things, that's what I think that's must be done in larger teams. But I'm sure they've to do some break point to know where are they between dev (coders) teams and other team like 3d modelers, soundists. Etc. 
---
That's the harder part I think. And I'm not sure if they're following a convention like scrum or agile. In what I think, I'm sure they've some points of flexion to innovate harder between departments (Dev (Code), 3d modelers, animations, soundists, etc).
---
That's why my curiosity it's more stronger :P
---
I heard the balance team uses smoke signals to communicate within other teams.
---
Holy crap! I've been playing since launch and never heard of or seen this. That's such a cool Easter egg!
---
Dont cry and block?
---
Love your art!
---
I bought mine a while back and I think in general it is worth it.  Especially if you do a lot of farming to get unid green gear.
---
Abd yet there is no part of Charr anatomy left unexposed by at least one armor set. And Charr just need fur.

Nerf FBs.
---
&gt;What's to stop more people from doing this to get the skins and still sell the legendary?
---
Absolutely nothing. I know people who have done this multiple times. It may no longer be the case, but it used to be that if you craft a legendary, equip it, and submit a ticket immediately saying you did it on accident, they would just ask you to delete the item and then mail you a new one.
---
That sure is not my experience on EU. Afternoon/evenings the population is good. There’s often a queue.
---
It doesn't have anything at all to do with your graphics card. Its all the calculations and draw calls your cpu is going through. You also sites an old single player game.  When your cpu has to calculate and send seat calls for what could be a 80 people all fighting its a lot for it to be able to process. Its just a limitation ALL of us have in wvw. They don't make the hardware to make it any better.
---
That's probably the very first thicc asura I've ever seen.
---
Wearing an outfit, not exactly legendary imo, other than the axe ofcourse.
---
you havent read the post to the end, have you?
---
This full on sucks.  Sure the OP is in the "wrong", but anyone looking at this reasonably would conclude no ill intent, and just put in a fix.
---
If this was worth 400g I'd say "sorry OP, life sucks sometimes", but when we are talking about 4000g, OP should fight this until their last breath.
---
Thats because its a Vaanss asura. :D thank you!

I don't know how to install D9 is the issue, But yeah, If I knew how I probably would

Well your mistake to remove sigil RIP bro now just farm again and enjoy your eternity Bye.
---
Got it.
---
By the looks of the avatars, these are the same GMs I had to deal with when trying to undo my accidental overwrite of two rather expensive infusions.  I hope you can get someone who's actually reasonable.
---
Vaanss does often wear outfits. This one is well known to show some special assets, thatswhy I did draw this outfit ;)
---
Yup if your ping isn't 30 or below it's too high :P
---
I don't think it has anything to do with macros, OP is just using the Shift key as a modifier to cast certain skills.
---
For example S+Q means that the skill is bound to Shift + Q.
---
Similarly A+Q would be Alt+Q and C+Q would be Ctrl+Q
---
I like how the claws are retracted on the wounded Charr...

Yea, lol, your post sounded like you play on FA.  And I assume during EU or early NA time period.  There's an FA server discord you should join to get notifications from when a pugmander is tagging up.  [http://discord.fort-aspenwood.com](http://discord.fort-aspenwood.com) from your web browser.

---
Out of all the things I would put money into this game for, seeing more story content is not one of them.
---
Playing a wood plank of a commander vs generic 'evil' dragons has been the crutch of the story since launch. Everytime an interesting villian or outside force gets introduced it is quickly swept under the rug (Joko, Lazarus, etc.). If you want to pay for story I could recommend you many other games that would be much more worth the time and cost.
---
I think the issue here, is that with the new system, it's entirely too easy to do something like this and it should come with confirmation messages for this exact reason, like it does in other areas. It's shoddy implementation and probably an oversight.
---
About the weapon part. I'm a theorycrafter, have always been. I would like to get into some details to understand why axe is better than sword for condition playstyle etc. I could read every single tooltip, list it and compare to condi/power stats to figure out which is better for what and why. But I can't believe Noone did that.
---
\[Malnourished\] or Guild Wars 1's "You have been playing for X hours. Please take a break"  definitely would help there.
---
I hope this charr can still sit at it.
---
Do people like you who tend to shitpost often like this take some sort of medicine to maybe help agaisnt what you’re going through in your head?
---
*Not enough profession-specific energy*. D:
---
They are using blobs to store all account data, not relational tables.
---
Adjusting one value is way more than couple of minutes.
---
You also get 20g every 6 tiers, plus ascended shards of glory for ascended trinkets and armor, kind of like dragonfall with mistborn motes. I'm not claiming it's as good as any pve farm, but it's certainly better than wvw and it has the only truly fully unique prestige reward in the whole game besides titles.
---
100% boon uptime I find more benefitial to raid training, hence why raids were so accessible during chaos chrono era. Aegis/stab/resistance &gt; barrier/transfusion.
---
Both is fine, in the end you will always have a handful of slackers anyway, raid training or not. Just make sure your supporters are not, and everything will work out.
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama or violating the CoC is not allowed.

Hmm, I'd never thought of that. I personally think it's unlikely though, when build templates come out I think they're going to be functionally the same as arcdps, just maybe less buggy and obviously developer-made. I could be wrong though.
---
The camera's helped out nicely, like adjusting the Horizontal Position.
---
It is one thing to make sure they're lined up, but getting the right emote timing is another. Luckily this was in an instance and interrupting actual Salma District RPer's. :3
---
So you’re comparing a solo game to a game mode of another game while zerging that includes idk how many other players, which will logically eat your fps? 
---
Is this your first time playing a game that has more people around or you really cant think a bit?
---
Example of what? 
---
Tbh the balance is pretty good. Sure not every class can fill any role including being to most suitable for 1v1. Of course meta shake ups through balance changes are important but new gamemodes can just as easily shake up a meta and have an alot longer play value.
---
The same women use to let guys she likes him.
---
Other than a mentor tag, I don't know of any tables with apples. Well, there is the Lion's Arch cart of FRESH GENDARRAN APPLES.
---
I definitely recommend Marauder if you feel too squishy; and if you want to focus on condition damage Trailblazer/Carrion mix is usually pretty effective. For warrior I would focus on power builds though, just due to sheer power of Spellbreaker traitline that definitely focuses on physical damage. If you decide that you use Marauder then I pretty much recommend [sigil of Severance](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Severance) as addition to your "Drop from Above" fantasy. It will fix your problems with getting high crit chance and damage from losing offensive stats in favor of vitality.
---
In gw1, you'd have different tabs for different armor/weapon sets.  They'd all be equipped, you'd just switch between them by changing tabs.  I think people are thinking build templates would be similar to that.
---
At this point, the ticket seems to be handled correctly. Deleting items unlock their skins - so that's NOT something that should be done in this case. When we ask a user to throw something away for a replacement, it's stuff that won't give you a skin unlock. 
---
Aside from that, I can only direct to the ticket, this isn't something to solve on reddit.

Usually when people talk about scourge and carries they talk about [this healing build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/heal/).

 It has fairly low damage, nice CC. Its goal is to protect against mechanics with barrier and to help when someone died, since they can fast-res, and port downed players to themselves and away from danger.

For a guide in video form I'd suggest [mighty teapots guide](https://youtu.be/mPFU28vh5vY), it might be nearly a year old, but as far as I know not much has changed.

He wouldn’t be guaranteed/forced the craft Eternity like he would initially want to. If they give him both swords he can just as easily sell both separately for more gold than if he crafted Eternity and sold it.
---
I wish pve gold farm *did* require a brain. It's a point in pvp's favor that you have to actually play the game to get rewards.
---
Again, pvp is way better than wvw at least, and all those factors you mentioned about effort and toxicity mean that even if pvp had better rewards it wouldn't draw lots of new players in because the pve casuals don't want to deal with toxic teammates or have to learn how to read animations and rotate and use their skills properly for the situation. It's too much effort regardless.
---
I understand people wishing things weren't as they said they are, but comments such as "the CS team is lazy" or "they are lying" are not helpful - and in fact untrue.
---
Deleted characters can be restored, as such, deleting the character with items on it doers not remove the item from the game.
---
Does deleting a character with a locked skin on them unlock the skin? I know a worry there is that they could just recover that character through support at some later time, but is there a way to put a mark on that character at all? I have absolutely no idea of your systems just trying to throw ideas out there.
---
Condi Weaver
---
I remember that someone was having a problem with support and people recommended to ask to speak to the Lead GM or a supervisor or something and that got things rolling in the right direction.
---
What is about Vaanss? :o
---
I did the testing before I posted actually but I wrote the "how to" in case you or anyone else wanted to double check. 
---
Marching golems do not cast skills unfortunately.
---
&gt;But I can't believe Noone did that.
---
You're right. People already did that. And they came up with the builds you see around. They could release all the material they have amassed in the years of studying the game, but it would be pages upon pages of information that will eventually lead you to the builds they already released.
---
The only place I can think of that you could theorycraft and maybe come up with something new is PvP and WvW. Fractals and Raids are static content that doesn't undergo changes with patches and have been around for quite a while. Professions may be rebalanced and that's the only time you may be able to theorycraft something for those two contents, but it will take you months of studying Fractals and the Raid encounters plus studying every weapon, every profession and their respective traits for you to even start theorycrafting something that Snowcrows and Discretize don't already know.
---
As /u/chabatangnu said, each weapon has a different impact in each profession. An Axe won't be the same in the hands of a Ranger and in the hands of a Revenant. You also have to account all the possible traitlines available and all the traits contained in them.
---
In the end, what you seem to be looking for is a compilation of all weapons on all professions, all traits, all elite specializations, all runes and all sigils available in the game. You can find all that information in different links in the Wikia
---
[Example 1](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rune)

[Example 2](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil)

---
&gt; Energy management is something you have to learn as revenant. I hate the class personally but it's certainly not "Stand around waiting for energy."
---
I found that problem seems to have gone away now that I am using Shiro/Kalla
---
Can I ask for source on this "building on old maps  instead of expanding to new ones"?
---
Sure, but you'd have to go through with a customer service action to restore said deleted character, it's not like a customer can do that unilaterally. Do you not have any kind of flag you can place on an account to provide information in case of further tickets that would avoid that kind of issue?
---
Sorry, didn't mean to act like I knew better. A lot of us see situations like this and because we don't understand how the backend works we make assumptions. Most of us don't mean bad, we just clueless as to what does and doesn't work. In any case though, the OP did make a mistake due to an oversight in the game and it doesn't seem fair that he is punished for that.
---
Macaulay Macaulay Culkin Culkin
---
How is it logic? Why the heck should one have to know they can't sell un-sigiled legendaries from looking at other legendaries? It's just bad design and the 101 of design is to "Always have confirmation screen for important shit" and this seems pretty important.
---
Play where you want however you want. GW2 has the amazing luxury of the level 1-80 level experience just being you having fun however. Most of the game is spent played at 80.

congratulations on eternity! im sure it would look amazing on your character
---
You're fine, you're fine. :3
---
Just wanted to stress that when we say NO, we don't do it for a lark.
---
We do not have a flag to prevent character undeletion.
---
We have no means of doing so, as stated previously. Believe me, we'd have a process for that, if it were an option.
---
Phew, will keep that in mind.
---
On another note, do you guys take note of system limitations for support and pass those on to get looked at eventually to see if they can be changed to make things easier for both the user and support?
---
but why are they using my cpu for that
---
But GMs and such check ticket history, I thought thus, if this person ever goes back and wants the character restored, the GMs can say no and have a verifiable reason for it.
---
It is possible to get through a lot with just button mashing. If you don't do any content where paying attention is required or don't care to play(that would be my case) at that sort of level then nothing is going to change.
---
I feel personally attacked by this.
---
Learn to read the map. Action is where the white swords are at. If something got recently flipped and is off cooldown soon, head over there. 
---
Don't know about your server, but mine often won't respond to "lfg plz" or "any action?" chat messages, since they often come from newer people and/or those looking to get commanded/carried. Learn to be efficient and valuable to the server on your own.
---
why does this post have so many downvotes
---
Yeah but I often heard like "we send it to you but you have to delete the other thing" I don't think that's so different
---
This is pathetic, Anet adds confirmation windows for even destroying garbage and yet they forget to add one about how removing a sigil will bind the weapon to you? Lazy oversight from people that don't play their own game.
---
Unless it lets you bypass the movement speed cap it is actually 33% vs 36% when out of combat which would be much harder to notice.
---
Malcicious Sorcery and Dual Wielding are still speed increases but only Malicious Sorcery is useful ... if you are running around gathering stuff.
---
I meant more along the lines of a notice flag to inform future CS reps not to un-delete a character. Obviously a character undeletion flag would be needlessly specific, but you could accomplish the same effect with a tag saying something to the effect of "This account had -action- occur in -ticket record x- and deleted -character y-. Do not undelete this character. -dornsinger
---
Or something like that.
---
Why not try selling it directly to someone? There are plenty of Discord servers and groups out there to list it, and most of the time you end up making more profit as you bypass listing fee and TP tax.
---
What is your player model limit set at? Im trying to decide if it is worth upgrading my 7700k to ryzen. I get 60+ frames at 1440p but only with player model limit on low or lowest.
---
Sometimes I feel that actually Anet as a company developed huge level of hypocrisy due to rather successful and innovative game on launch. Problem is that industry moved forward 7 years implementing successful mechanics of GW2 in new projects and making better games, while Anet stayed in glorified past and do not like anything "new".
---
Make one? You could even just make a black-list for CS to refer before restoring a character.
---
Unfortunately, deleting an item (at least for Legendary weapons) does unlock the skin. :(
---
I’d say there’s probably a 90% chance LW5ep1 will release either that weekend or the Tuesday after that Friday.
---
nice try Anet.
---
I can understand why they wouldn't want to do a "legendary" mount skin reward. I know for myself and many others, having the legendary glider reward as an option put me off from ever wanting to buy a glider skin, largely because the legendary one has more prestige and looked cool enough.
---
But there's no reason to not have some fairly basic mount alternatives that you can win through doing stuff in game. People would still find the 2000 gem ones more attractive, but it gives players the incentive to collect more stuff and have alternative looks. Just looking at how much effort people put into getting a new mount type that they may never use (e.g. Warclaw for people who don't even WvW), I can see people doing the same just for a fairly basic looking skin.
---
Good luck catching the ball with those claws.
---
I only group when I’m not on my ranger since in my experience people don’t always react that well to seeing a ranger or thief  in WvW.
---
I have a firebrand and scourge but I don’t find them as fun so I play my ranger a lot more.
---
I used mesmer as example. I didn't decided what to main yet :)
---
Thanks for the tips, I'll make some excel from sources I have to determine what links with what the most optimally. For classes I'm interested in (ele, mesmer, engi)
---
The question is...
---
If scourge lets you ignore mechanics, why not run it all the time?
---
There are good books (as harry potter or lotr) but also many "not so great" stories. Even some of the most popular (batman etc.) are very...limited I'd say... I think final fantasy is ~ average when it comes to such a comparision. FF is ofc by far not on the level of merlin, harry potter, or Lotr. In the end it's a JRPG and maybe also more comparable to anime than to western fantasy with it's different world/character designs.
---
Priority for many videogames is gameplay, not storytelling. So your descriptions of "gameplay sections" "cutscene sections" is correct.  Players would struggle to keep track of story in fights. It's difficult to do two things at the same time, especially in action-oriented combat as in GW2 which requires full attention.
---
But as comparision see this nearly 20 year old game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-KlucDRo4
---
Starts with a calm dialoge between characters (helps to "form" their personalities, tells about background/motives), directly moves to action cutscenes ("current events/main story"), integrates a combat scene in - with an integrated gameplay explanation for ranged combat - and returns to action-cutscene and story. In GW2 these parts are not as fluent. It's important to keep/build up tension. Same as background/"personality" dialogues occur rarely and often only a single time. A good example is this ridiculus norn funeral in main game personal story. Character is dead, you hold a speech at a funeral, cut. Is never really brought up again. Is not forming your character (or those of your teammates), is having no impact. There is a difference between writing some bullet points ("character X dies") and good story telling which includes descriptions of emotions, grief, anger etc. When gandalf "dies" in lotr movie they are sad. Not just for a short scene after they got out of the mines. They didn't happily walk to the elves and hold a big happy celebration there. The movie takes its time to express emotions, anything else would appear unrealistic and would be bad story telling. GW2 is very bad at fleshing out such events and give them the required time, depth or realistic changes in personality. This isn't even a story only problem, it goes for everything in GW2. Guildhalls could also be more constanly upgraded, be more well thought out, be better integrated into the game. GW2 is a lot of "fire and forget" in all aspects.
---
That's nice mechanic. I'll check it for sure, thank you! I'm not used to use wiki so I mostly ignored it when it appeared in forums. I'll dive into it.
---
What's peoples issue with Vaans?
---
furries :/
---
Well 3v3 would be way more balanced and competitive, 2v2 would really only be able to be for fun as its super unbalanced and ANet doesnt care about pvp balance anymore
---
Probably because ANet has alienated all of the core WvW players and guilds.
---
RUN BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE! ESCAPE WHILE YOU CAN!
---
But support could easily flag his account with a do not restore
---
Best advice I can give you is to throw your expectations and ideas of how things should be out the window. It sounds like things are not playing out how you envision they should and thats a source of why the game isnt clicking for you. So after you have thrown your preconceptions out the window (keep doing it when ever they come back) take some time re-read the skill/trait tooltips, think about trait combos and stats in ways you might have previously discounted and look at some other popular builds, guides and test things out (like really test shit out and try to improve). Its also totally okay for the game to not work for you, not every person in the world has to like something as much as someone else does.
---
It started lagging since they switched to Amazon servers.
---
I would party up but I always end up with freaks who can't even say hello, socially retarded people who can't interact one with a other at a slightly deeper level than "I need you to help me get that objective".
---
Commanders who keep squads closed.
---
Commanders who insist on TS to be able to joke on limited comms instead of using Discord.
---
Anet who only did one thing to make WvW more social.
---
Fuck this, man. Fuck all of it.
---
WVW has been very slow and I don't understand why, before I could enjoy the game a lot, now the game freezes and takes a long time to respond again. I play PvE and everything goes well, I go to WvW and the game goes very slow. What it could be? This is annoying me now honestly, I literally miss the action because my game freezes during the fights and when the game responds, the action is over.
---
This happens to me since July 8.
---
OwO

« I know that there are fields and whatnot in GW2, but you really don't use them as people like to act like you do «

They are very important in PvP, especially for Weaver, Engineer or Thief.

MSN Messenger
---
Umm... emphasis? It looks like 100% skins and outfits to me. :O
---
That may not record item deletion, as deleted characters can be recovered for a while after being deleted.
---
Charrs swim naked 😁
---
Anet support is an absolute joke, much like the game itself. Enjoy your gem store.
---
While it's a nice QoL feature in theory, if one's Eternity (or another locked skin) is deleted by a malicious sibling, or one's account is otherwise compromised, Customer Support could just recover it. Removing the "deleting equipment unlocks the skin in the wardrobe" feature might not be a bad idea, since it's an extremely underused/unheard-of/not-so-useful QoL feature to begin with.

Good to know mesmers state isn't too good. I used mesmer as an example, not decided yet. I like ele but it seems to be the most complicated class in the game, which kinda scares me out of ele...

Where is the female human?

piss of, kevin.
---
Stick with minecraft, it's better.
---
This is a good list.

However none will increase the FUN.  You have to bring that yourself.

---
Server-side engine issue (keeping in mind much of this must be single threaded...).
---
&gt; have the servers power/size changed?
---
Could be part of it, but we'll never know unless ANet engineering comes out and states it.
---
Half of the posts here are about charrs lol
---
Inner introvert says no, but it may happen that I actually have some friends in the game. My guild from wow moved here like 4 years ago. Perhaps they're still here :)
---
I enjoy gw2pao (just google that)
---
It's a clean overlay for showing event timers, market watch and some other features I haven't used.
---
Still hhave a bunch of mine.
---
Had a number of people ask how the F my guardian was summoning all kinds of stuff.
---
Is that it, or are they yet to announce what'll be on sale during the second half of August?
---
Thanks man. I already mentioned in one comments, I was ignoring wiki because there is always a better resources site in every game I used to play. I guess gw2 is different so I'll catch up :)  thanks!
---
Well if they plan on expanding on previous maps, it has to either be Core Tyria, or PoF maps (if LS5 is linked to PoF). Too bad they can't do LS maps, I'd love to see them expand on these too.
---
Yes.... That was intentional.. *cough *
---
It's funny because your comment was attempting to mock OP but in a way you actually agree with him that the sales are mostly trash.
---
Nah, they've still got some decency, and their Blood Legion swimwear... :D
---
Most NA servers have close to full maps during prime time, and a lot of communication happens on voice comms or server chat on Discord. Try to find your server's community Discord or Teamspeak
---
Guess they're leaving better stuff for the end.
---
Shine Guardian is already there, No sale though - Full price.
---
A cheater who got banned 3 months and is always saying that he is the best. And has some weird kink with butts and boobs

No

Memory is a bit foggy, but I'm pretty sure that's what they did last year.
---
Heh. Don't worry, he's fine! The one who threw the ball might have a problem though...
---
how long did it take you?
---
No.
---
That's probably even less suspicious if anything, lots of people bought basic accounts when they was on sale for the login bonus - Many of them probably still use them today.
---
Vaans, he is from Spain. He is from the CAKE guild, upload pvp and wvw videos on his YouTube channel. He is just a little arrogant.
---
All his characters are female, so he pretends to be female just for attention. lmao.
---
Outfits are hated by many, but more are buying them I guess since they continue with this bullshit
---
Exactly. As long as nobody is harmed... who cares? Let people be happy

When I buy with PayPal it will redirect to a browser window. Something on your system might be breaking that part of it. No idea bout the credit issue.

Blood Legion. I wouldn't recommend saying that out loud to them, especially after this incident...
---
Sounds like someone didn't want to do their job.
---
While I do get your point, there's lot of quality of life things ANet sells for gems that could be on sale and that are not pay-to-win.
---
* Extra character slots
---
* Extra inventory slots
---
* Increased material storage
---
* Extra bank tabs
---
* Infinite gathering tools
---
* Infinite Trading Post express
---
* Infinite bank access
---
* Infinite Teleport to Friend
---
&gt; Notice the emphasis on....
---
Notice what? that they have only announced sales for the first half of the month. Also notice with a quick look at previous years those utility items you are looking for show up later in the month.
---
If its "An error has occurred. Please try later", throw support a ticket. When i had it (each time, thrice now) it turns out my account got flagged as suspicious bc i never buy gems and "suddenly" im making a purchase (£10-20). Support fixed it within a few days.
---
If it's sth else, I'd still try a ticket if I were you. Might be a similar issue and they can usually help o.o
---
BLOOD LEGION? And NO females?

Even better, get his account. I have my brother account too and mail items to my main from time to time

You missed the comma.  As they say, the difference between "Let's eat grandma" and "Let's eat, grandma".
---
The game is F2P, and if you did purchase the expansions, there still remains no monthly fee.
---
I started playing shortly after PoF and have logged over 3K hours. I'd say I've gotten more than my money's worth, given I've spent the same $$$ for games I played for only a fraction of that time.
---
&gt;so then does that not point to the fact that heal scourge in and of itself hurts training.
---
*Sigh*. You're literally just arguing for the sake of arguing now.
---
I said that while it's true that they can cheese through mechanics, responsibility also falls on the trainer to explain said mechanics that were cheesed through.
---
And herein lies my other point that you failed to understand. A good trainer will explain anything that goes on in a fight, regardless of what class they're playing, be it carry scourge or whatever. A bad one would just do like you described, blasting through shit without even talking about it.
---
And this ties into another comment here that you should've read;
---
&gt; If people want to learn, they will learn. No matter who's healing.
---
Play whatever healer you want, at the end of the day it all depends on your trainees' capacities to learn. 
---
&gt; arguing that it helps in any way is just admitting the group cant do mechanics. but sure. moot point because the role doesnt help training at all and hurts a ton.
---
The *fuck*? It's a **training** group you dunce. Why would you expect people to even **know how* to do mechanics in the first place? 
---
People learn differently. No sense in trying to argue about what healer to use when what you *should* be asking is if the trainer knows what they're doing, if they're patient, etc etc. Deciding what class to play should be the last thing on anybody's mind.
---
Jesus.
---
I am disappointed they are in packages.  I only see one that is under 800 gems.
---
First of all that was my thought too. But who does not like a well defined sexy ass xD
---
On the one hand, joy of Charr art.  }]:3
---
On the other hand, sadness of another year without ANet giving us a swimsuit. ;_;
---
" but whenever these ideas get thrown, we have indeed already thought about them in the past. "

like yall thought about the empty string hash and did not wrongfully ban accounts due to your hidden spyware?
---
Not in this warband, but that wasn't a deliberate choice. Their centurion is female, and she would probably say that she's got more important things to do than lazing on the beach. :D
---
&gt; The adult thing to do is just explain why something is taking so long or why it can't come out
---
I agree.
---
&gt; Blaming sensational idiots for piss-poor communication standards is ridiculous
---
Sensational idiots are a problem in every fandom, some are worse than others and while it may not be the defining factor for anets less than great communication it still is contributor.  Look at the OP, specifically the words have the lines thru them "...fulfill that promise or at least..." "...we were told..." That is a prime example of someone taking what a dev is saying as literal fact and a promise while at the same time ignoring all the context surrounding the conversation taking place. Anet shutting down communication is bad but so are the people that latch onto everything devs say about potential future things as promises.
---
I think if you remove rewards from 3 there would be riots, though I 100% agree with you that 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 in an ideal world. However, the fact that you get pips even for losing in pvp means that there are still rewards for 3, you'll just lose a lot. Imo losing should give 0 pips and winning should give a few more pips, raid rewards should get cranked up and dragonfall/silverwastes should get hammered, and wvw should focus the rewards on actually winning your matchups, but unfortunately ANet has made it pretty clear that none of those things will ever happen.
---
This is the only version, sorry. :P
---
Come on, move your body
---
NA also has the same server issues, though it's not as bad probably due to the fact that we have less people playing in general. Ive noticed that most fights on ebg have some degree of skill lag, and smc fights are super annoying to play
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...

---
Total number of non-gem rewards vs gem store? (Really only interested in %, ex 70% of skins are attainable without gem store)
---
I clearly didn't say Lw 5 would be charged for. It will be free. But the elite specs won't be. That would still fit his statement of the "episodic content" being free.
---
&gt; So what can you recommend to me for a **trial** version? I tend to play Mesmer over Necromancer over Elementalist over Guardian. **Without DLCs**. What are you thoughts?
---
Elementalist and Mesmer would be fine choices, but I'd like to make a plug for Guardian just so you don't dismiss it too readily.
---
The protection skills \*are\* awesome, as you mentioned. Nothing makes me feel more badass than using Shield 5 to make a huge dome to protect my allies from incoming arrows and spells, or throwing up a magic wall to reflect arrows back at the enemy.
---
And as for being 'too physical', I just want to point out that Guardians can use Staff, Scepter, Focus, and Torch, none of which are melee weapons. You can definitely play a Guardian as a caster without touching melee, all magic all the time I wish I could describe how they feel better but unfortunately I don't use them often, as I quite like the melee weapons. But that's because even the melee weapons are somewhat mixed. One of the three sword skills is actually a projectile magic attack that simultaneous blocks incoming projectiles, and another one is a shadowstep that throws down a damaging AoE symbol and blinds the enemy, just for a couple of examples. So even when you're using melee weapons you're often creating a bit of space, casting magic spells with your sword or axe or whatever, then closing in to melee for a bit.
---
Plus, if you ever get Path of Fire and pick up the Firebrand specialization, the tome skills will be a large part of your gameplay and those are entirely magic skills, nothing physical. However, many of them are short range magic skills, encouraging you to stay near melee distance.
---
So I'm not trying to change your mind or anything, just trying to give you a description of how Guardian "feels" to play. It's not a melee class and it's not a magic class, it's more of a short to mid-distance in-your-face caster with very \*tangible\* magic that occasionally actually hits you in the face with a sword when all other options are exhausted.
---
If you want to start trying from f2p, Necro minion staff/axe/scepter master. It let you get into GW2 universe with ease and less frustration.
---
-
---
If you want to try timing explosion, Mesmer is not bad. BUT Mesmer is powerful in sword fight at least up to lvl60(where my toon is now).
---
Like the other redditers say, it is extremely easy to create new characters with new eMails.
---
I meant "What is the problem with Vaanss, that it is getting downvoted" my bad. Now I do know the answer because of the other comments...
---
That's an excellent way to put it.
---
It’s not suspicious.  Where you could get into trouble is if RMT gets mixed in from his items, so if you trust your brother never used RMT, you should be perfectly fine.
---
Completely unplayable
---
You also have to be careful about feedback from other players.  "Suck", "hard", "too complicated"..but in what context?  In high end group play, yes a core Mesmer (without expansions) would suck.  But for just learning the game, open world / question, it's perfectly fine.  
---
Elementalists are squishy because they have the lowest health pool, and in this game to get max DPS, you have to run full glass cannon. But that again is in high end group content.  For open world leveling and such, you can run more defensive gear that makes them less squishy.
---
Both Mesmer and Elementalist fit your description of "magic and beautiful looking abilities", so why not give them a try and see what fits you.
---
Truth
---
That's fair, but my reason for mentioning the F2P aspect was in reference to the Gem Store in general.
---
Actually they very easily do gem store refunds. I got a certain glider and didn't like it. I asked for a refund , got it within 24 hours, and the  glider skin just stayed unlocked. I'm sure they would not let someone abuse that though.
---
Imagine being stupid enough to pay almost 20 bucks for that crap
---
Yeah they can do them, I’ve had one too. They just do them infrequently and the number of refunds is limited per account
---
I have done this . I only did it once , because I really didn't like the item I got once I was actually using it. I asked for a refund, got it promptly, and they just left the glider unlocked.
---
\^this  
---
every time I give my main the items from the login rewards and my guild bank is full I have to send them via mail and that can be very much. I do this since the login rewards where implemented and had never any problems.
---
&gt;if I don't consider all pros and cons of all professions I'll start with the wrong one and will have to start the game again with another one wasting my time &gt;.&lt;
---
Are you enjoy playing game? If not, why are here. If yes, then you are enjoying.

I believe I have been starting from fresh numerous times, I still find new and un-discover stuffs.

Luckily, I don't care about worthless internet points.
---
I kinda wish ANet would bridge the gap between players but I think there's a fundamental difference between them. One wants to be rewarded for effort and the other group wants everything to be effortless.
---
&gt; I bet there are GM commands or something for both of those actions
---
Yeah, no. Reverting things back to their previous status has the very unfun tendency of BREAK EVERYTHING whose progress pendends on those things' status. In a massive game like gw2, there are probably millions of moving pieces, and no single one person who knows them all. Reverting things is one of the riskier things you can do
---
Reddit dislikes outfits only so far as they want to be able to mix-and-match them. Outfits in general are pretty well-received and are probably one of the biggest sellers behind mount skins. They wouldn't keep pumping them out if they weren't.
---
I hope you’re right. I’d love to invest more time in the game. Now I do daily T4 fracs and log off. Even the raid rewards don’t have me incentivized to learn the new wings. Last wing I completed was dhuum.

I always upvote warframe content, tenno.

It's foolish to think any sensible developer identifies records in the database by their name, not by some unique internal ID/GUID. A deleted character is merely marked as deleted, all the data, including the original name, remains either directly in the database or archived somewhere in case the user would want to restore that character.
---
To unite all peoples within our nation!
---
GW2 has kinda slobbered all over the Norn.  Thematically I like big, solitary lonewolf style hunters, but we just feel like plus sized humans that like to throw parties.
---
I run staff and pistol/pistol. The unload on the pistols is still very high damage, gives you a break from being up close, and is fun to play in PvE
---
Exactly! I don’t mind that every once in a while, but the norn are proud people, and fierce warriors, and solitary. I’d love a more in-depth look at them, but I’m not expecting that’ll happen. :(

That stuff is unplayable, but here's a 3 hour movie if you really care to learn about our new rag-tag group of heroes.
---
They've got matching swimtrunks and they look like the ones the tigers wear in Zootopia, who *have* to be gay.
---
I think.... since they launched the game... I’m not sure tho
---
Can confirm, my server complains about it way more than usual. And it's not just "wah I lost the fight so I must blame something", I'm playing with actual competent people and I'm myself getting skill delays from 3 seconds to infinity. It's rare, but when it happens, most of the squad is affected.
---
No the issue as I noted in the second half is that it is structured like a Korean mmo, not like a sub based one. Introducing a sub wouldn’t magically rebuild the game from the ground up to allow the devs to have greater freedom in how they delivered content. 
---
Perhaps saying no one would sub is hyperbole but very few people would even if it came with the guarantee that content were more frequent and rewards were earnable in game. That’s just not the majority of the gw2 playerbase.
---
I’d also recommend taking a look around comments on the sub or surveys conducted by various sites as a very large number of gw2 players are playing it as their secondary mmo so to say most aren’t playing 2 at once isn’t entirely accurate.
---
20? That means no Cantha, duh.
---
Very much exactly this ^ LOL, p/p and a staff + the zoomy dodge
---
Guildnite
---
the first spec of the three rows for a starter class i would say, and along the time every one will have more than 4 characters anyway, levelup in gw2 is alot easier than others mmorpgs, and can be done casually.
---
I'll have one fried chicken, please!
---
I believe that many of the people making such idiotic claims are very well aware of how stupid they sound.  But they also know that the people who fall in line behind their claim are not deep thinkers, maybe disconnected or looking for something to belong to;  Those who follow will be easy to manipulate.
---
Funny enough reverting stuff is something I do often as a programmer myself (and I work on quite some big projects). If it's coded appropiately, querying the database to revert something manually is safe because usually the triggers for data associated with that data can be flagged out. How would you test things otherwise? --Edit record x --no propagation.
---
But it's not low risk... Rolling back achievements, skins and progression that's never been done could cause SO MANY bugs to appear. I should know that, I am a programmer and DB master. Though not for games, I can clearly say that they probably just don't have the resources to deal with a new DB feature like that.
---
A lack or resources, time and the high risk of messing the database means they are not ready to change this.
---
20th of octodecember, nice
---
I wouldn't think charr would believe in vacations.
---
Elementalist can be hard to master for raids, but you should be fine to level up and play PvE. Or even WvW should be fine. I started on an elementalist amd I don't raid on it but it's still my favorite open world class to play.
---
It should be perfectly fine to start on ele if that's your thing. You can play it Dagger on each hand as a melee mage (not meta build but you can totally do it in PvE), with a staff (which has huge AoE) or other combination of weapons. Tempest (ele elite specialization) Dagger/Dagger is really fun!
---
Reaper (necro elite specialization) is also really fun.
---
You should definitely try both!
---
I never go to Bloodstone Fen except to farm nodes, but I'm sure you've chosen some random boss with infinite projectiles or a one shot mechanic just to prove me wrong. Unless it is literally not soloable, this build can do it, this is basically the optimal dungeon soloing thief build except that experienced players cut invigorating precision for the extra ferocity trait.
---
If this build can't do it in the hands of a good player then no build can (not counting cheese like "constant projectiles so you must take a class with reflects l0l" or "boss is literally immune to power damage and you need condis").
---
If you were trying to be funny you should have put /s .\_.
---
Radiance and Zeal are typically the two traitlines contributing the most to a Guardian's DPS. Virtues is a solid third traitline. Honor is generally a more healing/support-oriented line, so you can ignore it if you're just leveling. 
---
Best weapon is probably Greatsword. Scepter/Focus is a nice secondary option with ranged damage, but experiment with other weapons just so you know what they do. Some folks love the feel of Hammer even if it's not as good for damage. Sword is something I take in PvP to teleport to my target. Mace/Shield and Staff are more for healing or support.

For utility skills, Bane Signet is a nice passive damage buff that can be used for CC in a pinch. I personally love the shouts for ready access to various boons, but you can take a wide variety of skills for different scenarios. Sword of Justice is more damage and vulnerability application. You have access to projectile reflection or Condi cleanse. There's lots to experiment with.

Wat dis OwO?

Its not a problem. Everything of charr make is made of good steel and strong leather
---
Well done detective.

What class would even have bard for an elite? Mesmer?
---
I disagree with this. Elementalist isn't that hard to learn for gamers who are gamers. This is a guy who's more of a I like to play what I like to play the way I like to play it type guy. I'm more like him than a gamer who's going to focus on a rotation or be good at a game.
---
Of all 9 classes, ele and engie are my two hardest classes to play. I'm not saying I can't play them but I die more on those classes than any other and that would likely frustrate the OP.  
---
To a lot of people it doesn't matter if the death penalty is very lenient, since dying for some of us represents a sort of failure. I think it has to do with the type of games you played and where you came from.
---
When I started playing games, we couldn't even save games and dying meant you had to start over. If you play 3d Shooters, you're going to die regularly and just respawn and it's no big deal either way...but I don't play those. 
---
So we might have different ideas both on hard to learn and the ability to survive. Not sure the OP is like me, but I suspect he/she is.
---
Tonight has been beyond unplayable, i've never seen the servers act so badly on a reset in the past 6 years of playing... Something must have gone wrong because even the squad markers were lagging out.

Can you send the item via mail?
---
If so it could be sent to a middleman/gm who already has the skin unlocked and this Player deletes the item for you.
---
&gt; catching the ball**s**

FTFY
---
I know I have these problems buying directly, but PayPal works. I don't use explorer/edge.
---
Looks like Croc brand swimming trunks made it to Tyria
---
Maybe he can still send the item by mail?
---
If so it could be sent to a middleman/gm-char who already has the skin unlocked and this player deletes the item for him.

TS has better sound and better performance than discord. Thats why people use it.

Wine for Mac utilizes the MoltenVK (Metal) translation layer. Haven’t looked to deep into it yet, but may work well. The original Mac client was a Cider (proprietary Wine) wrapper, and I remember seeing that GW2 was fully supported on Wine way back in 2012. My biggest issue is not having the time to try it out, as I just use Boot Camp when playing most of the time.

*Might* be 20 January 2020 for the Jormag expansion /shrug

That wasn't me that was OP but since we're having a definition off :P
---
sleazy - adj -  (of a person or situation) sordid, corrupt, or immoral. 
---
Now, you can call me an old-fashioned Everquestian Luddite, but this whole trend where videogames have the balls to charge $25 (or possibly more if you're a gambling addict who happened to get sucked in by lootboxes) for something that a decade ago would have been an in-game reward, I see that as immoral. Sure, there are much worse things happening in the world. I'm not gonna defend anyone calling Anet fascist, but sleazy? I think that's right on the ball.
---
This is quite interesting, because I would have said that that was exactly how they deliver their worldbuilding. Almost every single dynamic event is exactly that, and there's so much ambient dialogue and NPCs you can talk to. I actually think PoF really dropped the ball in this sense, with having so few dynamic events and so few of those having any worldbuilding in them. Having said that I think the domain of Vabbi was amazing for this - good events and dialogue and there was some amazing examples of tell, don't show. A visit to the boneyard teaches so much about the awakened's status in society.
---
However, you're quite right that a lot of this is not part of the main flow of the game (if you strictly follow the story). For me it makes sense that the worldbuilding happens in... the world, but I can see that the story missions themselves often don't go into this stuff.
---
OMG pull your head out. They literally said they don't want to do a map every episode if it doesn't fit - the comment you are responding to is literally referencing the dude in charge of GW2's development saying they don't plan to do what you say they are going to do.
---
Why bother communicating with people like you at all when you are just going to say ArenaNet will paint the wall blue just after ArenaNet says they plan to paint it orange?
---
You know it must be true if there is math involved.
---
People are just not playing reset because the lag is too terrible for them. It is noticeably worse, and there are conspiracy theories going around of downgraded servers to prepare for lower populations.
---
Still this seems to affect mostly reset time and big fights and it's still fine for the most part at lower player counts which is what NA sees outside of reset and certain server prime times.
---
I take more issue with them not being able to mark "This character was deleted as part of resolving a support ticket, do not restore." as a note for this account.
---
Of maps that can reward a Black Lion Key: yes, Bloodstone Fen is easily the fastest.
---
Bloodstone Fen yes.

I work with databases for a living. Whenever a CS rep says something's impossible, what they mean to say is that _they themselves_ don't have the tools to do it. But impossible? Absolutely not. Somewhere at ANet is an overworked DBA with a superiority complex, who has the ability to fix your problem with a few lines of SQL. The problem is getting this escalated to the point where he gets an email from his supervisor telling him what to do, at which point he'll spend five minutes writing the script and six hours bullshitting about how he's almost got it ready until he executes it half an hour before quitting time.
---
Point is, keep at it, and this will probably get resolved _eventually_.
