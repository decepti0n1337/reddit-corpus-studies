Try actually having a proper sentence structure, and be less condescending next time.
---

---
The point you were attempting to make is now void.
---
Regardless, we’re discussing two points, that don’t counteract with one another.
---
One, is Delta’s statement. He was told the 15th would be nice time to stop it. So he’s doing then.
---
The other, is the reasoning behind why Anet wants it stopped. Which is, if a free version is out there, no one would buy their extra slots.
---
“The other” is the comment you replied to using “one”. Which, is moot.... since Inari was talking about WHY Anet wants it stopped, not what delta said.
---
Try reading comprehension, I heard they teach it young... it’s possible you missed it. Now, go back to the child’s table *the adults are talking*.
---
So tomorrow **don't download** the latest version of arc template as it should be able to work for an other 2 weeks. Let's hope that ANET won't break it before their thing goes out.
---
Man no offense but if i have to believe either SC or you, i chose SC.
---
Also seriously? Are you listíng "no spotter" as a whole different build?
---
Offtank another whole bulld? Hahahahaaaaaa... Cmon...
---
PS: doesnt snowcrows have the meta builds? Why are you playing NON META (Aka worse) builds?
---
Well, the thing with that is that we ask people to do benches, back then people didnt ask for logs and just assumed it was legit (because I wouldnt expect guildmates to lie about this tbh). If a bench was done with writs it would go on the website without us knowing it used writs. SC was never intentionally trying to pawn off benches with writs as legit.
---
Fortunately now everyone just shows food or links a log in their description and its fine (dont hate on me for not showing food in pslb bench please...)
---
1.) The rewards. Having a specific challenge mode reward that can be used to purchase the red infusion is really cool. The additional pristine relics and fractal relics per day make it faster to get to desired goals that would otherwise be timegated more heavily. The secondary aspect is the challenge. The CM fractals feel like the mechanically hardest fracs in the game. They don’t just require team coordination, but individual skill (especially the tiles, combined with splaying rings, the deathballs, and anomoly on Arkk). 
---
2.) Different? making sure fractal instabilities don’t either kill or trivialize the encounter. In general, balancing classes with high-level fractals in mind would be great, as we went from being able to Run druid+chrono, or scourge+chrono or Alacrity Rev w/ quickness firebrand, to just Alacrity Rev and Quickbrand because the balancing team didn’t have 5-person content in mind.
---
3.) Honestly I would love it if the actual graphical effect of the space creatures was released as an infusion (i.e. the harbinger of woe). I really want an infusion that actually looks like that effect (with the destroyed world). Currebtly the red cele infusion just changes your skin. Also Viirastra has special leyline legging that don’t have the skirt, and it’d be awesome for that to drop somewhere.
---
4.) See #1. But especially I love the moments where a single player or 2 can clutch up when the fireteam dies and saves the encounter, or really, when any individual can sort of have breakout moments. The best experiences in 100cm I’ve had were barely eeking out a win on Arkk with 2 people by doing every correctly and thinking quickly.
---
Just don't dwl a new version of template tomorrow: it's not like delta can disable the version you have now.
---
That will be a truly sad day for this game.  My enjoyment of the game will be significantly reduced.
---
Anet is adding their own build templates in about two weeks. People are crying because they're manchild and can't save 20+ builds and will have to decide between about 6 or so stat templates to be able to instant swap between. They'll still be able to swap as much as they please, but god forbid they have to manually click some buttons.
---
I'm at the "grind map materials and pay 5 gold per collection item" phase and I can't exactly say it's anything close to fun.
---
&gt;Putting Fractal mechanic on open world. Let people learn stuff a bit. instead of jumping right into T4 which is crazy to see many uninformed people joining the run
---
That is what T1-T2-T3 is for.
---
You’re in the wrong because you need to blur out tags when posting content like this because reddit has an extremely strict no-witch-hunting policy in place for liability and in some cases legal reasons. Gw2 tags aren’t like steam or blizzard and you can directly identify an account with just the name alone.
---
You can get a subreddit banned for posting content like this, especially if it gets out of hand.
---
Reading is elitist as well so it seems.
---
Deltaconnect is the creator of an add on/overlay that can be used to see party dps, boons, and other information that's very helpful for raiders and other end game players who want to improve their performance. There is also a build template system that allows you to save what gear you're wearing, your traits and skills, and legendary item stats so that you can quickly re-load those later. It allows players who perform multiple roles to be able to swap in between encounters without asking everyone to wait for five minutes as they tediously navigate menus. It's also very helpful for people like myself who have trouble remembering dozens of builds across all the classes they play, so we don't also have to consult a website to match the build every time (and risk forgetting some gear/skill/trait changes).
---
The reason the existing build templates are through a third party is that gw2 has never had an official build template system, but they will be introducing one at the end of October. Unfortunately for players who have been enjoying the convenience of arcdps (delta's add-on), the official ones will have a strict cap of how many builds can be saved, and even that will cost gems to unlock. It's an unsatisfactory system compared to what already exists due to how few builds can be saved (especially gear), that swapping gear across characters requires the template to be deleted, and because it will now cost what is estimated to be a significant amount of gems.  
---
Arcdps templates will be shut down tomorrow so that they don't compete with the new system which is more sudden than people were expecting.
---
Hope that info is helpful!
---
You’re not reading what I said. Commander and diviner are stats for a BOON chrono. Not the DPS chrono who switches from zerk to zerk/sim based on having spotter or not.
---
Try reading my post again.
---
As for spotter vs no-spotter DPS chrono, it’s a chunk, but no where NEAR the difference of tank/off tank. Iirc, it’ll be closer to 2-3k (with perfect rotation), since you’d be building for having spotter (which is like 95% of the time imo with pugs)... and losing that hurts your crit, which is HUGE on chrono, since the stat transfers to phantasms, but not percent based (like sigil of accuracy). 
---
I know my shit mate. Trust me.
---
[or, you can look at this photo... that I also sent you in another reply.](https://imgur.com/a/nPkn0G2) about how I was a source for chrono information.
---
Edit: since it’s been a hot minute, I went to check... sure enough, they put the build now for dps chrono power as the “nonspotter” variant, as it’s probably easier to cover with just a food swap. I’m curious now of the full/majority zerker that I remember and will be doing math on it.
---
Basically, they did what I said above, but I took the full zerk, and took the hit, where they took the hybrid, and took a hit, because easier to swap food. 
---
SC still does not list all of the chrono options (and actually removed their toughness variant from power boon, since people were numbnuts all the time and only ran that), because there is too many. They also do not include other builds, simply because they don’t have enough bosses that they “win” on vs other builds (case being scepter mirage).
---
Start going to golem with a timer to see how fast people can kill it before inviting them to raid LmAo

It's a screenshot of his toon and he says he's going to farm.

The post has zero value.
---
One big thing is also that they're hugely hugely profitable compared to other things. No matter how enjoyable something is, it still will mostly die off if it's not competitive in rewards
---
Hey! Amazing to hear someone from Anet asking for feedback! Fractals are one of my favorite content.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;What aspects of these keep you coming back?
---
Long term untradeable rewards. CM 100 Infusion for example, actually shows your determination with hard PvE content. 
---
&gt;What do you wish was different?
---
I love the Fractals overall, however it is getting stale running same CMs year after year. Thats why idk if it counts for different, but would love to have Challenge Modes added to other fractals, or with new fractals. I imagine that adding something to content that is already there, isnt too developer time consuming.
---
&gt;What could we have done better?
---
Perhaps some difference or "RNG". When the fights arent exactly the same every time, it will make it feel less static. Fractal instabilities are great for it for eg, but maybe something little extra. Perhaps some different corridors open at different times, like in that mole fractal with 2 doors and either robot or ice cube final boss.
---
Also; No one plays Super Mario for final boss that is as hard as first map. It has to get gradually harder, or add CMs more often. I would have loved to see deepstone having one with "Fall and die" kind of mechanic from Qadim CM.
---
&gt;What did we do well?
---
Athmosphere and CM100 actually taking time to learn and forcing you to practice. Longterm reward such as special infusion is great touch as well, that could be needed elsewhere in the game more often as well.
---
The feeling of mastery. Because of the difficulty of these CMs, there's a feeling of pride (and satisfaction eh) that comes with being able to clear them. Conveying that an enemy is powerful through story and context and animation and sound is good and all, but conveying it through gameplay by having them kick your ass a couple of times is oh so effective. It feels good to triumph over them, it feels good to do it again and see how better you've become.
---
Honestly, not much besides having more of them. I'd love to see more variety in what's being required of the players (boon rip, reflects, stealth, healing, whatever) but the ones that are there do this very well, we just have few so the range they cover is limited.
---
On a more general note, all boss encounters in the game would feel grander if particle effects from the player's attacks were not affected by the target's size. There's a couple where the scaling looks good, but those are the exception. This is likely way outside the topic.
---
Difficult fractals don't currently feel like a very supported aspect of the game. It's been a while since anything was added for it. Even relatively small updates would go a long way towards alleviating that feeling.
---
Daily rewards for doing the CMs mean it's a lot easier for new players to find someone to do it with. Players will try to gatekeep one another but it's a lot easier to talk your way into a group that's already doing the thing you want to do than it is to organize a group from the grounds up.
---
if it counts for anything i'm a native english speaker and I can't make heads or tails of what this sentence means
---
I've gotta see what he looks like now, then, if he's even more styling.
---
&gt;They could have sustained themselves with an expansion
---
Not really. It was taking 3-4 months to put out those "low-effort story releases" as you put it. An expansion would've taken years at that rate with the skeleton crew that was assigned to the game.
---
If you want to blame someone, blame Mike O'Brien for trying to dump the Guild Wars franchise and moving the majority of the studio to new projects.

---
So, build for no spotter and there, you lose 100 power at best...
---
A dps class has what, 4k power when buffed? 100 power is 0,25%. lets say 0,5%.
---
So, if you build for no spotter you lose literally 170 DPS (IF you can hit the 34k bench, which noone does in a live raid).
---
If you give me your exact stats i can calculate for you the real number, which is between 100 and 200 dps.
---
How much money do you make by crying in the forums?

Good old FFXIV, where build templates are such a core feature, they're even [featured in the cinematic trailers.](https://youtu.be/4tyuIh12_HU?t=195)
---
All of my opinions are expressed in this comment!
---
People need to understand that capitalism itself is predatory.
---
"Ugh there's that buzzword "pReDaToRY". As if any monetization is an affront to the noble working class."
---
This is why I went to FFXIV. Just one monthly sub for pretty much everything.
---
Screw ToS. If what I'm doing doesn't affect anyone else then I'm going to keep doing it. I mod my UI in FFXIV too and that's against the ToS. If a company bans me for modding in convenience/a better UI then that's a customer they have lost, simple as that.

---
sword is very good. current meta comp for endgame pve is sword/axe and greatsword. sword and dagger are kinda interchangable in the main hand slot. longbow is a bit shit dps wise, but it does make open world content a lot easier and safer for new players
---
Isn't this hilarious though?  Build templates give nothing to the casuals who sit in one or two builds and doesn't do anything for those of us who've spent countless hours optimizing 10-20 builds across 2-3 classes.
---
I swapped to FFXIV months ago. "Game free" is such a cancer within this communist. They could literally send me a pile of shit in the mail (and ask me to pay for it) and this community would tell me to be happy because "it's a free game".
---
What do you mean? The game is really good. New Lions Arch is the best thing they've done in years. We get to stand around AFK. What other game has such great content? 
---
We get regular raid updates, and great PvP balance, and Anet's most loved gamemode of WvW has really come far since release. All skills are nicely split between gamemodes.
---
  
---
For PvE we have heaps of great fractal content that are diverse and fun with all the instabilities. There are even some really challenging things to do and they give valuable rewards like a rare unidentified gear. 
---
We also get awesome new creatures every release, like new hydras, spiders and earth elementals with their own custom models. 
---
Don't you know? We also have the very best underwater combat, it has a really big emphasis in the story and is integrated well with cool weapon skins that are released every few months. Underwater combat is so much fun, you can do big damage and use every single skill underwater, its also really fun to explore the map even for just a few iron ore. 
---
I really love doing achievements too, you get really cool rewarding titles and it's really impactful with timegates that make you feel like you've finally got there for 1 AP. 
---
The land combat system is great too, we get to have so many skills and it's really accessible for people because you can play how you want but still kill everything. They've even come out with new hard content called strikes, but you don't have to worry because you can still play how you want and kill it. 
---
They also really support their content creators by always giving them shoutouts and support on their streams and other media outlets. They've also optimised the game performance a lot so that anyone can run the game really well. They really make great level expansion content too, now known as the Icebrood saga, that will really help the game thrive by getting lots of income. This means that the future is only great for the game. 
---
They also made a second set of cool legendary skins and released heaps of them like they said they would during HoT. The game is also easy to get into, we have this top tier LFG system that is empty so that you can find what you're looking for easily. There's also this good introductory tutorial into game mechanics like the CC bar. 
---
Did you also see? They also had the best marketing campaign out of all games where they quoted players and put them on billboards and lots of people love that so we get lots of new players into the game. Each gamemode also has like heaps of different build variety, like WvW zergs have so much variety, there's firebrand and scourges, it's just absolutely amazing at the amount of combinations you can see, PvE is also the same with a tonne of variety, chrono, firebrand and renegade for instance.
---
There's also heaps of maps like edge of the mists which are really well populated and especially the living story episode maps which have their own currency! They also have cool things to do like use previous masteries from HoT in them.
---
Once you've played the game long enough you can also get tomes of knowledge to level your other characters up for great levelling up rewards, you even get the joy of clicking the tome every time to level up one. It's also a very lenient game in accidentally deleting items because you have to type them out before you can delete the very important items. 
---
They release content very well too, like raids come out about once a year which is very good already. WvW is also very competitive if that is your cup of tea, everyone is trying very hard to capture keeps and towers for good rewards, it's also balanced well and they like to put a lot of invisible walls to prevent cheating and jumping into keeps. There's also this WvW alliance thing they have announced really recently so that we can play with your guild mates! 
---
PvP is also a great gamemode, Anet hates cheaters and actively bans a lot of them in ban waves, especially the bots. There's cool class balance as well that they regularly do to rein in the overpowered and cheese builds. 
---
The Gw2 story is overall also really well written, with lots of characters you can get emotionally invested in. &gt;!Like Aurene who unfortunately met her demise!&lt; and it really felt like we had no hope at all. 
---
Anet gives great notice for their updates too, and always tells us what they want their end goal to be with a really detailed roadmap of what they want from the game. On top of all of that there's great gemstore content too which gives cool things like minature chairs for cats and now the awaited build templates!
---
Gear juggling just to play a content. Is pretty meh. Spending hour to fix especailly moving infusion is a big content block.
---
And is free in every other mmo ever?
---
Lmao if they ban me then that's a lost customer, simple as that.
---
I'm hoping so, but I cant find anything specifically stating so, and since it says you get two per character and they come immediately filled with whatever we were wearing I'm worried that wont be the case
---
I'm entitled for not wanting to pay for a basic feature in a game that I paid for?
---
you had me in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Then just exchange gems to gold if you don't enjoy farming ingame?
---
You worded it perfectly, thanks. It's amazing how much better FFXIV is these days. I pay like £7 a month and get every single feature for free. On GW2 that £7 would get me, what? One bag slot? No thanks.
---
an equipment template will be per character yes, but since your gear is stored god knows where when it's in a template I'm assuming that a specific armor set/piece can be a part of multiple templates on various characters. Otherwise the whole system would be a bit fucky
---
**What aspects of these keep you coming back?**
---
a) rewards and tiny chance for infusion. make more long-term rewards!
---
b) it being a fractal and not a raid, i like using consumables, fractal potions, sigils and potions "of slaying"
---
c) the difficulty is acceptable, could be harder honestly. challenge is exciting, if it's too easy it's boring. safer to go for harder than easier, people will eventually trivialize it anyway.
---
e) room for optimization and interactive play. people are competing for fastest boss times, in my static we have a table of CC values that we put for every breakbar so we have it done immediately. lots of theorycrafting. also combat mechanics being useful such as reflects, boon strips, aegis, portals, stability, resistance.
---
**What do you wish was different?**
---
a) remove instabilities, or make them optional for more relics. solidify the experience so it's repeatable. my group can't do boss speed kill attempts when we have certain instabilities, because it's making the outcomes worse than usual.
---
b) it would be nice to have respawn and mistlock close to new bosses, similar to arkk or skorvald. 
---
c) i wish people could stack on capture points to cap faster.
---
**What could we have done better?**
---
a) arkk encounter applies night effects on weapons, but night sigils don't work. that's inconsistent. it would be really great if in patch notes the new fractal would have mentioned exactly what slaying sigil and potion will work in this fractal and if it's day or night. also solidify the enemy types into just one for entire fractals, like you did in arah - inquest still count as undead there. it's useful, practical, saves time. still not sure if siren's reef uses ghost slaying (and if yes, for what mobs specifically)
---
b) release CMs more often, turn other fractals into CM. 
---
c) be careful about mobs removing conditions from themselves - condi builds are already crippled by bursty nature of fractals. if you make mobs just remove all bleeding/burning/poison, you cancel the entire dps of that person.
---
c) (more of a side note) rework siren's reef - make the ghosts despawn after labyrinth is complete, fix combat bug, shorten the duration of conditions from mobs.
---
d) checkpoints in fractals in general really need some "squad message" popup on screen when they are unlocked. many people don't even know you have a new ressing spot after grawl shaman starts triggering the 2nd event in Volcanic. many people dont know when you pass certain spot in Cliffside you unlock a new checkpoint. 
---
**What did we do well?**
---
a) you didn't turn it into raids. if you lock consumables, make boons disappear, all that - i will probably stop enjoying fractals. it's just taking away layers and layers of difficulty and optimisation. let people be tryhards
---
b) introducing a trophy for 100CM so people can measure experience and look for certain amounts of the KP in people, to make life easier in lfg
---
I need it to continue to play their game and support their business by buying gems for skins every month. That's all that should matter.
---
unofficial pvp content*
---
"you fucking idiot"
---
&gt;Expansions can't be built on a skeleton crew. 
---
That's the point. It was never realistic for them to create an expansion with the limited resources assigned to GW2 at the time.
---
Now however, with ArenaNet seemingly wholly dedicated to GW2, it would seem feasible to at least break ground on an expansion once LS5 is fully underway. But again, there hasn't yet been the time to develop an expansion between now and aforementioned layoffs.
---
In essence, that's why the "just make an expansion" narrative falls apart. And why if people really are desperate for someone to blame for the "state" GW2 is in, they should point their pitchforks towards Mike O'Brien, not ArenaNet.
---
longbow//sword/axe is meta for a lot of fights in fractals.
---
250 ping anything is aids
---
Only thing I don't like is the rng in the currency, especially since it counts as kp. Also should be for 99 cm as well or each their own.
---
You just described why monthly subs will always be better than "buy to play"... I shouldn't have to pay for basic features.
---
Although overwatch is buy to play and I didn't have to pay for basic features in that... HOTS was good and that constantly gets features for free.
---
Not just talking about it. Charging us for it and expecting us to be grateful...
---
I dunno bud I saw him but I didn't really get to know him like I did this past season, yknow? Like, really know what his deal is and what he's Like
---
Yeahhhh that seems illegal...
---
Bingo. It's pretty common to bump into someone who doesn't have AcrDPS installed, which can be understandable and people can get over. But when literally every player in the game has access to at least some form of build templates...then everyone is going to be "required" to use the system.
---
If anything the elitism levels are going to go up. *"What, you can't afford to buy all the build template slots for each of your 15 characters? Plebeian scrub."*
---
Would be nice if we had a system like GW1 where you could easily transfer regions whenever you wanted.
---
The WvW situation will hopefully be fixed in the future with the new system so you can scratch that out.
---
The rest you will have to decide on your own but i would rate being able to play when you want, what you want with more people the highest.
---
Ugh, the EU sounds like such a hassle.  Good on Brexit.  :)
---
The people saying they would pay are not the same people that are upset at being asked to pay...
---
&gt; Other mmo’s have them and nothing toxic I’ve seen from them yet.
---
It seems you didn't experience the horrific early days of "Gear Score" in WoW.
---
Really? Talk about grasping at straws...
---
Thanks so much for your work. Fractals are pretty much the only content I still play, and fractals CMs are definitely the only content I truly enjoy.
---
What keeps me coming back?
---
Difficulty and personal responsibility. In raids (and in general) The more players in the group the more diminished the importance of the individuals execution becomes.
---
In regards to difficulty, the fast-paced nature makes use of the action combat system of gw2. There are many attacks to avoid or mitigate. One after the other. Dynamically moving from one attack to the next.
---
What do I wish was different?
---
More CMs. Ideally a CM for every fractal if possible. Obviously rewards structure would need to change. Perhaps limit availability of CM rewards to the 3 daily fractals. The key take away, is I want more challenging group content, specifically 5 man content.
---
What could you have done better?
---
The integration of fractal/boss mechanics and the random instabilities. I feel like the fights were tuned and design well, but then a bunch of instability garbage gets dumped on top. A boss may demand particular movement and positioning, but then the instability makes that movement impossible, you end up with an unenjoyable mess.
---
What could you do better?
---
Limit the number of attacks that hit multiple times (shock waves that hit 3 times all with knockback and conditions) or attacks that inflict multiple conditions which then couple with instabilities that inflict multiple conditions. The multi hit attacks make aegis and some other counter-play useless. Stacking of conditions and effects becomes overwhelming and heavily favours certain classes and skills.
---
What did you do well?
---
So much. My concerns with CM99s original release have been remedied with various updates. As it is, I really enjoy nightmare. If it weren't for the randomness instabilities add to the fractal, I would say it is excellently designed. It might be a little easy for organised groups to breeze through with high dps, but I think that is a worthwhile trade-off to keep it achievable for PUGs and the broader gw2 player base.
---
Sword is obviously a problem, and I wouldn't be shocked to see it nerfed as well.
---
But knowing Anet, they'll probably nerf Daredevil and completely miss the mark. I'll hope for the best, since that's all you can do when it comes to this company.
---
How do I get started with fractals? I've been playing pretty sporadically since its release but I only recently got more interested in doing some endgame things like raids and fractals. Thanks!
---
I agree completely. I don't have an issue with prestige super rare drops, despite my typical irritation with RNGs. In an mmo, rng makes sense to create prestige of certain things. But in return, that item needs to have the quality and design of something worth that value. So, for example, if an item is double the price of a legendary, it should deserve legendary status. 
---
This is a fucking cultural skin. Not only is the idea of "cultural armor" something the community has wanted for years, but it's also a super limited use item. Second to that, it's pretty basic skin. It looks like something along the lines of sunspear armor at best. There's nothing *wrong* with that. I love me some basic looking armor, but the value should reflect that. In other words, the fact that this item is prestigious and rare is arbitrary. Its only valuable on any level, because it *is* artificially made that way. This is an item, that should have been a part of the basic progression of doing the achievements in the map. It could have been, for instance, a side quest only available to start by a charr in the map. 
---
This map has a low quantity and quality of rewards. We have the emote, which is excellent, and the microphone. There's also a t-shirt, and 3 fucking reskins of the same backpiece. The content is good, so it gets a pass, but the reward structure is pretty barren. So they have this set of weapons, a chair, a shoulder piece, and a fucking cultural armor skin (not including the infusion). None of these are particularly spectacular in comparison to the other skins within their same category, even within other living story releases. But all of these were sectored off to super low RNG drops, rather than integrated into some sort of persistent progression reward structure seen in other maps. The weapons are basically valued around cheap black lion weapons, and the chair and visage are at ludicrous drop rates. The effect this has is that the vast majority of players will just not see these at all and they are arbitrarily made more exclusive without really deserving that. It also leaves the map bare of any interesting rewards or goals. It's more valuable to just sell the keys and those skins are not fuckin worth the value the rng has given them. And it totally makes sense why some people would be pissed off about it.
---
Also the achievement tied to all that horse shit is a fucking joke. You get the god damned t-shirt, which you can already buy for a reasonable price, as the reward. Why? The only thing this tells me is that they just rushed this shit and had to cobble the rewards with what they had. They seriously couldn't swing for a slightly different version of the shirt? It's nonsense.
---
Maces have more CC because their daze/stun is affected by the Paralyzation sigil while the Hammer's launch/knockdown isn't.

i prefer dagger in open world pve just for the bit of quickness from skill 3 which is fairly spammable bc it's ammo based. but idk if OP has PoF so. moa stance makes that 5 seconds of quickness too, it's really nice. use that twice and Quickening Zephyr + the merged F3 ability and you got a loooot of quickness
---
It looks really great! It makes me happy to see so much art around! Keep it up
---
What's 'CM' here? Combat mode?
---
This is sadder than all the red shirt NPCs Anet introduced solely so they could be killed off combined. Rest in peace build templates, you'll be missed.

Is there anyway to export those builds in arcdps build templates?
---
Pretty potent food for power dps classes. Used to be the best food for a long time until a recent update that gave us ascended food. Still a good option for those who want to save a bit of gold.
---
Why just 2? Might as well put 3 legendary backpacks + Gift of Gift of Fortune Fortune.
---
Challenge Mote/Mode.
---
Thank you for posting! I would totally just auto-pilot and buy the mapping mats without looking, bless you
---
Used to be the best food for power DPS. With the introduction of ascended food https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cilantro_Lime_Sous-Vide_Steak gives the same stat and slightly more damage plus healing while being cheaper for the same duration. 
---
The only advantage this recipe still holds is flexibility. If you only need 30 minutes or less worth of buff then part of the ascended food's 1 hour duration is being wasted.
---
Some people just want the recipe for completionist reason as well.
---
heh "both"
---
Honestly, I had the same idea. But I have no idea how to visualize that, let alone create it (since I’m also terrible at photoshop). Warbringer already looks like a clusterfuck itself. Which completely fits the theme by the way.  
---
But yes absolutely, combining all three would be perfect.
---
All I can say is if two of you were chasing one guy around for an extended period of time you both did something wrong and the three other members of your team carried you. So you did something wrong, he did the exact same thing wrong. Cap the point and rotate, if one of you is either a bunker or on a stronger 1v1 spec they can stay so long as the Rev is hanging around. But ultimately while you're chasing the Rev around the rest of your team is playing 3v4.
---
However, the other player was just an ass and I doubt he was any better than you, probably worse.
---
Oh, I see from where they come to wvw. Also there is variation for condi de. 
---
It's sad when players follow meta and only use broken build. If they think this is fun - they wrong. It's pathetic. 
---
Well just try to use contrbuild with more resistance, it's work for me.
---
People definitely do this, and I can see how cost effective it could be, but I am sceptical that it is used by the majority of permanent tool owners.
---
/salute
---
It's impossible to see, I can't pause at it and it's never bright enough to make out.
---
ok so since that kinda hits what im doing, I have something around 5000 hours played in this game. its doing so many things wrong that I havent really actively played in a long time, but ofc i hang around to see if it gets better? and ofc i point out issues I have, that's literally the point of a reddit forum.
---
Eukaryan caves, you see a heart. It's the heart that turns you into a pig to dig up and find truffles. Ignore that heart, there's a small puddle to the side, you dive in and swim all the way down, leads you to a long underwater tunnel. Keep swimming and viola!
---
Indeed and it is also for the map I show. Cheers.
---
The depth. The challenge.the cm’s. The daily rewards.
---
Your utility skills are now weapon skills.
---
Yes, that contributes to overall gold earning. 
---
Of course if You need T6 for crafting or legendaries just keep them, you still earn the value, just not turn it into gold, and avoid TP tax.
---
Yep :'c
---
There's gonna be a patch tomorrow with whatever new halloween cosmetics and crap are added. These often break the core ArcDPS mod, which has the hooks for the template add-on in there. Delta can just remove the template mod hooks and there is no alternative - ArcDPS is busted and won't run at all, or update and use the new version w/o templates.
---
Can you buy boosters similar to the celebration booster or some that have at least 50%-100% magic find?
---
Or is there a way to farm such boosters? What's the most efficient way in getting them?
---
&gt; why are trait/skill templates not just saved locally
---
Because someone will pay a lot of money to store a text string on their servers.
---
I love the shortbow shortbow bleeder build
---
Thank you for everything y4red, it was so interesting !
---
since the questions are too similar, imma split them differently
---
&gt; the good:
---
they are some of the few instances of challenging content left in fractals with very few fluff events between the fights
---
especially 100cm is quite unique in terms of mechanics
---
not having to run around chasing the bosses for literally no reason except to pointlessly prolong the fight helps too(looking at you deepstone, siren, molten rework etc.)
---
&gt; the bad:
---
in 99cm overall and at artsariiv, there are a bunch of orange circles and lines and stuff you are supposed to avoid..but the visual noise is crazy and even given the fact i can avoid all of them easily with positioning, i still dislike their existence
---
 i wanna play gw2 not dance dance revolution with aoe indicators..bring back dodging as a core part of the gameplay!
---
*When fighting against Kralk it is very advisable to not ever climb up onto him with mounts. Instead, you can use the leylines that spawn after a weakpoint is destroyed or simply port to one of the 3 shrines which are located NW, SW and SE of the event area to reach weakpoints that are on top of him. The shrines can be used ANYTIME! Even when you are in combat or in downstate!*
---
Thanks for this. I didn't know about the leylines.
---
If you're new I honestly suggest against going for the skyscale it's a long tedious grind
---
ironically in sept people shitted on me for playing cthief. oh how the times change..
---
[Build templates in a few hours.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N28OUyR96o0)
---
for example in a circus
---
Litterally thief that is useful in PvE = Rev
---
Ok. How is Anet milking ppl? There is no p2w content. There is no QoL Item on TP that u cant buy after few days of doing fractals. Only thing u need to buy are expansions. Seems very user friendly to me.  Can u give me an example of game that does it better?
---
... which means an engi is perfect.  :-/
---
It's kinda even more confusing now, idk man
---
Just link them to wiki article "Schizophrenia" and say "this, but mages in armor with swords".
---
Rip QoL of account items sounds like it’ll be even more annoying to transfer stuff around
---
I dont see how changing asc gear between characters will become any worse to handle than it is right now.
---
That sucks, because All or Nothing is definitely worth buying a few gems (gold or money) to play through.
---
In case you are fine with it there is the very good (but a bit lengthy) guide [Fractal Zero to Fractal Hero](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bt-vFeeLAeEsaoz72bkc4ZODsudIQ2hiQdvSnFYLtw/edit) that you might find interesting.
---
You don't need to read it all before jumping in at all: the introduction and the part about T1 Fractals are plenty enough to get you started with the basics.
---
Only if the patch breaks it, which isn't guaranteed. At least that's what I understood from one of the delta's replies. But on 29th it will definitely stop working.
---
Cry more. If your builds were that good, you'd remember them. I've been manually swapping my builds and gear because my computer couldn't support 3rd party programmes. So what if that monetise native build templates? So what if it's maxed out at 6 or so per toon? I'd just appreciate it is a thing now and it seems to be a faster and inventory convenient way for toons with a lot of gear.
---
There are already two entire sets of legendary armor you can get without ever setting foot in a raid lol
---
Hello! I'm really glad to see your comment. Thank you and other devs so much for Nightmare and Shattered fractals! CM versions of them are my favorite instanced content in the game, the best thing to play daily with a group of friends.
---
&gt;What aspects of these keep you coming back? 
---
Them being 5-ppl content with the most interesting and challenging boss fights. The necessity of good team composition, good team play and communication. Rewards are great too, both instant and long term.
---
&gt;What do you wish was different? 
---
I don't want anything different in 99 CM and 100 CM, they are beautifully designed already!
---
&gt;What could we have done better? 
---
In general — more fractals like Nightmare and Shattered, with complex and rewarding challenge mode of course! 
---
More specific — team composition. All bosses in current 99&amp;100 CMs do have a lot of phases, which is a great design by itself, but it heavily dictates the superiority of power DPS groups. When it comes to effectiveness — there is no room for condi builds here, because all conditions on bosses are simply being erased with each phase. I don't know how to solve this properly, but it would have been great to see condi comps shine in these encounters as well.
---
Another wish is more about classes balance than fractal design, but I'll share it nonetheless — it would have been great to effectively play with chrono and some boon-(healer) class as supports. Firebrand and renegade are outclassing anything else by far in terms of boons and support, that is the only effective option right now. The reason for it is that the only reliable boon chrono can provide now is quickness, and less reliable is alacrity. Groups with chrono do need one more support class, which will provide everything else needed. And the important part of achieving composition diversity is to do so not by nerfing firebrand to the ground, but by presenting another boon class, capable to provide what is necessary for effective team performance.
---
One more thing — please, make the Celestial infusions look as cool as Starborn outfit. These two infusions are great rewards, one being rare and expensive, and the other one being a long term prize. But their texture looks underwhelming compared to what you did with that outfit and some mount skins.
---
&gt;What did we do well? 
---
There are so many excellent aspects! The visual design of locations, bosses, the lore, the voice acting and music — everything is truly splendid, as you guys always deliver. Complex boss fights that require teamplay, class knowledge, execution of different mechanics such as globolla, bullet hell, anomalies, and others. There is a lot of depth in these fights, and I realize it while becoming better as a player — it feels amazing and rewarding.
---
Another big part is our ability to use consumables from inventory, as well as specific slaying potions and sigils. It adds a lot to these fights. And rewards for 99&amp;100 CM fractals are balanced and just, especially when you do them both daily.
---
Thank you again for this beautiful content, and please do more!
---
I main a rev and the renegade spec is versatile in both pve and pvp
---
The only problem I have with condi thief is that they are annoying to fight. Less annoying then mirage but still annoying. One main reason is of course their synergy with immob. I would rework this trait and give them something else that is nice but not annoying.
---
Overall I find them alot less over the top then spellbreaker with their iwin button and still holo. Playing holo myself I'd say the last nerf certainly was good but did not quite go far enough.
---
high five...this will be a fun month
---
Im getting equipment tabs which arc will never offer me. Also arc is 3rd party unsopported tool which for me is a deal breaker. I dont expect you to understand this reasoning, but I dont really care about it either.
---
Dont you get scaled to 80?
---
So you will not bounce
---
I like Nightmare fractal because it's basically 3 bosses in a row. 1 small event inbetween, but thats fine. The Fractal feels challenging and rewarding for doing it right, especially the Mama fight in CM. 
---
Shattered Observatory is cool because of the setting it plays in, the "void" like area. I like the Arkk fight and Skorv., but Viirastra is a little too much happening at the same time, too many AoE's to dodge at once, and a too big fighting area (imo).
---
Oh no! Someone wants to make money off their product? That's the most evil thing ever and a complete surprise! /s
---
we use portals between 1st and 2nd, 5th and 6th, 11th and 12th if a willing mesmer is available. since this isn't always the case we didnt include it in the post
---
you're welcome :)
---
Mad King's Labyrinth comes out tomorrow! make an engineer with a flamethrower or a power mirage mesmer with great sword and tag as many mobs you can. get trick or treat bags and horde them till you think prices are good to sell!
---
It was Free! and that was a great price!
---
Imagine labelling anyone who uses build templates as toxic.
---
Sadly it won’t work. Templates update after every adjustment. So if you remove a piece it will be removed for all templates on that character. You will have to place it back and reset it onto the other templates as well every time
---
Looks like a normal day in FF14
---
One could indeed skin a GW2 charr and use its hide as a source of light.
---
Thats for farming pinata or what?
---
Moar fractals and moar story. They are so much fun, would not mind some more variety or good looking gear to be gained.
---
People are free to have desires, but the question is, which takes priority?  Balance or build diversity?
---
This is the saddest thing I have ever seen
---
And orders them alphabetically. If you want to see your DPS then better rename your character to Aaaaaa My D P S.
---
&gt;custom maps
---
Oh my god, imagine if players could build their own fractals, Mario Maker style.
---
Hey Cameron! Thank you for the amazing fractals. 99CM is my favourite repeatable content in GW2. I even geared a character just for it.
---
The difficulty is just right for me. I think what makes Nightmare CM so enjoyable is the easy to grasp but hard to master *patterns*. You know MAMA's big swings kill you, but you need to learn the pattern. You know the red balls kill you, but you need to learn the pattern. You know Siax needs to be CC'ed, but... you know what I wanna say. Practicing this fractal and slowly getting better was a lot of fun. 
---
In the newer fractals on the other hand you get spammed with so many condis and mob attacks that you never really feel in control of the fight. It's harder to understand what you need to do better to win.
---
I akso like the CC phases in 99CM, for experienced players they're a great mechanic to play and gear around. The bullet hell brought something fresh and different to the game.
---
I also like that there's not a lot of walking or filler encounters. You just get to the interesting bosses. If you wipe, the checkpoints are right there and you can try the boss again. That's nice QoL.
---
&gt; If anything legendary = exclusive skin, been like that always
---
You have no idea how I agreed with that for many years and how I wish it was true. They released the game with legendaries that were pure cosmetics and the full price was for this and nothing else. Problem, they introduced stat-swap to compensate for wardrobe ... from a bonus perk, I'm afraid is DID become the main point of legendary, the skin being the bonus. For years I hoped they would release "blank legendaries" to allow cheaper stat swap and unlock build diversity, but on the contrary they made pvp/wvw armors that prove once and for all that now the full price is supposed to pay for stat swap, not skin.
---
&gt; What aspects of these keep you coming back? 
---
CMs. 99 and 100 really shine when you turn the CM on. It's fun, challenging and very repeatable. They also reward class/mechanic knowledge in a level you can't really see anywhere else.
---
&gt; What do you wish was different? 
---
Some of the thrash between fights in CM are redundant. After you've already learned the mechanics in the normal mode. If something new is added in the CM you should definitely introduce that through thrash.
---
&gt; What could we have done better? 
---
The fractals are tuned to the power level we had at their launch. After that much of stuff have been added to the game and the even the CMs fall of a little bit in difficulty. Bosses on both fractals could be tuned up a bit just to reflect the powercreep. 
---
Mistlock instabilities should be really looked into. I know they were reworked not long ago but honestly most of them are not making the fractals harder or more challenging but just more annoying. Then there are outliers like We bleed fire, last laugh and outflanked all at the same time in Siren's Reef. That fight in it self is horrendous with all the aoe spam from the ghosts etc. Some of the instabilities should never come up together. It's just a little too much rng at the moment that how fun the fractal run of the day will be.
---
&gt; What did we do well? 
---
Both 99 and 100 are "dungeon like". You work your way through to the finale to fight the ultimate evil at the end and the main emphasis on these are the "generals" of the end bosses. No boring rng puzzles (looking at you Deepstone). No artificially hard thrash encounters with a spam fest of AoE. The "generals" and bosses have clear attack patterns which rewards the player to know what is happening. 
---
Also the rewards in CMs are really really worth your time daily (Blue infusion dream is still alive).
---
Hey Cameron! Nice of you to drop by and collect feedback. I’ll try to keep things brief. 
---
**Latency Dependent Mechanics**
---
As a high latency player (350ms) my biggest peeve with fractal is mechanics that are latency dependent. The biggest offender here is Nightmare bullet hell. 
---
I can get used to telegraphs from big attacks, I can get used to dodging pre emptively, I can even avoid the red balls,  but the one thing I still have trouble with is getting blue healing balls in the Nightmare fractal. At best I can only get 1-2 by collecting them in a full frontal fashion. If the blue balls enter my cap zone that doesn’t allow me to collect them in that fashion, gg me. While regular 99 is fine (I can solo cap them), 99CM is very deadly for me. Often I pray that I don’t get kicked from this handicap. 
---
To a lesser extent the second offender would be Deepstone glowing tiles, the one before the Air Elemental Sentinel. Amusingly despite my high latency I’m usually the among the two players required to deactivate the floors. Some players refuse to even attempt it. 
---
**Shattered Observatory Fractal**
---
The only improvement for regular 100 Fractal would be to have an option to skip the dialogue after the initial run. Some of my pugs lash out at poor Yoko in frustration having to hear her for the umpteenth time lol. 
---
Now 100CM, that’s my favourite Fractal overtaking my long time love for 99CM. Even with my high latency I never feel handicapped in the CM like I do in 99CM. This is mainly due to the well implemented Special Action Skill. It’s also amazing that 100CM cuts all dialogues from regular 100. 
---
**Daze Happy**
---
Dazes happen way too often in Fractal, from AoEs to mobs to instabilities... it’s not fun to be interrupted all the time when our own stability cd can’t keep up with the frequency of incoming stuns and dazes. This makes FB Support more meta than ever. IMO it was a bad thing to nerf reliable Stability source from Druid. 
---
**Teleporting Bosses**
---
Eg. Deepstone boss, revamped Molten Furnace boss. Delays from invulnerable frames and chasing the boss around the area is just artificially prolonging the Fractal. Creates a frustrating experience. 
---
Honourable mentions: Dredge miniboss in Underground Facility and the Urban Battleground boss that blocks with shield. So it’s just a waiting game until they lower the shield, not fun. It would be better if the blocking is a break bar and breaking the bar will cause the mob to lower its shield. That will feel more interactive gameplay wise. 
---
**Twilight Oasis**
---
When this fractal was launched I spent 2 hours fighting Amala, cycling through pugs joining and leaving. It took a while, but the fractal grew on me. I would like to praise the Special Action Key leap here and how it’s designed to counter Flux Bomb. That’s one of the most fun thing to do in TO, so thanks!
---
One of the loudest critism on TO is the trash mob phase. Thanks to the ingenuity of some creative players, their skips had helped make this more bearable. 
---
**Siren Reef**
---
The universally hated fractal. It’s too long, too mobby (but without loot drop) and the maze part is totally unnecessary after the first time. Actually I’d say the same for Deepstone maze part too. I’m just no fan of artificial difficulties. 
---
The Skeleton boss fight is great, frantic and deadly if not managed well. The cannon phase on the ship is nice to break up phases. The boss fights are fine albeit the visual clutter could use some reduction. 
---
My only beef is that Sugar Rush happens way too often in this fractal that it started feel like the instabilities are not random, where some has more weight to be chosen for certain fractals. It’s almost like Last Laugh for Cliffside fractal. As if certain fractals are always paired with the worst instabilities for them. 
---
**Social Awkwardness**
---
This is my least favourite instability. High performing pugs (the ones doing near benchmark dps) had similarly expressed dislike over this instability too. Heck I even prefer the previous SA, at least it won’t mess with teammates as much as new SA. 
---
**Revamped Underwater Fractal**
---
I have to say I’m not a fan. The boss fight itself isn’t difficult, just that the mobs are so tanky plus invulnerable phases that it makes the fractal too long. IMO the three phases is kinda overkill. A max of two would’ve been better. The excessive frequency of incoming condi damage also makes support FB crucial here. 
---
**Suggestions**
---
In the future I would love to see fractal rewards scale with difficulty. Keep current rewards as baseline but increase rewards for the harder, newer fractals. It doesn’t have to be CM like lucrative, but just enough to mitigate the bad feeling of spending more effort for the same rewards. For example, after a long day I typically skip doing Siren and Mai Trin fractal. It’s just not worth it. 
---
Lastly, I’m glad you’re still with Anet Cameron. You’re my favourite dev ❤️
---
Short comic that was inspired by latest LW prologue. :)
---
I play one hour a day. Three months passed and I was able to complete only half ..... To much grind
---
Yes.
---
A couple of days.
---
Seriously, do whatever the fuck you feel like doing. Get lost in the world.
---
trust me i saw them doing same skills in a minimum of millisecond , guess its a micro
---
&gt; The expansions have to be bought with real money
---
I'm pretty sure I saw the expac in the store?
---
I remember trying it in my alt acc back in the day, and I recall what i just said. Lots of missed hits, mobs aggro you heavily and you die quick. But i can't say for sure about thw scaling.. don't know
---
I see a lot of people commenting "good mechanics" but never pointing out *why* they are good. I feel the crucial point here is that you can't just ignore them, stack stab and block and dps.
---
Too many encounters are just a stack fest burning through the hp of the boss until it dies.
---
It is to much to "point it out"
---
If you can’t carry those just vendor them
---
What is this scale weights icon on the map?
---
https://imgur.com/a/pKYLchJ
---
(right next to the Thaumanova Reactor)
---
Aren't they consumables though? I consumed them.
---
&gt; it is blocked
---
I'm afraid, if the wiki and Dulfy are blocked for you, chances are high you shouldn't be playing the game on that network as well. (Sounds like one of the dumb filters for some schools in the US, am I right?)
---
I suggest to either get some proper access (phone with data plan maybe), or if you play the game anyway on that network, learn how to circumvent those dumb filters. It is usually a piece of cake, and you'll learn something useful in the process as well (about computer networking).
---
well this is also 100% banable
---
&gt;What aspects keep you coming back
---
In Nightmare I like the varying enemy mechanics (the vomiting always amuses me, and is satisfying to get right) and dodging the agony balls. The ball dodging is hard, and somehow I hit them even when I think my character is skinny enough to fit through the gaps, but it's fun to get right.
---
The end boss is Nightmare is fun to kill (see above) and the very clear telegraphs are lovely.
---
I look forward to doing Nightmare, because I like the aesthetic and that it is consistent throughout, but mostly I like getting a glimpse of Living World Season 1 as I never got a chance to play it.
---
Shattered Observatory. I come back to this one less often, as it feels a lot longer than other fractals.
---
I really enjoy the Viistra bouncy ball fight, it's hard (did it at T4 for the first time the other day and it was so hard, I couldn't finish it) but satisfyingly so.
---
I go back to shattered as I like the story and characters in it, the things Viistra says make me chuckle, and I like the big-fear-eye mechanic in the endboss.
---
In Nightmare I would like more context about what is happening in the fractal, cause I'm not super sure what's happening in it, and I would like the balls to be easier to dodge. 
---
I can't think of what I would have different, I like Nightmare.
---
I'd enjoy more of the trippy sequences, that's always cool.
---
In Shattered, I think that it could be shorter. I understand that it's the end of the fractal story so I get why it's lengthy, but I feel that it could do without the Skovald guy. I'm not sure why he's there, he's fun to fight but I prefer the other two bosses. I'd suggest to have more of an explanation of where he came from, or have us chase him through the mists as he tears stuff apart, or something to speed up the fractal, maybe we chase him to Viistra who kills him.
---
A thought on Shattered: as the story has progresses, and we have [something that happens in LW season 4](#s "Kralkatorrik and his minions flying through the mists") then we could have glimpses of him appearing, or some of [a particular enemy type](#s "his branded minions") appearing. That'd be cool.
---
&gt; What could we have done better?
---
Shortening the time it takes between the Boss becoming invulnerable and the next part of the fight starting. Maybe refreshing skills at the end of the ball dodging bit as well, so we're fresh for the fight again.
---
In Shattered I think the cooldown on the special skill could be shorter in the non-fight sections to speed up movement. Plus it's fun to use. pew pew!
---
&gt; What did we do well?
---
To be honest, I think you've done all of it very well. They're both fun in their own ways, Shattered is really challenging, whereas Nightmare has cooler visuals (personal taste). The enemies are cool, I like how mushed up Shattered feels.
---
Thank you for making these, and all fractals. They're a part of the game I really enjoy, and I feel lucky that the team and yourself are willing to receive feedback and make new fractals (I like siren's reef, I was excited when it came out, it's super hard but I enjoy doing it)
---
Nah, sorry. Rather play with Sublimatioo because this guy actually knows what he is doing.
---
you don´t need them in your inventory to place them.
---
Yesssssss
---
&gt; What do you wish was different?
---
I wish ArenaNet stopped ignoring the community and added CM modes for all fractals.
---
Yeah, full squad waiting for pinata while me and 2 other guys collecting coins....love this meta but AG is AG
---
They both give 100 power and 70 ferocity.  Same damage.
---
It means "more people can actually start playing" content, while only those who see it fitting will buy skins that do nothing, just support the company more.
---
A mixture of the difficulty and the Focus on bosses. The bosses exist in both a challenge mode and regular mode. The challenge mode is repeatable and rewarding, individual Player skill Comes into account here more than in some other fractals. 
---
Many fractals have annoying ads in between every Encounter, and the ads usually hit just as hard as the Boss. In nightmare, yes there are ads, but they are dealt with quickly.
---
The General concept of how each Boss and the "puzzle room" is preparing you for the final Encounter is simply amazing.
---
In nightmare and SO, honestly, I don't think much can be done to make them better than they already are. Keep the bugs away and fix em when they come up and I think everyones happy.
---
For most fractals, I think the ad parts are usually too Long. And boring. And I don't think adding more telegraphs and what not to make them more spiced up would make them better. 
---
What bothers me the most are instabilities. They exist and make it harder, not on a fair Level though, to clear specific fractals under specific instabilities. They took most of the fun away from fractals, honestly.
---
Rework instabilities. I am a bit out of track, so I cannot be specific on how they are done the best way, sorry. But I am sure there are many suggestions out there. Then for future fractals, Keep the filler parts short. Don't motivate the Players to skip 99% of it in a pug run, cause it usually causes more Trouble than just Clearing it. 
---
The Story is usually being told in a short manner for each fractal. But I am sure most of us agree that the more connected Approach Chaos/Nightmare/SO had was way better.
---
The connected Story of Chaos/Nightmare/SO is great. Do more of that! It doesn't have to go in depth. The Challenge modes are rewarding by giving additional loot. That's how it simply should be. Nobody repeats the challenge modes in raids frequently for no reason. In fractals they do. That's the reason. 
---
Otherwise, about all fractals, especially the newst since PoF are looking great. New mechanics are being included and that's great. Maybe consider adding gliding to new coming fractals, but that's just an indea.
---
Purple burping! That's awesome.
---
This is truly end-game content (honestly not being sarcastic)
---
go west a little, she's on the other side of the bridge.
---
You mean BDO that was criticised for being p2w and a cash grab? Damn am I sure glad anet has learned from the Asian MMOs.
---
No wonder this genre keeps losing market share. They all spend years trying to become a wow clone with little innovation of improvement... it's no suprise a literal relaunch of wow performs better due to nostalgia than half the other games in the genre.
---
Removing a third party tool to force a paid downgrade down our throats is a cash grab. Also wow allows a lot more mods than gw2 does.
---
The aesthetic was great, the boss fights were dynamic and unique, the use of the arena was really fun and it flowed really well all round great content (and rewards are great)
---
Dont play, you'll be fine.
---
I mean I'd say this is a reasonable time to uninstall.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
---
I mean, FFXIV also has an incredible toxic customer support solution for that kinda stuff. Being: "If you insult/attack people in your groups for not playing how they want to play you can get get banned for a time." On the other hand, you can totally take a run hostage by playing bad or RPing through it if you feel like it because, again, the system supports your decision.
---
Now thankfully (at least from my experience) it happens almost never but I was in voice with guildmates who had to deal with that and unless you have veeery good reasons it's neigh impossible to kick those kind of players from your runs without summoning GM retribution.
---
well, you can get super rare infusion from that event if you are lucky

I find it entertaining you believe there is a big difference between smashing your head into your keyboard using your skills on CD and spamming them randomly.
---
This is so adorable!
---
do you use butter or margarine with the Holo build?
---
FFXIV is "does the community want it? Then add it!"
---
Honest question - are we talking about something other than the crafting mats 'pile of putrid essence' etc? Because those are fully sellable on the tp...
---
Some of them are. Quality rapidly declined over time.
---
I knew a sylvari who loved cherries...
---
It's not, actually. There's been a lot of people multi-boxing meta events for years, same in WoW. I still see the same person with four or five identical characters covered in infusions that Mesmer pots their bots in to meta bosses at the last moment who has been doing it for years. I think the policy is as long as you are controlling them all and not using automated macros (i.e. one key=one action) it's fine.
---
Ah yes, paying to get into the game so you can pay to skip the game.
---
Go back to mobile please
---
It is sad indeed, i stopped playing as well mostly due on how cancer and unfun pvp was for a solid 1 year. Condi thief was just the ice on the cake. 
---
I strongly advice you to stop playing and try others games. Gw2 is only a gems-store casual cash cow nowadays, and it will keep going in that direction till it dies out.
---
Could have
---
What do you think those bioluminescent armors are made of ?
---
I wish the same for raids. Many bosses get trivialised by burning through phases so quickly that people split into dps phases and mechanic parts while avoiding many mechanics and interactions.
---
Gorse is a good example. He was an actual boss if you had to do atleast some of the mechanics and movement.
---
Sword 2 is fine and core of sword identity, it is even a cool skill. Abusrb poison stacking is not is just blant and stupid.
---
Multi box is allowed BUT multi box when in windowed mode with screen minimized is called AFK, and is ban offense. (That’s how guys tag all those meta with alt account and it is NOT what is allowed by multibox) 
---
You can idle (screen not minimized) but if you AFK you can be banned for multi boxing. Go on and ask the devs for yourself.
---
(So they can tell if you are playing the alt account or if it is auto attacking while minimized not by weather or not it is a visible screen and if it is not then you can be banned for it)
---
Also multi box doesn’t mean it’s legal to play idle so if you come to play PvP (and try to team up with your alt account to get free rewards) they will see it and ban your ass!
---
It’s happened multiple times to dumb ass pve multi boxer who think they can come play PvP and cheat for double rewards.
---
Anet knows and you can and will be banned for multibox if you use it in the wrong situations. (Like during tournaments or what not)
---
Last time I checked there were no buy orders at all, and the sell prices were lower than what you would get from selling to vendors
---
Thief  better no?
---
I'm curious! What is there that moves that an asura wouldn't try to dissect?
---
Instabilities should have been more radical, like "power damage halved, but condi damage doubled", and similar. So you have to bring different compositions to be effective.
---
Thank you
---
The dutch angle was very necessary.
---
[*sees skull cup*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK66wXW8kE)
---
Really?
---
IIRC you need to head back into the Sunspear Sanctuary and place the eggs and runes there to progress.
---
The Open Skies Achievement Collections do include the items you need and a description on where to get them so I would just check if you have completed all of them.
---
The only reason condi thief is working right now is because of sword 2 and daredevil dodge. The trait helps but it isn't making or breaking the build. Even the link OP did explain that's your entire damage rotation. You spam sword 2 and then dodge on them when they are immob. Immob gotta go from sword 2 and condi clean too, why the fuck does it condi clean??
---
What is this harbinger everyone keeps talking about in this thread?
---
then farm the gold, it is that easy you don´t have to play real world money.
---
While Cilantro Lime Sous-Vide Steak lasts 1h and BoSaSBSS lasts 30min, yes.
---
Cilantro Lime Sous-Vide Steak (lvl500) cost atm 42s to craft vs Bowl of sweet and spicy butternut squash soup(lvl400) cost 29s to craft , so no you don't "lose" gold
---
Alright stop right there. You are about to entet an infinite cycle of unproductive waste of bytes.
---
You're right. Didnt have that dye but it's a really good option for both channels
---
It's not that they are trying to make money, it's the way they are doing it.
---
Very fine people on both sides
---
"Recharging Teleport to Friend" ouch. It sounds odd but it already exists!
---
OR you just gem to gold and buy a permanent bank access
---
How this would work? Golem NPC would follow you around or exist as an item that spawns bank UI?
---
And sell recharging banker golem together for more $ for anet.
---
Destroy her ego squadW
---
I can, but considering I have a (finally) map completed character on EU, I figured its not worth it. Besides, playing on both is kind of fun.
---
And the ascended food is a feast so you can potentially feed your entire party.
---
Omg, this is super cute, please do more :D
---
Also you should link your art page of choice :3
---
3 years later and reaper wells still have no casting animation while wielding gs, get in line
---
Good old capitalism &lt;3
---
Noticed same too, there was no effect whatsoever at bounty run when boss hit many players nearby. Barrier didn't vanish as expected. Even few players got downed.
---
I don't see how this update makes it harder than what we already have. Gear only exists once across your characters. At least they've added an unequip all option
---
How do you get 60 statuettes without buying keys? I have like 7...
---
Not so annoying.  We have the option to unequip all gear. Beats manly doing it that we currently have
---
&gt; The story is longer form than that and dropping was considered, but the current head for the game stepped up in a BIG way and took over for the previous leadership. it was a huge undertaking, decent risk, and that risk was taken because of how important the brand itself was sure.
---
Just in case anyone's interested, [NoClip made an extensive documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs0yQKI7Yw4) about the FFXIV struggles.
---
Not quite. Needs more flying-through-the-air and hiding-in-bank-safes.
---
Then I would buy the game on the NA account due to the fact that you want to focus on sPvP and WvW. With the expansions you are more flexible and the new elite specs are mostly stronger compared to the core classes.
---
Is that supposed to be a charr cub? if so it is super adorable!

These are not "things", you long-headed buffoon. These consist of billions of tiny particles that hit each other violently and fall together in a unilateral direction, duh.
---
Don't forget to give her huge tits
---
Imagine not playing the game anymore yet bitching about it on reddit.
---
You should try doing daily runs with \[fast\] in dragonfall, just buy bounty harvesting tools if you do ( about half the profit comes from motes-&gt;magic-&gt;leather/trophies conversion and bounty tools give you 50% more motes harvested)
---
There is also an option to go for chained meta events in the world if youre into this.
---
I'll fall you in a unilateral direction you long eared rat :P
---
It looks super cute tho. Good work OP!
---
Tell that to the Grawl.
---
Metabattle has [an Open World builds page](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World), unlike most sites that are focused on Raids and Dungeons or PvP.
---
Oh no my heart. This is lovely, OP, thank you for sharing.
---
Well I hear Asia’s don’t have any internal organs and my natural curiosity about the world as a Sylvari May lead me to find out if it’s true.
---
unfortunatly this is incorrect. there is no save button and it will save after every change you make. this makes the trait and skills portion extremely useless. if you have it set up for one encounter and then change it for another you have to manually change it all back to get the original set up.
---
An example would be Chrono going from VG to Gorse and then to Sabatha:
---
VG would start with standard setup (with tank items if tanking). After the boss you switch to portal skills and stability traits for the Spirit Run events.
---
When you get to gorse you switch to a CC heavy standard set up with domination, paralysation sigils, CC skills.
---
After gorse its back to Portal setup to help speed up the Sabatha Pre. Then you switch to an offensive set up for sabatha who is a dps golem with a fire wall.
---
You can run 3 templates to cover these variations. However this is inefficent and costly. If you are part of a full clear group you will not only be having set ups needed to be ready for W1 but all 7 wings. taking the time to swap out templates and set up gear for the wing between wings is time consuming and frustrating. especially with anet's poorly optimised game and UI
---
At least be glad it's not a vivisection.
---
Go NA.
---
Aaaand I really regret not taking this over the scout's materials last night. I thought the price of this had dropped (and I already have it unlocked). Damn.
---
Take maybe 20-30mins to look at your damn rota at the golem, that isn't too hard nor time consuming. Your average pug group won't want a 95% benchmark or more lol + the DPS Meter stays.
---
Probably No.
---
I'm currently playing scrapper in pve as well because I havent unlocked holosmith yet. A lot of skills don't seem to do what theyre supposed to, and those that do arent really worth using in day to day pve.
---
I haven't had much trouble with them with a power reaper with dagger/dagger, as I just send the conditions back and there goes a cunk of their HP.   
---
Mirage are less troublesome too once you make them waste their evades.
---
The only ones I have been finding annoying are spellbreakers, holosmiths and firebrands, because of their incessant spammity spam and running around like headless chickens and away like cowards as soon as you turn the tables a bit on them.  
---
Their pace needs to be slowed down a tad.
---
No, actually, you are incorrect, as GW2 was promoted prior to launch as a one time purchase with free regular updates.
---
The fact that they brought in "expansions" and placed a price tag on them after millions of people already paid for the base game means they broke their initial promise and technically the law with false advertising.
---
Like I mentioned, if you enjoy giving your money to them, go ahead and donate your entire pension as well, because they are clearly working so hard to give the community what they want and need that they most definitely deserve all the extra money.
---
Plus electric windows and alloy wheels.

Hate to blow your mind but Guild Wars 2 is itself third party software relative to your operating system, so youre afraid to cross a bridge youve already crossed long ago.

---
if you like to PvP / don't like to mindlessly farm the same stuff over and over and over:
---
1. Go to sandswepped islands
---
2. Get ~~some~~ a lot of volaitle magic gathering tools
---
3. Queue for sPvP ranked (don't forget to choose a nice reward track for extra loot)
---
4. While you wait for the game to find ppl to play with: Gather every single node you can on this map with these volatile tools
---
5. Profit
---
Well, profit is made by...
---
* the rewards you get from playing sPvP
---
* the mats you gathered
---
* the volatile magic turned into mats (buy trophy crates)
---
Most likely you'll also farm the very mats you need to build your legendary, by doing this. Thus you bypass the 12% trading fee of the TP. Sell the mats you don't need, keep the ones you desire.
---
Someone once calculated, playing sPvP alone can net you around 8g to 10g an hour. It was calculated with 10 min to 12 min game + 3 min match making time in between. If you fill this 3min with gathering things in sandswepped, you get your revenue even higher. Also gather guild hall and home instance every day for even more $$$.
---
Thank you much
---
Seriously boosts are unnecessery, just play some wvw and you will get tons of tomes of knowledge, which you can use for fast leveling, or just level up some crafting professions.
---
There are tons of easy ways to level up fast if that's what you really want.
---
What's for sure is that Bloodstone has no culinary application.
---
So much this
---
I didn't use templates personally but sucks for those that did that they are now forced to use an inferior template system. I will protest by playing full berserker staff ele in the lab with trinkets on and bind fireball to F so every time I auto attack I can pay my respects to the arcdps template users. o7
---
1000 gems for an infinite bank access, which otherwise costs a fortune in gold.
---
You should apply for a game designer position at Anet.
---
Sounds like the legendary devaluing experience we get with the upcoming Lodouts. Just screw the guys who saved up for the bank access, right?
---
SUGOI MINA-SAN!
---
For a buy order, it's ~11 silver, which adds up considering how many of these I go through
---
Why is imgur suddenly making you sign in now.
---
Probably not.
---
But you get a lot of Level Tomes, Writs of Knowledge and other things that you can use to level up by just playing the game on a different character. You even get scrolls up to level 60 from birthdays.
---

---
Ohhhh wow that really makes it difficult as you say it happens never.
---
well at least you found a group to run with for something you seem to be enjoying a lot more than when you were with the old guild
---
I just didn't understand it as Tier 4. This is gonna be a challenge.
---
I couldn't find the wiki page for it. But thanks for the help.
---
"Screen shot"
---
10 bosses zzzzzz. Specific bosses or just random bounty bosses? Also, where would the chest be located? :)
---
Move on. Join the wvw guild from the discord. Friends come and go, u will gain new friends that u can wvw with instead.
---
Your old guild wasn't for you anymore. You have moved on.
---
Maybe you got kicked because of your lacking formatting skills
---
There are guilds out there which want you to represent the guild at all time. It is the right of the leader of the guild to decide like that. And if someone does not follow this rule and gets kicked, its completely fine. (I think thats stupid to do that but either i would not join such a guild :D) But still, he asked you to rep the guild, you did not follow the rules and you got the "punichment" for that. 
---
Still nothing to be mad of. This guild was clearly nothing for you so why are you even bother to make a post about it? You dont lose your friends because you are not in the guild any more. And obv. atm. you did not play at all with your guild.
---
My take as a "casual" gamer:
---
What aspects of these keep you coming back?
---
&gt; The fun **repeatability** of the fractals. Being able to develop your character without feeling like chasing a carrot. Some infusions are fine. Requiring full ascended and infusions feel like a chore.
---
&gt; **Bite-sized dungeon**s. Playing a dungeon crawler without committing to a full on dungeon experience.
---
What do you wish was different?
---
&gt; All fractals should aim to be a maximum of 15-20 minutes playtime for unorganized, inexperienced PUGs.
---
&gt; Less focus on ascended items and infusions. Rework infusions into Mastery system instead. Allows for casuals to be able to hit higher Tiers without equipment barrier for entry.
---
What could we have done better?
---
&gt; Condense pathing to be a bit more linear. 
---
&gt; What worked? See Snowblind, Uncategorized, Solid Ocean, Molten Boss (rework). Very easily navigated, straightforward, and directionally sensible.
---
&gt; What didn't work? Twilight Oasis, Urban Battleground. Paths are too chaotic, directionless, and too much running through trash mobs. Easily removable and condensable to make a more straightforward, enjoyable gaming experience.
---
&gt; Instabilities are not fun. Social awkwardness prior to rework is antithesis to the stacking nature of GW2 PVE.
---
&gt; Wind effects. Losing control of your character in a swirling fashion is not cool from a mobility or visual perspective.
---
What did we do well?
---
&gt; Puggability. Any class can perform well. While there are defined "metas", each class is honestly viable. All fractals should strive for this mentality. Players can multi-class on their professions and still feel rewarded while completely changing up their builds -- adds replayability.
---
find a new guild.. 100% rep is totally stupid since you see the chats of all the guilds you are in.
---
Great work! It’s really nice to see innovation in fractals - love the use of scheduled CC’s and team-play! :) looking forward to the next
---
What you said about introduction to fractals.... I dunno, I always felt there was a good introduction for new players to do fractals... If they start at T1. The game tells you about fractals when you reach lvl 80, and there is always a guildie that can guide new players, so I don't think there is a problem there. But dunno, have my guild for example that took some people, me and another newbie and started at T3, while we died a lot since even then other guildies hadn't had much experience.... Ugh it was painful. In a few next runs I had people kick voting me for not knowing the mechanics, obviously, I hadnt time to learn them. I am glad all is well now, but really, wish I had started from T1.
---
Different war. Also, humanity can't reclaim Ascalon if they wanted to. The logistics are impossible for them. :P
---
Yeah i know right! such an inconvenience even when you select remember me -.- they gotta sort that out.
---
I would prefer it to be more like the rechargeable tp yo friend.
---
use once, then needs an hour to recharge...I mean how often fo you need a bank per hour anyway?
---
Next time dont lock a collection cat(Simon) behind a CM item(essence). Some people are casuals and just want to collect the cat.
---
Lots of guilds have 100% represent rules for whatever reason. 
---
I’m in two guilds - one for WVW, one for PVE. The WVW guild requires 100% rep when in wvw, the other “all the time” but doesn’t do Wvw. I asked one of the guild officers of the PVE guild if the rep requirement could be waived for WVW and they said sure. Was pretty easy.
---
I understand it sucks, and I personally think it’s a silly requirement but it’s a pretty standard one.
---
Why didn’t you just switch your rep in WVW tho if your other guild cared about it so much? Unless you were completing a guild mission in WVW it doesn’t make any difference who you are repping.
---
It does really feel nice when everyone contributes, something that changed when the meta transitioned from the Chrono cc carry :)
---
I really think it doesn't matter anymore. They've been really silence since the backlash hit. Too many people defending the system or not caring. I think the target audience is too small to make a difference. Those that really need the system don't get treated too nicely by the community nor is it understood why they have a problem with it.
---
I had the same experience (sort of). First day in game I get to old lions arch and a couple people from this guild started showing me around, I joined em and fast forward 3 years and 5 server jumps later. Guild leader becomes super elitist, "only guardians, warriors, necros, and eles, in wvw" got the short end of the sick as I'm a engie main and played one for the entirety of my time with the guild (in wvw even). Guild leader has a melt down says to conform to one of them classes and a set build for said class or get kicked. Mass exodus of guild, we all scattered to the wind, we all hardly play anymore...thanks guild leader
---
I like that you picked him up for asura changing to Asia and then called Asia a content
---
Your not alone in your confusion.  I remember having to search for that POI online after 30ish minutes of searching the entire area.
---
Hey, after only a 6 year wait you now get to use Flesh Golem underwater.  You can't hog all the development time....
---
The same way you did before you found out about arcdps.
---
And you'd be tagging more as a Acro DD w/ Shortbow..
---
Leave your Engnieer in Istan where it belongs ^_^
---
Well, that depends on your definition of continent, of which there are several. The top of Wikipedia on "Asia" reads:
---
&gt; Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia
---
**Asia**
---
Asia ( (listen)) is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations.

I have to ask... what sort of network blocks a random site like dulfy? Also, wiki? It's a great site to find information and research sources.
---
My work network...
---
Sad to think how many people here have no idea what you said.
---
Even this site is blocked ? (Ayinmaiden has great and updated guides better than dulfy) 
---
[https://www.ayinmaiden.com/griffon](https://www.ayinmaiden.com/griffon)
---
Right, which should at least set some standard, but Anet think they can get away with this (and probably will) because there are just so many fanboys screeching "but they need to get paid"
---
well i think what drives most players mad now, is not the heavy enphasis on monetization, if not the lack of quality of their product, and what i mean by this is that when a game is good, fun and enjoyable, gets new content often, gets balance and qol upgrades everytime, etc, people are happy to pay, because they see how their game is improving every day
---
yet gw2 feels as it is in maintenance mode since the past 2 years, devs used our money to push new projects which weren't released, the content we are getting after pof is lame and mostly unfinished, quality of their product saw big downgrades, with unatended bugs, abusive mechanics and dumbed down combat, gimmicky events promoting players to spend cash to get more chances at rng, and yet no upgrade, or expansion or anything worth our money, they are trying to sell us nostalgia and half made game modes or events which are old events rebooted, the balance problems pof brought was never resolved, and every day the game feels and works worst, either lag, visual cluster, narrowed and boring meta surviving for 2 years, players leaving, new features introduced in a horrible way, and all of this unatended yet they focus their low man power only in skins and cosmetics to sell
---
maybe if they dedicated to improve the game, and fix most of the crap they added since pof release, people would be happier to pay, but beeing sold pure cosmetic crap or qol features that should have been here on release, just to see how the game gets dumbed down, and accumulates errors, bugs and no fixes on the horizon feels as a scam, add to that the lack of balance between classes, lack of new content except of a living story episode which you can complete in 2 hours, but takes 2 months to fabricate, same with raids they give us one every year, and we can finish them in 2 to 4 hours, also wvw and pvp beeing neglected because of the lack of devs who enjoy those game modes or understand how to balance them properly, and ofc players wouldn't be happy at all to keep paying for this scam, right now players have tons of demands and needs, none of them are related to cosmetic crap or monetized qol, yet thats all they will focus right now.
---
Hey, scepter should be very comparable. As you see the DHs didn't even use sword 3 on the boss (the buffs aren't even live atm). They used sword 3 on the 2nd add instead. They did not use it to chain fury either as fury is not a problem with multiple Feel My Wraths :)
---
When they add or change stuff, some things might get loaded a little bit differently into RAM. For example, they might add something to the player structure and now the address of variable that holds player's HP is at different offset within that structure. 
---
I only dipped my toes into programming and memory editing with something like Cheat Engine so can't give you more detailed answer on that topic.
---
Alright thanks for the answers, I picked my Lv 80 thief and prepared it. What runes should I put in my armor? Got the full set from "Nika". I decide between godlike or swiftness... Does it makes sense? And what accessories do I need? (back, rings etc...)
---
Depends on if you have your content guide pointing you to the PoI. If so, it will tell you "&lt;- Head this way to discover [PoI Name]". The only thing this won't give you helpful terms to /wiki are HPs and vistas.
---
Good watch, thanks for that.

If you do not have access to the wiki, you could try changing dns servers, to either googles:  [https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using)

or cloudflare:  [https://1.1.1.1/dns/](https://1.1.1.1/dns/). after setting any of those 2 you should have access to anything that is otherwise blocked on your network.

yes it does! it charges you lmao
---
Common misconception because of the ultra speed clears on here recently.
---
Longbow is only good for like 5 seconds where you have nice burst skills. The moment you start auto attacking, your dps is complete shit.
---
This means speed kills under 30 seconds or something godly only a handful of groups will achieve for like 2 bosses, longbow is an option.
---
Never bring longbow in fractals pls ty &lt;3
---
I had a similar experience. I swapped guilds to deposit something into my personal storage guild, insta whisper to rep. I was only repping the storage one for like 15 seconds total, so the officers seriously had some issues.
---
Left that guild instantly
---
I tried that last year and found int larger groups a lot of mobs where dead before you could get to them with the flame thrower.
---
Wat
---
What the fuuck. I really can't figure out why you can do this so much faster than me and my group.. Great job though, freikkin sick
---
the PSNA version is account bound anyway.

This makes absolute zero sense...
---
This website doesn't load for me
---
They were logged into Reddit on their phone but not the PC and they were too lazy to screenshot it properly and login on the PC to post it. So instead we get a photo of the screen posted via the phone.
---
This game is in maintenance mode.
---
In open world LB is great - its burst downtime is not a problem in most fights, the AA does enough damage to deal with trash and the range is just so comfortable to get participation and tags
---
Had that happened to me, all I did was swap to an alt for harvesting. Instant whisper, so I instantly left.
---
This makes absolute nero sense...
---
Multiple accounts to farm laurells and MCs
---
Pff. I already said I don't half-ass responses. You clearly weren't ready for someone to disagree with your interjected opinion, much less put thought into it, so no, YOU have a good day.
---
I remember that moment well.  Congratulations!
---
Wow, amazing kill.
---
That level of possessiveness should not be encouraged
---
Why would you even use elite before they used steal?
---
**What aspects of these keep you coming back?**  
---
 \- The challenge. The boss fight with interesting mechanics and  without boring fillers in between. The ability to buy and exclusive reward after doing it multiple times. The rewards with the feeling of accomplishment of a challenge mote.
---
**What do you wish was different?**  
---
 \- Some instabilities combination really kill the fun sometimes. Random instabilities are not really fun. Otherwise there is not much I don't like. 
---
**What could we have done better?**  
---
\- Add more exclusive rewards. Like the 100CM Celestial Infusion (Red) that can be bought on the NPC.

Adding more colors should be easy to implement and will give people incentive to keep playing them, those should not be able to be sold on trading post. Add the same exclusive reward system for 99 CM, like infusions, weapons skins, armor skins, transforms, or something, but make it look great, so people want to use them and showoff.
---
**What did we do well?**  
---
Chaos, Nightmare and Shattered Observatory "recipe". They are my personal favorite ones.  I mean, pretty much walking strait to boss fights with quick mid encounters, if they exist, that are not too much of a boring and meaningless chore. The boss with reactive mechanics like jumping shock waves, stack in a green, kill X or Y...

Gojira Mordremoth
---
It's irritating enough having selling guilds but at least we can use filters to remove 95% of them.  This guy has had this char in LFG 12+ hours per day for the last several weeks now.  
---
I assume this translates to "Looking for guild?"  This shit should not be in Raid LFG.
---
Aren't we all just billions of such tiny particles, though? Just going through life as all of these bits of ourselves hit each other and fall together as one?
---
I think they could come close to making something similar but their graphics would be muddled, not crisp like this, and the textures would be a lot lower resolution. I wish they could revamp the game's graphics to something like this though. It's the one thing I'd like to see the most from this game.
---
The correct form is *could have*, there is no such thing as *could of*, that's what OP meant.
---
That sucks but time to move on, continue to keep contact via flist/another guild with the friends you had in it. Because lets be honest "100% represent" is a fucking relic thing to do in this game and your better off not being in a guild when your GM's is that controlling.
---
Charr: Invade Ascalon, force King to ragequit and nuke his own city. Invade Orr and force them to ragequit and delete their entire fucking country, invade Kryta and force them to ally with evil in order to win.
---
Humans: 1000 year long war with a bunch of horses. Stalemate.
---
I don't think you understand what the term "hot take" means. This guy doesn't know what third party software is, or if he does was using the term out of context, so I informed him. 
---
Hot Takes, for *your* edification, are spur of the moment topical opinions offered with no forethought or due deliberation. I don't think what I said qualifies as that. Any other buzz words you need me to define for you?
---
If the guild say 100% rep then that is what you are signing up for. It might be a stupid thing they request but every guild have their own rules and if you are in the guild then those rules apply to you too. 
---
If you want to be in another guild and rep that then you talk to the owner of the guild, and it is up to the guild to decide if this is ok or not. If it is not then you will be kicked as you was in this case. 
---
Now i am not saying that those rules are good or bad, i have no opinion, but the rules are there so you knew about it and this is were i dont get why you post about it here on reddit. If there was no out spoken rules about it then i would understand you being upset but there was so then you have to choose. So just make the choice.
---
that doesn't answer my question - "this is ok, this is not ok" because ....reasons?
---
and as cherry on top "im a hypocrite though, i would do it as well"
---
you get 1 skill recharge to use freely, and it's fair for everyone. it's a layer of difficulty to interact with. take it away and you get raids (*pukes*)
---
Flashy female human meta says otherwise. perma blindness included. The time of heavy charr frontline in wvw and pvp all asura meta is long gone...
---
long live the zephyrite backpack charr frontline \o/
---
At 53 seconds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5b6uLsqIZ0there is a skin I like. Can this be purchased or is it a seasonal offer?
---
Can you share the necro build you are running? :)
---
A more decent way, or in other words the way where everyone else will buy stuff, but everything you want is free. How many times do we repeat this argument indeed? Once again. Bags, Storage Expanders, Bank Tabs, Character Slots, Crafting Licenses, Shared Inventory Slots... all in line with what they're doing with Build Templates. There is absolutely nothing new or different going on here. The only difference is a 3rd party stop gap is being disabled.  
---
QoL makes more money than cosmetics. Lets be real here. When you got legendary gear, there isn't a real reason to spend money to cover up the hard work you put into making that gear. Infinite tools, passes, wp unlocks, boosts, and anything that eases the burden of inventory control is the best way to make money. The cosmetics only debate is something that only works for non-sub games that aren't going to be around for more than 2 years.
---
Just so you know even if you are invisible you are not really invisible. Your dot will show on the map regardless. It is stupid because for me invisible is invisible but apparently this is not what the game think.
---
Is it really a stalemate if you're able to establish a foothold with a fortified capital city, several outposts, trade routes, and numerous outside communities?
---
The centaurs have their war camps, which can be quite impressive, but do they have anything else that suggests they're not just still there to fight?
---
"Could of" is not an expression there. It's "of course". You're saying "You could, of course, be wrong."
---
"Could have" is the correct verb phrase. "Could of" is a sentence fragment that doesn't mean anything on its own and only exists in the specific case where you put "could" before the phrase "of course". Stop trying to be pedantic if you don't even understand why your edge case works. 
---

---
Well, when Berserker got reworked and Arc Divider was deemed too strong, they hotfixed it. 
---
Berserker pre-patch didn't even have a metabattle listing and was rated 5 stars by a few people. Now Arc Divider has been nerfed and it is no longer a viable build according to the website.
---
I don't know why this extremely frustrating condi thief build should be treated any different.
---
This troll grammar shit was funny 20 years ago. Now you just sound like a 12 year old, cut it out.
---
They're pretty bipolar about it too.
---
why would you buy a level 80 boost when you literally drown in leveling tomes by just logging in and playing.
---
You're half right; it's a misspelling of "could've".
---
That's merely graphical, not the skills missing half their functions.
---
/r/lostredditors
---
this is your boss, get back to work /s
---
if it's blocked at work just look at the wiki at home then.
---
The best of both worlds. Get yelled at by enemy team for playing no skill cheese build. Get yelled at by your own team for playing sucky build.
---
He probably used [Burst Mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Burst_Mastery) instead of [Axe Mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Axe_Mastery)
---
Diversity.
---
First because it affects both new and vet players that have more choices to play.
---
Second is because perfect balance at all levels of play is impossible. 
---
There is no point to kill diversity for something impossible.
---
Wow, 100% rep guilds still alive? Whats their point? I can understand them before that rework, but now?
---
i like the way you think 😂
---
And my group wiped 2 times in normal mode!
---
These speedkills feel inhuman.
---
It's just mindless nonconstructive ranting.
---
Yes you deserved this.
---
Actually it's the mordrem shortbow! They have pretty similar glow effects though :3
---
Legit question but is flax farming still profitable? I moved my chars to rich nodes for my daily deldrimor crafting
---
A trophy from killing one of the dreaded mordrem snipers no doubt
---
Yeah, you deserve it. That was neither respectful nor constructive. In fact, this is one of the more justified forum warnings I've seen.
---
I think I figured out where you missed the mark. Jokes are suppose to be funny. That just came off as eh.
---
That is so cool!!
---
Noone deserves the pinishment of being part of official forums. This mod is cleansing you.
---
I at first didn’t notice the bots and was laughing at the guy named “The Unknown Beard.”
---
Wonderful job!
---
yes
---
Why dont you use a key for every mount? So it does not matter in which mode you are. Or Mount radical, seems quite popular for keylazy people.

&gt; # **10/15/2019—October 15 Release Notes**
---
&gt;
---
&gt;## **Living World**
---
&gt;### Halloween
---
&gt;Once again, the gates of the Mad Realm have opened, and Kryta&amp;#39;s most infamous monarch, Mad King Thorn, has returned to hold court in Lion&amp;#39;s Arch! Loyal vassals of the king are strongly encouraged to enjoy the festivities: meet the denizens of the Mad Realm in events across Kryta; tour the Mad Realm itself in the Mad King&amp;#39;s Labyrinth and the fearsome Mad King&amp;#39;s Clock Tower; compete with your fellow mortals in Lunatic Inquisition, Reaper&amp;#39;s Rumble, and the Mad King&amp;#39;s Raceway; attend to the king&amp;#39;s whims in his notorious pastime of Mad King Says; or match wits and blades against royalty in Ascent to Madness.
---
&gt;Willing adventurers are encouraged to meet with Magister Tassi of the Durmand Priory in Lion&amp;#39;s Arch for an exciting research opportunity. The Lunatic Court is also seeking to confirm disturbing rumors from Elona—adventurers who have met Palawa Joko face-to-face in the Living World Season 4 episode &amp;quot;Long Live the Lich&amp;quot; may debrief with Brigadier General Kernel in Lion&amp;#39;s Arch.
---
&gt;The Lion&amp;#39;s Arch Captain&amp;#39;s Council wishes to remind its populace that they are not affiliated with the Krytan monarchy and cannot guarantee the safety of any citizens who choose to dabble in dangerous realms, mad or otherwise.
---
&gt;- The Halloween Rituals (Annual) meta-achievement has been updated with a long-awaited new reward, the Pumpkin Crown! Earn your own crown by completing a variety of Halloween activities and showing your affection for the majestic Mad King Thorn. Last year&amp;#39;s meta reward, the Mini Haunted Candle, can now be purchased at Halloween vendors if you missed it.
---
&gt;- A new item has been added to streamline travel to Halloween activities: a reusable Invitation to the Mad Realm will be included in your festival mail. Just use it to be immediately whisked to the Mad King&amp;#39;s Labyrinth, or use it while in the Mad Realm to retreat to Tyria. If you misplace your invitation, you can purchase a replacement from Sarettokk in Lion&amp;#39;s Arch.
---
&gt;- Two new weapons have been released from the Mad King&amp;#39;s vaults: earn the Carapace of Chaos shield and Last Rites greatsword by completing new collection achievements. These achievements can be completed year-round.
---
&gt;- A new weapon set has arrived hot from the forges of the Mad Armory: the Royal Flame weapons are a fiery take on an antique Ascalonian design. Your choice of weapon is available as a rare drop from Trick-or-Treat Bags. As a show of benevolence toward his subjects, Mad King Thorn has also allowed a one-time guaranteed choice of weapon for those who open numerous Trick-or-Treat Bags during Halloween.
---
&gt;- The Mad King&amp;#39;s Raceway has been refurbished in the off-season and is now open! Two new races featuring the spry springer and nimble jackal have been added, and the returning Roll into Madness roller beetle track has been rebalanced with fewer gravestones, higher fences, and updated achievements, including a new achievement for completing the extreme challenge time! Show off your honed drifting to earn the new Ghostly Racing Scarf, or you can purchase one at a Halloween vendor—your trusty mounts will never know the difference.
---
&gt;- The mount race in the Mad King&amp;#39;s Labyrinth has been updated with new checkpoint visuals and its own adventure. Show off your best times, but mind the Labyrinth&amp;#39;s occupants!
---
&gt;- The Grand High Viscount of Candy Corn and Skeletal Lich have had their maximum health slightly reduced, and they now offer increased rewards when defeated.
---
&gt;- New weekly vendors have arrived in Lion&amp;#39;s Arch for the duration of the festival, trading limited supplies of rare goods for Candy Corn Cobs.
---

---
&gt;## **Mounts**

---
&gt;- Rune of Rage: Fixed a bug that caused the 4-piece bonus of the Major and Superior versions of this rune to grant fury and go on cooldown when leaving combat.
---
&gt;- Rune of Resistance: Fixed a bug that prevented elite skills that transform the player from  granting resistance.

&gt;## **Profession Skills**

---
&gt;- Gaze of Darkness: Fixed a bug that prevented this skill from inflicting vulnerability and blindness on visible enemies.

&gt;- Inspiring Reinforcement: Fixed a bug that caused this skill to have a range that was longer than intended. It will now correctly affect a range of up to 900. The targeting on this skill has also been lined up to better represent the area affected.
---
&gt;### Warrior
---
&gt;- Shrug It Off: Fixed a bug that prevented the version of &amp;quot;Shake It Off!&amp;quot; used by this trait from counting as a shout for the purposes of Vigorous Shouts.
---
&gt;- Vigorous Shouts: Fixed an issue that caused this trait to heal for less than the listed amount. Fixed an issue that caused this trait to have incorrect information in the combat log.
---

---
Welcome to the Guild Wars 2 subreddit! I can see by the age of your account that you came here just to whine.
---
Anet's position concerning 'salty sarcasm' is well documented here. You can't swing a cat without hitting several who have been warned about this type of criticism. So go ahead and reel the righteous indignation back in, man.
---
I for one am on the Anet side of this fight - don't come with bitching and complaints without some *useful* or *constructive* suggestion on improvements. No longer like the game? Find it 'literally unplayable'? Then move on. This ain't a workplace, there is no union.
---
I have played this game since launch, and have never *had* to pay dollars - other than initial game purchase/expacs - to be successful. Have I bought gems? Of course I have - for things I WANTED, not needed. Can you recognize the difference? I may be in the minority here, but I feel like Anet/GW2 have the closest-to-perfect pay system there is. No monthly sub fee, and no reduced or truncated experience for those who don't buy gems or BL keys.
---
Take your salt somewhere else.
---
so right after having her on the panel for the Icebrood Saga she‘s also gone lol
---
Love how you both used the 2 different horns
---
&gt;  - An additional selection of dye kits has been added.
---
&gt;  - The exclusive Grasping Phantom Glider, Mini Spooky Mounts Pack, and Envoy Scythe Staff skin are currently available.
---
&gt;  - Additional items including the Toxic Mantle and Toxic Gloves skins, Soul River Glider, Phoenix Glider, and Bubble Glider, and a selection of travel toys have been added.
---
&gt;### Improvements and Updates
---
&gt;- For a limited time, miniatures from the Scary category are available for 1 Black Lion Miniature Claim Ticket each.
---
&gt;- Additonal containers can now be previewed in the Gem Store.
---
Hopefully you're banned from reddit too for trying to stir up drama

CTD in LA....guess I'll wait for hotfix :/
---
Have you heard of Jagex?
---
Out of interest, what was shown?
---
No problem.
---
&gt; Can I see them coming and dodge when solo? Yes (...and then die because I don't usually manage to kill the four elite anomalies in time)
---
And this is actually the best way to learn their attacks, even if you don't manage to kill the last one

''The only advantage this recipe still holds is flexibility. If you only need 30 minutes or less worth of buff then part of the ascended food's 1 hour duration is being wasted.''

For those saying the Joko thing is new this year I just checked the Halloween Patch notes from last year and it was added then "Willing adventurers are encouraged to meet with Magister Tassi of the Durmand Priory in Lion's Arch for an exciting research opportunity.

---
I needed a lot for my guild hall, can't compare prices for you, sorry.
---
Was just about to say that :D All jagex devs leaving suspiciously fast
---
You call "We will make a prologue, episode 1, episode 2 and a pvp armor set" a roadmap? We already knew about build templates, swiss and alliances.
---
You see this in every mmo there is, pushing hybrid classes then reworking them and reworking them and reworking them...
---
Allmost like Mesmer (Chronomancer) too.
---
Just focus once, and don't fuck around with different concepts that all lead to nothing.
---
Would be fun if Engineer would be more viable in PvE alltogether.
---
Have you read that patch that said :
---
- fixed a bug.
---
N literally that was all bro
---
Huehuehuehue! *eats popcorn* nomnomnom
---
One is software that you pay for from a reputable company, that exists and functions on its own, that comes with its own installer and pushes updates automatically.
---
The other is free software that comes from some guy on the internet, that only functions as an add-on to another piece of software that youve already downloaded, that needs to be downloaded and saved in the correct directory to function, and whenever it's updated (generally when the software it depends on is updated) you need to manually re-download it to make it work again.
---
You don't see meaningful differences between those two that might make someone leery to try the second type of software, but fine with the first?
---
Come now. Oversimplifying things so that you can justify a pedantic comment is even worse than the original pedantry. You don't need to keep digging this hole.
---
All of it should be treated the same. Its not like having multiple tabs for each currency is hard. Sure, candy corn is the most common but that isn't a reason to ignore the other mats.
---
Seems like theres still no sink for the useless halloween items where millions are stuck in the TP.
---
there are Halloween pvp events though...
---
Who is left?
---
Pretty sure the dev is. Asking regarding the CM's in general due to. The other post.
---
You sweet summer child you, that isn't a roadmap.
---
If you mean the live stream, that provided only vague infos without any date. We have had lots of stuff promised being delivered even years after.
---
A roadmap has objectives, and we don't even know if we will have episode 1 by the end of the year or if raid team is still a thing.
---
Everything is FINNNEEEE
---
yea when i took of my represent the leader immediatly told me : u forgot to turn on the represent on this character
---
&gt; New races
---
For new people: he means mount race events.  
---
For the few veterans that are left: you know damn well that you won't get new character races.
---
"Alrighty, PvP season ended today, now is the time to pass a balance patch to get as much data as possible before the next season in 3 weeks......." 
---
 
---
Ah, of course, that seemed to logical for Anet. Guess **IF** we are even getting a balance patch at all in the next 3 months, they would probably throw it in the middle of the season, or better yet, a couple of weeks before the end to make the already volatile matchmaking some more.
---
Meanwhile, condi thieves, holos, condi mirages and spellbreakers, DE unhealthy playstyle continue to drive away the few people who dare try PvP, as well as wear down the veterans.
---
rant? where? it was a sarcastic comment, i was laughing while posting it
---
 **What aspects of these keep you coming back?** 
---
Nightmare - quick boss succession, bullet hell, short fractal, nice rewards
---
Observatory - interesting bosses, short fractal, nice rewards
---
 **What do you wish was different?** 
---
Optional difficult(er) challenges for added rewards
---
 **What could we have done better?** 
---
more rewards for KPs, like the infusion and tonic, some people have &gt; 4 stacks of KPs at this point and they're just selling them away, add KPs to 99cm as well, more exclusive rewards for CMs, make other fractal CMs as challenging as 100/99
---
 **What did we do well?** 
---
(somewhat) challenging content, good enough rewards for people to go replay this every day (that's where most of the replayability comes from), some interesting fights (arkk, last boss of 99, MAMA)
---
This is all, of course, my opinion.
---
Yes
---
what he said wasn't a lie. and let's face it everyone! 
---
THE TRUTH HURTS. :)
---
Only heard some stuff, but can you explain more clearly what's about that?
---
That.....really wasn't a roadmap.
---
I approve your sylvari and your name
---
r/outofcontext
---
lol, and i am the salty one, my gawd ppl won't get a joke, sorry for beeing so offensive lmao
---
so balth gloves, neat!
---
Or... they could release a round menu type selection, ban the mount radial menu and change gems for each mount slice ;)
---
Wait, how are leggies being devalued?
---
Yeah that happened to me too it's really horrific
---
To cut it short, multiple people have 'left' recently, but we're uncertain if that is true. The developers are simply suggesting it is a 'coincidence' but I believe otherwise.
---
This was the first thing I noticed after I got the skyscale when it first came out lol. Anytime I do Jade Maw all I can see is upside-down skyscales underground now.
---
"Hey guys the game is slowly dieing of old age. Still tho don't quit and buy gems". Seriously what do you want? Because this is what would happen. They lie and say everything is OK then you make a post a month later saying what a bunch of lieing scumbags. Or they tell you the truth and you make a post asap being angry at them for even allowing such a state of the game and then quit yourself. Or 3, the mosy reasonable, they stay quiet.  Wait for the doomsayers to calm down for the 73rd timè and release updates as planned.
---
As a guild they were only doing raids and i was bannerslave every wednesday and thursday since the moment i started raiding
---
No new Themed Launcher and Character Selection Screen u\_u
---
Many leave, but many opportunities open! Veterans leave to make space for junior employees. Gears of progress.
---
Tom Abernathy is still on board as the Director, there is Novera King too...
---
what is the size of the patch?
---
It's okay, I can outrun a centaur...
---
Novera King.
---
Now, if she leaves the narrative team, then we really should panic.
---
It really feels like Anet slowly bleeding to death. I know it's not all doom and gloom but how should anyone be assured that the company isn't going down. Well-known devs are leaving en masse all of a sudden and anet hasn'T announced anything big since pof.
---
&gt; A system provided by third party software getting replaced by an ingame one that only really hurts the small amount of big powerusers
---
Please see:
---
&gt;They've never experienced it, so they just don't know
---
You labeled it as adult content
---
What roadmap LOL
---
Is it a joke?  Sounds like you're a passive aggressive asshole.  Why are you so salty that you posted something non constructive and it got removed?
---
I've heard that ppl liked OSRS but not the regular one. Maybe it's related to that? It kinda mirrors WoW Classic's situation.
---
she's worked in Arenanet since October 2018.
---
Mad king mounts and Halloween appearance package must be new?
---
i told him that i only represent the wvw guild for 2 hours a week and he said either change the rep or leave the guild
---
" Skeletal Wings Backpack  " We are Devil May Cry 5 now
---
Nah, they're old. I'll mark the new items in a min.
---
love how every negative comment related to this game gets tagged as "whinning" or "crying" even if it's just a joke, meanwhile the quality of the end product keeps getting worst every day
---
About 287 MB
---
Very sharp and pointy. Not suitable for kids.
---
You were a dick and got treated like one.
---
Yes, but people don't seem to understand it. It was clear to me. Use math skills!
---
Prologue -&gt; EP1 -&gt; EP2 -&gt; EP3 -&gt; EP(previous number)+1 to infinity.
---
people like OSRS but not the regular one because they turned RS3 into a situation where getting a real job and paying for levels is 50 times more efficient than leveling with content.
---
Honest answer: yes.
---
This forest is on fireeeeee
---
.....why would there be???? this is just the halloween update.
---
I'd not be surprised, I guess it was super stressful for every dev making the announcement, especially Novera and Julia. 
---
And especially Julia, that actually cared a lot about the community and GW2's story - got a massive kick in her butt.
---
Well, both senior members from both OSRS and RS3 have left. It is both parts.
---
Almost everyone in my guild has played since release, so I dont know why you say there are few left lol
---
Job done = Leave company
---
Or 1 year contract. Second year another employee. Third year another employee... etc. Diversity and new ideas!
---
Oh you're right, my bad. Here's gemstore banner image or whatever for it: https://services.staticwars.com/gw2/img/content/42245d46_splash.jpg
---
I agree with everything you just wrote. He spoke the truth about some aspects of the game. And yeah, those truths do suck. They suck so hard for some people that they find another source of entertainment. They suck so hard for some that they write their own API apps to add utility to the game - looking at you, creator of GW2Efficiency! Cheers!
---
But if OP had just browsed the sub, or the forum, he would have been wise to Anet's policy, warned about the warning, and maybe would have decided *not* to post the content that got him banned. A little reading goes a long way.
---
I like how they incorporate extra life into the game through rewards.
---
&gt;And especially Julia, that actually **cared a lot about the community and GW2's story** - got a massive kick in her butt.
---
As opposed to Bobby Stein who have been there for OVER 10 YEARS, who supposedly don't care at all? I am quite sure that most if not all of the employees care deeply for the game and their respective areas of it.
---
You also seem to know more than the rest of us. Where was it said that she got fired? Based on the tweet it seems like she simply left to work at another company instead?
---
The people who want a roadmap aren't looking for assurance that living story will continue.
---
While we're talking about roadmaps, let me show you how one should look like:
---
https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/assets/uploads/2019/09/Destiny-2-shadowkeep-season-of-the-undying-roadmap.png
---
This is from the aforementioned Destiny 2's current season - this includes dates for every event detailed in it.
---
The fact that she seems to leave around exactly a year after she got hired could suggest that it was just a timed contract though.
---
That dot is ridiculously inconsistent but fortunately I have no use to care about it most of the time.
---
Oh, I thought he was just being sarcastic
---
And when you return to PvE, you'll have the warclaw selected next to your skill bar.
---
Indeed, and surely a year is a rather standard time period for a timed contract? So there is that.
---
nah friend, don't turn this on me, everyone who said "yes you do" i didn't even reply, i answered you because its funny you call me salty yet you keep insulting me, like if you were co owner of anet or a team leader in a dev team xD
---
again i am not the salty one "are you unable to read?" and if i was salty i wouldn't release my grudge against you pal, no need to insult you at all
---
also i got jailed so i can't post on official forums until tomorrow, and my post was banned so it's almost the same...
---
"hey man im gonna spit out trash out of my mouth with no reason"
---
"lol oh my gawd people these days dont get jokes dafuq"
---
Thats the resumen of your posts and comments there, just analyze...
---
what you want is irrelevant. they said what will come and on what they are working on. thats a fucking roadmap.
---
Especially if you've seen some the slightly insane looking messages from such people
---
Wow there's only 1 guy on the lore team who's been there longer than 2016? That's a bit worrying especially when it comes to tackling plot threads from as far back as GW1.
---
The invitations sound like a good use for a shared inventory slot. 
---
A cat combat tonic? That should be interesting...
---
Damn, she's HOT
---
the wind can blow in funny ways. my wvw guild kinda sunsetted itself by people stopping to play faster than we can get new recruits. bad leaders can ruin it fast, but leading is also really stressful. I think I prefer not leading and not having to worry anymore, I'm in a casual generalists guild and I find myself playing a lot more lately.
---
Spoken like a true sylvari.
---
ok nice resume, only thing i'd change is the "spit out trash" part, actually i belive i said the truth about the  regrettable state of our beloved game
---
you uninformed gw2 player. they also gave interviews, that were all linked here, with what is to be expect in the future. aka a roadmap.
---
I loved your comeback hahaha ur my hero
---
&gt; why you say there are few left
---
"Raiders are unhappy so the game is dead!!11"
---
For a contract position? Sure. But for someone on a narrative team? I consider 1 year to be pretty average for someone who hasn't yet settled into their career. It's hardly longevity. I know that game devs rotate around a lot but 1 year is pretty short.
---
I knew he didn't mean character races, but it got my hopes up for a second nonetheless.
---
nah, i'm more interested on making fanboys look at the real state of the product they are buying every day as customers, and how the lack of  criticism is not helping at all, also how anet forum managers just tend to censure everything they don't like yet they don't give any kind of reply to the ones who actually post constructive and polite shit
---
A student in the Lord Hizen school of sarcasm, I see
---
anet has stopped giving release dates for over 5 years now.
---
I think it will be the same. Each donation mark Anet hit in the 24hour stream items will be unlocked for us. I doubt theres and event ingame that lasts for just 24hours.
---
Don't do this to me....
---
Holy shit the Mad King Mounts
---
No skins for skyscale/petey/warclaw though? :(
---
maybe not a polite one, but i think the message is clear
---
"anet can you please stop monetizing crap that should have been on the game since release date, and start to fix all the crap you keep ignoring for the past 2 years that's ruining our game experience?"
---
thats better? guess what i wouln't be banned about a post like that but i would be ignored as everyone else, at least with this i made them read what i had to say
---
so pumped for the dungeon! haha sure wish gw2 had those haha
---
I'd hope so, but for few months, more positions are being added, rather than filled.  [https://imgur.com/a/kfLToeF](https://imgur.com/a/kfLToeF)
---
&gt; Extra Life Donation Bundle
---
and

&gt; 	Donations collected (USD): $_
---
would almost imply that tehre will be a gemstore item
---
I’m so bad at cooking, I burn my salad!
---
I know it doesn't fit the game at all, but that's one adorable pig!
---
Not the best quality but just recorded this quickly for my guild, figured i'd post it to Reddit in case anyone else can't log in.
---
[Relevant.](https://youtu.be/ARJaouGmyhI)
---
a little reading made me understand it doesn't matter what you post, they will either ban it or ignore it, if you post sarcastic and "mean" stuff at least they take the work to read it once
---
That's harsh. You're better off in another guild
---
We don't know every member of Anet and it's especially rare to know when someone joins. There wasn't a thread when this person joined.
---
And how do you know it wasn't a contract position?
---
It's not just raiders that have quit the game lol. Loads of people have quit in every sub-community.
---
Anet is trying to replace the charr!
---
This is just the first step!
---
BEWARE.
---
&gt;That's a good point, but you're still missing something, it was that they hired temporary staff to make expansions. 
---
Uhh, no they didn't? PoF was made by the remainder of the studio over the period of LS3, with 3 teams assigned to develop episodes 1/4 2/5 3/6, presumably with teams reassigned as appropriate when their second episode was completed.
---
&gt;The problem wasn't that they had a skeleton crew, the problem is that they refuse to invest in an expansion.
---
Yes, the problem *was* that they had a skeleton crew, in the duration that ArenaNet was working on the now-cancelled side projects, the studio grew to a significant extent. IIRC ~450 was the stated figure.
---
For reference, that headcount is bigger than Valve (~350). Now consider the number of projects Valve has in active development. Funding wasn't an issue.
---
&gt;It costs money to make it, and they just refuse to outlay it or take the risk and ask for the loan.
---
The problem wasn't this money narrative you're hung up on, it was that Mike O'Brien was determined to break ArenaNet away from the Guild Wars franchise. GW2 was assigned a skeleton team to keep the game active at least until one or more of the side projects reached completion.
---
Remember the ending of LS4? Even LS5 was an uncertainty, because the plan was to move on ASAP. Since NCSoft pulled the plug on the side-projects, cementing ArenaNet's existence as the sole "developer of guild wars", the studio was no longer capable of offering that which O'Brien wanted, so he left.
---
So again, if you want to point fingers and blame someone as a GW2 fan, blame Mike O'Brien. Not ArenaNet.
---
But plant type is weak against fire, I know Pokemon
---
Well, I don't. But my preference would not be to put one of my rookie contractors up on stage to represent my company's upcoming product.
---
partnerlook is kinda cringe in my opinion idk
---
they're not 'leaving en masse'. Big companies have a shifting workforce all the time, the only time you notice that is when it's well known people leaving.
---
Royal Flame weapons are just recolored, flaming Ascalonian Catacombs weapons, sad to see something like that among super rare drops along with thousand gold infusions.
---
I'm not going to try explaining what a criticism is.   
---
&gt; guess what i wouln't be banned about a post like that but i would be ignored as everyone else 
---
Well your efforts still resulted in the same.
---
Oh noesss
---
That's really not a long time. I was not the slightest bit miffed by O'Brien leaving - I have been expecting it since 2017 - but I thought Julia was here to stay for another couple of years.
---
XD ok let's forget it, gw2 is in a great state, the game flows awesome and everything works fine, in fact you guys got to me, ill go and buy some gems, maybe that stupid charr chair hahaha, all to support this wonderful company which used our money in tons of side projects they kept hidden, yet not even one released
---
idk what i was thinking with all my crying and whining, as a customer i don't deserve to complain in any way rather than buying more gems, maybe one day they sell the ability to criticize them without bans
---
That does kinda look like Mads Mikkelsen. Great job.
---
It's the griffon.
---
Everything will be okay, guys! Let's be happy for her for her big step up to Bungie!
---
i really missed the "i should be hired by now, i know" xD
---
oh my god, yes! This has bugged me since Pof Launch
---
I'll wait for my giant flaming meteor mount, thankyouverymuch.
---
Donations collect will likely be a bar in game that fills up every donation made if you read " Update in: \_ " and "Travel to Lion's Arch to see donation updates and claim your Extra Life Bonus effects." this suggest that it'll be the same as last year. Maybe the bundle will be for people who want to get all the stuff after the event happens.
---
Being 'very sensitive' and doing *anything* in the world of game development/marketing/etc are core-level incompatible.
---
You should re-read the comments. No one is disputing Asia being a continent.... No one called it one either though. ;)
---
&gt; For the few veterans that are left: you know damn well that you won't get new character races.
---
I can still hope.
---
No, that's not. Saying, there will be future episodes, is not a roadmap. A roadmap is a clear outline of coming features and content.
---
Partnerlook?
---
But they don't face massive layoffs and projects cancellation all the time so it is to be expected that all that shifting workforce on top of it looks gloomy.
---
Yea, or greatsword Mirage with Sigil of Stamina.
---
Yeah I'm sure the Charr settled Ascalon at the time of the big bang or sooner. /s
---
&gt; Well-known devs are leaving en masse all of a sudden and anet hasn'T announced anything big since pof.
---
They are leaving at the rate anyone leaves a company. This is the reality of work in 2019 - people rarely work at the same place for more than a few years.
---
We know exactly what's coming and there is plenty of big stuff - the prologue was as big as a regular episode, there is an entire saga of that to come. The biggest update in the history of WvW is in the near future and just two weeks from now fucking build templates are finally coming out.
---
Y'all can pretend the sky is falling but you just look stupid. GW2 is doing fine right now and there is plenty to look forward to.
---
people seem to not understand that people are constantly leaving from companies to do something else
---
finally the catmander tag can be used as a combat cat.  sorry charr, a new cat will be taking over the battlefield now.
---
Yup, the balance for those has been off for quite a long time. When was the last time a halloween 20 slots bag was cheaper than crafting a normal 20 slots bag ? Especially now with 24+ slot bags that use normal 20 slots in their recipes when you wanna upgrade, the halloween ones need to be actually cheaper to be worth it (8g max). That should be the metric to balance the candy corn economy.
---
Pretty sure we always got 1 per year.
---
Lol right 👍🏻
---
Can I get a TL:DR of your TL:DR?
---
Aaaaa that charr cub is ADORABLEE
---
It's only a matter of time. They long ago threw out any artistic vision for this game in favor of simps and their love for ever increasingly shiny things and their money.
---
How does one obtain the fiery skins?
---
Happy Halloween indeed!
---
That's normal. It's called churn.
---
Can anybody please make a gallery of the mounts for us at work? Thanks
---
Thanks!
---
You're kindling themed sylvari.*
---
;)
---
While that all might be true, it also makes it feel like something has changed and people are leaving because they don't want to work there. The few people here and there are understandable because people want to do new things or expand themselves, but when it is one after another what are people supposed to think with no communication?
---
thank you!
---
She wants to be a mesmer like her Sire.
---
Yep, always get it on your first look of the year.
---
This game is slowly crumbling away, torn apart by repetitive, excessive micro transactions. Ashes of creations is out soon, archeage unchained is out today. Time to sign off I think.
---
Does the Cat's Eye amulet do anything special?
---
QvQ aww dude, yer makin me blush
---
It's hard to make friends in this game. Being a part of a "team" makes it easier to play with friends and care about the game in general.
---
I mean, you're welcome?
---
Looks gloomy, yes. But if it's just part of the natural cycle then it isn't actually a reason to be gloomy.
---
An orthopedic surgeon may be required due to how big Charr get.
---
The only gear that looks terrible is the one that is obtainable in-game.
---
Please do not do the devils lettuce with a baby around
---
are they the same as new black lion ticket? D:
---
Anet shoud incentivize building Friendships, because that is what actually keeps players online. 
---
Op's proposed way of doing so is by tweaking WvW in specific ways.
---
yea an ex-guildmate told me that he is paranoid with represent.
---
But that's my point: Rewards don't just have to be skins, it can be the fun of working with other players. I don't believe that the people who do fractal CM dailies or weekly raid clears are doing them for any of the "rewards" that the game gives, but rather to play with friends. My proposition is that WvW be made challenging and fun. I think people want to play WvW, but can't because of the bad balancing, and this needs to be changed.
---
My only question is... why the fuck did it take this long
---
They fixed the amount of healing from Vigorous Shouts? Oh boy, Hitman will be so happy!!!!
---
Negative. All infusions in the ToT bags were there last year.
---
mail me your gold
---
Good.
---
Comedy gold dude haha gottem
---
&gt; People play MMOs to play with other people,
---
Here's where's you're wrong, kiddo ^^^about ^^^GW2.
---
Don't shatter my Tengu dream!
---
Firebrand, Daredevil, and Scrapper are considered the top three.
---
Impossible. Skimmers didn't go faster on water at PoF launch. I think that was added for A Bug in the System.
---
That works too.
---
You mean the thing where WoW Classic isn't as popular as BfA? Way more people play BfA than Classic. There are more mainline servers, there are more mainline players, it's absurd to think Classic was ever going to compete with the juggernaut that is mainline WoW.
---
Eucalyptus?
---
I think you’ll find they did. But they went even faster after a patch some time afterwards
---
Yep, this is good news. Shadowkeep was great but shorter because of their new planned story release, and since she has experience with how gw has done it, I'm quite excited.
---
Ugly Wool clothes got removed. Only left as legacy.
---
There are candy canes though.
---
D R A G O N
---
It's kind of weird to see people react calmly to Mike O leaving but get all sad and doom and gloom over this.
---
She's a young narrative professional who benefits from having more titles under her belt. She likely nearly a year working on the Icebrood Saga, and now that what's mostly left is for that the ship over the coming year or so, she wont have another opportunity to have her name on another narrative title in a while if she stayed with ArenaNet.
---
Great now destiny 2 will get a bunch of  irritating cutsey characters like that asura chick with the annoying high pitched unfunny voice.
---
WvW Exists?
---
&gt; Where are the expansion-worthy features that were promised coming with LS5 in lieue of an expansion? I don't call a shrine prompt expansion-worthy.
---
Cooking 500 is "epansion feature" according to anet.
---
You are aware that a natural cycle has death at its end, right?
---
You can argue that the decline is part of the cycle but that just emphasizes how gloomy things are.
---
There was a new cat necklace datamined that says "become like a cat" , nothing within its slot when previewed but they name suggests grey.
---
it is about the rarity rating
---
&gt;  Is this game anything like WoW? 
---
It's nothing like WoW in terms of being a traditional MMO. No quest hunting, no gear score, no sub, and combat is better IMO.
---
&gt;  What's the endgame like 
---
From what I've been hearing from WoW players, their raids are more challenging that GW2's. That being said, because there's no gear score, you can pretty start raiding whenever you want. In fact, if you have friends who're willing to fund your gear and carry you through the leveling process, you can start raiding on Day 1 if you really wanted to, though that's not advisable because you'd need to learn the intricacies of the game and its core mechanics. 
---
You'd need to buy the expansions to experience raids, but if you're set on being F2P, there's Fractals of the Mists which are basically dungeons 2.0. Anet has been clear that they're not going to work on the original dungeons, so fractals are basically the game's "official" dungeons.
---
You can expect LS-locked mounts to be waaaay low on the priority list for updates, especially now that LS4 is over
---
They look like they should be from wing 5 and not in the gemstore
---
Aww dang, didn't see your comment. :')
---
Nice screenshot, we really should get more 'dynamic duo' fashion posts here
---
That being said, we also have an oversaturation of fire themed looks, so I can't say that the looks are particularly unique by themselves
---
Yep. Changing the fundamentals of the game mode hasn't worked. Different people just want different things out of the game mode and you can't make everyone happy.
---
Right now they're trying to improve it by continuing to work on alliances and focusing more on balance. Both of those are sort of slow processes. They can't throw resources at balance and have it be that much better than it is now.
---
Lol, so true.
---
I mean lot of people already stopped playing who were your friends so it’s not really bad. 
---
My only beef is with 100% rep in gw2. I would understand 100% rep if your only allowed 1 guild in game. But you have 5 slots which is impossible to 100% rep 5 guilds. 
---
I unintentionally joined 1 when I first started gw2. I wasn’t playing with anyone and I get a whisper to rep. It was really annoying. First, It was second day with them so idgaf about them. Second, it was like a nagging gf when she’s in your grill thinking you cheated on her and all you are doing is going shopping for Cheetos. 
---
Anyways, you have a new guild that your are having fun with. Wvw is a game mode that is keeping you in game, and that is good. If a guild is making gw2 stressful to play in, then you shouldn’t be in that guild. Playing a game suppose to be fun and always should be. Hopefully your friends you got kicked from will still play with you. If not then they weren’t really your friends. Best of luck and new beginnings to your wvw guild. Most likely someone will talk to you from your old guild.
---
The GW2 community used to be a lot better. There are a lot of bitter, angry hangers on who haunt this sub and the community like miserable ghosts, trying to drag everyone down and shit all over anything that happens.
---
There was a time when the community wasn't dominated by a vocal minority of miserable people.
---
Thank you!
---
Something something free to play mobile game.
---
I don't agree, it is possible to have a lot of variety in themes even with a low budget.
---
Thank you for all the responses!
---
Great piece of art! Reminds me of Jhin from League of Legends
---
Assuming permanent 5x Invigorated Bulwark isn't realistic but yeah.
---
Eehhhm nope. The principle of a natural cycle is that it doesn't end, otherwise it's not a cycle. You might wanna reread your high school biology books.
---
I'm arguing that there is no actual decline, just a normal pattern of people leaving and people joining. 
---
Don't get me wrong, the lay offs were definitely a big hit for the company, but that doesn't mean that some other people leaving is a definitive sign of things getting even worse.
---
What do these bots do? Kill monsters or transferring stuff between bank and the tp?
---
I definitely understand the history. I guess my post is more meta and along the lines of "why did Anet decide to do these things, and why haven't they realised that fixing WvW is a sure-fire way to reinvigorate the game?"
---
Where do you actually find girls that like games IRL XD
---
Yeah, it's kind of like nine women can't deliver a baby in one month. Sometimes shit just takes time. Like reworking basically the entire infrastructure of your WvW code for alliances, IIRC.
---
Why should we care if your going to leave just leave.
---
You're always allowed to ask for help. That's what gw's community is for. (&gt;n\_n)&gt;
---
I haven't paid for any content in over two years now, they keep updating the game.
---
Alliances are a solution to the wrong problem. As a developer, you can't have week-long matches with optional participation and also balance.
---
Balance is less important than fun. Fun should have been their priority.
---
Why not?
---
  "They're slow-cooking the alliance system "
---
so.. young... so.... naive.....
---
jokes aside i really belive they are now talking about alliances because of the fiasco that announcment was, and all the backlash they got from pvp/wvw community that same day
---
but i really belive they weren't working on it and if they are now they just started and it will take them more time to finish that than to close the game or officialy put it in maintenance mode (which already is thats why i added "officialy)
---
Or, "Our employees keep getting amazing job offers from these AAA companies that they can't sanely refuse. Guess we have to find someone to replace them"
---
Or, get this, wait for it, a whole new level of legendary surprise.......buy the dmn perma bank access and stop whining.
---
so.... when does the fucking event end? am i blind? not seeing it plainly stated?
---
It's not dye-able anyway.
---

You two are lookin hot.

That’s probably why she took the job at Destiny 2. It’ll be a huge boost to her resume if she can come in and give Destiny 2 a narrative worth remembering.
---
Price already plummeted as we are speaking. 
---
Still thought it was worth to share as you don't need to buy more than one.
---
so people have more options and can decide which is best for them?
---
the real question is why do you post such a dumb question?
---
You shouldn't care.The game is dying. Isnt that obvious to the community? Losing dev's, shit new content. It's done, mtx has increased ten fold since last xpac. Just another money grab.
---
Wait, did Zealot's Defense get buffed again? It was buffed 20% last patch too. Was it not working last time and they fixed it for this patch?
---
Exactly!! I used to be in a "country guild" that had the saaameee rule. Even after the Influence system changed. I said this exactly thing to the officers and they response was: "yeah we know but.. just change rep in 20 minutes pls..". I left for good. And I think, Dr Mounaras you would be even better without them.
---
Not even Bethesda shits on community and disallows mods that fix and improve their own flawed game. F for arcdps, S for ANet.
---
Mad King Thorn has been part of the Guild Wars universe for 14 years now.  It's nice and all that you're longing for the old, pure days of Guild Wars back in 2004, but I would hope that you've accepted that their artistic vision for the game has included flaming pumpkin heads for a long time now.
---
Those kinds of comments used to impact me a lot because of the authority of the writing style and the line of logic they follow. Unfortunately, once you have experience under your belt, you realize that they're just blowing smoke out their ass. "High turnover is bad" is quite the statement and is both true and untrue, depending tremendously on context. Context matters enormously.
---
It is hard when people don't know positioning and are extremely slow with mechanics, got any logs for arts/arkk/siax?
---
Because ANET has one person fixing shit like this, one person fixing balance and two people (one and a temp) fixing major bugs.
---
The rest of the 300 people are making skins for the gemstore
---
Yet another team member leaving. Games dying by the day I swear.
---
Looks like too many people are trying? It always happens to me on the day of the sale/new update. And almost never when there is nothing 'special' to buy.
---
She's been there for almost exactly a year. The wiki lists her as a story editor, her Twitter lists her as Narrative Lead. A year there means she probably only worked on Icebrood Saga.
---
No, it was bugged and wasn't implemented during the balance patch. Now it (hopefully) has the intended buff.
---
Well, the sole person responsible for fixing story instances, dungeons, fractals, old world content, events and animations has woken from 6 years long coma, and decided to do their job starting with the number one priority.
---
I am not too worried about that considering that LS4 and LS5 prologue have been more reverent to the original game and it's lore than practically anything else that's been released.
---
Even in the vanilla launch version, all of the callbacks to the original or familiar locations just seemed more like Easter eggs for a loosely related game rather than part of the history for that world. That gulf just seemed to increase with LS1, LS2, and HoT.
---
LS3 started to swing back a little bit. Path of Fire did a much better job of feeling like the world we knew. Even if they trivialized the Ascension process a bit (my character's ancestors would have appreciated a random NPC opening augury rock for them rather than having to do Thirsty River. And also how did Hall of Ascension get so small?).
---
LS4 was actually very well done.
---
But the Ice-Brood Saga prologue feels like coming home. There may not have been a ton of narrative vets on the team, but that map is only one of a handful of places in the entire game world where it feels like I have been before. And I hope they keep moving in that direction.
---
My theory for this is that the old guard was burnt out on the all of the GW1 stuff and wanted to do something new and different and go in other directions to retain their interest. Now they are moving on, or have moved on, and new people are coming on board that are franchise fans and want to capture more of the original. And the game is all the better for it.
---
Don't know about game development, but there is always a very high turnover rate in software development. Nowaday, a dev working at the same place for more than 4 years is pretty uncommon.
---
https://i.imgur.com/GlfsVYk.png
---
Yeah it didn't get implemented during the balance patch.
---
Unless they do something that breaks the game rules, they shouldn't be worried about ban.
---
It's just gold time.

---
Thank you for this! How do you get this info?
---
Also it's craftable and pretty cheap to do.
---
I have a static group I run Fractals with, I just started getting burnt out, and I'm a bit of a hoarder so I'm trying to get over that haha. That "What if I need this!" Mentality, but it's been 7 years. I haven't needed it. 
---
I've made a couple legendaries (Meteorlogicus, Minstrel, HOPE), but Gift of Fortunes always just suck the soul out of me. HOPE was especially bad. But I got all my mats via laurels for the Heavy Crafting Bags, or from crafting the mystic clovers, or just straight farming. Didn't buy most of it. I'm trying to finish my Ad Infinitum, but i'm only missing the Gift of Fortune, hence the impetus for this post.
---
Thanks for the advice! It really does help a lot. And is a good push for me mentally to stop my hoarding ways.
---
no, just most of pof specs, and the core/hot builds designed to counter those specs
---
anet screwed up combat with those shitty dumbed down specs but they are here to stay same as any other toxic build that manages to perform against them
---
If you don't have a mount, shortbow thief is good. Auto attack tags, 5 shadow steps to keep up.

Gemstore cache thing in %temp%/gw2-gibberish/user/local/the~500kbgemstorefile, it's been there for years but no one has really bothered to go through it and post the "new" stuff after every patch. At least not publicly.
---
Probably because it's harder than usually. Did a few tries and was still a bit short on the time, so it's not something that a casual can get easily.   
---
but then anet doesn't want people crying about not getting stuff
---
Adding to that, the trait that allows you give ashes of creation to allies tags mobs for you since it uses your stats to calculate the damage. Mantras, opening and closing tomes all spread it with the right trait line.

If you are good at racing then you get the scarf easily. I'm gonna grind ToTs bags and buy the scarf because I suck at roller beetle in general.
---
It makes the achievement worth 30x cobs (&gt;150g right now). That's pretty significant imo
---
If you have a good ping and good at racing you get 120g equivalent and 10aps. If you have crappy ping or bad at racing you spend hours and hours of farming and then maybe get the item. Sounds very reasonable. Not like it's 3 cobs or anything :P
---
OMG my ranger looks the exact same. Minus armor ofc
---
Fixed it for yous.
---
I miss play my ex girlfriend...
---
Well, now I play with a girl who was her friend so... I can't complain
---
no rewards? so what are legendary armor, legendary backpiece, exclusive weapon skin?
---
and for the content thing. they release the new map, people hated about it. the release a mount and guess what, people hate against it :D
---
If a guild owner cares more about representing than the qualities of a player then odds are the owner gives no f***s about their members--they're in it for business/guild hall development. You should have made the move to leave that guild ASAP, because people who enforce 100% representing and threaten to KICK A GUILD VETERAN are extremely insecure, especially about their guild and its success.

You will always need every type of material for one reason or another. Selling materials is a choice but just remember you’ll have to farm them buy them sometime later this is true when crafting legendary weapons. 
---
The expedition home node is quite useful as any home instance node is. You can pick which materials from which region the expedition node brings you every reset. There are some resource nodes that provide seasonal materials like the adventure box baubles. 
---
As far as useful gem store items well gathering tools in general since they are unbreakable. The volitile or the unbound tools will get you extra of those magics if you have em. Uh if you buy/get the harvest glyphs. 
---
Everything in gem store has its advantages but nothing really game changing like giving you an edge in game.
---
&gt;  Unfortunately, once you have experience under your belt, you realize that they're just blowing smoke out their ass.
---
To give a counter anecdote, one job I had, I knew the at least 80% of the position details within a month. Inside of 6 months, I was solid enough in the workings to get two pay bumps. 
---
One of the big considerations on "turnover bad" is how long the acclimation process really takes. For technical stuff, you want to keep folks who know the niche issues.  
---
Inside experience benefits a narrative/creative lead too, but to get someone up to speed there, you can lob a sufficient amount of notes /books/records of previous work. Even better if the new employee's *played* the game before. 
---
So it might be a little disconcerting the narrative lead is leaving (consistency is a thing), but whoever ends up getting added to the team has plenty of opportunity to catch up without causing a huge crisis.

/edit: Works again as of now (21:58 pm GMT+2)
---
This particular person (Julia) leaving seems just like a  normal career move. 
---
What I meant was - now if some more of the people who have been added to the narrative team lately, also start to leave (Novera being the most prominent one of them.. I mean, she's awesome, right?) then we should get worried. Then it would signal something being off within the company.
---
But this so far seems just like a normal career path decision, someone who got the opportunity to work for Bungie took it, is all.
---
(edit: typo)
---
“But muh prestigeeee” &lt;— that’s the rub, IMO it’s a bit silly of a rub, but that’s just the way it is.

Same here. Cant log in.
---
Search for "Royal Flame Coffer" they won't show up as individual skins on the TP.
---
I'm surprised they didnt include the aurene shirt in this bundle too
---
thanks friend
---
The playerbase of PvErs is the largest. GW1 started out as a primarily PVP game. That didn't last long, PVErs took over with sheer numbers and the game pivoted to cater to them.
---
It's hard to monetize a small group of players. I agree it's probably easier to get PVPers to spend money (League of Legends, DOTA 2, CS:GO, Hearthstone, etc...) but you need to have the playerbase to do it. I would imagine the PVP and WVW communities are simply too small relative to the PVErs.
---
lol please notice sarcasm, i too belive anet not only lied to customers changing the focus on their game but also hurt more than everyboyde else their beloved veteran players who had started this joruney with them
---
i was a wvw focused player so you can imagine how happy i am with this last 2 years of neglect and censorship, plus all the monetization instead of fixes is driving me crazy
---
but thats it for me im leaving to cyrodiil, im done with that fake company called arenanet, and hopefully any other ncsoft related game, all they do is dissapoint on the long run
---
It'll depend on how many people want to complete the collection on year 1 (or rly want some skins) vs how many just care for the easy gold ... including all alt accounts in use.
---
Not creepin', but that makeup game is on point.
---
I just sorted my screenshots and found this pic were it looks like the Dragon Bash Dragon is about to eat a skyscale :) Thought it might be funny to share :)

it depents on your understanding of prestige

you could say God of PvP is a prestige Object  
---
the Chairs for W6-W7 CMs

or some infusions just cause of the cost of those
---
im still online and can switch characters on EU but the trading post kinda borked down and doesnt load item pages anymore.
---
Don't have the gem&gt;gold tables in front of me, but I'd vote for a Perm Bank Access Contract in a Shared Inventory slot.  May your bank merge into your inventory.
---
I'd say legendary armor is pretty prestigious, as well as HoT legendaries (Nevermore's quest was quite fun and work intensive).

---
You might want to do a similar test in an area with a higher population, as it's player count that really tanks performance for the most part.
---
Yeah it's possible to be an expert on the story without being an insider, though once you become an insider, you'll learn secret details like the outline going forward or little things that haven't been made public. But that's nothing compared to the technical side, where you go in completely blind and can still be caught off-guard going through someone else's code five or ten years into the job.
---
It's worth noting that Julia's only been at the company for a year and she was hired as a story editor. [She also retweeted this back during the big layoffs earlier this year.](https://i.imgur.com/uAFyYsp.png) It seems that she's been planning to leave for a while. She was made Narrative Lead in May, after the big layoffs.
---
[She retweeted this back during the big layoffs earlier this year.](https://i.imgur.com/uAFyYsp.png) Speculation: She was looking to leave since she arrived a year ago. "Bleeding" is a bit of an exaggeration here.
---
Firebrand tome has way more range than staff.

I thought the same thing but at least these are tradeable, if they were gemstore exclusive I would not be happy about these at all

Another small PSA, soul cake is just like 10s to craft.
---
My boss has an extremely good memory and often asks why I can't remember code I wrote a month or two ago. My response is always "I've slept since then".
---
I'm paid to write, not to remember. That's what documentation is for.
---
It's not a surprise, considering this dumpster fire of a company has been letting their game die a slow, agonizing death for over a year now. Even narrative designers are trickling out of this game like a sieve.
---
Looks like MO found a great time to jump off of this sinking ship.
---
staff auto is 1200 range and book 1 is 600 range
---
The new systems are interesting. I can't quite judge everything because I never played Forsaken or its related content before now. I agree there is a lot to do, but much of it feels samey (my god, they barely even made new dynamic events for the moon)
---
As for post-expansion content, you could say the same thing about GW2. That doesn't excuse how slim Shadowkeep's story.
---
*u wot?*
---
Throwback to when using it near door breakers in champion's dusk could get you oneshot by guards lmao.
---
Lol get real
---
F 
---
Idk what this says about myself, but without having measurables to min/max my DPS I really won't have much interest in playing.
---
It's really not slow. The pace of the game dying has been progressively picking up since the layoffs happened. Since August 30, it's picked up even more. I honestly don't see a future for this game anymore. If it were taken offline by this time next year, I wouldn't be surprised.
---
i think pof is insanely good value for that same reason. 
---
idk, as a looongtime destiny player I was quite happy with the story. certainly much moreso than forsakens, which people seemed to love just on the basis of the presentation of a few cutscenes. I haven't felt as excited for destiny as I did in the final shadowkeep mission in a loooong time--especially with the promise of more to come.
---
granted, I have a deep investment in destiny lore and the whole veiled figure statue and all that, as well as the end of raid reveal are all super interesting with regard to the future direction of the story, so i think it's likely a situation where the value increases the more invested you are.
---

---
&gt; Tie the gamemodes together via lore.
---
We had a Living World segemt breach into the Mists.  
---
Ho-ly shit were there complaints on all sides. PvE folks didn't want to get forced into Edge of the Mists. 
---
WvW folks didn't want PvE players, or anything that sniffs of PvE, in their game mode.
---
Upvote for having a girlfriend to play with
---
Of those two, the Ryzen processor. I think the benefit from the processor outweighs the loss in the GPU.
---
Well that is just bullshit. Entire infrastructure... damn, you are delusional.
---
Yet the ongoing content of the game is built around story. They don't do it well but its still built around story.
---
After August I haven't the luxury of having any hope for this game under current management.
---
While I might play MMOs to play with friends, I don't do it to invest in randoms I might encounter out in the world. I still solo quite a bit.  
---
And that's not just unique to playing GW2.
---
&gt; as is the bullet hell phase in Nightmare.
---
Seriously, this was my favorite mechanic in ALL of the fractals. The music and bullet hell together made it so unique that I absolutely loved dying to it lmao. I want more of this.
---

Anybody who buys these templates from anet is straight up stupid. Sadly they will make money off the whales from these templates. It's a damn shame. Fuck anet for these shitty templates.
---
oh boy :D
---
I adore the inquest duo. That's phenomenal.
---
Cilantro is both cheaper to buy and easier to get the seeds. I mostly use these for fractals and I already have 25% reduction from the omnipotion. Overall I also find being able to regain health is much more useful for sustain than pure reduction.
---
If I were making these for WvW I would probably go for the peppercorn version.
---
Anet really don’t want raiders playing the game anymore, huh
---
Biggest update in near future??????? Dude, there have been at least 3 promised huge overhauls of WvW and i'm still waiting for the first one.
---
There is allegedly something if you've beaten Joko., but I haven't gotten to that yet. Might be worth popping in to check.
---
:o
---
Yet MOB and the people he took with him were. When you put the 2 together its not a good look.
---
That's fair. I mostly use a sustain Deadeye in fractals, so the healing is fairly meaningless to me.
---
It's a Guild Hall Decoration. This year, you can craft the Mad King's Labyrinth walls for your guild hall, and the Visage is an interactable wall that causes the pumpkin face to protrude from the wall.
---
'ello
---
New Halloween scribe decorations for those that are curious but don't want to waste the time crafting it themselves. So far i've spotted 4 new decorations:  1) Visage of Madness 2) Ominous Fortress Wall 3) Ominous Fortress Wall : Angled 4) Ominous Fortress Wall : Corrupted. 3 of them are massive and will be great fun for those guilds that decorate! Plus the 4th is an interactive wall.
---
I love it when people just jump the shark and make "predictions" as if they know shit. Good luck to ya in what ever else you decide to do.
---
Instabilities are not bad per say, but the current implementation is really poor. 
---
Each fractal should have its own pool of instabilities which fits the fractal and there shouldn't be instabilities that contradicts each other or how the fights should be done.
---
So it's huge walls this year. I like it!
---
They're just trying to keep revenue streams up since they obviously aren't working on any new expac in the near future (or they don't have the funding to) So it's bandaid content and monetization for the foreseeable future. 
---
Which is too bad, I was looking forward to new elite specs (or even a new class would be interesting) and possibly new weapon types.
---
Maybe Anet is aware of all the feedback people have given and maybe they are changing mentioned stuff.
---
(I know it sounds like sarcasm but what is there except hope?)
---
You should have cut most of that down to summary of your concern and a clear suggestion, that was too much cutting off from your point throughout to go into some long history of this and that.
---
Any WvW player in an alliance will not want their sides performance effected by people in pve chopping trees or whatever else, at that point Anet should just make an open world pvp version of the mega server (an idea I've suggested since I don't see WvW mode having lasting power unless it's bastardized to feed other game modes). 
---
WvW players want to work on their builds and feel the thrill of executing their build roaming or in a group composition. The main reward for a WvW player is not having to be pulled away from WvW for anything that isn't garbage.
---
There are already enough built in group and squad tools, not enough people use them, but they're actually pretty good.
---
I hope so. 3 templates account wide is a joke.
---
we're very creative, I'll have you know
---
nice bait mate. omegaluö
---
That's definitely not the case for me.
---
In WvW the clickable button is Warclaw. In PvE it's Skyscale. I duck in and out for dailies all the time and it's never changed
---
Sick kill guys! Good to see new stuff like this continue to come out.
---
Or Steve the worm near wormgate. (also named by the community)
---
Damn, we have no imagination...
---
Ya but you can’t directly buy it off the gem store. Either luck from a black lion chest or off the trade post for like 700g I think but ya its handy.
---
&gt;  And that's not just unique to playing GW2.
---
But GW2 is intentionally built in a way that facilitates solo play.
---
Have to agree, I'm not a fan of AMD but the AMD is clearly better than that i3. That said, if you have a Costco membership they have some very decent machines online around the $500 mark.
---
Is power Mesmer (chrono/mirage) weak or am I just playing it wrong?
---
So I've been completing LS 3/4 maps on various characters (ranger/warrior/ele) and so far it's been easy and fast. However, now that I've started with my Mesmer (zerk gear/scholar runes) I find that my autos feel quite weak and every high damaging skill has a pretty long CD. I'm not too sure what's going on, I just feel like I was killing things and finishing hearts faster just 1'ing on other characters than my Mesmer who's spamming skills on CD.

Search for guides on lab farm. You can get a lot of trick or treat bags there which are quite pricey for now.

You should get into comedy.
---
I'm fine with the equipment tabs costing gems - They actually hold armor and are extra storage.
---
I think it's absolutely ABSURD and mobile-game-esque to charge for build STORAGE even when you aren't using it.
---
Festivals are *designed* to be reusable content that is cheap dev-wise but gives the playerbase something to do in between Living World episodes.
---
Welp, off to that then!
---
Got all my mounts bound to the num pad numbers. Still room for one more!
---
For the love of god please take your LFG down when your map is full this year. -he said knowing full well what would happen.
---
It looks like it's the same thing as last year, nothing new
---
I hope the STORAGE ends up being free. The equipment tabs store item so 2 or 3 per character makes sense. But the storage costing gems is dumb.
---
Holidays rarely get new content in any MMO. A couple new skins or rewards (if that) is generally all you'll get in other similar titles - FFXIV, WoW, etc.
---
Festivals are meant to be reliable, expected,  and tie into seasonal feelings and immersion than to actually implement huge changes to the game. What's the point, when it's only live for a couple of weeks or a month, anyway?
---
I bought it for 400g I think. But, I am not one to cry over spilled milk.
---
The story is just the framework on which gameplay is hung. It's at its best when it allows for interesting play sessions, nothing more. Some games can manage a fantastic story, but those are few, far between, and way too taxing on the writers. ANet realized that ages ago, which is why the novels are far superior to anything in game, and why the best story elements are the ones that propel you into interesting scenarios, while the stories everyone hates are the ones that forgo gameplay in favor of story.
---
I like how we're still not using the specifically designated "Festival" category for these parties yet.
---
Oh, I thought these were the old skins just back. Kinda like the jackal!
---
GW2 was the first major MMORPG to favor an action-oriented combat system. Its place in the history of gaming is an important one. Without its influence, games like SWTOR, Wildstar, and STO would have never gotten off the ground, and we'd still be using the same old mechanics of WoW, Runescape, and the first Fallout.
---
ANet's progress since launch hasn't been huge, but you have to consider how far ahead of the curve they were at launch. It seems trivial now, but it was really something to behold back in 2012.
---
i see you lack reading comprehension cause the guy said heal ren could outheal every single mechanic in the game. that's pretty clear. 
---
anyways, how does it feel to have such a revolting personality that you feel superior over this? god you have anger issues judging by how you've literally stalked whargarbl's posts
---
we get it: you have no irl friends and must get your endorphins from being an ass with a superiority complex online.
---
be a better person next time, nobody gives a shit how fast your kill times are, and they won't matter when gw2 dies. having a superiority complex over it reveals how meaningless of a life you lead. 
---
(lmao you're against pride which says everything i need to know about you)
---
What I actually meant was that you either have expensive stats to get when ever you make a build but you only do it once and if you plan it well you can just give another character that armor for what ever reason you stop using it on the first one. Or you have to change gear near constantly and if you take a break you get left behind.
---
The latter would have been the case if gw 2 would have gone with the treadmill.
---
heh neither, that 5hour difference is just oof xD
---
I'm sorry, what's their guild have to do with anything?
---
These are the [Mad Realm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mad_Realm_Mounts_Pack) mount skins. :)
---
Personally I love this because one of my brothers is named Steve.
---
How dare you!!
---
Why won't anyone think of the poor, poor people in /r/gw2economy  and /r/gw2efficiency ?
---
How are they supposed to leech- I mean - 'legitimately obtain' gold off of everyone else with selfish people like you giving heads up to all their uninformed vict- oh, excuse me-  'fellow entrepeneurs'?
---
The hubris!
---
What happened over 5 hours? It a reward from one of the mad king events?
---
thats a lot of emotions for being informed that healbrand is worse than heal ren. tsk tsk
---
lmao you don't even know who CnD are? literally the guild responsible for the current Mirage gameplay?
---
such aggressive posturing from a poseur that pretends not to be a casual - again, who even are you to be posturing like this? hc players won't care what casual players run because they have their own groups. you? a poseur. a posturer. an insignificant blip yelling out to be noticed, doing it in the worst way possible: instead of proving through actions, yelling at casuals.  stop willfully missing the point, you know what you are doing. stop.
---
Just a few weeks ago we had MOB leaving and taking senior people with him. This is on top of that. Its concerning.
---
Lol this was funny to read. All they proved is that could and of can exist next to each other - which has nothing to do what you are saying at all. Then demand you to further educate them? :D
---
I don't think any of their story has been done well and would like to see it improve. Multiple narrative leads leaving is not going to improve it. The better living stories are the ones that give you plenty to do after the story but that doesn't mean the story can't be improved and that improving it would lead to an overall improvement in the LSs.
---
Welcome to GW2! You honestly joined at a good time for new players because this event is a good way to gain levels quickly and make gold. Go to Lion's Arch as soon as possible and head to Mad King's Labyrinth. Then go on Looking For Group and find a squad that's farming the labyrinth, keep up with the squad, try to hit as many mobs as you can with a ranged weapon (gs or staff), and you'll be good!
---
Stick it in an infusion slot on some ascended armor to get the confetti aura.
---
Dont you eyeroll when you see a Partnerlook couple?
---
She started at ANet a year ago and she posted a couple months after that about Bungie hiring Narrative team members. This is not concerning.
---
&gt; If some new goober picks up the mantle every other year you´ll get a nastily chopped up story line with short bits from everyone but no great overarching line, or one that´s just bad.
---
So basically the Star Wars sequel trilogy.
---
It wasn't me downvoting you.
---
Lmao your post is as real as it gets, seriously. My last job was a total revolving door and I can say from firsthand experience how shit a company is to work at when you're stuck in a team with a lot of new hires that need to be trained. Holy fuck does it suck when you transition from a team with multiple veterans and everyone kicks ass and gets more work done than what the higher-ups even planned for, then months along the line when the veteran team members get moved around or promoted or leave the company you're suddenly one of few people left in the team who have been there longer than a month or two. It just plain **sucks** when things go from fast-paced and productive to suddenly struggling to meet deadlines because so much time is spent training and accomodating newer employees who need to adjust to the workflow. In my case, it meant we were on perpetual overtime and the environment was high-stress and chaotic... with no hope in sight of it ever getting better because of how enormous of a disconnect there was with team leads and team members. I can only imagine that Arenanet is and has been struggling in many different ways internally and I hope they can recover well from it but facing the facts, it doesn't and hasn't been looking good for a while now.
---
Wait you’re telling me gems aren’t shares of the company?
---
I up voted you. It's ok I'm use to it. I never care. Also I must have missed that point so thanks.
---
This isn't a roadmap, it's a release schedule. It even says so in the picture - "Calendar".
---
looking like the bosses of some golden sun game
---
Thanks you, your plugins helped a lot. I fully understand your points and i stand with you.
---
Really fucking dumb post. But still more worthwhile than the shitty art posts.
---
If not for being a twat then at the very least for that embarrassment of a joke.
---
Tried a few builds, but so far nothing can beat GS mirage.
---
Averaged 2.5 stacks of bags per hour
---
I'm not sure but I'd bet its in the black lion chests. Same thing happens every single time they update it.
---
Yeah gw2 doesnt use much of the gpu anyways. I was thinking about either Ryzen 5 2600 or 3600. Clearly 3600 is better but gpu is worse.
---
They can't hear you
---
Or Steve the northernmost stone head in the Wytchmire Swamp.
---
Delete this
---
&gt;I have no insight into the studio
---
ITT
---
If I could give you gold for this post after video posted by /u/WoodenPotatoes I would give you two gold instead.
---
Wow - they really want to do the thing they said they wanted to do last patch: Make the best melee weapon be a fucking melee weapon.
---
I don't think anyone - in the story or among the community/developers - are expecting anyone to just forgive and forget what the charr / Flame did.
---
If the “end game” was left as it was in 2012 the game would be in a much worse spot than it is currently
---
&gt;As a D2 player 
---
Why
---
These posts are so utterly pointless. Everyone always makes such a big deal about X dev leaving when in reality 90% of the devs who leave are just natural churn that every games/software developer goes through, usually on a 2-3 year cycle as projects finish or go into maintenance mode. 
---
Narrative Lead is a fancy title, but in a game that does episodic content and probably has most of the season planed out in advance, this isn't going to matter much. It's likely not a big loss, and is something you'll see often in the industry. 
---
This is the only game sub where people feel the need to post about all these no-name devs as if they're all as important as Kojima.
---
Ah yes, as opposed to the other, much longer Destiny story pieces
---
You're an idiot.
---
No more than carrots are part of farmland...
---
FFXIV?
---
&gt; all three types were announced to be monetized separately
---
Depending on the situation yeah, idk where you can actually get 3-5 stacks of agony as the guy mentioned, maybe Aetherblade if you keep getting hit by the lasers...?
---
I was thinking more about trying to heal up someone during Ensolyss orb phase, you got 2-3x aegis from heal, 1x from shield4 and that's pretty much it unless i'm missing something (not considering F3 during orb phase), not sure if the circles will proc the aegis/IB, and if you do aegis yourself just to get some extra modifier on heal then you sacrificed some quickness/party aegis that could come in handy after if party has slow CC.
---
But healbrand heals so much that even with 0 stacks of IB it should be able to heal up during agony, assuming that person isn't taking 5k dmg per second.
---
I shouldn't have to grind for basic quality of life features...
---
Here's the big issue with that way of thinking:
---
Once you add something to the game it is part of the game, it's literally in the game, we don't just count out Fractals or Living World, even though they go through the same troubles, [if not worse in some cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSD2aXhfCIE).
---
Like it or not, it may be the smallest community, but it's [by far the one with the most weight to pull around](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cp19st/elitist_raiding_party_3_trailer/).
---
People wanted it and love it and it's a real issue when the community subdivides and cherry picks because they don't like the content or see it the same way people who love it do.
---
People who actually put in hard effort and real thought into how others play the game are leaving more than regularly now and it's more than just signs of struggle at this point, they had a mass layoff, swapped CEO's (technically) before it and they won't even communicate about any of the issues publicly and shrug them off because they think everything is fine.
---
If you worked at Arenanet and saw that Icebrood Saga announcement, read the chat or any of the reactions and came out thinking it went great, you aren't meant for PR and you genuinely have to reconsider your priorities, and Arenanet isn't getting that right now.
---
You can't spell "you" properly, I think mindgaming the TP Barons might be a lost cause, man.
---
Llama mount... we needs Llama mounts!
---
I paid for this game so basic features that other MMOs offer for free should be included.
---
It's like trying to charge to view the world map...
---
woops
---
breddy mucho.
---
In what way?
---
I think they are a bit overdesigned. The metal is excessive, if they ditched it and only left soul energy + rock as a theme, it would look much prettier, with better readability and more cohesiveness. See the Focus which lacks metal parts, and it already starts to look better.
---
They're always mostly reused with new additions in terms of earnable cosmetics. It looks like this year has arguably the most new cosmetics in it (at least from my memory). Not only the flaming AC weapons, which look fucking awesome but also the graveyard-themed greatsword and the fucking coffin shield (just LOOK at it in game, it's my favorite shield skin by far) and, of course, the pumpkin head. there's also mini Mad Memories for the people who like minis and probably more. I didn't do a full inventory, but it honestly looks like a LOT more than we got even last year.
---
Not sure if applies to the Gem/Gold exchange, but I think there is a limit to how much you can exchange/receive.
---
Because a guy got annoyed while playing and decided to spend a way too many lunch breaks tinkering with the code.
---
Cool for a dark themed character, ^too^bad^I'm^not^into^that^type..
---
Uniqueness of rewards.... in MMOS? What year where you born in?
---
My favorite part is tha ***the ouroboros turns eternally***
---
ah; well that's totally up to you then. on which region will the F2P limitations hurt the least?
---
Ronald is always watching
---
why should he, not a game dev nor is he getting paid for it. not his job to figure shit out.
---
Why? They already confirmed the current one gets updated next episode, and strike missions are there to stay. Why add one that gets removed in a three weeks?
---
Doesn't that usually happen only for an extension?
---
I know you're being facetious but if there are more than about 15 people making store stuff I will eat my hat.
---
They're not omnivorous, they can eat cooked vegetables without getting sick but they need meat for most of their needs. They cultivate to feed their domesticated animals (cow, pig, chicken, ...) and to get spices for their cooking (like hot pepper barbecue sauce)
---
The bag/hr rate is much more dependent on your MF, not your class. That said, classes are really mostly a matter of personal opinion and I figured there might be some disagreement on that topic!
---
I personally prefer more mobile classes. Scourge is still mentioned for a reason as it *is* a viable option, just not one that *I personally* recommend. If it's your cup of tea, the build is there to be used!
---
I'm not planning to skip any of the chapters, I'm just wondering if it's worth doing that with a level 80 character.  
---
But you convinced me about the gear issue. I won't be able to be a capable healer without knowing my way around in order to get the correct gear for my character.
---
well I like them a lot.
---
\-wink wink-
---
Love the onslaught of fashion wars in this thread from you. I enjoyed every single one of them. It's asking a lot, so I don't expect anything. But could you make a post of the armor sets you all used in the 3 pics? That's like... 6 sets, so it's a bit ridiculous to ask. Still, there are some cool armor pieces that I'd like to look up.
---
I- I lost my hope and stop trying it long ago. Huh.. thank you stranger.
---
Mobility can be improved with sigils of speed and stamina. Perma swiftness and almost perma dodge, dodge matters due to it being a speed boost. I believe it's about 66% faster then standard run speed. Hard to notice with just 2 dodges, but perma dodge can keep you at the head of the pack where between marks and shades you can tag every mob going door to door with ease.
---
PvP will have a different system due to how builds work in it.  So these templates are pve/wvw only.
---
I wish there were a harder version of the jp with more bags. And for Wintersday the same.
---
thats literaly like 10th person from narative team leaving.... OK.
---
Yea it would be a nice addition, or even changing up the JPs each year just slightly.
---
The game survived for years without it and will continue to do so.
---
Sorry for the length, but I really did feel like the thought process needed to be put out. Of course, the cross-gamemode interactions were just examples of things that could be implemented. The point was that I want there to be options for people to play multiple gamemodes while contributing to something more meaningful than just their wallet or skin collection, something akin to the feeling of helping your team "win". My point here isn't to make WvW better as an end, but as a means to an end. Of course, you'd expect that if there is an implementation of systems like I'm suggesting, current WvW players should be able to play the content they want without having to run something silly like "20 PvE'ers playing meta tree-chopping builds" in their alliances. If you'll notice, one of my main suggestions near the end is to have content for different-sized groups in WvW like GvGs or even "high-value capture points" that require a minimum number of players surviving against an opposing team.
---
yes.
---
Cool then I'm not missing much. Glad I didn't spend $200+ just to play more content
---
[My man!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/365/833/638.jpg)

fanbois ...
---
It doesn't matter what you call it - it lacks endgame content.
---
Prepare for trouble...
---
Taco gives  you wallhack for nodes across the entire map.
---
Uncomportable Truth gotten downvoted. Take my upvote. This is, the Truth.
---
&gt; Okay, can someone please tell me how the fuck do people have 20-60 builds / character? I mean thats a very big overkill...
---
**Hint:** They _fucking don't._ 
---
This is a lie narrative to bitch about having to pay for what they used to get for free.
---
What video?
---
but i ordered a cheeseburger
---
They are in the Super Rare category, though.
---
That's in the "Last than 1 in 10 000 chances" territory.
---
Well 70 gold is worth like $3.50, so maybe they can afford it?
---
if your guild is overly reliant on an addon to raid and stop raiding due to lack of support of the said addon....you got more problems buddy.
---
Damn cats with their skull cups and they’re cool horns. I want to be a charr...
---
Yes and when Mike Z has sold all of his belongings to keep the servers alive just for *you* and everyone who doesn't care about stangation or passion we'll all be sad knowing what could have been. 😔
---
That's a little melodramatic too, don't you think? If people are looking for reasons to quit, they're going to find them. They just want their quitting/hiatus/break to have meaning or a target to attribute it to. This is just the next thing to tie it to.
---
And, again, I'm really salty that the arc templates are disabled. It's already proving to be a pain in the ass for me to swap between builds and quickly fill roles. At least I have [this for quick searching my builds still](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dghg3z/i_made_a_tool_for_people_with_too_many_arc_builds/)
---
What's WvW?
---
I imagine it's less that, but more so the straw that broke the camels back.
---
Shouldn't this be the least problem in a guild run, especially for the chrono who doesn't have to adjust two multiple off chronos, revs, heal scourges and fb?
---
You mean the weekly vendor? That isnt even enough to eat anything at all from what gets farmed in the time of the event + all the stuff thats in the TP.
---
You can't really effectively complain about it now after it has been made abundantly clear many times previously that they're willing to let go of your community. 
---
Like the WvW/PvP community, once you come to terms with that fact you'll enjoy the game a lot more positively. It's free and casual after all, so there's no bit commitment that needs to be made. Just enjoy it for what it is and not what it isn't.

---
I'm not a part of these players with insane amount of templates but some of my friends are and the best answer I can get is "minmaxing".
---
For example in FotM, you can swap sigil for almost every level.
---
You also benefit from potion for a bonus in boon duration/precision, so these template are also different from raids where you don't have that.
---
Include some very specific build for a certain type of play (tryhard, portal, lowmanning) and you can see how it goes exponentially.
---
