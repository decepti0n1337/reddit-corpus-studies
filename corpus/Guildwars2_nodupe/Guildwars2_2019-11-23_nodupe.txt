I completely agree with the spirit of this. I waited almost 18 years for a favorite TV show to get a decent remake based on the comics it was pulled from, so yeah, I'm totally willing to wait for quality content that tells a great story.
---

---
That being said, the comparison falls apart there, because imagine reading a science fantasy series of books that come out once every couple of years, then they change to magazines once every 4 months, then they change from science fantasy to doing horror stories.
---
I, the reader, am confused. And not sure if I want to keep buying these books/magazines/whatever they are now.
---
^(I just want my science fantasy books back like please don't make this whole saga horror themed I'm begging you Anet ugh...)
---
---
---
You also spouted bullshit like pretending the only reason I take issue with the story is because I want lack of realism and fanfare at every corner when gw2 story fails both from a fantasy and a realism perspective as a story for all the reasons already stated, lack of stakes, lack of arcs, lack of forshadowing, extremely predictable story, bad dialogue, no actual conflict, bland characters, ect ect.
---
I was gonna say "add a table of contents" but then I saw the button, pressed it, and I was impressed with the UI. Very cool.
---
Daybreak is making planetside 3...
---
Hey, that's completely fine. Don't succumb to feel like you're missing out just because you can't grind as much as others or anything.
---
Playing to have fun is the best possible way to go about it, especially in such a casual friendly game as GW2.
---
Enjoy your time!
---
Yeah and they said they are working on another EQ. They aren't abandoning their other titles though.
---
The problem isn't making something new. It's making something new at the cost of killing off the other title first.
---
Though to be fair, the points made by most can only come from ”true” fans but I’d rather call them dedicated. I mean someone who has only managed to gear and level one character won’t complain about the Build Template update. The complaints will be coming from people who has multiple builds and multiple characters, aka those who dedicate a good chunk of their time in the game. The radio silence from Arena net won’t really bother who’s currently trying to catch up on the content, but it will bother those who’s already done it and are having worries about the games well being. Sure, not every complaint is from a die-hard fan but logically the majority of them *has* to some extent be long-term players.
---
Looks like feathers
---
Hmm. I think there's a way they could still pull it off.
---
Executing the action skill gives you a bundle, from which you can then pick the appropriate skill.
---
A bit hackneyed, but possibly a workaround.
---
Bogy needs to do a better job on the grammar.
---
Also what's the difference between gold/silver/bronze?  
---
I got gold once and silver the day after, but the rewards looked the same to me.
---
Well, the poster on the forum said this is basically just a summary from people's questions. They talked about more things (I am currently watching the stream and doing summary for wiki), but what I liked they said that what happened offscreen in EP1 will come later back into play, for example.
---
 I used to play gw2 on mac with 10fps and I was more than happy! 20-30 fps is more than acceptable!
---
&gt;1.I like this content so you are not allowed to dislike it and vice versa.
---
The "counter criticism" tends to be more about the *way* people choose to criticize things. If someone says "I don't like this thing," then I haven't seen too much pushback to that. But if someone says "this thing is objectively BAD and ANet should change it because *I* don't like it," then of course there will be pushback from people who disagree, because they don't want ANet to take that position seriously. 
---
&gt;2.Because I don't play this content, it does not matter.
---
Often this is the case though. Everything has a cost. Any time ANet spends on a certain feature, is time *not* spent on something else. If a feature is not of value to the game as a whole, then that is *worth* pointing out. This is good for ANet because it prevents them wasting time on features that will not be appreciated by the general community. This is good for most players, because it means that the more important features will get the focus they deserve. And ultimately, it is good for the players who enjoy niche content, because they will not develop an inaccurate impression of their own importance, and will be more grateful for whatever they *do* get, and if that is not good enough for them, they will understand their position in the community and move on to a game that is more catered to their own tastes, where they will be happier.
---
Dinosaurs are not cold blooded. The closest relative to dinosaurs are the birds, it is funny that chickens are closest to T Rex.
---
&gt; Admittedly, the Boneskinner and the Icedaddy are too easy :) We are working of a fix and I apologize for that! 
---
Oh thank you. I do retract some things I've said.
---
However, I do want to forward some things you're probably already aware of, but I feel needs to be said:
---
Part of the brilliance of GW2's open world design is the fact it can bring many different kinds of players together for a common cause.  More skilled players can handle complicated mechanics and commanding, while those of a lesser skilled level can be a number.
---
I appreciate when an open world event is challenging because it demands that people come together in a very pro-social way. It's not like raids where we sometimes don't want people. Most of the time everyone is welcome in a squad.
---
Please do not shy away from more challenging meta events. As long  there is a reason for us to band together (like Tequatl, as opposed to Serpant's Ire), you will see us commanders guiding the zerglings to victory.
---
Of course, you folks have already have Drakkar planned. I look forward to playing it. Good luck!
---
Yes, expect the saga episodes are smaller and more poorly done.
---
That is still really good. 75 ice shards is a joke to get.
---
There is also an easier way to do it, just go under Asgeir's Legacy (the same place where you do Lighting the Legacy), there will be the same freezing effect all time without having to wait for the meta to be active.
---
thanks, im glad
---
Mannnnn what is it with your little passive aggressive one line zingers before your post xD your posts are fantastic without them. I’m not new I just don’t know these things and thank you for explaining them to me it’s cool facts.
---
Idk why this gets downvoteded. So true
---
I think Zhaitan had the best design but the best executed (so far and probably because of experience) is certainly Kralkatorrik.
---
Pretty much like Anet as a whole. So disconnected from reality.
---
I agree, Merciless would look Good!
---
Thank you for doing this for the community! You’re awesome. Your post says “hey guys, there is Yara” I think you meant “hey guys, this is yara”
---
While the enemy raptor type commonly seen across central Tyria is certainly a dinosaur, Elonian raptors do not appear to be actual raptor, but rather reptiles that were named raptors because they look similar. Raptors don't have scales, instead having feathers, which central Tyrian raptors fit the criteria.
---
If you want it to fit the color of your armor but also your gloves, I would go with either :  
---
Dreamthistle Axe [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dreamthistle\_Axe\_(skin)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dreamthistle_Axe_(skin))  
---
Or Branded Axe  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Branded\_Axe\_Skin](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Branded_Axe_Skin) 
---
If you're willing/it's possible to put your gloves green, i'd go with : Seven Reapers Axe  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Seven\_Reapers\_Axe.jpg](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Seven_Reapers_Axe.jpg)
---
Sick screen
---
Even smarter way haha
---
It definitely is, just wanted to clarify it wasn't unlimited!
---
And they do take karma as well, but that's fairly easy to get. I'd rather spend karma and ice shards than volatile magic!
---
Final Fantasy, WoW, and ESO all have significantly bigger content releases with (more importantly) much more replayability. Those 3 are currently the biggest competitors... so your statement is simply false
---
+1 for jumpscare realism.
---
"Oh crap, I wasn't looking. What happened? Shit, Braham's dead."
---
How is that toxic?
---
Definitely Zhaitan, but if Primordus' full model looks anything like the [concept art](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b93a15b735ac53f1e9aeb3bd370b6b9f/tumblr_mjietrpD9H1rtdsh3o8_1280.jpg) from the [Dream of Primordus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dream_of_Primordus) item, I'm real excited.
---
Long story short MO was pissing away all the overhead profits from gw2 into side projects. 
---
NC soft came by one day, gave MO a reality check and a good spanking, and shit canned his projects and told him to get back to work. 
---
MO did not like this and took his ball and went home.
---
Man...the dad bod of a turtle was under that storm
---
interested to see what jormag will look like in the end
---
Working on finishing some of the Bound by Blood achievements, and I'm interested in Grothmar Tribune. I must be losing my mind though, because I'm not sure what  the Grothmar Legionnaire meta is that has to be completed 15 times? Can someone refresh my memory please? I'm struggling to even find it on the wiki.
---
If you're alright with a different shade of blue, might I recommend the [Axe of the Dragon's Deep](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Axe_of_the_Dragon%27s_Deep)
---
Try Sons of Svanir on Bitterfrost Frontier, especially Brute (GS) type. Their attacks hits like truck.
---
I got like 6 boxes. People that regularly run with me got 4+.
---
Rngesus hates you it seems :(
---
This one has neither...
---
How can you be okay with that resolution?!
---
Some Mordant Crescent enemies from Paladawan and Great Hall meta had this attack as well.
---
There are NPCs in almost every mount race though.
---
Because they want to crack down on multiboxing now for SM. They dont want people getting 100g items on their alts and then logging out daily.
---
Some people assume without thinking that anyone with somewhat popular guild tag like SC is toxic elitist.
---
"usually?"
---
They did that once, on the oldest LW season.
---
A few hours back, a guy popped a tag, asked in map chat if anyone wanted to do it. Took us about 10 minutes to fill the group.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cropping_(image)
---
**Cropping (image)**
---
Cropping is the removal of unwanted outer areas from a photographic or illustrated image. The process usually consists of the removal of some of the peripheral areas of an image to remove extraneous trash from the picture, to improve its framing, to change the aspect ratio, or to accentuate or isolate the subject matter from its background. Depending on the application, this can be performed on a physical photograph, artwork, or film footage, or it can be achieved digitally by using image editing software. The process of cropping is common to the photographic, film processing, broadcasting, graphic design, and printing businesses.

There are additional ways as you said, but it doesn't mean that the Essence Manipulation mastery isn't doing those educational things.
---
We could move to a system where it enhances core combat mechanics per your examples. I think that is a great idea for a way to educate folks! Kudos :) I would say that this wasn't our only goal with the Essence system and with it being in a mastery line there were other considerations that we needed to make that helped drive us in the direction we went.  
---
Again, really great suggestions!
---
Of course! Any time :)
---
I'm referring to the quality of the legs of the moose in particular here. Jagged edges
---
Obsidian Armor is not the same as that gem store armor.
---
Both looks bad.
---
Then the gyro is completely useless. Doesn't generate enough barrier to offset the damage. There is no point in using it in PvP or WvW, because you don't solo in PvP as a scrapper regardless.
---
There is always couple groups around reset time, also try doing it after meta is over.
---
Mordremoth wasn't literally the jungle. That was a misnomer for poeticness on Canach's and Trahearne's part to represent the fact that Mordremoth's mind domain allowed him to transfer his consciousness to any part of his corruption. His core body, however, was the snake-like creature dubbed as the Mouth of Mordremoth.
---
That said, the concept art for Mordremoth's designs were far cooler.
---
As for my favorite Elder Dragon appearance: GW1 Primordus. That model doesn't have wings or forelegs/arms like the others, but instead has four tendrils at its shoulders. His GW2 redesign of the face is rather meh, and hints that they got rid of this fascinating design from GW1.
---
This is an excellent idea! We had this in our original plans for the map as well. The map is a bit smaller and so it became hard to segment those areas without sacrificing enough variety for players to engage with. I will say we are expanding on this map with episode 2 ;)
---
Again, great thought process!!
---
2 out of 3, got the celestial axe which i will never use :&gt;
---
I like GW1 Drakkar's design, it was supposed to be Jormag at first.
---
Yea I hear what you're saying. You're not wrong either. There was an original idea like the sirens of or orbs that floated above the character's head that we prototyped. Those became really hard to see during events with other players. We tried effects as well but those were even worse for visibility.
---
Grothmar Legionnaire is listed under the "Daily Grothmar Valley" achievement section. Basically do at least 3 dailies per day for 15 days to get the Grothmar Tribune achievmenet :)
---
It would require new(ish) tech, but it could also be in instances where specific stuff isn't flagged for ambient dialog. These are things we can investigate. :)
---
And the art for Jormag with Icebrood Saga does imply Jormag has the same head as Drakkar from GW1... while Drakkar is getting a complete redesign...
---
I'm sorry you felt that way! We do have a long list of rewards in the Weapon Collections reward track. Exotic Sceptor, Summonable Raven pet, dragonreder helm, 20,24,28,32 slot bag recipes, 20 and 24 slot bags, guild decorations, etc.
---
They've upped the ammount of rewards you get when it is that map's daily. Someone did the math somewhere on reddit the other day and you end up getting more map currency rewards than you did before.
---
Awesome, looking forward to it! One day u can focus on harder stuff for the medium and hardcore players and the other you can give the lighter content. Just like the fractals have this balance and we love it. Same process can go for world bosses (I'm the triple trouble fan). People might not understand at first but that might change with communication and when they see a pattern. I'm glad if anything we say can be of help. Wish the team all the best with your work!
---
FWIW, I don't disagree one bit :). I think players coming into the game for the first time would benefit from some form of breakbar tutorial and/or combo field tutorial, etc.
---
I've passed the feedback on :)
---
I mostly agree.
---
Ideally Anet would have GW2 running and supported, while having released at least one new title already. This would've prevented the mass lay offs, too.
---
Now with a much smaller team (~250 people?) Anet will struggle to keep LS going while developing a new title and expansion. They weren't able to do so with 400 people and I doubt they are able to with 250.
---
Risk of a third expansion depends on team size. With a 10 people team risk is low. With 100 it is high.
---
Anet seems to be run inefficient - for years. MMOs are longterm projects. So there should be tools which make creation of content easy and fast. Instead of 20-30 map expansions we got 4 maps. Do I need to say more?
---
In some games 12 year olds can glue together maps with story/"events" etc. within an hour. Professional and well made maps would take more time, sure. But 4 map expansions? Really? 100 people team, 2 years? So it took 25 people a whole year to create a single map? This is incompetent management, wrong priorities. It becomes a huge problem when a game gets olds and teamsizes shrink.
---
As comparision see GW1 expansions with their "no one knows" amounts of maps. 30? 40? EoTN has 18 dungeons. Why not a GW2 expansion with 10-20 new dungeons?
---
Anet creates pretty high quality content for GW2 - but lacks quantity. That's a huge problem - and has always been since 2012. Instead Anet prefers to create the fourth frog race or redigns LA for the fifth time (old, burning, rubble, new). New LA could have been a new map - just to name a single example. Many story instances could've been re-used as new dungeon paths (as example caudecus mansion story part in lake doric). That's simply inefficiency. Inefficient management (same as throwaway content of LS1).
---
So yeah, the whole mess is happening since at least 2012. Players have communicated this thousands of times, debated it for years, nothing changed.
---
Honestly I like both!
---
I'm sure you've tried a lot, but I'm just saying the current version is hard to see and I end up just forgetting that it even exists. I'm hoping they'll become more impactful in the whole saga
---
Explain to me how you came to this conclusion.
---
I play condo holo so I came to fight you and then I read the image
---
Use hammer or shield block when you use bulwark, it blocks the damage transfer
---
I'm guessing that you have a 2018 Macbook Air.

---
Let's just go over a couple things... 
---
* CPU - Processor
---
* GPU - Graphics Processing Unit. 
---
* Integrated Graphics = CPU = CPU + GPU
---
* Dedicated Graphics = CPU + GPU. 
---
Integrated Graphics means that you're sharing your finite system RAM with your CPU/Processor (i5-8210Y).  Consuming extra RAM isn't going to make GW2 faster because CPU's aren't optimized to handle the same sorts of calculations as GPUs.  
---
Having a dedicated GPU means that your CPU can delegate some tasks to your GPU to handle faster and more efficienctly using its own video RAM (vRAM).  GPU's have their own hardware including *faster* RAM &amp; numerous graphics cores.  
---
https://www.windowscentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-gpu
---
This article has a good TL;DR, but you should skim over the entire thing. 
---
Processors that have a "U" as a suffix (eg; i5-8250U) are designed to be energy efficient.  They're known as ultra-low voltage processors and generally are find for every day tasks up to and including high-res video streaming.  "Y" processors such as the i5-8210Y that your 2018 Macbook likely has are similar, but a little different they're "passively" cooled. 
---
You can read an article about that if you want, but the gist of it is active vs. passive cooling.  Passive cooling is mostly something reserved for super thin laptops such as ultrabooks or your macbook air.  Basically, you don't have nearly as much cooling potential as a traditional laptop that draws much more power under a peak load and needs more cooling.  
---
Lots of these U/Y processors can temporarily boost their speed, but this is limited by their thermals/heat.  For example, you don't want them running a **90-95 celsius** indefinitely!  So in the contexts of GW2 you're getting bad FPS because your processor isn't meant for gaming and your integrated graphics don't really give you any headroom.  The burden is almost entirely on your CPU to perform a mismatched task.  
---
Having a quad-core processor is kind of a minimum for modern gaming.  Depending on how well the game is optimized the CPU can delegate other tasks (think of it like having brothers/sisters to help bake a cake).  Unfortunately, GW2 isn't super well-optimized and runs on a highly modified GW1 engine.  ArenaNet does what they can, but it's still heavily limited by processing power (IPC) and the main-rendering thread. 
---
This isn't to say that you need to spend a mint on a new gaming desktop or laptop, but there are plenty of other options that'll run GW2 reasonably well (significantly better than your Macbook) under $1000.  The main thing is really what sort of compromises you're willing to accept (eg; brightness, color contrast, keyboard, touchpad, temperatures etc).  
---
https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/363278/the-best-cheap-gaming-laptops
---
(lots of these sorts of laptops have been on sale over the past couple weeks) as we creep towards Black Friday and Cyber Monday next week.  /r/LaptopSales is something I've been scanning looking for a good student PC.  You'll quickly get a sense for how people feel about certain models (eg; they really like the Acer Helios 300).  However, do your homework! 
---
There are dozens of iterations of hardware (eg; for a review of the Acer HElios 300) I'd search for this model number: 
---
PH315-52-78VL - and make sure that the review is for that specific hardware configuration.
---
I want you to know that I was thinking of you during this moment, hence my little jig. I can't reveal certain things! But I hope this helps :) Spoilers!

hmmm, i wonder where anet sold PoF where shipping, local game seller, box production costs actually matter. You missed out on publisher cost too, fyi. /s
---
Does Elixir S block it as well?
---
Of course! I want to be available as much as I can :)
---
Hoozah! Thank you and we DO care!
---
Thank you! Feedback has been shared with that designer :)
---
it's not as if it is out of character for anet employees to blame the players for not liking their decisions.
---
Mobz got feelz too ya know!
---
Wait, people are annoyed with that frost effect on you when meta is happening? What? Why? It's small, only on the outskirts of your screen and you can get rid of it easly.
---
And craft the new 32 slot bags (which are cheaper and far more accessible to the average player!)
---
There's almost always 2 in every one of my games on the enemy team. Oh the joys...
---
K.
---
Apparently he was on a prototype team working on something Guild Wars related. The team left the company together.
---
Guild Wars 2 was released 7 years after Guild Wars: Prophesies, so it makes sense that we'd be getting a new game around this time.
---
Issue is... GAMES AS A SERVICE! $$$$$
---
How was that toxic at all. You need to stop being so delicate.
---
At least try a little harder than this.
---
I'd go for one of the icy themed skins since you're going the whole Grenth, dark mage look.
---
I've been lead to think that the Sons of Svanir are not exactly working with Jormag's intent in mind. Jormag wants to lure everybody into willingly becoming icebrood/minions, while the Svanir actively slaughter anybody they don't think is worthy.
---
Meanwhile, GGG has half the number of developers, and is working on another league, a mobile version and Path of Exile 2, at the same time, giving tons of content nonstop.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And all Anet need to do is launch new things like elite specs, just for us to be a little happier.
---
I hope they really play with the good dragon or bad dragon story. They could do a lot with that.
---
I thouroughly enjoy when they add the various mount skins into the actual world itself. Really lets you know that they DO exist beyond being cash shop goodies.
---
Then again, the Black Lion gem store IS canon and exists in the game. SO every skin is canon and exists somewhere, technically.
---
Can I have a boneskinner minion? I'll promise to take care of it... and feed it.. and walk it every day! I'll even do all my homework and clean my room!
---
Damn. Knowing that Jormag can influence people unsubtle ways it's hard to interpret whether he got through to Asgeir or not. We know that some willing follow Jormag's words and others are influenced without knowing they are influenced. The way Asgeir  seemingly contradicts himself about not striking a deal with the dragon, but then rationalises his own reasons for actually doing what the dragon says while saying it's voice sounds like home... it really reads like he was influenced and didn't know it.
---
&gt;  I will say, making a mastery system for a single map is much less expensive and time consuming than an entire tutorial for the things you mentioned above.
---
I have to say that this is a poor response. While yes, I would understand that a mastery is possibly less expensive and less time consuming than producing a tutorial, it's also less effective.
---
I'll use my girlfriend as an example. She's not an English speaker, so there's a barrier of entry right off the bat, but she's not totally inept at gaming.
---
To this day, after at least 4 years of playing Guild Wars 2, she doesn't know what CC is or even what to do in the event of a break bar. Yes, us players CAN teach each other. That's the whole point of a community. But realistically, that isn't always the case. And I'm not always there to help her and other players won't always be as helpful or talkative.
---
I guarantee you that if she were to log in and play Episode 1 that she will not understand or know what Essence Manipulation does. Neither will she know how to effectively use it.
---
She's the type of player that still spams 2 through 9 because that's all she was taught to do by the game. Nothing, as of now, has told her or had her experience what would happen if mob did X and you had N skill to counter it. Etc.
---
Placing my girlfriends skills aside, I've ran into many players who still struggle with various combat mechanics as well. A lot of them veterans like me.
---
You guys have a great stage set for a proper tutorial and it boggles my mind just how underused it is. The entire first level stage is perfect to teach all of these things. And it should be fully utilized as a scripted event for all new players. And it should later be an OPTIONAL stage for alts, no one wants to repeat a scripted tutorial 40 times over.
---
Honestly, failure to properly tutorialize the early stage and teach proper mechanics to players HURTS the game in the long run. And the more you guys add to it with things like Essence Manipulation and what ever other mechanics you guys deem to add to the combat in future releases, only adds more to the pile of things that a lot of people will not understand without proper explanation. Now I also understand that newer mechanics, much like the essence manipulation, aren't things you could just keep retroactively applying to an early stage tutorial and they can be explained in their proper release. But those types of things all contain core mechanics that today aren't well introduced to players. And that is fact.
---
And a blog post won't be the solution either. Not everyone reads those. I'd wager that most casual players don't even hit the website after account creation. I'd even bet that most don't even know that this sub exists! (Not that I blame them for that either)
---
Not everyone is as dishonest as us pirates. And by pirate I mean I sail the high seas... um... yeah, please don't knock on my door CIA.
---
[removed]
---
Unrewarding and boring. Dead game mode.
---
Thank you for the update. I use this site to check if any cheap or easily acquired items end up on the wardrobe unlock so that I can get them on my own and guarantee I get something of value from the unlocks themselves. So far it’s been working out great.
---
I sincerely hope ANET is developing a singleplayer game, considering design trends.
---
ANET has become fantastic at story. But being an MMO limits them from telling the story they really want to tell because they have to balance it with other content.
---
So make account bound rewards?
---
I think this is the new trend of reoccurring posts
---
Just like with that one item that turned into a construction site sign
---
I am also afraid this will make people stop doing new SM as soon as everyone will have weapon sets . In a year time people will still do first one because its always good to have that chance for some nice gold, but the second one will be dead..   
---
  
---
Also the first one have violetale magic, so its always good to do it and later spend it on lots of different rewards from season 4. New one have no currency as there is no new corrency...   
---
Anet wtf?
---
It is harder so casuals don't do it but you can easily find group in lfg. Not that many like for other strike but still there are many.
---
Actually there are less strike cause there is no real drop. I mean ingot ok but what else? Nothing so no real reason to try it every day
---
Strongly disagree. There is nothing impressive about the latest episode mechanically or narratively, to use that as an example. But it's true, they seem to have an odd fascination with cramming singleplayer elements into an MMO, so a pure singleplayer game would definitely be a better fit.
---
While I agree the story instances are horse shit for gameeplay, I have to disagree on story.  I believe the story itself is fantastic.
---
But you can instantly clear frost effect if you use raven statues, these are many of them in meta-area.
---
Is it me or u Just have 2 real drops out of 4 this time ? 
---
The first is always the BL statuette and the second always a dye.
---
It is even less random then ever.
---
you know it is a video game right?
---
/u/Anet-Clayton , does anything in this update explain to the player: 
---
How Yarix found the pylons. Did he find them? Did he make them? Where did he find the knowledge on how to use them? Why doesn't he have more to say? (to me, he is the most deus ex character in the entire game since Taimi's machine.)
---
how did he figure out that the creatures magics can be turned on eachother, 
---
why do fallen exist, and what are their origins,
---
why did he choose these random three names when there was clearly supposed to be a link to actual norn lore indicated by the icons of the orbs and the mastery lines themselves?
---
So far, I found one single NPC conversation about the lore of aberrant creatures. 
---
Yarix has so hilariously little to say about it, that it makes it feel like EM was put into the game before it was ready.
---
Much appreciated! I check daily my progress to see when my wardrobe unlocks are worth using. Currently they are 100g value on average!
---
The living world seasons are additional content released by the developers, which were all once free. They give achievements, items, mastery points, and story stuff. They're very optional but season 3 and season 4 offer new maps each episode.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World 
---
Once you log in within this time period, you'll get Episode 1 for Icebrood Saga unlocked but it'd be unplayable until you purchase an expansion 
---
More details on expansions here: 
---
https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF 
---
Though I highly recommend you do the free to play first and go from there. Don't worry about the expansions or any additional content until you explore everything you can in the base game.
---
This will ensure you won't feel too bombarded with content. Plus it sets a steady pace for learning the basic mechanics.
---
The expansions are all max level content (level 80) so there's really no rush.
---
When you first make a character, the best professions that I'd recommend for new players would be Guardian (heavy armor), Ranger (Medium Armor) or Necro (Light armor).
---
There are 3 professions in each armor class, but those are among the easiest to get into.
---
Try all of them though, they are all vastly different in their playstyle.
---
Hopefully this helps.
---
Given that raptors have to pant to regulate their body temperature, we can assume they're warm-blooded.
---
Were pocket raptors ever actually nerfed?
---
Actually last episode does many interesting new things
---
Tone is darker but what is more interesting is that story is moved on with map group events.
---
Helping during rituals Orr freeing camps for story are done using the very same map events u get in world exploration.
---
Never seen this before in gw2 
---
And btw maps are getting better and better in look and atmosphere
---
Some people really don't want to hear this, but devs being harassed to the point of doxxing and death threats being sent to their *family members* is not at all uncommon anymore. With the climate of this subreddit at the moment I am not finding it hard to believe that it would be a possibility for devs to get hate just because they posted an answer, honestly.
---
No. Most people who spend money have little time and little skill (obviously they can't practice much). So how do you keep them playing? Avoid frustration, that is content where they could fail. All those finished story instances and finished events give you achievements or little bouncing reward chests. Little hits of dopamine. Keeps your target audience engaged so they later can spend money on the cash shop to win even more in fashion wars.
---
I definitely agree with his point, and you can see it around here with people already announcing "Icebrood saga is *ruined* because episode 1 didn't drop an expansion's worth of material!" 
---
Still though, it is important to keep pacing in mind, that GW2 episodes are not exactly TV episodes, in practical terms they are closer to entire seasons, because there are 2-4 month gaps in between. When there are such long gaps, there is more onus to tell more complete stories in each, and to not be so expecting of the audience to be fine with holding on to a cliffhanger for several months as they would across one week.
---
isnt that what the handle system on the official forums is supposedly going to allow now? Unless i am misunderstanding it.

Dragonhunter gets more active virtue skills, traps, and a longbow (though it's not really used in end game PvE). Firebrand's virtues pull out tomes with limited usage and 5 new skills each, they also get mantras and can use an axe. For playstyle PvE Dragonhunter runs as a power DPS with lots of burst damage with greatsword and sword/focus or scepter/focus. Their F1 ability becomes [Spear of Justice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spear_of_Justice) which impales a target and causes you to do more damage to them, very important for your damage. Firebrand usually runs as condi DPS with axe/torch and scepter they use their [tome of justice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tome_of_Justice) and other skills to apply huge amounts of burning. Firebrands are also able to apply quickness with a mantra (and guardians in general can use ["Feel My Wrath"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/%22Feel_My_Wrath!%22)) so they are pretty popular for that as well. guardians (3-4) can cover group quickness with just feel my wrath, fractals will prefer healing or power firebrand to cover quickness by themselves (power FB is just like DH but without the trap or spear), raids want the higher sustained damage from a condi quickbrand vs the burst from power. I'd suggest [checking the builds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) for the game modes you're interested in (WvW for instance runs really tanky healing firebrands). You also might want to just take a look at the wiki pages on [Dragonhunter](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragonhunter) and [Firebrand](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Firebrand) or just ask more questions here.

I had some annoying and very noticeable ping spikes in previous weeks - every few minutes the server would stop responding for 1-2 seconds but these spikes stopped occurring for me about a week ago(EU). I've been playing for excessive amount of time recently so I am sure they are gone for me.
---
It is exactly its purpose . If u do not use raven statue u freeze to death. It is a wonderful mechanic
---
They've tried "just living story" and they've tried expansions, and they've seen the results of both paths. 
---
They have chosen to go the path of "just living story" this time, which indicates that there is some reason *they* think it is going to be better overall. 
---
*We* can't really understand this decision until we see what they do with it by the end of the season. Personally, I can see potential advantages to the seasonal approach, as they can pace out the story rather than dumping the entire thing at once, and they can pace out new features to be relevant to the story, rather than dumping them all at once. 
---
For example, if Icebrood does contain new Elite specs, they can be released in a later episode, where they fit into the story, possibly even in staggered groups, rather than all dumped in at once and everyone scrambles to fill them out.
---
Could be anyone if u cannot identity the source. Even someone outside company. And if identifed he would be fired
---
Ive actually had a similiar build for doing the first strike mission in public squads. I went for a D/D or S/X weaponset personally, due to the personal dps on P/P being that much lower and for the current boss youll be missing the cleave( although you bring a good point with pistol #2 as a good source of vulnerability)
---
And if you are going for the other weaponsets, Deadly Arts is also better for your personal dps than Trickery. The additional boons from Trill of the Crime are always appreciated, but those are only for 5 people instead of the deadeye ones being for 10
---
okay, so what is your argument against implementing something like the dev-handles change that Anet is now using in the official forums
---
Strike missions are easier than any boss in dungeon, fractal or raid tho? I dont think it needs currency as long as they're a target dummy.
---
I think that snowflake hasn't been visiting any content outside his cozy RP guild
---
That is the problem, though; there is no guarantee youll have that in a public squad. Or anyone that generates might or other buffs, which is going to majorly affect the damage output of the entire group
---
For Ice Try what I did is I had him destroy all the pillars except one. He won't hide if you don't attack him/keep him near 100% health, so just gradually let him destroy the room. When there's only one pillar left start killing him and he'll only have one spot to teleport to, so just use a blink skill there.
---
The first one, yes. The current one is comparable in difficulty to a fractal boss due to it requiring actual coordination
---
I snorted loudly at this. Updoot.
---
No it's not. It barealy deals any damage, doesn't punish you for anything and dies in like 2 minutes. The only thing that can fuck you over is the enrage and it's pretty trivial to avoid.
---
Ehh, it depends on your screen size. I played initially on my 34" monitor and it was a cool effect, but hardly intrusive. Played again on my laptop and I could barely see a thing. I didn't find it annoying and thought it was a nice touch either way, but I could see how someone who's only option is a small screen could be bothered by it.

You seem to be equating "things happening in the story" with "explosions and action" when this isn't necessarily the case. Yes, **good** action movies (so, not Transformers) do use action scenes to further the story, but you don't need action for story to happen. And please, don't compare The Raven to Guild Wars 2; they're not in the same league.
---
Ultimately very little of interest happened. 90% of the episode is looking for a person who (predictably) is already dead. And for what? The entire episode just feels like a plot device to bring the player character north, but we already had a reason to go north with the whole Bangar situation. It feels like a pointless sidetrack that does nothing for the story that couldn't be achieved with more interesting means.

Thanks a bunch for this update.  I still haven't used a single one of my wardrobe unlocks, but I use this tool all the time to check what cheap skins I've not yet gotten for whatever reason.  Thanks again for your hard work.

Yeah I have Nvidia GeForce, but I can't find anything about how ReShade works in Nvidia, can you explain better? When I'm in the game I just press alt+f3?
---
thank you kind redditor!
---
All the asian MMORPGs that release there monthly are using Unreal. Guess it's just easy to use? No idea. But they all suffer from the same problem: once you have a higher amount of players in the same area it all goes to shit. Even worse than WvW zerg fights. The engine is just not optimized for that stuff. And they all look the same too.
---
How can I start getting the bag?
---
The problem is all the most impactful story beats are unwritten in the next section. And though they understand how loss and grief are powerful, the stakes are so high in every single episode that it takes the edge off.
---
SWTOR perhaps? There had been a TON of praise for the Agent and Knight storylines.
---
ReShade has always been a thing for GW2, particularly for skin mods. But it is also explicitly bannable in ANet's whatever, because you can use it to make PvP maps transparent. ANet did a SHARP 180 on the whole modding scene shortly after release, so be careful.
---
Man all these long posts, but all I want is a mount wheel that swaps grounded mounts without dismount.
---
If it was that way. My char got to 20 stacks yesterday and was just turned into an ice crystal, from which it broke out pretty quickly. So the frost effect is a big announcement for ... pretty much nothing.
---
Are you for real? They do not develop game anymore. They outright lie, like they did since PoF release... and many times before.
---
WvW restructure, fractals, raids all have been "on the table" for how long? New refocus on Guild Wars 2 should have been here since prologue... And as you can see last episode developed by Anet before layoffs was in May. Now we have true maintenance mode. They just either lie about another cut to the studio or they doing something else as they were after PoF.
---
When you think they're about to shill on bag runes and then they petition for acct bound bags
---
good guy redditor

if this is a petition for properly scaling mounts I'M IN
---
Because Rubi is not qualified to hold community management position, lol. Insulting your customer base is the best way to conduct business you know ;-)
---
People of other professions deal with toxic, abusive, disrespectful, etc people, hell there is special positions to deal with stuff like that. For example guest relations of any hotel deals with everything from food allergy to literal shit on the walls. Nobody died. But well... Anet is special snowflake, that nobody understands.
---
So we are back to dry top levels of development? When the only reason the game didnt die then because HoT was right around the corner...
---
Fucking hell
---
Doesn't seem to be limited. Normally if the purchase is limited, it doesn't let you to add stacks above the limit, here I can click up to at least 10 stacks (not sure above that, because I'm missing ice shards to pick more). I won't try to buy them and see if they somehow cap it at puchase, because I don't need that currency, but it seems to me that you're wrong.
---
i have guildies that click skills and dont use the mouse to turn the camera while walking. its like impossible to do any kind of content that has the slightest touch of a jp in it
---
u/that_shaman dug out [blue hero points icons](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1135474907465310208) and unless these were removed already, there might be still something on the way - either for elite specs or other uses, within Living World or Expansion, if there will be one.
---
Sure but is is cool . The ice crystal and all.i mean u killed bare hands a dragon u won't die from cold but better than a debuff to show the weather
---
The second one has the 32 slot sortable bags that you can craft with the ingots you get from it. Maybe ask around before you say something like that.
---
No dungeon boss is harder than strike missions, you like making stuff up?
---
Yes! I adore the new artwork! So crisp and beautiful.  It spices up the experience for me. Any idea who is the artist behind them?
---
Cool! Which preset do you use?
---
Just solo it.
---
Check out the collection for crafting the restored boreal weapons. Its in the story journal panel. You get the recipes from there
---
90 gold for 12 slot is too much. Most ppl would not care
---
Strike Mission takes like 5 mins to complete and can be done once a day/week only so adding a currency to it wouldn't make much sense.
---
&gt; I WANT HER
---
Oh, the fanart possibilities... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&gt; They announced that several days ahead of the patch.
---
Announced as "intended" or as "bug"?
---
worldbosses got feelings too
---
Ok, if you want to compare the speed of it, then you first need to include the time to get a squad for a strike, to actually get the gold rewards. Secondly, there are 6 chests available at all times which give you around 10-ish ingots. These 6 chests can all be claimed in waay less than 5 min. The meta, although a bit slower at around 10-15 min, but more afk-able gets you another 5-6 ingots (3 medium chests at the end). And lastly, the raven sanctum can be done in 3-5 min (or even less if you still have the blessing from the previous day) for another few ingots.
---
There was a jumpscare ?  
---
Where ? .\_.
---
Gotta love that .25s windup on their "instant down if it hits" attack.
---
Yes, let me find it for you
---
wait til christmas event and after that wait for the next 1-2 hours of story content.
---
Need a bookshelf for all that tomes x.x
---
Announced as "we're not expecting everyone to watch Guild Chats, but can people at least read patch notes?".
---
They keep the Public option only on "featured" Strike missions, aka the last ones released. Not sure if it was something planned from the get go to avoid using a new still-under-public-testing system on too many different strikes, but they said that most people didn't use the function on the first strike anymore so they were gonna remove it entirely. Makes sense, considering that lfg for strikes always filled quickly, while the public instances remained half empty for too long.
---
There is finite number of teams, if 3 teams work on living world, they can't work on expansion and vice versa.
---
Indeed. Blish going from calm voice at start to almost shaking from fear when Kralkatorrik got there was a huge emotional rollercoaster. Being alone (ok, with raptor) on your way home through an empty mist-cosmos-space made me fully focused on the robotic voice, every word coming from the Voice Actor. 
---
Although it's clearly Hollywood, it was exceptionally well done (unlike Balthazar plot).
---
i know the drill, just curious if anyone can tell me a reason to go back to the new map after 2 days of gameplay, honestly curious.
---
thanks, will give it a try later
---
I've accidentally blown my Outrage cooldown a few times on the aftercast because I thought I was stunned when I couldn't move or attack after using the hyperbeam.
---
Move on to other games
---
What makes you back to other maps?
---
Didn't even notice that lol.
---
Yup, this is new, and it's pretty major.
---
Not like the first strike . 12 slot is not as attractive as 70 gold drop item.
---
i enjoy the gameplay, i play other things like CMS, plus i wasn't offensive to you or told you what you should or should not do.
---
and i am not talking about the game, but about specifically the content that arenanet produces and trying to understand where is the replayability, where is the quality, the innovation and honestly the effort for the time it takes and all they left behind.
---
this game use to offer fractals and raids and legendaries with their patches, i am curious where any of that is, because it aint here on this one.
---
&gt; Being good at this game's combat system takes away all the strengths of it. 
---
The combat system IS the strength of the game. Oh my god...
---
Well said.
---
I don't think it needs to be it's own thing. At least merge the entrances in the raid lobby, and have it rewards its own unique currency. I'm a bit disappointed we don't have it already, but I'd imagine Anet will be adding it soon as more strike missions come out.
---
&gt; unlike Balthazar plot
---
You mean the "we've already killed off Abaddon but still want to write for him, oh well we'll just tell the story but change the name to Balthazar, should work right?" plot.
---
You claim Voice and Claw are easier than Icebrood Construct's Strike Mission and expect anyone to take you seriously?
---
The boss where you stand directly under it and avoid, without dodging, 90% of it's attacks was more difficult for you?
---
Doubt.
---
some where unique mechanics associated with them be it in fights or the map itself, for example drangonstand (fight), silverwastes (events), but most don't bring anything at all of new, although i feel like this one is the worst of all because not only it doesn't bring anything of interest its so bland so repetitive of things past, compare this for example to draconis moons, i spent a lot more time on that map, it had secrets and a collection that made you look in any little hole for a shard, a cool jumping puzzle, a meta that failed with a fight that had mechanics with the two wyverns and even the vine grappeling was fun.
---
And thats just top of my head.
---
&gt;  i am not talking about the game, but about specifically the content that arenanet produces
---
cool, cool
---
While i agree with some people here that already said about essences making to easy to skirt out combat,i feel that there is some potential to teach people. For instance, instead of being 3 beams that do damage, it could have been 1 support, 1 healing, and then 1 damage/cc. The support could have been a well type that you need to aim at players to teach them the importance of buffing people, the healing could have been some mass res/heal and the damage could been as it is now. It isn't much but they fit the roles the game needs for its hard content. The system needs a bit of fine tuning too since grabbing them now is really pointless and takes too long, last too little to be worth, i'm not going to some corner of the map to grab a 15min buff to kill mobs that already die too easy anyway. Either increase the stacks per orb, or make it last MUCH longer, like 2h until you exit.
---
As for the boneskinner and ice construct, the issue with those fights is that they lack zerg busting abilities. You mentioned HoT as the difficult point for most playerbase and while hot got a lot of things wrong too, it got many right. World bosses need attacks that NEEDs to be avoided, to feel threatening or it punish people, they can't be things that you just can sit there afking anyway without a shred of attention. The mordrem wyverns are perfect example of fights that punish zergs hard while not being so punishing to small groups, it scales very well. Boneskinner could have gotten an attack that makes him stronger if he consumes people and leave a pool of putrid damage that cause a lot of conditions, it teach people to cc him before he consume and to bring condi cleans.
---
Parts of the story are very good. But it's hard to say how much is completing it only because of the story and how much of it is completing content on alts. There's no good way to answer that for me.
---
Furthermore, I've never ever replayed a single player game just for the story. 
---
I"d say the story is uneven, with the personal story being my least favorite, followed by Season 2.  I really liked Season 3 and Season 4, and I'm liking the Ice Brood Saga so far.
---
It's sort of like your question is trying to prove the story isn't good, because people don't replay it just for the story.  That's a really weird metric to use.
---
In LFG you can join meta trains that run two or three times a day, 7:30pm UTC or 2:30am UTC. So a few hours before reset or 2.5 hours after reset.
---
always gold never failed, as for grothmar i have joined groups that couldnt do the 3 chests, plus the new one you can self heal just by not getting rooted on cleasing it and never move, on grothmar the tikking damage will kill people and the dodge mechanic (the big one that happens only on second phase will drop people under 80% (tikkinig damage will keep people at that level).
---
so when comparing a fight that look flashier but i never seen any one die to it (i understand i did it less times but i already killed it about 6 times), to one that normaly kills a couple of people that choose to stand on the boss and not jump on the plataforms to evade the wave on the second phase, yeah i would argue that grothmar is harder and less groups hit the 3 chests than the one in the new map.
---
but opinos aside one thing is obvious both of them are just to easy, its a quick join no strat one shot fights that you do as you do any other event or champ. at least it is to me.
---
Now the question is whether it's true.
---
Would it be possible to make other players invisible in places like that, if only for the duration of a scene?
---
We've seen this problem quite often where you can't see the NPC(s) you're interacting with in the open world due to crowds standing on top of them (especially when episodes are just released)
---
Do people really replay single player games purely for story that much though?
---
It probably is. Near where A Burden is found there's a spot where the special action skill Raven Lens becomes available and you can witness a vision of Asgeir sitting in front of a book with the Fang of the Serpent behind him; he gets up, hooks a chain to the tooth, and marches south, leaving the book behind.
---
So the book was written by Asgeir and left there by him.
---
Yes, I made a post about this earlier and for me this is like one of the biggest reveals of the episode and made me really question about Jormag true end game. A great read anyway!
---
you do see the question marks on the post ??? and you do understand that i am interested in knowing what is the replayability of the content.
---
it might be stockholm syndrome it might not, its not important for the question, i just would like to understand what is the replayability of the content, just that, and if you know please share.
---
I love the way Raid rewards work.  Every fight there is possible unique skin drop, but even if it doesn't you are slowly accumulating currency so you can buy whatever skin you want if you get don't get lucky on RNG.  Best of both worlds - chance to get lucky with a new skin, but if not it's ok because you're still noticeably working towards being able to buy it without needing RNG in your favor.
---
I would love for this system to be introduced to Strike missions.
---
Jormag's got a tighter grip on the norn as a whole than we suspected, and I can't help but wonder if there's gonna be more to this, all part of a bigger, hidden plan
---
Does this suggest that there never was a prophecy to break the tooth? It was all fabricated by Asgeir under the assumption that nobody could. Braham, having broken that assumption (excuse the pun), was never destined for anything in his fight against Jormag.
---
Lore is good, storytelling is very lousy. It has improved over the years though and the latest chapters actually gave me some emotional moments that I didn’t expect, but I wouldn’t recommend GW for the story. There are RPGs out there that are way better.
---
Just give them the wintersday raptor treatment, scarf, earmuffs, and everything
---
I've seen way more people drop in Voice and Claw than I've ever seen on Icebrood. If people died on Icebrood it was because they refused to teleport to shrine and died in the jumping puzzle, and thus couldn't be rezzed midfight. Again, 90% of Icebrood's damage can be avoided by simply standing directly under it's model. Pop Aegis now and then, AoE healing, tada, ez chests.
---
Again, I seriously doubt your claim here. You have some valid criticisms, sure, but you're mixing in absolute bull just to extend your post. Maybe just...move on to another game for a little while dude. It's okay to put the game down and take a break.
---
This is the dumbest thing i have seen in a long while good job OP  
---
and i dont even care about the story at all
---
Who's "her" here ?
---
A good story does not mandate replayability. In GW2 there is little to no branching (past the personal story) and no variable outcome. The game tells a very linear story as apposed to traditional single player RPGs like the elder scrolls series, or Witcher which provide a potentially very different experience every playthrough due to the sheer amount of side quests. These are just different ways of storytelling of which neither is clearly superior.
---
It makes perfect sense, honestly. If I'm a dragon and some humans attack me, I'll going to kill them to **survive**. But if they don't attack me, okay, continue with your lives, I won't chase you.
---
Actually, you can talk to an old born near the tooth (can't remember if it is only is a LS or not) who tells you that it's really more of a child's tale.
---
I like how you captured the game's art style!
---
Oh sorry, didn't realise this had already been posted so I give credit where it's due

---
Wait are you implying that there's anything rewarding about the story as far as gold and other stuff, even the first time around? Usually rewards are quite shit aside from map access which typically only needs the first instance. 
---
I don't replay through the entire story repeatedly because I usually pay attention the first time, unless there's a new tidbit they add for doing it on different characters (e.g. I redid HoT story because Sylvari have a different experience and my first play through was on a human). I do go back and watch cinematics on youtube or playthroughs that I really enjoyed from time to time though if I want to look at story again.
---
I'm sorry but this is a really stupid way to frame whether a story is good or not. Not everybody rereads the same great book repeatedly or watches a classic excellent film repeatedly.
---
They would actually need to work on stuff and it seems that it is not the way anet does things these days

---
A good story is not necessarily a story which you can replay a lot. This is especially true for GW2 since, as a MMO, they don't give you a lot of meaningful choices in order to make sure the same things are canon for all the players. 
---
I did replay several chapters either to experience the small changes based on the races or choices you make, to explore different paths and to check some of the dialogs again. But I don't have a lot of incentive to replay it a lot, maybe 3/4 times for the parts I liked the most.
---
There are several single players games I played through like a dozen times or more: the Baldur's Gate series, the Mass Effect series, Dragon Age, Planescape Torment etc. All because they all offered impactful choices that changed the outcome of the story in one way or the other.

I go back because it's new (therefore not worn out yet though like all things it will inevitably get there), I'm enjoying the short but sweet mini "boss rush" after the meta, I've been getting decent drops from enemies, farming Snow Truffles and some Platinum, playing the Strike for daily rewards.
---
I've also gone to other maps in the past couple days, such as running my boyfriend's new Guardian around the Crystal Desert to get it HPs and taking part in those metas for daily Amalgamated Gemstones, daily farming in Bitterfrost, WvW, and achievement hunting.
---
But none of that will inform for you things to do, sorry. You feel you've burnt through everything worthwhile to do on the new map, then for you, you have. Play other content elsewhere in the game, or give it a rest and play another game. You're burnt out, and yes that is a valid answer to your complaints here.
---
Thanks for keeping this updated, much appreciated
---
also there is no season currency (like volatile or unbound magic)
---
Tbf they could have made pvp into an Esport. Ranked team queues in high Elo could have been kept and support for monthly tournaments could have stayed, but it wasn’t a priority anymore for some reason. Even though the combat system is great for pvp and regular balance patches for that game mode would have kept it healthy.
---
NICE PLEASE TAKE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
---
Braham D:
---
Braham :)
---
The story is full of examples of the Commander doing something stupid and succeding just because of plot armor.
---
We dont need more of that.
---
You cant write a good story if you know the hero cant fail. Pretending that they can only makes it worse because you'll always bail them out with plot armor.
---
Sons of Svanir probably stole them after they killed the rider. And raptors are probably the easiest/cheapest mount to get in-lore and most of the npcs that have mounts have raptors, because the rest of the mounts are uncommon/expensive.
---
I don't think so. They went with a sagas-only model because they were likely planning to have a major new game to replace GW2 by now, and that clearly didn't work out for them. Sagas would be their way to continue supporting and expanding GW2 at a lower budget, much in the same way as they did with GW1 while 2 was in development. LS5 is in every way smaller than what LS4 was (which, by itself, was already in development during a time when Anet was taking resources away from the game), and there's no expansions in sight nor any larger, ambitious system revamps/ additions. Instead, most features you've seen added are minimal in scope: build templates, 100 levels added to crafting stations with a few sidequests attached to, etc.
---
It's possible that, by now, Anet has changed plans and decided to focus more on GW2, building on larger stuff in the background. But there's no signs of that.
---
its not stupid, just a different priority than u might have
---
Why shouldn't I compare speed? All of these methods are easy and the strike mission is the most time efficient even if you account for 1-4 more mins to make a group (which you can use to hunt for the chests you are talking about). This discussion started because you said that the strike mission doesn't give you enough bars for your efforts, whis is false.
---
Anet is still working on side-projects.
---
I'm guessing we'll keep getting karma as currency, which isn't too bad overall, makes farming for older things easier.
---
I'd love to get those map-wide karma boosters like those in S3 and S4 though.
---
except the Commander answered "Right" after Braham asked if we are not going to take Jormag's words seriously. So no, we aren't falling into anything, but someone with a weak mind is, maybe Marjory that showed she has some problems with handling the whispers.
---
Except voice acting clearly indicated commander has doubts.
---
That's what I expected ;)
---
Makes sense to limit public matchmaking to only current rotation. Getting 5 people in was basically impossible in certain timeslots already.
---
One of the projects was a mobile, but no way all of them were.
---
A mobile game would never replace a mmo, and GW2 was clearly being managed under the assumption that it would be replaced by something else.
---
join a a random public squad, see how that works out for you.
---
i do play both of them, they are by far the best part of the game in my opinion, but thats no the question here.
---
the questions simple, what is the replayability of the content arenanet is adding to the game?
---
I couldn't really understand what she was saying sorry :•(
---
We have karma this episode. I do t mind really, wintersday is almost here too.
---
It's not a conspiracy theory. It's inside infp corroborated by various sources, including ex-ANet developers and gaming journalists, and has had very clear consequences on this game's content release. If Anet still had around 210+ people working on GW2 like they did during Hot/ PoF, we would have had a third expansion released by now, with 9 new elite specs, a massive new expansion-worthy feature, significantly better pvp/ wvw/ raid/ fractal development in addition to their current living world candence. Well, where's all that?
---
That Anet's PR speak is intentionally vague does not means that everything is okay. Quite the contrary. That's just damage control.
---
I've been floating around 2-3k ping for a couple of weeks so I'm taking a break now. I will say though that the day after the last update was pretty good.
---
It's funny because you're 100% right, this subreddit is in some hard core denial
---
"All is pain. Aurene wants to end it. I can help her. I want to help her."
---
Text displayed in the video is the parts where supposedly the Fraenir himself is speaking
---
Thank you for your kind words! You rock!
---
[deleted]
---
A human commander says umh... Right so there is some doubt there aswell
---
I'm guessing Jormag lied to Asgeir for its own survival. Just go into their heads, use the voice they like and say what they wanna hear.
---
Then again, Jormag is literally telling the commander "KILL THEM" through telepathy, so the Commander would be real foolish to think of Jormag as a friend. Voice acting might have also just indicated fatigue/confused especially with all that mind persuasion.
---
Does anyone know why I can't pick up vm with my skyscale in Dragonfall? They disappeared from the map so I can't complete How to Feed your Skyscale. Is there a limit to gathering them on a map?
---
Damage wise yes but with scepter you generate more clones for more quickness. Feel free to take Sword with the Duelling spec.
---
Ehe I promise I will work on my English. Hope I will soon be able to make Cambridge CEA.
---
The game already has way too many currencies. Apart from Obsidian Shards, karma has not been relevant since the dungeon days.
---
I am not sure if my provider of working schema allows this. I have to look for some information about it.
---
No, not stupid at all.  Selling the weapons now while the price is high is the smart move, if you like gold.  In a week or two when the price comes down, then consider saving the Eitrite.  
---
On an side note, has future ascended boreal weapons been announced or is that just conjecture?
---
Thank you!
---
I though it is a bug that it resets daily.
---
You want a motivation to grind?
---
I do understand but you know. When I use it public it would be shame to don't own originals.
---
Glad to help :D.
---
Thank you Loco my biggest fan!
---
Thanks Captain!
---
What I said was no good drops ASIDE from ingots
---
How do they even obtain raptors that far North?
---
The key difference between expansion and lws so far as been that the expansions come with a new feature (gliding for HoT and mounts for PoF) and elite specs. Since that is the difference so far i would assume we would get them in the saga too, just rolled out over episodes instead of all at the same time.
---
Let's hope we do, fingers crossed, but this episode was so underwhelming that my expectations are very low.
---
Already saw it fail once, the blizzard will stay the whole time, kinda anoyying to do things in the map then, asked immediately to some guildies if I could taxi to a map that didn't fail
---
Yeah, open world's age is showing and it definitely can't be sustained much longer, even with a band-aid fix like a cure for illness.
---
Same, I'm at 14 characters with several of them having maxed inventories. Maxed all bank tabs and got more shared slots than I need at the moment. 
---
Still, I find several legitimate uses for 32 slot bags. If you don't, that's fine, but that doesn't make them useless or a waste of money.
---
to be honest i prefer karma rather than an specific currency. Karma has a more broad usage and you can spend it for gold the same as any other currenc y.
---
To keep playing at least. No currency or unique rewards just means another lost reason to play the content.
---
No, my problem was with you saying that ingots are easier to get outside of strike missions, don't move the goalpost.
---
&gt; achievement points 
---
&gt; earn Eitrite to make the new weapons and sell them on the TP while they are the hot item
---
&gt; Help friends and guildees get their achievements on the map
---
Yeah, the 3 developers left definitely can.
---
VI VON ZULUL
---
Easily obtained outside, not easier. Not trying to nitpick too much, just standing by what i wrote. They are worth the effort if you really need them, otherwise the strikes dont offer anything you'd ever want
---
I would prefer it if she were truthful. This would put a new perspective on elder dragons, her svanir and consecutively the commander.
---
If the commander tries to kill another elder dragon then that would suddenly make them the villain and who does not love to play a misguided hero?
---
In terms of devs reacting to constructive feedback? Not much good happened. Most of it was mocked, ignored, deleted or put on a table.
---
&gt; with a tiny map
---
If we get the second half of the map/story twice as early, it wouldn't be different from the previous releases. But what's better as far as pure perception of content cadence goes, now that we already moved away from Dry Top to LS3-4, is a serious question.
---
Or it shows that Jormag has a larger plan. Allowing the Norn to survive did bolster his army via the sons of svanir.
---
After mordremoth, our characters started to realize the original thought that the dragons were basically just absentminded storms rolling through the world, was wrong.  Were starting to see and interact with dragons directly now and see that they're very much conscious, thinking entities.
---
How dare you?! 
---
:P
---
So when they expand the map no new map completion rewards. Kinda sucks as there are less chances for keys :(
---
According to Kralkatorrik himself before his death, he mentions a "Mother", so somebody or something DID create them or, at the very least, they have some sort of motherly figure.
---
Was probably the svanir stumbling out of the room
---
Other that obsidian, are there many main stream uses (I consider purchasing all the minis in the game from vendors a niche use, at least until they tie AP to that) for karma for vet players?  I used to run the daily pact supply masters for the mapping supplies and turn them in for tier 6 mats, but have fallen out of that habit due to burnout.    
---
What makes "Bringing karma back into the game is a good thing"?  Thanks in advance for your insight.
---
If you only play for rewards I can recommend virtual slot machines.
---
&gt; open world's age is showing
---
Another ground-breaking approach - similar to PoF's mounts and HoT's gliding+movement masteries - would've gone a long way. Like, say, underwater mounts and underwater maps with reworked underwater combat. But as of now, the new masteries are just more of tacked-on unexciting gimmicks, and the season doesn't even have a universal farmable currency like the previous ones.
---
The dragons are part of this world and wakes up to purge the excess of magic on Tyria, seeing them starting to feel bad or remorseful even is just contradictory to years of setup for gw2, just feels strange to make such a U-turn
---
Would be some really sucky storytelling if they simply treated Jormag like Ice Mordremoth.
---
&gt;as if an elder dragon has ever been presented as a sentient being capable of compassion
---
coughAURENEcough
---
This doesn't contradict anything, consuming magic and killing the norn don't have to go hand in hand here. You can feel bad about a race you come to respect the strength of and feel compassion for needlessly throwing thier lives away at you and tell them to leave and also still do your job consuming magic without killing them.
---
Wonder if we'll get a [Tauntaun skin](https://i.imgur.com/YnDZssF.png) for the raptors...
---
I've never seen it mocked and some game modes have been neglected, like WvW, but ultimately changes happen because devs feel they are a goid change based on numbers and stuff. I got a change put in for a necromancer skill by showing how the old design didn't fall in line with rest of the weapon skills and offered an alternative. I got a bad design of a PvP map fixed by providing video evidence of how bad it was. Wording it nice won't always work but doing a Gordon Ramsey will never work. Attacking other players for having a difference will absolutely never work.
---
Its really sad when people who lack any sort of meaning in real life attach their identity and sense of purpose to a game and proceed to perceive any sort of criticism or attack on the game as criticism or attack on themselves.
---
I hope you manage to get better, I cannot imagine having a life so vapid my only identity becomes based on a shitty mmo.
---
Old ANet wouldn't be able to do it either. Full combat rework for underwater is too huge of a risk, so many mechanics they could not reuse or have to completely redesign, super dumb idea overall. Unless they make underwater exactly like land, it aint gonna work.
---
No, I can't imagine feeling bad or even getting angry because of that.
---
I played another MMO for quite a long time way before GW2 (10+ years) whose developers promised quite often and quite a lot of things that never came to be or were simply oversold. I could've chosen to be angry, to be upset but I didn't because I understand that reality is often quite different due to several factors.  
---
In time, an expansion was released. I played for all of two days of that expansion then quit for good.
---
I had no remorse in doing so or any strong feelings towards anyone or anything. I most certainly didn't turn vicious towards the developers because I wasn't given what I wanted. I simply understood the game was no longer to my liking so I looked elsewhere and considering there's a myriad of games, that's hardly a challenge.
---
Being attached to something this fleeting is never a wise choice. Attachment of any kind usually leads only to suffering and quite evidently so in the case of this subset of GW2 players who are no longer being catered to. 
---
I think they also forgot what games are meant to be first and foremost - entertainment. 
---
So, if you're not having fun, it's high time to look elsewhere as you'll only dig yourself deeper into this bog of hate should you remain. It's neither healthy for yourself nor anyone else involved.
---
That being said, I don't require new content to play a game, GW2 in this case, as I always find my own way to have fun. It'd require a complete overhaul like in the MMO I mentioned earlier for me to quit and then only if that overhaul changes things for the worse in my view.
---
I get that everyone likes to make fan of dumb fanboys but some of them are genuinely mentally disturbed and suffer from this identity crisis.
---
I sincirely hope you manage to get better and seperate your personal worth from this shitty mmo. You will be much much happier for it when you do and finally find a meaningful identity.
---
He never stated when it will be needed.
---
But he literally said that we need the extra power.
---
Anet doesnt have good track record on this kind of things.
---
Then you're still wrong.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing
---
**Anti-aliasing**
---
Anti-aliasing may refer to any of a number of techniques to combat the problems of aliasing in a sampled signal such as a digital image or digital audio recording.
---
Specific topics in anti-aliasing include:
---
Anti-aliasing filter, a filter used before a signal sampler, to restrict the bandwidth of a signal such as in audio applications
---
Spatial anti-aliasing, the technique of minimizing aliasing when representing a high-resolution image at a lower resolution
---
Fast approximate anti-aliasing, an anti-aliasing algorithm created by Timothy Lottes under NVIDIA. May also be referred to as Fast Sample Anti-aliasing (FSAA).
---
Well you see the whole Jora/svanir thing happen in gw1, the pc is present and actively helps her defeat him, so it's more than just a story.
---
The price is going to plummet, it's not a stupid move it's a smart one. Basically the price is high only because of the time gate and the new LW has created a strong demand for those who are impatient. In a few weeks to a month the cost of buying the weapons will be a small increase vs crafting only because of time gated mats as supply will be constant (profit involved) and demand will plummet as soon as the majority get it done. You can craft now and sell, wait a month or 2 and buy them up completing the achievement with a fairly good profit to boot if you simply can wait.
---
Instead of grind, lets say:   
---
A reason to stop for events when im passing them, instead of rushing through and getting dailies, frost shards and chests, because 150 karma is just very meh.
---
Jormag is evil! They killed Owl!
---
Huh I had no idea that was in the first game. I played it but must have missed that bit. Theory partially still stands - Jormag let the norn live to take advantage of them.
---
Patch notes indicate the featured strike wih public mode is only the latest one
---
&gt;(On a side note: Anet, pls revamp the overworld Boneskinner. It needs the pomp and glamour it rightfully deserves.)
---
As long as they make the rewards not suck as well. Killing it doesn't even give that useless eternal ice map currency.
---
They have the same amount of employees as any other MMO team. What you're excusing is shitty time management.
---
To late my friend, i sold 5 boreal weapon at 150g the first day... now isnt worth sell it
---
&gt;What do you do now? Use only masterworks gear, 5 different runes and pick random traits, never dodging and always auto attacking?
---
I still use my Ascended Marauders, Grieving, Viper, or Celestial gear, but I run with traits and skills I find fun and weapons that don't necessarily synergize, but I enjoy the independent skillsets of. Like Ranger Greatsword and Shortbow until they took away the Greatsword's dodge and throw. And if I want to run full signets because I like what the signets do, I'll run full signets. 
---
The "never dodge, only autoattack" crowd is a myth. But skills are more fun to use as situational tools than as a static rotation.
---
What if Jormag is motivated by raising an army to confront Primordus? We know both dragons are at odds. And why else is Icebrood Saga logo blue and red? 
---
Jormag probably sees Icebrood as necessary to protect their followers.
---
Hi Clayton, 
---
I have yet to play the release myself, but I want to thank you for coming here and voicing your thoughts on the matter, as well as defining the intent and target demographic for what you introduced. :) It's probably not what some players want to hear, but it's also not something as grim as being "an excuse to not learn to play".
---
Whereas the subreddit often sports very dedicated and skillful players that make incredibly informed choices and stick to the very high end of what is possible, the average open world player - or really any player who simply wants to be creative, wonky and off-meta with their open world build in The Icebrood Saga - will hopefully really profit from this system in the months to come and enjoy the extra power! 
---
And the nature of those masteries being bound to a specific part of the world may mean that the masteries are less universal, but it also means that they absolutely do not invalidate any pre-existing challenging content. It would of course still be nice if the masteries mattered on several maps to come, not just this one, but I am optimistic about that! 
---
I will come back here and add some more informed insight once I have played the episode. :)
---
Sure, I’d would feel
---
finally, someone draws a gw2 character in a way that makes them look truly bad-ass. he looks so ready to fuck shit up. 10/10
---
What makes you say it's incoherent?
---
It's always been about the Elder Dragons and still is.
---
I honestly believe this map's potential isn't shown yet and the boneskinner will have more to show on the strike mission and on the next part of the map.
---
No one has ever said it's too hard. You can literally autoattack the entire time and clear it.
---
The reality is we do not know. Some projects were probably only in the concept stages.
---
As for GW - lorewise it would be really tough to make a sequel considering we are already in the renaissance and prequels are always problematic. Sure you have the actual guild wars era or you could make a technomagic future sequel like Phantasy Star but working with tons of established lore presents its own problems.
---
If there was one thing i d love ANET to do is make NC dust off City of Heroes and let them at it.
---
Because its too easy to have a good reward. You just put your brain in afk mode and wait for this poor kodan to die 🤷‍♂️ 
---
not against having loot added but only if they add difficulty to it
---
Ahhh.. I wish we had an ult that visually used all of our pets like this.
---
But then the earned items have no monetary value. MMO players have some weird psychological need to show things off and feel better than others and they can't do that if what they earned has no value to anyone. It is the driving force behind the Pinata/Garrent/Vinewrath events.
---
I mean Jormag was literally leading people out of the Jhora's keep to freeze to death or be eaten by the wendigo the entire time. You can even talk to them as they're talking to Jormag. (You can't stop them from walking and sitting down in the snow and gradually freezing to death though.)
---
Unless you get decimated because you dont cc.
---
There is already evidence that Jormag is a filthy liar throughout the entire zone.
---
Jormag being slow and methodical won't change the fact it's just another Dragon trying to manipulate everyone, only replacing the Sylvari with Norn.
---
Which btw, if the point so far seems to be the Norn, why did we even HAVE the whole thing with the Charr? Was that done solely because ANet couldn't think of a Norn villain?
---
She is just misunderstood obviously
---
I genuinely hope that that is the case.  
---
I would love to see Bright-Shore turn into a legendary Boneskinner in the Strike Mission. That would be a nice carryover from the story.
---
If we have to wait for the next episode and the next strike, then this map's potential failed hard.
---
I wonder what would happen if you left a character there when the second episode releases.
---
No Tom Abernathy who is the studio narrative director pointed that Mike Z mentioned this in the saga announcement.
---
Please keep using this art style, I love that it's so detailed!
---
And icy Great old one as opposed to  plant invasion of the body snatchers
---
it was something revealed officially just yesterday: more things in between at the cost of shorter episodes, but more frequent.
---
- I choose openworld.
---
- Raids die.
---
- literally who?
---
Much ppl enjoy fractals, raids, gliders, mounts and some specs.
---
I think you are not alone, but very much ppl like the changes.
---
Where can I find this ingame to read?
---
There is a right choice, raids.
---
This story predates that tho, which means Jormag had a "Voice" long before mordy died. 
---
I think it's more likely that they just choose not to speak or felt it was unnecessary.
---
Outside of cosmetics, the new 32 slot bag from the Bjorra requires less supreme runes of holding to craft, at the trade off of requiring several days worth of eitrite ingots per finished bag and some eternal ice.
---
Not to mention you can't just take a bunch of PC devs and tell them to make mobile games.
---
SWTOR has a lot of good stories, though unfortunately a lot of it is locked behind purchases/expansions/DLCs.
---
The Secret World also has very good writing, amazing voice acting and a really unique horror/lovecraftian vibe all around. 
---
I'd say top tier storytelling would be FFXIV, from the first expansion and on. ARR (the base game)'s story is pretty generic and slow, but the second you step into Heavensward (the first expansion) the story is top-notch, and the story of the latest expansion (Shadowbringers) could most definitely compare and even surpass the writing of a lot of single-player FF games we've gotten in the last few years. Of course, FF has a sub fee, so you gotta weight that as well.
---
It's prerecorded, just like the Rytlock-Bangar encounter, so players can't be there.
---
&gt; If anyone truly believes that content releases will significantly go up even when ANet has confirmed they're not working on anything substantial like elite specs, new instanced content, etc. I admire the amount of hope they have left for the game.
---
From the current team in the near future, I realistically expect the same amount of maps and story over the same period of time, but without fractals/raids/other major updates like elite specs.
---
That toughness check mechanics is horrible anyways.
---
They should replace it with other method, like entering a circle that makes the enemy lock on you after standing there for more than 1s.
---
&gt; reasonable ammount of toughness on tank if there are no toughness boosting classes in sqaud.
---
More terrible in the implementation of the episode I have not seen. It is obvious that it was created on the knee... Mobs specifically have made strong, to justify system of masteries. A bunch of bugs, starting with broken trowels, ending with mechanics. The map is smaller than all the others. The story is completely emotionless. At that moment, when I just started to get emotions from the passage, I was informed that the episode was over.
---
Something to the effect of "They'll write more songs about you. Keep your legend alive."
---
Especially nice since it acknowledges your character has been to the concert in the prologue.:) Other races just say "I'll find whoever did this, I promise."
---
It seems more that they're treating Jormag like a seducer. Just seduces you with sweet words and good feelings to make you its willing slave.
---
Our legends must be lies.
---
True scholars know the true enemy are the story instances, and I'm pretty happy to see them get less and less attention. Too bad everything else has lost resources as well :I.
---
now i'm curious what specific event inspired you to make this PSA
---
The MMO genre is absolutely not dead. Literally all it means is "Massively Multiplayer Online" which... almost every game is these days! Consider games like Fortnite, Destiny, Elite, even something like Red Dead Online. These games are either already MMOs or could become one with minimal adjustments, and GW2 already has the right business model. Considering that GW1 was not a traditional MMO either, it's entirely possible that GW3 wouldn't have been either.
---
Honestly a better build than what you posted would be sword/shield holo running hard light arena. Better boon output, twice as much damage, and still plenty of CC considering you barely need it.
---
I’ll believe it when I see it.
---
No, the toughness check mechanic is good, otherwise we would have people in their exotic soldiers gear crying that they cant kill the boss before the enrage timer
---
So GW2's exploitative tactic is to... make the game enjoyable? That's literally how games SHOULD be designed. 
---
The kind of games referenced in that talk explicitely put those hits of dopamine behind paywalls, they specifically restrict the ability of players to progress in the game to force them to pay to do so instead.
---
GW2 does literally the opposite - content requires minimal skill to ensure that as many people can play it as possible (not to mention that there's no way to pay to progress).
---
Yeah I have. And the Bearbow ranger still uses every skill on the longbow skillbar, especially Point Blank Shot. and the Necro is still laying down all the marks, sometimes getting a few combos off.
---
"Uses suboptimal weapons and skills" =/= "Auto-attack only".
---
I just puked this is why new raids are so easy. Please stop insisting content needs to be easily doable with fuckin soldiers gear and stick to ur t1 fracts
---
That would be pretty interesting to see, especially how making taunt available to more classes would trickle out to competitive modes. Nice idea
---
ah many were from first time completition, I thought it was daily'able ! thanks
---
I never said that, you are the one saying it and acting as if I said it.
---
And the fact that you are assuming I said that speaks a lot more for yourself than you are speaking for me.
---
Yes? Never said it's "good" for anyone from either camp, just "realistic".
---
They said that if it appears in later eps depends not on Clayton Kisko, but on different teams (I guess the teams that work on the next episodes?)
---
Well done!
---
This. Don't forget the awesome cinematic at the end of season 4.
---
They can clearly do this with our character in them. They should do it. every. time. It's the story of the commander after all.
---
r/ComedyCemetery
---
jep, and in the squad version you could already start the jumping puzzle while waiting for players
---
"No toughness check" is a path of logic that leads to "i should not be considered as hurting the group if i run toughness" which in turn heads through "full soldiers should be okay" clear to "why cant i complete content in soldiers gear" to land at "content should be completable in soldiers gear"
---
On the contrary.
---
You can bring the same berserker gear for all dungeons, all fractals and pretty much anywhere.
---
Then you go into raids and someone has to equip a freaking infusion with +5 toughness or use some different food to have the boss act in a different way.  
---
The mechanics in the boss fight and how player react to them is what should make the boss act in a different way, not what skills, traits, upgrades or stats players bring along. 
---
What if nobody brought any of the first time along? Now someone has to leave the instance and get some different gear and come back.  
---
Any mechanic that will require players to leave the instance to adjust their builds unless they have legendary gear or currency to buy something off a vendor inside the instance is not a good mechanic.
---
&gt; From Anet's business perspective there is obviously a right choice. If Anet had to completely remove open world or raids, what do you think they will remove? Bingo, raids.
---
So, you assumed the message and then decided to shoot the messenger?
---
not a glitch it's an extra feature for you from EAnet, have fun \^\^
---
They don't know where to go since after personal story. They write stuff as they go and I think that's a major problem and it has been plaguing GW2 since then. They improved a lot of stuff, sure, but they really need to plan ahead.
---
I'm still surprised the mastery system is still used. Still wish they made more meaningful masteries, though.
---
Parent company(runs the other game which lots of people still like) sweeps the game developer(that had bigger staff than wow and delivered nothing) claiming countless victims.
---
 /popcorn
---
They were talking about the Essence manipulation mastery, not about story/other masteries in this case though.
---
maybe give some more info? like when you last updated it?
---
based on the info given i can only suggest for you to try and turn it off and on again, the equivalent of which in this is would be what squid smuggler suggested.
---
I wonder if the reasons why we think it's Jormag are because:
---
1. It's the same voice from the trailer.
---
2. Jormag is mentioned to do it.
---
3. Jormag flatout talks to us at the end.
---
4. The POINT OF THE TRAILER is that Jormag does it.
---
5. The journal we find shows Aegir Dragonrender describe JORMAG'S voice in the same way.
---
Or who knows, maybe all the evidence being shown SINCE THE TRAILERS is wrong and the few random people who somehow think it's someone else are right.
---
This is true now, theres been kills with people naked, no weapons, solo kills, 2-6 man kills, people in greens killing bosses etc.  
---
"Then why do people require you to..."  
---
Because 99% of the playerbase couldn't do that, at all. It's possible, but you are headed into an instance with 9 others you need to respect their time by bringing knowledge and a build that compliments the team and you need to haul your own weight. If it's your guild and you want to try a naked VG run that's fine as long as everyone agrees to it.
---
&gt;Mordremoth was actually Jungle Jormag, not the other way around.
---
And which one appeared in the game first?
---
Mordremoth. Meaning that, in the game \[you know, that thing that matters FAR MORE than a book\], he did it first and ANet seems to just be doing the same thing for Jormag.
---
So its my first time installing the add on, and i installed the latest version of it.
---
A longbow ranger? I see you're a man of culture as well; whenever I ask for advice about long ranged classes the meta players jump on my back about it. :p
---
Thanks for your hard work! I just wanted to let you know that the thumbnail you have for the map showing the loacations of all the chests for essence looter doesn't link to a larger viewable version of itself unlike all your other maps.   
---
Also as a suggestion it'd be really nice to have a map combining all the chests (regular and essence) for ease of use collecting all the loot every day.
---
Actually the book was written before the game and the whole dungeon storyline is based off of it.
---
This reminded me! The vigil guy that handles the same event after you've played story has some very strong opinions about what is and isnt real necromancy. He's deeply offended at the ritual and I liked the touch of his perspective.
---
&gt; city
---
&gt; fighting a boss
---
what are these exactly?
---
And being the one that goes to the boss and kicks their shin and yells something nasty about their mom is a better way to do that that having the boss set up a freaking coat room at the door, taking your clothes and the entrance, and then having a meeting with his adds to decide who gets to be the target after reading all the labels in everyone's clothes.
---
Keep most settings higher, put char model limit to low, and quality to medium. You wont get much higher fps since gw2 is very single core heavy. And you chose cpu with mode cores at lower single core performance.
---
Just to the dalie the daly cap of those events, the once that gives u those ice shards and leave the map. That's what I do, cause the map is to small and to boring to stay in it to long, I just go in do everything that gives me shards and then leave, and u forget the cheep amulet u can get in this map, salvaging it u have a chance of a rear drop that is worth 500g now, so I would say u're just doing the wrong grind mate, grind for shards not for curency \^\^
---
Yep, definitely a feature. 👍
---
Damn, now I want to abandon my other characters and play more Ranger. Great art :D
---
But they tried to give us one and failed in that so we got neither, not really.
---
No raid content and no worthwhile open world content.
---
So basically the exact same story of Mordremoth and the Sylvari? Sounds kinda lazy to me.
---
I should have been more specific... what most people refer to as the classical MMORPG with a persistant world. Even so the mobile market share dwarfs anything else and for investors looking at NCsofts portfolio the question wouldnt be MMO/CRPG... but rather: "Is it on mobile?".
---
Alas as i said it is not so much the game type but more the lore problem that makes GW3 a very difficult if not outright impossible endeavor.
---
Then again you have "sequels" like Overwatch 2 now...
---
Doesn't that imply that a single team is making both Episode 1 and 2?
---
Feels like it's just one episode broken into two parts.
---
I don't like MMORPG's, the story is the only reason why I'm playing GW2.....  
---
And also because it's "free"
---
Local games seller get the biggest cut on **2nd hand sales only.**   
---
Brand new stuff brings in new customers, but the profit is minimal; used products keep them coming back. Now, I'm not pulling that out of my ass, I have a good buddy who owns a video-game shop. According to him, he earns way more selling a 2nd hand PS2 game than a brand new console.
---
And then what? Where do you go after this pyrrhic victory?
---
Plottwist: Dwayna is Jormag
---
kill both and sell the kingdom to highest bidder! (the gemshop path)
---
I m currently enjoying it on the Homecoming servers.
---
A bit old and wonky sometimes but still a ton of fun.
---
... the comment clearly states “pleasing everyone is near impossible.”
---
&gt; Open World dies and gets replaced by..
---
...a mess of new one-off gimmicky systems and modes that lose support one episode after release.
---
I agree the release cadence for raids and fractals have been awfully slow, and teams have been shuffled around. 
---
But I think ArenaNet are also aware of how low player engagement Raids have fractals have atm, and they are aware of the huge skill gap between the community that engage in end game content like fractals and raids, and those that don’t. Pushing out raids that only a fraction of the player base will interact with, doesn’t make Anet a lot of money. 
---
Strike missions serve to a introduce casual players to core game mechanics, and prepare them for the (already existing) end game content. Just because there hasn’t been released a lot of raids or fractals recently, doesn’t mean they’re not the main endgame content anymore. I wouldn’t be surprised if Anet made more raids if they see more players engaging with raid content. This leads back to the point about strike missions being a stepping stone between open world content and end game content. 
---
When the gap between open world content and end game content becomes so big that players aren’t able to make the leap, you need a system that bridges that gap, hence; strike missions. 
---
I’m not sure strike missions are the sole future of PvE end game content. I think it’s an introductory system, and raid and fractal development might be on pause until the strike mission system is “completed”. 
---
However, if strike missions turns out to be the new end game content, and the difficulty of strike missions becomes equal to that of raid bosses, I would be totally in favor of adding a different reward system. It’s just with the laughable difficulty of strike missions so far, I’m surprised they even offer rewards at all.
---
You didnt see any of that through the whole 2 expansions. And suddenly belindaaa belindaaaa. Like srsly that was pretty out of place. And she's a fucking necromancer to begin with. Dead people are her specialty.
---
Try contacting the support.
---
Chelsea, you witch! I've got a bleed on the brain because of you!
---
I don’t think this is a realistic train of thought. It requires external reading and connecting that other skills specifically have a knockback trait, or even reading in depth the mastery skill effect. Your average player is not doing that. 
---
Hell I had a guildie join my group for a strike last night and he had no actual build, no masteries completed, no understanding of the fight, and he died almost immediately. I guarantee you that just taught him “I don’t get these strike missions. this is not my thing”
---
Because that is what he told me as he lay there dead.
---
idk if it's important that Tom Abernathy said "What our goal is every time players log in, there's something new for them to do. And they are getting more fun and value on a more regular basis, not having to wait so long for a big drop basically" and then Clayton Kisko said "Yeah and to just piggyback from you here, describing what you said events, we have the strike missions that are coming out, the fraenir that is coming out, boneskin of the fallen. I've been kinda hush hush, but we have little tiny propr changes, little tiny dialogue addition, as the weeks roll out. Keep and eye for that." 
---
If they can add new dialogue and props........is it crazy to maybe assume they could add a character with new dialogue, or way more ambitious a little new event or two between releases?
---
As cool as this is it's confusing to me. Why would you take on this massive burden to protect your entire race, keep it a secret forever, make sure absolutely no one will ever ever ever find out, take it with you to the grave no matter what and WRITE IT DOWN IN A BOOK.
---
Those people have no place in pug raids
---
Is it not excessive to start accusing ANet of being aggressive liars?
---
That's way too familiar to be called a stranger
---
Well this is for essence manipulation specifically. I don't think that really entails other plans aren't in place. They supposedly already have other teams working on stuff past ep2.
---
He actually asks for fruit only. It’s us who buys him an imported blood orange
---
Why the fuck are you being dowvoted this sub is fucking supid

Love it. The Spearmarshal set is one of my favourites for my Ranger along with the Sunspear weapons.
---
&gt; I know I'm playing on a potato, but I never had any graphic glitches.

I hope you're not insinuating that it's ANet's fault that you have a potato.
---
Coming in 3 years
---
What is wrong with taxiing to find populated content. Taxiing is totally a well supported completely functional feature of the LFG tool. 🙃
---
I know the flamethrower scrapper for PvE and that's even better now than it was in the past. That's the case for scrapper overrall tbh. But flamethrower in PvP I'm not sure I'm familiar with
---
&gt; Ah the ole
---
Yeah, the "ole". ;)
---
The only one getting exposed are you, but whatever you imagine. ;)
---
thank you :)
---
You dont have to be cheeky about it, mate.
---
Again, Silverwastes most certainly wasnt good either at its initial release. It lacked the proper rewards at the end without a world boss. It would certainly be shortsighted to already judge the maps future potential without knowing what the other half of this map will bring.
---
I mean it's not like we could always be right? We're dealing with beings that, for all intents and purposes, we have little to no knowledge of. It makes sense to be wrong there.
---
The end of the quest heavily implies he's on the way to becoming a Boneskinner himself, and the Boneskinner we kill in the map is one of the friends he mentioned
---
Presuming is much safer than assuming though, because we all know what assuming does...presuming does know such thing.  I'm also not judging others, but I can tell when people ignore something that has been stated or tend to slant it their own way, it's part of my job.
---
lul i dont even remember half of them,they are just random shit which needs to be removed,non of them is interesting and kids spamming *praise joke* will not change it.
---
at least you should do it once for the next 2 weeks to get the achievement for the different enemies.
---
As for ingots, probably their main sink is going to be 32-slot bags once the profit from selling weapons goes down. They require 70 ingots each but otherwise they are cheaper to craft that than the others. (But i still wonder who really needs 32 slot bags now that you get unidentified equipment and with 20 slot bags being super cheap)
---
thank you! :)
---
Just make sure you're prepared with triple-ply
---
I just take caps of vistas. There are so many really pretty ones. I have one up as wallpaper right now and a heap to choose from when I get bored with this one.
---
Lazarus still succeeded, Balthazar flatout killed us, Joko almost killed us and Braham. Before, we even had a Mesmer trap us in an illusion and led us to shell our own people.
---
We're constantly either tricked or defeated and only win by pure deus ex machina/plot armor.
---
Last I checked the 'dps golem' does damage back to you
---
&gt;I know I'm playing on a potato
---
Look on the bright side, at least you didnt take the screenie with your phone! :D
---
DWAYNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Lazarus wanted us to work with him to kill the dragons so he could sap their power, we refused and he had to try to steal from us to achieve his goal. We also broke the machine so he couldn't even get all that he wanted. We won.
---
Balthazar offered (through his herald) for us to work with/for him to kill the dragons, we denied that offer and then murdered him. He got the first kill, we got the final one. If anything we outsmarted him there since he didn't double tap (which for a guy allied with grenth at one point, you think he would be smart enough to destroy the soul).
---
Joko basically said if we serve and liberate him he would lend us his army, we told him to rot and stole his army to use for ourselves, we tricked *him* not the other way around. Getting hit by a plot drop stun trap hardly makes the Commander a fool.
---
Literally *only* shelling out people in the PS was where we had bad judgement, and Zhaitan having intelligent undead who can use mesmer illusions was something thought to be impossible before that so its hardly an obvious mistake.
---
Commander is a far cry from the hero of GW1 and rarely falls for obvious tricks, I have no idea why you need to lie about it so much. There's plenty of the game or character to rail about that are real concerns instead of your fake ones.
---
Not yet. One dev said they will be fixed in the next build.
---
It’s called escalator they’re popular in the Americas,  most of Asia and Europe as well Australia and even Africa
---
Thank you very much.
---
There are 2 other recipes for making 32 slot bags.  One with scorched stones from sandswept and one from a recipe found in the dwarven area in the Desert  Highlands.
---
So, this is now the 3rd.  I didn't count the story based one from Sandswept which is just one from a quest.
---
&gt; I dislike Lishtenbird's constant attention seeking
---
I don't know why I still even bother trying to entertain this sub or provide grounds for discussion. Each day it heads further from a cool place to hang out with the community of everyone's favourite game where you could just laugh at dumb stuff and talk, and more into a place where no matter what you do you would offend one of the several hate-filled tribes and, depending on the time of day and phase of the moon, get lynched one way or another.
---
thanks, i added it to my maptimer.xml now
---
Maybe I'll replay the instance for a third time and try to not be in an entirely different room when it happens. :P
---
Excellent ! cheers for the response. I understand the complications and rework that might be required though even for the smallest of changes. eek . Sounds promising though. I know so many people get annoyed with sound bloat
---
Please list your magic find. 
---
Maxed near 310 or boosted?
---
Or he just meant his mother. Kralk is Glint's father who is Aurene's (and Vlast's) mother. Dragons have families.
---
This is NOT an expansion pack.  They never said it would be one.
---
If you don't like it, just leave.
---
Not mentioned yet is the [Shadow Axe Skin](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shadow_Axe_Skin) which I like for its simple but dark theme.
---
&gt; Lazarus
---
Yes, we totally dived into this deep storyline. 
---
Technically you're right since you only said we killed these enemies, but still funny in this case
---
Thank you, just one thing: the color code for "downtime" events / no active meta is "00000000" (at least for all the other events in the maptimer.xml)
---
Indeed. No obscure gimmicks.
---
Always keep space in inventory before an outing.
---
Unsurprisingly, the game's own devs already followed that advice.
---
well not really the ingots drops from daily chests, you can also find in open world, and way more of them. So if you for some reason will want to craft lots of these new bags, you will be better parking alts on open world chest , then do SM.
---
well,it depends if you have 25 might and enemy have 25 vulne. im hitting mobz for 25 and bosses for 75 usualy. i dont rly care,bcs i have that buff so rarely..
---
Yes. This is better advice. 
---
You don't have to worry about those things if you do around acting like The Junk Lady from Labyrinth.
---
This is official dev response to that:
---
 
---
* **How Svanir got their raptors? Have they purchased PoF?**
---
&gt;The  devs laughed at this one and then said the Svanir stole PoF because  they're bad guys. Then they added that 'it looks cool'. Finally, they  posited that people lured by Jormag also happened to own mounts.
---
this reads as if raids were the core of the game though, while they are the peak of the endgame kinda rather from what i read sofar... seems a bit off.
---
also you can use executioner axe in the area if you use it from novelty tab in H
---
with "the season" do u mean what exactly? these ice-thingys definitely are a farmable currency.
---
"expose"?
---
Seriously?
---
Saying that not all criticism is constructive somehow means "raids are killing the game"?
---
Comments like this are why this sub is going to shit.
---
Sounds good: I'll be heading there Tuesday night, will hit you up Weds. :)
---
The first tier is just a skin not an actual weapon. The restored ones are all crafted yes.
---
Simply said its because their management is awful. They've seen both, know that expansion generates massive hype, pushes sales. Who knows what was scrapped during the layoffs, living world will never live up to expansion content, ever. At best it is the filler between expansions like any other minor or major patch you see in other MMOs. Their development team is so chaotic and disconnected that I think the game is done at this point. 
---
Few living world here and there with gem shop stuff is the future. Rarely can a company fail so often and make the same mistakes and still be standing. Honestly should be grateful of NCSoft because I bet most other publishers would have pulled the plug by now due to all the retarded decisions.
---
GW2 is like a live test rat where every bad decision that can be made has been and just repeats ad nauseam. If we base the success of other MMOs and incorporate it into GW2 we should have: new dungeons, raids, races, abilities, etc. And small things matter too believe it or not, like fishing and other side stuff that would bring more players into the game.
---
This game should have had so many things added at this point its pretty funny how badly it was managed and they STILL don't know what their whole 'vision' for the game is. First no expansion, then expansion, now no xpac again. Lol like a child that can't make up their damn mind. At this point the only reason its still running is to be milked, and one can only hope that ANet is still left standing at the end of the day to create a GW3, though I really don't see the point. Its not like GW2 was anywhere near as good as 1 and only seems to get worse due to poor vision and management.
---
The fact that we can't even go to all the existing areas from GW1 like cantha is an insult and was only made to prolong the game and rehash everything. What pisses me off about that is the chances of seeing cantha my favorite area in any game ever are basically 0% now because ANet is dumb. If they just added a few devs to GW and continued its support I wouldn't even care about this trash game at all.
---
G2A is not an approved seller by the Lionguard and can lead to trouble if bought from. Just stick with the approved merchants so I don't have to come bail you out, recruit.

Ahh fellow longbow user...

I see you are a man of culture aswell
---
I don't know much about PvP but Holo and Scrapper in WvW are meta, esp. Healing scrapper is tons of fun in WvW.
---
Turrets in competitive game are pretty weak , only healing turret is a viable option.
---
I live outside of the US.
---
Yeah, I know abut G2A. That's why I was asking what else is there (that is reliable and trustworthy).
---
on the contrary, it's probably the wisest move for someone who's going to play the map everyday for a while. Just the strike mission and the chests gives you quite a bunch every day. You would have plenty of those after a few days to complete all the weapons while many people were willing to pay a lot for those.
---
But after 7 years core is getting unblockable elixir throw, isn't that great /s
---
Heritage helm would work better
---
While having the Endless Boneskinner Tonic transform your character portrait gets a Champion border when you go out of the Tonic it stays around for people that have you targeted.
---
While this is probably a bug having different tiers of Titles linked with Portraits would be nice to show experience in certain modes
---
You have to look at the post, there is the raid relation.
---
kk
---
I'd assume it's from the train [payback](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Payback)
---
Not even legendary ? You don't deserve to be a SC ;p
---
Wait a second, video games were made to give players choice over played character. So, are you  saying GW2 fails at this? I would say so.
---
Option that most lower fps in order:
---
Character model limit : extreme performance hit choose low to increase fps
---
Character model quality :  medium
---
Reflection  : terrain and sky
---
Shadow  ; medium is usually enough or try high and see fps.
---
Jormag is speaking through him.
---
nah, if you take a look at every release from S2-S4 no new use for specific map material is used anywhere else with the exception of the legendary trincket at the end of the season (well, skyscale also required cross release materials). For this map the requirement will probaly be to have the meta achievement completed and 250+ eternal ice (no weapons will be asked for since you can just purchase them directly). 
---
In any case, if the next release which is probably also located in the same map uses these ingots people will have more than enough time to stock on a lot of them. I always have a good reserve of everything just in case, but on the first few days the priority for those who play a lot would be to make profit.
---
:(
---
Oh, Pale Tree! What have I done?! WHAT HAVE I DONE???!!!
---
I'll definitely look into that, thanks!
---
Lower your shadows and reflections to low, along with the other suggestions.
---
I don't mind. At least, he didn't say a single word about Kodan balance bs. Which is great.
---
if UK i use instantgaming or buy directly ingame
---
I'd rather they just had autogroup for raids, but the encounters aren't really designed for it
---
While I usually agree with you, at this point why care about such minmax in pug raids - just go higher and let more people raid, a little bit of toughness won't make any difference in your ability to kill the boss in anything but a training. Encourage them to get the right build but don't turn it into a bad experience for them or they could likely turn out to stop raiding. We need all the players we can get. ):
---
Idiot ...
---
Is it just me or is there an unusual amount of lag currently? My ping can swing from almost 1000 to under 50 in a few moments.
---
and idiots not knowing what part joko and caudecus (the white mantle) played in gw1, should maybe shut up.
---
Thx, can't wait:-P
---
&gt; Marjory + Kas - more this season, they both more matured, changed: they wanna synthesize these changes with the gameplay, not just show it
---
Oh, I halfway liked them when we met in LS2, but now they're unreliable. I want allies who I can trust not to run away halfway through a story.
---
&gt; "Almorra's" call by Jormag: didn't want the sound make too obvious, added some hints (static, disruptions), "zombie Almorra using the comm, Jormag controlling the hands
---
I never picked up on it being Jormag using the comms until it was specifically laid out by the characters.
---
&gt; Frost: they don't want to hinder gameplay but still want the player to feel claustrophobic, anxious, not to completely see where the enemies are coming from
---
I noticed sometimes that the enemies were coming so hot and heavy that I couldn't even stop to drop a well because I was too busy running and dodging. (Either that, or they were coming from all directions and it's hard to switch targets to something behind you.) That severely impacts gameplay in my opinion. There were many times I was like, "ok, fuck it! You can keep the camp."

I love how you guys don't even play the game you defend so hard.
---
Hard to expect anything more from brainless drones though.
---
just want to point out that that is very clearly not almorra
---
Maybe I'm thinking of something else, but I thought there was a vendor in a map somewhere that would unlock some backpack/glider skins if you only had one of the two unlocked.  I think I remember doing that for the crystalline wings backpack.
---
I loove playing Minstrel Scrapper, it's much more engaging, to me, than Firebrand or Tempest.
---
Yikes. That's terrifying :(
---
&gt;  from a people-eating deer demon
---
One of which was his former kodan friend. That scared me more than anything else.
---
"Got some tasty undead quaggan here. Want it??"
---
I hope that Bright Shore will show up on the next maps and yes with the implications.
---
To be honest, Asura have been all about treating other races as nothing more than lab rats or ingredients to use in experiments. Look at all the stuff they did to the Sylvari when they first met.
---
Yep, I love it!
---
Looks like her to me - that said, the video quality's not great, and the way the ghosts are rendered makes most armor very dark, so I can also see how it might not be her. I won't swing one way or the other until I've seen her in-game, probably.
---
That's a bit subtle.  It would've been better to have affirmatively stated that grothmar was losing public instance support.
---
Sword and board
---
noted. i was going off the event timer wiki page for the colors
---
&gt;Essence manipulation mastery increase - yes, in ep2. After that, they don't know yet (if this mastery re-appears)
---
Why do they insist on making living world masteries extremely sitiuational map locked gimmicks that are forgoten the instant map completion is done? For once can't they make masteries a long term thing that actually develops your charter as you advance through them? You know, what a mastery should actually be? Sigil of agony was great, why don't they do more stuff like it?
---
What if Canach's thoughts in ["Be My Guest"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Be_My_Guest) mean more than we realize? He states, "You know, I'd almost forgotten Aurene was a dragon. In my head, she was more of a *person in dragon form*". Maybe the Elder Dragons have a shape-shifting ability that allows them to assume other forms? Or maybe the way that we view them is based on the gift of True Sight? The Commander has this gift, as per ["The Last Chance"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Last_Chance).
---
I believe that the nature of our *relationship* with creatures like Elder Dragons may change based on our genetics, or, if you find that too speculative, circumstances.
---
&gt;They straight up said at PAX that ep 1 and 2 are intertwined and the maps are shared, mostly by expanding Bjora outwards.
---
Otherwise known as "1 episode cut in 2" so they can just do less.
---
I've seen a brainwashed vigil soldier in the Aberrant Forest, holding a dagger, speaking to himself, surrounded by dead bodies. he didn't attack or anything, just... standing there, staring into the void.
---
don't sell the restored boreal weapons on the tp. unlock them to your account. Though i'd stop selling once the price drops then farm ignots to unlock that cheevo.
---
Teeth clicking?
---
yea they are crafted.
---
You can get a good few seconds behind him when he does his cool ranch hundred blades thing, but other than that, yeah, he's pretty dangerous to be near. I've also seen him get distracted slaughtering a nearby moose that got too close.
---
Hmm ... imagine the shitstorm if they do add ascended and you need the exotic to upgrade because most people will probably have either salvaged or forged them already
---
the restored boreal weapons are pretty ugly too, no special effects like the istan ones. but to each there own.
---
Sick.
---
Kodan are not human. And even humans can live on meat alone, like Inuit do.
---
Also, wendigo turn into wendigo when they go cannibal.  
---
With werewolf lore killing the world that scratched someone prevents the transformation, but I've never heard any kind of lore of people stopped a wendigo transformation by eating a wendigo. If anything the kodan should be asking for other kodan to eat, like the fallen kodan.
---
It just doesn't add up. Even if that was the writers intended.
---
it'd be nice if they made em more like raid mechanics, slightly harder then current bjora strikes,  and gave 1/2 (or something less) raid tokens. See it as kind of a training ground tool for raids.
---
You mean slowly turning into a Wendigo makes one unstable? I never would have guessed.
---
Hi 
---
thank you for noticing!  Expanding of picture was fixed and thank you for suggestion. I will think how to combine it. I don't want it to be confusing.
---
Fixed. Thank you very much for noticing!
---
You are welcome. I am happy I could help!
---
Humans can live on meat alone, if they eat the correct meat. The Kodan was not eating the correct meat.
---
They're a pain to get a hold of. I was going to get some to send to my nephew who I know plays. I wanted him to have something to open, physically, on the day. But you just can't get them in the UK at all. The only "official retailers" listed on the site are GAME, who don't even sell Path of Fire, only Heart of Thorns, even though it's not even a thing you can buy on its own any more, and Amazon, who only have resellers selling physical gem cards for ~£50 for 800 gems, i.e. a scam. I'm just going to have to send money or gift them in game, if you can do that.
---
yeah, ambrite, and why? because there was so much of it that anet had to find more purposes for it, same as other materials that shared the same problem. If those ingots are still used on next episode it will be because there's so much of them that they would require more sinks. I personally believe it will not be the case. A 32 slot bag requires 70 of them so there you have a good sink for it (if people is really in need of so big bags)
---
As for the current map, i believe we already have half of it, maybe 1/3rd, so the entire season would still need at least 1-2 more maps.
---
They guy didn't even mention expansion packs, but in any case, anet said the saga would have expansion worthy content.
---
No one is surprised that the map is cut in two.  People are surprised that we are supposed to be getting "expansion like features" in these episodes and we got half of an episode across the board.
---
Over promising and under-delivering. The reason they don't communicate or promise anything is to avoid doing this.
---
I've been using Synapse long before I started using arc and there has never been any issue with that. Starting from the most recent episode there does seem to be very frequent disconnects though.
---
It's one of those tips that should be in an adventure guide for video game character. "Always keep free space in your backpack before adventuring", "Check waterfalls for hidden caves", "Keep your starting equipment in case hidden endgame quest requires is".
---
The Jimquisition or whatever it’s called video nailed it pretty well.
---
“It’s still pokemon, it’s going to be fun.” It’s “Nintendo’s Dynasty Warriors (ironically more than Hyrule and Fire Emblem Warriors was).”
---
They’re still great games and it’s just fun. It just “could be more.”
---
No no, I just want to turn Kodan in something even worse than Boneskinner. :D
---
you mean i shoud care about imaginery character from 15 years old game? are you ok little buddy?
---
I saw a Vigil soldier out in the field south of the keep with an event marker, so I headed over there and only got the shortest glimpse of the Boneskinner as it came out of stealth and snatched her away. I wish there was more of that, and less of the tank &amp; spank oft-repeated event where you see it the most :(
---
Ngl I really dislike the usage of cc cons :| I already didn’t really like that using cons became a staple in artsariiv records (though I still somewhat understood that since it was only in the cc phase), but using cc cons to actually break the boss is kinda disappointing to me. Other than that, the Kill is obviously great and the Condi firebrand usage is cool!
---
Its not that rare though? I hear people getting it quite often and I got it once myself while only doing like 7 strike missions. Dont know if drop rate is somewhere?
---
just have skin unlocked to craft the ascended version.
---
Because they promised bigger and bigger things time and time again, always got everyone's hopes up and then let them down once too many times.
---
this is not a map material but a saga material but i may be wrong. we'll see
---
I guess my question is: WHY is it the straw? Like I said, it seems like pretty standard fare for GW2 and ANet, so I am trying to understand why this was the breaking point.
---
You can gift them some items from the Store, or send the equivalent in gold for your nephew to transfer.
---
I didn't have to answer any questions.
---
I just entered, ran through, and collected 4 chests of loot.
---
It took like 2 mins. ???
---
Watch him come back in the next episode insane af and he’s gonna be a boss
---
Yeah, and the huge praise given for the Joko cutscene as well as the LS4 ending cutscene IMO shows that they really should make these cutscenes involve the player character.  Pre-recording is easier and cheaper, but the extra effort is worth it for that extra immersion.
---
Sadly not.
---
This makes sense, as far is it being the first chapter / insight into what is to come. I understand that it's not the best content, but what I didn't get was why it was the proverbial straw, when like I said, it seems pretty standard. But this makes sense, thank you.
---
Much apreciated mate &lt;3  And i must agree for the cc consumables. Despite the practice, there wasnt an easy fix (stacking weaverfgs5 metoer precast and then ccing with weaver instead) the limiting factor became the slb cc :/
---
I think we finally hit the point where the open world content is suffering and now the "I don't play your game mode, just quit because this doesn't affect me!" crowd is now being affected. It's truly a shame because what there is of the content is exactly what I want to play, there's just... not that much of it and the future looks kind of uncertain.
---
Agreed, I think in that way, adding mechanics for that reason mostly introduces apathy in the playerbase as they have to think less and less. I think you can definitely help new players without making mechanics optional, or how to put it.
---
I don't even hate the essence thing when it works, like if it's just one moment where you use it like with the Kodan. You should never have it replace actual skills you pick for your character, though.
---
Ah cool, thanks!
---

“Everything is on the table, but nothing is on the horizon.”
---
Damn dude. You summed it pretty well right there. I hate it, but you’re right.
---
Nothing too fancy, but here's [mine](https://pastebin.com/z8aDTaM7).
---
idk if fractal population is dead... it's pretty easy to find daily t4 + cm groups imo
---
This is seriously amazing! You're incredible!!
---
This is the way.
---
That's because the horizon is also on the table.
---
Taimi in LS4 certainly was toned down, because she was replaced by Gorrick. I forgot to mention this. Anet has to be able to do story without having to rely on an asura behind an inter comm telling us what to do. That has been happening since LS2 its ridiculous. Taimi, and later Gorrick, single handedely moved the plot foward in LS3 and LS4, with Taimi having some relevance in HoT and LS2 still. It has to stop. They have to introduce new characters, or let others shine through.
---
If he's not the strike mission Boneskinner in 1-2 weeks, Anet would have missed a very obvious beat.
---
I was debating with myself on whether I should continue feeding... but all that meta achievement completion and rewards finally pushed me over the edge.
---
I would recommend just playing the game and doing hearts/events for your first character. 
---
No need to rush things. Plenty of time to spend grinding on your later characters, you only get to see the game as a new player once. Sit back and enjoy the ride.
---
Later on you can level up alts with leveling tomes or even just buy a level 80 boost if you want to level up fast.
---
* we were expecting an expansion after pof
---
* they said no expansion but assured us that the saga would give us everything we were looking for from expansions anyways
---
* saga did not have what we were looking for from expansions
---
It hit me hard enough as I had been there before the story took me there, and I never noticed. It hit hard because I had literally walked right by her.
---
What's the fraenir?
---
Me, having just spent the last few days playing around in Kourna: wew! Banner of the commander is crafted! lemme just dismantle this worthless exotic backpack for the few ecto and see what's needed for the upgraded version :) 
---
me, three seconds later: i am the dumbest human being alive.
---
For world bosses you can type "/wiki et" in the game chat and you will see all of the regularly scheduled events and their timers. World bosses are at the top and you can follow links to see where they are on which maps
---
Haha it's so funny you say this, because one of my fav things about gw2 is that I can play it as a single player game.
---
Or maybe it's an escalator.
---
But why other than personal preference?
---
I haven’t been playing/following gw2 for that long, although have nearly 5k hours. 
---
The crazy thing that i’m noticing on this sub is how displeased EVERYONE is now. 5+ months ago, anyone talking about the neglect of pvp and wvw were written off as playing a “dead mode” and that balancing for anything other than raid content was stupid. Anyone begging anet to communicate, anyone criticizing anet deemed as being “toxic”.
---
Well look what happened. Even pve players are getting shafted, anet doesn’t seem to care about anyone who is actually invested in the game. Anet is using living worlds and sagas to encourage casual players to remonetize. 
---
Let that sink in. 
---
Sagas exist to remonetize users. Not for balance, not for features, not because anet cares.
---

---
Technically there are a whole lot more episodes to come that MAY deliver raids, fractals, mounts and mount skins, elite specs, a lot of interesting and very big maps, maybe even races or classes. 
---
So we definitely should buy more things from the GemStore to encourage ANet to make these things. 
---
Kappa
---
Thank you. Must have recently updated since last time I did /wiki et and it was not showing. Still does not exactly explain why it's not occurring on all instances.
---
not gonna lie, you had me in the first half
---
I still think the whole Tengu and Cantha thingy should be on it too. 
---
There's no way they implemented the refugees and the Tengu in this way, not planning to put them on the table
---
Scheduled events will not occur in instances that are created beyond a certain amount of time after the scheduled start time. That time limit was mentioned somewhere around the time of megaservers being released. I think it was 15m? Memory is fuzzy.
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification.
---
with how little content was in this one, we better be getting an episode every month tbh
