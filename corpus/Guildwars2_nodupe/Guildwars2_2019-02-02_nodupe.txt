It was not in the rules when they released that showcase, wouldn't be the first time they edit stuff later though no way to prove it so if it is then fine.

---
Yea and to you and that person, could you find one good reason why Anet would go out of their way to make a video about 2 ppl that couldn't care less about gw2 since before HoT released when there are so many others with similar stories that still actually play the game? I cannot think of any.
---
Saying "hey here are 2 ppl that met in our game then quit, one is streamer btw but you wont find a single guild wars stream there for year+ and afterwards too." is not good marketing. Cannot believe people can even argue against that.

One thing I've wanted them to do for ages was allow some sort of "&lt;Race&gt; Studies" mastery lines.  One for each of the 5 races.  Next to no MP costs, all it does is once you clear it it allows all characters on your account to use that race's racial skills.  If they really wanted to add to it they could have small mini quests where you get made an honourary warband member, honourary krewe member, honourary warden, etc. before you gain access to the skills for that character.  Just have clearing the mastery be what unlocks it.

In the meta atm, boon support renegade is valued far higher than condi. I suppose in reality I would be fine with a boon based renegade had herald not been a thing, but at this point it seems like herald and renegade should be balanced into more defined roles

Nice try Mirage main.

I loved engineer. I now love Holosmith. Engineer is dead. Long live Holosmith.
---
I don't play PvP, but there are automated tournaments now, multiple times a week, with decent rewards it seems. The esports dreams have been given up though, so don't expect top levels of polish and balance. 
---
Wvw has become pretty zergy indeed. I'm sure that you can still make a difference in the smaller clashes, but the roaming scene has suffered greatly over the years, so most seem to bundle up into zergs these days.The devs are busy with a rework of the WvW grouping system, where merged server populations get replaced by an alliance system of sorts. That may be the saving grace for many of us, although no one knows when it'll be ready.
---
As for rewards, there's a pip system now where you get participation points after every 15 mins or so, with increasingly better rewards throughout the week. There's also of course the reward tracks, and legendary armor+backpiece to go for as a long term goal. All in all, the reward system is better than ever.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
As for the game itself, it's ever increasing in overall quality. We have more raids by now, more fractals, more pvp maps, many more pve maps, many more viable builds and we've regularly seen overhauls of some system or another. Even stuff as core as mesmer's phantasms have seen a rework.
---
The power creep has been real though, but Anet is trying to contain it all, and the ingame economy didn't implode either so yay?
---
I'm totally okay with this, honestly. I'd much prefer to jump between content and still feel like I'm optimising rather than grind one map/event/fractal endlessly.
---
My previous server. I don't miss them at all.

You've seen through his lies! See, he can't actually PLAY guitar, he is using a pocket hole, and his buddy is sitting on the other side, reaching through to play the instrument. He's just pretending.

You're utterly correct &lt;3 I'm working on a second post on the Desolation, but gathering screenshots has been delayed a little due to um, certain mechanics. XD And I also think Surmia/Drascir would be absolutely fascinating, I just wasn't around GW1 for when the Tombs of Drascir were actually a thing so I won't be able to make an album of screenshots for it.
---
What Waffams said. It's dying because of that attitude that it's already dead, and people don't want to start raiding because they're scared of players like you.

---
I'm just bad at it. Whenever I try to play Condi Rev but need to do something _useful_ (as in an interrupt or corrupt boons) the whole rotation goes out the window and DPS drops severely. It's like weaver. If you dare to try to CC at the wrong time you're in DPS hole :( but then you need it for fractals so... Ugh. Always run out of energy at the wrong time, seldom do full proper rotation :( feels bad

Removing corruption is kinda unique since most dragons don't corrupt the environment, just creatures. The only other one that corrupts the land would be Kralk and the Brand. But since Zhaitan was based entirely out of Orr, purifying it could be seen like poisoning him and the bulk of his minions. Also, reversing corruption is not something easy to do and I think the Source of Orr was the only time it was seen outside of the Altar of Glaust.
---
The minion thing does make some sense, but it does feel a bit forced. Weakening is not the same as a weakness. The other weakness have all been something offensively exploitable, like a gap in their armor kind of stuff. I suppose you could say starving Zhaitan make it weak enough to be injured by weapons like cannons, but it still feels like more a retcon than a weakness that was planned from the start. Then again, the early writing was a bit lacking so maybe that was the plan...
---
Personally, I think the Zhaitan story works better if we didn't exploit a weakness. We overwhelmed him with firepower instead which is why the Pact suffered so many losses; we did it the hard way. But it seems the later story is suggesting that Dragons can only be killed by their weakness, which feels a bit lame. On that note, I do think every Dragon has two weaknesses, one for each domain. So if the minion weakness was Zhaitan's Death Domain weakness, there would be another for the Shadow Domain.
---
Support chrono in pve for sure. Mesmer is also top tier in pvp.
---
If you decide to stick with reaper, zerk isn't really required for open world (or even dungeons / lower fractals).
---
I'm playing my reaper in full valkyrie (weapons are still berserker) with wurm runes, which adds alot of extra vitality and ferocity, soul reaping and reaper traits will enhance your seemingly lacking crit chance. 
---
you end up being basically unkillable while still being able to hit like a truck (in reaper shroud, outside of shroud your main goal is to reaquire life force as quickly as possible).
---
It's in huge demand in pve. When it comes to pvp you can easily play multiple classes as you dont need to gear them up (maybe buy a few runes/amulets, but it's kinda cheap nowadays).
---
As I wrote in the description, the community asked the guild to open the tag and go EB to gather people and fight. Anyway as you can see even the enemy has a blob. I'm sorry if this offended you.
---
In the video there are also clips with 15 and 20 ppl when we fought against other guilds, even if they had bigger numbers. 
---
Thanks :) 
---
The person above is Uberhaxernova, a youtuber. This is probably just an odd coincidence, but I thought it was neat how closely they look alike. 
---
Are you from Gandara?
---
Not true imho. But I do also, as others said, like 20 ppl max too 
---
Unfortunately. Only a couple of bags are affected by magic find, and they're all clearly marked as such.
---
&gt; Removing corruption is kinda unique since most dragons don't corrupt the environment, just creatures.
---
Literally every Elder Dragon corrupts the environment. Literally. Every. One. Hell, Primordus doesn't corrupt creatures, it makes minions *out of the environment*.
---
And sans Primordus, there are events or hearts out there to destroy or attempt to revert said corruption. Mind you, such is on small scale that's ultimately pointless and is at best merely slowing down the spread of corruption.
---
&gt; But since Zhaitan was based entirely out of Orr, purifying it could be seen like poisoning him and the bulk of his minions.
---
It wasn't poisoning him, it was removing a food source. The cannons on the Glory of Tyria, which were based on Gorr's research, was effectively poisoning him. But they only had such a strong effect so as to make his body literally fall apart because he was already weakened due to the campaign.
---
&gt; Also, reversing corruption is not something easy to do and I think the Source of Orr was the only time it was seen outside of the Altar of Glaust.
---
Ehhhhhhhh... Cleansing minions, that's hard to do. But environmental corruption? There's literally a hundred hearts and events that has us doing that throughout HoT, Ascalon, northern Shiverpeaks, PoF, and S4.
---
On top of those cases, which are fairly minor and more of "slowing/ceasing the spread of corruption" in the end because of how minorly effective they are, there is the far more effective attempt that was the collection that leads up to being able to craft the Astral and Stellar weapons, which is all about purifying the Kralkatorrite ingots. And there's what we did with Mawdrey too.
---
None of that is on the scale of what Trahearne does, mind you. But again, that's not poisoning anything for Zhaitan, it's just cutting him off from a magic source.
---
&gt; Weakening is not the same as a weakness.
---
In this context it is, as it seems one must utilize their unique weakness to weaken them to make the vulnerable to more conventional weapons. Our fights with Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik are ultimately the exact same, but less drawn out, scenario as with Zhaitan.
---
Fighting Mordremoth in the Dream didn't kill him, it made him vulnerable to being killed. Exploiting the weakness weakened him to a vulnerable state.
---
Using the resonance crystals on Kralkatorrik didn't kill him, it made him vulnerable to being killed by normal weaponry. Though we end up failing in the end, we could only cut out his eye with our own normal weapons and spells because we used the Dragonsblood Spears and Resonance Crystals on him.
---
"Unique weakness" has thus far translated into "method to make them vulnerable" not "the method to kill them". So method of weakening that won't work on other Elder Dragons = their unique weakness.
---
Of course, draining of magic should work on *all* Elder Dragons (thus why Trahearne cleansing the Artesian Waters or the metas cutting off the temples' and statues' magic from Zhaitan wouldn't be a *unique* weakness while killing the Eyes and Mouths would), just as theoretically using their opposing magic should cause volatile explosions per A Crack in the Ice doing such between Zhaitan and Mordremoth's domains, and may be why Jormag's and Primordus' so called "unique weakness" isn't that unique (in other words: may be something that'll kill them, but it ain't their unique weakness and Taimi was wrong as balls).
---
&gt; The other weakness have all been something offensively exploitable, like a gap in their armor kind of stuff.  I suppose you could say starving Zhaitan make it weak enough to be injured by weapons like cannons, but it still feels like more a retcon than a weakness that was planned from the start.
---
Well using the gap in the armor metaphor, we stabbed at the place where he was most readily vulnerable, specialized minions in the middle of its territory that wasn't as heavily defended as itself.
---
&gt; Personally, I think the Zhaitan story works better if we didn't exploit a weakness. We overwhelmed him with firepower instead which is why the Pact suffered so many losses; we did it the hard way.
---
I disagree, because the weakness situation makes it barely more reasonable and realistic for how an army using magic could possibly kill a magic consuming Eldritch Abomination Dragon of such great age that it's hard to count just how old and powerful they are (supposed to be).
---
It always felt silly to me that we could end this world shattering being with some simple poison magic.
---
&gt; But it seems the later story is suggesting that Dragons can only be killed by their weakness, which feels a bit lame.
---
Not really, on both accounts. The lame bit, per above. The 'only killed by their weakness', well, so far not a single "unique weakness" has killed an Elder Dragon when exploited. Just made them vulnerable to being killed.
---
&gt; On that note, I do think every Dragon has two weaknesses, one for each domain. So if the minion weakness was Zhaitan's Death Domain weakness, there would be another for the Shadow Domain.
---
No real show of this, though it would make sense, but the unique weakness for Mordremoth is more a weakness that could only exist for the same reason his unique strength exists - the combination of plant and mind.
---
Mordremoth's strength was the ability to transfer its mind through the Dream to its corruption, thus surviving bodily death and effectively having multiple bodies. His weakness was cutting off that ability, making it possible to kill him by killing whichever body/bodies his mind currently inhabits (at the time of death, Trahearne + Mouth of Mordremoth (his core body)). One could argue that's just the weakness/strength of Mind, so then what would plant be (please don't say exposure to death &gt;.&gt;)?
---
Incidentally, since we don't know Kralkatorrik's second domain yet (though I'm still convinced it's sky), and his weakness is solely linked to the crystal side of things, what could that other weakness be and why has it yet to be mentioned if the Forgotten, through Glint, know his weakness(es)?
---
Mine went the opposite way. My nephew is now called Saladboii2k17
---
Agree to disagree I guess
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
:) Well, on the Forgotten: before humans arrived in Tyria, the Forgotten territories were not just in the Crystal Desert, they were also in Ascalon. The Humans drove the Charr north, and the Forgotten south. 
---
It is part of the dive that is near there.   Waaaaaay up, there is a dude.  It really hard to get to, cannot remember the name of it.  But I think it is associated with that (and him).  Not sure if it is halloween related or trying to suggest to you the hidden JP in the area.  Anyway, that is my thought.

Aren't druid and holosmith basically necromancer?
---
There's no harm on creating solid core mechanics, and then sharing them across professions. It's better than trying to pull something new and unique every time, which is doomed to lead to cheap gimmicks in the long run. It would also help balance, and allow new types of upgrade components geared towards profession mechanics.
---
Extremely good in endgame PvE; one of if not the highest power dps in the game and brings the most cc of any dps class with basilisk venom. Also gets a fair amount of utility for free from steal skills, depending on the target. 
---
There's also a "boon thief" build which is only really useful on Matthias that uses the steal skill from that fight to give 100% uptime of every boon other than alacrity (including resistance) to everyone in the group by themselves, trivializing the fight.
---
Prepare for ban from your popsicle stick hacks xD
---
To piggyback off this question, does it matter what level toon you open/salvage on? I have 300 base MF, and have saved up a few stacks. I would like to max MF, open, then salvage. Would you use a level 40 toon like SW bags, or do unids not matter?
---
That makes no sense though. In any case, visiting Jahai in episode two, right before the final battle, is what would have made sense in the first place. You know, learn from the past, to defeat him again, etc.
---
Jahai being the location of Joko's first defeat isn't even mentioned across the episode. Hell, if you don't know your GW1 stuff you might not even know it's controlled by Joko, since there's absolutely ZERO statues of him in the fortress.

To effectively +1, you have to know what is the winning/losing/even matchup between each class and know which fight you can +1. Also thief is so squishy that it relies heavily on dodge to survive, that you have to know rah classes' most hitting skill.
---
Yeah, this whole sub-quest is extremely bad designed imo. I would've likely breezed thru the main quest already otherwise but getting stuck at something as mundane as this was so frustrating i quit in the middle of it twice now. Finally got it to work after figuring out \*where\* they actually want you to put the first puddle, i did the logical thing and kept chosing the spot at the back of the vehicle which is the least distance to the vent but even when the fire went RIGHT up all the way to the vehicle it just wouldn't explode, leading me to believe that the quest might be bugged. But no, it's just very poorly and lazily designed without any kind of indication for the player as to where the fire line has to go.

# How to open bags
---
1. If available, open bags with gear + mats first.
---
2. As soon as your inventory is encumbered, you deposit all mats.
---
3. Now you can take all emcumbered items.
---
4. Salvage everything, but do NOT deposit all mats now.
---
5. Instead, open all bags again until you are emcumbered.
---
6. Now deposit all mats to make space in your inventory.
---
7. Take all emcumbered items.
---
8. Repeat from 4.
---
As regards the previosu Friend/Ships stories, did anything bad or creepy ACTUALLY happen?
---
Or was it all on us / the readers side who decided it was?
---
i.e Unless a story fills a certain set of pre-determined checkboxes, it's a scam, fake or whatever.
---
No wonder Anet are terrified of doing anything.
---
I would prefer this to it telling me it can't open bags because it will fill  my inventory, if i'm being honest.
---
I mean there are many other MMORPGs that make you feel that way, that YOU are the hero, its YOUR story, then the open world is different, atleast thats what I know from the few other games of the same genre I’ve played
---
Like and subscribe to find out. 
---
Focus on learning the thief skills and mechanics first, I assume u are using a decent build. Then learn rotations, how to move around the map based on your and the enemy team (this is extremely important for a thief). 
---
You also have to learn the core class mechanics, things you have to avoid and things you can interrupt with steal etc. Some stuff needs a bit more active learning but most comes with experience, so just keep playing!
---
Is that accurate, and their is evidence / proof of all this etc?
---
Alacrity renegade is meta support for fractals now. 
---
Also condi renegade is the strongest condi DPS right now. Ofc except those bosses where mirrage confusion goes off the charts.
---
So revenants are in a pretty good spot right now.

I never thought about it before, but Jesus was a middle-eastern guy, and there are barely any Christians in the middle-east.

Not this again... I'm glad that people make friends in-game but I guess people would be more interested in other things than knowing how two strangers met.
---
My main complaint is that rev feels like a lot of cool ideas packed into one without any consideration of if the skills, traits, and playstyles mesh together. It's like eating steak with a side of Skittles. 
---
Another note is most classes have neutral abilities tied to the their class mechanic traitline. Rev has no skills tied to invocation, and instead glint fills that role instead but is tied to an elite spec. 
---
The weapons are lacking due to originally being a no weapon swap class. The problem here is now the weapons are weakened, given cooldowns, and lack a complimentary weapon set for weapon swap. Instead of getting one strong weapon set that fits my build, I get two weapon sets where one is ok, and the other is whatever weapon doesn't suck the most for your build. This is usually staff because it has a block and cc.
---
Hammer is a cool weapon, but it doesn't go with any legends. I'd assume conceptually it should go with dwarf because dwarves use hammers, but why would you use a ranged weapon for what's supposed to be a tank legend, but fails miserably at being tanky. Instead it gives weird support abilities, and is really only useful for the stab field.
---
With how heavy and single focused the stat allocation is in this game, you can't build for two opposite legends for a build. This means every legend needs another legend it works with in order to be worthwhile. This sucks because things like mallyx and ventari lack a good legend combination to work with core. 
---
I dont mind the energy system and actually find it fun and satisfying. My problem is why have both this and cooldowns. I enjoy having short cooldowns because of this, but it seems counter productive to have a system meant to remove cooldowns and increase skill availability, and then add cooldowns because Anets too lazy or unskilled to balance the energy system by itself. Even though mallyx can be clunky to play, one of the reasons I love it is because it retains the no cooldown, spam gameplay that was originally intended for the class. This way, I can save up energy and use something like banish enchantments on a guardian or boonbeast multiple times and actually experience a benefit from charging my energy instead of just blowing it when cooldowns are up. 
---
And now for the elite specs. Because core rev lacks anything neutral, every elite spec ends up having to do too much and not being able to be focused on specific concepts. We get herald, who looks like a support spec, but ends up just being this neutral thing that has easily accesible utility skills that are required that core lacks. This includes an actually good heal, a quick and free stunbreak, and for the most part a bunch of free skills and access to protection. 
---
Renegade was supposed to be an offensive support professions, which it does, but it's all over the place without any unified goal in mind. It's sort of a condition spec, but not really. We get the condition bow, but it's rather lackluster and you really only use it because it's your only other choice for considering builds. Our utilities are summons and sort of act like field control devices, but like razorclaw or whatever one provides bleeds is just weird. It only works in a condition build, while the other utilities have nothing to do with condition builds. Then they throw in weird things like the kalla f abilities that are cool, but they are just so random. 
---
I assume these are pictures of prior work that they have done rather than actually selling them?
---
I can't wait to see how Anet screws such a cute thing again this year.
---
Making it guild based, say 20v20 or so. (or maybe larger like alliances intends to do)
---
Adding a WVW only mount (Dolyak, slower then others but put some neat utility on it)
---
Adding some environmental stuff (long grass like on sandswept isles, maybe a place to cause rock slides, Some gaps with bridges that can be blown up.
---
More variety in attacks for siege weapons, (Emp shot for treb or cats) Catrolops for cannons/mortars etc...) or more siege weapons (placeable cannon &amp; mortar would be nice)
---
It seems its less random than I first thought. here is a page for the action figure:

As you fly, or should I say "glide", with the griffon you will begin to lose momentum. The key is to quickly dive twice to build up that momentum and speed, the moment you begin moving forward quickly flap your wings to gain a small bit of altitude/height then immediately pull up as far as you can. Once you reach as high as you can, flap wings for a bit more height but also to start your next set of dives. Repeating the process until desired altitude is achieved.
---
Side note: I probably should have explained that better in the first place. Probably wouldn't have received the down votes. Oh well, live and learn.

See if you cant find some people who wouldnt mind helping you start a "CoF exp farm" aka farming infinitely spawning mobs from a mechanic in Path 1 of the Citadel of Flame dungeon.

There's no in game model, but they do exist in Tyria.  They are seen in one of the guild wars Novels (Edge of Destiny) and mentioned by NPCs all over the game, including Queensdale as being used to pull carts and carriages.

Techmically, there is a in game option, it's under the custom exchange tab (button at the bottom right of the buy gem screen) HOWEVER it uses gold to gems rather than RL money to gems.  If you have the gold, you just type 2000 in the custom exchange screen on the right side.

Holosmiths are really good in PvP and PvE but are usually a **pure** DPS-class. So you need to compete with other DDs for raidspots or a place in fractal pugs.

Really, it only is because elite specs dropped at the same time as Rev and they wanted it to seem like the class got an extra one
---
Well you are the commander. It was your actual rank. You weren't just A Commander of the Pact, but the first one. So yeah. It's not illogical.

as people mentioned yet, only the personal story is tailored to your char. the overworld-story is the more realistc one, but u could never do all that alone. group event bosses are way too strong. i'm fine with the NPCs calling me commander etc, since i've ran my feet literally off for completing it thaha.

I think the main issue is that everything looks identical. There are is little variation on a general design shape . Light armor: fitted tops and pants with buttcapes.

---
Can you tell me what those sandportals are? I see a mastery point on the map, but all there is is a sand portal.
---
Sandportals are for the jackal mount. The game is meant to be a process. The issue at least in part is that you're interested in getting your elite spec as an end in and of itself. But if you play the game organically a lot of this stuff solves itself. It's only when you want to get this specific thing done that you run into issues. 
---
For example you need zone currency to farm mounts. There are enough mastery points to get to train the base mount up, without doing the ones you can't do. If you can't do something mentally mark it and come back to it. You're not really meant to have the elite spec long before you do everything else...even if a lot of people want it. It's one of the two forms of progression. It pretty much replaces leveling in other MMOs.
---
Honestly, don't want to be rude or anything, but what you wrote in the first paragraph, it sounds like the classic case of 'git gud'. A lot (more likely all of it actually) of it can be explained, but I'll leave it to someone else because I am far too lazy for that.

Okay keep in mind even stories require progression. For example, in the HoT stories, you need gliding to get through one story. Jumping mushrooms to get through another. Updraft use to get through another. It's also a progression. You can't JUST focus on story instances. Half the story is in the zones themselves. 
---
My favorite way to play this game and probably the way it was designed is to play it holostically. Figure out the stuff you can do and do it, which will give you what you need to do the next thing. It's sort of structured like old fashioned adventure games.
---
If you're leveling masteries don't forget to use buffs. Guild buffs. Food. Utilities. Banners if you can find one. Celebration boosters from log in rewards. 
---
Also don't forget about bonus experience. Creatures left alive in the world a long time accrue greater bonus, so killing them with buffs is one of the fastest ways to level and should supplement doing events and story. If you kill something and notice it has high bonus experience kill everything in the area. It will greatly increase the speed at which you earn masteries.
---
Good luck!

Crafting the insignia in order to stat swap costs about 6G and an anthology per piece. Taking medium headpiece as the example the cheapest ([according to GW2efficiancy](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/ascended?filter.type=0&amp;filter.subtype=Helm&amp;filter.weight_class=medium) and not including season only magic items or the legendary) is Ferratus's Visage (Rabid stats) at 37g94s. Making Harrier stats would be Zehtuka's Visage at 42g85s, a difference of 4g95s. Making stat swapping not worth the amount saved. It should be noted as well that the Fractal/PvP armor is cheaper overall at 32g83s for the head. You can see[ more gearing info here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character#But_what_about_ascended_armor.3F) specifically on the ascended armor table.
---
I will also say that at least for raids I suggest people use the raid collection set to get the full harrier armor to save on cost and annoyance in crafting it all since exotic harriers are a waste of money. If you want to gear for now I would really suggest just using Magi exotics for now and swapping over as you get the gear. Fractals can be done all the way into half of tier 3 with just accessories and no ascended armor or weapons. 
---
What's the meta comp for Fractal 42?
---
Basically the class is the style/theme. You can build every class into a support type by just choosing their support-based traits and equipping gear that increases buff duration, etc
---
Thank you very much! It's very helpful.
---
Banned from tumblr.
---
thank you for breaking it down with the cost! :)
---
im planning on playing druid in raids, but will people accept a druid still using magi armor? i could also do pDPS on my ranger and then get the harrier with the collection? or the other way around? 
---
alright. will people usually require ascended armor in raids or will i do okay with exotic? then i could start getting the gorseval kills at least
---
thank you for all the assistance! :)
---
There's an underwater tunnel near that area that heads to [Quaggankeep Channel].  The noise is ambient music for the hidden quaggan village, looks like the trigger is just a little generous.
---
I also love being a lesser played prof
---
That's not Ana, is it? God, I hope that's not Ana.
---
You can actually get to the jackal with base skimmer or springer. Skimmer is hard to pull off without the upgrade and and takes some luck but springer is super easy. Just follow the walkway that leads up to the stairs and ledge under the jackal heart, jump once on springer to get close and again to get up the ledge. [Dulfy does have a mastery list](http://dulfy.net/2017/09/26/gw2-path-of-fire-mastery-insights-guide/#Sorted_by_Mount_Mastery) for when you want more and GW2Efficiancy can show you [all the achievement mastery points](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/achievements?filter.display=available-points&amp;filter.masteriesOnly=Desert) you are missing.
---
Does it scale up well into super hard content or is it more of an open-world faceroll?
---
hmm do you know anywhere that has a guide of how to get it with base springer?
---
Recently heard about Fractal 42 being used as a repeatable gold farm. How does one set this up? What's the meta group comp for this, and how do I find other players?
---
You could solo some dungeon paths and low tier fractals if you are really good. Other than that what are you considering soloing ?
---
I liked EotM: PvE with some occasional PvP. Plus, I loved not being tied to a server and the game spawning additional matches based on the number of players there. I'd also like having the PvP gear system.
---

---
It's not great in pve, but it's an absolute blast in pvp/wvw!
---
Thief has been my mine main since day 1, and (almost) never had a problem. And with the daredevil spec, even better.
---
With the trait that alow you to heal with every crit, you can faceroll (well, just press 1 and let the staff auto do the job) 80% of enemies, blind (staff 4) is another gem (people usually get mad with vines in HoT areas, with thief you just blind them &gt; auto &gt; blind them again when they attack). Staff 3 and 5 allow you to evade and do dmg. (and area combos). Also, 3 dodges.
---
Plus, thief can change his style for whatever you need.
---
Need CC? done. 
---
Need some buddies for a burst? done (up to 4 npcs). 
---
Need high dps or condi dmg? done. 
---
Need to grab that thing in the middle of 30 enemies? P-P-P-Perma invi fuckers
---
Need high mobility? Hell yeah (you should watch me getting the hell out of a figth in mvm, while I´m capping things to get pips, with my pve build lol &gt; short bow 5, 3 dodges, heal that give you more dodges, shadowstep, then invi, can´t touch this)
---
You can see it done [here](https://youtu.be/yEEsIi-mbN8?t=55s) but I am now remembering that you need one of the tier 3 masteries unlocked on skimmer OR springer before they will let you buy jackal. Also make sure you buy the jackal with the heart completed as the price goes up if it's not.
---
I mean it can give alacrity, if it chooses to take the Ventari path and pick serene rejuvenation, the problem is that they gave a better version to Renegade. The problem with Herald is that many of the buffs Herald can give, Renegades can give (possibly better) and plus more. The only thing that makes Heralds unique is Facet of Nature granting Boon duration, which was nerfed back in October 16 when it comes to amount(50 &gt; 33), and buffed in October 18 when it comes to cost (3 tick &gt; 2 tick)
---
ok, i heard the skimmer is better to lvl to mastery 3 for it, is that true?
---
Blast it with f1 skill for more healing, leap through the combofield/blast it for even more healing. You're really supposed to blast it, though. 
---
There is nothing polished about necro too. Get in the line.
---
Maybe mystic curios, though the issue I see is that gw2efficiency says eureka requires 26400 elder wood and the wiki states it's 18300. Similarly large discrepancy for mithril.
---
Staff? I played viper staff mirage a little and it was really hard to die 
---
War is blobbing.
---
[Here you go.](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vlAQNAV5nnfNWMTuJvmRHlZzskytZ4SZ3Mor8bmFUliNJeio4fETxWMNAKgEA-jBSFQBjUJoS2fQgXAgGq8DAHBg+p+T70NggHCQAgDACQ8IFAMj2A-e) 
---
1shot ranger/mesmer/thief in roaming and fb+scg+rev ranged damage with fb support in blob will still be there.
---
that files are from autobuild, you don't need them really, but you right, need to autoremove them in autobuild =]
---
Most/all dungeon paths as needed and possibly some low to mid-tier fractals.
---
Nice! Stuff like this adds depth to the game. Careful though, I once posted one trick on official forums and some time later the cast times were tuned in a way it no longer worked. Though it was probably coincidence
---
Fucking useless Zerg player doesn't know how to micro properly.
---
Imagine wvw being just big landscape for fights and everyone is on their own.
---
You can join a guild and then all its members will become your ally and will show in green tag name now.
---
If you kill an ally it will be considered as pk and you will have bounty on your head that people can kill you and claim. Bounty decided by how many pk you've done.
---
You lose a wvw rank if you pk and then get killed.
---
Guilds can claim structures by storming them with large number of people and killing lords and other people in them be it solo players or other guilds as killing lord for solo player will be difficult.
---
This will increase initiative for people to join guilds and people who are foreveralone can also play as solo players but they have to be skilled enough to survive in the jungle where everyone is preying on you.
---
This is kind of buttclench mode wvw should be which promotes high rewards for greater achievements be it pking everyone and still not getting killed even if whole server is coming to get your bounty or making a big guild and dominating others untill others also form guild and compete with you.
---
Pk'ers cannot join guild untill bounty is removed from their head.
---
There will be server wide points for claiming structures but there will be personal reward too for your contribution aside from reward tracks.
---
Top guilds/people who give most contribution to server wide points will also recieve some sort of special rewards. 
---
This is the kind of mode i imagine when i think about wvw. I know it wont be implemented, its just a fantasy.
---
Not having to walk everyhere? Wtf. Takes so long and is so boring. 
---
&gt; nails
---
I see what you did there
---
Thief is not a class you can you can do that with. It took me a long time to get proficient with Thief to the point where I'm not dying in Zergs in WvW all the time.
---
I do recommend Spellbreaker though
---
Let's see what happens. I didn't think it was such a bad campaign the last time. Besides the controversy the actual videos were done very respectfully and sweet. Why not share some positivity? 
---
You can also try using AED or Coolant Blast, as turret relies on Water field a bit and that may not always work in groups on clutch situations. 
---
Also maybe run Sword + Shield for the blocks. If you are still having problems, run the no-kit Holo build, which is easy to play and has Photon Wall for even more blocks.
---
What? 
---
No need to use the F1 skill before the blast now. When deploying, it will overcharge to use cleansing burst (not immediately, but its really quick). You then just detonate.
---
Just means you can hang onto the F1 regen later.
---
My situation is quite similar to yours. I have carpal tunnel on both hands which impairs my ability to play. In my experience, power reaper minion master is the easiest to play (less fatigue and less pain in my hands). I use full zerker with strength runes, gs/axe+warhorn. At 20k HP I almost never die and if I am downed I just use skill 1 to leech off my enemies. I was considering marauder for harder content (like HoT HPs) but ultimately decided against it since I can solo most of the HPs in zerker (it is not a swift and glorious win, it is a war of attrition :) ).
---
Mirage is a bit too hard to play for an extended time since one needs to spam shuttering skills (F1-F4) and dodge quite often. However, with full Pahua the survivability is very good.
---
I also enjoy flamethrower engineer for zerg activities. My favourite setup is a full wanderer with durability runes. The gameplay is somewhat similar to minion master except the turrets are stationary. An additional bonus is that flamethrower does not need to be recharged unlike shroud and can be used almost exclusively in auto-attack mode. Wanderer with durability runes provides enough toughness and HP to survive with almost non-existent dodging skills. Unfortunately, the damage is a bit low, so this build is not very solo-friendly.
---
I played GW2 a year ago, I barely hit max level and got to T3 fractals. I'm no where into endgame, Im slowly getting ascended gear. I have no clue what to do on the game besides daily fractals and repeat
---
Pikies!

uRgE tO kIlL rIsInG

Switch to another another borderland before the timer hits zero and you do get ticks (or is that just for reward tracks?)
---
I'll be glad to answer you fellow rando :)))
---
5k hours, Envoy's Herald, 250LD, 25k ap min and GWAMM
---
Pick a point on map, travel there, see what is happening, join them. 
---
I mean, this would be really cute if it went the way they said. But the whole thing was a lotta crap. There was a lot of people who submitted their very beautiful stories, but instead of actually showcasing the great relationships that were made in the game. All of the videos were actually just of actors who simply recited a script. The whole thing was a bunch of baloney.
---
* If you're low health, don't overheat
---
* Use Photon Forge 5 to knockdown enemies in a big radius
---
* Use the Hard Light Arena's toolbelt skill to pull enemies together (another CC)
---
* Use the arena for protection
---
* Use Photon Wall for blocks
---
* Try making use of AED's clutch heal (bonus points if triggered with your own overheat)
---
* Generally, kill things as fast as possible
---
You can also farm aetherblade; start with skips - fast to cannon room, there pull all the mobs and kill them stacked, faster you do this faster you get to the final part. next thing is to run around the lazor walls for couple of seconds and repeat.
---
thanks a lot! 
---
ill be aiming for exotic armor and ascended trinkets 
---
Its fun killing other player, i don't care about the rewards and all the goofy shit. ITS ALL ABOUT THE FIGHTS. (Full time roamer)
---
Sometimes during non peak hours I get matched with ranked first timers who do not know how to play and I'm plat, it makes me want to cry
---
anet marketing monkeys don't know when to stop and they repeat the worst campaigns again
---
Thanks for the video. I use beetle all the time kn race. I think i've only lost (not coming in first) 3 or 4 times. I only could get 2 full laps in consistently though.
---
I wish I could say no but yes, it is dead.
---
Anet does the bare minimum for pvp. The meta is disgusting and stale. It’s a no from me dog
---
I don't want anet to find out cuz they might "fix" it, but...you can use the latest mount mastery to achieve that.
---
Awww thanks! That's one of the reasons I dont feel like Rytlock. My voice is not that rough and deep. But hey, Steve Blum is Steve Blum!
---
Next week I do the whole! ^^ &lt;3
---
Boring ass mode with no point at all, mass pvping with blobs is boring and have no meaning, guilds with non existing rivalries too, u cant talk shit(banter(lol noob u died get good)) to players u kill which makes it even more boring and even less rivalry nobody have time to block someone to find out their name.
---
Just remove wvw and put on open world pvp
---
Nah that's Jade Harley.
---
Revenant is my favorite class and I love it to death, but it does have its flaws. There are three primary things I would like introduced for the core class:
---
-1 to 2 additional utility skills per legend (this would include Glint and Kalla too, so 1 would be more realistic).
---
-A defensive/utility-based offhand. Since offhand sword no longer blocks, we now only have offensive offhand weapons for the core class.
---
-An F2 skill that changes based on the two legends you have chosen.
---
Actually there is a fourth thing:
---
-A REZ TRAIT! We are now the only class without one. Why remove it and not implement it somewhere else? Salvation is the perfect fit.
---
Beyond that I would like for the legends and certain traits to get some polish. In particular I would like to see Ventari become more reactive with a lower cooldown on its movement skill, a shorter delay on Natural Harmony, and a radius increase on its skills. 
---
Thanks, can you elaborate what you mean? I don't quite understand.
---
yeah, 3 target cleave is so good! /s
---
Dodge is an aoe, Skill 5 is an aoe, élite is an aoe
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** wobbleone! ^(hug)
---
What meta are you talking about? You need to make that clear since if it is something like PvE then condition renegade remains very relevant on a number of challenging encounters. 
---
thank you for posting the truth!
---
(I couldnt find the link anymore)
---
I am not wanking off to anything, dumb ass. the reactions and the behaviour of some ppl last time was straight up disgusting. period.
---
I dont need superior intellect or higher morality to see that. nobody does.
---
Pretty much the same, throw in a couple of afk's and bots (well bots are only gold level, so you shouldn't see them), bots that anet refuses to ban for some reason, even though they were exposed multiple times on the official forum, must be some big whales I guess?
---
Still inferior to other meta classes lol but alright, have fun cleaving with dodges
---
When you glide back from sabetha canon and kill yourself.
---
ah cool thnx for clarifying and your work its really nice to have less fps drops
---
It was my first time back to fractals after a few years. I tried tier 1 with my guild mates and I went down a lot. Especially the twilight one where they had the princess amala? Gosh that was a pain in the ass.
---
If you are a active WvW player it should not be a problem at all. Paricipation is not hard to get if you actively play WvW.
---
Well you can buy 1600 and then add 400 buy using in game gold and exchange. I mean you could do it with the whole 2000 as well of course but i think you get my point.
---
Oh wow, thanks. That's a massive amount of wood and mithril saved. Mainly wood. I remember when elder wood was little more than vendor trash...
---
Mesmer.
---
You want to join Tarnished Coast for NA and Piken Square for EU. (Yes, server choice does matter and you want to be sorted to the RP shard.) The website for RPers is guildwars2roleplayers.com :3
---
You can get one per character, because it is tied to map completion.
---
You need grandmaster marks to buy ascended version of unlocked exotic armor pieces from the reward track. Grandmaster marks is the most hated thing in game for me. You need to be lvl500 in crafting discipline to craft these marks that too of their own kind. So basically you need crafting lvl500 of various discipline to get all kinds of grandmaster marks on top of wvw currencies to buy ascended items. There is no avoiding leveling crafting and that sucks for people like me.
---
Uh what armor is that? Looks amazing.
---
You get Grandmaster barks from the PIP chests, it's not fast recieving but not very slow either.
---
Cdkeys is not official retailer. Dont buy from there for the love of god.
---
Male cloth really is lacking compared to many of the female versions, yep. In a lot of cases it'd just look better if the female look was just slightly modified; instead, it's just bunchy at the waist (even worse on Sylvari) and the boots usually suck.
---
I've put together a few really nice combos, but you have to work for it.
---
The class was severely improved however, both in gameplay and damage. 
---
Firstly I never agreed with the fact that reaper has one single grandmaster that can turn that spec into condi damage. Makes no sense that trait should be gone already. Every other trait in reaper is about sustain cc or damage. 
---
No more you spam GS#2 forever once below 50%, thanks to the trait Soul Barbs and major buffs to Soul Spiral and the Reaper AA you wanna now constantly switch between reaper and GS to maintain that buff. 
---
And finally, we're no longer in a position where power reaper is considered a troll pick for raids or whatever. In fractals that shit is god tier in pugs because it can maintain 25 might and quickness on it's own. In raids, yes its a little undesirable but in fights like CA for instance it's really good. Because all the dmg you do is cleave, you can dps the boss as hard as you dps adds. This is also good for sloth or KC for instance. 
---
I think reaper its fine now. Given its sustain and damage + cc, i think the dps numbers are fair. You're not kicked if you join a raid with it, you won't get the fastest kill but you sure will have a save one (if you don't suck that is). 
---
I recall seeing lvl 84 monsters before. Don't know which ones, but I swear I've seen them.
---
I really enjoy rev but I feel it would of been better if it didnt have wep swap and had stronger wep skills
---
Oboy this is just mindblowing. Did you miss the fact that a at least 10 people either stopped or run away from the person being attacked? I mean watch it again and see all of them moving, some are then stopping when he single out a player and the rest just run off and he keep on doing it even stop and watching thinking wtf. 
---
And you make this about Gandara? 
---
it brob starts with a cowapult.
---
I actually like the idea of a soft cap, like black desert does. But, with the mastery system already in place, there's just no reason to ever raise the level cap from 80 to 100.
---
WvW is a player organized mass pvp. Regardless of their skill level,  most players seek massive fights since more players killed, more loot drops. It's also more fun for guilds to organize fights in between.
---
Problem is, guild vs guild needs an organization at players part. Which shouldn't be the case. Second problem is, while players seek big fights, they tend to gather at certain servers. Two basic factors, which makes wvw unique and fun creates their own problems since neither one of them was solved by Anet since launch.
---
Alliance solution is potentially good for server hopping problem. I was against it when they announced it 2 years ago (yes it's been almost 2 years since then) because it'd mean losing non guild friends of mine. But it's not a problem anymore. Everyone is gone already.
---
If someone wants to play a tanky guardian and nothing else, they should at least build for minstrel so they can be somewhat useful to groups by giving out boons and heals.
---
Join a serious WvW guild, it's what got me in there. When I say serious, I mean SERIOUS, like if you die too much in skirmishes and don't improve you get chewed out and humiliated in front on the guild, or you get booted. If you're on during a run you're expected to be with the guild or get kicked. And most real WvW guilds have their own secret non meta builds for team comps that you have to follow to fit the commanders play style.   
---
After I joined a guild that existed only for WvW, I fell in love with the game mode. It wasn't about loot, it wasn't about objectives, it was about dominating our rival guilds with 20-25 players a night, It was about destroying 50+ zergs with a small zerg buster comp, it was about being elite. Foreal, join a hardcore guild.
---
Mann, I love to [Prime Light Beam] when that happens.
---
Adding GetRenderState fixed almost all of issues, but anyway i added fixes for imgui too.
---
So binary release is up on github [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases/tag/v0.9.6a](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases/tag/v0.9.6a)
---
of course not. The only outfits I got are the wedding dress and the ones you got for free or promotional ones.  
---
That said I am currently not even playing the game. 
---
Cdkeys sell them at a good price and I’ve bought probabaly over 20000 gems from them, had no problem what so ever
---
That's a bold move, it won't be easy to top abusive friendzoning in the pilot episode.
---
Still, good luck to this year's competitors, can't wait for the second episode!
---
Honestly, there are several issues I have with revenant. I personally feel like there is no other class in the game which experiences such a huge lack of love. (Yes im aswell looking at you, reapers!)
---
**Lack of weapons**
---
One of the issues is that revenant wasnt designed with two weapon sets in mind since they get an additional skillset due to their two legends. However, unlike ele (4) and engi (1+n, toolbelt + kits), that simply doesnt cut it, so they added a second weapon set. However, rev simply doesnt have the weapon count to support such a system. You cant really mix and match most of the weapons as they are clear cut dedicated to one build direction. Be it ranged/melee or condi/power/healing.
---
So the proposed solution would be to add another few MH and OH weapons to exisiting core legends. For example:
---
Jalis = OH Torch or MH Scepter
---
Ventari = MH Scepter or OH Focus
---
Mallyx = MH Axe
---
Shiro = OH Dagger, OH pistol or rifle
---
Having more weapons means there is actually more space for mixing a matching.
---
Furthermore, I'd personally hate it if ANet were to add yet another twohanded weapon with the next espec. Id rather like to see something like MH+OH pistol or dagger.
---
**Lack of synergy &amp; utilities**
---
Most legends and their traitlines are dedicated to one specific aspect, means wanting some specific mechanic will force you into taking a traitline or legend you actually dont want as traitlines and legends dont offer alot of synergy aspects and are therefore hard to mix. Best example for this is probably condi cleanse. If you want access to it, you are forced to use mallyx or corruption. Otherwise you have to fully rely on Cleansing Channel (Invocation), staff 4 or your sigil/rune which isnt even closly enough and forces you in things you actually dont want to take. Im not even mentioning shield here as it is a clusterfk. 
---
The other thing is that, due to the lack of weapon and utility skills, skills itself need to be kinda restrictive. What I mean by this is simple: Rev skills already try to be the best out of different worlds, as the ability to mix&amp;match is completely missing. As a result skills try to do alot, but can only do it in a toned down, mediocre way. The solution is yet again to add more skills, increasing the value of what one skill does while offering an actual alternative in form of another skill. This could be archived by adding like 2-3 new utility skills per legend, maybe even a second heal and/or elite.
---
Furthermore, to maybe jump on the synergy aspect again. Taking retribution, and even worse, salvation most of the time feels like a huge cut to what you can do, especially when playing DPS as the tradeoffs are way to high. Especially salvation feels hard locked into ventari. Giving more cross legend/traitline synergies would make the whole approach feel less trash. Best example at this point is "**ICE**razors Ire" applying cripple instead of chill, loosing out on a possible great synergy with Abyssal Chill of corruption...
---
**Energy**
---
Just to have it mentioned here, energy feels like a weird mechanic. From a class design point, it doesnt make sense to lock weapon skills into the energy system as energy is actually hard bound to legends. Swapping legends refreshs your energy, as a result, I personally feel like only legend skills should consume energy at all. This would aswell fix the issues of revs being completely dumbstered when dropping to near zero as weapon skills would still be useable. Yes, granted, this is a huge aspect of playing rev "well", managing your energy, but having weapon skills consume energy simply feels weird in the first place. I could even live with a slight cooldown increase.
---
TLDR: When only looking at numbers and performance, rev seems perfectly fine. They perform super well in raids, wvw and pvp. But performance isnt the point at all but: They **FEEL** wrong when playing. Most of it comes down to the energy system and missing buildcraft/diversity plus trashy, not too well thought out mechanics like kalla spirits and ventar-iPad. **The whole class feels rushed**.
---
Where did you get this OP?
---
"I am trying to politely explain my point of view" seems a bit at odds with "you can't complain if people kick you". 
---
I think you were patronising, partly because you assumed someone was wrong for not using a build off the internet. Unless you said "I think we need more DPS for this, can we quickly check our builds" or something in party chat, it looks like you just kicked them. That's not teamwork or cooperation, that's throwing a tantrum because you didn't get the thing you didn't say you wanted. 
---
Metabattle isn't default, it's efficient assuming a perfect team composition. Sometimes you need more survivability, and that's fine. You're not dealing with timers in fractals like you do in raids. Chill the funk out. 
---
There is a compromise bewteen a total random build and an optimal build, it seems that many can't understand it. Sorry if i don't want to spend 40mins instead of 10 mins for subject 6 (wiped 4 times), i don't have all time i want, when i do i don't complain about builds. 
---
I am not saying that the party is made of 4 pros and a noob. Everyone makes mistake, and i never define myself like a pro player. But what options does the party have when you can't overcome and obstacle? It's not about carring or being carryed, it's about party requirments, expecially in t3 where almost all of the builds are far from optimum. 
---
Indeed, it depends on the kind of LFG that was set up when people joined. Kicking such people is fine when the LFG made clear that meta is what the group (opener) expects. It is wrong when the LFG did not indicate such a thing. People both have to state what they want **and** to read/understand what others want.
---
do what u want cuz a Pirat is free! Welcome to gw ! :))
---
&gt; When I say serious, I mean SERIOUS, like if you die too much in skirmishes and don't improve you get chewed out and humiliated in front on the guild, or you get booted.
---
Sounds like a great way to spend my leisure time!
---
We’ve adopted mega man battle network chip Tier lingo somehow.

Thief is quite good. A bit squishy, but when you get the élite specialization daredevil you'll have three dodges
---
I agree with this but to a point were it also have to be resonable. If there is this one guy who join and just dies as soon as he is up and this just keep on going and it is very clear he have no clue nor do he listen to explanations or the help he been given. In that case i would leave the group but if someone put up a vote i would vote yes without a doubt. 
---
I have no issues with helping people or explain or baby sit them if i play support this is all fine as long as we are progressing and people are trying. But beyond that i also have the right to decide if i want to dedicate hours to teach someone who do not care and just want to be carried or if i leave or vote the person off.
---
It's February already! Nice.
---
Let me start by saying,
---
This thread made my night. On a more serious note, some of the predictions here are entirely in line with ANET  balancing policy. I’d know, I got terminated, for suggesting some staff members get fired after botched balance patch. Anet is so disconnected from reality and their community, that all those jokes actually sounds like valid and completely plausible patch notes. Good Job AnusNet! #clap
---
Relevant bit about **weapon types**:
---
**Mike Zadorojny, Game Director**: We have nothing against the idea of introducing new weapon types. When we talk about elite specializations and what additional weapons we want to make classes available, there's a balance we're trying to achieve. So far, we've been able to add value to each class based on the weapons we've chosen. Making weapons accessible that are already available in Guild Wars 2 has unlocked a wide variety of skins that we already have in the game.
---
Nevertheless, the idea of completely new weapon types or converted underwater weapons is something that has come up in previous discussions about class specializations.
---
Relevant bit about **Zojja**:
---
**Linsey Murdock, Design Lead**: Zojja was badly wounded in the fight against Mordremoth. The rotting capsules have attacked the greatest strengths of Logan and Zojja. For Logan it was his physical talent, but for Zojja it was her mind. Traumatic brain injuries can lead to a long healing process and often have ongoing negative effects. I think Zojja's loved ones want to protect her from the ongoing conflict so she can concentrate on her recovery.
---
Oh and MikeZ emphasized **why there's no official DPS meter**:
---
**Mike Zadorojny, Game Director**: A DPS Meter is not something most players need to have fun with Guild Wars 2. We wanted to respect the needs of dedicated players who want to push themselves to their limits, and give them a tool that gives them freedom to test new builds. The DPS Golem was created just for that.
---
I wish we could build jumppads to glide and throw bombs to the enemy zerg from above, or shoot enemy gliders down. I have always been fascinated by the aerial battles in wars.
---
Probably not. It seems to be empty most of the time.
---
Why don't they make it an ingame event? Id love to see a new event based on friendship, love and maybe family. An Asura/Charr making a love/friendship potion that goes out of hand and we need to clean up the mess.
---
No, its not. There is still people playing. I have no trouble getting matches. Even outside of prime time. You might get teamed with lower or higher ranked players.
---
[Lots of awkward handwaving](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Primordus#Trivia).
---
Amala is a fight with very little damage that you have to eat once you know the patterns. Before that point, however, she's one of the most painful bosses. Just observe and learn.
---
No matter what I tried, I couldn't get it to work with arc, renamed dx12 do d3d9\_chainload.dll, removed buildtemplates, and other arc addons, but no luck, all crash before character select screen. Latest arc version. Without arc it works fine. Any tips?
---
git gud...
---
I did it the HoT way, is the funerary incense that much worse compared to crystaline ingots? All I know is that they were time gated
---
It needs updated version of ArcDPS.
---
Thx a lot for getting out Version 1.8.5
---
It worked quit nice, but it crashed after account 19. After restart, all set Accounts where gone from the program. I have local.dat files for eacht account saved in a different folder, can i input it anyhow in the launchbuddy? It would save a lot of work.
---
I'm using the latest arc. Let me try a clean install of arc and see if it helps.
---
You should probably try and see by yourself no?
---
I don't want to be mean but you clearly own the game and therefore don't have to buy anything...
---
Just log in and play? If you don't like it, stop. If you enjoy, keep playing? 
---
I don't really see the point of your post tbh, you'll get the usual answers of 5 people saying yes and 5 others saying no...
---
If it were actually subjectively fun for me.Here's why it isn't in one setence: Being in an amorphous sea of people following around a doritto and capping arbitrary points for rewards just doesn't do it for me.
---
* First of all I don't like being another faceless grunt in the zerg and I like to see my own personal impact in the fight. Now that's more easily quantifiable as a support player, because I can measure my impact by how resilient my individual group mates are or whether or not I've saved some individual from death, but as DPS... 3K damage pop-up on some rando, massive flood of numbers on my screen, 0 meaning, 0 impact, they die, we win but I don't feel like I've done much of anything. And winning or losing doesn't impact me in the slightest because there's nothing at stake other than the time investment.  
---
* **Commanders**. Less of a tactician role, more of a social wrangling role. Good commanders, *I feel*, are social, personable people that can play their toon well and have some know-how about what it is that their group is supposed to be doing. If WvW were something that took more tactical depth than "they're capping X, we're on Y, a couple people stay here to cap and the rest let's rush them and kill them cause one of the scouts said they're fewer than us". I personally, am a bit of a curmudgeon for me tagging up brings with it a bit of anxiety because even though I'm aware of the personal responsibility of success or failure of a given endeavour I ultimately feel the responsibility should be a shared burden. Bit of cognitive dissonance on my part if you will.  
---
* Again, **the arbitrariness**. WvW, *I feel*, isn't well-defined in-lore. Technically anything is possible in the mists and various groups are following their own interests and therein lies the conflict that arises and that's WvW in a nutshell. Yea, no, I feel that's lazy writing. For me personally there would be a greater incentive to play WvW if the game mode had an actual stated goal other than PWN N00BS GIT LEWTZ.  
---
* **The rewards**. Personal rewards I'm just fine with, and are at the very least satisfactory. You can, with a bit of time invested, get some neat looking cosmetic upgrade or some other bits and bobs. At least it's some sort of progression however lackluster it might be. But what I would personally like is to show-off that time I invested playing WvW just like I can with PvE.  
---
* PvP **just**. **doesn't**. **do it**. **for me**. There you go. I've committed apostasy in the eyes of competitive E-sports. I play League of Legends and I'm a hypocrite. I took a firm leap off the altar of greatness and into the depths of casual scrubdom. I'm a PvE nerd, I like my encounters to have meaning and I don't derive meaning from conflict manufactured just for the love of conflict (even though someone might argue that a game, being fiction, **IS** manufactured conflict for the purposes of entertainment). PvP for me holds very little interest, for all of the reasons mentioned above and because I don't enjoy doing things just for the sake of competition. I guess I'm not really the target audience of WvW.
---
So my suggestions?   
---
1. A-Net should give some context as to why we're fighting. A bit of creative writing could go a long way.
---
2. Implement a system that that commanders can tactically use to make decisions and plan their battles, that has visible impact and enable them to use those big beautiful brains I know they have.
---
3. More personal relevancy by way of either a system where the game acknowledges your contribution such as chevrons earned for killing the enemy or some doodad that shows off how good of a healer/support player you are or personal goals to hit in a session, 500k healed, dps meters, whatever, I wanna see how I rank in this particular group I'm in and in what area I need to develop my skills.
---
4. Loss actually being a loss. Some negative server-wide effects (within reason) could go a long way to quell the indifference about the game-mode. Don't want -5% gold dropped or 5% chance to ruin a resource when gathering? Better sign up for WvW.
---
TL;DR. I think WvW is a bit arbitrary and irrelevant. It would be less-so with an emphasis on personal contribution and a more tactical approach to fighting and more impactful server-wide rewards be they positive or negative.
---
Been waiting more than half a year for a backpiece now, you never know with anet
---
Oh damn that's a bit discouraging. I don't want to play a thief with a staff. Sounds dumb lol
---
250 years of gobbling magic will do that to ya.
---
also, we *do* see Ol' Mordymoo.
---
Exactly!
---
Which dungeons do you recommend for gold farming? 
---
Dont boost any character at the moment. First get to lv 80 so you get the feel for the game. Journey to 80 will also help you understand your class a bit better.
---
Oh, my bad.
---
it's a command line argument.
---
right-click on your GW2 shortcut on the desktop and copy it. right click the copy, rename it GW2 Repair (or GW2 Fix this shit, whatever suits your fancy).
---
*then* right click on the renamed copy and click Properties. find "Target:". at the very end of that line, type -repair. the now renamed copy should be a client repair instead of the regular launcher.
---
repair usually takes a long time as it's a bigger game, and it checks *every* file. make sure you let it finish doing what it's doing. it may look like it's stalling out on you, but that's normal.
---
good luck!
---
*looks at Scrapper*
---
Technically the entire Maguuma Jungle is his body but yes, the Mouth of Mordremoth is his dragon body while the jungle itself and the seed inside Trehearne were the expansion of his mind.
---
I've been playing for about a month and am REALLY enjoying it. I played around with a few classes getting them to 30ish before deciding what I want to actually take to 80. I've also been watching WoodenPotatoes personal story let's play and his clearing of Ascalon Catacombs as a 45 warrior made me want to try on my 45 Thief.  
---
Last night I prepped similarly to how WP did with rare equipment, runes, and sigils. First attempt was this morning and I didn't get very far. I've been running a P/P power build with Sword/P for groups. However, I found my damage to be pretty lackluster and my sustainability and CC almost non-existent. 
---
Any professional thieves want to give me some pointers? I know this is going to take some practice but I am pretty disappointed with my first attempt. 
---
It's more like an extension than the actual body of Mordremoth. Basically if you look at the map of Maguuma, circle it - that's it, that's the dragon. You're welcome.
---
and fun!
---
I don't think you need to be afraid of humiliation to enjoy being competitive 
---
&gt;Aren't druid and holosmith basically necromancer?
---
No. Necromancer skills don't become more powerful the more lifeforce you have like how Holosmith sword/utilities get more bonuses the higher your heat. Necromancer also does not take damage for being in shroud too long. Forge can't be removed by taking too much damage unlike shroud. Celestial Avatar is not based upon damage done nor can be used at any time and requires you to fill it up by healing allies and changes the effects of glyphs.  
---
&gt;allow new types of upgrade components geared towards profession mechanics.
---
This would be *horrible* for balance. 
---
when strategy takes over your life 
---
Yeaaaah, I just keep forgetting that when not on my engineer, you're right. Like, I know it works this way now, but my memory refuses to accept it. 
---
They've gone over the top with dragon sizes, imo. Zhaitan was just right, having the size of a large airship. Everyone else is just fucking ridiculous.
---
Ok. Ow. :(
---
Yup.
---
If anyone does that dub I want to know.
---
The idea that Mordremoth targeted Logan on his physical habilities and Zojja on her mental because of theirstrenghs is new, if I haven't missed anything. And I quite like it.
---
Last time Anet did a statment of Zojja was Angel McCoy just before she left.
---
Two things:
---
1) If I wanna play necro in fractals am I fucked ?
---
2) Is there a way to get proper high heels on my char without an outfit ?
---
Interesting.  I suppose that I find some stuff about that part of the lore unclear, like in Domain of Vabbi don't you say that he died when he impaled his head on a tree?  I know we killed him for real when we destroyed his mind, though
---
It wouldve been stolen code or code bought from stolen credit card or fake credit card and most likely will get your account banned. If it didnt then its your luck.
---
Reason why you should play it:
---
1 - you never played it
---
2 - core game is free, has a ton of stuff to do
---
3 - not absurdly grindy like other MMOs
---
4 - doesn't hold you by the hand and tells you what to do, you're free to do your own thing most of the time
---
7 - combat is a mix of tab target and action, which was a nice change of pace for me when I first started
---
6 - ANet is very reasonable when it comes to monetizing the game
---
7 - no weekly/monthly server downtime when patches arrive
---
9 - you're not punished for exploring
---
10 - story is not stellar but it's certainly entertaining
---
11 - updates are pretty regular
---
12 - one of the most populated MMOs out there, you're never alone...
---
13 - ...and that's awesome because no stealing kills\* or resource nodes, events scale based on number of players, everyone gets loot
---
27 - quests are replaces with hearts, force no backtracking
---
28 - the absolute best art design I ever seen in any game, it's like you're playing inside a painting
---
There you go, 50 reasons why I think this game is at least worth your time.
---
Okay, wall of text incoming.
---
I've always liked the idea of MMOs but I've never actually really loved an MMO before.   I love the idea of big sweeping worlds and playing with other people, but I hate the way a lot of MMOs make the open world a competitive experience rather than a cooperative one.
---
This game changed a lot of that. No kill stealing, no node stealing. Everyone can rez everyone else without wasting a skill slot. No fights over dungeon or raid loot since everyone gets their own loot. 
---
It's a great game for people who love the open world. That's what attracts me to this game.
---
A lot of the annoyances I have with other games don't exist here. Not to say there are no annoyances, they're just different from other games.
---
The combat system is fluid and better than other MMOs I've played. It's active combat rather than static combat. You can move while casting virtually every skill. 
---
There are awesome jumping puzzles (think Tombraider), there are big world bosses (think open world raids) and plenty of places to explore and find stuff many will never see. 
---
The game is also beautiful, with a lot of attention to detail. Some maps have amazing complexity. Lots of ambient dialogue, fully voices. Lots of fun tidbits I love to discover.
---
For a guy like me, there aren't many MMOs that can hold my attention long term, and I've tried a bunch of them.  Of course, your mileage may vary. 
---
The game is free. Try it out.  
---
Get used to being ignored then. Just confirms how relevant that server it is in wvw. If you get linked with them again I suggest you run away as far as possible. 
---
I don't plan to raid or do fractals, for now, as I'm still enjoying the game world and all it has to offer, but I plan to buy HoT in the future, maybe next month or the following one, I don't know.  
---
Would you suggest me to boost the current one, or to roll a new warrior and boost it?  
---
Would it change anything if it's a new one?  
---
Does the boost affect crafting skills or anything else?  
---
And which race would be best for a Warrior, in case I roll a new one?
---
2) Go to a bank or crafting station and look through the wardrobe, 99% of the available skins can be previewed there. I know that there are some skins with heels for light armor, not sure about medium/heavy.
---
Race doesn't matter. So play the one you like the look of most. Farming can be done by pretty much any class if you're good at it, but if mindless is what you're looking for an engineer with a flamethrower is where it's at. But you can get more money by just playing the harder content like fractals or raids. There it's personal preference.
---
You don't have to use staff on your daredevil...
---
The Deadeye playstyle is more akin to singling out a target and mercilessly hunting them down.  Daredevil on the other hand is about "gracefully" outmaneuvering a fight with extra dodges and dodge bonuses.
---
Deadeye typically does more DPS in PvE scenarios.
---
Deadeye and Daredevil just handle differently in WvW though fill similar niches.
---
Daredevil's mobility in sPVP is just superior in most cases.
---
I'm struggling with staying alive. I'm a level 80 weaver and even doing the path of fire quests where you go into the b it forged camp, I'm getting destroyed by anything that's ranged. What am I doing wrong? I have a small amount of sustain but the game is just bending me over backwards at this point, so much of it is a pain to solo. Am I just playing a class made out of paper? Do I need more gear? Am I just bad? 
---
Orr karma armour is still unsalvageable though, so if you ever make the mistake of putting expensive runes in thinking you can use a BL kit to get them out when switching to ascended, well, prepare for a big loss.
---
besides that, karma is nowhere near as easily accessible anymore than it used to be in the early days. winter's day is a good source as well as some ls4 maps with karmic retribution, but needs dedicated farming, while at the start of the game karma just came in from normal playing, so unless you have millions to spare and unlocked all the karma skins and minis (roughly 7 or 8 million overall I think, maybe more) I wouldn't recommend Orr armours at all, especially since core stat sets can be bought for like 1g a piece, are salvageable and overall just quicker to get.
---
Biggest tip I can give is to cc trash packs with holo 5, increased my survivability by a lot. As for bosses, just remember to utilise your toolbelt heal skill from the healing turret by comboing in the water field it generates. 
---
Other than that, learn the attack pattern of the given encounter and sidestep/dodge dmg - there are very few fractal bosses where you cant avoid pretty much all the dmg.
---
You're thinking of G2A.
---
I main a thief (deadeye) but I can say now, that the CC differences between the classes are immense. 
---
Remember you're more mobile than a warrior, and even without utility skills, certain weapons allow teleporting/shadowstepping.
---
Consider looking into Shortbow (for mobs or groups), D/D and/or D/P 
---
All 3. Do you have exotic gear at least? Have you tried kiting with staff? If you still have problems then take tempest, it's much easier, tankier while doing basically same damage.
---
Here are the highlights:
---
Robust, mostly very friendly and helpful community. 
---
Never really feels like a grind (unless you want to). You can max out your level just by exploring and doing various quests, but nothing like other MMOs where you’ll spend days in the same zone camping spawns or rerunning the same things again and again. 
---
End game gear is easily accessible. “Legendary” gear, which are the top level, have unique looks and animations and take a lot of time and/or money. Ascended gear has the exact same stats, and except for a few convenience factors like being able to change stats for free, serve the same purpose and are significantly easier to get. 
---
Most high level items are ACCOUNT bound, not character bound, so if you get something great you can share it between characters.
---
Constant update of content. 
---
There are regular events with some exciting and different things (right now is Lunar New Year, but they have a Halloween, a Wintersday, and an awesome 8-bit themed event that started as an April Fool’s Joke).
---
There are also regular updates to the story released at no charge that introduce new maps and new adventures.
---
There have been two expansions which introduce two huge mechanics (“gliding” like flight and mounts), but aren’t necessary to be competitive.
---
Lots of end game activities. There are raids, there are progressively  harder mini dungeons, there is “fashion wars” (to get the prettiest/most impressive armor and weapons).
---
Random stuff that may be fun for you. Mini games, adventures, jumping puzzles. I hate them, but some players love them and few other games have them.
---
Three supported distinct modes - PVE, PVP, and WVW. All of the PVE world is cooperative - no kill stealing because everyone who hits something gets credit for the kill, and all quests are tracked individually. PVP is structured in 5v5 teams with a number of different arenas. World vs World is a conquest style server vs server system with week long battles where three teams vie for control of various towers, keeps, camps, etc. lots to do there.
---
Caveat on PVP - there are a lot of toxic players in the PVP world, but PVP is its own mode entirely so you’d literally never encounter them unless you wanted.
---
Caveat on WVW - it doesn’t see a lot of attention these days from the devs, so new things are scant if ever and it’s mostly neglected. The players still love it though.
---
A lot of mechanic decisions make it stand out, too. As a design choice, they did away with the “trinity” concept by giving all characters access to significant healing powers. At end game you’ll need dedicated healer slots and tanks, but even the high level instances dungeons can be literally any assemblage of character types and still be successful. So you’re never forced to group if you want to play a healer type. 
---
Those are of some of the highlights. It’s designed for casual players with a ton of conveniences (map Travel is near instant and costs a token number of coins to spots you’ve “checked in” at before), but still has enough to get competing players interested.
---
If you have any questions, feel free to message me here.
---
Would be cool to get future maps where you have extreme hight differences like this. Shiverpeaks?
---
Short and long answer, no one knows. 
---
Citadel Black Lion.
---
You have to remember your mount (in this case the Griffon) has 4 skills...
---
1. Skill 1: Swoop, not needed for flying
---
2. Jump: Spacebar, used to flap your wings (usable at roughly 75% endurance, or maybe it's 80%)
---
3. Mount Ability 1: Dive (I have bound to V and Left-Shift for beetle drifting)
---
4. Mount Ability 2: Pull up (I have bound to R)
---
So what i'm doing is...
---
1. Jump off whatever i'm starting on (Spacebar)
---
2. Dive, Dive (V twice) to build up speed
---
3. Dive ends, Griffon starts moving forwards
---
4. quickly flap wings (Spacebar) then pull up as high as possible (R)
---
5. Once you reach as high as you can go flap wings (Spacebar)
---
6. Then repeat steps 2-5
---
Not really, power reaper and support scourge are in a good spot. You won't be taken in any more serious group due to class, but they ask for lots of kill proofs anyway (so your class doesn't matter at all at that point). 
---
there are levels to usboptimal builds and performance. what can and should be implied by any LFG unless otherwise specified is, that you can fill your role to a decent degree. a full nomad build that focuses purely on keeping yourself alive e.g. does not fill that criteria. gw2 players, or the minority of them i like to call "toxic casuals", tend to be so obsessed with their entitlement to individuality, that they forget that said entitlement is only applicable as long as it doesn't interfere negatively with the experience of others, who obviously are entitled to their own individuality. the stark difference is, that those "*non*-toxic casuals" have at least a basic sense of mutual respect in that regard, especially when it comes to *group* content.
---
Don't obsess over your vote total minutes after you post
---
I'd love to be able to play with existing friends. Reconstruction is a cool idea but based on the amount of information we're getting, it could be another year away. I'd love to see either sales, general price reduction, or free server transfers every 3-4 months. At least then I could play with friends or with my guild. 
---
I mean, the basically gave us spears in the latest release already. The tech is there, they just need to build our skills, animations, traits etc
---
Is deadeye good in PvP?
---
Now thats pure Friend/Ship content if I ever saw it
---
It's the latest update so I'm not sure man. Kind of sucks ass
---
There are reasons some people get stuck in t3...
---
WvW (World vs World) is your large scale, large battlefield, massive siege warfare type of gamemode.  It consists of 4 maps; of which 3 teams of players are pitted against each other in each map all trying to take various objectives (towers, keeps, and supply camps).  Fights can range from 1 vs 1's,  10 vs 10,  20 vs 40,  50 vs 50 etc.  There's no real rules here and if you like that "Battlefield-esque" type of gameplay you'd prefer this.
---
sPvP (Structured Player vs Player) is you 5 v 5 gametype.  All stats are normalized,  gear is unlocked,  you're auto-leveled to 80, etc.  It's all about skill here.  Players fight over 3 control points on a map and each map typically contains a neutral objective that changes how the game plays out.  Ex:  A 4th capture point that gives an increasing number of points each time it's capped,  or a map that contains a magical sword and shield that makes whoever caps these temporarily stronger.
---
There's nothing to regret. Train both specializations, try them out, and swap between them anytime out of combat. No build choices in this game are permanent
---
It's good in pvp no? I actually have no idea but I see it used a lot there at my level. 
---
Staff kiting helps and proper attunement management is very, very important for weaver. 
---
I tend to play S/D myself but:
---
It's a naturally squishy class, which when playing solo, means you have to be acutely aware of when you should be in your fire and lightning attunements for burst damage, and  water and earth for defensive and healing capabilities. That and proper dodging will take you far. 
---
Outside of that, make sure you know what your CC abilities are and be sure to know how to swap to them quickly when you need them. Most of them are in full lighting attunement which can be accessed quickly if you take the fresh air trait. 
---
Lastly, just know that weaver is a genuinely tough class that takes a lot of practice and micromanagement to get good at. If you're on NA servers, send me a message and we can run around together if you want in game help.
---
This is casual game, how dare players clear dungeons so fast? No loot for them.
---
- Anet
---
The girls chest is karma armor from kessex hills i belive, the other one is a bug that litterally hundreds of topics already mentioned :/
---
wvw= world vs world= huge maps with huge group fights or roaming. 
---
standard pvp= 5v5 with different objectives on different maps. 
---
Weaver is the most glass cannon you can get, especially with the weapon they give you. However you have ways to keep yourself alive. 
---
- Get a focus, you have projectile destroy on Air and Invuln on Earth
---
- Utility skill Arcane Shield saves your butt for the next few hits
---
- Twist of Fate gives you additional evade time
---
Now heres a thing. You are still a glass cannon. You can take your time and run away while these defenses are up and the enemy still runs after you and kills you. So use that nice damage you put out and while having your defenses up, kill all the stuff thats lethal to you.
---
They're still running it yes for the daily but I have not seen it being farmed at the same caliber as SW gets farmed since the nerf. I figured since Champ Bags weren't capped daily, folks would still be tagging up and farming Great Halls in between Palawadan Metas to get those bags at least but doesn't look that way fortunately. 
---
You monster!
---
Ok so I just googled about the different races and classes...what would you recommend?
---
How's the stability? The day it was released, it crashed after 10 minutes of WvW
---
Ok, but what would be your three go-to dungeons/paths to do fast and profitably?
---
EU/NA servers do matter though
---
Gw2 community 101 - I hate &lt;specific content&gt; but I'd kill to get the loot it provides, must play at all cause!
---
^(Responded to the wrong person accidentally lul)
---
Reaper is also old and slow, it's a perfect match.
---
hasn't messed with me and my compooper's a piece of crap.
---
sorry I couldn't be more help to ya, man.
---
I think it does prefer to put me into maps with other german people (at least so I've heard) and I want to change that.
---
That trait just brings problems. Allowing a spec to be both power and condi and whatever more is not a good design choice. Just look at the elite specs from PoF where they got rid of that almost entirely. You don't see condi spellbreaker or condi deadeye for instance. Reaper could be a condi spec solely because of that trait. Sure isn't now because it was nerfed into oblivion but is still there. Having a useless trait might as well not exist. 
---
You did spam GS2 for a very long time. Before the changes, going into shroud was a dps loss. The rotation consisted in Soul Spiral + GS Auto attacks and Axe. Below 50% you would spam ur wells (Well of corruption and GS4) and spam gravedigger. 
---
Being the worst dps class by 3K [dps](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) is hardly considered a bad thing. Yes not as good either but the gap is certaintly smaller. Reaper used to have 25k DPS with a way worse cancerous rotation. 
---
Having a simpler rotation also means you're much more likely to pull off the maxium potential of your class. I seriously recommend watching teapot's video on the matter where he joins 200LI+ groups and outdps everyone. 
---
Obvs in organized groups or static groups or smth, its worthless. But from a pure pugging perspective, it is viable. Also I don't know in which server you play but on EU i've seen many power reapers pugging. 
---
LOOOOOOL
---
Complete skill system split from other game modes and a revamp of shit tier classes to make them useful in large scale group fights.  
---
id say next time ask for something more specific, many kind of players do t3 and its not their fault you dont like their build
---
I'd say it depends on preference. Level 20 may be a bit too early to decide which you prefer since for some professions really benefit from traits or such later on.
---
But as the other comment said, I'd hold off on using the Level 80 Boost. Ideally, I'd say manually leveling one character to 80 is best since there is a fair bit of important information explained on level up and if you skip right to 80 you might miss some of it. But if you do boost, I'd at least wait until higher level (say 40-60) so you're a bit more experience. I'd also make sure to manually level a different character in the future to cover any level ups you missed from boosting.
---
But if you're unsure what character you'd want to boost, I'd say to take more time playing with the different professions and try new ones that sound interesting. As for race, that is more cosmetic but it does have some story impacts, mainly for the first 30 levels. So go with whatever you like the best.

This guy remembers a stupid hammer for 3 years but Jaw can't remember Overheating
---
the payment has went through
---
Care to elaborate?  
---
How does the ranger affect the speed and survivability, during grinding?
---
I play WvW a lot but only solo roaming, so to be fair I guess I'm not exactly a WvWer per se. The actual game mode doesn't interest me so much, it's just an open PvP map to me.
---
The reason I don't participate or care about PPT is pretty much what you say, I don't really care about winning the match up. I think the Alliances update will help alleviate that since it will feel like more playing for guild pride and with people you know rather than server pride which hasn't existed for years now.
---
I still probably won't do the whole blob thing because I find the game play of blob fights to be boring, but running around in small scale and actually PPTing? Maybe. 
---
Weaver is complex, warrior doesn't really have good aoes to tag mobs when farming. Ranger is also versatile when it comes to melee and ranged combat and is very mobile. 
---
Racial differences are minimal. Only impact it had is aesthetic and the “personal story” of your character early on, and starting zone. But getting to the other starter zones is super easy. You are a five minute walk from your main city which has a portal to the central city which has portals to every other main city.
---
As far as class goes, that’s entirely up to you. Read up on them and decide on game play. Most are pretty well balanced in PVE. Skills are relatively limited - they roll in additional skills as you level up but once you get to I think level 20 or so (out of 80) you have them all. 
---
The skills change based around the weapon you equip. So a thief has one set of skills when equipping a dagger and a different with a pistol, etc.
---
When you reach 80 and have the chance to choose a specialization, you gain access to an additional weapon. But you can (if you earn enough hero points) but both specialization and switch between them at will. 
---
&gt; On that note, the prints around the Hunting Lodge are more likely to be centaur hoofprints rather than horse. It's a known White Mantle hideout, and the Mantle were largely responsible for the movement of centaurs from Harathi Hinterlands through Caudecus' Manor and down to Shaemoor. The Lodge is right on the path and a logical stopping place given their alliance.
---
Maybe, but the lodge is unknownly used by the white mantle, it's not like it's an "official" hideout where white mantles and centaures come and go. 
---
Also you can see cart traces using the same paths as the hoofprints, but no other footprints. Even if human pull the carts, there had to be human footprints. Deeper human footprints, because the carts are heavy enough to make their own (relatively deep) traces. 
---
However, I also think it would be funny to have a normal animal like a horse as a fantasy creature in a fantasy game, but imo all the hints show that horses are real in tyria. I think this topic can always be discussed untill we actually see real horses ingame or get a confirmation that horses aren't real animals. :)
---
I'd love this purely for the novelty of firing death's judgement into a group. You'd be able to see the team players doing the *"Get down Mr President"* to protect their commander while those that don't give a fuck leap out of the way.
---
I have two light armor classes and three different armors. One is a full set and two are mixed skins and I'm very happy with all of them. 
---
So...
---
To be fair all of these seem to be wishy washy fluff answers that don't commit to anything. 
---
anet nerfing something fun that doesn't affect other players? never!
---
There are non-meta builds that do their job and non-meta builds that don't. Kitless power holo belongs to the first category with a dps ceiling that's &lt;10% below the meta and a rotation that's so easy that you have a good chance of beating an equally competent meta holo in real raids. The conversation posted by the OP does not look like such a build, but rather as if the other guy was running some clown fiesta build with toughness and whatever else.
---
Overheat only does like 5k damage, so it can't be the sole factor of you getting downed.
---
Lemme correct you. Thief is NOT a stealth character. You dont have stealth like in wow or swtor, but rather vanishes for a couple of seconds. Some of the builds utilize absolutely 0 stealth. Thief is more a high mobility or evasive class than stealth class, with skills that have dodge windows and alot of shadowsteps and teleports. Therefore daredevil fits perfectly, making it high mobility and highly evasive. 
---
Per other commenters, circumstances are important here. Generally, when looking for a party in LFG, be honest about what you're looking for in a group or read what a group is looking for before you join. I personally, do not play METAs. More often than not, it's due to how a character players. I like to play my own builds and configurations. With my builds, I do however run arcDPS to monitor my outputs as i like to do better or "one-up" other people. As far as PUGs go, I'm not a fan. Most pug groups are below par in skill level or communication. My recommendation is simple, find a guild that has a focus in the game types and play styles you use. Imho, don't join "big guilds" that focus on "everything." 
---
As far as my opinion goes, is it a dick move? Yes and no. If I want to play content I want to be rewarded. I don't want to play content repeatedly and fail. While the game is fun to play, I'm playing specific content to complete long-term goals. If it was a fractal and a kick on the first wipe, that's not too bad. If it's been a couple wipes I'd be frustrated. If you made it 75% of a raid or got kicked right before the end boss, then yes, it'd be a dick move. 
---
"But I had Aegis!"
---
Fractal tier 3 . Subject 6, 4th wipe. 
---
You already have them :&gt;
---
REEE MY INTERNET POINTS
---
I honestly see them re-using a weapon a class already has acces to (either core or via elite spec) before them adding new weapons. Even though it'd be a cool thing, we already have such a wide variety of weapons that it'd be nice to have but definitely not needed.
---
If I could hijack this post a bit - what is the easiest way to get ascended gear as f2p. Crafting is hellishly expensive, I hear. Are raids/fractals better options?
---
Except you can see him sleeping hanging off the ceiling of a cave.
---
With all due respect they were very clear with "we haven't started on it yet. It could take six months, or longer" and all of that was only a year ago. Alliance system is a bad example imo.
---
My theory/headcanon is that dragons change size based on how much magic they have. We've kinda seen this in the story with &gt;!Aurene!&lt;. That could also explain why Zhaitan seems a bit smaller compared to the other Elder Dragons after being starved and Primordus' growth spurt after a few hundred years of eating the remains of Asuran civilization underground.
---
You would have hated the old WvW then. Each server had PvE bonuses based on their WvW score/standing.
---
What I was getting at is that they can easily say if you're a [New Elite Spec for Warrior], you will harness the Greatsword in a new way.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
They could give us a Longbow for a [New Elite Spec for a Guardian]. I feel as long as they make things fresh and different that I don't care too much about the actual weapon choice.
---
Funny you mention this. The human female running animation has been changed to give a better emphasis on their buttocks and chest bouncing in comparison to the original one.
---
You can main Deadeye in PvE and choose something else for sPvP.  
---
I main thief in PvE, currently as DE because the novelty hasn't worn off. I swap to Daredevil when in PvP or when I want that Dervish nostalgia hit.
---
I've played around a lot with the hook and, personally, I cannot at all recommend turning off the fog. The game was designed with the fog in mind and thus often looks kinda unfinished and rough without it. Probably just personal taste though.
---
Not salt, just reality. 
---
I would recommend GS and axe/shield. Best support firebrand can offer in fractals is dmg, cc, quickness and aegis.
---
Thanks for all your help!
---
Sometimes those assets are for story instances. Not the case with this, but there are similar ships in Cursed Shore as well, used for the lighthouses mission.
---
HoT maps like Verdant Brink or Auric Basin have really extreme height differences. For example, have you ever seen [the top of the golden city](https://imgur.com/gallery/e3wVR88)? It's so high that you normally can't even see it from the ground.
---
Use [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNAR7dnkICVBhddCGCBkdil4BzqEkviUVBgGQ9Se/1/WgA-jhRBABUq+zV7PK/A4JAgnuBzUCa8FBgUARMZD-e) build for Raids, replace Righteous Instincts with Perfect Inscriptions on Fractals if you have full Fractal masteries, 150+ AR and Large Offensive Potion.
---
I (thief, first class and still main) ran around with my bf (engi, second class and now main) through most of PvE &amp; Core Story with no problems. We stuck with them through our first steps into Heart of Thorns maps, died died died, got better &amp; smarter, and went into Path of Fire with our new specs.
---
Don't worry about meta builds (a solution), but instead try to understand how skills, gear, traits, etc. synergize (understanding the problem), and game mechanics (like dodging/evading, huge part of being a thief). You won't need much through Core maps, but Heart of Thorns is a step up. 
---
I like mace/shield-hammer for cc or mace/shield- axe/shield for fury! 
---
No, he's never going to feel as fulfilling so long as four decisions decide his entire build.  He feels like playing with duplo blocks while every other class gets legos.
---
\&gt; I call Poz my greatest supporter because he is always there to help with IT issues and listens to me me vent about my problems for hours on end.   
---
So basically a massive friendzoned cuck, considering she has a boyfriend who doesn't have to deal with that shit.
---
Meh, they were bonuses so I didn't care much. It was nice to have them and I totally forgot they existed for the rest of the time. 
---
An active, visible punishment would just serve to annoy people more than anything else imo.
---
Like all of Anet's answers, otherwise you get a lot of hype and talk but even more disappointment in the end cause they can't make it happen
---
Personally, I'd much rather give constructive criticism about what a player could do better vs just kicking them. I don't often run fractals [thus I'm not giving any feedback in these posts]. I play mainly open world mentoring or dungeons. But depending on the content being played, one can't always focus on another's play enough to give them good feedback. 
---
Per a group setting in this setting and while running arcDPS, I'd be more likely to leave and create a new group than kicking other people. 
---
100% agree it bother every time i use use all option :/
---
This is a gross oversimplification but to make it easier to pick, just ask yourself if you want to play ranged or melee. If you want to play ranged Deadeye will have more toys for you to play with in that niche and go with Daredevil if you want to play melee for the same reason.
---
You can, of course, play a melee Deadeye or a ranged Daredevil but speaking in very broad strokes that's the difference between the two.
---
Thanks!
---
At my level of max MF (800-900%), it's likely to get a precursor from the yellow UI. In practice, I got about a stack of ecto from a stack of yellow UI, one rare every six green UI and about 5 charms/symbols for a stack of green/blue. The MF is obsolete to me and dumped to Droobert for 3.5g / stack of exotic luck. The rest is mats used for provisioner tokens and legendary crafting. So in total it's a win-win.
---
You don't need full zerkers if you are running that build. Swap in Valk for some of the zerker gear. 
---
You need 30% crit base. Fury gives 20% and retal  gives 50%. You can go lower with static raid comps if you have spotter, but 30% is the lowest for general play. 
---
Show that they actually care about the balance in WvW.
---
Zergs are many multiples of 3 or 4 classes because there's very little role for classes such as thief or engi despite some people making them work. Meta is stale, good players have left.
---
Small scale balance is complete trash especially compared to PvP. Here's a few examples as I usually run small scale.
---
Condi mirage in PvP is merely unfun to fight and I wouldn't even call it broken (besides the whole mirage cloak mechanic, but I think thats a different story). But if built right, WvW condi mirage is pretty much an unkillable tank that also spits out a multitude of condis and can also disengage in the blink of an eye with no punishment. Not only unfun but disgustingly broken in WvW.
---
I have been hit on my rev for 9k long range shots from sic em soulbeasts shooting me from 1800 range away. Damage mods out of control, and the build takes absolutely no skill to pull off.
---
Holosmiths can get away with running shield and every tanky trait, yet still manage to do good damage. Ain't fun to face.
---
And finally, herald, my main, does way too much burst damage in WvW. I shouldn't be nearly shotting someone with a simple burst combo.
---
So essentially Anet have proven they dont care about small scale balance. This has driven away all the good roamers and its doubtful we will ever get them back.
---
You actually need only 20% as Radiant Power gives 10% crit chance, even less if you consider Banners, Fractal Potion and Spotter. In fact, a full Valkyrie build should be able to reach 100% crit chance on Fractals.
---
But if you go for the minimal crit chance you will be limited only to Righteous Instincts. Slotting Perfect Inscriptions over Righteous Instincts, if you already have 100% crit chance, can be a substantial dps increase for the group and it will allow you to use Bane Signet liberally for more CC.
---
Also, by slotting Valkyrie you get less power from Potent Superior Sharpening Stone due to less precision to power. So even in identical scenarios, full Zerk pulls ahead any Valkyrie build, if only marginally. 
---
Sort of, there's a bit of a timing to it. You need to let the turret apply the water field to you, and that then combos with the blast when you detonate your turret for the extra healing. This all have very fast but it's not quite instantaneous. 
---
Also I'm pretty sure that an alacrity renegade isn't really meta at all for raids currently, still two chronos largely. Fractals? Most people wouldn't use condition renegade there to begin with. 
---
Can someone explain what the bug is?
---
Oh, right. In think two or three mentions since 2016 or something. Stupid me.
---
I've done thousands of Fractals.  T3 is the threshold where you need to really solidify your gameplay.  
---
**The truth is that clearing Fractals is a really low bar.  It's about the equivalent of getting a 70% on a test or the, ["D" is for Diploma] memes.**  It's not something to be proud of...  Sure, you can clear Fractals, but what sets you apart from a T1/T2 player? Gear? AR? --*the bare minimum? -- really, you (player in OP's PMs) want to be proud of that?*
---
The truth is that it *should* be gameplay, professions specific tips, skips and tricks and DPS.  If you queue into a group as a DPS player and they need ***DPS,*** then you're not going to get carried doing 5-10k in T3.  It really does need to be along the lines of 10-15k+ ideally being in the 20-30k+ range if you consider yourself a competent Fractal Frequenter at the T3/T4 level. 
---
Another underlying point is that large mistlock potions are a *significant* DPS boost.  You're looking at, what, at an extra ~ 15% power and condition damage from the [Large Fractal Offensive potion?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Large_Mist_Offensive_Potion) So yeah, if you aren't playing to the T3/T4 level then when competent performance is needed of you (Thaumanova, Underground, Siren's Reef, Twilight Oasis, Nightmare, S.Obs) then there's a decent chance you'll get replaced if your team is truly struggling due to your lack of *proper,* **valuable** participation.  
---
Actually, recent update put DE behind DD. Thief was still getting the 5% damage buff for using daggers, Anet fixed the trait and now DD sightly out damages DE.
---
Lmao. Totally!
---
That's why I put “within reason“ in parentheses. Some people are incentivized by positive reinforcement, some by negative.
---
A punishment shouldn't be some massive active detriment to the server but something should happen when you lose. More than just “aw man we lost that server-wide bonus“. Fear of missing out ranks lower than fear of being punished.
---
Why not both? They use exactly the same gear, and almost exactly the same traits. You can easily swap back and forth for whatever you are doing.
---
This is Blizzard-level "we hear you" vomited in response to an incensed issue that they won't or can't fix.  It's a political statement that ambiguously acknowledges the concern has been heard to hopefully make players shut up about it by *insinuating* things are happening behind the curtain while neither promising anything nor admitting nothing is happening; either response would end terribly so they stave the issue for another day, another year, hoping people give up.  
---
It's the nice way of saying "we heard you the first thousand times and we're still not working on it."  I appreciate that people keep pressing them on this but I'm convinced by now they have no plans to ever implement them.
---
They are friends that have a platonic relationship.  Not sure why people think there needs to be something else. Friends can just be friends.
---
Like u/Gunnho said, they usually hide large models under the map so that they're loaded in advance and can immediately appear when their respective events start. They do the same with most giant World Bosses like Shadow Behemoth, Claw of Jormag, Tequatl etc.
---
I guess  I'll main deadeye and switch between the two! I just hope deadeye will be fine in end game PvP and PvE. Thanks for all the input guys. I appreciate it all!
---
most power builds use berserker (or sometimes assassins) stats with scholar runes. if a new player buys orr armour and slots in scholar runes, they essentially lost \~42 gold if they ever intend to switch to ascended. in comparison, a full exotic light berserker set costs about 5-8 gold (depending on instabuy or ordering) and runes can be salvaged by black lion kits, which are readily available for anyone who logs in somewhat frequently and doesn't waste them.
---
the cost of a full exotic set from the TP can be recuperated within 3-4 days of about 10 minutes gameplay just by doing the dailies. a full karma set costs 252k karma, and apart from orphan runs, you'll never get that much within 30 minutes gameplay.
---
as for your argument that casual or new players will have easily 252k karma but not even 10 gold lying around, sorry, but that just doesn't make sense from any perspective. the only way to get this much karma nowadays is by heavily farming LS4 maps with karmic retribution (which, btw isn't cheap to buy in the first place) or orphans during wintersday. if a player is that dedicated to farming karma, they simply CANNOT be in a position where 10 gold is a huge deal, as all non-wintersday karma farms also reward a good deal of gold or tradable valuables like mats etc.
---
While I think this reasoning is fair, that's not what you told him (based on your post).
---
If you had asked him why he kept dying or why he didn't deal damage, or why he ignored mechanics  that might have helped.
---
I don't know what happened before the kick, but I'd suggest quickly asking someone directly in group chat to do something (more damage/ mechanics/ whatever) if you notice that they don't perform to your standards.
---
Your comment sounds like you don't actually care about their build, but that everyone pulls their weight, in your whispers, on the other hand, you tell him to play a meta build, and that's it.
---
I'd suggest you try to improve the wording the next time, and they might even listen to you.
---
What do you mean by "merge it into P1"?
---
For those sweet, sweet Honor of the Waves heavy armor skins.
---
The game does try to pool people by language, you're right there. It's not unusual to see a mixture of languages in game, though. 
---
You get a free server transfer when you go from free-to-play to paid, according to the wiki.

It's not going to get much lower than ~ $37-40.

I want to see the expression on his face when he logs on after years of being away and has to clear out a backlog of six hundred messages one mail at a time.

That's you though. You're not everyone.

Just quoting [Tybalt Leftpaw](/u/AutoModerator) here:

You can recraft Aurora ?

Damage Control 101. I wonder what makes you spam that kind of BS PR explanation... You're pathetic. Bria is a scamming whore and Poz is a cuck, that's the only truth.
---
Yes, dlgamer (unless they hate your country for no reason) is a good choice and official trustable place. Better sale than them only really happens if anet puts up a big sale like last few times.
---
I always go Sword 3, Laser Disk, Photon Wall, EXUCALIBAH, detonate Photon Wall
---
Why? It is a direct dps increase over Righteous Instincts in Fractals.
---
Checked wiki. Contact support. Say you picked the wrong language. They've changed it in the past for people. 
---
Never had that problem, especially with heat therapy.
---
I would so much like to see choke points actually mean something.  Pile up enemy bodies that have to be climbed over or removed.  Deny access points with siege that has to be destroyed before the path is cleared.  ... would be an interesting weekend 'tryme'.
---
Just to add to your comment, this game doesn’t punish or locks your decisions. You don’t have to main deadeye and feel locked there, you can constantly switch between core, dd, de. 
---
I think, like with gem purchases, there is a delivery time of up to 72 hours. I waited around 8 hours for my account to be upgraded, so don't worry yet, these things, unfortunatly, take a bit of time :3
---
200LI yes the veteran category! nobody fakes them, you can't possibly get those from spamming escort, trio and whatnot weekly either..also a known fact that once you reach triple digits your performance just skyrockets and at 200 you already pulling 93% of benchmarks..it's just science really
---
i said it's the worst dps spec which is a fact, the rambling about triggers and friends not letting me play reaper are your imagination
---
so you can't see how a boss could get moved out of your nightfall+well? oh right, you don't know that to reach that amazing 29k you need to do locust swarm, nightfall, well of suffering and instantly enter shroud to scale them up with that 600 ferocity and increased crit chance? if you spam everything on cooldown you are looking at something in the 24k area..but that's fine cuz there is no big difference between 24k and 29k just like there is no biggie between 29k and 33k or 33k and 37k..
---
viable? depends on how far you wanna stretch the concept i suppose..dagger focus fresh air core ele is viable too given how forgiving enrage timers are but i assume you are aware the slower it goes the higher chance of failure 
---
Do elite spec collections 
---
I always thought of the Heart of Thorns (the big rotating tree) as the closest thing we had to Mordremoth's physical body. Zhaitan had a [Mouth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mouth_of_Zhaitan) too, which definitely wasn't his dragon form so I assume this is also the case with the Mouth of Mordremoth.
---
thanks for being this invested into this (I would never have guessed to find this kind of info in the wiki) but given my account is ~5 years old i don't really think that's going to work.
---
But mails aren't infinite...
---
Unread message also auto-delete after a certain period of time. But it's fun to imagine.
---
Each weapon has a purpose.
---
Axe-&gt; AoE fury, but is a bit weak on the harrier variant. It also has a cleaner pull than GS but doesn't have the 360 range.
---
Sword-&gt; AoE fury, a lot more damage and a single blind.
---
Scepter-&gt;AoE might (not too much) and a ranged weapon option and single target immobilize.
---
Mace-&gt; AoE Regen, Heals on auto and Aegis,
---
Shield-&gt; I think this is the best weapon CC guardian has to offer (with shield 5), it also heals and #4 gives your allies protection and aegis.
---
Focus-&gt; If you don't need for much CC and want to pump out some damage.
---
Greatsword-&gt; AoE Retal, Pull and decent damage.
---
Hammer-&gt; AoE protection, CC and zone control when you're being rushed by a lot of trash mobs.
---
\----
---
If you're purely playing as a defensive support kind of class, then go Mace-Shield and Greatsword (or Hammer)
---
  
---
If you're playing a bit more offensively sword-shield and greatsword (or Scepter-focus) isn't a bad combo either.
---
Now if there was a Power, Toughness, Ferocity stat set that would be another matter entirely.
---
Probably means raids?
---
Somehow I was afraid of being suggested PvP.  
---
I personally suck at it, my reflexes are not anymore what they used to be (hit the 40s wall two years ago), so I'm not sure...  
---
Do these tomes drop regardless of performance, or would I end up uselessly attempting to earn them?
---
I meant level 80s, sorry should’ve clarified. Can you link me to those spots please? :)
---
You might recall Trehearne when he said that cutting off every tree and pulling out every root wont help because he has spreaded out too much already. This probably means that the whole jungle is his body and this massive tree is most likely his physical heart or store for magic energy which explains why the mouth as his dragon body as defender was there.
---
Also the mouth shares the same voice with the spirit of mordremoth which should be convincing enough
---
Crafting is easiest.
---
Not true. Why would you not want the increased passvie power from perfect inscriptions? You get enough crit chance in fractals without righteous instincts anyway
---
They're expansion-only, not free-to-play. 
---
I remember once having a conversation with someone in map chat on an alternate account, only to have someone else point out that our names were "Bella Rubbins" and "Tummy Tickles." I hadn't even noticed until they said it. Now I haven't forgotten it, and it's been at least a couple of years.
---
I should see if they're still around. 
---
I've been mailing this person's who's toon is "I lost my sock" every so often for about a year now with ugly socks. Each time they reply thankful and with something along the lines of losing the previous socks I've sent. 
---
There are lots of "features" in dungeons where you can complete multiple paths at once.
---
&gt; (I'm f2p so I can't do any dungeons.)
---
That's not true.
---
It's probably worth stating that you may need to swap Sword of Justice for "Stand Your Ground!" in raids, as chronos no longer provide enough retaliation to make it permanent. I think one dragonhunter taking it per squad should be sufficient, and you can drop it entirely if your subgroup contains 3 DHs?
---
In fractals I also like to run "Feel My Wrath!" instead of Dragon's Maw if running with a boon chrono, as they cannot maintain permanent quickness by themselves and Dragon's Maw is a bit rubbish.
---
I thought it was a keeper! 
---
I never understood why people want to solo in an MMO...
---
But to answer your question, power reaper :)
---
You must have a sad life
---
Thank you very much!
---
Yeah, but if you're doing fractals and your healer isn't on point or you don't have protection AND you have frailty... and god forbid... birds... you're dropping without a doubt.
---
I wish I could say tempest...
---
It isn't and is actually pretty fun. I just prefer Deadeye because it fits my character's aesthetics and roleplay aspects and because I played Daredevil all throughout HoT. 
---
Try guardian

For those who are interested, here is also [Jessica Rabbit](https://i.imgur.com/cC2gyK9.png) and [Aladdin &amp; Jasmine](https://i.imgur.com/X87YA2L.png) :)

I can't tell if it's an experienced player, a noob or Kiel.   
---
Nice tho, you managed to capture the feeling of 'my team is a pile of garbare divided into smaller pilles that don't want to stack together XD
---
Quick fixes while you learn weaving. Get some high vitality trinkets and accessories to wear in open world and solo. The health makes a big difference. 
---
Second, use the glyph of elementals and the elite elemental skill. This gives you two pets that you can rotate to tank for you.

I do play WvW, but to become more active I'd need a more vibrant biome of different players. Noobs and PvE'ers, casuals and more involved players, veterans and people who step up and commandeer.
---
That not only allows involved players to move down to a more relaxing, casual playstyle and PvE'ers and noobs to become more experienced and turn into veterans, it also leads to a broader appeal. Gankers have more to prey on than each other, Commanders have more people carrying supplies or calling in attacks or uprading towers or defending camps or dolyaks. Noobs can step on the battlefield without immediately being jumped upon by a dozen starving wolves.
---
Right now it's a toxic cesspool that cannibalizes itself in its fervent exclusivity. Unless Anet blows it all up and goes through with drastic changes against the screeching fanatics, there is little to be done against the self-perpetuating downward spiral.
---
the animators are doing their bestest
---
30 gold is without dungeon recipes. Takes around 2 hours 20 minutes for all the paths I listed.
---
Spears would actually work well considering where we are in the story. Bitter and enraged the commander takes one of the dragon blood spear and goes on a journey to forge a stronger one. 
---
I did get the New update  available message.  I was disappointed that there was no way within the app to have it download and update itself.  Not even a link to your gitHub.  I see that you've added the link in 0.9.  yay!
---
Comments for version 0.9:
---
I love the Skins tab.  Very cool.  Would be nice to be able to see the ones I don't have (like you have for the Minis.
---
I like the Minis tab showing the ones you don't have.  I would prefer seeing the actual icon for the minis that you do have.
---
Nothing shows in the Titles tab.
---
I currently am using GW2Hook along with ArcDps.  I'm beyond hesitant to try your update Arc or Arc Mechanics button.  Any comment on that?
---
I saw your post on the official forums about weekly shard cap in the api

---
Keep up the good work!
---
What about the rifle turret? The guide I'm following is using it. Do I just place it and leave it there?
---
&gt; 1 more advice i would like to give you is that dont be shy in game. Just ask in map chat whenever you dont understand anything about anything.
---
Yeah, that's the main reason why I purchased the expansion, so I could freely use the chat.  
---
Luckily I'm not shy of asking, not even when a question might seem dumb to some people (there's never a dumb question, only dumb answers!)  
---
As per the toxicity, it's ok, I've grown on the Internet, so I'm used to it.
---
Just a note about the PvE scenarios, but with the recent fix to the previously bugged Dagger Training, Daredevil is now better for both single target and cleave damage while offering many other extra benefits. 
---
You're welcome. I half-remembered seeing it. 
---
You lose nothing by asking them. Worst case scenario is that it costs you 500 gems to go to a lower population one with English as the primary language. 
---
The wiki is practically part of the game, so it's worth checking for little details like that. 
---
JustCallMeAndrew basically explained it well. It's been four days for me, some other people reported it's been going on for well over a week and nobody in our instance can finish the story. 
---
"To be continued..."
---
Hey if you're going to play pvp don't worry about the staff. A PvP daredevil always uses dagger &amp; pistol.
---
If you like stealthy characters it's also very good, stealthing yourself or your team at the start of the match is DD 101 (pistol 5+dagger 2 or pistol 5+shortbow 2).
---
Here are some VODs of demonstrating it from some of my friends, you can do it on many characters, I'll get one of my friends to record another updated version and I'll edit this post sometime this week.

---
I personally go with daredevil in PvE because you tag the mob instead of single targets. Deadeye for wvw / PvE because I also enjoy the concept of that specialization. 
---
Why not? It can work both mechanically and thematically.
---
Firstly, Nercomancer needs a new Melee weapon, and Greatsword is locked behind Reaper. In particular, Necromancer needs a melee Condi weapon. The latter is important for balancing Necromancer in the future because Scepter is OP from a design standpoint (strips boons, ranged, no projectiles), which forces devs to make Scepter a numerically weaker weapon. However, the addition of a new condi weapon will allow devs to safely allow Necromancer the condi capabilities it always wanted. If Spear is added baseline, all the more better. 
---
As for the theme, it could focus on Poison and could be based the infamous [poop spears](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/vdx4ad/brown-death-a-history-of-poop-as-a-weapon-111), where early warriors would lace the spearhead with poison and poop as an early bio-chemical weapon.  Now, I'm not literally suggesting GW2 to use poop as a weapon, but the idea of putrid spearhead was one of the most terrifying weapons of pestilence throughout history, spreading diseases and plague to their enemies. There couldn't be a better way for Necros to use a spear.
---
Anyway, I've gotcha with both mechanical and thematic justifications.
---
You dont usually think about stealthy moves as daredevil, just saying, so it does make sense
---
Thank you!
---
Yes, I meant raids haha
---
There is a balance to be had. To be honest, just some ingame text dialogue by Rytlock would already have been enough. 
---
C: "You heard anything about... Zojja?"
---
R: "I check on her every once in a while. But the time in the Blighting Pod really... ate away at her. She's still in treatment, sometimes it's like she doesn't notice anything at all. Just stares holes in the air, mumbling."
---
C: "That is jarring news. She's a good friend... and she'd have been a powerful ally in this battle to come."
---
R: "It's more than that, Commander. Kralkatorrik... he killed our friend, Snaff. You've met him when Glint sent him and Eir from the Mists. He meant... everything to her. Now she won't be here to-"
---
C: "Avenge him. I understand. Let us avenge him in her stead, then. And let's do it well." 
---
R: "Aye, Commander. Let's do it well."
---
I cant really get any laurels cause f2p accounts dont have log in rewards.

It's not perfect because you don't have access to every rune/sigil but you can go to the PvP training area. In PVP you have the elite specs fully unlocked and all damage is standardized so even if you have common gear you'll do proper damage. 
---
There are training dummies to test your damage and AoE on and then there are AI versions of players as well as the PvE enemies in PvP maps to attack.
---
Go to the PvP lobby. You unlock everything automatically and can use whatever trait/gear combo you want (within reason, not all PvE stat weights are available). 
---
But you can definitely *test* via this method.

---
still need an update from deltaconnected, but basically it work anyway 
---
So unless you're running shield offhand and inventions trait line (which will severely impact your DPS), holo is very squishy compared to some other classes. It's really about being smart with your rolls and being able to dodge mechanics.
---
Has anyone tested this with the Radial Mounts menu? I also use GW2Hook, but assume compatibility with that would be a long shot. 
---
I recommend never using the overheat trait unless you're in a group with good heals - it is very much only intended for max dps in raids and such. Just taking the vent exhaust trait instead will improve your survivability SO MUCH when you're not being constantly healed. It also allows you to enter forge more often for clearing trash mobs and such. 
---
How do you get to 900?? The wiki guide has 450 as max you can get from boosts, but it's hard to have them all. That's 750 max?
---
Depends if you're on EU ot not
---

---
Thank you so much for the information! I had no idea you could do this!
---
Thanks for the info! :)
---
500 skill points = 50 Hps in PoF or HoT isnt a huge time investment. You only need like 2-4h once for every char. And then you unlocked everything.
---
What are Hps? I haven't done, well... basically anything in story/expansion content past vanilla GW2

---
Sounds like you want to play a Revenant. In particular, you may love a Condi Renegade.
---
- Can support allies with Alacrity. (Sometimes replacing a Chonomancer in certain comps)
---
- Can grant allies the most powerful life steal in the game with Soulcleave Summit
---
- Can cleanse condis and grant allies resistance with Mallyx, which is useful when being condi bombed by certain bosses
---
- Very, very good CC.
---
- Perma Slow on enemies if using Mace/Axe + Shortbow rotation, which will make you very useful for fractals.
---
- (If using Devastation) Assassin's Presence grants allies +150 Ferocity
---
Even the Revenant's Power Spec, Herald, still finds use as an offensive-support class. Its ability to provide 10man Fury and Protection, as well as 10man Life Steal, makes Herald a respectable support in comps which need it.
---
In general, Revenant has a number of support roles in raids, such as being the best Kiter for fights like Deimos and Cairn. This is in part because Revenant has 2 blocks on a short-ish cd (Staff and Shield OH0, while also having Glint as a 3s pseudo-invuln.
---
in last  2 months in t4 fractals theres MILION of new ppl,which have no idea what to do,i stoped doing recs all together and im going t4 ONLY with cm party. 
---
Yea, the use will definitely vary per group but I find that with the disruptions that can happen retal can easily drop (and if you don't have retal when SoI is cast you get nothing from it). I thought it worth mentioning just in case :)
---
Is this a rethorical question or do actually need someone to say no?
---
I also kind of like how Caladbolg strengthens the users prominent trait  mordremoth taking the opposite approach
---
No, you're not. Why would you think that? Pretty sure most people like the visuals of the elder dragons.
---
We got [this explanation](https://youtu.be/B6J55-Nh790?t=33m28s) from Link Hughes regarding Primordus looking different in GW2:
---
&gt; **Link Hughes:** There was also some back and forth because there's, at the end of Guild Wars 1, the depiction of the Great Destroyer and then this dragon eye opening when you defeat the Great Destroyer. So there's some question about is that Primordus, is that a Primordus lieutenant, what was going on there? I don't think it's ever clarified in Guild Wars 1, and we had concept art that seemed to indicate that maybe that was much smaller than, like, real Primordus's actual look. There was a lot of back and forth about this, but ultimately the concept art that is the loading image for that instance was put together, and then our prop artists Sam and Chris did an amazing job [...] just to make that live.  
---
So, basically there was uncertainty among the devs making Flashpoint whether the dragon statue which oversaw the Great Destroyer and opened its eyes at the end of "Ogden's Benediction" was Primordus or another one of his lieutenants. They couldn't find any references to it being Primordus in neither wikis and apparently not even in their internal lore bible or fellow devs (despite there being references to Primordus; the problem at the time was that neither GWwiki nor GW2wiki listed sources so it'd require some digging to find the information for any dev looking for info) so they decided to go with the new look instead.
---
Assuming they don't just retcon the dragon opening its eyes at the end of "Ogden's Benediction" being just another dragon champion, a way to salvage this change is to explain Primordus's radically chaged look with him nomming on so much magic that it has altered his appearance. We've already seen with Aurene, Caudecus and Matthias Gabrel that eating/being exposed to magic can cause physical growth and other changes in dragons, and such would logically also be the case with Elder Dragons. We should also consider [this insightful comment](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/496259/#Comment_496259) from Matthew Medina about Mordremoth's appearance, powers and potential origins which support the aforementioned theory of magic causing mutations in beings:
---
&gt; Mordremoth may, at one time, have had a traditional corporeal body as a "dragon". Honestly, it's the only one who probably remembers and at this point it really isn't important. At some point in history as it fed and grew however, it "became" the jungle. It grew into the ground, spread vines and roots as offshoots of its physical self, while at the same time, its mind grew to encompass this huge mass. As such, Mordremoth isn't one single entity, unless you are describing the entire jungle.  
---
&gt; The "Mouth of Mordremoth" is Mordremoth in the same way that the vines and roots of the jungle which tear the Pact fleet down is Mordremoth. And the Avatar of Mordremoth you fight in "Hearts and Minds" is also Mordremoth. All of its physical manifestations can be hurt/killed but until you destroy its mind entirely, it never really "dies". As you noted, there was enough concurrent attacks on Mordremoth's physical aspects at the end of Heart of Thorns, and while parts of its mind are distracted to fight off those attacks, the Commander's team enters its central mind and defeats it there. But even then there's still a kernel of its consciousness in a certain valuable "host", so that when you finally destroy the last vestige of that in Trahearne, Mordremoth finally does meet its end. This leaves the body (the jungle, vines, certain mordrem etc.) behind still somewhat functional, but effectively handicapped without that central overmind to direct it.  
---
Another possible explanation for Primordus's change could be what I'd call the "Lavos approach": basically the GW2 Primordus would be the titan "shell" which shields the smaller, GW1 Primordus within it as the core. Fighting the Titan Primordus could be part of a big meta event, or at least a large scale story instance, culminating in the heroes piercing through the titan shell and entering the core to battle Primordus's draconic core (like with Lavos in Chrono Trigger) as his GW1 model would be of a decent enough size to still be intimidating but allow a more intimate battle against an Elder Dragon akin to the Avatar of Mordremoth. :)

Zhaitan is a bit 😱 but what’s scary is how everything flickers so much. You’ll swim along and stuff will just randomly appear and disappear, there’s insta-kill walls, some weird lightning storm.....BAM the giants who threw boulders are you are suddenly in your face
---
Idk, breaking under maps normally mildly scares me but I do it anyway for exploring, but I’m never going under arah story again. Fuck that
---
Does jasmine has a camel toe? o.O
---
A lot of stuff is locked at level 26. IIRC, you only have the first spec available. Not even the elite skill is unlocked. The community generally suggests leveling up to 80 on the first play through to get a better idea of all the weapons available to the class, all the skills and many in-game mechanics.
---
Another advise that's often given to people is to boost a character, play the first instance of PoF story to get the raptor and then play another character. Leveling in gw2 is not very time consuming tbh. 
---
If you just want to get a feel for the class, the boost allows you to try the class at lvl 80 in silverwastes. Silverwastes is one of the most popular gold farms in the game that has been around for a few years. It's not the best, but you generally find squads there because it's available to ftp players and it's pretty chill. You don't get to try out elite specs, which do sometimes change a class significantly, but it's worth a try.

I loved WvW in every other game I've played, but I find it annoying in GW2.
---
1) Most commanders on NSP are barely literate oafs who cannot communicate or command.
---
2) The chat channels on NSP are a nightmare.  It's all spam that makes barrens chat look like bliss - and it's not even people pvping.   They're just there to spam shitty memes, but you never actually see those names in the fights.
---
3) Whenever you get a pirate ship, it's amazing - until you get swarmed by a zerg.
---
4) Whenever you're running with a zerg, it's boring.  You're just running around looking for five guys to swarm and you barely participate in the fights, it's just a swarm fest.
---
5)  Whenever your zerg runs into another zerg, NSP instantly quits.   Anything resembling a real fight and NSP immediately wipes, half the people leave the raid and the commander is immediately demanding to switch to another zone and take undefended keeps.
---
6) In the time it takes to run from NSP garrison to whatever undefended tower the commander thinks we can take, I could queue up for and win at least 2 SPvP matches.
---
7)  SPvP matches I can queue with my guildies and friends who are not on the same server with me and run as a group, instead of being forced to run solo in WvW and beg to join a tag run by a useless halfwit who thinks the epitome of skill is ninja capping Durios Gulch with portals.
---
Basically, it comes down to this - I'd love to play WvW except I hate WvWers.   I'm much happier with my less toxic SPvP brothers.
---
The tank is the pretty poofy pink mage class.
---
In fact, that pretty poofy pink mage class is everything in the game.
---
Hope I helped.
---
They're working to remove those bots afaik. There's RnG in the element of matchmaking because the PvP community is small. Plat2/3 players usually have Gold 3 players in their team, or even high legendary players. The community size doesn't support the matchmaking system. 
---
As far as bots go, just report them and hope the next game you're against them, or, they're just not in the game. I know your frustrations.
---
Sure -- but most of them time i can tell they are moving in some sort of algorithmic pattern and have just glitched into a corner. but also if you're setting your toon to just run into the corner that is really not cool.

Hello,  I have this problem where the sound of the voices of Taimi and my character are really really low. I don't know why it does it. But it's like the focus of the sound is far behind my camera.... I don't hear event NPC talk unless I place my camera so they are behind me. Any idea of what's happening and how to fix it ? Thanks

Did we ever find out who "E" was? Did I just miss it? Or is it still a mystery?

any vids?

I tried revenant for a while and unlocked herald but the energy mechanic was the main thing I didn't like about the class
---
Warrior! Chop, chop, chop.
---
The only things that make them drastically different is the Deadeye has drastic longer range and Daredevil has much more AoE.
---
Really, where? 
---
Depends on do you identify as the victim or the troll :D . I intented the girl to be main character because I chuckle little every time someone triggers mine or falls of the cliff
---
Dude, I'm not going to link every single freaking post, alright? If you think I'm wrong, then so be it. 
---
I think WvW should have had a major restructure long ago. I think it should have directly played into PvE prior to the mega server update. Have winning increase magic find or give access to a raid (like in GW1) or something. But have the supply be actual supply like cloth leather wood and metal for walls and siege. Bones, blood, dust, etc. For more useful and important buffs like cloaking waters or dragon banners. 
---
Maybe not that last part but having it effect PvE would draw in PvE players and have then be interested on the well being of the server. Something Akin to old Alterec Valley in WoW where you did tasks or gave supply to unlock beneficial things to help you against the enemy.
---
I would really like to see a meta power Herald what is accepted in raids and T4. I remember when I started raiding (from the very first day they were released), I played power Herald and got my very first raid boss kills with it.
---
I don't like condi Renegade. Power Herald hits mobs very, very hard in open world, in T1 and in dungeons. I wonder why it is not accepted in raids or T4.
---
Figured most of it was concentrated in one or more posts. I haven't seen anyone complain at all. Wasn't asking you to link every single post.  
---
Stop being so dense. Back up your claim.
---
I feel like somewhere I read this backwards. My responses were written as if you were the one kicked from a group. Regardless, my posts still function towards anyone kicked from a group in any content. Please don't see my posts as an attack. It was just my opinion. Myself and guild members all play by the ideal "you paid for it, play it the way you wish" philosophy. With that said, you still have to perform a function or a role. I also wouldn't backlash with some form of "you can't tell me what to do" response. Just wanted to clarify my stance and what I was understanding. 
---
Are you ever going to Fix the three Tempest Bugs? 
---
1: Your Phoenix activates the Aura from Imbued Melodies when returning to you if you are below the threshold. 
---
2: Gale Song activates even if you have Stability

3: You can start an overload while in mist form (if gets canceled though when mist form is done)

With one weapon slot!

They've hit Buddy! https://youtu.be/JMK6lzmSk2o?t=96

In this case your only choices are guild commendations, fractals and crafting.  
---
or perhaps you could fork the investment and purchase Hearth of Thorns or Path of Fire :) ?  
---
Don't join then. Those kind of guilds are for competitive like minded people who wanna be the best. If you're a casual, keep pug blobing then. Simple as that.

Thanks, I will change it. Seems to be a problem with the mobile version, with firefox and chrome the links work without a problem?

There are rumours that E might stands for StEvE

&gt; ... but no one will ever say dungeons are good gold with PUG strats.
---
I guess i just took it that way because it wasnt said either way. On the weird side of things, i was actually watching that exact video just this past week for research purposes to speed up/look at my own runs in a different light. God tier dungeon runs for sure tho.
---
Wow!
---
So basically they don't have any plans, even though we've asked for this for how many years now?
---
He's a Mister-E. 
---
There's speculation that it's Lord Faron with the L and F written over each other, but it's possibly just a loose end that never got tied up as a story changed in the design process, like the other sylvari tree or what Sun's Refuge is actually supposed to be for. 
---
You can play staff in pvp. Nothing wrong with that.  
---
I've been getting horrible performance since installing the game on a new PC. Based on afterburner's monitoring, it doesn't seem to be using my dGPU at all given that it reports 1% usage there and 20% cpu usage. I tried forcing it in the nvidia control panel and via the desktop shortcut but neither helped. What else could be the issue?

The last activity of E has been during S3E3 Lake Doric. Seem has been involved in **ALL** 3-6 possible choices in the Human Personal stories (Chapters for level 10 and 20.)

It's essentially the difference between do{}while() and while(){}. If I had to do either, I'd default to the latter option unless I had a specific reason to use the former. But who knows, there's probably a good reason it was implemented the way it was. And overall, I'm much happier to have the use all function than not having it, tiny inconvenience or not. :p
---
It is. I also only ear the sound of the wolf's dash when my camera is real close to it. Other peoples sound seems better than my character's so that's weird too

Your "effective level" is just the level of the zone around you that you get downscaled to. So it's not that your level 80 character is as good as a level 16 character, it's that your level 80 character literally has the stats of a level 16 character if you're in a level 16 area.
---
Love my soulbeast. Had to go conditioned for dps but that's ok. Can always swap in support abilities like spirits and pet rez when needed. 
---
That's code for someone hack together a 3rd party add on for us for free
---
Then don't say "a ton"? I don't think I've ever read a post complaining about the dragons being too big, and I read this sub very often. Zhaitan being too small, yeah.
---
faster rewards..not necessarily better, just get those pips and that participation to tick more often
---
remove the damn rank requirements from armor or make them more lenient..i get it's a reward for veterans but guess what, it's very daunting for a new person that gets started on wvw to realize it will take them months of constant play to get what they want
---
less downtime, if you die you walk forever to get back, sometimes you walk forever anyway until you get ganked in a 5v1 or 1shot by some rifle thief that's invisible
---
if i want to fight people i go to spvp because besides waiting a bit to find a game it's fast paced, there is a lot less walking..did i mention balance? say what you want about certain builds being op but nothing reaches the absurdity produced by pve gear in a pvp environment such as wvw

Thank you, and good luck!
---
I have seen guys do this. xD
---
Isn’t it just because the wiki doesn’t take into account the two first steps before the precursor?  I ran across seeing this once but realized that it was ignoring steps 1 &amp; 2 
---
alas so true.
---
This. You're scaled down in lower level zones to give it some challenge, so your character is *effectively* a level 16 while they are in that zone. 
---
This is awesome! I will reinstall just for this. Any chance there will be a Discord?
---
"Bria" and "Poz" are the perfect example of twitch whores stealing money from old, desperate men, without even giving them sex.
---
Yes, you can't hide the truth u/brialeigh and u/thatguypoz
---
We see through the bullshit.
---
The difficulty is knowing which animation you are short cancelling if that is the issue.
---
I do this daily on and off since istan release, you can get all in around 15 minutes when you memorize the locations and become fast and efficient, before that maybe 20-25. I recommend using thief because of stealth which allows you to stay out of combat and mount up faster in some places without having to kill mobs. Also, having a griffon helps a lot because you can reset your position on a race near end of the run on the cliffs.
---
If you're on EU I can take you with me some time, but you'll need a griffon and a thief character(or mesmer with stealth utility and skills), or if anyone else is interested you can send me a mail to Irreversiblee or add to friend list to see when i'm online then whisper, but those requirements still stand. 
---
If you feel your effectiveness is too low for the area you're in then I'm afraid to to say you're just bad at playing said characters.  Rather than blame the scaling I'd focus on explaining what you're doing, what you're struggling with and asking what your options are. 
---
Its the same in WvW, dude. Bad performance doesn't get rewarded. Not only did I try my best and lose, I have to explain to PUGs nicely every game that they lost and it isn't their fault? This post says you haven't been pvping long.
---
Honestly, a pug said in team chat once on a close tie: ignore bell, focus sides. After he said that I cussed him and the team out and afkd just outside spawn. The enemy team ignored me and farmed my team until they got bell.
---
Gotta tell you dude, this fucking hugbox attitude doesn't work.
---
The problem isn't just funerary incense. Replacing crystalline ingots. You also need a ton of elegy mosaics, which are really annoying to farm
---
No fun. Only Alscalonian performers pants.
---
(Jokes. I like dungeons and wish there was more content like it.)
---
exactly this, i don't think OP knows you can swap back and forth whenever you want
---
kinda sucks if i have to rely on luck for a program to work 
---
&gt; why would you ever salvage 
---
when you decide to upgrade from exotic to ascended?
---
You said you were using the position rewinder gizmo.  Take a few attempts to learn the animation timings.  It sounds more like you've become impatient than anything else. 
---
It seems today, that all you see,
---
Is violence, not violets,
---
And sex in RP,
---
But where are those good old fashioned values, on which we used to relyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?
---
Did a fractal run today with this version - all's working pretty well except non-transparent trees in Sliffside, fps dropped to under 60 only in "WTF is happening?!" situations, like today's Twilight Oasis T4 - birbs+convergence+amala is crazy.
---
You get in wvw 5 years ago.As solo player you do rotate all camp all days.
---
You get in wvw now its the same excpet you get intant gib faster.
---
Probably
---
It's not the first time these designs have been posted (both of them) in the same manner. I just wonder who designed it, couldn't find it with reverse search. Didn't spend much time on that though
---
thief: pro farming without any work, stealth allows you to avoid anything you don't wanna fight, big mobility
---
side note, there is really no farming in the traditional sense: you tag stuff during events with other people but going around alone and murdering mobs is very bad profit per time spent
---
There can be only one
---
Could you give us a bit more information about what you mean by "horrible performance"? 
---
It would help people come up with ideas. 
---
Lower FPS in busy areas is a known issue with the game engine. Try putting your charscter in a busy area, turning your graphics settings all the way down and walking them up one at a time.
---
Get a build from Meta battle.com, armor, tunes, sigils, traits etc
---
Nicely done.
---
hello! so i have an exotic geared soulbeast pDPS and i have started doing fractals, so my question is do you just follow the rotation on trash mobs? or what do you usually do then? also the bosses also dont allow for smooth rotation so would i just try to keep it up best i can and just go through the rotation list as fast as possible no matter what? or what happens if i get stunned or something? (this is what i use https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Power_DPS) 
---
Aye, that's the kicker. I'm in the Mabon Market with very few other people around, and seeing FPS frequently dip into the 20s. 
---
&gt; "stuck in the floor while my mount loads"
---
Are you sure that was what fixed it? Apparently that can also be avoided if you use a non-default skin.
---
You didn’t expand your map or open that bouncy chest for three years.
---
You monster.
---
HAHAHA.
---
I used to do a shorten version but then the price of the Sunscythe dropped by too much for me to continue to bother with it.
---
It doesn't even need rewards bleeding into PvE. It needs to be balanced and maintained in an extent that promotes healthy gameplay, which it currently doesn't.
---
Anet did tournaments and said "oh, people appearantly get burned out from them" but they never actually adressed the issues with the gamemode pretending they didn't exist. In fact, judging by their additions later (desert bl, tactivators, ...) they are genuinely clueless. 
---
That's why alliances won't make a difference. They don't actually know how to improve WvW. 
---
Its a vocal minority that doesn’t like it. 
---
&gt;Undefeatable
---

Some of my keybinds in there as well
---
Awesome thank you guys I’ll have to check them out. 
---
Darn I’ve been trying to keep an eye on it for the last 2 weeks lol
---
Yeah, objectively speaking reaper is worse. But people make it sound like you will be the worst player ever and you will be slowing your team down. Its simply not true. 
---
Also, reaper used to be bad when it came to builds rotations and identity in general, no longer isn't. Could it use dps buffs? Yeah why not. The only reason however for reaper buffs is because stuff like deadeye and daredevil exist, i.e, high dps with easy rotation. The thing with necro is that not only it has an easy rotation but it also has good sustain through natural tanky stats and shroud.
---
I play condi scourge at the usual condi bosses, was never kicked nor "flamed". In fact it comes pretty handy sometimes, easily giving barrier to subgroup and cleanse is more important than you'd think (for instance torment cleanse at dhuum after soul split). 
---
In sum, my point is simply that numbers are not all that matters. Reaper is **viable**. You won't lose at raids much less drag your team down with it. You're encouraged to play better professions, like Holo, but if you really like Reaper, you won't be much further behind if anything. 
---
And the "downed state" thing is true btw, from my experience. Largos, Desmina, KC, Sloth .. its always the same dudes going down. It's always a meme. I see people going down at Samarog in 200LI runs cause they're too focused to do dps(maybe they are just bad players and has nothing to do with profession, which is most likely the case, but I wonder if they tried easier classes if the outcome would be the same). 
---
Ok found the problem : windows was set to 5.1 settings while my headset is only stereo 
---
IIRC he was smaller in the final fight because we weakened him prior to it, being the IC explanation, while OOC it was scaling issues with the tech they had at the time.
---
Feelsbad. :(
---
Off topic: I have made a simple request and someone is still mad enough to downvote this. Haters gonna hate. 
---
Can you send a wiki link about the other sylvari tree I always read people talking about it but couldn’t find anything on the wiki and I probably missed it and can’t figure out which episode it was mentioned 
---
D/D thief can be either power or condi, the difference is in which skill you rely on. For power it's your #1, for condi you rely more on #3 (though the poison on #1 is still valuable)
---
I only really dislike the size of them because it prevents Anet from showing us the whole dragon like in the most recent release. I mean compare that models size to Zaithan from the personal story to PoF Kralk. I feel like they should have made the champions like Shatterer, Claw, and Teq smaller and made the actual ED slightly bigger than the champions are now. That would have let them do more with them since those sizes are more reasonable.
---
Holy shit
---
Thank you for testing, I’m working today, so I can’t reboot into Windows. Much appreciated. 
---
Both are really good! Thanks for sharing!
---
It's sad to see how few people realize this. I can and should be done with any 2 handed weapon, it saves so much!
---
It's more on the high end of things. Anet has been pushing 'serious' PvP for years, and implementing this would be detrimental to the balance of high-level games because you could very easily block all the people you usually wind up matched with.

The diving moves only count for the achievements at the end of their aftercast delay, and diving skills cancel aftercasts. So if you press one of them too soon, it will get queued and start after the previous one ends its main channeling, but it will skip its aftercast delay and the animation that happens during it.
---
So make sure to wait until the character has stopped doing the move to do the next move.
---
But sadly the game is very stale. As a 6yr player I'm quite bored of it. 
---
The community is still nice overall though. It was nicer in the beginning. 
---
I can smell your weakness.
---
Can only agree. When ppl join my groups and say they got X amount of LI, I am willing to give them a try, but if they just fake I will kick them. Honesty can work wonders. 
---
Both. Break out of explorable and your blood might freeze
---
I really wanna see a bit more damage from power herald, to push it up into decent range again
---
I kind of like Zhaitan being small if only because I think it was mentioned that his minions (i.e. the big dragons like Tequatl) were literally a part of him/his flesh. If not, then... yeah, he should've been bigger.
---
Popular opinion? There have been like 3 posts in the last few days alone complaining about them
---
I've played around with it a little bit and looks like it's close to working. There would probably be some changes needed. 
---
ArcDPS: d3d9.dll
---
Radial Mount Menu: d3d9\_chainload.dll
---
d912pxy: d3d9\_mchain.dll
---
This seems to load both Arc and d912pxy and loads some of radial mount menu. However, the menu wont open with Shift+Alt+M. My mouse snaps to the middle when I press the hotkey, but no menu appears and char does not mount.
---
They're trying to prevent people from logging in and out every 5 minutes to preserve their participation and claim pips, thus dragging out decay to receive an obscene amount of rewards. Best thing you can do is just wait a minute or 2 at the gate until the current 5 minute cycle is about to end, then hop in. 
---
Is there some third party build checker or did he just not ask him to share his build until after the umpteenth wipe and then decide it was his fault for not using meta instead of any other reason?
---
[gw2 vs wow](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2015-01-01%202019-02-02&amp;q=gw2,wow), dead game confirmed
---
Could most likely be said for any game between huge releases.
---
I am not just blindly bashing my head against this aha. I have read the wiki, practiced the animations. Hunted for more information. 
---
Have you managed to do this particular collection item?
---
I definitely get that it's the timings and intervals between button presses/channel and after-cast. I guess I just need to practice it more.
---
You have no idea how to play the game or play your character, so go do your personal story.
---
[Sure whatever](https://i.imgur.com/DiSURrG.png)
---
https://xkcd.com/522/
---
That's what honestly worries me too. We basically get to fight dragons heads now because fitting whole bodies seem impossible.
---
I don't know what to feel. Them being huge is awesome, but it does for sure restrict gameplay.
---
That sounds a lot like my setup for ArcDPS, GW2Hook, &amp; Radial Mount. I’ll gladly give up GW2Hook in exchange for a more optimized game. My hardware is super parallel (12 core HT Xeon, dual FirePro GPUs), and slugs on GW2. 
---
Just check Snowcrows whenever you want a build for raids. Discretize.eu for fractals
---
Create another character start over and level up to 80 from lvl 1
---
https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2015-01-01%202019-02-02&amp;q=wow
---
take a look at the breakouts - which are not related to world of warcraft. 
---
You know, I actually enjoyed the collection as a whole. The learning of the song and playing it. I even enjoyed the other dives because I felt like they were representative of the collection, it's just this one that seems to have me stuck and questioning the design.
---
I have done all the legy collection 1's and bolt's 2/3 which was so simple in comparison :)
---
You can also holoforge 5 with the f1 blast if the animation is fast enough if your turret is down.
---
And cheaters would block anyone better than them to avoid losing anymore.
---
I think you need to add your link in the body, as it seems to be missing right now.
---
Get one boon chrono who pumps out quickness and alacrity for your team, the other 4 can run full power chrono with maybe signet of inspiration to stack the boons higher and longer and to reduce pressure on your boon chrono. This only really works if you're quite good at what you're doing and don't need a dedicated healer.
---
Referring to the snow crows or discretize meta builds btw
---
No. Just....No.
---
Completely agree. But wouldn't it then make more sense to compare "world of warcraft" to "guild wars 2"?. 
---
While it isn't meta you could trait for the might stacking and higher capacity one if you think you're survivability is impacting your dps. It isn't meta and group content often has enough might to go around but it's an option.
---
Except for that this is not a issue in the highest tier whilst in lower tiers it is a constant problem. So i am not sure why you feel it can not be fixed were the issue is?
---
Is there a subreddit for making fun of posts like this?
---
I swear, the amount of posts/comments on reddit where the person is screaming I TOOK A COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASS is so hilarious
---
did you miss the "guild wars 2" vs "world of warcraft"?
---
Everyone who says that GW2 is dead is a moron and not worth the time do get corrected.
---
there wouldn't be a thread otherwise.
---
Honestly I hope staff is warr's next elite wep. There's a chance they might use the staff like a spear (like conjure a fiery spear-head at the end, and stab or swing with it) which would totally scratch my glaive-itch for this game.
---
gorgeous detail on the armor. The greatsword looks curved a little bit upwards, while the facial expression is odd. I'd also spread the arms more across the handle to make the sword seem heavier than an umbrella. Very nice, though.
---
Autor is  oksara.2503

Its a reference to the dialogue in The Crystal Blooms.
---
&lt;Character name&gt;: Aurene...Branded over it.   
---
Taimi: Oh no! I was worried about this.   
---
Braham Eirsson: About what?   
---
Gorrik: That, as she becomes more powerful, Aurene may exhibit behaviors more typical of her species.   
---
Canach: You mean our dragon might start acting like a dragon?   
---
Aurene: (roar)   
---
Caithe: Stop it, you're upsetting her. 
---
Canach is the eggplant.
---
Got it working, thanks. Doesn't seem to like being launched from a shortcut. Fantastic work man.
---
Path of Exile is a game where the player base doesn't seem to be declining
---
This is a pretty dumb system tbh.
---
Healing Tempest, 1 Boon Chrono, and fill the rest with power Chronos or your condi Mirages, and I really do think it would work, at least for lower tiers.  Would be interesting to see how far up through fractals you could climb, though I do think it would be more effort than normal 'comps'.  So yeah, I think if you know what you're doing you can get it to work.  
---
I haven't tried running almost all 1 class in fractals, though I used to be masochistic enough back before HoT to run all necro or all ranger dungeons just because I was proving a point.
---
I think a Warrior spec which uses Adrenaline as ammunition for fire magic would be a very interesting way to play Warrior. Especially since we haven't really had a satisfying experience yet of trying to generate of intensive adrenaline spending.
---
This feels like it should be as disturbing as the Mario Yoshi switched picture.
---
I don't think they are good villains, they are more like forces of nature. Joko was way more interesting for the brief time that he was there, because he actually had motives you could relate to.
---
If you actually do this it shows the exact opposite results. Scientifically this is a terrible and bias as all hell graph. 
---
Dont get me wrong I love the game, but using fake stats to show how good it is, isnt the way to do things
---
A new map to replace one of the Alpine Borderlands. But unlike the Desert Borderland, I want the map to be smaller and simpler. 
---
Maybe an underground city map with 3 main tunnels with various smaller tunnels that connects in between? Those who rush to defend their keep or tower can choose the main tunnel while those who want to play ambushes can run around in those smaller tunnels that connect between those major ones.
---
Kill it with fire.
---
GW2 is an action RPG.  It's all about building the experience, encounter knowledge and skill to understand and adapt your character to various challenging situations.  The crux of this is making proper dodging a core habit while you play GW2.  I'd go so far as to say that 3/4ths of your character's strengths are sealed behind your own personal gameplay.  You're not going to be carried by overly defensive gear or stats like armor, toughness or vitality for long because this is an MMO with a big emphasis on active damage mitigation and proper dodging. 
---
No difference. 250 LI now is just the same as 0 LI back in the day. Call it inflation if you will..
---
Because this way I can throw in some Valk pieces for when my reflexes fail me, giving me much more breathing room than full Zerk, and I don't lose crit damage like I did when I had Marauder's pieces.
---
Could you not
---
Delete class.
---
I use a non-default skin, I stick in the floor and my mount skins are always defaulted to the default skin and it doesn't load the selected skin until everything else is loaded. 
---
In other words -- I don't see how using a non-default skin helps. 
---
Yeah; 1 Boon Chrono, 1 Heal Tempest &amp; 3 DPS Chrono.  I'd stay away from GS and learn the pDPS rotations.  Mirage isn't very good in Fractals because many bosses phase and shrug off conditions at regular intervals.  You can run it on certain bosses that are a big HP sink, but overall, [burst based power dps](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer) wins out by miles once people know what they're doing. 
---
And Carapace gloves
---
How is ros , failing much lately ?
---
So what exactly does this thing do?
---
Row 3: you should use 5 instead of 4 at the end. If you used 4 here you cannot use it at the beginning of row 4.
---
Row 4: you are missing out on one air3 before switching to fire.
---
Row 7: i'm pretty sure that should be an f3 at the end, not an f1, you would be swapping to fire 3 times in a row x)
---
I can't see primordial stance at all.
---
Also, you're supposed to use lh4 as you switch to fire. And on fgs it is 4 fire 5.
---
Well afk is human trait. On the other side we dont have to attack afk ppl and make vid about it to feel good :).
---
&gt;Zojja passes away overexerting herself to kill a dragon in the future (ala-Snaff), and Taimi's brain gets placed in Zojja's body as her body begins fail.
---
That'd be a really weird direction to go, getting into some very strange themes for the game, I don't think it's very-
---
&gt;The bastardization of modern science previously known as Taimi hen develops a catchphrase "The student has become the teacher" and everyone groans.
---
&gt;&gt; "The student has become the teacher"
---
Confirmed. All hail our new pun-based overlord Zaimi.
---
Because you need a whole, no better two or three, cutscenes where NPCs only talk about Zojja in every episode, right? 
---
Player: Did you hear anything about Zojja?
---
Taimi: She is still recovering.
---
Player: Hey Logan, did you hear anything about Zojja?
---
Logan: Nothing new, she's still recovering.
---
Taimi: Eh.. Commander? You asked me the same question five sconds ago.
---
Player: ...
---
Player: Hey Rytlock, anything new from Zojja?
---
As a 6 year (Alpha technically) player, I am not bored. The game rocks still.  It's really up to  you to enjoy.
---
Just did the Lv80 story again last night and yeah, Zhaitan looks like a shrimp in comparison to the others, but you could see all the fine details.
---
These need to stop 
---
Well, it's not like I decided to find it boring. It just started to happen. 
---
Hopefully anet will release better content like they did in s1 and 2 of ls.
---
Living world is only 3 hours of content
---
Tamjaa? 
---
Would credit that to it being the best arpg out there, they know that the audience wants complexity and diablo caters to the casual players now.
---
The league's also add a ton of replayability every few months.
---
There's no incentive to do anything else 
---
This is just mean but it made me chuckle. OP don't do this. He's picked two enemies that give new people a lot of trouble and told you to see them out. 
---

The trick is to make it so you can only block people from being on your team not the opposing side. 
---
Correct me if i am wrong but i believe ghere are already vegetable skins. ... dont hate me pls
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
That all comes from practice and common sense. You want to use your aoes for mobs, but save the big cooldowns for the boss (unless boss isnt coming up any sooner). You want to save your burst for breakbar on bosses (breaking it gives you I think 25% more damage for 5 seconds)
---
&gt; I'd stay away from GS and learn the pDPS rotations.
---
Domi GS, hello?
---
Whoa there friend! Hold something back.
---
I disagree, if they actually said something like we're coming out with a new expansion or X feature players would get excited at the game feeling still alive. 
---
&gt; but devs definitely moved on to something else
---
I don't think that's the case. The resources are there, they're just being wasted on "cool flashy moments", which isn't bad per se. The problem is that they spend a lot of resources on little content.
---
If you want an example, GW2 spends the whole budget on 5 minutes of explosions, instead of smaller less flashy things that last far longer.
---
Wildly accurate in multiple levels across time and space.
---
Some people love creating new threads to reply to other threads instead of, you know, posting on ]those actual threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/amdqwm/what_the_hell_happened_to_primordus_size)...

 /r/Grenbur plsssss
---
The existing WvW players not shitting on anyone who dares come into their game mode.
---
On the 3 servers (Northern Shiverpeaks, Ring of Fire, Blackgate) I have tried it has been a serious problem.
---
Imagine thinking a game mode is bad because you can't shit talk people. 
---
I'd still stay away from it.  These aren't experienced players so there's too much a chance of forming bad habits. It's more important they learn how to melee imo. With GS there's always the problem of it's incredibly weak aa chain. 
---
I did not miss that, actually.
---
That also has nothing to do with "gw2" vs "wow" being fucking dumb.
---
Guild wars2 is also not the only game which uses gw2 as abbreviation so...
---
Guess they need to stop banning people for no reason then lol
