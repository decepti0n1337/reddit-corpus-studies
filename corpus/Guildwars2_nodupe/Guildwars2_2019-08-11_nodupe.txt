Well cooldowns wise it works better to just use skill 5, if you want to fit in another chapter 2 or 4 you end up having to wait a considerable amount of time for it.

Naruto running across tyria lol
---
Yea that’s the thing that kills me. In WoW I was able to make out every players casts and stuff during a raid, in this game it’s too crazy but the colors are beautiful.
---
thanks
---
Have the same keyboard and had the same problem on thief. Disabling windows key fixes it.
---
Set everything on low, slap 12 fps on it an you know how I spent 3k hours of my life.

To be honest I think to some extent people *are* hyped for class unbalances because people feel that classes have lost their identity in the retail game. Sometimes the theoretically better system or the mosy fair system isn't the most fun, especially in a game which thrives off of interaction between people.
---
Minionmancer. That's a very nice build for necro, easy to play and tough. I really recommend going with it :D
---
Yeah the same sort of thing seemed to happen with dungeons. So much optimism for the game at launch then the game went maintenance mode and the company disbanded all of the teams to work on content. Fucking weird dude.
---
Nice!
---
Sure because the community is better so they don't expect to be trolled. The fact that other games are more nonchalant about trolls is just evidence that it happens less here. People aren't inured to it. 
---

---
You seem to think it's a strength to not react to trolling as if it's wrong. I don't see that as a community strength.
---
Question is how much will be changed to make it available there.
---
Ty!!
---
I so hapyy! Thanks!!
---
Nice try, ANet.
---
Vanilla story: 3 hours (include arah p4: 1 hour alone)
---
Season 1: not playable just recap (4 min)
---
Season 2: 1 hour
---
HoT: 1.5 hours
---
Season 3: 2 hours
---
Raid wing 3 as the story bits are continuation of white mantle: organized group 30 min full clear, pug 1.5 hour
---
PoF: 1 hour
---
Season 4: 1 hour
---
Again these are very rough time estimates as I've done multiple run-throughs of my toons. If you are going for achievements, it will take that much longer, however, speed running will obvious beat my average time.
---
&gt; Housing, assuming it brings a good amount of decorations with it, will keep me busy for like 20hours tops.
---
Maybe for you, but in ESO their housing and decoration system is one of the major draws that's had me going back and playing it consistently and trying different areas of the game that I never would or don't really like. Saving up for a new place, saving up for decorations, looking at the weekly Golden Vendor to see if they have anything cool that I really like for one of my houses, looking for recipes for certain decorations, doing certain achievements/achievement lines to be able to get a certain decoration, doing dungeons just so I can get a dungeon's specific trophy head to use in my houses, and doing holiday events to get rng decorations out of their daily repeatable holiday quests. 
---
&gt; It's not like you can replay it, unless you want to destroy the house you made over and over.
---
You can though and that's what people who are really into housing systems do. People like a new place or a different style then they pick up their stuff and redecorate. It's also not something you have to destroy everything (depending on how the system works) and might just be selectively stowing certain decorations or just moving certain objects over to other parts.
---
Cool bro
---
Drink more. Think less. I. Game at least. 
---
IRL, this is where you should think more, drink less
---
No idea, never played it.
---
Yep, and statistics say that you're more likely to open thousands of boxes and get nothing than get anything good lol
---
Did we talk about disrespect? Using part of your culture as basis to create amazing games doesn't seem like disrespect for me. So many cultures are mixed around to create fantasy worlds and we don't complain. So ya, it's more about being too possessive of a culture and not wanting to share. I don't understand it cause I come from a country that is proud when our culture inspires things like that.
---
Oh no, he is HoT!
---
\&gt;brings up the problem of Requiem and Blooming armor having too much visual diarrhea  
---
\&gt;is completely sidestepped while the actual critique is ignored  
---
well there goes my hope for future armor sets...
---
Check if you have the shadow arts (check which one gives a bonus duration to stealth,I forgot the name), and trickery specs traited (for more initiative).
---
Have a dagger and pistol as your offhand and shortbow on swap. Staff is optional (I'll explain later).
---
Make sure you have hide in shadows, blinding powder, smoke screen, and shadow refuge.
---
Not necessarily in order but make sure use pistol 5 or hide in shadows *first* as those give a smoke field. Blast with shortbow 2 (don't detonate midair) or blinding powder. You can also leap with dagger 2 but since the camera changes a while back you can't leap in place so you need to move further out which means less time to use leaps consecutively. 
---
**Don't do it all at once, as stealth can only be stacked 5 times**. 
---
If you have staff I recommend you take out your shortbow. Lead with pistol 5 than use staff 5 as a leap, then blast with blinding powder.
---
I feel like I missed something so if anyone wants to add, feel free to.
---
Yea. It's definitely faster especially for early story if you're rushing. Later on you can't always speed things up anymore. Cut scene become unskippable and dialog is open world so you can't always rush ahead.
---
I finally figured it out after watching Stranger Things. It's like watching that show and wondering what New Coke tasted like.
---
I really appreciate everyone taking the time to reply and add your thoughts. I'm gonna have to work on him. I talked to him about it and he's busy until September :D. He just does not want to admit he needs to stay off his feet.
---
When twice told legend came out I mistakenly bound a fifth Quip to my account. They had me delete it and reply with the Date, Time, Character location and /ip of it when I did it. They sent me a non bound quip back in its place.
---
I mean we all run in to afk farmers in GW2 every day. There are hundreds and hundreds of them. And it is ok for them to be there. So if it is ok to afk farm in GW2 then you are not gonna be able to tell those who fish that they can not afk fish. 
---
Sorry but as long as GW2 let this things slip and feel it is ok fishing will never be ok for me. It simply will be a new way to bot farm.
---
It sound like a better option but we still have this in GW2 but you afk farm materials and your pets/turrets fix the rest. I am sure it will be possible to do the same even in the way you explain. But yeah i agree it do sound like a better way of fishing.
---
Hey thanks for the guide! In what way does the weapon have to be identical, just the type of weapon, or the stats + rarity too? Cheers
---
Yes, you must be playing this game for a year at most to type such a thing.
---
Dungeons that were not touched in years is content? That is like saying WoW has a lot of content &lt;type like this all the names of ancient raids people have done years year ago&gt;.
---
I think all those people who wanted vainilla to come back will play at most 3 months and quit or cry about anything... its not 2005... we grow up .. its not the same..
---
Really goes to show how much visual goodness we're missing out on because there's either too much other shinyness on the screen (other player's animations, etc), or the animations are so quick that it's hard to see the beautiful details.
---
I seriously thought one's gonna be gw2 and other's ffxiv
---
Why would you even post this lmfao
---
How's this wrong?
---
seriously though my game doesnt look like this at all.
---
When you're in the crafting window at a crafting station, you notice you have a list of items to make. Some of them are grey, others are orange or yellow. Each non-grey recipe you make gives you some crafting experience.
---
Farther on the left side of the window, near the top left side, you see the Discovery tab. Discovery lets you combine three to four items into another item, and discovers the recipe for that item in your crafting list. For example, if you combine a Bronze Sword Hilt, a Bronze Sword Blade, and a Mighty Green Inscription, you learn how to make a Mighty Bronze Sword. It also gives you a lot of crafting experience and a decent amount of character experience. It helps to experiment with items and see what you can make. Like, try combining those sword parts with another type of inscription!
---
It’s not necessarily *wrong*, but it’s incredibly odd to post this in the context of the character being “a bad girl.”
---
 /r/GuildWarsDyeJob
---
Very strange thread, no idea what you were expecting by posting this tbh. Like what reaction is this supposed to invoke from me? Wtf
---
I never played gw1 but I get what you mean.
---
Having actual "guild wars" with the core features of gw2 would be amazing.
---
Also joko and kralk where developed in PoF.
---
I think they all should talk, or have interesting long lasting champions that are not smaller dragons so they can be developed better. They are a little boring by themselves though.
---
any weapon is fine, as long as you have a sigil on your other weaponset, you will not lose stacks. The idea is that you'll get stacks no matter what weapon you kill with, and then replace the sigil in some way(on your primary burst/damage weaponset)
---
sorry i'm retarded and cant understand people like you :)
---
You are extremely clueless.
---
&gt;diet furry
---
Heh.
---
They are reproducing it as close to the original as they can.  From graphics to to spell batching that was used to account for shorty hardware and bandwidth.
---
What the actual fuck is this creepy-ass comment?
---
If you played GW1 then the only ties are through family names/bloodlines and the same areas. Some lore too
---
I wish I could run gw2 at this level of graphical quality + have enough frames to record not jittery slow motion clips while flying my griffy....
---
good shit
---
"when you have legendaries."
---
I agree though, looks badass.
---
I'm surprised it doesn't lock you into traits sooner.  You're doing that for might or something I imagine?
---
It also promotes ignoring everyone and playing like a single player RPG.
---
I guess part of my problem is I don't have all my HPs yet so I can't fully trait him. Thanks for the advice.
---
Neither does the novelty of new things. Wing 7 came, seemingly lowered the raid communities retention even more. Whiney posts came a month after the raid release saying "why no raids why no content". New conten sure is amazing ohh yeah... you're an idiot. It's the content in of of itself (you do play the mordy story boss fight daily??) But the features and systems that support it and raids only have 1. Get the legendary armor and gtfo.
---
God, I would be creeped out to no end if this would have been a photo of my character. But it's still creeping me out quite a bit.

---
What is NA, I only know EU
---
stuff like this shouldn't be a matter of choice
---
GW2 is even less an housing game.
---
Whether you like it or not is subjective, I agree. Whether it is even remotely related to the core gameplay of the game is an objective fact.
---
Yeah one shot builds because of bugged weapons is the most fun thing ever. The thing is, that kind of stuff is fun when the game is still largely new and undiscovered. But when it is old, that stuff simply creates a disgusting meta game.
---
But... I don't understand. If I miss old gw2, I make a new char and go leveling in core tyria. Why is that not possible in wow? Can't they visit old zones and just play them?
---
bro you just posted cringe
---
Hey, speaking for most of the group. Our builds are pretty standard fractal builds for each of the respective classes. We mostly crit cap with full berzerker gear with our 227 AR with the exception of the soul beast I believe.
---
The only other special thing about our builds is that the soul beast is running the stance share trait instead of Oppressive superiority as a soul beast would normally do in regular kills (as it allows the soul beast to do more damage when reflecting the ball attack). But as you see in the kill there was no such attack so the value of stance share is much higher than 10% damage :)
---
No you can't play classic wow in the live game, the expansion cataclysm changed most of the zones and all of the classes have undergone so many changes that none of them play the same as they did in classic. Almost nothing remains of the game from 15 years ago except a few out dated zones that are 60 levels too low to get anything from.
---
no point in new content if the game runs like shit
---
2) Generally no, all classes are good in their own right within PvE open world, though as you get into the instanced stuff (keep in mind there is no automated LFG or any kind of actual holy trinity of Tank, Healer, DPS) then you get into specific builds and archetypes, typically, classes with high demand for specific boons (gw2's version of traditional buffs that other MMOs have, though not quite the same) or classes that can provide a certain passive or semi passive effect. As for which and what, it tends to change based on need, mainly because there are multiple classes and builds that can fill the same roles or provide the same boons, though classes with specific buffs tend to be secondary (though still important) to boon generators.
---
Funny thing is, it's probably a dude holding a the mouse 😆
---
Cool outfit, but damn dude you're weird.
---
Look at the difference in average regular price 2016, 2017, 2018 and now 2019...
---
They dont upgrade celestial infusion so...
---
Looks great, wish there was the Reaper Grave Digger move in here, that animation is amazing!
---
I have to agree with both of those arguments though, I don't like subscriptions for games anymore especially in a game that has so much horizontal progression and you will get left behind if you don't play a lot.
---
However, WoW was pretty damn boring in retrospect in vanilla. All you did was run from quest to quest which was just "kill X" or "gather Y". At that time it was interesting because it was new and I got way too much enjoyment out of it than I would like to admit.
---
But still, people seem to enjoy it and if Blizzard delivers on it then let them play it.
---
Thank you Omnomnivore! thats so nice to read! I am always happy to see that there are wonderful people like you, who do truly appreciate art &lt;3

I second the choice of ranger....though full disclosure, my condi-ranger will always be my main!
---
Ah, we're going full meta.
---
Ok so first of, I do in fact understand Russian and am perfectly aware of (post-)Soviet history. You don't have to school me on this. Point is that white people are not 100% capable of judging what is offensive to non-white people, and I don't think that's very hard to understand. On the Russian point: it known fenomenon that people from the global west (which generally does include Slavic Russians) tend imagine the global east in as stereotypes. When we see something like dredge or any other stereotyped figure based on western cultures, we are aware that we are looking at a caricature. This often not the case with stereotypical portrayals of the global east. Both popular culture and academia still often see these portrayals as an accurate reflection of reality. That is the difference.
---
Now, Russia specifically is a bit of a complex case, as in the western imagination Russia straddles the border between what is 'western' and what is 'oriental'. This does make it somewhat contentious and interesting as an object of research. However, it needs to be said that Russia definitively not as unambiguously 'other' as East Asia or the Middle East (a lot things can be said about Elona as well, but I do think Anets take on MENA has been more nuanced than Cantha).
---
TLDR: I see your point, but I don't think the Cantha/East Asia-Dredge/Former-SU comparison is 100% justified.
---
Trash glyph.
---
Just tested on Superspeed Scrapper. It seems to be working fine for both bonuses. 4 seconds of total superspeed from the leap finisher, and 6.6 seconds of superspeed from a gyro.
---
If you are well versed in playing GW1, then GW2 will be a total clusterfk for your brain.
---
It is better you forget GW1, and treat this as a totally new game.
---
What is the armor on 0:18? Can somebody help me out?
---
I have a friend who is very quick to share his idea that Fury should have been implemented in an intensity-stacking manner (e.g. 1% extra crit chance per stack). Might is treated this way, so why not Fury?
---
But what if you missed the old trait system? What if you missed the days before everyone had gliders or mounts? 
---
There are loads of subtle and not-so-subtle updates that have happened since launch that would make it impossible to get the same gameplay feeling in the current year.
---
* Game is set 250+ years in *future* from the events in Guild Wars Beyond storyline
---
* You can play other 4 races beside humans
---
* There are no classic fetch quests known from 1st and other games of this kind. Here we have dynamic events - scripted encounters involving players, NPCs, environmental objects happening within certain range. Events happens periodically in same locations, sometimes require interaction with NPCs in order to start. Then, there are also Hearts - which are kind of static events that in core game you'll do once per character and in PoF expansion everyday - if you like or need for some reason. Hearts also may point to the events happening around. The orange circles or icons (shields, swords) are events markers on the minimap. Rewards in events are shared - both items and experience; as long you participate, you'll get your stuff. 
---
* The equivalent of "main quest" here is the "personal story" which is a series of instanced missions or interactions in open world that set your character in lore and events on Tyria. Initially, personal story is unique to the race and depends on the factors you set during character creation but ultimately, it leads everyone to the Big Thing in the Orr. The Living World story moves forward your character/s in lore and is also same for everyone - no matter if you're female or male, norn or human, you'll see same stuff. Still, there's one precedent with one race in first expansion. 
---
* Beside two expansions there are updates released in episodic format - Living World/Living Story. There are 3 seasons available (S2, 3 and 4) and 5th is expected to be announced on 30th; season 1 is not available as it was more of test trial anet was running back then and its content was temporary. If you log into game during one episode duration it's unlocked for you account even if you don't have the required expansion. Living Story episodes come usually with lore story happening in the new map and some tweaks to the game
---
* World is open and you can play with other players on maps; there's no need to create party to do stuff but party system still exist
---
* There are no henchmens or heroes, tho at some point NPCs will assist you in personal story but they're aren't controllable
---
* You can jump, go straight down from smallest hill without walking around, you can also glide having first expansion or use mounts that vastly change your movement with second expansion
---
* There's no districts feature anymore which is sometimes criticized. We have two physical data centers - one for EU and other for NA and you should pick one that's most close geographically to you. You can change regions - for free if you purchased full game (2 changes, one per each expansion iirc) and for small gem fee at any point in the future. You can't play with players from other region but you can still chat with them, send in-game mail, be in the party or guild but that's all what comes to interactions. The named Worlds you'll see during character creation are for World vs World PvP mode only - in the open world PvE you'll play with people from other words of one region. Game has map channels system (called here megaserver) but it's hidden to the user - each map has a player capacity number which once reach, spawns another copy of the same map and when players are leaving map system asks you to leave to more populated copy or stay and wait till map repopulates; if no action is taken, you'll be moved automatically. 
---
* There are two PvP modes - mentioned worlds fights WvW and standard PvP mode. There's no PvP in PvE. There's no GvG mode. 
---
* There's Trading Post that manages transactions among players anonymously which means there's no need to sit and monitor transaction offers. There's no direct player to player trade feature but there are ways to trade - tho, not supported officially
---
* Guild system exists but doesn't feature alliances (tho devs mentioned they do work on similar feature that would affect WvW mode). There are 3 customizable with decorations guild halls; you work on upgrades in your guild hall with your guild participating in guild missions activities - these sadly weren't changed since introduction beside small tweak. Still, it's cool to do something together if your guild needs it once a week. 
---
* There's no dual professions system (tho, there was an event running in WvW mode that allowed to steal skills of other professions) and you can't wield all weapons available in the game. You can change your playstyle with elite specializations that expand your core profession - for example, mesmer can become a chronomancer that wields shield in off-hand and has timey-wimey skills, or mirage that uses axe in main-hand and has highly *deceptive* attacks. There are 9 professions total - 3 scholars: elementalist, mesmer, necromancer, 3 adventurers: engineer, thief, ranger and 3 soldiers: warrior, guardian and revenant. Revenant comes with either expansion; either expansion gives you 1 new elite specialization. 
---
* Skills you use are determined by weapon (slots 1 to 5) you wield and what did you selected from slot skills pool (slots 6 to 0). Traits are passive abilities and can be tweaked at any time; traits also holds the elite specialization which determine if you're a core profession or expansion profession. As for skill points which you'll use to buy skills and traits - don't worry about amount or what do you unlock first because by time you reach the max 80 level, you'll have enough to unlock everything your profession can wield. Expansions elites require same work done in respective expansions maps.
---
This reminds me why early game and beta felt so great. You could really enjoy the animations, and fighting felt more visceral. Slicing a mob with sword 1 on warrior felt satisfying with the blood effect. 
---
Now it’s all so flashy that the magic of the game is kind of lost. 
---
I wish we could go back to vanilla GW2.
---
Holy....
---
just... replay the episode if you want to see that area's floating walls again? or if you simply like the aesthetic, w2 and w3 might tickle your fancy.
---
That Axe catch at the end was awesome.
---
This
---
It's just reused raid assets
---
This. I got into gw2 by two friends of mine who were hyped because they played GW1, and loved that. ... Thus they couldn't get over the fact that this game isn't a new episode for that, and left gw2 after a few months. Unlike me, because I've never had any preconceptions, I'm still here 1600 hours in.
---
I don’t think plants are tiered the same as wood/metals because cooking is significantly different than the other crafting profs. I think all plants are pretty much the same level until you start putting them together and make basic foods or ingredients (bowls, oils, vinaigrette’s) to make higher tiered foods. I could be wrong though, hopefully you get an answer, I’m curious too.
---
All the cringe aside, can anybody tell me what armor is that skirt?
---
This. That way story instance areas keep feeling at least somewhat relevant and memorable, like Fahranur or Claw Island.
---
Dead wrong on your first line, but I understand why you'd get that idea.
---
There's a fat difference between "there's nothing else to do" and "there is a shitton of other stuff to do, I'm just not interested in it."
---
Saying it the first way makes it seem like the activites just aren't there.
---
 Anything that is in game is content, most of it is just not "fresh out the oven" content. Which is normal, since the more time goes on, the more any MMO will be made mostly of old content. That's just how MMO's are, by nature.
---
Yes, but given that your starting position seems to be that it was somehow "hardcore" when being designed for casuals was literally the thing that made it popular, I don't see a reason to take time out of my day for the fruitless effort of writing them down for you
---

---
Don't even need to delete, you can always swap to another "active" discipline for 20s. The "additional crafting licenses" from the gemstore only brings your "active at the same time" count up.
---
don't know if "swap craft discipline" feature saves progress of discipline, didn't even try.
---
Don't use the Mad king's name while making creepy posts like this :(

Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Could even work lore-wise. With a mastery, you're effectively learning things from another source. So say a human learning from a norn in how to shape shift. But in that case i'd really like some added dialogue on each separate  race's mastery so you really get the idea you're learning from the race rather then activating the mastery, killing some skales and boob the snoot, bob's your uncle, you're now a master of the other race's abilities!
---
Gods we really need a slow-motion mode, or a slow motion map... or slow motion finishers.
---
Something like the low gravity in Mistlock Sanctuary, could even be just training dummies that can be used in SlowMo-mode.

Well, it depends if they're mildly interefering or not, but toe rags who intentionally ruin other people's pleasure just for the fun of it, I have no patience for. Not sure why you think defending them makes you a good guy or why people are bad because they get annoyed at them.  
---
Mind you I have some people go over the top with it, but again, it's just like trolls. It's still a tiny percentage of the community. 80 people doing the octovine, one person trolls, three or four people get rowdy in map chat. Nothing to do with how the community is as a whole.

I suggest going to PvP first and test out what you like to play within the bounds of reasonable builds before getting any build for WvW since you generally need a modified or separate gear set for WvW. That way you get used to some PvP things at the same time don't waste resources on an armor set you don't want..
---
Top tier, nice work guys.
---
I see what you did there
---
**Things that stayed the same:**  
---
- Some area names; (historical) character names; some skill names; some item names.  
---
- Dragons are super bad news.  
---
- The *core concepts* of the Mesmer, Necromancer, Elementalist, Ranger, and Warrior professions.  
---
- The 'endgame' is all about grinding for cosmetics.  
---
- LA is still your main, default meet-up place and hub.  
---
**Things that changed mildly:**  
---
- PvE is still entirely non-competitive and players are unable to screw over other players, but now it's because everybody simply gets their own loot drops rather than giving each player their own instance.  
---
- PvE can still be done mostly solo (and the main story is entirely solo) but this time it's more intended to be that way.  
---
- The old 'PvPvE' maps are now game modes within the PvP area, accessed via the menu rather than walking to a town or outpost. 'Conquest' is a loose reworking of the old Jade Quarry mechanics mixed with 'domination' modes from FPS games, while 'Stronghold' is the replacement for Fort Aspenwood. There's also WvW which is an expansion on the Fort Aspenwood idea over much larger areas and is based on server-v-server rather than just small teams. Plain PvP deathmatch is also still around.  
---
-  Though the concepts of many professions stayed the same, the variety that each profession used to have has been 'condensed'. For example, Rangers now *have* to have a pet, though there's no drawback to having one and it doesn't stop you from also being a trapper or using spirits, etc; Elementalists can use all the elements as standard without spreading themselves thin.  
---
- Assassins are now Thieves. They still perform the same tasks but they do so with new mechanics.  
---
- Giant male W/Mos in hulking all-black armour aren't en vogue like before. GW2 is 90% Victoria's Secret models wearing body glitter and drag queen dresses. If you don't like sparkles then you're in for a rough time.  
---
**Things that changed hugely:**  
---
- Charr are now your friends! Mostly.  
---
- Whereas better GW1 play was about learning which stone or slope to stand on to get a better critical hit chance, being better at GW2 hinges on *not* standing still. Jumping, dodging, and plain running around are critical skills.  
---
- Guilds now are pretty much just a way for players to more easily organise meeting up for big events. The idea of any actual 'war' between guilds is, ironically, no more.  
---
- Elite skills are now almost entirely worthless thanks to having cooldowns as long as four minutes in some cases. Your weapon(s) now dictates your first five skills, with skill #1 just being your basic attack, so get used to hitting 2-5 a lot and not mixing up your skillbar to the extent you did in GW1.  
---
- Norn are playable now but if you thought turning into a big werebear was going to be fun, think again; Norn can only transform as their elite skill and, as mentioned above, it sucks.  
---
- Trading is no longer done directly between players, though players can send items and gold to each other through mail which some people use as a work-around. The vast majority of trading is now done through the anonymous trading post.  
---
**Things that are totally gone:**  
---
- Monks are no more and there's no need for dedicated healers or protectors, though Guardians can certainly be very useful with AoE protection abilities.  
---
- Chinese gold farming bots have been replaced by ANet's own real cash=gem=gold exchange. Unsurprisingly this does mean there's a helluva lot of microtransactions pushed now.  
---
- Gargoyles. Straight-up wiped out 140 years before the events of GW2. RIP Spasmo.
---
**Things that are totally new:**  
---
- Crafting. If you just want to smash some skulls in then you can ignore it, but if you want to get rich and have the fanciest weapons and armour then you're going to be doing a lot more grinding than you did in GW1.  
---
- Mounts. If you buy the expansions then you can hop on a furry or scaly creature and run or fly around much faster, which is increasingly becoming mandatory for some group events where people with mounts can rush a boss before those on foot have caught up.  
---
- Swimming and underwater combat. It sucks and people avoid it as much as possible, but at some point you'll have to dive down and harpoon something. The main thing to remember is the second half of your skill bar might reset when you go underwater the first time, as not all land skills can be used underwater and the land skillbar and water skillbar are made separately.  
---
- Forget about superior runes of vigor or warriors tanking; health and toughness largely don't matter now. GW2 is all about maxing out either your raw power or your condition damage.  
---
- Stuns, interrupts, and crowd control are not only more common but far more severe in terms of duration and there are many bosses which will physically throw you around, pull you in, root you to the spot, or otherwise remove control from you. Prepare to get battered.  
---
**Miscellaneous:**  
---
- Link your GW1 and GW2 accounts so your GW2 characters can access some exclusive cosmetics and titles, if you got to the hall of monuments in GW1. It's the only way to get a FDS, for example.  
---
- When you make a new character you'll be prompted to make a whole bunch of choices about their backstory. This only affects the first few story missions and within a week you'll have forgotten all about them, so don't worry and pick whatever. None of it matters.  
---
- Ditto for races. Different races have their own starting area but you'll end up visiting all the others and everything converges on LA anyway. There are no notable gameplay differences between races, so just pick whoever you think looks best.  
---
- Due to how many players can be on screen rushing at hugely-detailed gigantic bosses, the game can severely chug at times, regardless of your hardware or internet connection. Don't be surprised if you get 100fps+ when you're squashing devourers in a field but drop to 25fps when zerging Tequatl The Sunless. (And even if your CPU and GPU aren't being maxed out.) There's no fix for this, unfortunately, and simply a limitation of the game's engine.
---
When WoW, FFXIV, and other MMO players are asked what they think of GW2, their reaction is "OMEGALUL", and that is for real. Is GW2 a viable competitor to WoW and FFXIV? The answer is: Not really.
---
They did not handle it well in S4.  Both the Joko arc and the Kralkatorrik arc were relatively rushed and felt wonky as a result. S4 would have worked way better with 8-10 episodes. 
---
I seriously would puke all over my desk if they repeated the exact same mistake in S5 with Primordus and Jormag. Hell, please no. 
---
And ffs please don't send off both of these dragons in S5, because many redditors currently are fed up with dragons and/or think they are a stupid central theme for this game.
---
Very nice. I wouldn't mind more slow-mo vids!
---
&gt;Fix the dialogue interface
---
There's the real issue here. They don't want to/can't fix it, so easier to just shrug off the problem.
---
I for one am hopeful. I want to see them uncover lands that we previously have never seen, rather than retread areas from GW. The world map is HUGE in images I have seen. We have not even explored half of the *continent* of Tyria yet - let alone the WORLD that bears the name.
---
[Tyria the WORLD](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/a/ac/Tyria_world_fan_map.jpg)
---
Yeah, I would love to revisit Cantha one day, but if I get MY wish, we still have many, many explorable areas to discover yet.
---
worth a laugh
---
Please no, buying more guild slot would devalue the choice of a guild. The fact that you are "offloading" guilds to alt accounts shows just that. Guild choice should be more significant. And why would you NEED more than 5 anyway. ridiculous.
---
Not if the content is just a carbon copy of all the living story episodes before it. Yay, another underdeveloped map! Yay, another map currency! Yay, another handful of super-grindy collections with no meaningful gameplay elements.
---
Sure, there are occassional blips of brightness in there, like a new mount or an actually interesting fight mechanic. But the devs lack the resources to go anywhere with these.
---
Plus with the game stuttering and chugging during combat with more than 20 players on even the beefiest machines, I'd say an engine upgrade has to happen yesterday.
---
so you just think of the absolutely normal and unaltered wiki article?🤔
---
Jesus you people should calm the heck down :(
---
Breke sounds like hero :')
---
Hey, sorry for not replying (internet issues) my current weapons are an axe, dagger and greatsword. I never really thought about the traits I use blood magic, death magic and reaper
---
without doubt, ff may get better in the endgame. but.. i wont reach it. 3 days into it, lvl 23.. im already bored so much that i probably wont log in again. the first dungeons also werent really impressive.. get in a room, aggro everything, tank it, get healed aoe it down..
---
"Farmer" Necro to Reaper, side note  isn't that the same injury that took Thor outta WSM comp few weeks  back o.O?
---
that was so cool, especially the last one
---
Why does it hurt you if some players use it as housing? Guilds can have many purpose when they are created, it can also be for decoration and creativity.  It's not inferior to making a guild solely for pvp, pve, RP etc. (and I also love creating videos of various decor ideas and placement)   
---
It's your own choice if you only want one single guild to focus on. Nobody stops you from doing that, and also nobody stops guilds from enforcing representation so I don't see why are you so hostile towards this idea.  
---
Yeah I'm well aware that you can just go to the hall entry, and it will offer you a selection of guilds from the members of the group/squad. But, this bugged out many times for us in the past, and it simply did not offer the guilds I was not a member of, even though I wanted to help.   
---
The thing is, with many guilds I can get tons of guild tokens, and tons of extra mats if they have a different node level and selection of guild mission archetype, so why not? ;) 
---
You also left out community stuff from your argument, so sadly my list is not reduced. :P    
---
I do not have a problem with your choices, but for some reason you are trying to tell me only your way is the valid way to have fun or use the game mechanics. Don't be so close minded.  
---
There is a reason why this comes up many times on the official forums too, and why people upvote it and comment.
---
Almost as big of a difference as GW1 vs GW2.
---
I do find this impressive.
---
But at the same time, (jokingly) you're the reason mistlocks'll be nerfed again!! 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But more seriously, I'm starting to feel like records are starting to need additional classifications like in the speed run community. ie: No mistlock, Unrestricted, etc
---
The RTS market is outright dead, and ARPGs are almost there as well. Blame the disasters that were SC2 and D3 for those two genres going down the toilet. They won't recover until someone takes a big risk and succeeds.
---
There's little to no improvement in adding a fluff, low engagement activity in a game that is clearly suffering in the engagement department.
---
It's a pretty shallow and inconsequential thing to ask tbh.
---
Thank you ! :)
---
Oh lovely, now you're making assumptions because you cant come with actual valid arguments. Did i say it hurts ME? No i did not, i said it was not designed as player housing. That you use it like that is on you, but NOT a valid argument for more guild slots. Also you have an obvious reading comprehension problem. I said "community stuff" is a vague argument. Mostly because the word "stuff" can be used in place of anything. making it a invalid argument point. And last but not least. There is a reason A-net has not increased or monetized the guild list. And i'll bet you a gold it is because they literally cant. Fortunately for you, and those like you. Alliances might actually be a solution. Provided of course you can find an Alliance that covers all of your desired bases.

2/10, no one of you has a sick ui overlay.

That's 5 guild slots already and I still would need a few more. PvE raids, training guild or just join my friends guild..

Some enemy attacks can be avoided that way.
---
&gt;Of all 9 classes, ele and engie are my two hardest classes to play. I'm not saying I can't play them but I die more on those classes than any other and that would likely frustrate the OP.
---
This. Ele and engi suffer from the same problem for me - too many options, too frequently a "good" build means lots of changing to another set of spells just to get "the right one" cast. It feels very artificial. I'd rather stick mostly within a single set of skills and only weapon-swap occasionally. It's not optimum, but I enjoy it way more. My own favourites are mesmer and necro, with a side-order of guardian in groups. I play all the others from time to time - but I don't feel the love for them.
---
[My Scourge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/2/28/User_Ninjazzy_Paula_Joko_20190508.jpg) uses the Exalted Shoulders for her Awakened look. You can’t see the trails here but they’re dyed with a dark gray (you can see it a bit on the interior glow) so they’re not super in your face glowy.
---
If you wanna have a shit story go for it. There is no drama, no intrigue, no wonder in the story anymore. When any problem arises, just ask Taimi or Gorrick. That must be the biggest problem with the story currently. However, given how fast the story is moving no wonder they are forced to do shit like this. More than 50% of the story is focused around killing the bad guys, and with episodes so short, they have no time for more. This is where LS2 was much better.
---
It wood be nice woodnt it
---
They won't do it no matter how much people cry about how bad it is. The only time I see them rebuilding it is part of the story doing it because players don't like it would be a waste of resources better used on living world. also theres that thing of not going back and redoing old stuff and instead focusing on new stuff. It just won't happen.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7yh18w/looks_like_la_is_due_for_destruction_again/

With Aurene now an Elder dragon, who knows what could happen. We could try to cleanse the corruption from the Dragons by having Aurene absorbing it for instance. Glint was cleansed by the forgotten and, together with her, they tried to cleanse Kralk too, but because the corruption was so immense, they couldn't do it. 
---
But now times have changed, we don't have Glint, we have a full elder Dragon with us, with magic from other dragons and a god to boot.
---
You are aware the only reason classic is a thing is because there's a private vanilla server with something like 2 million players right?
---
I'll try thinning out neck, do you think head is also a tad big? Thanks for input
---
Not my point.
---
Man this is so cool, it really lets you appreciate the quality of the animations in this game more. I think one of my favorite bits is watching the axe roll back into your charr's hand at the end there (or maybe it's just because I love Astralaria so much lol).
---
Explain the private vanilla wow server being 2 million strong.
---
Players already complain that things like kits, shroud, holoforge and similar are hiding their precious shiny weapons/armors. They are so loud that I believe we will not get any more of those.
---
Don't forget that jackal dash can also combo with leap of faith for super big jump.
---
someone said somewhere that 5 is engine limitation, not sure if true
---
Burn me, it's a stingray!

Mirage 2 was the reason I made Astralaria

Old LA good new LA bad

It looks as if he has very slim legs and a huge monster barbed cock. I like it!

Oh, our doomtroll strikes back! 
---
Today's topic: This game is bad because players are friendly! 
---
Once again I would ask you to leave this sub and/or game as well if you are so negative towards literally everything. Helpful community is bad WTF.
---
I don't think D3 is the cause for the decline in ARPGs.  If anything I would say that Path of Exile (the current genre leader) is the reason. Don't misunderstand me, I know and accept that PoE is a great game but the amount of content and development resources put into that game has makes it very difficult for other ARPGs to enter in the market and compete with them.
---
It's very similar to how other MMORPGs tried to compete with WoW when WoW was at it's peak. They failed because that WoW had more content and player investment (that, and everyone tried to copy the formula without adding anything new, kinda like ARPGs now).
---
Would rather see included as part of a full map there someday
---
Weekly circlejerk on this sub
---
I don't think those are the same. You can always make goals for yourself, but there isn't really any end to it.  
---
What do you get for completing the entire wardrobe? Nothing.   
---
I could make a goal to do all map completion on all classes and races but in the end, i haven't really worked towards anything. There's a lack of these huge goals that i've given examples of.
---
As a fan of stances.. this makes me smile lol
---
hey thank you so much! yeah I can't wait to see what they announce
---
Damn boi, seems like NA pve is not dead after all. GG.
---
Thank you so much.
---
I'm only playing two MMO's atm. Elders scrolls online and Guild Wars 2.
---
I easly get a burn out from a game. So when that happens I just switch from one to the other :)
---
That guild existed as a community hub for friends even before HOT :D   
---
yeah I have at least two of these, because I'm part of multiple circles. I don't consider this an overkill, you are playing an mmo mostly to interact with friends and new people (at least for me it's partially for that)   
---
The only reason though that we fought to claim a hall and level it by ourselves was the decorations. I simply love playing around with the interior of the place to make something nice where we can chill and offer recipes and upgrades for friends or temporary guest.  I do not want a housing system, but I'm interested in what they created and I use it with my friends. Why is this an issue?   
---
You say this is an overkill, but I don't agree, because a lot of players face similar issues like me.
---
Old LA had so much fun and character.  New one is so bland and boring
---
Somehow I feel like if ArenaNet tried to make a horse mount it would look really awkward and out of place.
---
Horses have always been a mistery of the game. 
---
In Guild Wars 1, you had undead riding dead horses, the Necrid Horsemen. Then you also had the 4 ghostly riders of Dhuum. But we never got to see a living horse. Either they have all gone extinct and what we saw were just the reanimated remains, or there's a bigger mistery to uncover...
---
DH has more survivability than FB, actually. DH runs the heal "Litany of Wrath" which is a low cooldown full heal (it heals you based on damage dealt, so it always fully heals you if you're attacking). Also, DH has a ~3k group heal on its F2.
---
FB has an edge in that it has very frequent aegis application with its mantra heal, but DH has a "block everything for a duration" skill on its F3 to compensate.
---
Go with Firebrand.
---
Take a look at the quickbrand builds too, that would make you more useful for any group. But regardless, if you feel more confident playing power fb, then that will work better that picking a spec that may let you deal slightly more damage, with the cost of getting downed often and having more troubles in doing your rotation in place.
---
PD: Firebrand gives you +250 toughness.
---
I have read about a "no shatter" Mirage build but I can't seem to find it in most search places. May anyone link me to the build for it? Is this build still applicable to the recent game version?
---
How exactly do i know the chances of being undercut on a sell order for an expensive item on gw2bltc?
---
[This item](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/87061-Nightingales-Music-Box-Tradable) by the way, would appreciate some help, i'm afraid of getting undercut
---
Seeing the graphs i basically know that: today 1 was sold, past 3 days 2 sold and 2 bought. Past week had more buys than sells tho.
---

---
Lol. Reminds me of the time that a zerg that I was in climbed to the top of SMC and glided in for an aerial attack on an enemy zerg trying to break through inner. They had no idea wtf happened.
---
In real game this guy just perma engages targets that can take those Dmg and remain stealth against others
---
Just an anti-PVP Vidz.
---
Don't be surprise this game mode is dying. :)
---
I like it how in many design decisions gw2 is not another mmo with horses, paladins and wizards. From that point of view, Tyria feels different than other fantasy worlds.
---
Exactly as it says. Scan through your equipped armor, weapons or trinkets and see if there is one that doesn't have any stats. Double click on it and select a stat from the list.
---
Given that I played WoW back during the Burning Crusade days, and that WoW took the vast, vast majority of its mechanics from Everquest, I'm really not in for a big surprise.
---
You have an old armor or trinkets with stats that have change or no more aviable, or just new so anet let you choose the new set of stats in a choice list.
---
You are forgetting we don't have classes like that in GW2.
---
Rangers are the mostly common as an archer class in other MMOs, but we aren't tied to our weapons, so wouldn't make sense since other classes use bows as well, even WARRIORS.
---
Yeah let's put the most generic mount in the game. That's what really missing.
---
I mean, they're wrong. ANet absolutely has control over your data in their database. They just don't want to make the effort since it would be much more trouble than the usual procedure.
---
No you don't sound rude, so don't apologize. Rereading my comments I realized I sounded pretty butthurt, so I'm the one who is going to apologize in this situation. Sorry :D   
---
You both have valid points, and if the system won't get expanded it's not the end of the world of course. It's just something that would be nice for special cases similar to mine. But I know there are many other more pressing matters they should address first. This is just something for the bottom of the list. Hope dies last. :D
---
sb have such telegraphed atacks that any thief playing with 2 hands shoud destroy you within  2 mins. 20 sec if you gona do some mistake.
---
1. Minimally as racial skills are mostly novelties. Sylvari have a few extra interactions in Heart of Thorns. 
---
2. Honestly, play the one you enjoy. The raid and top end fractal/dungeon favours either druid/chronomancer or renegade/firebrand and warriors are always welcome. In PvE, though, all classes have a place. In WvW, rangers have a hard time getting into organised squads and the meta for that is a whole other beast entirely. 
---
3. The expansions cost money and the elite specs (subclasses, basically) are usually a bit of an upgrade over core, but other than that no. Almost everything on the shop is a convenience item or a skin.  
---
4. In-game, it's mostly a "play on your own with others" affair, but people tend to help each other out. It's rare that someone walking past won't stop to rez you, for example. The open world stuff favours large squads for zone-wide events and they tend to be run fairly well. 
---
5. Create a character, complete the tutorial then go into PvP - they'll be as though they're level 80 with everything unlocked. If you get a level 80 boost you can test your character out in one of the level 80 zones and it's not final until you leave.
---
&gt;Also... I am a graphics lover... so the old-style stuff does not work for me.
---
And yet you play GW2.
---
There'd not be much point. It's its own map, so that's all there is to it. It isn't really worth making it a persistent zone.
---
That was my impression as well, although I do not appreciate it as much as you do.
---
PvE or PvP? 
---
The build isn't really too different - move traits that affect shatters onto something else and spam ambush attacks whenever you can is the crux of it.
---
The moment you realize Blizzard's entire franchise line is nothing but rinse and repeat nostalgia cash grabs or blatant rip offs.
---
That's quite the penis.
---
I think FB is more QoL as the free Quickness speeds up gathering and interacting with things a lot and you have other stuff like free AoE pulls and reflect domes that come in handy. However, for good Quickness spam you usually use the Mantra heal which means that you don't take Litany of Wrath and just spin to win with it. 
---
On the other hand, with DH you usually take Litany of Wrath which allows you to dps freely for its duration and the cone block from f3 which also serves a similar purpose. So between the two DH can actually survive easier against heavy pressure, but for instanced content unless most of your partymates are dead I think DH would not have a significant advantage over FB in survivability (usually attacks are not directed at you but AoEs you can dodge/block).
---
So for open world I don't think it matters too much, and in instances it will depend on party needs. The gear and builds for both specs are almost identical so you can swap whenever, just get a few Diviner trinkets for FB to stack more Quickness.
---
Well, lorewise it would be quite a stretch. There are not many things that can truely shapeshift in and out. Norn can, but with all the other races? Human druids were able to transform, but they are not capable of returning as far as I am aware. I will not say it is impossible but it is very unlikely at best. On the other hand are we using tonics and transformations all the time so ... maybe? :D
---
The entire reason classic is coming out is because Blizzard hasn't had an original idea in 15 years.
---
Ok thank you
---
I hope this doesn't offend, there's something about the style that is giving me a "King of the Hill" vibe.
---
Anet artists: “We need to redo LA *again!?*”
---
&gt; The language is missing it's mysterious charm other languages will have (and is quite fitting for fantasy worlds) because you associate those other languages soley with things you choose to use them for instead of using them by default. 
---
I disagree here.
---
The words miss their charm because they choose them badly. Too much stuff sounds like they just translated it 1:1, instead of considering sound and semantics. It would we possible to create more atmosphere, but you have to choose the right words.
---
Unrelated example. For "black hole", you could translate it simply as "schwarzes Loch". That's what gw2 translators would do most likely. But you got other options as well, such as "düster" or "dunkel", instead of "schwarz" and "Grube", "Grotte", "Höhle", instead of "Loch". (or of course even more variations) But you have to chose carefully what fits best and that is - as stated in a different comment - an art for itself.
---
For PvE. I haven't really played PvP since a long time now.
---
Beautifully executed. M.O.X. was the dawn of a new era for me in Guild Wars. Love it, semi-jealous, &amp; now nostalgic.
---
That is a big ass dong.
---
I obviously didnt finish nightmare court pants so it ended up looking like this. It wasnt my intention x3
---
.. or did it?
---
Horses are also talked about by NPCs in game, specifically as ride able animals.  Just because the devs never bothered to model horses doesn't mean they don't exist.
---
Thanks for the clarification, looks like I'm gonna try out DH then.
---
As a composer myself: this is insane. What program did you use and what VST libraries? I'm literally blown away, that's definitely soundtrack quality. Keep it up!!!
---
I'd pay 400-1000 gems to get old LA as an option
---
Sounds good. Just a question though, when you already have quickness up and apply another quickness, does it add to the total duration of the buff or just refresh it? Should I pop Feel My Wrath and Mantra of Potence together or wait till Feel my Wrath runs out?
---
well i play guardian in t3 fractals with random pugs and mostly without a healer/support and i have to say that i prefer DH. FB (quickbrand) is great when you have good players in your party but if your group is struggling to stay alive DH lets you put out more dps with less support. open world content it depends: by myself i still prefer DH (but i switch some traits for extreme survivability: i use 121 in DH) but again if i'm with other people and quickness is lacking i usually switch.
---
TBH I prefer using blinding powder in the smoke field over shadow refuge, as that still grants aoe stealth, is a blast finish for more AoE stealth, is a stun break, and doesn't require you to stay standing in the skill to get maximum stealth from it (about 11s when traited with shadow arts)
---
It adds to the duration. Up to five different sources of quickness can stack together at once, but it's incredibly rare to run into this limitation except when Mesmers use Time Warp. So for all intents and purposes, quickness just stacks in duration seamlessly.
---
Lurkers then probably.
---
They give no reason and just downvote because they don't agree with you, which should be against the rules (Most subreddits have that rule).
---
Ah, I see you are also an Asuran thief of culture
---
How high are you right now?

Oh stop it what an idiotic post. Especially the title it is so factual and at least make an effort to say when you played or the server and base it on your experience. I jumped in randomly and we were talking wildly in map chat and team chat. A commander came and we joined and overtook many places. It was very fun and there was discord as well. So please stop generalizing and saying oooh it’s all dead and no one wants to do this wahhh.
---
It really is
---
I think its really good. I should have mentioned that. Just something about the art style though feels somewhat stylized. I can't put my finger on what.
---
"not have forced cosmetics"(?) :D lol whole game is pure cosmetic explosion in toystore! now I have one bow that looks like Ikebana , but ok ...I understand your oppinion. anyway ...I like GW2 much more then other MMO games because it have deeper story, and avatars looks pretty descent and possible. (at least first 80 lvl) Maybe I am "oldfashioned" guy
---
Ah ha ha ha!!  Fair, damn point.

Less lately, however, since I moved to the UK and all my raiding groups are US based.  Dunno that I want to pick it up again or not.

The whole ARPG genre plummeted after the D3 fiasco. Overall interest in the genre just died out. We went from having multiple releases at once, to many of them not even releasing.
---
Big titles affect how genres do, if they do well, lot of companies can grow under their shadow, if they fail miserably, they take the whole genre with them. D3 was so disgusting and so disappointing many people just quit the genre for good, no matter Torchlight, PoE, and others were doing pretty well.
---
I don't think PoE is to blame for the current situation, they were just lucky to survive the onslaught. If something, they're the ones keeping the genre alive.
---
The RTS genre wasn't that lucky, and it's just dead.
---
That was hell of impressive. Next time my team wipes out im gonna tell them that we are supposed to do it under 1 minute
---
I feel weirdly turned on when I see a mirage getting insta downed with a backstab crit like that.
---
unequip that weapon, double click, select stats you want, re-equip the weapon
---
Nintendo would like a word.
---
What makes this area more remote than some other waypoints in, say, Kryta? I'm 100% positive it's possible to make 2 seconds-long video without any other people there at any point in time on any map. And u/that_shaman has a solid history of vague clues on the verge of some bigger announcements. Tin-foil hat it of you want, now I'm certain s5 will be or at least start in Far Shiverpeaks.
---
I was gonna say a hatless Dale Gribble, but yeah. Boomhauer works.
---
It's at least as old as New LA, just hang around Fractal Gate a bit and you'll know why :)
---
Yes, it is.
---
^This. 1000x this.
---
HoT is better than PoF so yeah
---
Honestly some would probably argue HoT is more valuable than PoF. Its maps are still populated, people still do the metas. Gliding is incredibly useful for exploring. The story itself is decent enough, not to mention you get access to an entire new class and 8 new specializations, some of which are still considered meta even with the new PoF specializations. So yes, really I cant imagine anyone having to pick one or the other both Xpacs are wonderful additions still to this day.
---
PoF and HoT were designed to make the greatest experience this game can possibly offer when combined. Gliding was game changing, we could jump off a cliff and escape battle without dying and fly around all over with the updrafts in these insane maps (the HoT maps are the only maps like it in the entire game, and the season 3 maps were so varied and different it was amazing going to each one the first time). 
---
and THEN pof came out, and changed everything AGAIN. going back to the heart of thorns maps with things like the jackal and bunny were just so awesome, but then you get the griffon and it changes everything AGAIN FOR A LITERAL THIRD TIME. the griffon is what made PoF borderline legendary for me because since launch the majority of the community agreed that there was no good way to implement mounts in a game that wasnt designed for them, and then Anet just said fk it and literally lets us fly now, and its the fastest thing in the entire game. Getting the griffon made me truly look back and appreciate how far this game has come. Sitting from atop places in the Core tyria maps that i had always dreamed of standing on just felt so awesome and nostalgic. And then they released 2 more insane mounts for the fastest ground speed and a more precise but slower flying mount that when combined with the griffon is a literal fully featured flying experience that makes WoW's flying mechanics look like they were coded by sleepyheads during a hackathon tournament.
---
basically, get HoT for sure. HoT and PoF were made for eachother
---
I love the expression and jade earring! Great Canthan addition!
---
lmao
---
oh alright
---
oh that's cool
---
Incredible trailer!
---
Im not a fan of teapot but thank god hes single handedly holding the competent  raiding community together
---
Tanks that can live through 3+ players 
---
Silvers getting matched with platinum +
---
A deadeye is the least of my problems, so easy to fight. 
---
Dont know how? The problem lies in you. Just a reminder champ
---
Back when PoF released they changed it so that Revenant would not only be a HoT-feature but instead an expansion-feature meaning that you can play rev as long as you own at least one expansion.
---
I see Dale as well.
---
Great job on the trailer Teapot, and what a great prize pool...
---
Last ERP was very fun to watch, hope this one is even better and brings lots of new Twitch viewers who are left wondering why they never heard of GW2 raids before.
---
Good luck to all the guilds participating o/
---
he did it again Pog
---
AMAZING
---
They probably would ignore it because one of the promoted guilds has "cucks" in the name.
---
Hi Officer, I'm Dad?
---
PogU hype!
---
Guild Wars 2 and Anet don't deserve your efforts.
---
They already refused any support for the event
---
Amazing! You have some real talent. The VSTs sound stellar too
---
Truly an honor to witness the raiding scene back to its glory and tbh I can't emphasize how much recognition teapot deserves for his efforts, he stands as a symbol of commitment and dedication in contrast to a gamemode that's looked down upon and considering how long the release times take and how little of tools he has to work with its incredible how he manages to make it work in an exceptional quality level regardless, very appreciative of his contributions and I hope he gets the love he deserves for all he's done
---
Only 6 guilds? Seems rather low compared to the previous edition.
---
- park all your characters near the easier hearts
---
- use [TACO with tekkit's markers](http://tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/gw2-taco/download) for farming routes of the LS4 maps
---
Why the last? He's not really quitting is he?
---
That's what happens when anet forgets about raids, majority of the top raiders leave for something else
---
XDDD
---
he is going to Wow Classic
---
They know exactly what they're doing.
---
This is breathtaking!
---
ty &lt;3
---
It is a very conscious, deliberate, and meme choice
---
[Source of music used in the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL7IRngzIdk) (2WEI - Toxic)
---
I counter your argument with a crudely drawn picture of a charr
---
Nobody wants to know how anymore dude.
---
Haven't you understand it yet ?
---
All the casuals told people stop playing, so they did.
---
:)
---
Who doesn't enjoy some intense, competitive ERP?
---
Hype but at the same time depressed since this will be the end :Pepehands:
---
This is sick. You're quite a talented artist man. Good shit!
---
Well not really watched anything on twitch ever but this trailer was so fucking amazing that I might consider it for these days.
---
And look at his face. He's literally proud of it :D
---
Less guilds makes me sad. Last ERP was great fun from start to finish. This will be a lot less tense and chaotic :( 
---
Still gonna watch.
---
A fucking *Toxic* cover. Incredible. 
---
GL to all the competitors, and a huge thanks to Teapot and everyone who donated!
---
Is this the fabled ArenaNet Marketing team?
---
thank you 😁😁😁
---
This, I like.
---
Wallpaper &lt;:
---
I see no picture &gt;:(
---
living story\*
---
you mean ever
---
A lot of the raiding scene is. W7 was much easier than it should've been, even with it's pretty great boss design it was the nail in the coffin. When so many casuals respond to any type of criticism with 'just quit lol' eventually people will.
---
You won't see your weapons, but you will see the swing weapon effects.
---
Like in one of those old 'first person' JRPGs that showed just the slash effects when attacking enemies.
---
What a joke
---
Most glass cannons have only like 12-14k hp
---
The ascended one was free because of the free vision crystal
---
crafted 2 exotics cause you needed to craft astral for the achievement to start but  I crafted 2 instead of 1. Can you upgrade the exotic one into a ascended one? Not gonna use the exotic and all I can do is salvage it...
---
Why would you want to ride half a centaur?
---
Not using a selfade camera "hack". It changes camera in "free mode" for him so have more cinematic caster options. (caster would be /gg the whole fight but able to manipulate his view that it works like a camera drone)
---
Tpot leaving GW2 with a bang. I'm a casual player nowadays but Teapot always got me hyped and logging in every now and again.
---
Make it a bullet point list so they can get it step by step.
---
* You have equipped an item that had selectable stats when you obtained it.
---
* An update has reset the stats on that item.
---
* That item will now have no stats until you select them again.
---
Any of the Guild Buffs affect Raiding? (Karma/Magic Find/XP)
---
You could've gone with "I love the pyro gloves! They're so bad..", but instead you wasted a perfectly fine pun opportunity.
---
maybe they did not anything about is because people don´t really play in first person which means it bothers not many people which also means it has either not been noticed or it is very low on the priority list
---
"Just take a break from the game if you are not happy."
---
Is why.
---
To people asking: since ever only tournaments consisting of at least 8 teams are officially supported by ArenaNet. Since there is not enough participating teams, this event will not be officially recognized and supported with prizes.
---
A not so legal camera tool.
---
Not using the third party camera tool. 
---
The offer was: We will give you a host on their Twitch channel + a retweet on twitter + some prizes, but you may not use any third party tools.
---
Teapot's answer was: The camera tool is too important to give up. It will make the viewing experience 10 times better. We need it, so, thanks, but we won't need the offer. 
---
Anet's response was: Oh ok. Some of our developers on private account will still contribute to the prize pool tho, so enjoy ^(this is NOT official, it's only from what I heard, take it with a grain of salt). 
---
It was not a very aggressive process at all. Anet couldn't officially support a third party camera tool, even if it is available only to 1 person. They did support it unofficially tho I think. 
---
Note: last year teapot pulled perspectives from the players participating which had a ton of problems such as: 
---
&gt; Double compression
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; fixed perspectives/loading screens
---
&gt; lag
---
&gt; low resolution
---
the solution was a new third party tool that will allow for 1080p 60fps free camera perspectives, which in this case could not be given up.
---
So is WoW Classic releasing very soon.
---
I don't blame, just the thing is that the first episode of the season was released November 28, 2017. Almost 2 years.  
---
Also it was clearly expected that we will need all currencies of each episode as it happened with Aurora crafting.
---
Yes, when you unlock a mount it is unlocked accountwide so you can use it on any character. However you will still need to go through the tutorial mission on level 1 which is an instance and you can't use mounts there but once you're through that you can use any mounts you've unlocked \^\^
---
dont choke on the tea

[http://dulfy.net/2017/09/24/gw2-griffon-mount-collections-guide/](http://dulfy.net/2017/09/24/gw2-griffon-mount-collections-guide/)
---
You can cross reference the achievement screen with the dulfy griffon guide or the wiki for map locations.
---
I still wouldn't mind if you could get more than a few pieces per character a day, also the mining nodes these have are completely pointless to me. Fuckin Mistonium node and has no mistonium THEN **DON'T NAME IT MISTONIUM**, call it like dragonite node or whatever really, it gives you its currency like one time out of 20. 
---
Kralkatite ore was the best imo, it was fun, fast and relatively easy to gather a stack of it and wasn't mindless character swapping and doing the same few hearts over and over for 5 pieces of currency.
---
I enjoyed the saddle collection, but I absolutely despise the way the currency gathering is limited on most of the maps, absolutely boring and limited.
---
ERP is still alive in these uncertain times! Lit!
---
Well, it is under rare collections, or just search "Open Skies" and they should all show up.
---
Amazing trailer! Looking forward to the ERP!!
---
Oh no, vote brigade is here. :)
---
Oh. Well that's disappointing.
---
Imagine not being on stream when Bik is in voice chat.
---
damn exposed
---
Less...actually.
---
How does arena net handle item refunds? I got an endless upgrade extractor from a black lion chest and am still a relatively new player so i used it to receive the account bound extractor. I now realize that I missed out on 1900 gold and that kinda hurts to think about. Is it possible for Anet to be kind or is it most likely for them to say no to returning the contract and deleting the extractor?
---
If Teapot is racist, I don't know who isn't
---
whens the last time ANet supported anything other than the gemstore
---
You say that as if other classes aren't absolutely obnoxious. To name a few: Bunker firebrand, bunker weaver, burn guard, warriors that can literally dodge everything... Mesmers are NOT the only annoying class out there.
---
Post this trailer to general gaming subreddits too, try to gain more traction, you deserve the views for all the effort
---
So cool!!!
---
How is bik relevant? Also he's a clown and it's 100% irrelevant to anything related to this.
---
But there are no minorities in his trailer! The fat pink-haired cows at ArenaNet will not be amused.
---
Teapot isn't only person participating in stream. Never said that "Teapot is racist". I would say that few of his more or less frequent guests are.
---
yeah it was the original idea, pitched by I think AnetBen, but he left the company and iirc Anet went pretty dormant on it
---
Can't be much worse than forgotten imo
---
horses are from earth. its the year 2 million, earth is done but the few who consolidated all the power and technology in the world became space faring gods that took their last doomsday plan for humanity and moved it to a new world: Tyria. everyone remember horses, but they forgot to bring them
---
That's really sad. :/
---
Unless there's technical issues with it (which I can see happening for sure), that's a small thing ANet definitely could've done.
---
Unless drops were removed and it was just for fun, they'll be turned into automatic farming rooms.
---
"In real game this" build is trash, used by trash players to kill other trash players.
---
buy the currencies every day in dragonfall and when you feel like it do events in one of the ls4 maps. the rest of the time just forget you're doing this collection and someday you will have everything (it took me 2 months and a half to get the mount but it didn't feel like a grind at all).
---
Deleted in 3, 2......
---
Is that not why hes moving over to WoW Classic, he will probably get 10x the viewers, Anet will have to ask peachy to cast 2 times a month now, to try keep numbers up.
---
Downvote. Another troll or an idiot and pointless post.
---
Nice joke. It almost made me laugh.
---
Enterprise resource planning
---
Streamer is responsible for 100% things that are part of their stream. I don't care if you want to go with "heheXD meme Bik rant XD" reasoning.
---
Britney impact, #FreeBritney (from her conservatorship that she has been under for a decade even though during this decade she has released 4 albums, toured the world 3 times, had a lengthy Vegas residency, countless music videos, and countless perfumes).
---
No comment...
---
Top 1% of the population has people leaving.  GAME IS A GHOST TOWN.   /sarcasm.
---
So because he has a friend that stupid you blame the entirety of it all as recist etc etc. Sounds reasonable ahahaha.
---
&gt; but see, on those nothing actually tests your skill, only how well you can dps a boss, that why raids are easy and generally boring to watch, while other pve instances let you minmax and test your limits, which is much more impressive imo
---
Praise dungeons. Fuck gw2 raids.
---
I picked that up as soon as the music started and came here to inquire if my spider senses were correct
---
No Final Fantasy Pog
---
I think everyone assumed I meant "anet supports only pve" when that isnt the case. I specifically was sad that people in the community care about pve raids far more than pvp and wvw. 
---
I guess that didnt register here though. Oh well.
---
How so?
---
Also, at some point you stop getting experience for crafting things below your level (the names turn grey) when that happens you can no longer get more experience from crafting that item.  Good luck!
---
Thats been a recurring issue I've had with LW content in general. The best way to farm Mistonium is the rift events, but the zone is more or less barren now that most people don't need it anymore. Don't get me started on Istan's quartz dust you can't even efficiently gather solo... At least there's farming squads occasionally but even those dropped off, too.
---
It's not about 'owning casuals' at allas you appear to suggest. It's just about being extremely disappointed with the state of the game, and then people telling you to 'go play another game it's not for you' while you've been playing this game for a long time and have seen how good it was in the past.
---
If a large part of the vocal community downplays all your problems with the game by saying 'go away we dont need you', especially when pretty much all guides and out of game content are made by those guys they're telling to quit, people just grow apathetic and do quit.
---
Enduring years of increasingly less support for your preferred gamemode with promises of increasing support that has never actually happened, plus all given feedback for said mode being responded to with 'go play another game', people will give up on giving feedback and the game soon enough.
---
Anyone has an idea how are made the camera shots of the boss ? :o
---
I want to know how they gathered this footage! Is there a free cam that I don't know about? I'd love to get sweeping crane shots like these, they're beautiful.
---
The third annual Erotic Roleplay. nice
---
While Zojja was cut from early Season 4 plot in the episode rewrites (she was supposed to be [kidnapped during the original Episode 2](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/45957/destinys-edge) by a planned villain, most likely Phlunt given the clues from [that_shaman's datamining info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpc898/a_glimpse_at_how_the_story_changed_at_the_start/)--and I for one am glad Phlunt wasn't revealed as some secret Inquest villain as he works better as an obstructive bureaucrat on the heroes' side than as an Inquest mastermind), I wouldn't be surprised if we see her return in the future after some recent events referenced stuff relating to Zojja's old rivalry...
---
During the revised Episode 2's Specimen Chamber meta, we encountered [Overseer Kuda](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Overseer_Kuda) who oddly had Zojja's facial features and more importantly was working on controlled dragon minions (even referencing the lore of Crucible of Eternity's crosscorrupted minion Subject Alpha by introducing us to the simulacrum of Subject Beta) while revealing that this research may be linked to her unnamed father, before she escaped with the combat data we had so graciously provided for her. If said father turns out to be the late Kudu (which seems a high possibility given Kuda's name, and the crosscorrupted and controllable dragon minion experimentation), Zojja should have every reason to get better to attempt to stop the daughter of her archenemy from realizing Kudu's ambitious plans. :)
---
Dw, you won't have to worry about that because it'll be EG in the finals.
---
Giving code for old content to players for bugfixing and just trusting them to not do anything stupid with it is an established concept? I'm curious which MMOs you play.
---
Often you can get a bit of help from 1 or 2 people and form a group to get story step 1 in PoF finished.  Ask in guild or in *cringe* LA map chat.
---
Absolutely amazing.
---
If you have time, make sure to check out the stream on the 24th/25th, and check out Teapot's normal streams in general. After so many years, he's still streaming basically every day, providing content where there really isn't any for the community. 
---
This trailer only goes to show how much effort Teapot puts into not just this Tournament, but the community as well, and we really need to make sure we appreciate this. I cannot wait for the ERP, its going to be amazing, and I hope to see you all there. Good luck to the Guilds playing, and thank you for everything as always Mr Mighty Teapot. 
---
Also, sub for free with Twitch Prime :) 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/mightyteapot
---
Too bad that's not something they'd do anymore.
---
Haha no worries. Public dungeons can actually work, but I doubt they would at this point in development for GW2.
---
PogU
---
Sad Ben A (the fractal Ben) isn't here anymore. He would have loved to see this.
---
that make sense! :)
---
Didn't see it in the other comments but you don't need to be level 80 to join the story. 
---
Just group up with someone else and at the end of the mission you accept credit for it and you will have a shiny raptor to travel the world with.
---
Yeah I know, it's super cool.
---
Ohhh tpot just released 8 raidwings? I must have missed that.
---
you are aware that stuff on that server is not all like it was in vainilla ... they used made up numbers sometimes because they didint know.. thats why there are people now that cry about it when something is not the same as the private servers... they dont even remember how it truly was
---
Not as spectacular as the other one, but still great nonetheless. You really got the artstyle right.
---
I'm glad you asked. By simply linking your Amazon Prime account to your Twitch account, you unlock the amazing and wonderful ability to sub to a single stream, once a month, 100% COMPLETELY FREE. I think you know what to do now ;)
---
amazing what first person camera and a bit of gliding can achieve. can't wait for the for the tournament!
---
There would be a variety of quality to dungeons.
---
There would be shitty levels. But from what I see in player generated content in the games I've played, there would be great level that sifting through the bad levels worth it.
---
Ooh very good suggestion! I saw my friend play on better graphics and it felt really good. My pc is pretty good but not optimized for the game I think the graphics would enhance my experience greatly.
---
Moto legend with Super Adventure Box themed abilities
---
I remember when WoW came out and it seemed so outrageous that you could get to the level cap in it in just two months.  Meanwhile on the MMO I played at the time, it took an average of a year to do so.
---
Mixed feelings, great job on organizing this, making the trailer etc. And also great job on the people that decided to sign up.  
---
I know from experience practicing for these kinds of events takes a lot of time and effort and thus should be highly appreciated.  
---
And that’s probably also one of the reasons people aren’t signing up as much as well as the fact the raid community is simply smaller than it used to be.  
---
But like I said, mixed feelings. The raid scene is slowly dying and this will most likely be the last raid tournament in GW2 we’ll ever see and that honestly makes me genuinely sad and emotional.  
---
And I have to say the blame is fully on Anet for destroying the raid design team and not openly supporting this tournament just because it has a silly name. Honestly that’s really scumbaggy considering how much good these kind of events do for THEIR video game. And how much effort Tpot and his lads put into this.
---
Yes it took a lot of time but when you don’t rush it and just go through it day by day you’ll get there soon enough.  
---
And the best thing, your mount will actually feel valuable because of what you had to go through to obtain it. And you’ll be rightfully proud to show it off at any point you can.
---
Kappa
---
In fact I don't miss that :) (reminds me on american superheroes) But , yes ...it is also part of a important gaming props.
---
Mods
---
They should make the salvage material spread wider, including T1 to T6 materials, like how the Unstable salvageable trophies from S3 can give materials from all 6 tiers. 
---
That way salvaging could be an option.
---
There are quivers in game, I have the gemstone version as well as the Ascended version made in the mystic forge.
---
Next you are going to tell us that a professional promo video climaxing with a 10 second shot of a Djinn's idle animation set to colorful relaxing music doesn't excite you to check out raids SMH. Kids these days.
---
Do they know they share an acronym with Erotic Role Play? Not familiar with the group at all.
---
The trailer is amaizng, good job on that  
---
sadly the gameplay is gonna be lacking with only Lucky noobs and the leftovers of snow crows and quanitify playing as Snowify, the rest are a bunch of plebs, its expected tho as a huge part of the gw2 raid community already quit for other games in this past year 
---
Still hype to watch the last big raid tourney of the game most likely
---
because i broke you in your feeling , what it sounds like to me rano user?
---
i try
---
Well, no, some people are saying the community is better than other MMOs. People who present contrary opinions are disgreeing with that assessement.
---
Sure you can complain against annoying individuals, that's fine. But in this place, when you do it, you're disagreeing with the whole premise.
---
I've played a whole lot of MMOs. There aren't many MMOs I've played where the community over all, is more helpful or better than this one. 
---
Does that excuse the exceptions? Nope. Doesn't excuse them.
---
Does that mean that bringing up the exceptions in the way you did isn't off topic if you agree with the original post, which I do? Absolutely. It's called context.
---
PvP and grinding all hearts on all characters is how I did it.
---
Really helps to have a full LWS4 Tome book in an account-shared slot.
---
Umm I don't agree with you on that and I think that's misuse of the word toxic. Upvotes and downvotes really aren't a big deal dude. Just means most people who've read your comment didn't agree with it I guess. Nothing toxic about it because it has no bearing on your ability to speak your mind.
---
&gt;Eu gostei da coleção de sela, mas eu absolutamente desprezo a forma como a coleta de moeda é limitada na maioria dos mapas, absolutamente chata e limitada.
---
THIS
---
Who wouldnt?
---
&gt;I enjoyed the saddle collection, but I absolutely despise the way the currency gathering is limited on most of the maps, absolutely boring and limited.
---
It's clearly intentional.
---
A key difference between this and an official ANET trailer is that the latter usually makes the game and game world look duller than it actually is. So well done and kudos for making the game look sexy and epic. It deserves it.
---
Everything will still be here when you return!
---
Except your friends you used to play with.
---
I'd wager the combat is not one of the most important aspects of the MMORPG genre as a whole, socialization and roleplaying are, and that's what most people are about.
---
If your game with shitty combat has a decent prestige system that leads to socialization, then it will be a better MMORPG than a game with great combat but awful reward systems.
---
Sorry to hear that r/guildrecruitment didn't work out for you.
---
Since the megaservers are split between NA and EU it would be helpful to know which one you are on.
---
It would also help to know what kind of content you are into for trying to find people thar share interests with you.
---
I'm fairly certain that you can find a social guild in-game by going to Lions Arch or Divinity's Reach and asking around in mapchat. Usually you will find a few guilds there that are recruiting and I'm certain that you will find one that suits your needs.
---
Keep in mind that you can join 5 guilds at the same time, don't be afraid to use them all in your quest in finding a good fit. 
---
If you are on EU feel free to hit me up in-game on ostjaevel.3247 I'm usually around everyday and I generally do open world, story and fractals but I don't mind doing other things (though I am terrible at PvP).
---
The only one stopping your from doing it is yourself. Pick a class, learn the build at the golem and join training runs or open your own squad.
---
Druid, firebrand, renegade are all solid picks. Firebrand/renegade combos tend to be more favorable in most PvE scenarios, but Druid can still be a top pick
---
After that, tempest is pretty strong (better as a healer but not as useful as an overall support), and scrapper and scourge can be great in the right circumstances (PvP/WvW settings for scrapper, not PvE)
---
why is it the final one?
---
In addition to what everyone else is saying, it doesn't hurt to find and farm a full home instance once a day. It's profitable anyway, and you get currencies from all living story zones.
---
yes! we need more JoJo memes
---
Yeah I'm aware of this. But I figured the overlap between GW2 and Dota 2 probably isn't massive due to the genre difference. Time to ask for a host LUL.
---
&gt; not openly supporting this tournament just because it has a silly name. 
---
That's not the reason. Look at the way the footage was being recording. That is the reason.
---
Oh wow that's really cool; dark, sinister. Nice job. I wish the actual raids  actually had this darker, scarier aesthetic. What's the eye from again? Statues?
---
Ha! Go make Vision and then you’ll see what real pain is
---
Red Bull.
---
Why 227 AR?
---
Well, maybe thats because no-one goes above and beyond like Teapot with his ERP and creates such a hype around it.
---
How does One Wolf Pack actually work? Like, what does it really do in fights?
---
Why do you require all endgame items/mounts when you just play for 30 min/day? Better play whatever is fun in the time you have.
---
OK here the "long run" Tip for NEXT season.
---
1. Buy the Gem-Shop Unlimited tools with the new magic glyph (volatile for last season) as soon as they get released
---
2. Put them on your main to gain enough magic over time
