Rata Novus in HoT, Rata Primus in LS4.  They get little tag on's for story that so far has been "they have/had other cities!" but little else for Asura lore.  I want to see more LORE of the Asura, add their political element and how some leaders seem to have very close ties to enemy factions.  
---

---
Charr and Norn have been so neglected that each deserves their own LS season, and expansion, and a follow up LS season to explore what their lore is.  Charr have more flushed out, since they have the history of GW1 to back things up (probably meaning they're harder to work into new story because of continuity), and Norn have a bare minimum amount of lore allowing for LOTS of story telling to go on (perhaps some LS about how their desire to be written into ballads?)
---
Pfft, Aurene never even slept in the bed we made for her.
---
Chrono is still the meta in raids, the class has gotten significantly easier as well (no more swapping weapons for extra boon duration) and with the release of diviners it gives more room for chronos to provide better boons and damage. Imo till you have a great grasp of chronomancer again run the 100% boon duration build (pretty much full diviners) to give yourself room for error.
---
Didnt you read? They need to fix it by fixing it!
---
This was me doing the Blazeridge collection step, hitting the mark and falling off the other side of the spot.
---
Maybe I was the clone all along?
---
I would second this, but add the caveat that you should take care not to be tank for new encounters or fights you are rusty on. Practice as off tank or in fractals and know your golem rotation well.
---
Apologies, I'm not seeing the connection between any of the banner collections and the Vabbi Leyline Anomaly, could you elaborate on what you mean?
---
Are they stuck or something?  Surprised they're not swarming you.
---
I think you're selling gathering and crafting a little short.  I don't want to farm for gold.  I want to play the video game, and gathering and then crafting things for myself are things I enjoy doing in this video game.
---
&gt;It should feel rewarding to go out of your way to find rare mats or save money by gathering resources for your own personal use
---
It does feel rewarding to do that.  Off-hand, materials worth stopping for are: every metal but copper, every wood but green, both truffles, flax, herb sprouts, peppers, a couple of the berries I think?  I stop for almost everything; all the basic materials can be converted into time gated ascended mats that are consistently valuable.  I've spent years stockpiling those mats, and now if I need some quick cash I just sell a few, or if I feel like making X character Y piece of ascended gear I just do that no worries.  My account isn't flooded with ascended boxes; maybe we're doing different content.
---
Also I've found those account-bound materials incredibly useful.  I have the home instance nodes and it lets me stockpile stacks of the things that can be turned into ascended trinkets or UM/VM whenever I need.  Between those and crafting I've handled all my ascended gear mostly without boxes and it's overall been a very rewarding process that continues to be useful to me.
---
I feel like we're just playing the game differently.  I try to pretend that farming for gold doesn't exist.
---
Yes. It's stupid amounts of worth it.
---
You literally can't lose progress on a JP ever again if you just bother to use it. And it has some other uses too, like finishing the adventure in Thunderhead (the materials that have to be cooled one) in 20 seconds flat without ever using one of the cooling spots.
---
And that's not even half of it.
---
I’ve had so many random uses for it. It’s pretty great in DF when I see some mistborne motes below and I don’t want to climb back up.  Recharges every 30 seconds. Totally worth for stuff like this.
---
You can also use it while falling to return, so great for Not So Secret JP types of situations as well.
---
It does reset in Goemm's Lab though.
---
I think you missed my point . The complaining about the dye channels has been going on since legendary armor launched. Anet will fix it someday . As someone who has 30 legendaries . Including light and heavy legendary armor. Soon to be medium to.The stats change, is the main reason for legendary armor imo. I skin and dye them depending and what I like. There's costumes that cover your armor . I wish you could mix and match costume pieces. I would loved to be able to dye legendaries weapons to match my toons. I prefer options in gaming.
---
Thanks!
---
Take a look.
---
That wasn't always the case. You used to be able to open the chest without defeating the anomaly.
---
Also if someone respawns the anomaly again before you get to the chest you won't be able to open it either and have to kill it again and hope nobody tries to spawn it before you get to the chest again.
---

The Asura don’t require approval from the bookahs.
---
Second one from the left ;)
---
I would say Anet is concerned for us but this is our normal.
---
Nice, I guess I'll be getting it
---
That's a cool way to play and I understand why people enjoy it, but it's not for everyone. A lot of players are all about "getting the most out of their time" and taking the time to gather and craft like that isn't practical for them. There needs to be some tangible benefit for people to go out of their way to gather and craft if it's to be a bigger part of the game.
---
For example, imagine if food that you crafted yourself (or maybe by a guildie) lasted 50% longer? Bam, you now have tons and tons of people harvesting their own mats and making their own meals without making it a required chore. You could compound that with some kind of buff for gathering your own ingredients to extend the duration even further. Craft your own armor/weapons? They no longer take damage.
---
There are tons of little changes that could be made all throughout the game to encourage people do use gathering and crafting without negatively impacting those that don't want to spend the time.
---
Indeed. Should've used free camera :&gt;
---
The story portion of each episode is fairly quick. They can be done in any order but if you want the full story experience then yeah, that is the order to do it in. Unless you're really into story tho I prob wouldn't worry about order as there are things like mounts that you'll want to have to make your life easier that are obtained faster by doing the story out of order.
---
I personally prefer direct-trading with players, but understand why people like auction houses and trading posts. A good middle ground would be to keep the auction house, but allow direct trades to take place at a reduced tax rate (say, 10% instead of 15). So you can still quickly and easily sell your mats, or, if you spend a little bit more time and effort, arrange a direct trade to squeeze out that extra gold.
---
&gt; Wow, that's a shit meme. 
---
&gt; Thanks. 
---
&gt; Thanks.
---
likewise bro
---
That's not how Fractals work. They don't render the entities in them unresponsive: Fractal beings can and *do* react to their surroundings, and can temporarily alter the outcomes of Fractal events before they reset. A Fractal-locked dragon skeptic, when presented with a dragon, will still see a dragon, and react as one might expect to seeing a dragon immediately after saying they don't exist (probably terror or awe).
---
This man, on the other hand, is just an idiot.
---
As stated before: Generally I think this would be a reasonable route for a game to take, but it does not suite gw2 well. 
---
Apart from that there is the possibility to trade directly with a 0% tax - it is just clunky and needs community provided infrastructure such as trusted third parties (to prevent scamming). This does exist in the game. 
---
But I do think the removal of a 1-on1 trading system when compared to the first game was very deliberate (and back then something heavily demanded by big parts of the community). While the idea of profiting from taking your time to find trading partners and trade at better rates might be appealing to you it runs counter to the idea of easy and equal access.
---
Cool, thank you for letting me know! Now I just have to decide what stats to give the gear..!
---
My main is a guardian (Dragonhunter) and I wanted to make a Firebrand set for him... Just don't know if I want to go healer, condi, or quickbrand.
---
Thats was just a nice joke from our lovely anet \^\^
---
Problem is, currently you have to choose between Doppelganger and Pinata. If they shortened the wait time for Doppelganger to spawn (20 minutes after Josso dies) it would sort the issue out for those people.
---
Glyph of the Tailor is nice for that.
---
Which was my point. Were i can see this being a issue, other players or those doing riots on reddit seem to not see at all and there for have very little patience or understanding that they can not always get showerd with loot to be happy. Not understanding that sure you can get everything you want but then everything is worth nothing and the echonomy colapps.

You have good friends to do this for you.

Gw2hook with some custom effects. I guess I could be able to share the config by just uploading the whole gw2hook folder.
---
Quickbrand can be effective with just Berserker gear, so I wouldn't really recommend Diviner's armour.  If Berserker winds up not being enough, just swapping on Diviner trinkets should help and keeping the Berserker armour I presume your Dragonhunter already has.  So that should help narrow the choice down to Harrier for healing or Viper/Grieving for Condi.
---
Really hope the infinite mistlock passkey is up for sale again soon. I got a 2 week one from a bundle and became pretty hooked on the convenience. The inability to go back to your previous location with the PoF one makes it pretty crap in comparison, plus the mistlock lighting is so nice for showing off your character.
---
I suppose there are, but more so I was trying to link the arrow keys use for basic games and how that control scheme evolved into WASD bc it allowed for more QoL in 3 dimensions with the mouse.
---
And you should learn when to stop harassing other members. Take this as an official warning, if all you're going to do is throw insults then leave the post and move on.
---
You already know dungeons. They haven't changed in terms of mechanics except the liquid rewards have been curbed down to fit its difficulty.
---
Fractals are no longer randomized as a set of three. The random factors are instabilities: a set of annoying conditions that prevent players to trivia the fights. Daily fractals are introduced and give a significant reward/income. Fractals have two Challenge Motes at level 99/100. That's where the endgame for 5-man group content is.
---
Raids expand the boundary of group size to 10 men. Raid encounters are generally longer in comparison though enrage timer is capped at 10 minutes or less. Enrage timer isn't too severe, it allows players to get used to the mechanics more or less. Due to the 10 man comp, team can get creative with their comp and role assignment. Experienced group with decently high DPS can even succeed in skipping certain (hassle) mechanics for a smoother experience or better kill time. However the generally required DPS is low enough to accommodate "training" groups. Training raids often started with low to no DPS-check bosses which also require the least personal responsibility from each player, and so a few experienced player can lead or teach the group by filling in a few key roles. On the other end of the spectrum, there are bosses that requires team split 2 or 3 ways to cover every mechanics on point and with more damage pressure or dps check. There are also challenge motes that gives prestigious titles. People are most interested in raids for their legendary armor and ring, but the weekly rewards also give decent gold.
---
that would be so nice  :D

Looks like you want a very different game than many of us do. Maybe mmos aren't for you then. Economy IS a big aspect and should matter.

Give it time, we already have the stupid ass neon color hair

... So accurate it hurts....
---
Devs have released balance patches half way through pvp seasons before. I wouldn’t hold my breath.
---
It's not just precursors, you lose money by crafting most things. With the current crafting system, there is no cost to crafting except a bit of time and clicks. If an item sells for more on the TP than its craft cost, any player can quickly produce as much as they want and arbitrage the gap away. So crafting prices will represent an upper bound rather than a lower bound.
---
The exceptions are time gated crafts, where you can actually still make money by crafting.
---
To make crafting worthwhile as you want, it has to actually cost something. That could be more daily caps on crafting certain items, or it could be a certain number of "crafting points" you get per day.
---
To add: I tweaked it for high post processing setting, if you turn it off it will look quite different (for better or worse)
---
They were already nerfed hard last patch. Stop hitting the clones
---
Np. Don't mind the error messages it gives at startup, nothing seems broken.
---
Also, you can delete the effects that are not used so it doesnt always scan through the 50+ of them
---
Yeah I only use the PoF one to save a bit on WPing to that area from far away, everything else is Mistlock
---
It used to be Dragon Hunter
---
You reminded me how I used to have alts parked at rich plat/iron. Or trip over truffle nodes. Hell, I even had my personal farming routes around the maps. Now even going for mussels and jungle plants feels questionable.
---
A lot of open world players use defensive gear all the while scaling me. He also doesn’t scale for fewer players.
---
Better get on a condi class to kill it
---
I think Tac0 by Tekkit has one.
---
Right now materials are going to be at their lowest with the new loot box from the meta event rush.  Iron dropped from 2s down to 1.5s even..
---
Applies ￼ Teleport Recharging (1h) to the character that used it. This effect only counts down while playing that character.
---
It seems like absolute waste of gems to me personally. Won't ever buy it, unless they make realtime cooldown.
---
got it ^^
---
but im shit
---
Well certain stats/runes/sigils combos will make life easier, when you go without those enchantments  but those things can all be gathered with exotic gear ofc
---
got it and love it! its worth it!
---
That final instance was purely symbolic. I had to afk at some point and downed, but Aurene proceeded to ress me and then solo the boss because she can't die.

As a new player crafting my ascended set all I can say is: GOOD.  You already need to farm like madman or make Gajilion of gold to buy enough mats, they really don't need to be more contested.
---
You make a lot of good points, but...
---
&gt;Why craft anything for your alt when you can just whip a dozen ascended boxes out of your bank and instantly gear them to cap 
---
Surely you must realize this is not the case for the \*vast majority\* of players? I only got to this point at around, I dunno, 4k hours played? And honestly at this point I'm glad I don't have to craft that stuff. I need those materials for legendary shit.
---
lol if u want betta crafting go play minecraft or something
---
The reasoning is quite simple.  No economist (that we know of) and there is nothing for veteran players to spend large amounts of gold on.  Legendary weapons are all out.  Most of them have what they want minus things like infusions.  The supply just keeps going up and up while the demand for materials continues to drop.  The only days you really see any movement on the market anymore is on patch day (and the days around it really).
---
It's mainly like this because that badge gets replaced by you mastery level as soon as you earn you first point. It is likely that they believe that showing your mastery level for others to see is a better way to show off your progress in the game instead of map completion, both because its account wide and because they can easily increase the number by adding more masteries.
---
There's also the issue that, as they've elaborated on in the past, their world completion system is really badly coded. The reason why the world completion info that shows when you open the map doesn't contain any expac maps is because the thing is so badly set up that messing with it can screw up a lot of things.
---
Why are you so triggered? I'm a casual and just by doing two Dragonball metas I got like 80+ yellows to scrap for ectos. I didn't even rush through the metas, just went wherever the commander went. Istan is pretty nice too, when there's people there.

Thanks for the kind words! Let me know if you have any suggestions or want more details on anything. It's still very much a work in progress that I'm constantly looking to improve.
---
The problem is as time goes on, less players will have access to it. For this it seems okay because it's the same season, but going forward, there should be some central always-accessible location. Like waht good ol' home instances should have been.
---
 That's good to know! I've been slowly farming up some of S2's currencies so getting the trinkets won't bee too hard. I guess I'll have to decide now is if I want to go for condi or healing! :D
---
You, sir are a GENIUS!

Please show me your programming portfolio then.
---
Yeah I’m waiting for it several month now, I bought the 2 weeks pass for the 3rd time and it closed yesterday. Feelsbadman staying in LA and have to actually walk to vendors and so on...
---
Awesome post to stimulate some discussion.
---
I think some of us disagree with you and that’s okay. I personally don’t want to run around gathering and mining. I don’t want it to be meaningful. It represents an outdated concept from previous generation MMORPGs that is so tedious and boring especially after awhile and trying a few of them. To me, it is as if someone wants turn based combat. 
---
I really enjoy where we are now where we actually play and do events fighting and socializing instead of following taco markers farming elder wood and flax like a zombie. That is what runescape is for (no shade). I like that it’s still there and when it’s on my way I still gather knowing it will cover some teleportation cost.
---
I’m not as experienced as you are in TP economy. But does the crash in material benefit regular people that don’t depend on trading? Doesn’t it make it cheaper for everyone to buy things and enjoy the game? Need some professional to chime in here.
---
Wish i had the time to get Exordium as oi love its animations. One day...
---
Phasing already exists. You see it in Crystal Oasis after you chose a side (Joko, Sunspears or neutral).
---
Anet just doesn't do it because they don't think it's worth the effort to update old maps.
---
Well a magic flaming sword saves you expenses for matches or a lighter. I am not sure about the smoking/BBQing/romantic candlelight dinner habits of Charr but I'm sure you'll save a lot of gold that way.
---
Yes! I think everyone who is a decent player should give raiding a try. I was so afraid for years and when I finally tried with those kind helpers I regret not starting sooner. It is very time consuming and may not suit everyone’s lifestyle. I think often training runs demand 2 hours non stop. 
---
So to make full use of it I just read some guides and try to understand my class better and slowly analyzing why snowcrow have those builds. I tell my friend the best way is do T4 fractals seriously and perfectly, anticipating every attack and dodging everything and challenge yourself to not down. I think many people just lazily dps, never bothered to learn each mechanics fully, and going down knowing someone will resurrect anyways. That can have more serious consequences in raids. 
---
But on that note! Trainers are so friendly and will never blame you and stay positive so never let mistakes be a deterrent to try raiding. I think just be self aware and If you see you are completely useless and just can’t keep up with the group it is better to politely drop out and either practice more or try other game modes. I was not ready for some harder bosses and went to practice my rotation more instead of wasting other nine people’s times who were more prepared than me. When I was ready again it was much more fun.
---
Its quite true that that stone do need some other use since Anet actually sells it in gem store.. and silver-o-matic also removes consumtion of mystic forge stone. For profitability-wise having some additional use would make sense.
---
why i am not surprised to read that namw in that context 😂
---
Only Stavemaster is a Nightmare Courtier, and the southern lane has no notable relation to NC, and the Commander is Axemaster Hareth who has no known lore - instead they have chak, nuhoch, and Rata Novus. In other words, they're TD focused.
---
Similarly, northern lane (Stavemaster Arywn) has Exalted and skritt, making it AB related.
---
And lastly, central lane is VB focused with wyverns, Pact, and Itzel. That commander is Blademaster Diarmid, who appears in VB.
---
Originally, the three commanders were meant to show up in each zone, not just Diarmid, but were scrapped (they were also meant to show up in the story a few times, while only Arywn shows up and in an optional path too). I'd imagine based off of this, Arywn would have been in AB, and Hareth in TD.
---
This set up, of course, reduces the chance of a fourth lane, since that would suggest a fifth zone for HoT (but hey, maybe originally there were five zones planned, and such was canceled very early on, after work had begun on the fourth lane in DS).
---
[some you act like you wouldn't buy these boots in the gem store if they were available seperately.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/thumb/1/14/Raiment_of_the_Lich.jpg/559px-Raiment_of_the_Lich.jpg)]

I just remember a few of the collections had more tedious things to do. I probably misremember though.
---
So from the back and forth in the comments, it seems that you want to change the time of the event so you grab them all.
---
It's basically luck whether you get people upvoting or downvoting. Sometimes some meme goes to the front page, some times a piece of discussion is downvoted for going against the grain.
---
But also because the topic doesn't really invoke a whole lot of discussion I guess.
---
Looks Branded. Which suggests either he transforms *again* (there's a lot of branded in the raid - even rifts with Kralk looking through, oddly enough!) or that the Mythwright Cauldron gave him a dragon minion appearance... Which implies the raid may give insight on the nature of dragon corruption and/or the dragon domains of magic.
---
Ill comeback and play when your done fucking over thief. Until then ill be afking with my music box in DR.

I think there's a bot that automatically downvotes everything in this sub. Even patch notes get dropped to 0 in the first couple minutes.

Looks like he's using generic djinn animation in that bit, which have smaller hands. Normal djinn wouldn't clip doing that bit.

Dyable auras for legendary trinkets when Anet!?

Condition power, healing power, expertise, and concentration would be my dream setup for Scourge.

spvp is 5v5 with normalized gear and stats. level doesn't matter. wvw is rvrvr. basically world pvp that takes level and pve gear into account. combat in this game is like no other with how fluid it is. ive never played eso pvp but i heard that wvw is similar to how their large scale pvp functions

Poor, both PvP modes are stale and neglected.

&gt; Hello, I am a chrono main who raided a lot in Spirit Vale and like a week into the release of Bastion of the Penitent (I didn't even clear Deimos). My computer could barely run the game any more and wasn't displaying some mechanics during Deimos so I only logged in occasionally for the story updates and pof until I recently got a new pc.
---
**Welcome back!**
---
&gt; I am working towards regearing following the Snow Crows website and getting familiar with the rotation. Should I wait until done regearing before joining training groups ? I'd like to get back into shape but don't want to do it if my gear isn't good. I have a berserker set (with commander pants) with leadership runes, a minstrel set with durability runes and a commander set with firebrand runes. Is any of that useable ?
---
**As long as you are able to keep Quickness and Alacrity going for your subgroup there won't be a problem. If you're running any kind of minstrel piece though, *always* check up toughness with the other Chrono, since the new meta is using the lowest possible toughness in most bosses.**
---
&gt; How is playing chrono nowadays ? Is it still fun and rewarding but thankless and impossible to swap out of ? 
---
**I wouldn't really call it "rewarding", but yes, it's still fun and impossible to get out. Chronojail for life.**
---
 
---
&gt; Has it gotten any easier/harder ? 
---
**It's pretty much the same. Just need to learn new rotations every so often.**
---
&gt; How demanding on the chrono are Hall of chain and Mythwright Gambit ?
---
**Chrono still gets the shittiest jobs to do, and most of the responsability. Tanking and special roles. Same old, same old.**

No.

I guess a chrono would go with diviner armor and berserker weapons?
---
Ohhhh that's handy! It took me 10 days out of my 14day pass to realise I just had to change layers on the map to map out, I thought it was a bit shit having to port to LA or whatever and then map out.
---
I am also checking for the perma pass almost daily, it's was Jan 21st that it was last in the store :(
---
I mean imagine not knowing which character is actually yours and camera centers around the whole group and not on one specific instance of those clones. And they all repeat same stuff
---
I don’t have PoF yet lol
---
You can already mix berserker with zealot or harrier for power/off heal build.
---
I would say Dragonfall Meta + Champion run
---
Also, don't start with the new wing. An experienced group more likely carries newcomers through content they are familar with, but not the new content.
---
If you are able to get raid ready until next week I would recommend you to do so as w7 will then be released. You won't have the disadvantage that you don't know the fight as chrono since it's new and nobody knows it either.
---
Condi Dmg, Healing Power as major
---
Expertise, Concentration as minor
---
Well...not to rangers.
---
Not gonna happen in this game and this timeline. Somehow people still think thief is too powerful when you had to put much more effort in any given fight than your opponent for years already.

---
Yes prices will be lower. Also means that you make less money because nothing is worth anything
---
Wait, maybe i'm just an idiot but how do you have more then 3 clones out? Is there some trait that lets them stay out a bit longer after you burst them?
---
You have a few types of PvP. Structured PvP (sPvP) and world vs World vs World (or WvW in short).

WvW is a battleground system in which your world fights against 2 other worlds over 4 maps over objectives like camps, towers and keeps with Siege weaponry. Those fights can go from 1v1 to XvX in which a lot of players is led by a commander in a squad (that can hold 50 players) clash against each other. WvW has the PvE combat rules, your gear that you have equipped and the traits and skills you have unlocked matter. You will be max level like everyone else but you will be weaker if you are not max level natively because you might be missing the strongest gear or certain skills and traits.
---
sPvP is different. In general you have matches of 5v5 but there are also arenas that have 2v2. Joining those matches depends on what you want to play.
---
Hot Join: You can drop in and out of matches whenever you like and is usually only used to get a feel for how things work, daily farm, duels or just testing stuff out. This is not something you should take seriously!
---
Unranked: here it gets organized, you queue for a match and wait until 9 other players have been found and the match starts and runs until someone wins.
---
Ranked: This is like unranked in the way how you play it, you queue, you find other players and fight until someone wins. The difference is that in Ranked there is something like League Seasons going on for a couple of months and then with a break in between. In that league season you will earn or lose rank points depending if you win or lose and can climb or fall down the leader-board. You will also only be able to earn pips in that league season to earn chests, gold and other currencies that you can trade in for minipets and even legendary precursor PvP armour. You will only be able to queue with a pre-organized group of 2 players in a group.
---
Tournament: This is a tournament type mode. You need a 5 player organized team that is playing at different times for qualification tokens and you will play against other organized teams.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:How_to_Gear_a_Character this is about the only up to date gear guide.
---
GW2 has a gear grind, but it's less grindy than WoW as you can skip a lot of the randomness.
---
You want exotics (good enough) then ascended gear (top-tier) at 80. 
---
You also want to have the right stat combination for your character, which is known as the prefix (berserkers, vipers, diviners etc). Each prefix has different stats attached to it, and how you get them differs. Which one you want depends on your build and what you do.
---
For exotics, Berserker's gear you can just go and buy at the end of a meta event (in Orr), but Viper's has to be crafted using recipes from a different (and worth doing) event chain. You also get a few gear drops as rewards, and you might just get lucky with a random drop.
---
You'll also want a set of 6 matching runes, which give you a large bonus. Most of these can be bought straight from the trading post, but some are linked to specific dungeons. 
---
Fractals and raids drop higher-tier gear and you can use fractal/raid currency to purchase stat-selectable gear. Dungeons are generally just run for fun or for skins, or for certain achievements. GW2 fractals are more like WoW dungeons than GW2 dungeons, which are tied to the story. They're good fun, though and worth doing while levelling as you get a whole level for completing one.
---
&gt; My only counter to this is there is no precedent of anet increasing in-game market value of gemstore items.
---
Trading Post Expresses, a Gemstore item, were made a requirement for Guild Hall upgrades.
---
Tanking SH is actually pretty cool though.
---
For timing, it is mainly when to do burst DPS, if your profession allows it, and little more. Boon uptime is generally expected to be 100%, same with having enough conditions on the boss. There are some encounter specific mechanics where timing is important though, such as Conjured Amalgamate.
---
I'm not a PvP player, but I would play PvP if there would me more game types than one. I hate this type of pvp match where you have to care about some points on the map.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What about a team vs team where there is no respawn after death, and the only thing you have to do is kill enemy team? 3 rounds.
---
Deathmatch - last one standing wins.
---
Any ideas?
---
Revelation time!
---
I dont pvp much, but if there is a mode like hutball from swtor, i would dip my toe in pvp a lot more.
---
This is tehnically masturbating, right? Your just having sex with yourself so nothing strange here
---
That's quality memeing!
---
Never knew I wanted a fern hawk… now I know.
---
I prefer the real buster sword. Needs more girth.
---
Nice try buddy!
---
If you've done one of the metas yes. If not no why should you get the reward if you didn't do the content.
---
Hmmm. Also zero evidence, but seeing as the "fourth lane" is mostly accessible via the northern lane, perhaps it was merely an extension of North? South has a fairly sizable amount of Chak warrens and Asuran architecture off the trail from the ley line path -- maybe North lane had a similar thing happening with the Nightmare Court (culminating in them helping to put down the Stavemaster) but the idea got too big for development so they plopped down some golden walls and called it a day?
---
yoooo…. this thing permanant? Or have to buy multiple?
---
He didn't pay Naru, he paid Zeromi and Helio.
---
i was talking about your suggestions, not the current combos
---
a what now?
---
Well there is but maybe allowing for mods will be better than making it a paid option... Feel like community driven game modes will make more prospect hahahah!
---
With proper sinks you can shower the player and have a healthy economy
---
I am guessing you are only playing open world content then? Because blasting fire for might and water for healing is incredibly useful in WvW. 
---
Would assume that it would be quite useful in raids as well.
---
Stronghold is just a mess honestly. It doesnt show it clearly for beginners where things are, and you end up feeling like there is no impact in what you do... Plus people tend to snowball in that mode...
---
Whats up with this though? im not in the game for very long but it seems like the devs dont have a dedicated team for this....
---
i thought that was just the game in general hahahaha
---
sounds cool hahaha
---
Only classes that can utilize combos well are engi and ele so if you're not playing them then combos are essentially worthless for you. Special mentions for thief in pvp modes, but even then it uses just one field.
---
why would economy be important to an mmo?
---
It's something that happens.  I've crafted only 7 of the many full ascended sets I have now.  However, the argument kind of falls apart as I still had to craft or buy the insignias and inscriptions to stat change all those sets to the stats I wanted even by virtue of playing fractals and raids semi-regularly.  And it's generally cheaper to craft if you have the materials.
---
Really because looking at the BL skins in which we have had a uprise of getting them in numerous of ways and not just for the tickets and most of them are very low, except for the few that flippers keeping high. How are we gonna get a healthy economy with that?
---
Now is the perfect time to read your traits and skills instead of copying :D
---
Most games that have high entry to being an endgame crafter didn’t quite work like this when it comes to the market and many didn’t need daily cooldowns or something like that, of course, in these games crafters are usually supplied by combat oriented players which creates a dynamic because people who are really engaged into crafting not rarely are playing the game for the combat or adventures, it’s a similar reason to the people who play gw2 to make money on the TP without really playing the game itself, the economy didn’t collapse just because they exist as they need people farming the things they are working with to make their money. It’s also cool conceptually as it doesn’t reduce the game to the mere power fantasy and gives players other avenues to “live” and engage with the world.
---
The main reasons I saw in-game economies really collapse in MMO are: massive inflation from the lack of money sinks or money generating exploits being abused, lack of supply because of player number decline or bad recipe balancing, everything worthwhile owning not being tradeable (why bother with money when everything that’s good can’t be traded?) Never saw these as a direct consequence of having limited crafters or not.
---
Not sure how high heels are more impractical than the state of the greatsword skins. Like, you can swing a weapon that would weigh 250kg no problem but you can't run around in heels?
---
Right now 1000 gems is like 300(ish) gold. At 5 silver saved per teleport--which is a super high estimate, most times its like 1.3--it would take you 6000 teleports to break even. At a more conservative estimate of 2 silver per teleport, it would take you 15000 teleports. Now, Ive been playing a lot, but I imagine I dont have 15k teleports under my belt, and that is going to any WP at any time, world boss is only like 10 or so per day. But lets say you somehow do 15 bosses per day. If you assume 5 silver per teleport, it would take you 400 days of using it to break even; if you assume 2 silver per teleport, it would take you 1000 days of using it to break even. (This all assumes no inflation, but come august sales, gems will be worth much more than 300g/1000gems.)
---
Most gem store items are not really for money saving/making, they are just super luxury items that can improve QoL of your account.
---
They do something.
---
You shoot arrows through a fire field and you apply burning. You blast a water field and you gain AoE heal. You blast a fire field and you get might.
---
I think the problem is more that most of those combos are obsolete because they are not needed anymore because many professions can apply buffs natively to the group they are in and healing specs have a sustain of heal that a healing blast probably won't reach.
---
Combo fields are also very prone to mistakes because you might need a heal blast but then someone puts a different field on top of it and then your heal field will not be blasted.
---
When you look at dungeon speed clears before the nerf and basically all instanced content before HoT you had players stack and blast fields to get might.
---
You won't fix the combofields by making them do something else than they were really intended to be. Personally, I think the professions should lose something of their ability to be the source of all boons. I mean, It was unthinkable of a necro to have a full stack of Might and yet I can comfortably can keep it up with a reaper.
---
I would want to see the return of combo fields in fractals and such.
---
I’ll be sincere, as someone who had an Alchemist dedicated to crafting back in the old glory days of RO, worked hard to be own a bunch of rare recipes in WoW hwile I played it, spent a little over two months leveling my crafters in FFXIV, and really enjoying leveling my first crafter in this game when I started playing, without using a guide, yes, there are people who enjoy crafting and braindead farming and engaging with the markets.
---
It’s just another style of playing that is pretty much exclusive to MMOs, as it really is pointless in single player games with a final goal.
---
There is plenty of website where you can see a ton of these. Be sure to be +18.
---
the main problem with combo's is field priorities (or whatever ppl call them) making them very unreliable in group content but otherwise they're mostly fine as they currently are. 
---
and having fields combine with eachother would only worsen that problem (unless they don't affect finishers in wich case what'd be the point?)
---
This is quality content!!!
---
Rework of the current combo fields is rather unlikely to happen, I think but they could introduced something a'la Aion skill chains - if you would met requirements (standing in right combo field) you could launch another button (like special action key) for new additional effects. They could pack this as mastery feature - if of course it would be possible to create it
---
Few tips for raiding :
---
\- Play broken free slots class, like chrono, druid, warrior. You'll have a spot on most pu groups.
---
\- Learn basic rotations on golem, for these class you don't need to train for hours, they are very easy for great results.
---
\- Find a way to fake LI's, you can google that.
---
You can "leech" pretty much any boss right now, when I'm raiding I just take my druid with some random gears/no runes/no trinketsand it works.
---
Sparklecharr? Disgrace to the Legions.
---
Cooking mats (most of them anyway) also desperately need a sink. It's sad. But i for now got my way around this issue, to protect my income in guild wars 2. So for me it's not problem. But for lot of people it is.
---
Is that like mesmer portal? Cause that one is kinda annoying with the 60s cooldown and all, also seems you can use this gadget mid-air so it's a lot better.
---
Maybe the olmakhlan will accept me uwu
---
SC build doesn't have a boon duration capped, IIRC, because if you're really good with your rotations, you pull out enough boons anyway, but since you're probably not Fennec, I advise to cap it. In my experience, no pug  group will bother about chrono damage anyway and having a good boon uptime is much more beneficial than 2-3k of personal dps increase.
---
Actually this new stone is exactly same as the old one, this one just has those new weapon skins in loot table. For precursors, it behaves exactly same.
---
Cool I'm the rare 0.02%
---
Looking at this, I dont want Qadim to just have a Raid story or Better yet i want Qadim to have followers in living story #lazarus2.0
---
I want negative stats!
---
Power, Ferocity +++
---
Vitality, toughness -
---
gotta live that squishy ele dream
---
Why f over classes with no good combo fields further?
---
If you want note than 150 burning DMG, maybe use condition damage?
---
Cool, hope you like how it looks :)
---
It is like the back bone in all game modes. I think you need to read up on what they are doing and what the effect that happens leads too. Like if you read that you gain frost aura, retaliation, blindness and so on well sounds good but what does that really mean to you. With that knowledge it can save your life more often then not and also raise your dps to kill faster.
---
In WvW, in all kind of WvW, zergs, raids, small group play combo fields are used all the time. Same with sPvP and instanced PvE.
---
I guess in Pve open world players don't get in touch that much with it and not knowing makes players miss out on something that helps them and make them better. They also miss out on all the times others have saved their life by using a combofield for them so that they would not die by reflecting, blinding, blasting a water field or cleansed them without their knowledge. If they had it they could have saved their own life and others.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Combo Just read and follow up what each field do and how you can use it.
---
Happen to have any footage? That sounds hilarious
---
That was not your explanation on how. So what is your how?
---
I do agree there were some moments in there which were okay. I personally did not much like the scarlet storyline - I thought it was painful - but yes, the ending was okay. The living story has gotten so much better in every way since then though, so I don’t find it too tragic that things have turned out the way they have.
---
It is already a thing today no? Just now with the new legendary trinket you have to craft 4 weapons which require materials and the cry out on reddit have already been there for 4 simple weapons were you have to unlock 4 recipes. It was close to the end of the world according to many here.
---
Druid do healing combos very often. Staff 3 in Staff 5 or Warhorn 5 in Healing Spring.
---
thank you! hope you're right and I can get closer to plat next season :)
---
Tell me about it, as a result I don't do many core Tyria jumping puzzles anymore because I am too used to having gliding and mounts. I know a lot of them disable either mounts or gliding or both but I am too used to it now to judge my regular jumps correctly or keep an eye on when those effects are active (SAB being the only exception, because I have played it way more than I care to admit).

This is a Starter map, you see no green arrow here
---
I hope some big changes with it will come, afking and trolling in the matches make everything so unpleasant, so anti GW2 values. Reporting is just getting out of hand, hate if someone can't play the best and just learns to play is really sad. I loved the times when Ranked could actually be played in 5 man party with friends. I had a PvP guild and we were 5 and more players that teamed up for our goals and we understood each other gameplay so well, when the update with reducing party size to 2, it killed my PvP guild. I don't know if players asked for this change or what, but in my opinion that's the reason why PvP turned so full of toxicity, the games are so rigged, depends on luck only, if you get good pugs you win, if you don't, then no. You have no control over your rank or going for the titles, going for being really on top of the list. It's all rigged.
---
I have no idea what ascended trinkets are and if I want them :D 
---
So I will not miss out anything major if I play HoT directly after the core game? Just some quests and story that kind of bridges the gaps or its a totally  separate thing? 
---
Is playing HoT and PoF first before past living world seasons normal? And then if you still enjoy Guild Wars 2 and stick around, you play the seasons?
---
I usually think of Mythbusters there:
---
*Jamie wants big boom*
---
These poor men didn't yet realize that the Skyscale is not a Griffon replacement, substitute or downgrade, but rather a complete new entity with its own unique use case.
---
Don't forget to do the repeatable hero points. They give like 35k exp and are easy.
---
Well then... I know what I'm going to buy later today.
---
Most classes have kinda predefined roles. If you don't want to play that role, play another class.
---
Yeah, don't listen to reddit. But just one legendary ain't gonna cut it
---
Then again, sometimes it feels impossible to get the teamspeak password for my own server
---
probably the guy that fucked the scout's mom
---
with the exception crystal guardian isnt in unid gear loottable
---
Diviner is great for open world builds that can self provide boons like quickness. I'd love to see one for condi (condi dmg and concentration main, precision and expertice 2nd). 
---
There is also the possibilitt of a pure condi statset with condi dmg main and precision &amp; expertice 2nd.
---
i 'd get it for my alt account and avoid spending 250 gold for the gripphon still i have no idea if it 's possibile to reach all the eggs without glider and gripphon will be fun to discover once i'll finish with main
---
That's pretty nice, progging is my favourite part of raiding. I originally wanted to take my time and craft a new set but if it releases next week I might just swap stats. As much as it pains me to get rid of the runes of leadership after that awful dragon stand grind.
---
Bounties sound like the worst way to do it.
---
Pop a booster. Do dragonfly or do adventures like supply runs or griffon courses.
---
the "gear grind" in gw2 is to have every class with every elite spec unlocked and different sets of gear (power dps, condi dps, support [boons, healing, etc], maybe tanking) to fullfill different roles in different parts of the game (high tier fractals, raids, solo open world builds, wvw zerging and roaming).
---
for that you will need the specific armors (with special runes), weapons (with special sigils), trinkets and backpacks. for high tier fractals you will also need infusion.
---
all that will take you some time to finish.
---
thats gw2's "gear grind".
---
The thing is that you still have to have some central objective, so one team just don't hide in permastealth and wait for your lose of interest, ganking you then. 2vs2 arena had it probably quite right, as there was not too much space, and the playable area went smaller later on, so people had to fight in middle.
---
People get stomped because they are new, not because they don't have certain elite specialization. There are core builds that are straight meta, and there is a lot of useful core builds as well. But if you don't have dodging under your skin yet, no build can help you.
---
Any classes that don't do well in raids?
---
this is what they did with 2v2 tournaments and it was hyped. i dont know why they deleted the 2v2 ATs and 2v2 mAT again. someone knows ?
---
I heard some rumours that now you need to have full progress, that you can't loot the chest if you come from the end side...
---
Yeah TVs are not the basis of the entire economy, ectos are. People don't get paid in TVs the way that people who play the game get "
---
"paid" in ectos. Terrible comparison.
---
You dont have to get rid of them. Iirc they use them primarily for fury since sc plays 1 druid and ofc the dps increase. But for pugs with 2 healers its perfectly fine to use them.
---
i hope more people will play for this season so we have a bigger playerbase and not every sigle day and match the same mates or enemys.
---
I did that for over 1000 hours and that resulted in 1 box from tequatl.
---
Go back to L2, please.
---
I mean... if you have excess mithril you need to get rid of... let's just say I know a place ;)
---
It depends on what you want to do. In general, there are fewer options for good support and condition damage builds as opposed to power damage.
---
For providing quickness and alacrity then chronomancer, firebrand and renegade can work. Only chronomancer can do both so firebrand and renegade are reliant on each other or a chronomancer.
---
For main might generation over 10 people Druid is the best option but Tempest is viable for this too. Other alternatives such as Deadeye and Mirage aren't.
---
For secondary healers / boons then Druid, Scrapper, Renegade, Herald, Tempest, Scourge and Firebrand are all good. 
---
For power DPS the current strongest options are arguably Dragonhunter (burst), Weaver, Chronomancer and Daredevil. Deadeye, Herald, Reaper, Holosmith and Soulbeast are (generally) less useful, unless the Soulbeast is also bringing spirits.
---
Condition damage is less equitable. Renegade and Mirage are generally much stronger than the other alternatives.
---
This is a very general overview and doesn't take into account niche roles like hand or Qadim kiting or niche builds like boon thief.
---
This gadget is functionally very similar to Spectral Walk. Neither can be used initially midair (both *used* to be able to, but have since been patched), but both can activate the recall while falling.
---
That said, the gadget is much, much better. Since the mark position and return skills are two different slots, rather than a flip skill like Spectral Walk, you can immediately mark a new location every time you progress, and if you do fall you can immediately re-mark your position and try again without waiting unless you fall a second time within 30s. SW, on the other hand, only marks one location between cooldown, so if you fall you return to the earliest location you activated your safety net. Also, if you do use the recall on SW, you have to wait for the full cooldown before you can move with safety again.
---
Well that was my point ;P
---
I wrote the first post saying that Arena Net sit in a damned if you do and damned if you don't position that is not so easy to handle because players in this game are so entitled to everything. I never seen it in such a way as i do in GW2 and it always baffled me. 
---
Either way that is what i meant with hard to ballance this two. Echonomy have to work for the better or the good or it will collaps. And players have to be on some sort of level were they understand that and also understand that it means they can not be entitled to everything. Some were there have to some space for Arena Net to manage both without reddit exploding or the echonomy collapsing.
---
It's indeed Spectral Walk. The gadget has a number of features that make it better than SW, even on a Necro, and of course being able to use it on other classes is a plus.
---
Like, its understandable that a durability system would be a factor for a heavy material-based economy like GW2, but its not a good one in the long term. Putting aside all the minor details for now, the main problems would be how durability is lost, and as you mentioned that repairing lowers your durability we're dealing with fixed numbers and not % based ones mmos like FF14 use, so problems arise there, for example, does gear quality affect durability damage. The answer for that would naturally be yes since you'd expect to take less part damage from gear of a lower tier while dishing out more towards it. The problem with that is Legendary gear all over again. In terms of stats its equal to Ascended and thus a tier higher than exotics, but in reality its 2 tiers higher so it'd be taking less damage and dishing more towards exotics as far as durability is concerned. The next factor is condition damage, realistically speaking Burning would be dealing small chip damage to durability each time you'd take HP damage, but even then they can just kill you through bleeds, poison, torment, confusion etc and then you'd have the hit to durability from the death penalty.
---
Players who are much, much poorer in the game would pretty much be alienated from the game as people are buying up and hoarding mats for themselves or resale, forget ascended even exotics would be hard to come by. HoT mobs hit like a truck even now if you're not careful, now you've got people running around in mix and match masterwork or rares that they got from loot or karma vendors, stats all over the place desperately trying to get Bladed armor and trying to save the several hundred gold needed for exotic weapons now that TP sharks are making fat profits.
---
For better or for worse a durability system using GW2's combat mechanics would hurt the playerbase more than help the economy.
---
I am sorry i lost the logic in this post but since you going to refer to magic there is nothing to talk about anyway so i just say ok.....
---
Taht's what i thought too, but i read online that damage infusions add only like 5%
---
i had 9k damage and it should be 27k so that's a lot more than taht. :/
---
Assuming you're using all +5 power infusions, you're looking at a ~1% dps increase. This is not what you're missing to justify 23k dps.
---
&gt; healer [...] had more damage than me.
---
&gt;We cleared the fractal without Problems
---
You mean you got carried.
---
I remember when I used to park 30 chars at southsun cove on the ori node and hit that 3 times a day just for $. It wasn't exactly the most engaging content but heck if i didn't have fun watching my wealth grow in game over time through Ori/sprockets lol.
---
The node runs were also great for quick cash, iron/plat rich nodes on multi chars etc. 
---
Nowadays nothing feels rewarding; i can make more money sitting at the TP for 10 mins doing some basic common sense cyclical investments (rice balls, quartz, wday gifts etc every year) then i can playing the game and that's just depressing man.
---
Oh fuck me.
---
because ppl precast stuff in actual scenarios? maybe not in raids but on some fractal encounters you can double cast a lot, weapon swap etc.
---
for example with mistlock thingie you can double cast lich form minions and then make all(most) 16 of them explode while in shroud when enemy is exposed, doing practically same burst as dgh/slb https://dps.report/3Cyr-20190606-163804_siax
---
* I'd like to say other style maps, but that hasn't worked out well. The game would have to be heavily balanced for them.
---
* End of season reward chest (maybe a chance at an ascended piece?)
---
* More frequent and meaningful balance
---
* Reduce visual clutter
---
* Additional way to make a comeback in a game? idk, there are a lot of people who give up
---
If it's a casual group flaming people post clear is a dick move and comes from a position of elitism. A lot of people use arc to improve their own numbers and I wouldn't say simply using it makes you an elitist
---
Enjoy o/
---
you can only have 18 active infusion slots at a time, meaning at best you're gonna get +90 stats out of them. that's not gonna significantly help either of you.
---
Maybe it's also an client side visual bug. Dunno why but TD gathers people doing various graphical glitches. Very often after TD I see few players that have a series of clones of themselves standing in line (and that are never mesmers). Once whispered for answers I get either a silence or "it's a secret". I also saw some brief effects of this combined aurora with black orb on non mesmers as well.
---
I don't think so, i broght a lot to the party, boons and loads of cc. even when the other dude claimed my damage was low.
---
But since you react to me like an elitist you are certainly entitled to that opinion
---
I am not elitist if I expect a dps player to do more dps than a healer.
---
But using it to flame is not only elitism but also toxic af.
---
Wait. You only have to do one meta and that's all? Or you have to do at least one meta in that specific tier time window? I'm extremely confused on how this rush works 8(
---
Heels would be awesome yes!! Personally the one thing I would like is some bigger and longer hairstyles, let me be a glamorous queen anet
---
Materials: Lots
---
Exotics: A few
---
Infusions: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Just to warn, some trainers (that are still training on EU side at least) will absolutely blame other raid members and people that are new to raiding for failings that are because of their leadership and strict adherence to what they think works when provided with evidence otherwise.
---
Don't let that deter you though, that means the person is a poor trainer and many of them continue to be poor and remain in their positions due to who they know.
---
Has anyone bought the game or expansions from Nuuvem? They're having a sale on HoT and I might pull the trigger but I want to make sure it's legit before I do
---
&gt;he/she/it
---
bro just say "they"
---
Ah yes the curse of sudden swiftness.
---
Nah didn't look for a healer you don't need a healer for every t4 fractal (makes things easier tho) Thing is that this was the first time happening to me. when i set this build up i hit 25k dops no problemo.
---
Thanks. Good to know
---
Yeah, I used to do Rich Iron &amp; Platinum before I picked up Fractals.  Sometimes Flax too.  These days it just doesn't feel worth it.  Maybe Flax, but even then...
---
Not like this has aways been a problem. Normally i hit enough damage. seems like something went wrong yesterday and that's what i'm trying to find out. I didn't ask for a lecture lol
---
Took me 2 damn years to beat that damn adventure, I've only managed to do it once, got gold, never been back. I consider it in my top two achievements in game, alongside beating Liadri
---
I'll look into that!
---
My guess would be that they don't want there to be a huge difference to how specs play/feel between game modes.  I dunno though.

TS is better quality audio and less of a resource hog than discord.

If you have the griffon you can do the adventures daily. Getting gold on them gives a lot of exp for the amount of time you invest (if you can get gold that is).
---
Please do post a rotation video, or at least screenshot with golem targeted so we can see what buffs you gave yourself and what conditions to the golem.
---
If you are comparing to the boon herald benchmark, then either you have wrong gear, traits, sigils/runes, food, buffs, condis on golem, bad rotation, or any combination of above listed things.
---
Thanks for all your answers. I think i will do a few meta events then :)

Adding VB would compete against Casino Blitz. Casino Blitz does not start on maps that are created after xx:05.
---
seeing everything you've provided so far, and now this comment, i'm inclined to believe that you were the only toxic one involved in this situation. your group carried you through the fractal, and only after that the healer informed you - in a to us unknown tone mind you - of your lower than to be expected performance, and yet you frame as if some toxic elitist came after you and that you obviously usually never do anything wrong. stories like these have a certain smell to them.
---
my intention here is not to point fingers, but to provide advice. your attitude is neither helpful or productive for groups you'll be a part of in the future, nor is it to yourself and your performance. it's never comfortable to get called out, but ultimately the only way to avoid that is to become decent enough at your role. labelling people that inform you of your lack of contribution as toxic elitists doesn't help anyone. you included, as you can clearly see by how this topic gets tilted off-course, in no small part due to your own words.
---
Well discretize claims 32+k dps with all boons + spirits+food + infusions. I realize the infusions will only add a bit, I misspoke concerning the infusions. You need to have optimal conditions to reach those numbers
---
It's probably the purest caster profession, but most have an element of caster-ness to them. The least caster-y is probably thief.
---
That's quite unfair imo. Logged in to the game I get but really the character!?
---
You don't have the rotation. There's a difference between hitting the right buttons, and hitting mostly the right buttons. There's a difference between hitting them at the right time as well.
---
I don't know Rev at all, but let's take Berserker, for example. I can hit all the right buttons, and hit them in the right order, but if I take 2 seconds longer to hit each of them, I'm going to lose my Berserker window. I'll miss my buff, and won't be able to use my primal bursts. Power BS is supposed to hit Decapitate 13 times during the Berserker window, but if I'm too slow on my rotation and only hit it 5 times, I'm going to see a massive loss of DPS.
---
Your problem is 100% going to be your rotation. Every time I've coached someone how to play a class, the reason they are far from the benchmark is because they fuck the rotation up. Mostly from hitting their skills too slowly, and trying to switch to the next phase of their rotation waaayyy to soon.
---
To side with everyone else in this thread; Your attitude on arc is wrong. This is how we know what your problem is, and know it's your rotation. Your shock of finding out your DPS was only 9k on the golem proves that you've spent no time working on it. The people who dump out 30k on fights don't do it from skimming over the rotation on SCs guide. It takes a lot of hours punching a golem, and punching it correctly. It takes doing these fights over and over, and being able to measure your performance, which can only be done with arc.
---
Bind all your skills to something you can hit comfortably. MMO mice do wonders. Most importantly, spend a fuck ton of time on the golem doing the rotation right. If you just try and play by ear in actual content, you'll do the rotation wrong. You do the rotation wrong, you'll form bad muscle memory, and bad habits. Keep doing it and then you'll end up doing 9k on the golem. And stop with the mindset that arcDPS is for elitists. If you where using it, you would have known sooner that you are massively under performing. There is such thing as toxic casuals.
---
Then their ignorance is their own doing. Repeated posts about the same thing that has been posted so many times before is the perfect example of why reddit has become very repetitive to look at sometimes. It only takes a couple of searches to find out if something has been posted before and is relevant. 
---
Instead OP could have made this something like a reminder , or reminder PSA. The video could be then seen as guide
---
The chak warrens and asuran architecture may be somewhat off the path, but they're strictly used in the path's events.
---
It's also possible the scrapped sectors were intended for a story step before Bitter Harvest - or perhaps the Bitter Harvest area was the 4th lane and the scrapped sectors were the original Bitter Harvest area in early designs. But I don't think we have enough proof to outright deny the existence of a 4th lane.

Yeah he was incrrdible insulting and toxic. You assuming things doesn‘t make it any better. At no point i stated that i „didn‘t do anything wrong“ like you suggested.
---
I don‘t want to point fingers „but“ *proceeds to point fingers*
---
Nono i was not toxic, i just left after he startet battering me with flaming. I even went to check my dps instead of just ignoring him.
---
Yes.

True, I gave up at some point

Taimi love &lt;3
---
S? lol okay, never knew that
---
Oh, okay. I haven't been playing much since the whole null hash thing, so I was just going based off what somebody else told me.
---
No, actually everybody loves Taimi. You must be a very horrible person... 
---
If you want to hate anybody, hate Braham. Everybody hates Braham (from LS3 to LS4), but leave Taimi alone!
---
That one gets very bright, but only in half of her body.
---
Of all the problems involving Taimi, the invention and use of long range communicator definitely isn't one, lol.
---
Playing PvP in the first place. Save your time and energy for a game actually built around it’s PvP experience.
---
I use arrow keys instead of wasd because I play left handed. I also put my skills on the numpad, which is very compact and accessible.

 My bet, is that he forgot to choose stats on jewelry after changes
---
Talking about spies in an action game. its kind of like eve online, but for monkeys.
---
Everyone in TEST is a spy, we know better than anyone.
---
Love Taimi tbh. Have long since given up on looking for convincing "fantasy talk" in this game, the lack of it originally irritated me but I've gotten used to it.
---
Ye! Just build the organisation around that fact and you'll be fine :D
---
Pockets of reality like fractals or the realm of the gods don't always fully loop. 
---
Sometimes they shift and change. 
---
Take Mystlock Obervatory and how it changed through the years. Yet after every change it resets again when people re-enter it.
---
If an event in a location is impactufl enough it probably affect the echoes of that place, like how Kessex and LA changed.
---
I got one infusion, but the materials alone are making like 2g profit *per meta completed*
---
Thank you, so far you are the only Person here Focusing on the Problem at hand instead of criticizing me into oblivion lol
---
i can't give gold but i can give this: 🥇
---
Or more like: organisation, what is that?
---
If the achievement shows that you miss 2 and 10, but the book doesn't have 3 and 7, you may should look for page 3 and 7?
---
Have you tried to collect all of them (again)?
---
For other style maps:  
---
A quick and simple to use build template UI could help some of the balancing issues that arise from having multiple and very different play styles due to map mechanics, but they would also need to swap your weapons automatically too.  
---
They would also need to put a lot more consideration into the flow of the game and player mindset when designing maps.  For example, Stronghold was full of features but I don't feel like it was well thought out or seriously tested before being released, and Courtyard actually has a very similar set of map design problems; The map designs don't do a good job forcing the issue.  
---
They already have a "Capture the Flag" style map built in, the "Snowball Fight Arena" (Capture the Gift), only available during Wintersday.  
---
The Dragonball arena has some promise too, though likely not very wide appeal tbh... To me that map looks and feels very much like FPS arenas.  
---
Only mentioning Dragonball Arena just because it's there and a bit closer to PvP than some of the other "Activities" like Keg Brawl, which could also be a kind of CtF if we could kill people instead of just knocking them down.
---
How are they fine as they currently are? Everyone shits might, you don't need to blast for anything. There are niche situations in niche gamemodes where blasting water for the heals does something. Is that 'mostly fine'?
---
Having more interaction like fire fields on cold fields causing vapour fields whic tick steals, blind and heat damage allows for much more variety and much more interesting mechanics.
---
Of course you can just cheese it my making blasts more powerful. Having chaos fields pop shittons of random boons while blasted, have fire fields pop a stronger version of might, have projectiles heal on top of granting regeneration. But we already got more than enough power creep.
---
Fact is, 2012 combo fields in 2019 suck. Well, they've always sucked with a few exception, and now they're even worse.
---
I run that build in raids but I do bench 27K on it. You are doing something wrong. it would be hard to tell without actually being with you when you are benching or watching a video. If you want some help, feel free to message me.
---
Nope i have stat locked ones, also i already wrote that i checked
---
&gt; Ideally, I’d want every node to be valuable enough to farm so that there’s a constant demand from veteran players to buy materials from newer/casual players.
---
That demand is there. Iron and platinum are still higher than mithril. Both are higher than elder wood, actually. Seasoned wood is about the same as elder. Cotton and Linen are like 5x the price of silk. And all players can still get these materials, readily, from gear drops. Nodes, to me, are and *should be* bonuses you harvest when you run across them, not something you plan to farm.
---
No, not everyone likes Taimi. Her constant talking can be really irritating.
---
TLDR:  I'm agreeing with this but with extra steps.
---
Successful completion of VB is also extremely counter-intuitive to the zerg mindset they had spent 2 or 3 years drilling into the playerbase, and still have not made any major attempts to curb IMO.  
---
Not that it's a bad thing to try and get people to think/act a different way, I'm only pointing out that the actual meta objective is very difficult to pull off BECAUSE it's so vastly different to what everything else in the entire game (that I can think of) asks of players.  
---
To illustrate:  To get VB's final meta reward you have to split a nearly full map of players into groups of ~4 on camps spread all over the map.  If you get a zerg on any camp, you lose and can not finish the meta.  
---
Meanwhile you have to have groups of 2-4 running around doing the smaller events, escorting supply carrying soldiers, defeating event-based veteran/champion mobs, running supplies to camps, etc.  You have ~20 minutes to get all the camps to max and if any camp fails at any point, you don't get t4 meta, but you still have to sit and wait through the rest of the night cycle.  
---
Then the bosses appear.  Some of them like the patriarch can be soloed pretty easily even, others call for groups of 6-10 and have mechanics you simply can't afford to miss frequently, so your groups need to have some idea of what they are doing.  If you zerg these bosses, their health pools and break bars tend to go insane and if you haven't already lost your ability to make VB night T4, the zerg mindset can still cost you even here at the end.  
---
An organized group (Almost has to have guild-type organization) where everyone knows what they are doing can achieve this very comfortably, even with a fair number of zerging randoms on the map.  
---
The real problem is that it's next to impossible to tell if the map you land on has enough bodies to begin with, and if enough of those bodies know how to do it, and if those knowledgeable bodies are willing to make it happen.  Too many moving parts generating way too much uncertainty in the wrong places makes this a poorly designed meta that is unreasonable to perform, even more so now that it's pretty ancient content with junk rewards outside of 1-time things like the Bladed armor chest box.
---
i really hate the jumping puzzles and just bought the gizmo - thanks for the tip!
---
if you did any of the affected events during the event you are good
---
I remember when people thought I was a spy...
---
&gt; As long as equipment is permanent and doesn't degrade, any player-to-player trading system will eventually collapse. 
---
Ooh, yes, I forgot this part of it. GW2 cannot be a fully realized economy, because there is zero entropy in the game. Nothing except consumables (which aren't necessary, and aren't hard to acquire) ever expires or is destroyed or damaged. As long as people play the game and are able to acquire anything, you will always have a situation where materials accumulate and need to be destroyed by throwing them at some new shiny or another. 
---
And that's fine. That's good! I don't want weapon degradation and upkeep costs. I don't want realism. I want my character to be 100% ready to go when I log in, regardless of where or how I logged out. If that means a part of the game I have neither the time nor interest in playing is not fun for the people who enjoy that, sorry, but I don't think they're the core audience.
---
that would worsen the main issue with combo's in this game (which is that if you want to use a specific combo somebody can fuck you over by complete accident by placing their own field on top of yours)

The legendary medium armor shoes have heels aswell :D.

Add a little muscle on your character model and throw on those ley-line armor pieces. 
---
Good to go, Mordremoth Sniper
---
That's the problem problem; you can just head to the matriarch nowadays and don't care about the rest of remaining bosses because you'll get the hero chest - I saw squads who were parked on the platform before meta begun and after killing wyvern, they just moved their squad onto next map for another two chests
---
No, you do not have to do any specific content to get geared; there are multiple avenues, though they all largely boil down to accumulating gold and/or other currencies and buying or crafting the gear you need.  Instead, cosmetics, not power, are what's linked to specific content.  Others have linked a couple gearing guides, and I suggest you read them.  Here's a condensed version to get you started though:
---
1) Get a full set of exotic gear.  Berserkers (Power, Precision, and Ferocity) is generally the best starting point for PvE, as it's the best for power builds, and every class has a viable power spec.  Buy off the trading post (use the filters to find the cheapest, don't just search "berserker"), craft it, orr buy with karma from temple vendors in Orr.  Off the TP, this usually costs around 10-12 gold; easily obtainable in a week just by doing your dailies.
---
2) Get ascended trinkets.  If you have Living Story episodes unlocked (and you have season 4, episode 6 at a minimum) farming their map currency is generally the best way.  Other reasonable options are laurels and fractals.  Note that fractals 1-20 can be done easily in just full exotics.  In general, this should take roughly another week.
---
3) Get an ascended weapon.  If you use shield, scepter, greatsword, sword, or dagger, and have the HoT expansion, I highly recommend completing the [Knight of the Thorn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight_of_the_Thorn) questline.  If you have either expansion, completing your specialization collection is a good option too, if you plan to use that weapon. Otherwise, you're probably best off crafting.  Use [gw2crafts](https://gw2crafts.net/) for the best route to 500 crafting in the relevant discipline. 
---
4) Get ascended armor.  There's a handful of collections that give free ascended armor, and it's technically possible to progress far enough in fractals to get ascended armor drops with just ascended trinkets and weapons, but it's generally recommended to just craft your first set.  It's expensive, but ascended weapons and trinkets are fine for everything except high-end fractals (yes, even raids) so getting it isn't as high a priority. 
---
And that's it!  Once you're in full ascended, you're done with the gear grind.  Note that if you want to run a condi build (often with Viper stats) or a support (Minstrel or Harrier, for the most part), crafting the ascended weapons and armor are likely to be more expensive than if you went with a basic power dps setup. Fortunately, there is a relatively cheap method to [stat-swap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) ascended gear.  So before you craft, do some research, and see if it might be better to craft something cheap with stats you don't want, then swap that to have stats you do want, as opposed to directly crafting what you want.
---
Finally, note that you don't have to get fully geared in ascended to dive into end-game content.  Nowadays, dungeons can be run in basically anything. Tier 1 fractals can mostly be done with just exotics.  Tier 2 fractals with just ascended trinkets. Tier 3 fractals, and most raids, with just ascended trinkets and weapons.
---
Well there you go. I stand corrected
---
That's pretty laughable to call it a remake.
---
Yep, and it did not difference other than giving me another book without chapter 3 and 7.
---
As a whole I agree with you, but you chose a bad example. 
---
Game of Thrones was unique as it's based of a fairly reknown fantasy book series. Seasons 1 &amp; 2 were still introducing "mysteries" so to speak that we have answers to. Unfortunately, the author let his story get away from him, in the later books/seasons things start getting introduced that ultimately, in one way or the other, unnecessary. Even then, it never got as bad as something as Lost or Dexter.
---
Additionally, what you see people currently complaining about in regards to GoT is basically lamenting the fact the latest 1-3 seasons are just your average tv show. Something the original seasons aren't. 
---
That said, as a whole, I agree with your point in regards to GW2, although I do think it's only one part of a multifaceted arguement.
---
Me and the boys watching other people hate on our meme.
---
Ya know linking to your post that has no evidence what so ever to support your post that has no evidence what so ever is.......well stupid.
---
Yep, we're planning on it! The bug thread will be removed.
---
Why one shot when you're holding [the gatlingbow](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rapid_Fire)?

I was so much into the new coming living world episode and totally forgot about it lol.
---
[Siegfried and Roy](https://gw2style.com/look.php?id=16404), not Elvis you plebs..
---
Don't bother with condi in open world, especially Condi Renegade given its slow condi ramp up time. And most enemies in open world don't run around much, which means you're not able to take advantage of the significant Torment output of Condi Renegade. You'll be able to demolish most Veterans quickly with Power Herald. Condi will only come out significantly ahead when you're fighting Legendaries, and you shouldn't have to solo Legendaries very often. Plus, Power Herald has better mobility anyway.   
---
In Raids though, it's a whole different scenario, but you prefer Open World so I won't explain too much.
---
I wish I could disable it, this happens all to often for me.
---
That's super great to hear
---
Is that really important?
---
Datamining and developer comments, but mostly the presence of [Duchess Chrysantea](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Duchess_Chrysanthea) in the designated area of the northern lane, the one themed on Auric Basin.
---
There's 9 isles in the final fight, 3 per lane, each containing characters from the outposts of the zone the lane is themed around. North contains two scrapped characters, the duchess being one, and [B.O.X.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/B.O.X.) being another.
---
This information has been posted multiple times on the subreddit, but there's still people claiming there was supposed to be a 4th lane (argument that has no actual proof at all).
---
Faolain wasn't supposed to transform that early into the plot (if ever), and the Nightmare Court was part of Auric Basin instead, having their own outpost. How early into development this was scrapped, I have no idea, might have never left the conceptual phase.
---
Hence the phrase "to a limited extent"
---
New player here... is there a way to sell/select multiple items to vendors? Instead of clicking each thing then hitting the sell button.
---
The portal device portals other players. For the personal device, you have to have been to the point of return to go there. For the portal device, players who haven't been there don't need to have gotten there before. If it's the same as a mesmer portal, it should have limitations. There's always the experimental gun, but that one only goes in short lines.
---
It will be especially pointless if they tweak it because it would take way too long.
---
&gt; But I don't think we have enough proof to outright deny the existence of a 4th lane.
---
There's zero proof there was a 4th lane though. Maps get sections scrapped or repurposed all the time (Dry Top underground, caves of Bloodstone Fen, etc), which doesn't mean they were once vital for the meta events of the map.
---
The burden of proof lies on those saying there was a 4th lane, not the other way around.
---
IMO making the Legendary Envoy Armor linked to raids was a huge mistake economy-wise.  Legendaries are one of the few effective sinks in the game, but linking it to raids reduced the pool of players that will pursue legendary armor substantially.  The provisioner tokens sink mats and make crafting somewhat relevant.  Looking at gw2efficiency, only about 30% complete the first series of raids.  Hall of chains and Mythwright are less than 10% having completed them.  Put in timegates, significant additional material costs, or whatever to balance out the non-raid acquisition and maybe you could entice a larger population to pursue.  The question is if it would be too little too late now with the massive piles of silk/leather on the market and if it would only serve to push up t5 trophies.
---
The more I use Skyscale the more I love it. Air raptor is so fast when used properly.
---
And let me see it on my own nameplate!
---
Where's the evidence for a 4th lane, or even a 5th? The burden of proof lies on your side, not mine.
---
That’s a lot of doom and gloom of a post title for some mid-aligned numbers, fam.
---
I first read your comment as "banana hairstyle" and was just... So much yes, and so much no.
---
Core has mastery points as well after HoT released.
---
The point is that you have very limited pvp experience, are more than likely horrible at pvp, and yet still think you make better builds than metabattle. This isn't a case of people being "fanboys" of meta builds. This is basically just a case of Dunning-Kruger.
---
This is why I don't use TS for WvW. They can't spy on your voice comms if you don't use voice comms. *taps head*
---
MOAR!
---
We need a more automated sink. Something that reads the current market/database/inventory and puts out requests for items that are overstocked or priced too low. Items requested change daily. 
---
A once/day turn-in earns currencies for both long-term goal items (skins, etc) and short-term consumables (mainly as a way to keep the system going when long-term rewards are expended). 
---
It wouldn't fix the *crafting* problem specifically (items not being used enough in high-level recipes, some items used to excess, etc), but at least the material markets would rise and even some things out.
---
Not really, the your speculation is just as good as their's.
---
You can double click or sort them better in inventory and just spam sell. Keep your important stuff on the very top/bottom so you dont accidentally sell them.
---
[There was never a 4th lane.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bxfobf/i_fell_out_of_bounds_in_dragons_stand_and_found_a/eq7rmid/)
---
The scrapped Nightmare Court storyline was part of Auric Basin, not Tangled Depths, so it would have belonged in the northern lane.
---
i noticed that when i watched a twitch stream with discord open it would constantly need to buffer, every 20 seconds or so. i'd always been suspicious of discord so i decided to close it and see if that fixed it, it did. i even opened up 2 streams (admiral bulldog and singsing, they were in the same game on opposite teams) and it still didn't need to buffer, but if i opened discord again twitch would go back to buffering every 20 seconds or so.
---
it's probably just an old meme now
---
That's what I'm wondering? Isn't this just the part where you throw the ball and run into the white circles to catch it?
---
I feel like I'm missing something here, like what was wrong that this needed a nerf?
---
"Joko's bored, let's pick up the pace"
---
I miss him, he was one of the best if not the best character Arenanet has done in my opinion. Would have loved to see more from his side of things throughout PoF and Season 4.
---
Looking back, really enjoyed this season, it had some very hype moments and felt immersive with solid story, great music, variety of maps, many collections to work towards to, and a good compromise between DS and SW in the Dragonfal's meta event (devs seem to have listened on this and came up with something really good).
---
The only lows for me were the map of Kourna that felt empty without the Gandara Fortress being explorable, and still can't get over how quickly Aurene died then revived, that felt rushed and could be weird for people who play all episodes in succession.
---
Google is your friend. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Meta-Event_Rush
---
Someone asked on the forums because he is handicapped.
---
but it's not even hard.. i play with a constant 250 + on a good day, 300 + every other day, and it was still easily doable, i only fucked up once and that was on the easy version when i got cocky. for those of you who don't know, 250 + ping makes it so that you have to dodge early or get into circles like that earlier, say if i see an attack coming and i dodge just before it should hit me, i still get hit. i have to dodge earlier because the server seems to register my dodge a little too late.
---
Just depends on what you like really. I'm very competitive in most games and love min-maxing whenever possible. I'm super uninterested in "endless grind" style MMOs like BDO and Archeage, but there's tons of people that love that.
---
It's entirely possible to make crafting+gathering enjoyable multiple types of players.
---
You also can grind some mapping materials and get cloth from map bonuses or wait for the most profitable week, sell whatever you get for them and buy the needed cloth at TP (which is better)
---
[Map bonus reward/profit page on wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_bonus_reward/profit)
---
That’s a one time thing more than an endless sink.  I’d attribute that to being the same as requiring boxes of fun for Quip/Energizer.
---
Or you can just kill them in the same amount of time it takes to drop those aoes by using sword/sword + staff. And this way you don't have to spend a minute waiting to get out of combat.
---
Unless you have, like, 400ms, this shouldn't be much of a problem. It seens the forum post is made by a disabled person, so it makes sense. That minigame is not supposed to stop anyone from getting the mount, so i see no problem with it getting a little nerf.

Well, obviously tyrian humans come in great variety of shapes and sizes.  Especially sizes.
---
that post makes me wonder how many senior citizens play this game
---
... but it already is? High heels already exist and are already impractical.
---
To be fair the hardest one, I only just made a few of the catchss
---
On a rare occasion anet releases a raid like once a year that is worth playing
---
You realize that high heels are ALREADY in the game, right?
---
Not wanting bads to crash your raid squads is a perfectly reasonable position to have.
---
Hell yeah, one of my favorite shield skins
---
My reflexes suck, so while I did manage to do this, i failed last round on last catch twice, I can see where it would frustrate people.  Me and jumping puzzles dont get along, but I can do some, cheese some, and get by with help from mesmers.
---
You didn't read, right? Get out troll. xD
---
I learned that the first time I failed, when it lands on the opposite side of the area.  I have good ping, but crappy reflexes/motor control sometimes, I need all the help I can get.
---
so... it's easy just buy LW map? Sorry, the game costs enough, I'm not spending money on LW.
---
I had no luck with wine. I tried doing as you said and it just crashes my computer.
---
People who want to learn are more than welcome to join training runs, but they have no place in experienced only runs. This isn't a new idea and it isn't unusual so don't act so shocked by it. The LFG exists for a reason, and people are free to make a group with whatever requirements they want.

People who are unwilling to learn and just want a free ride have no place in raids at all, and by extension they game. Which is why I said they should quit. Yeah it's harsh, but so is expecting a free ride with zero effort, and I'm not afraid to call people out on that toxic behavior, mainly because after raiding for years, that stuff gets old and wastes everyone's time.
---
Pretty sure you're just reading it wrong and they're saying that consensual is what would be fine - yeah it's phrased a bit weirdly but there's no reason to add "consensual" in there except to differentiate it from the alternatives.
---
Either way I can promise you it happens *all the time* in private in-game chat and no one ever gets hit for it.
---
Yes please. Clear all the spam off of the front page
---
I get that. This is different though because it's a one time event.
---
Poor man's pixelart assemble!
---
I sometimes forget that mystlock is a premium area given how much I use the damn thing.  I recently started working on my alt more, and not having it is a real pain.
---
Spying is really only useful in bigger groups actions or quick raids to know where people are or arent.
---
I dont even see that useful in today's wvw.  BG shows up with 40 to map queue and we have 10 if lucky, no spying is helping us.
---
The one time I did spy was actually watching/listening an enemy comm live twitch streaming.  It was funny as hell.  We wiped him a number of times in a row with us having maybe half his zerg number.  He kept getting more and more pissed at the people in his zerg at how bad they were, yet he knew we were probably watching/listening to his twitch stream.  He would tell his plans ahead of time in twitch on what he wanted his zerg to do and where to go.  LMFAO
---
There's an option for that in the setting
---
Oh cool thanks
---
Plenty of dungeon solos on youtube, some are even from before elite specs. Check those builds and try something similar.
---
Can we get a resin kit of this? Drools\*
---
iirc it's half zerker half diviner armor, zerker weapons, zerger trinkets, diviner back.
---
Don't spam skills off cooldown?
---
This game isn't designed to allow players to stack defenses off cooldown and dance around content.
---
doubt they're related
---
&gt; As a result, even if I apply aegis 5 times in a row, it'll only block one attack in the end, and the benefits from that will only apply once.
---
which allows for player skill to play a more important role.. in knowing when to re-apply it at just the right moment, rather than just spamming everything as soon as it's off cooldown
---
MM Reaper full zerker is pretty decent for doing dungeons solo.
---
The reason people don't do it solo, is because it is just so time consuming, yu might as well get a couple of pugs or friends and do it quicker.
---
Pretend I just linker the pikachu pic with open mouth. 
---
Thanks bud!
---
Some dungeon paths are next to impossible to solo without skips being used, such as Rhiannon's Path in Citadel of Flame which required lighting three torches within a short time of one another.
---
Others can totally be soloed with patience and a good build. I have a Dragon Hunter that can solo quite a few paths, and a Herald that can do the same. I'm sure Reapers or Minionmancers would also be viable routes to take. But understand that some of these paths, without using skips, mandate multiple players
---
If I remember right, the story is something along the lines of the dragons being necessary to maintain the world, but something drove them insane so they just kept devouring everything. So they're bad, but killing them is also bad.
---
Only thought is to add a conditional to update the extras and build templates as well! I would do a push myself but I don't know C#. :)
---
and trash for dungeons.
---
The light zodiac armor set has some proper stiletto boots, if you wanna check them out (not on charr and asura though). I think they're badass. :)
---
&gt; even if I apply aegis 5 times in a row, it'll only block one attack in the end
---
Then don't do it. Aegis is an insanly strong boon that allows you to protect your allies from telegraphed attacks deal heavy damage or cc.
---
Basically saying that better survival with tweaked build is not as good as build that I can't play fully.
---
Yeah I better keep dying than actually play the way I can support team more. And after I learn basics, learning the bestest thing is also bad idea since I should start with top build in the first place.
---
Well played..
---
Kind of missing my point but the answer is sort of in there. I'm thinking I should just look at some fractal bosses to get a clear picture of how the fight progresses.
---
I'm not expecting to actually spam all of my skills at once, that's pointless. However it still means that for every aegis I apply, there's a chance it's going to be wasted. Also, it's not like these skills ONLY apply aegis, they do other useful functions I need, so it's not like I can just wait to use them just because the passive aegis from Virtue of Courage hasn't procced yet.
---
That sort of attention to one boon, when there are so many other more reliable boons, skills, and traits that don't require that sort of absurd timing, dedication, and coordination is why I think aegis just *sucks*. No high end build gives those traits a passing glance, except perhaps Unscathed Contender, but even those builds only really use Virtue of Courage and nothing else for aegis application.
---
Aegis is most overpowered boon in the game for all gamemodes, period.
---
I don't really like tanking SH not only because of the visual clutter, but specially because you have to play with insane toughness if you intend to survive (I'm talking about playing with PUGs). And her movement is like, *super* weird, sometimes you're 10 feet away from her and she just stops there instead of getting close to you, which makes it really hard to prevent her from hitting people around. And I won't even talk about what happens when Gigantor (one of those huge walls) appear out of the blue and f* you deep.
---
Necromancer is probably the easiest solo class out there for dungeon running. Once you get good enough though, many aspects of the game can be done solo regardless of profession
---
Some mechanics won't be possible since they actively require multiple people to interact with.
---
And crafting, kind of yeah. You can get top tier gear/food/utilities through crafting, which is always helpful, but it's not entirely necessary because there are other ways to get gear if you want to do so. Before you reach level 80, most crafting is pretty pointless but it does give you experience, so that's also nice.
---
Indeed, and he's grossly overtuned when you compare him to a "normal" champ. Even the veteran branded ley line anomalies nearby have ridiculous health scaling.
---
Then why don't you unlock another 3 character slots when you already have core game and buy an expansion?
---
Unless KC ( also escort but for this one who care ) and if you don't expect to speedrun bosses you can do everything on Renegade with a decent DPS (15k minimun on worst bosses with only the axe/mace rotation ).

Will defo dowload this, my only other recommendation for lazy hambones like myself is to add a delete function for ArcDps as I often don't need it and for whatever reason it can cause me crashes sometimes, so I prefer getting rid of it in the downtime mid-week.
---
There are very few bosses where you actually need high toughness. Xera can be tanked on very low stats if you're paying close attention to her attacks. The bosses I recommend running a higher toughness: VG and SH. All the others is kind of a personal preference thing.
---
I'm noticing that as well. Even as early as the first dungeon even with the traps. Dodge doesn't evade them, and aegis SOMETIMES blocks the flame jets on the stairs and at other times doesn't. Is this inconsistency something learned or just an inherent dice roll?
---
Okay so a boon guardian could really increase dps for a group, not only because of quickness and such, but because aegis can allow the party more time to actually attack. Of course, I don't expect this to be useful for ALL bosses, but if it's an ideal set up for at least some bosses that's pretty exciting.
---
Try r/guildrecruitment to see if you can join a guild to help you out
---
Also, for world events, look on the GW2 wiki event timer. That should tell you when all of the big world events are happening that are on a timer. Some big meta events don't show up because they're based on the map instance, rather than being set, so you'll just have to spend time in those maps to really experience them
---
How is it worse to get a new third effect instead of having the intended first effect overwritten by the usual second effect? Either you get the field you want or you don't. At least having more variety allows for more impactful gameplay than 'whirling bolts' do right now.
---
Another quick question, what profession do you think depends the most on skill? Becoming better is what I'm after and I'd like a class that could show that
---
Because those slots were already unlocked if you owned the core game
---
The basic version of the game comes with 5 slots. The f2p version is like the basic version but limited, so it's only available with 2 slots. The expansions work off of the basic version of the game, hence, 5 slots. You aren't adding slots with the expansions, you're just taking away slots for the f2p version

One and only true Tarzan of gw2:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Mini\_Jungle\_Lord\_Faren.jpg](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Mini_Jungle_Lord_Faren.jpg)
---
But it is barely a race, that is the issue and I'm not sure that people downvoting my points understand or appreciate that. Compare what happened with either of the last two raid "races" with the last two in WoW and it will be clear that Guild Wars 2 can't even support a raiding environment that allows competitive first kills.
---
go in game, click top right 'meta event rush' click show me - do those events.
---
I hate to inform you that, to introduce the raid, a patch is required... Patches bring bugs.
---
&gt;Relying less on AOE indicators and more on actual animations (does not work for everything obviously) is an important skill to pick up.
---
Definitely noticed that. I played ESO before this, and the telegraphing was much better in general (there's a lot of things I liked better actually but lets just say that everything in GW2 feels like it was made by people who just love games, so GW2 &gt; ESO).
---
If there are any approved addons or options that could reduce on-screen clutter that you know of, it would certainly help. For the human sized bosses I sometimes can't even SEE the animation.
---
3 slots per expansion would be ludicrous. This would also mean that people would get 3 per expansion (something f2p don't get either, even with your warped logic, they get 1 per expansion just like everyone else and on top of that get rid of the restrictions that lock 2 the first time they buy an expac). Expecting a game with 9 classes to give you 11 character slots, by buying 2 products is pretty unreansonable.
---
This would also mean that the non-discounted version of PoF would basically be: buy 3character Slots for the regular price and get the whole expansion for free on top.
---
I do think this is something that excites me about GW2 though. The variability means that the best build for one boss may not be the same for another. I like that and can work around that. It still means that aegis can be super useful in one place even if it's not as much in others.
---
If it actually does this, it would be useful. It won't though as people will still post first kill threads for the few fights that matter while the "raid race" sticky thread won't contain much of that as raiding in Guild Wars 2 doesn't even support progression raiding...
---
Raiding discussion megathread with tactics and information and discussion? Yes please.
---
A thread for what amounts to who gets the last boss first on CM even though Anet have shown that they will disrupt fair competition if the names raising issues are big enough? Not worth it.

Uh no. It's the ones listed here: [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/weeklong-bonus-event-meta-event-rush/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/weeklong-bonus-event-meta-event-rush/)
---
2019
---
fuck's sake
---
My first thought would be to look at the properties of Gw2-64.exe and check if it has read and write permissions.
---
you wouldnt believe the potatoes some people play on
---
i dont :(
---
Best answer.
---
I'm still looking at a support firebrand setup. I'm personally not a big fan of getting +15 skills on my skill bar, it's just too much and it's not like you can use them all at once or at any time anyway so it feels rather inconsistent and choppy for reliable gameplay. (If I'm being honest, it's simply not my idea of fun, I prefer fewer skills with a greater impact, used at the right time for the greatest effect) If you ignore the tomes altogether and just rely on mantras that's different, I suppose, but the only skills outside of Virtue of Courage that apply aegis reliably would be the 4th skill when holding a shield and the "Retreat!" shout skill, neither of which appear to be optimal to slot for any type of guardian build. That being said, I do love shield and shout skills, so I'm trying to find a way to work with them.
---
Since traiting into aegis also represents DPS loss (seriously, why do half of the guardian traits give like +10% damage for this or that), even if it may be good for a support build, it doesn't sound worthwhile... is what I'm getting at? Some of those traits aren't really good for support anyway. The one that heals on block is probably the only one worth getting, and even then you probably wouldn't get the skills that apply aegis to go with it.
---
I'm really getting the sense that chronomancer is better for the role aegis needs to apply. So I looked into it and... well they have the "Well of Precognition", which I assume is what you're talking about. Not only is it a group aegis spell with a reasonable cooldown timer, it can pulse 3 times make it more reliable for blocking attacks than anything the guardian has. It feels a bit depressing that with all the aegis related skills and traits the guardian has, this one skill on the chronomancer is just... BETTER.
---
I did forget that the mantra healing skill applies block, so maybe that's where all the magic happens then.
---
Meh, I solo dungeons a lot with my MM reaper, and I can knock most of them out in half an hour each. Would bringing friends/pugs make it faster? Sure... but only if you don't account for the time it takes to actually get a group together. By the time I could get people together and get everyone to the dungeon and ready to go (because somebody always has to bank or screw around first), I could be halfway through it solo.
---
That's not to say that doing it with friends or even pugs isn't fun or efficient, it's just not always ideal (or always what I'm in the mood for -- I solo as a sort of de-stress, when I specifically do not want to interact with others or ratchet up my anxiety by speedrunning).
---
And, of course, players who utilize skips and builds that are ideal for that can speed through the dungeon faster than most groups, anyway. I'm slow.
---
That's not the build's problem, though. That's a l2play issue. A player who can only press 1 over and over might do better with a build that only focuses on auto attacks, but that doesn't mean the build is better than the meta build.
---
As a shield guardian, I end up clearing close to a dozen stacks of conditions during big events with one 5 skill. It’s not that bad
---
But if you are F2P and buy an expansion you get 3, if it's going to cost the same why don't owners get it as well?
---
I would assume you just need to set the permissions for your own account, but it probably doesn't matter if you allow all of them read and write permission.
---
ty! btw i wanna make a new guide if you have questions or something just ask and may i can implement something into it. :)
---
You don't really spec into specific Aegis builds. You just *have access* to Aegis. Use it when you are about to eat a big attack. That's it. You're not sacrificing anything by having Aegis, there's no trade-off.
---
The Garbo old one?
---
Dunno, I use a variant of [this .cmd file](https://gist.github.com/OneFaced/764f9c5c7bef1c49a31d928c223bcb24). Easy to read and modify for your needs, and does an ok job.
---
Really just jump into the wardrobe and preview skins til you find a combo that you like. 
---
(Also I guess that posting costumes/cosplays on this sub is super common now, but there is a separate sub for fashion stuff /r/GuildWarsDyeJob)
---
You sacrifice by having skills that grant aegis reliably, would be my biggest point. I'm okay with ignoring the aegis traits altogether, but Virtue of Courage does not apply aegis very often, and the elite specializations make its CD even longer than it already was.
---
The healing mantra on fireband does apply aegis though, so that seems the best way to apply aegis "as needed" to block powerful attacks. Since mantras are pretty damn strong and it could stack to provide quickness on firebrnad, it's actually optimal to have this skill on, unlike using shield skills or the "Retreat!" shout.
---
Basically, all in all, I'm feeling better about Aegis because it can represent a major DPS boost if your allies don't have to dodge those attacks. That's the sort of thing I was looking for. However, it also seems that chronos are the ones typically used for this role, not guardians, so that's a bit depressing.
---
Nope
---
Yup, was gonnq copy my post on there as well. And welp I wouldve done the wardrobe scouting myself but I dont have any character slots left and none of my toons are female so I have nooooo clue what their side of the wardrobe looks like, hence the asking :)
---
Because you already had the 3 that the F2P people get. They're not getting more than you, they're just catching up with what you had all along.
---
So what is the bonus for having originally bought the game, you may ask? You got to play it sooner, and you had those extra 3 slots the whole time. That's a choice you make when you buy an MMO early on, knowing full well that many MMOs *do* eventually go to a F2P model of some sort. It's no different than choosing to buy a new game when it's still new, and paying full price, knowing that eventually it will be discounted and other people may be able to buy it cheaper if they wait (and that there will almost certainly be some kind of value bundle if you, too). You are making the choice that you want to play the game *now,* even though you know you'll get more for your money if you're patient.
---
Basically... stop whining. You got exactly what you paid for.
---
200 gems per chapter.  Yeah, it's easy.  Currently, you have access to Dragonfall which is the most profitable map available with the easiest map currency to farm.  You can easily build enough gold and VM to buy shipments to sell for extra gold to buy more maps with gold to gems.
---
I did this on an alt account with zero access to crafting, no help from my main, and still unlocked all of season 4.  It's completely possible to do this.
---
As stated before: This is not the case. You get 1 for the expansion. It's just the case that the base game is rolled for free into the expansions - to no benefit of players who already have the base game, but for owning the game you got years and years in which you were able to play the game when it wasn't f2p.
---
I'm glad that the Support for older OS versions gets dropped from time to time, so we get ride of the worst potatoes.
---
I mean any "gamer" in 2019 with less 8GB of ram in their machine is just asking for bottlenecks left and right.
---
but 250 is nothing. i did it with 1 character in less than a week and played every day ~2 hours.
---
That was kind of the idea behind HoT.  You take the time to master the difficulties of the jungle so assault moredemoth.
---
Aside from that,  I think you just havent taken part in some of the more generous xp events that are around such as tarir or a hero point train.
---
your computer catches fire from a few effects? get a better pc.
---
What do you mean?
---
What do ectoplasmic stones do exactly?
---
Going off of the other comment, if you use the event timer to do the core Tyria world bosses (ie Fire Elemental, Shadow Behemoth, etc) you can sometimes join a "boss train" where people will just bounce around to the different world bosses as they pop up every 15ish minutes
---
HoT was a rapid departure from the core game in terms of grind and difficulty, so much the shock you're experiencing now is pretty much the norm for all players.
---
They dialed it back a little bit in PoF, so it's more like a middle ground.
---
&gt;I am loving GW2, my wife and I
---
I like this order.
---
&gt;missing something super simple?
---
Participate in meta events with boosts to EXP (from guild, food, boosters, fireworks, banners). It wont take much time to unlock stuff you need.
---
Challenges also provide good chunks of exp.
---
Oh **gottem!**
---
No, this is correct. You have to put some work into the HoT masteries, and this is best done by playing the map meta events. Story progression is indeed gated by the mastery system in that regard, which a lot of people have criticized early on. 
---
As a result, the same issue only repeats in PoF if you rush like hell. PoF masteries are trained much quicker, which some people liked, and some people found lackluster. 
---
Now, what can you do in HoT? My personal advice is to change your mindset. Don't "play to train masteries", play AND train masteries. The HoT maps offer a lot of exciting events and a very nice meta event structure that rewards tons of EXP. Explore the maps casually, find people to do hero points, etc. The masteries will train in no time if you are not counting every point of EXP, and the exploration won't feel like a chore if you do it for its own sake, not just to fill a bar. 
---
I think the main failure of the mastery system is that people just progress in such different ways. For me, earning the EXP for the masteries was an awesome journey of exploration, and even when it got definitely grindy, it was still fun to me. I grinded a lot of HoT EXP doing the meta events in Bloodstone Fen. 
---
Story locks are indeed annoying as they exist in HoT, but sadly that was never fixed. Hang in there! Play and train masteries, don't play /to/ train masteries!
---
I made [something similar](https://i.imgur.com/xwMMdqG.png) for personal use a year or so ago. It's very bloated with lots of extra stuff so I could learn about it. OP could so something similar.
---
Very nice. Still working on mine, hopefully people like it better than the one i did for S3, but it's fun to make regardless.
---
The masteries that you need to play the story are very few and there should be no need to grind much to get the mastery points and XP to unlock the story steps. 
---
Getting all HoT masteries maxed is quite a bit more grindy (Although I would consider core tyria the most grindy set). 
---
There are a few other things that you might notice though: while it has been heavily nerfed Hot has much harder open world mobs than vanilla or PoF and a lot of the maps revolve around meta events that you might not be able to finish all on your own, but will need a somewhat coordinated map.
---
As hinted at before: masteries in PoF are way less grindy, basically become a non-mechanic and are not needed in order to progress the story at all.
---
HoT is designed in the same way as Metroid or Castlevania games. You're intended to go through the maps normally, curiously noting areas you can't reach yet. Once you aquire a new mastery, some of those unreachable areas become available, so you go back and explore those areas.
---
The masteries aren't intended to really gate you from doing content; almost everything has a "normal" way to access it. Masteries are meant to give you a new way to travel through areas you've already completed, and open a few small "unlockable" areas. The amount of places that are truly inaccessible without masteries is probably much fewer than you think.
---
Conclusions from the roles played by the Dragon's Stand NPCs plus some datamined texts. Nothing 100% solid though, just hints.
---
We'll never really know until ArenaNet tells us, but I'm 100% confident the 4th lane was never a thing.
---
There is no period after the layoffs where this is appropriate to discuss here.
---
Pls get a Spoiler Tag
---
Good job putting spoilers in the title 👍
---
HoT's mastery requirements are actually a lot less than they used to be at launch. Most of my friends who played since launch never got through it, even after all of the nerfs. But they didn't get through PoF either, which had way less reliance on unlocking all of the masteries. Masteries as a requirement to get around is something that's in stark contrast to the base game. Just think of it like a gear or level requirement. Guild wars had to pick a progression system and instead of a gear treadmill, this is what we ended up with. 
---
If you follow event chains, you'll get through the masteries easily. It's really not insurmountable. You just need to keep an eye on LFG.
---
Go away.
---
Dungeons, fractals, pvp, WvW, those are your really big standard MMO things
---
Make a new character and do it again
---
Hunt for achievements, increase your crafting level, farm for gold in the silverwastes, etc.
---
It's unfortunate that guardians don't do a whole lot of guarding. I started GW2 with a guardian and quickly realised it was a semi-squishy burst damage class. You're right to have noticed all those damage-increasing traits, because those are the things that make guardian strong, not the defensive skills attached to certain weapons. Guardian has not much to do with what the class name inspires in terms of role and fantasy.
---
My favorite thing to imagine with this is that *immediately* after the ship crashed he stripped himself bare and went into full survival mode, only to be rescued a few hours later.
---
Are you really proposing that we list reasons that we hope people lost their jobs for? Are you really celebrating 100 people being put out of work? This thread is disgusting dude.

Nooooooooooo I really like them :p

Coming to think of it, why not make a list of 100 community members we could do without? I'll start:
---
1. RareEfficiency
---
I agree. Coming into HOT after most of the initial issues had been ironed out, I found the grind to feel just right. PoF's masteries, in turn, were done so quickly that I found it hard to acknowledge them as a system.
---
I am not inherently offended by the concept, but your reasons 1 and 2 are shallow trash
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Simple_Artificer%27s_Backpack kinda looks like it could be an old-timey mailbox 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Simple_Scribe%27s_Backpack could be a letter being delivered?
---
I actually think number 1 on your list here is a good thing. It kinda would be too easy if you could just mount in combat and run away from every single fight.
---
Ew. Condi Dragonhunter or bust
---
Ok I'll ad to your list, why don't you add to mine?
---

I'd settle for my aegis not being stripped when i'm using blocking skills like focus 5 or DH f3.
---
I bought the invisible shoes just for this, to runs twinsies with faren in VB. Still waiting for a toggle on chest.
---
You might wanna look into this:
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype\_Position\_Rewinder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder)
---
Not so much the reasons but the people that were included, like the two I  mentioned
---
It is totally different. You can either craft or buy from the trading post all your gear from levels 1 to 80, try to do it every 10 levels. If you don't want or can't spend coins, you can also get all the required gear you'll need to level up from personal story rewards and from hearts. Once you unlock a heart the NPC becomes a vendor and most of them sell armor/weapons of Masterwork quality.
---
Those are the methods of acquiring gear from levels 1 to 80 and its different because you are not farming an instance or a boss, but the whole world. You have options, focus on playing not farming. That's the motto of ArenaNet.
---
From level 80, there is some sort of gear treadmill which is totally optional and up to you to complete with Ascended gear. It's around 7% better than a Exotic set, but 10 times more expensive. Ascended weapons and armor can only be crafted or found in Ascended loot chests from Fractals. Ascended trinkets can be crafted, found in chests, obtained from achievement rewards or bought with laurels and other currencies from special vendors. Trinkets are kinda easy to get, you'll spend more time trying to craft armor and weapons.
---
In short, you have 2 guides that list all the different ways of obtaining gear:
---
* https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character
---
* https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:How_to_Gear_a_Character
---
With that knowledge, gear yourself the best you can. If you still need some kind of guide/suggestion on what to do, step by step regarding gear and content relation, use this:
---
* From levels 1 to 79, use whatever gear you want and play any dungeon along the way, don't take them too seriously. 
---
* At level 80 focus on buying/crafting a full set of exotic armor. Now you have "better" gear to run dungeons properly and can start playing fractals.
---
* Once you understand the game and have a source of gold revenue, focus on crafting ascended armor and begin playing raids.
---
That's the most step by step you can get in a game when you can raid in greens, if you want. Learning to play your class is way more effective than better gear. Try this: Defeat a Veteran mob of your level without trinkets, armor or weapons. Try to defeat it with no gear at all. If you can't, then there is room for improvement in your build.
---
The traits are usually ignored because traiting for that typically means pretty large DPS loss. Unscathed Contender is obviously an exception that some people use to increase damage, but it sort of has the opposite problem in that it doesn't play well with the others. You only get the 20% boost to damage if aegis DOESN'T proc, so it lacks a lot of synergy with aegis itself and the idea that you should only grant aegis when you're about to block an attack. So unscathed contender is great if you assume you're dodging attacks, not blocking them. Then you can just keep aegis up from Virtue of Courage and everything's all good.
---
I've often considered Mystic Rebuke, but it doesn't seem worth it compared to +10% damage when enemies are in a symbol and +130 power (without increasing toughness). Does it happen on the enemy who causes the block, or around the player? If the former, it would seem more worth it. Still doesn't explain why it doesn't crit though, seems like a silly restriction that just begs for it to not be used.
---
Yeah I have no idea what's going on with like 70% of the posts/comments on this sub lmao. I'm just playing through the old LS and doing world events for the most part.
---
Lmk if you have any luck finding people to run fractals with though, I'm actually in the same boat because I need to run a couple of specific ones for the legendary I'm working on
---
I mean both Blizzard and Bethesda aren't doing so hot, either, so maybe you do have cause for concern. Fallout 76 what? Cancelled StarCraft games, huh?

I see the ability usage one constantly. People just mindlessly run through a rotation. It's definitely good to learn them but you need to be able to adapt to your opponent. Being easily predictable is really bad.

Arah still has paths that cannot be soloed

Fuck you.

Undercutting and reselling ERP to others is the real endgame.

I bought the contracts for only hundreds of gold because they used to be significantly cheaper before shared inventory slots.  Only took selling a legendary.
---
I feel they only made the mistake in trying to do 3 episodes with Joko and 3 with Kralkatorrik. If we had 6 episodes showing both of them, with Joko refusing to work with us as Kralktorrik rampaged and the entire thing was a 3-way war between the allied forces, Joko, and Krak, it would have been enough time to feel fun.
---
I'm also miffed because the entire OoS red herring about them not being up front about their goals never came up, and that it felt like the season had too many riding threads that didn't tie up nicely. The season definitly felt like it was going through a lot of last minute rewrites and didn't have enough time to come to complete conclusions.
---
That said the largest story beats (Joko dying in a climactic duel after monloguing at us for 30 minutes, the pact fights Kralkatorrik both at Thunderhead and at Dragonfall, the raid on Rata Primus and the Elonian summit at Jahai) were all still fun to do and enjoyable. I just wish they had done *more* with the season, which seems to be a pretty common sentiment.
---
I'd love for him to just buy out the entire consortium and then hire us to stamp out all the shady shit he's found in there. Maybe something in like 5-man instances around the world, with multiple paths for each zone.

Well he asked for solo build not a speed build.

Wow, I haven't play GW2 in a while, but I'm already updating to get this. I had no idea this existed. Thank you very much kind stranger.

As some1 who hates Zerg mentality I love VB and other HoT metas since they split up the zerg but I realize I’m in the minority

The third one looks like a mess of light (may just be angle/other factors though) but the others actually look kinda nice.

No need to thank me, just enjoy it :)

Thing is, non-banner warrior can work, and pull pretty decent numbers, however, itll be pretty tough to join a pug as a DPS warrior. Its this crappy situation ANet has warriors in, where they have unique and super powerful buffs, but one warrior can bring both. This means that one warrior is a must have, but a second warrior will be pretty meh, akin to a necro. Currently, DPS warrior gets outclassed in DPS, but also, if another warrior is bringing banners, it brings nothing to the group. So why would a group get a second one? The answer is only if they really need a fill. However (again), DPS is one of the easiest slots to fill in raids and fractals, so groups can be somewhat picky.
---
Again, does this mean you cant ever find a group that will take a warrior as pure DPS? No, of course not. But it will be an uphill battle (with at least a small slope). You dont even have to believe a random reddit poster either, you can go on gw2radar and look up recent group comps, checking how many pure DPS warriors were in them.
---
Necro isn’t really great for soloing tough content because their tank mechanic is to soak. Compare to a thief or warrior with loads of evades and/or blocks in their kits and you’ll see that while necro is awesome at lots of little mobs in open world, it can’t really handle a lot of actual mechanics. I personally would recommend warrior, great personal dps, high health and armor, , many cc options, good bit of utility, and lots of baked in evades and blocks. 
---
Though really, may just want to explore groups. It’s an MMO, most of the “end game” content isn’t made with solo in mind. Solo is more of a personal challenge/peen presentation. Grouping for most things isn’t really toxic, and it can be pretty fun to go through things smoothly and see everyone interact.
---
I think the tree doesn't help either haha, but it's the only screenie I had of that character
---
Mystic Rebuke doesn't crit because that was a time where the meta was to combo Communal Defences with Mystic Rebuke and you can imagine how broken that was.
---
How can it be easier than its current state ?!
---
I like your interpretation of it. It definitely felt rushed. I absolutely despised it and almost quit the game right there. It was really lazy story telling. Yes, your audience knew she would come back (in the very same way you know a main character from a TV show would come back next episode "because you can't kill him/her off"), but that doesn't mean they have to take the most obvious of ways to do it, let alone RIGHT at the beginning. After watching the guild chat it felt like their interpretation of it was like, "well, we knew you knew she would come back, so why bother. Let's just move past it quickly and screw any character development." There were just so many interpretations the fans had for HOW she would come back (I liked the idea of having her ascend before Kralk kills her and she is in the mists and helps us kill Kralk from there), but they just took the quickest, easiest way and I'm really annoyed at how so many people just brushed that off as "yeah, but we knew she would come back."  
---
And then she spoke. Ugh. I'm really getting tired of the cutesiness of the storytelling as well. But her child like voice just really 'irked me. And then we were off to kill Kralk, because why not.   
---
It's not like it took an entire army to attack him last episode or anything. Nah. We'll just hop on a dragon that just came back from the dead and one shot him a few times. Down he goes. We did it! Yay! \*sigh\*  
---
Now don't get me wrong, that fight looked beautiful, but how it worked seemed equally lazy. The entire fight felt like it was on rails. I didn't have any sense that I was actually flying Aurene. You could barely move when the rocks were being thrown at you. It was like playing quick time events from an older game.  
---
Then we just whip up a dragon spear in two sentences and scream at it. Who needs a forge? Was there ever a forge? I wonder what that exalted is doing now? He's last episode though so screw 'em.  
---
And then Aurene sucks up some magic and flies off. Why couldn't Glint, Aurene or Ogden just tell us she can be resurected by Joko's magic? They all knew Joko was a part of Glints prophecy. Ogden literally says so at the beginning of the last episode.
---
Despite my major dislikes about this story there were a few things I did like:   
---
\- The ending fight and conversation with Kralk was beautiful. (though it could have been a little more difficult).  
---
\- The map meta is really fun! Fighting through Melandru's Realm/The Underworld/Fissure of Woe with new enemies was awesome!  
---
\- The conversations between each group at the three camps (Rytlock/Logan/Gwen, Rox/Bottica, Caithe/Zaiem).  
---
\- The Skyscale collections/unlock. I know a lot of people didn't like this, but I enjoyed it. The change to the 2hr delay vs. 24hr delay was needed though.  
---
There were a few twitter posts from that woman who was fired stating they didn't even know if their would be a season 5 or next expansion after season 4 so they tried to write an ending. Maybe that explains some of the rush. Or maybe she just lied again. Who knows. I'll still check out season 5, but I'm very suspect now on the future of this game and the direction of it's story.
---
This is a bonus event, we don't need it to become something more than it is. Its meant to incentivize to alter your playstyle for X amount of time. Anything more than that and it loses the vision of what it is.
---
Take a look!
---
This meme can die, btw. They've already confirmed that they're working on them.
---
Very meh.
---
Pog console room strats
---
If you are core, use the meta battle fractal banner slave warrior build as a guide line if you want to be “the best”. Luckily that build uses core warrior and berserker/assassins stats which are all very accessible to non expansion players.
---
Thanks! Exordium is probably the hardest weapon to screenshot in action, especially if you also want your character to be a significant part of the shot; the greatsword is so [massive.](https://i.imgur.com/c76GbBA.png)
---
it will die when i will see it inside the
---
 game , until then , it's on the fantasy table.
---
Especially with the Skyscale. Its really easy to collect those balls of magic now and in some spots you get well over 200k xp for 2 or 3 minutes work.
---
For PvE ya, though the timing of some bosses hits is just impossible to do with the amount of aoe they have.
---
For PvP and WvW however its near useless.
---
Armor!
---
That line of "clones" you saw is a guy using some multibox tool to play several accounts at once. In EU there's usually 1 guy in the morning doing TD with up to 8-9 identical characters all equiped with Halloween red infusions. After Gerent has been defeated they all stand in line in front of the wall before it collapses. Long time ago there was a guy doing the same in GW1 with tons of dupilcates, maybe it's the same guy, who knows?
---
Anyway, between that and the DPS-meters fisco running rampant GW2 sure went down the hill with the "no 3rd party tool allowed" policy.
---
Woah, its already tier5? Damn am i glad i managed to squeeze out an VW
---
Toothless should be completely obscured by a blown-out lens flare.
---
Exordium... obliterate!
---
There are some people who have disabilities that have made it very difficult to move fast enough to get the balls in time, no reason not to make it easier since that's pretty much the least important aspect of the mount progress
---
I mean, this is an exceedingly minor part of the game. It's not like they're changing raids or fractals.
---
Lets be real, there is always (you) and those tasteless fucks.
---
Very useful commentary
---
Why do you think you're entitled to join those groups?  
---
Would you also condone people getting false passports to enter a country if they "know" they would be an asset and highly valuable?  
---
A lot of people have an over-inflated sense of their own worth. It doesn't entitle you to fraudulently bypass requirements to gain access to a group that desires something specific.
---
Exactly why AEGIS should just be replaced in all instances with barrier.
---
Barrier can be tuned to give different amounts depending on the skill.
---
Is useful regardless of how hard the skill hits so it never feels wasted.
---
The base aegis applications of guard are pretty lackluster, outside of retreat and virtue of courage. They're typically only seen in *very* support-heavy builds.
---
I've been playing base guard for over a year and a half now (unscathed contender is your friend), and while it isn't the best at every fight, it definitely shines at a few. Most notably Gorseval, as you can avoid literally every attack, never have to dodge, and have the buff permanently.
---
And then there's me, sitting there with only two Aurillium infusions (because I can't afford more), pretty sure other players can't even see my subtle sparkles and gentle solar flares.  
---
Oh well.
---
You are so wrong it's unreal...
---
Some people have literal game breaking bugs and won't even be able to access the 'raid', and you want some elitest's to be allowed to wave their e-penis about, just because a new wing was released.  Get over yourself.
---
Those little sinks already exists and are not doing enough. Even doubling the numbers of those little sinks won't do anything. [Bolt of silk](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bolt_of_Silk) for instance is used in maybe 50 recipes needed in range of 3 to 20 (not counting ascended). Adding 50 more similar recipes won't do anything to stabilize this particular item since item creation for this item is way higher than twice the needed item. ie : faucet for this mat is way higher than the sinks. Ascended armor at the time it was added created a huge huge huge sink for that item (1200 per item for a light chest for instance). It was great at the time. Except ascended became trivial and sources of generating it multiplied (see OP). A complete set of ascended armor costed almost 3k bolt of silk. And it was before Hot. The game was 2 years old or something like that. Faucet for silk were ok at that time for those new sinks. We are now almost 7 years after release, and almost 2 years after PoF. We had 2 years of unids stuff faucet. No little sinks over a bigger demo could do anything, we are literally drowning in mats. Even by counting the number of generated silk per account par day on average and creating a equal sink, it won't change the stock of already created item since item destruction would just be equal to item generation. We need to have an item destruction&gt;item generation for removing millions of stock. Just with that objective in mind we are easily looking at on average 50 refined mat of all T5 (ancestral planks/mithril ingot/leather/silk) per account (strictly). But not every account will do that recipe each day (doesn't craft/don't care/don't play dail/boring/whatever). And one time thing will just be a "stock reset" before restock. And here OP's numbers are just mats listings from TP. We don't know the real state of things. If we could add bank and guild banks of regular players and of hoarders, maybe we should multiply those 20-30 millions by 10. I'm pretty sure there is a lot of players that have tons of them waiting for them to go up again. Like alt accounts with 100k or more (way more sometimes) bought stuff in the tp to collect. For instance wouldn't be that surprised if OP has an account with 100 millions of mats in the tp to collect :) and he's not alone.
---
Might be an unpopular opinion, but i wish auras were account bound.
---
I was really happy to get the moto little particle effect as a reward for doing the tribulation mode.
---
Then i see people with 5 ghostly infusion and now I feel is more about who can spend the most gold for them.
---
Open your achievement panel. Look for things that look challenging/interesting. Go for it.
---
Definitely join a guild. Having people to play with and common goals really helps if you're unable to set your own goals.
---
I literally said in another comment that the sole purpose of this charr is to bother people.
---
But your character is not what the top level comment is referring to. Yours actually has a theme. It's intentionally bad. It doesn't even break my immersion, you might ve just an eccentric adventurer.
---
What people despise are aura stackers who just by showing up reduce your high end 30 FPS (because lets be honest the game runs pretty shit) to 15 FPS. Like characters that are just a ball of lights and tectures. Fuck I hate that. The game is so beautiful and then this fucking light ball shows up. Yikes.
---
Tin cups taste worse.
---
Do you really think people stack polysaturating infusions and all the other awful shit because they think they look good? They are exactly the same as you, making it look awful on purpose (or just showing how rich they are). And every such smartass "oh it's supposed to look bad" is bringing down the game's whole aesthetic, the saturation of these visual eyesores reached enough critical mass to be a point of contention for people, enough to make countless reddit posts about it.
---
Sorry but no infusion aura looks good.
---
Theyre all gaudy and tacky
---
If yours doesn't you play a different game. You will never get above 45 FPS in Gw2. You are free to check.
---
Honestly I was expecting part of the point of the tiers was to see how fast we would complete the early ones, so they could balance later tiers to need more or less work as needed to get the event to go all week. I'm surprised they let it complete so fast.
---
And that is what we happen to call an opinion and you are certainly welcome to have one.
---
I salute your dedication to bad taste. Watching a one man carnival screaming by on a mount is hilarious.
---
I personally don't like them, but I don't see any issue with yours. They are ugly in my opinion (why would you remove the texture of your characters face? first pic), but not obnoxious.
---
The meta bonus box does not come from the Casino Blitz event. It comes from the Choya Piñata boss afterward.
---
Did you do this event chain?
---
1. [Help the Pact reach the Altar of Betrayal before their morale is depleted](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Help_the_Pact_reach_the_Altar_of_Betrayal_before_their_morale_is_depleted)

---
If you, did you defeat the final boss: [Risen Priest of Balthazar](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Risen_Priest_of_Balthazar)?
---
Does that all look familiar? If that is indeed the event chain and boss that you defeated, then perhaps you're doing not enough damage to count as participating? What class and build of that class are you playing?
---
there aren't even that many people who do this, and when i do come across them, it's not like i'm being forced to stare at them. i just notice 'em and look away. i know it's hard to understand the concept of solving your own problem, so take your time.
---
Thanks! I'll include this as soon as possible friend
---
I think that's the one. We escorted an NPC to the altar. I got gold participation so I think I did enough damage.
---
That's when i started hating her the most... she definitely doesn't grow on me.  In fact the opposite
---
Did you kill the boss I linked, the \[Risen Priest of Balthazar\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Risen\_Priest\_of\_Balthazar](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Risen_Priest_of_Balthazar)) , and did you get gold on the boss defeat as well?
---
That would be wonderful. At the moment I just set my character quantity level very low to avoid the eye cancer.
---
I made it specifically to bother the friend, he hates that he puts in a ton of work, and then I'm the one that gets the messages and compliments, all in all I think it's an approachable level of awful for the others who aren't in a call with me whenever I'm playing, I cater the gift giving and tone to be more pleasant rhan bothersome to folks who aren't outright rude, and I feel like this post is enough about me it warranted a comment. Seems like most folks here seem to represent the anti-"ugly" side, so giving a different perspective seemed like a good idea
---
Did you just assume i was a terrible person because i don't like taimi? Lol yikes
---
Most end game content is balanced for a group of 5 people, not solo.
---
That is not a good idea. The quality of the subreddit will decrease, or the amount of work you do to clean it up will increase, for the duration of the absence of the bug thread from the front page.
---
The bug thread is a critical component of the subreddit and should not be moved. If you must dislocate one of the pinned threads, it should be the weekly questions thread; but instead, you should just link to the raid kill thread in both pinned threads.
---
True
---
I saw a stunning norm in mistlock the other day. Cosmic was part of their name, and they used the galaxy infusion with the heavy cultural armour dyed white and gold with chaos weapon skins. It looked *amazing* maybe some might consider it generic but it came together really well. First time I’d seen an infusion used tastefully.
---
Agreed
---
I'm not sure, I couldn't see much with the amount of people there and it died so fast. I think that was the one, it was small like that one. I didn't think it was a boss at first. Yes, I got gold on it too.
---
If you like taimi that is cool with me dude.  Are you ok?
---
Big chain sounds like the Balth temple event.  If you ascended a bunch of steps, killed a risen priest then you did the temple meta.  If you did that then it may have bugged out on you. :/
---
Tbh I’d recommend doing the SW meta since it’s always going on.
---
Gotta commit to something lol
---
WooHoo.. thank you so much for this. Just finished collecting everything!!!! Thank you!!!
---
Yeah, people still do it.   Its not like it matters ultimately.  I don't see anyone taking WvW that seriously anymore.
---
Very strange. It definitely sounds like you did the right event and stayed long enough for sure. If you haven't gotten the tier rewards either, it sounds like you just didn't do enough damage to count as actually killing the Risen Priest of Balthazar, although your presence was enough to get credit for the meta event. What class and build were you playing, and what attacks/skills did you use on the Risen Priest, do you remember vaguely?
---
I find it funny that people (and groups) even waste their time spying for another server. A few weeks ago there was a spy for a guild group on an enemy server, all he did was call out where we were at... so the enemy group could run away. They were attacking the 3rd server, we wanted fights/bags and all they did was run :(. He wasn't a very good spy because he was repping their guild, and when called out about it he changed his tag right in front of us and said he wasn't with them.
---
I got a chest popup reward after the boss was killed, so I'm certain I did enough for it. I'm a reaper, so I spinned to win. Should have hit everything in the area.
---
Sales happen but rarely. I think there's only been 3 or 4 *ever* for Season 2.
---
Buy them as you get to them instead of all at once in case a sale does crop up.
---
Yes,  there are sales that bundle the LS into a bundle for 2 and one for 3.   Just wait for a sale.
---
Now just imagine how much easier it was when every map was full of people working on the same achievement :)
---
If you took that seriously I'm not sure what to say. lol
---
Yes, that's fine, people are just pointing out that you seem unable to understand why anyone *else* might feel differently. If legendaries mean nothing to you, then don't get one. If you're worried about time or cost efficiency, just buy one. Do whatever suits you. (And I'm not sure if you realize this or not, but your opinion isn't exactly new here. People who ask about legendaries on Reddit are frequently told that it's cheaper to just buy the ones that can be bought.)
---
Yea. Taimi is hands down my favorite character. I love everything about her.  I can see why people might get annoyed though..too my when I hear that communicator beep I get all happy to get a new report.
---
Can we please get a sub for guild wars 2 shitposts.....
---
Shhhhh shhhhh shh.. it's ok.  You amoung friends here.  I have this happen a lot, more often in the past few years than I would like.  I've done a few different things each time.  I pick a crazy end goal and then break it down into chunks to work on it.
---
Like one time I decided to craft 20 legendary weapons.  So I broke that out into pieces.  Or when I filled out my material storage of all cloth, leather, ores, wood and t1 to t6 materials.
---
  Right now I'm in the same place, so I will suggest the three things I'm doing.
---
I'm joining small guilds for a week or two at a time and helping them level, get their hall in order as best I can.  Donating some resources along the way.  Using my experience in the game to teach new players and give them that nudge they sometimes need.
---
I'm sticking up on material storagable food resources, with a goal of capping everything out at 2k.
---
Building up my karma,  obby shards and spirit shards from farming SW.  The money is nice too.
---
For you I would like to switch things up.
---
1. Talk with guilds that are recruiting and say you would like to join for a while learn more about them and get to know them (maybe turn it into an interview of them so people can "meet" the guilds they see in metas, you know get the community a bit more than just a passive hello).
---
2.  Learn different builds for your primary class, switching up your play style may challenge you a bit. 
---
3.  Learn RIBA in SW and see about one day trying to command it.  It's fairly easy, lots of old commanders from chest trains and RIBA are still there.  Leading people can bring out traits in you that you never knew you had. (Not always good BUT knowing them helps you deal with it and that can be quite rewarding).
---
OP best of luck to you.  Might see you around in game and hopefully you'll be telling people of something fun you did.
---
Did you log in with the character you made the events with? For some reason i only get the special meta event reward with the character i made it with. So if i log on another character i wont get the chest until i log in on the right character.
---
You could also farm gold and exchange to gems and buy the seasons that way. Seasons you buy from the gem store so it is possible to get them without using real money.
---
Try it from Tasmania. I can play most arcade games. I'm an avid gamer all my life. I do quite well at them. I can do any jumping puzzle in the game. But at times. there are things in this game that are horrid for people in the Oceanic Region due to the distance it takes for the signal to reach from here to there. THere was a period of time when people from Australia were no longer able to complete Sanctum Sprint for example. Either it couldn't be done or you had to get very very lucky. The lightning pull would overshoot you by a huge margin.
---
For me, I got it done but it took like a hundred tries. There were many times I was in the circle on my screen, well in the circle, but still didn't catch the ball, because the local game was showing where it thought I was, but where you really on on the server is not reflected.
---
I play with my wife side by side. If we run together, on her screen it looks like she's way ahead and on my screen it looks like I'm way ahead. They both  can't be right. lol
---
Just put it in one of your shared inventory slots, yo.
---
would buy gems to get a nice tanktop/t-shirt and trousers/pants for heavy female. like holy shit its all bulky disgusting things and the only decent looking ones if you're going for lighter theme are aether/phalanx and arah dung.. damn life is hard as a heavy class main if you dont want to look like a bulky warrior.
---
And even though he has been making his money off of betting you survive you will need to pay top dollar for everything there
---
One of - if not the - most powerful boon ingame is disappointing? Well ether you heavily underestimate the potential of this boon because you are absolutely new to this game or you are such a veteran (in gaming general) that you will most likely not find a single game mechanic that will impress you.
