What we really need is an NPC (like the dodge roll one with the chest as a reward) in early zones that clearly tells you to use hard/soft CCs to break the bar. It's literally that easy. Make the NPC list all types of CC and to "check your skill description if it has one of the CCs then attack"... new players aren't idiots, they'll learn if there was a proper tutorial in place.

This comment reads like one from early Reddit, or imgur itself
---
That's vague.... ಠ_ಠ
---
you can only use the mentor tag while you are in a party or solo. If you use the LFG you automatically create a 10 man squad(there are some exeptions) without a commander. then you loose the mentor tag.
---
Sure why not, if you can drink bath water you can also drink black tar.
---
Bring the devs cupcakes, anet devs are sickers for cupcakes
---
I love how much the pve raid community whines even tho they get way more content than pvp+wvw combined. 
---

---
Bring on the hate.
---
Me as well... I want more sexy furrys!
---
Yeah... no. People have no idea what the difference is between a 300 and 100kp group. They just think that if you wipe 0 times you did good while this isnt true at all. There are many mechanics that you only learn by playing the content a lot. I thought the same thing back then until I got higher kp and joined speedclear groups. Its a world of difference in high kp
---
Hehe, anet worded that one quite wrong in their bug fix. It was a 5% dmg increase on a strike on a 3s ICD, which adds up to less than 100 dps in the end, so basically all numbers are still reachable, since noone had the motivation to redo it we just didn't since it was so insignificant
---
Yeah exactly this ^
---
For Condi Chrono and Mirage I just list the confusion stacks you should aim for. Actually, the same goes for Condi Boon Chrono too.
---
Thats not how it works. You cant say or ping smt more than 3 times in certain thats. This rule doesnt count for party and squad chat
---
That doesn’t factor in the fact that the raid took 9+ months to release and there haven’t been any meaningful updates to pvp/WvW outside of the warclaw in ages.  Sure, they’ve released a fair amount of content lately, but at the same time it’s mostly content that applies/appeals to one demographic that plays this game and that’s about it. It’s not that varied, it’s not high end content, and frankly it’s killing the game for people that want to take it seriously or have a challenge and not just run around pressing F collecting 50 Skyscale eggs all over dragonstand etc. etc.
---
Dont have to be good at pvp
---
for the pvp dailys, just do one game, go healer get top stat heal and then choose the easiest of the pve dailys (most of the time vista) in case you dont win.
---
It's not just fatigue. It's basic lack of support for the content I like to play. I could not care less about living story, and that is where the majority of resources goes. I haven't even finished the pof story on any of my accounts and I don't intend to. Handwaving this as fatigue misses why a lot of players are upset with the direction of the game - its because of anets priorities and doubling down on a resource intensive model that creates bite sized single player content.
---
Im lvl 57 warr. When i get to lvl80 im going to play dungeons and complete low lvl areas with new players in my cool armor that i just bought from AH...
---
True. I just run scourge, get top heals, top damage, and top kills, and get the daily win and boom they're all done. I usually do all the other dailies too though
---
It's for convenience. Also not many people have a permanent upgrade extractor and permanent bank contract.
---
I play full Harrier ‘s Boon Support Druid in Fractals, BoonZerker SoulBeast in PvE, Modded “no sick’em” build in PvP. I have yet to raid which I will probably play Harrier Druid or power SB. 
---
I honestly have no idea for WvW. Can only think some kinda of Druid since stance share ranger is a joke till they make it 600 range(just like commands) and 10 man like spirits. Or possibly 5 man with next attack against you to miss for like aegis or something because something needs to give Guardian any kind of aegis competition in all modes and ranger some more way into groups besides meh dps or spiceless and nerfed healing druid. 
---
imho, condi is a joke on anything ranger in any form of PvP or WvW. Other classes do it better and with engineers and diamond skin Eles-it’s just not worth it.
---
Ok, thanks. I wish there was some warning or something about this... my bad though.
---
Is it fine to transmute the refined envoy pieces? Will they still work in the mystic forge?
---
The bloodstone ones sure, albeit limited to back, ring, and amulet, the mist gear takes a full stack of either shards of glory (1.35g) or memories of battle (13-17g) to reset them though.
---
The ability to upgrade the fractal purchased ascended armor into legendary despite having similar cost/purchase structure as PvP/WvW.
---
I agree with you but man, this talk is way over my pay-grade.  2600 gold for a permanent upgrade extractor?  Sick, lemme just go get that real quick /s.
---
I don't know why people keep saying this. GW1 was a game where if you didn't run a cookie cutter build you had to play alone and hope your AI companions were good enough because you would never, *ever* get a group.
---
The massive amount of skills and multiclassing led to the *exact same problem* that this thread is complaining about GW2 having, where 99% of the builds were complete trash.
---
Interesting observation that ANet's corporate culture predates Youtube, Twitter, and Twitch, and how/why they haven't effectively leveraged those platforms to enhance GW2's community: Engaging with the communities there [risk losing control of the narrative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G2yPHNdMec&amp;t=13m15s), and to counter that, "you have to out-snark the Twitter trolls, you have to out-meme the memers on Twitch, and on Youtube you have to cultivate an audience big enough to drown out the fascists. ANet doesn't have the will to do this, ... and are costing themselves tremendous exposure."
---
Fuck...
---
Is this the new top gun trailer I keep hearing about
---
Man... I wish I engineers had heavy armor
---
While I get what you mean about convenience.  Spending 500 gold for it is about the same convenience as a person gets from buying 365 pairs of socks so they don't have to wash socks anymore.  So yeah, convenient!
---
[removed]
---
you'd rather ppl didnt know? :p
---
gw2 forums? this is still a thing?
---
Nah, they don't have mercy or monk runes there
---
this tbh
---
i can definitely see this being EXTREMELY convenient for rebreathers.
---
instead of obtaining multiple rebreathers for each of my builds, i can consolidate all rebreathers to just two: one for power, and one for condi.
---
did i play 20000 hours in the same gw1 as you did?
---
That's about $100. I'm sure you can figure out a way to make an EXTRA $100
---
You don't rely on combo fields and you don't rely on self buffs. There's no reliance on self buffs because they just exist. You can cut margins as a result for fury if you really wanted to was the point but you don't need to as the fury generation is full on covered. I assure you the net benefit for running a might heal tempest is not with as scary a margin as you may be thinking and I also assure you that combo fields are not as bad as you're considering.
---
&gt; raids
---
&gt; much harder than fractals
---
excuse me what
---
the only hard thing in raids is getting 10 ppl to not cause a wipe by doing sth stupid

---
Chrono + druid are rooted in pug meta due to inertia but realistically 2 quickbrands 1 heal renegade, and 1 damage oriented might source (ie: str rune PS herald) not only provides full 10 man AP, quickness and alacrity in spades and also brings massively amounts more damage.
---
Not unless I start selling stuff I own I guess.
---
This was /sarcasm.
---
It's baffling to me that they punished holosmith this much.
---
Holo (and engineer in generally really) is a super selfish profession. You'd think that the selfish dps spec would be higher than other dps specs that also provide a level of support.
---
If you just do dailies you get something like 20-30g per run depending on attunement level. If you have a proper CM group, a run can be anywhere from 20-40 mins, so its a pretty good rate for something that isnt mind numbing.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/
---
I'm pretty sure you can just buy from any EU site that gives a digital code.
---
Let me get in on this.
---
*For Maguuma so loved WvW, that she gave her only begotten Xushin, that whosoever squads with him shall not perish, but have everlasting Karma Trains.*
---
My guess: I think it’s more that you called it a leak and people want to hear about content in game.  Browsers of /new probably are not really caring about rando merchandise at the moment.
---
Well, buying both permanent contracts are about 6600 gold. That's way more gold *and* then you still need tons of armors and weapons to cover all possible stats (x3 because 3 armor types) and you need to have all sigils and runes *only* to get the same functionality you get with legendary stuff. 
---
Even if you talk about legendary runes+sigils only, you still need every rune and sigils several times to get the same functionality. So in the end you spend way more gold and bank space to get the same functionality in a less convinient way.
---
+ 4000 gold for the permanent bank access. :)
---
Pretty sure you can just craft the envoy armor.
---
&gt; It's for convenience.
---
Yes, just like legendary armor. Have fun changing every single rune with multiple clicks and scrolling while having 2 separate sets would only be 6 quick clicks instead. (Unless of course they add build templates)
---
At the very least let me craft Ad Infinitum more than once...  I don’t want to craft 6 more warbringer but I’m working on it without another option, Anet.
---
Sure sure...
---
yes yes, im the reason the games "shit", i get your invested, i get your upset, but your literally breaking down responses and going full blown rant, take step back and just ask if all this is worth it, your passionate about the game, great! wont mean shit long term, complain, rant, fight it, gw2 is what gw2 is, they wont commit to anyone area hardcore outside of living world story, tho if they do more raids or dungeons between, great......you'll still be here complaining about something else, just have fun with the game, dont put yourself through so much stress, content will come as it always has
---
I hate to break it to you but it's not required for vision. I completed vision and havent done this achievement yet.
---
I've been summoned. Thanks OP for reminder, I missed last survey.
---
My 2 cents are added.
---
I mean I have been following the page for years and I haven't seen a single leak not happen.
---
The problem is armor breakage. Sure you can die a zillion times and get it done. But then some people don't like to be fighting naked, because you die faster each time. Same with death penalty. If you get max death penalty you die instantly without getting downed. A lot of people give up before they beat it, because that discourages them.
---
To be honest, I didn't have a problem with that fight at all, but I know people who did.  I can't tell you how many times I carried people through that instance. Getting through something in the worst way possible is a turn off to a bunch of people.
---
Have you actually played with this comp? In my experience it is better to run the hybrid comp with chrono, quickbrand, diviners ren, and might tempest. Without chrono many of the higher damage pressure fights become extremely difficult execution wise like xera, and vg, while fights that rely on multiple pulls like sab and sloth also require the multi directional pull that focus on chrono provides.
---
Well yeah, and your reaction to this reaction is sort of SurprisedPikachu.jpg
---
Everyone should chill they're just collectibles lol
---
*Goes into comments not knowing what to expect, except maybe concerns about OP's identity.*
---
*Finds not just one but FIVE devs popping in to say hi.*
---
Now this is some quality innocent community interaction. :)
---
My fortune teller were always right, too. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
"Unfortunately, the issue is so common that the knowledge of this being the case is also common."
---
It is though, to get heavy corsair boot for visions of dragonfall for vision 1: awakening. You might have cheese it out with reward tracks from pvp or wvw? Or there is another way of obtaining the boot that i didnt know of. Cause war eternal mastery achievments include this achievement and theres no other "extra" achievement i could replace it with like other maps.
---
Casuals. Thats how.
---
Welcome to reddit.  You're safe to have discussions here.
---
&gt; Now if my group ask mid-fight to change from dps to support then this game/players have lost all sense of reality and some times I think they have.
---
Not mid fight, but it's pretty common (at least in my raid groups) to switch around chars for certain bosses or after with the time. And it's always is a big time loss, if someone need to gather around his gear from his other chars.
---
Well some bosses that mirage excel in have mechanics that you shouldn't be reflecting as part of your rotation such as cairn or matthias so I don't expect cWeavers to be that popular on those bosses in pugs.
---
I already can cross out some of the classes I don't wanna play - pretty much the only ones I think that would interest me are Ele, Guard, Ranger, or Thief. So I'm tryin' to think real hard about what I wanna focus on, because... I don't do alts well, lol
---
Yeah the main reason I didn’t like him was because I had the great idea of taking my bunkering druid the first time. 
---
Not a great experience with an already boring boss. Killed it eventually but my god that took forever.
---
Gold from fractals mainly comes from getting lucky with drops. There’s not really a method to getting the “good drops”, just luck. The answer to this will differ depending on who you ask. 
---
Although for me personally, on an average run with no notable drops, I get anywheres from 10 to 15 ish gold per run.
---
Honestly I just want more skins(glider,mount etc) to work towards ingame that isn’t gemstore.
---
Bet you see a lot less lights than the last guy used to
---
I can personally say that in the many 200 kp groups I've pugged, not once has anyone stood out to me as having exceptional damage. Most of the time the weavers would deal less damage than me, the warriors dealt literally atrocious damage, the cc was slow like usual, and everything felt generally the same as usual-- mediocre at best.
---
Pugging = shit compared to with statics, no matter what way you slice it. You may not believe me at all but I faked kp up to 101 kp legit and I am not exaggerating that it was extremely rare for anyone else that came for damage dealt higher than me, and I exclusively played on dgh for every single run. Pretty sure in fact, the only two other guard players who ever dealt higher than me in pugs were people with fractal god/goddess titles and had krait slaying+impact sigils for 99 cm when I only had krait+force.
---
The reason why I generally avoid map chat is that you're only going to get a guild that happens to be in map chat at the same time. I'm a bit picky when it comes to what guild I join, because I feel that it's an important choice for my enjoyment of the game. Taking my time perusing guild posting gives me a better chance of finding a good fit.
---
Would kick you for sure if you pinged backpack xD
---
Shows you are incompetent to think that a silly backpack shows skill.
---
Fake kp if you actually good enough.
---
If you do full clears weekly you will be fine! :D
---
Tbh never saw someone pinging ad infinitum and also would find it pretty stupid. Like yea, you run a lot of fractals, but that doesnt mean you know what to do in 100cm. Its just like all these people posting dhuum kp's for Wings that arent W5 ... just why? ._.
---
I saw that video before, but a typical pug could be reflecting its projectile within its hitbox so i expect lots of confusion when that happens.
---
Did not think of that. Good point  :)
---
Now those changes are ones I strongly upvote! Bring on the Karka crab BBQ!!!
---
Agreed. It would be a nice touch, but given how important it is to read enemy animations in PvP, it's to keep things cleaner visually. There's a big difference in how you need to respond to a Headshot or Black Powder and an auto-attack.
---
Because it's a single weapon skill. Also, what would happen when you use p/d?
---
I still don't get how it's stupid? I'm literally saying I'm new, I know the fractal, but just need to try it, here's proof I play a lot and do a ton of fractals, yet I can't find a group to learn.
---
So all I can see is elitism, where I basically get told to screw off despite me not even getting a chance &gt;_&gt;
---
It's probably because not having it expire ever would be buggy. I don't know of any buff that doesn't expire that isn't tied to an achievement or instance.
---
I k ow humans got love in PoF,but I’m still waiting on more good canthan options. There really isn’t much to work with there that isn’t babyface esque.
---
T4s + recs usually is 10-15g per day, more if you sell everything and get lucky with rings + salvaging, and I'd say around an hour for all 6.
---
Yeah that's not a very solid argument, it's like saying mirages can't be recommended because brainlets may equip feedback.
---
change setting to full screen and back to windowed. sometimes it just gets stuck on stupid
---
Did you try setting the right resolution at full screen? 
---
Otherwise just drag the lower edge of the screen until you fill your monitor.
---
My dude I am so desperate for long sylvari hair, I always wanted a style like that for my necro.
---
and not to mention they made the account unlocks from GW1 reward you in GW2 with the hall of monuments. Honestly, the HoM is the only thing keeping the GW1 economy alive.
---
Killing Proof
---
I just went to check because what you're describing definitely sounds right, and it is. But I somehow finished Vision I without unlocking the boots? The collection says I have them, but the skin is not in my wardrobe. Maybe its some kind of bug, I'll report it and see what happens.
---
I wish this was the discourse we were having with all of the veteran drama going on lately.  
---
I'm personally taking a break from the game because thief pvp/wvw builds are feeling stale to me, but I know I'll be back. I don't need to make a pissy rant on the forums or reddit ripping on the devs for how I feel about the game. I'm just going to leave, and come back later. I've dumped hundreds upon hundreds of dollars into supporting the company so I could be very angry if I wanted; I'm just not. That's my choice.
---
I love you

Maybe not for you or for me but we are not the only ones.

What happened?

THAT guy from the local comic store, on Halloween
---
Jokes aside, fab!
---
Hi, I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7sf3a8/data_daily_income_from_running_t4_fractals/) on this a while back. Not too much has changed since then, except mat prices of course. Now, I'd estimate the return is slightly higher (closer to ~20g) for a full clear which can be done in 45 mins. CMs add even higher rewards on top of that, but require a more experienced group.
---
Yes, static runs it all the time. Renegade tanks on fights that require tanking (with some exceptions where I as quickness firebrand just slip on a toughness infusion or two).
---
Focus pull is a very good skill but it's not the be all end all. Our players are strong enough to make all the pulls even if they're directional and renegade heals vomits healing in way higher amounts than druid to cover all of that.
---
Focus pull is strong but if your group or quickbrands are good they can easily cover any pulls necessary.
---
just giving a command without a reason doesn't come off well, especially when it's in a targeted whisper. When its just in say chat or map chat not singling anyone out, its possible more might get the hint. But i suppose only about half or less of the pop actually read chat so... that's another problem.
---
Most use of swapping gear is in fractals/ dungeons. You can buff yourself with a high boon duration set, swap to a dmg set and after the fight swap to a running set. you could do the same thing in open-world.
---
You can definitely gain a lot from pre buffing. The longer the fight takes the lower the impact tho. 
---
I sometimes use it in wvw, swap my gear from power to condi on the go, but that has really low value and you run the risk of being stuck on a weapon you do not want.
---
&gt;
---
If you really want to get into a group (and you know the content but don't have enough kp) just fake ping it.
---
There are probably groups you will get into trying that (depending on how much kps they search) but I think its a really stupid advise to give.
---
I cant speak for everyone but when I do Fractals with some guildies I mostly search for around 100kp+ and demand that they spam ping it everytime, if its obvious that they fake I kick and block them. On the other side if they come in and say something along the lines "hey, just have "x amount" can I join, I always let them join. Im probably on minority of people thinking like that, but if someone ist friendly and honest, he will have 100% more chances to get into my group than if he would try faking kps or making some bullshit up.
---
If you dont have any kp's at all and dont got guildies/friends/ any static to get into 100cm I would suggest joinen low amount kp groups like 10 or 20 maybe and ask nicely adding you know the mechanics. They wont let you stay in every group for sure, but not all fractal players are assholes! ;)
---
Killproofs are an indicator that you probably know what to do because killed the boss before but not a 100% proof. I had someone in my group before with 13kp's and one time also someone without any kp. Both of these people (we even needed to explain the mechanics to the 0kp dude because he didnt know them) played a lot better than some people with 100+ kp.
---
Wouldn't say 100cm is like an afk golem, there are many mechanics you need to be aware of and be able to manage them. I think its probably the fractal with the highest learning curve.
---
Now doing it more or less daily since it came out, shattered observatory on normal mode in any fractal tier seems like a complete joke, but I still remember when it came out depending on the instabilities me and my guildies often only did that fractal on tier 3 and even then barely managed to complete it.
---
Logging in daily may be enough to meet an activity threshold, regardless of time spent in game.
---
I checked all of the boxes too
---
What is there to do besides dungeons and trials? For PvE.
---
You can achieve nearly 100% slow uptime between a chrono and a renegade using shortbow.
---
Also, if someone consider ascended drops to be a part of income, this rise up by a lot in long run. 2-5 chests a week is an average, and converting it to craft price is a nice sum.
---
Also as you mentioned, selling stuff. Ascended materials drops and occasional mystic coins are great.
---
I hear ya, I play holo too!
---
&gt; 2-5 chests a week is an average
---
what? per month maybe ye
---
Oh god yes. 
---
Somehow I believe that they are going to do it after they release full set.
---
They have a really overzealous mod team on the forum.
---
this was the issue, for some reason it wasn't detecting my monitor was a 1920x1200. After a bunch of resets it just worked again...
---
&gt;The only exception is when drastic changes happen to a class, 
---
Which is the case with condi weaver. Rather than having misleading information, I would totally blank it out.
---
But I guess they don't really care anymore.
---
its pretty good. I'm guessing you're going with  the basic gear you have. There is a pants leg that has the gun strap or band on the upper thigh And i believe there's a more similar shoulder choice ingame. What that picture from? makes me wanna go ingame an cosplay this toon :D

God forbid you even mention the name of a server on the official forum.  The entire thread will get locked because suddenly it's a "matchup thread".  Imagine not even letting your fans talk about your game on your own forum.
---
Thanks :D
---
BOMBA!
---
I completely agree with this. I have something like 600 hours of game time and I feel like I haven’t even scratched the surface of what the game has to offer. There are still so many achievements for me to finish and those achievements lead me to events and areas that I probably would never have seen otherwise. Just the other day, I found out about the bloodstone rift stabilizer device from Fields of Ruin. There’s no achievement attached to it, but eventually your device can unlock several different teleport locations. Little stuff like that is what I love about the game.
---
The best time will be July 28th, 2.41 PDT. Wait and see
---
At what times are you usually doing fractals?
---
My Acc name is Marius.5219 if you see me online you can whisper me so I can add you back. Could invite for an some Fractal runs on the next days if you want to. ^^
---
I would think something like the dodge chests should be very easy to do. CC to access the chest. Teaches the principal with a quick low level reward.
---
power diving is fun!   :D  wish more of my guildies could do it :D
---
Wait, why frost trap instead of vulture stance for power soulbeast? Was there some change to either skill or a trait that I'm missing here?
---
It is their chat so it is their rules. Don't chat there if you don't like it.
---
This was exactly my malfunction! I powered through, but this was the most difficult experience I had in story mode - before and since.
---
They can't add dividers at flat number spots because of scaling
---
Yeah, ah well one thing i learned is that its good to do all collections beforehand so in case its needed in the future itll already be unlocked like yours did
---
Does death of the Author apply when I'm talking right back to you?  I'm skipping your first three paragraphs for sanity's sake. 
---
Honestly, only two or three are that constantly engaging.  Warframe's one (although you could make the argument that they're constantly stretching out the endgame) and there's a very old Korean lobby game that's constantly engaging and fun.  It's a very difficult thing to do.
---
Yes you're absolutely right, and I don't play with pugs that much anymore. Although occasionally you find a few people in my situation through the lfg tool
---
No, but I do remember this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhswFPk7JlQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhswFPk7JlQ)
---
Ah that's right, you think I would remember this with the amount of chrono I play and being the one that updated the wiki...
---
Thanks for pointing it out though
---
Path of Fire would be the better option if you can't get both.
---
Main reason being that the new story - living world season 5 - will be locked behind it.
---
You also get mounts which will make it easier and less tedious to travel around the world.
---
If you end up getting PoF you can join someone else for the first story mission to unlock the mount - so save your level 80 boost until you know what you want to play.
---
Except that posting memes and emotes aren't against their rules actually.
---
Their official rules are these:
---
&gt;* Be respectful and courteous to ALL participants, be they ArenaNet staff and developers, community livestreamers, and/or your fellow viewers and chat participants.
---
* Any type of hate speech or hateful speech, such as sexist, racist, homophobic, or transphobic speech, is not allowed.
---
Failure to follow these rules may result in you being timed out or permanently banned from chat.
---
&gt; you can play for fun
---
But that's it. Games should be fun first, they are not your jobs where you have to show results.
---
Fun is subjective.
---
Yes, this actually makes sense.
---
There is just one thing that could be considered - I have consistently spent $ in gemstore, except for the last few months. You’d think they would be interested in how to keep me going, but I guess not :|
---
Arc dps has build templates that auto swap legendary stats. I assume they will make a similar update with this.
---
Mirage should have been brought down instead of bringing other builds like weaver in the 38-40k range.
---
Some bosses especially in fractals need a health boost to keep up with the power creep. Phases lasting 4sec in t4 are nice and all but is that really balanced?
---
The bs warr has even higher dps than some full dps builds now.
---
Bringing all builds down might be harder than just buffing hp by a flat amount and buffing engi and necro. Willdestroy pvp balance again though.
---
They could also remove the cap from fractal levels and give a reward based on the highest completed scale on a rotating fractal. Could make it weekly to not kill the t4 daily groups.
---
Most fights in raids are just too short with a decent team and fractal bosses are just a joke.
---
Dude, that's some pretty brutal skill.
---
Not familiar with it, what animation cancelling?
---
Same here. Also I love the fact that I can just skip days or play something else when I'm not in a mood of playing gw2, then come back and play, no sub needed, nothing forces me to play.
---
After those 7 years what makes me playing is exploring new builds, classes, new compositions. Wnenever I stack up with enough ascended pieces, I make another hero, another build. Once a time I open achievements windows and look on what I would like to do now. Currently I decided to make all specialisation weapons collections and then all dungeons paths with classes/builds I never played.
---
In meantime I slowly craft leges just by doing metas and fractals, never grinding, with no stress that I'll be falling behind.
---
\+1 this man, give him a dev job!
---
So don't craft them?
---
So I guess this is the new trend? Bunch of ¨GW2 lacks this and should be this¨ or ¨I love GW2 but...¨
---
That's still a good week. I get maybe 1 in 4 weeks. :(
---
Elite specs. Hero points were locked behind masteries, and you needed double the amount of hero points to fully unlock the elite spec. Funny how everyone forgot that, when it was by far the biggest complaint. Anet made it seem like we'd be able to play HoT *with* our elite specs, but this was impossible. Typical communication problems which Anet is known for.
---
dafuq did i just watch?
---
New California Republic scout as far as I can remeber
---
Np, there are still new players for this great 7 year old game :)
---
put ceddit/r/guildwars2 in your address bar and wait 20 seconds, you will see how "moderated" reddit is too. quite a bit of the removed posts are warranted tho
---
TFW you see a New Zealand food on r/gw2. not complaining :D
---
And even if you say "this is gem store" vs "this is ingame", they don't have a category that is exclusively ingame plus you don't pick the most obvious and easily visible ones, simply because that then overshadows **all** the ingame reward categories in visual fx.
---
For example, selling alternative **animations** exclusively in the gem store would be fine, because changed animations during combat/etc wouldn't be at all visible when just idling in a city. While exclusive and super-rare mounts would be, showcasing ingame performance and dedication, something the more time-invested players desire. But changed animations could be **super** flourishing, in turn giving those who want to pay for extra bling something everyone will notice, just not constantly.
---
I would say that GW2 is actually a game that feels like a job, contrary to popular "argument" from certain type of people. GW2 is designed with many arbitrary timegates, most of which focus on daily and weekly reset. Last most hated addition was skyscale "quest". Such design forces you to log in every day and do activities you may wish to do the other day. But you can't, because game is designed as a job - to make you do things the way devs want you to do, not the way you like or when you have time for it.
---
So yeah, current "casual" design of gw2 is actually more like a job.
---
After reading this post and the replies I am really surprised how many people seem to have struggled during this fight. For me it was easy as hell, just like all story content. But even my gf, who plays a full zerker staff dps tempest and is skill clicking, made it without dying once. And that was on release day, so pre nerf.
---
RIP Veteran Spiders. I actually enjoyed grinding them with my group.
---
I don't think it was "too grindy" per se, it was just too much grind added in a game that had basically no grind before. People got culture shocked.
---
I think the real value of legendary gear (every legendary gear; armor, weapons, trinkets, runes, sigils) comes with build templates. It all falls into place with it, but without it, it's the convenience of not having inventory clutter at the price of more clicks. I don't mind the clicks, but I can't wait for the official build template solution to try out new stuff without a hassle.
---
As with every legendary gear: you don't have to get it if you think there are easier / better ways.
---
i think he meant to say in the last forever rather than days.
---
yes....YES nostalgia
---
Random question: Is it impossible for f2p to attuning ascended gear?
---
Caesars Legion sucked, I've always been stuck with NCR. Armor is nice, the third option is the best imo.
---
&gt; You can just put your backpack in a shared inventory slot and cycle between characters.
---
Yeah... that would be the worst option to handle it.
---
Sorry bud, some of us aren't that invested into the game anymore, it would be a huge hassle to write these up still.
---
Sub doesnt mean you HAVE to play each day several hours. In my country a subfee is worth about 1.5 cinema visits with everything... so around 4-5 hours of entertainment. If you drop below that, then renewing your sub is probably not a good idea.
---
Also, the "falling behind" is only a thing in asian mmos, and even there you can catch up via MTX fast enough. Take WoW for example, if you fall behind there you buy the new expac and get back into it, and thanks to the added levels the older content you missed is in pretty much easy mode.
---
Im sorry, but mmos have a quite higher developement cost compared to EAs liveservice, so not wanting to spend any money except box price is utopic. Then you should play a singleplayer or multiplayer rpg, not a mmo.
---
The difficulty spike basically only exists for the healer since there's the energy management but it's just another resource management system like druid CA; I'm not calling ren healing easy but when you vomit as much healing and have the ridiculous healing modifier renegades have you could probably sit in Kalla auto attacking and pressing F4 on CD and still out heal a druid without using tablet skills. QB is significantly easier than chrono ever was. It's only difficulty there comes from the axe pulls.
---
"Why would you not" would be if you're literally creating your own raid and pugging every thing. If you are, RIP you; you should probably make some raider friends in game. Because all you need need is a trio of 2QB 1Ren and you can pug the other slots easily.
---
Maguuma gift is faster because:
---
- Mapping the 4 maps is easier because there are no hearts to complete.
---
- Crystalline Ore is easy to farm now, funerary incense on the contrary is not, even with the changes made to make it easier.
---
Grind = "repetitive and uninteresting gameplay", the first three skyscale collections are running around the same map 3 times and pressing interact. Repetitive -&gt; check, uninteresting -&gt; hell yes.
---
Power tempest! It uses shatterstone in its rotation :-)
---
Gold per hour for fractals is tough to say. Groups that are very organized can clear fractals crazy fast so the gph goes way up for them but they arnt getting any more gold than a group that does the same fractals but take twice the time. T4's should never take longer than 30min for all 3, same thing for both cms and recs. Ideally and I dare say normally everything goes much faster than 30min for each set of T4s, recs, cms. It all comes down to the groups and players.
---
Rough numbers here. T4s+recs is 10-15g from encryptions (trophy items) + other drops, so things like agony infusions (+1,3,6,9 etc), ascended box/mats, T5mats, any rares/green/blues/exotics that dropped + champ boxes (open them on the lvl 80 or on a bag opener). It all adds up and I havnt done the work to figure out how much all the extra stuff is worth every day. I think fractals are always worth doing the T4s, the recs if you have the time or need the relics for stuff. Once you get into the CM's it becomes even more worth your while as CM players take the game a little more seriously so there will be less problems or wipes and if there are they will more likely fix things and communicate with each other instead of just leaving to find a new group. Plus all the extra drops you get from CMs.
---
Yep, that's what it means. And when you have to kill the same mobs over and over again to level in a game for hours on end, that's a grind. A definitive collection that has 60 items in it, which are just interacts? Not a grind by any standard I know. You know I've read dozens of dozens of complaints about that collection. I can't recall anyone complaining that that was a grind.  If you had to kill 60 things to level, no one would call that a grind. And getting sixty things for a collection, not a grind either. You may find it boring. You may not like it. But it's not a grind by any standard I've ever heard.
---
Brings back memories, GW1 was IMHO more unique game and had better PvP. GW2 is more standard MMO. 
---
also good one

I don't play much anymore, but saw Scrapper got changes. After a quick lookover, guess it's not a great time to come back as a Scrapper main, huh?
---
good good and good. did I mention good?
---
since i didnt player last year, i thought mirage got nerfed, glad to hear that its still playable.
---
You say that like it's a problem.
---
It's really not the healing output that's important, it's the method by which it's delivered. Druid has much more flexibility when healing, and more than enough healing output for every scenario. Good squads don't even need 2 healers, one druid is ample.
---
Those are some shitty assumptions to make. You're out of touch with reality. I run my own raid progression group, and I play with a a different full clear group. In total I raid 5 times a week. The only time we run Ren is in combination with boon thief. I've played and experimented with FB/Ren but it's just a bootleg support comp. for people who're way too hard for renegade.
---
Pog
---
I think the shoulders are your main problem... They cover most of the armor (is it Light armor?), and the feather cloak look doesn't really fit the Canthan aesthetic.
---
If it is Light armor, try the Masquerade shoulders, for instance. This give a Pagoda shoulders vibe, that fits nicely with Asian inspired themes.
---
Despite being both a raider and an avid LS player, I would GLADLY farm any content that gives me access to legendary trinkets without that butt ugly aura...
---
&gt; as you're regularly one fatfingered key or distraction away from disaster.
---
Welcome to the same boat rifle Daredevil has been in for ages, I guess
---
Oldie here: i wanted to get back into gw2. The last time i played, personal gliders were the new thing. Im mainly interested in wvw/pvp mesmer and maybe a little guardian. Ive finished the base story mode but not heart of thorns story. what do i need to prioritize doing when i hop back in?
---
What DPS spec isn't selfish, though? Thief has been argumented for years to be "the" selfish DPS class, but from how I see it, this goes for pretty much any of the classes that spec with their maximum DPS options
---
Came to write this. Thanks for doing it for me
---
Beautiful and skilled like always. ^___^
---
I gave a thought about how I would design this and all I could come up with was the runes, arranged one next to the other so you can see the graphic and on hover you would get to see the stats. So you are right with the hover mechanic.
---
This would use little real estate on the screen, you can pick the runes fast if you know exactly what you want, either by position or by graphic, while allowing for people who don't know what they need to hover and look at the stats.
---
So having found am even better way, I think that the new ux of the window for runes is better than legendaries but only by a fraction. It could be done better.
---
geezus fucking joko this is beyond amazing let me try name it: Dhuum - Abaddon - knicare - mathias gabriel - qadim - xera and sabetha
---
Almost :p u missed sloth at the very bottom (some highlights make him a little faded which was annoying), and cairns face is between Knicare and Mat.
---
Wanted to add more in but time, and i started to rush this towards the end haha. Maybe once i figure out how to draw deimos better itl be a possibility lol
---
Well you can say anything but usually people will downvote you to oblivion if they don't agree with it (breaching the rule that downvotes aren't for disagreeing). There are even automated downvote bots.
---
Hold an apple above your head, people will appear
---
It's funny to know that Anet are a bunch of communists but they have nazis as mods.
---
but in general you can measure difficulty of something. we could say polish language is harder to learn than english - yoi will find ppl who find polish easier but in general polish is harder (on technical lvl)
---
This is something Diablo III does really well IMO. No matter what you do - you get mats/stuff/whatnot that WILL benefit you down the road. It's not a pure gold grind so you can buy the stuff off of AH, it's active gameplay in different areas and mechanics that power your final goal.
---
GW2 did a really good job with those legendary "stories" and parts, but completely messed it up with the insane amount of mats you need to get through most of the parts. For example, the amount of wood needed to craft a single Nevermore is insane. you WILL end up buying it from the AH instead of farming it yourself. It's stuff like that that made me quit GW and only come back for an hour when the new LS lands
---
Using another skill/action/whatever to cancel part of animation, or "aftercast" that happens after you use a skill,  but you have already dealt damage so that part is just a waste of time
---
Hell, even one support chrono can keep up permanent slow if he gives up his personal dps (F3 on cooldown with 3 clones, both shield4 casts and lost time instead of chronophantasma).
---
With second chrono and other slow sources (ren, dh traps) slow can be made permanent without too much changes in the support chrono builds.
---
Amazing!!
---
Nobody asked for it to be a free commander tag. You would just be able to create the standard 10-man-squad that literally everyone in the game can create. Of course it shouldn't give you markers, supplyinfo and all the other squad organizing stuff.
---
I like the new Sims 4 expansion.
---
Wow, so many helpful answers in such a short time. You are great.
---
I will answer more detailed in the next days, but for now some follow-up questions from my side.
---
- Power Dragonhunter with Greatsword and Scepter/Focus has been suggested many times. The problem that i see is, that, as far as I could find out, you will have to play melee anyway, because greatsword skills are Melee only. Traps do also have to be used in Melee range. Also signets suffer from the same problem as elementalist in open world, that the mobs can just run out of the field and take no damage whatsoever. Mobility doesn’t seem that good either. I do although like the group utility in aegis and the like.
---
- Thief with staff and pistols i tried, but didn’t really like. You do still have to use staff for good dps and you lose the mobility provided by shortbow. Also, as there is no such Build on snowcrows/metabattle/discretize, i question if it is really viable enough. Rifle Deadeye still has to be tested, but there also doesn’t seem to be a viable build around.
---
- Power Soulbeast isn’t an option because, as stated, I don’t want to switch to a different weapon for open world (longbow) vs instanced content (GS)
---
- Power Chronomancer although not suggested yet is a thing I would love to hear a bit more about. I took my lvl 2 Mesmer to the PvP-Lobby and tested the skills a bit, and I got to say, it seemed pretty nice. Greatsword Skills are all ranged, and unlike ele fields not possible for mobs to walk out. Same for utility skills (Phantasmal Disenchanter, Well of Calamity). The rotation also seems pretty easy, when camping GS. Just something like GS 2,3,4 and the aforementioned utility skills and F1/F3-shatter on CD with the occasional Continuum Split + Heal for burst damage with autoattack in between. Mobility is also a thing and CC seems pretty good, too. Most meta builds use GS+Sw/Sw though, so I don’t know if it’s a awful lot of dps I lose, when just using a GS and no Sw/Sw instead. When I look at the recent balance patch, camping GS does seem to have gotten a bit more viable. Self shatter, which favored standing in Melee range, is gone. Spatial Surge now skaling dynamically also helps dps a bit, because you don’t have to reach the first minimum distance threshold but instead standing a little bit outside but still in boon range already boosts your damage a bit. Alacrity and Quickness from shattering was also improved a bit. F1 (which is ranged) damage was also increased. New F3 slowing helps keeping up slow for massive Crit Dmg increase from Danger Time trait. Would love to hear your thoughts on this.
---
Further suggestions are also appreciated a lot.
---
Thanks!
---
Is there a you tube video I can learn?
---
Why is that so?
---
We need a method to acquire armor and weapons similar to the mist trinkets that have a consumable item one can use to stat swap all gear and this consumable should reset the stats on all unequipped "mists" gear and reset t he stats to be selectable again for a fraction of the cost of legendaries.  I'd make that.  In fact, I've been migrating a lot of my gear over to ruby and mist trinkets because of that feature to reset their stats.
---
Mainly hardcore players are bored of getting ready raid wings... Every 6 months.
---
yeah but for utility in discourse ppl present the popular opinion as the "generally agreed on" truth. and mostly ppl say raids are easier
---
the bottom one
---
this sub has a bot dedicated to downvoting all posts, regardless of their content. a lot of stuff gets buried by it lol
---
yeah thats why the tongue emote exists, as a signifier of joke. or do you want "wink wink" and "/s" too?
---
so are these the "main" exotic gear sets for DPS?
---
But they are good for your health :O
---
Commander, to me.
---
pretty sure they see everything that gets posted here, or at least the popular stuff. i found a small post (fluff obviously) and it had two dev comments. now they might not actually be commenting on anything of substance but hopefully they at least see all the important issues, even if they never seem to do anything about them.
---
Yeah, probably because they already played the content and know about it. I also think Raids aren't that difficult but also because I played some of them.
---
But that doesn't really changes the point because difficulty is subjective. some might think fractals are harder than raids, or the other way around. But you said it yourself, just so that you need more people makes them more difficult...
---
The bliss when you get your 18th piece of armor and you start saying 'title +role', not spamming
---
&gt; Is it just a game to play on the side, to log in to get that rush of "rewards!", chat with guild and log out again?
---
And my point is that a huge part of the raiding community is just like that. Most of them don't give a fuck about theorycrafting, they just copy the latest snow crow build, learn their rota without thinking too much about what some of their skills and traits even do. And then they get annoyed if they have to change their build. They get annoyed if they have to use a different class. They get annoyed if they don't get their kills after one or two tries. Just as you said, they simply want their instant-reward-gratification, chat a bit with the guild and be done with it.
---
Even supposedly hardcore or difficult content can and will cater to people with the semi-idle mentality. And even open world and story instances can and will cater to dedicated passionate gamers. There is no "either or".
---
Difficulty and challenge do not influence how hardcore the playerbase will be about the content. What truly attracts passionate gamers is *outstanding design.* A raid with truly interesting encounters will attract passionate players. But if open world content that only requires you to travel and press F tells a beautiful story in a really special atmosphere for example, it attracts passionate players just as much as the raid wing does (not saying they are the *same* people). Look at games like Journey. You literraly just walk around and jump/fly a little, there's no real challenge, and still people consider it as one of the most unique and amazing gaming experiences ever.
---
I would play that
---
My god me too! I was in 6th grade when GW launched! I was so into it!

Brusthonin flashbacks intensify.

That looks on the low side, that's what I make with my current T3 dailies+recs. Is the T4 bonus "only" the ascended gear drop rate?

There are plenty of other online games where you don’t have to kill the same mobs over and over to level.

---
It’s fun to have cool rewards.
---
a lot of deleted threads &amp; comments from the reddit. for some its okay, for some a bit over the top. they even deleted one of their own mod comments because it got downvoted into niravana.  
---
same with this survey shit. since years no one ever bothered for leaks, especially when they were real, just spoiler tag and go.  
---
suddenly, just because anet asks nicely, survey questions can't be made public here.
---
We already have (optional) challenge mode, just not on every boss. I think instas should be random to make players beat them all and not just take the easiest or fastest.
---
I need to see a photo of this. I need this to happen.
---
I shit on the idea of clearing labeling groups? where are you reading that? I think i repeated, i clearly label my groups about 8 times throughout this thread. I made one mistake that i havnt repeated since but cited as an example of how toxic this community's raiding  is.  And I use discord, reddit and the forums, it takes me up to two hours across all of them to get a group together, and a troll about 5 mins to sour it enough for people to leave.
---
The game is 7 years old, there is one but you also need to use your brain
---
yea because it's pretty much always the case? only dusk **might** be worth crafting because you save 80g 
---
but when you factor in the time spent on doing the collection even that one is probably better to just buy!
---
the "what if prices change" argument is pointless as well because that applies to anything really
---
don't add the permanent bank access into the sum because that thing is as useful as the copper-fed salvage kit. It's outragous that you have to pay thousands of gold for one because anet decided to place it as a super rare drop of the BLC instead of being a gem purchase on the gemstore like the copper-fed.
---
If you don't count the bank then the cost of an upgrade extractor is much cheaper. And think that if you have legendary weapons/armor you don't even need the extractor since you can replace sigils/runes/infusions freely.
---
I remember there was a topic once about a certain world event that was never successful unless organized properly. Someone took the opportunity to make several negative remarks about a guild I was in that ran the event. I guesd they were salty they couldn't get into our instance once or something (this was before squads and you had to ferry people in via parties). Naturally defended my guild respectfully,  explaining what and why. My comment was removed for being off topic, despite it still being about the event in relation to my guild.. yet their remarks got to stay because bashing a guild was apparently on topic. I stopped using the forums ever since.
---
I still think there is enough of those and more are coming :)
---
This is sick! Really well done, love the style.
---
Salut. Just use PayPal instead.
---
I'm also from RO and I have no issues with PayPal via ING.
---
I know right? I was so happy when they gave us the beetle race track deco pieces only to find out we can't really set up our own race :(
---
Putting in time would be okay if it would be fun at least. But chopping wood for 10 hours a week doesn't sound fun.
---
haha thank you.
---
Did Ajax Blue ever get unbanned? On Kaineng and have not seen him around in forever. Course, we're linked with Blackgate right now, so who would see him the the sea of zerg?
---
It caters to players who don't have time to commit to a meta. That's point 1. Point 2 is that if PoF followed the same model as HoT, it would split populations further and render older content obsolete faster. I thought I was clear on that?
---
These legendary upgrades are not "legendary" enough with the predefined behaviour if no visuals effects are going to be added. To make me consider crafting one of them the following features should be added:
---
- No clasification of legendary upgrades in different types. There should be an unique type available that covers every prefix/suffix.
---
- One of the upgrades should be enough to fill all of the available slots. So if you would only need one rune and one sigil per character. Of course you should still be able to select any prefix/suffix per slot.
---
They have HoT. If they made all future content in the same style as HoT, the zone would be dead and it would be a nightmare for players trying to farm those events.
---
no u
---
quality content
---
should post it as a link though...
---
alright, alright, I'll let you live for now
---
Worse even: the permanent upgrade extractor is CHEAPER than a full set of runes at 2600gold instant buy on EU, so you'd be better off to just buy all the runes and buy a permanent extractor rather than crafting this. ESPECIALLY if it works like a legendary and this gift of upgrades is only one out of 4 parts needed for a single rune
---
&gt;  and also retailers, doesnt include my country
---
Ye your best bet is to wait for the sale or use another countrys digital store.
---
That was the UKs DLGamer, which is an official retailer. You can also use the german DLgamer if you want to pay in euros.
---
If you want both though, You're going to have to wait because HoT doesn't go on sale much I don't think.
---
There is no guarantee will we have a sale though, it's all player speculation.
---
It's currently for a couple of them, not just dusk.
---
Time spent on crafting em is a moot point, it's literally playing the game, besides anyone crafting anything knows that it takes longer than just clicking once on the tp? That argument makes no sense to me I'm sorry. Even still gen 1 pres don't have nearly as much hassle as gen 2 pres in their collections.
---
And lastly, if it "always" was cheaper to craft than buy. It would be flipped, then you would be defending crafting instead when I mention that prices fluctuate. So saying it's pointless is funnily enough, pointless.
---
It's only the new trend because there's not too many other topics to talk about other than fluff.
---
just no
---
you either disregard the concept of opportunity cost entirely or somehow assume people generate no gold by playing(but how will they afford mats then?)
---
the point is it's better to do other, more productive stuff than the precursor collection..not about how "clicking on tp is easier"
---
as for why it's not cheaper to craft, that was explained by anet devs themselves..something about the journey and feeling of progression(yes, even when collections were released for leges many were not worth crafting and many complaints were made)
---
If only the in-game graphics looked this good
---
&gt; pretty high 
---
What, almost every other build is higher, some are higher for over 20% of what Holo can get.
---
CM's + t4s+ recs i open about 60 boxes by using the 30 daily keys + 20 from the daily intergrated fractal matrices + the bonus mystic coins. It ends up around 30-40g depending on rng. Have to say that not running cms severely cuts your daily gold from fracs. Actual fractal farming as in repeating the same fractal over and over again is gone at this point. Most runs take around 1h maybe 1:30 if there are delays.
---
Anyway atm it is probably the most lucrative content in the game. Even with slow groups it is still worth it.
---
Pretty high relatively to what I was expecting
---
But yeah engi is fucked and since this was the only reason I've been playing gw2, I'll look to get a refund anyway
---
It doesnt even need any effect and i would still be happy to grind for it.
---
I had the choice between wow and guildwars, I was 13 I made the right choice with guildwars
---
Sounds good in theory until you realise how bad some people are at games. Guaranteed a lot of people are just gonna faceroll until something works and they've broken the bar without even realising what was going on and continue on their marry way
---
I think they meant while the breakbar is up. So if there's an active breakbar already, it wouldn't scale up until the next time it comes up again
---
DH has area block. Thief has awesome cc. Soulbeast can bring condi cleanse and spirits for example.
---
Holo can, eh, dps race the core warrior. The sword build with 31k dps has 200breakbar damage. The old rifle build with cc has just 30k and is not even listed anymore. CC IS utility. Holo does currently vuln nobody needs and can bring 200breakbar dmg. Thats nothing. Holo's current sword ecsu build needs a flat 20% modifier to be worth it. This wont happen so playing power engi is pretty close to trolling. Cengi is only decent on Desmina thanks to confusion but even there mirage is just so much better.
---
should mark this as season 5 spoiler

Watching this fellt like a roller coaster ride!
---
Very nice footage
---
Thats my secret my friend I posted it already Haha
---
I used to DJ for blade radio WAYYYY back in the day lol I miss the community on guildwars it was so tight knit
---
Next week starts festival of four winds, and next month you can probably expect some big update as well, so yes, it is pretty much worth it. It always was.
---
Again, they aren't supposed to be interchangeable.
---
A mentor isn't supposed to be a baby Commander. It's a tag designed to help people, not lead groups. You can pop a tag and map chat "X enemy popped here" or "Apple tag for JP". It's things like that. So you can advertise your willingness to help people. Not exactly to lead them.
---
A Commander tag isn't really saying they are helping people. It's saying they are leading people. This is why they can lead raids. This is why they can lead 50 man groups. This is why (if squad settings allow) you can join on them on the map. If you want to command, you have to get a real tag. The small barrier to entry is to stop people with zero idea what they are doing from leading people. Fresh level 80s generally can't afford a tag. People with no idea what's going on aren't likely to drop 300g on a tag just for funsies. It's priced at a point where people who know what they are doing aren't going to take a massive hit, but it's high enough to keep people not dedicated away.
---
Can't you just join a 10 man squad without a tag and still do raids? What difference would a mentor tag even make?
---
If you want to follow their comps, no.
---
Druids aren't bad in general though. They are still fine in content, and most pugs still use two.
---
If they drop infusions, well ...
---
To be fair, getting your camera lined up and seeing through the visual clutter in that tiny room can be quite something.

Don't get me wrong, I don't either, but I'm also not going to shit talk them for the hours and hours they put into build design, just cause they don't spend even more time updating their site in a way I approve of.
---
They give us a vast amount of information for free. They help the wider community get better at raids, for free. They have a public Discord you can go in and ask for help and advice, for free. Get out of here with this "I guess they just don't care anymore" bullshit because you don't like the way they update one part of their site.
---
I usually don’t like art posts on reddit but this looks great
---
Maybe like, let people decide for themselves what they think is fun?
---
Thank you!
---
You can do so much cool stuff with this mount ♡ thx!
---

---
Fun fakt - I have KH based character xD thank you!
---
Yes, it is! :D There are so much fun stuff you can do with a griffon.
---
Thank you, Nil ♡♡♡

Different story. Time gating is diametically opposed to grind. They're the opposite. If something is time gated, you can't grind it out. No one is saying time gating is good here. But it's certainly not grind. As for not making progress, you make progress every day. What you're really saying is you want to grind it out and you can't. And that's fair enough. You're not alone in that.
---
I love real roller coaster :D thx!
---
Thats a funny joko.
---
You need HoT currencies
---
You can use PoF's too, but i think with HoT is faster
---
In this case you'll need to maximize Hot masteries and complete map explorations
---
And around 1000 airship parts, leyline Crystal and lump aurilium
---
I hope to remember right
---
Do people tell you to swap character and play power? With all this power creep, playing condi seems to be unefficient in short fights (few seconds burn to 66% at b1 in 100CM). I quit playing my condi mirage in fractals because of people telling me "ONLY POWER" and "You did half of my dps".
---
Sounds more like you've never played heal ren if you think heal ren has less flexibility than druid in healing. And it's not assumptions if you've done it. I could care less if you raid 5x a week; time spent =/= good raider.
---
One of the most popular GW fan made videos. So popular people still link it 12 years later.
---
I can't imagine why bots like this haven't been banned by reddit admins yet. Should be simple enough to find reddit accounts that are mass downvoting subreddits.

Interesting content. Thanks for organizing it.
---
I am thinking that the gift of upgrades, plus 250 ecto, plus a gift of whassname plus 77 clovers = a box of 7 Legendary runes. (6 armour plus 1 for waterbreathing)
---
Then a gift of something (that is 250x each of the three symbols) plus the above = 4 legendary Sigils
---
Gutted they have no effects. Even a little tiny sparkle to the armour or weapon would have been nice.
---
Sims 4: Area 51
---
Dark purple on black text? Yeah, no that's fine.
---
Guild Wars 2 with RTX on.
---
But then he'd stop delivering content
---
Negative criticism if delivered civilly isn’t toxic
---
Oh jeez... This reminds me of my grandpap's favorite dad joke. 
---
He'd say something about a "honeymoon salad" and when someone inevitably asked what that was, he'd explain: *lettuce alone, no dressing!*
---
exordium like all his generation legendary is plain stupid. 
---
i have a 1 gen leg (minstrell)
---
a 2 gen leg (astralaria)
---
and a 3rd gen leg (sharur)
---
all the 3rd gen leg are just material sink.  33k wood and 42k mithril ? are u kidding me ? crafting sharur was a huge pain and was boring  i hope they will bring back a story for each legendary like it was for 2nd gen
---
Unless you happen to like Dragon Stand, and then it's not. I've never had a problem with having enough Crystalline Ingots.
---
Thank you, this was a very informative reply. I didn't know most of the og devs left, since I liked their game so much any word on what game they are working on over at Amazon?
---
It always amazes me that when mods set forth rules that have consequences for their community and people break them that they suffer consequences.
---
Its like teens that are caught by their parents throwing a fit of "GAWD I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING!"
---
Why aren't you playing on NA servers?
---
The crazy thing is they put up these numbers with two utility slots used up. And anet thought they aren’t doing enough. Meanwhile other pure dps classes struggle to come close.
---
(imade this to help people planning to make it and keep track on progress.)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bje1ww/google_sheet_for_exordium_for_those_looking_to/]
---
Keep in mind the note at the bottom of the spreadsheet on how to save about 200g over the traditional method of crafting exordium
---
Ngl thought this was sims
---
point being he said **even** does more damage when not even people with single digit iq would be surprised by the fact that having 5 people do damage turned out to be more than having 3 people do damage.
---
You need to use the Mount 2 skill, not the engage skill from the skill bar. You can bind the key in the control option menu
---
Now just imagine some player near by that saw you fly out of the cave and do the flippy thing. Nice work you made some people's day.
---
No. The 4 with a collection are 1.5. All the others 2.0
---
Hell yeah I remember this!
---
99 is where it's at for me! The fights feel more dynamic and interactive...
---
100cm is like... more "square", i feel a bot/macro could do my job 99% of the time.
---
Idk, arrk is boring af and arts adds are cancer.
---
Skorvy is the one i like the most, i wish he attacked people instead of spinning in place like he has brain damage...
---
My faith in Roy's ability to provide entertainment versus my faith in anet to completely waste any resources and potential at their disposal...
---
I think this leads to an unstoppable force vs immovable object type of discussion.
---
This is especially true with DH dps...  Everybody be breaking way too soon and acting proud of themselves. :(
---
Oh, I want aware of that. Thank you!
---
I don't think it's just hardcore raiders. There has been a lot of concern voiced in regards to what ep5 will be and lack of expansion.
---
Lack of elite specs leave both PvP modes stale since balance patches aren't Anets strong point.
---
NA canceled because not enough players interested in GvG still playing. They only got 45 sign ups or something.
---
Not sure if you expect me to arguing. I never said anything pro time gate. I simply said that the first three sky scale collections are not grindy. That's ALL I said. If you want to say you don't like time gating, I have no issue with that statement.
---
Tybalt, introduction

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
-------
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Guildwars2) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
there is a section of "submit a bug report" in the ESC -&gt; Support section.
---
There you can add the bug and submit it with a screenshot. This is the best way to do this because this could get burried.
---
not being able to insta cc is kinda meh, but groups that cc ensolyss before his diving animation is super obnoxious as slb...
---
I feel you... Right now i do my dailies + fractals, craft and sell 3 items... And thats it.
---
I play 2 hrs max and that includes afking a bit in mistlock.
---
I would love new fractals...
---
Jack also predicted [Mounts in WvW](https://youtu.be/SWCTlxEp6Ds?t=176) before they even made it into PvE.
---
Not really. It loses some dps but doesn't lose 50% hp AND gets locked out of major dmg source for 20+sec.
---
There is also staff daredevil you can fall back on which has high damage and a braindead rotation.
---
Kill explorer.exe in the task manager and restart it manually.
---
Thanks, tbh i agree too, i wasnt going to post it but my gf convinced me otherwise lol
---
So now would be a good time?
---
Time for infiltration!
---
Hey I saw ur Reddit post with it, maybe I'm stupid but I found it a bit too confusing xd
---
Well I do play on the NA servers actually, I play on both regions! There's typically more going on, on the EU region however, in terms of tournaments and what not, since the scene there is more organized and populated.
---
when the 3 zergs collide in t1 i may as well be playing eve online with the timadilation in skills.
---
Does Lightning Rod trigger if the target has stability? Metabattle says that it triggers even if the CC is negated by stability, but the wiki's wording on the ability ("triggers after the target is disabled") sounds like stability prevents Lightning Rod from triggering.
---
I did the fight on my Daredevil on the first few days after relase when it was in its original non nerfed state. I did it 1. try without dying once or looking it up anywhere (i did go downstate though but everything rallied you there so no big deal). You have tons of dodges on daredevil and i read much later that people where apparently struggeling with this one. I actually enjoyed it how it was originally designed because it had a "bossfight feeling".
---
&gt; Holo does currently vuln nobody needs
---
And yet, that part was praised before the patch as quite the non-selfish positive, being able to quickly stack Vulernability, which was especially helpful on bosses with multiple targets. The CC a Thief has access to has remained very much the same for years, whether it is what is now or when people were calling thief "the" selfish DPS class(long before the rifle Deadeye build, which arguably -is- one of the most selfish builds you can get, was a thing).
---
It feels very much like a flavor of the month thing to me to what people consider to be "selfish", even if the tools for party/squad support are readily available on each class.
---
What's up with this grieving/sinister/viper combo for condi firebrand? Is it better than full viper's now?
---
. . . 
---
Did you read what I wrote? Yes, you're getting more loot. This is not up for debate. But you claim to not be having fun, while the people who spent hours learning to kill the DPS Golem, or what have you, *are* having fun.
---
You used the phrase "only effective gameplay." What do you mean by this? This isn't a game about collecting gold. That's certainly part of it, but the game exists to have fun. if you're not having fun, then try something else. 
---
OTOH, if you're one of those people who only have fun by "winning" the game, that is to say, by finding the most efficient way to get something, and then just doing that over and over and over, then no, this isn't a good fit for you. I used to have some friends like that, and GW2 was just not good for them. This game is a good fit for people who have fun by *playing* the game.
---
That's not a judgement, either. We all have fun in our own way, but it's no good me saying that FPS are bad games, because they aren't fun for me. Plenty of people like FPS, and good on them.
---
&gt; i dont think that its accurate to pay around 100$ for 30gb game, which is crafting simulator, instead of an actual mmorpg.
---
Did you know that they included a combat system with the crafting simulator? Also a large map, mobs to kill, a story, group content, solo content, and more content every few months? If you squint, it rather does look like an MMORPG, which isn't bad, for a crafting simulator.
---
&gt; am i bad girl?
---
You are restricting yourself to the least interesting facet of the game, because it's the only part that appeals to your sense of fun, and declaring the game to be at fault. The game isn't restricting you, you are choosing this. I wouldn't go so far as "bad," but you seem to be misguided.
---
I play with action cam also.
---
Things you could try:
---
* win+m for minimiting all, then go back to gw2
---
* win+d for showing the desktop (also minimizes)
---
* maybe try those in combination with action cam on/off
---
Do you use a second monitor?
---
Wooded pussy....
---
IS THERE BUTTER?!?!? THE MASSES MUST KNOW!
---
The win+m and win+d with action camera on and off didn't help me.
---
I do use a second monitor.
---
Ans I am encountering this problem every time I play the game.
---
Woahh there's a name I haven't heard in a while. "I ecto farm with blade radio"
---
Wish we had some griffon races, the adventures are nice but way too short :(.
---
This was insanely good for what people had as fan videos back in the day. This is vintage YouTube
---
I just tried and it didn't fix it.
---
Pure class
---
And you forever will. There is no game on the market that can handle huge fights. Even EVE Online, BUILD for that kind of fight, implemented a kind of bullet time feature to work around servers getting gangraped by 500 people all mashing buttons like coked up monkeys.
---
Doesn't sound like this will work for you, but when the taskbar is over my game I just open the start menu by clicking the start button or pressing the windows key and then click back on the game and it's fixed.
---
Reduce interface size
---
They might have used their buff skills though to make you hit harder
---
Lol right? Might as well call then 4.3
---
As much as I enjoy the Skyscale, Griffon is still my favourite mount. This video perfectly illustrates why.
---
I’ve been playing GW and GW2 for many years. 
---
I’m currently playing FFXIV and thoroughly enjoying it. After finishing the latest season of living world, I was aggravated that the only end game content is fetch quests for collections, those don’t interest me. 
---
I don’t need a sky scale so badly that I’m going to go hunt for a bunch of random crap.
---
Shadow ringers: people are watching new expansion content before buying or jumping in.
---
WoW: without fail always has viewers, go check their other games. With mythic+ runs and World First events going it will continue to have more viewers than any other MMO, because that's how Blizzard retains subs.
---
GW2: hasn't had anything new. Doesn't have the reach for sPVP leagues as Blizzard. People are instead watching YouTube to figure out htf to do anything because of the farming.
---
I mean FFXI is still kicking, but the launch of XIV was awful. They’ve made a comeback. Wow you could say is dying a slow death with each expansion. They will get a ton of tourists for classic, but most modern MMO players will not like it. GW2 is 7 years old with many more years if you add in GW1 for a legacy. The franchise is over 10 years old, it just is fringe because people don’t know about it.
---
You might wanna invest in lubricants
---
Why not mute the game and listen to a streamer in the backround?
---
Pressing the Windows key doesn't works.
---
Making the "Automatically Hide the Taskbar" option OFF works, the taskbar doesn't go onto GW2 anymore, yet I wanted to keep it ON because I don't like to have the taskbar present at all time on my screens.
---
I have 2 monitors : my taskbar is on the left of the screen for the right monitor and on the right of the screen for the left monitor in order to have both in the center and I find this annoying to have such a big portion of my screens dedicated to this.
---
Pack. So you can give allies Fury.
---
outdated shit with copy paste text from the introduction trailers.  
---
probably was even 2011 never close to the truth of gw2 combat anway.  
---
might as well just read the wiki which is just as good.  
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page
---
If it doesn't include the specializations, it's not worth your time and it doesn't so don't buy it. Use online guides for free instead
---
The hero we need. Delivering the content we deserve!
---
Fetch quests are the worst thing you could pick as point of comparison.
---
The amount of fetch quests in FF XIV is absolutely mind boggling
---
monk.
---
Ok guys, thx so much for the quick reply!
---
No.
---
You can click on the thumbnail to see a sample of the book's starting pages. From this I can see how out-of-date and/or wrong the book is, not just about the current state of the game but also back when this *2012* ebook was new.
---
This will not be useful for anyone.
---
Honestly its fine that those 2 have more viewers but I looked at the MMORPG Categories today and there are quite a few games where I think its actually sad that even those beat out GW2. Like Metin 2, Dofus, Albion, whatever ROBLOX is and Ragnarok.
---
I dont mind if the big names like BDO, WoW, Runescape, TES, etc. have more viewers.
---
I think at the time Anet made the decision all by themselves to push forward their casual LWS content and side-projects in favor of the "niche" (in regards to the Gw2 playerbase) hardcore content like raids - or challenging instanced content altogether. Gw2 never managed to captivate a large amount of dedicated hardcore MMO players as dungeons were mediocre and the gear progression is horizontal by design. Raids later on weren't very popular with the casual playerbase - some were even upset about the introduction of raids! Subsequently Anet gave up on moving the game towards more challenging content, that is more fun (imo) but requires a bit of dedication and skill. It just didn't stick with the community by and large. 
---
I wish Anet had persisted in their push towards challenge, fun and rewards that are accomplishments instead of a grind. But they might have alienated an important part of their playerbase in the process without winning over much of the hardcore communities of other MMOs.
---
It sucks to admit it, but Anet's decision wasn't unreasonable at all, even though they gave up on making Gw2 a better albeit different game. The most fun parts of Gw2 to me are PvP, raid CMs and (pre-POF) WvW and they all failed to acquire a large enough following.
---
The only hope left: After the cancellation of their opaque side-projects there might be more development effort on Gw2 across the board. But that's just grasping at straws, I certainly don't believe it. Why would they do so now that the game is 7 years old?!
---
Yes it has fetch quests, but it also has a really fantastic story, lore, music, and graphics. So at least while I’m out fetching items I get to enjoy what I’m looking at and listening to. 
---
And as I’ve been progressing through the story, it’s higher quality than even the latest story from GW2 in just the very first game. As I understand it, all the FFXIV expansions are a step above A Realm Reborn in every way.
---
Why would i want to mute the beautiful ingame music to listen to a streamer?
---
It looks very interesting but well made :)
---
It doesn't work for me.
---
Definitely not, I've said a lot of stupid salty shit over the years, never had one of my posts/comments removed on reddit.
---
I think Twitch has kind of become a measure of a generation gap. For some people, they grew up watching stuff on Twitch or YouTube as opposed to, say, watching something on TV. So to them it's natural to attribute Twitch success to game success because that viewership metric is what they're familiar with.
---
Meanwhile grandpas like me have trouble understanding why you'd watch someone play instead of playing the game yourself. I can kind of understand someone stuck at low ranking in a pvp system wanting to watch and learn from someone at a high ranking, but I really don't get the whole stream culture of buying bits and wdhatnot for posting memes in chat.
---
This game never had potential to be twitch hit since e-sport attempt failed. And it's fine, unless all you do is watch streamers, then I guess it's never been a game for you.
---
Pretty much when the real NA GvG scene died.  We all should have known WvW was pretty much dead from that point on.  The progress we've had since then is pretty minimal at best.  Such a shame.
---
If you're playing Firebrand/Renegade, go with Pack runes for Fury. If you're playing heal Tempest or Druid you should probably stick with Monk.
---
this isn't really a bug, as it does exactly what it should do: by moving the mouse to the bottom of the screen (or wherever you placed your taskbar) it will show up always in any non fullscreen app (borderless fullscreen is not the same as fullscreen). the only time it doesn't do that is for fullscreen app, as that tells it the app has precedence. for example if you fullscreen a video it'll still show the taskbar because most videoplayers don't grab the screen exclusively.
---
you can either switch to fullscreen (having 2 monitors I wouldn't recommend it, as the game minimizes if you click something on the other screen) or just keep the taskbar open. if you reduce the scaling for icons, remove labels etc it really shouldn't be wasting that much space, maybe 5% or so?
---
FFXIV says a lot because that is probably the most boring MMORPG to watch (playing it is fine though).
---
.....people know game exists, just nothing new......

---
There’s a small update header on the site itself.
---
....games have music? /s
---
FFXIV and WoW release their expansions about every 2 years, they just have a lot of content inbetween.
---
Why would you try to join an experienced group when you are not experienced? Are you that entitled?  
---
Just make a no kp group if you need to learn, and play with people willing to train you or learning themselves (btw i guarantee you can get 50, 100 and even 200kp dudes in your team even if you don't ask for kp). 
---
Play an easy to meta build, don't go trying to learn on weaver or special snowflake builds; Watch Youtube guides. Solo skorvald and mama... If you still need help join a guild that will train you.
---
You say you play well; let me fix your problem right now! We run at reset, my account is wharrgarbl.9263. 
---
Bring a DPS class or Banner support warrior, and we will take you for a spin.
---
I also do CM training for guildies (mechanics, bs/DPS basics and healbrand in depth). You can message me about that too if you are interested.
---
I don't understand. They announce the next LW season there or something else?
---
[this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bjjn8o/for_those_who_plan_to_craft_exoridum/) does a really good job of explaining why/how it works if you're still curious
---
So are we finally gonna get Build Templates?
---
A 45 minute living world announcement?
---
I don’t think the word “expansion” means why you think it means in this context, just a FYI.
---
Don't forget about "FFXIV and WoW are only popular because of their namesake".
---
Maybe wait and see what they actually show before shitting all over it.
---
I'm sad its over a month away but its good to know something is coming. Also this is new for Anet the only time they have done anything like this for living world is back with the revamped Teq.
---
I did like 6 months ago
---
We have known officially that we are getting build templates since April, I believe.
---
 [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/)
---
And the stream VOD will probably have more replay value than the content itself
---
haha after years this video is still gold !
---
Another 'look at my character' post. Wow.
---
Nah, I know it's gonna be trash by the fact that it's called "living world"
---
Salad pussy in the neck mmmhhh
---
[Have you had nothing better to do in the past year than make the exact same comment over and over again?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8s8rwx/no_raid_to_release_with_the_next_living_story/e0xfzhq/)
---
Oh my God is happening.
---
Excited for this! The last special live event they did was the announcement of HoT and a bunch of people were sat around the mystic forge in the busted up Lion's Arch and we all had a merry time screaming in excitement. We had the Cooking with Queen Jennah and the Quaggan Deep Thoughts, and those were all fantastic. :D Looking forward to something as wonderful!
---
when does it die again?
---
&gt;Hoping the next season comes out before the end of September.
---
That feels optimistic. Don't get me wrong I would love to be wrong here, it just seems unlikely.
---
You'd be surprised with the amount of people that have no idea what guild Wars 2 is yet know about most other mmos.
---
Yep. More or less something like that. 
---
Twitch is a much more *personalized* experience in the sense that it feels like a 1 on 1 interaction with the streamer, even if there is a larger audience around it. You get to choose which one you want to watch and that only amplifies that personal investment into the channels you watch.
---
also heehaw funny comic but let's be real the difference between watching a streamer play a game and playing it yourself is just owning the game and starting it up vs. sports require a physical place, people, and equipment/fitness. I don't really care about sports / TV in general so I was just trying to go for a common denominator kind thing and maybe didn't pick the best example :V
---
A 45 minute event smells like new elite specs to me.
---
Really, it smells a lot like the PoF reveal. I'm just a bit confused because... this is a living world thing. Surely they wouldn't be kicking off one episode + one map with a presentation that big in a live venue. Something else smells smelly.
---
Promo for Guardians of the Galaxy?
---
Wow...Nice, I hope new specs would be coming! Maybe a water mount to speed up the diving thing. Well, I love so much this game! I will be watching live from YouTube!
---
45 minutes. 
---
* 4 minutes of new WvW balance
---
* 6 minutes of Open world and story
---
* 9 times 4 minutes for each new elite spec
---
I'm with you here. I love mounts but we have enough and besides they were the POF big ticket item and it was my understanding that season 5 was going to be more separated from POF than season 4 was.
---
then stop crying and go play another game
---
It can mean, like they may be shaking the ground with their living world... :O 
---
Like it's something completely new we will see in LS!
---
I won't set my expectations very high, but I'm willing to be pleasantly surprised.
---
Won't be Cantha though, so...
---
Griffon rage incoming
---
i have a bad feeling that they could say:
---
sorry we made a mistake in the last balance patch .. we buffed Ele instead of nerfing it.. In this video you see the new nerfed ele!
---
Have fun with our MORE buffed 1200 range cancer condition spam builds. ( wvw sight of view )
---
Yes. The price will only go up or you can just wait when anniversary sale will be over ;) it is really good to get some gems ready for sales
---
Might be the reason I'm not a sports fan either. :p
---
Then why are you here lol
---
Guessing you're not counting the downtime from progress preventing bugs.
---
new feature: player housing
---
I believe so. Path of Fire just got a livestream
---
My body is ready...
---
Well, they did say to expect expansion features for season 5. I think we're going to see what new features will be released over the next year during season 5 (build templates, cooking level increase, wvw alliance system, new mount maybe, new specializations/dual professions). Plus a reveal trailer for episode 1.
---
You can try to check on the evenings the price is dropping a bit but it wont go below 128 imo
---
yeah! and in the middle Aurene-y looking "GW2 Living World"
---
&gt;(housing would be lovely)
---
I get some people want to play House Simulator everywhere but I hope that isn't it
---
its too shallow
---
to complain about how bad the game is
---
If the DPS pulls 40% of what they should they are like... Alacren levels?
---
That means support aint buffing or they deserve the kick :)
---
Healing is not an issue for me because i play healbrand so i can't comment, but there are quite a few alacrens that give alac and THATS IT, no stab no might nothing. I hate those (it's so bad that my gg top 1% weaver friend rerolled alacrigade lol)
---
Oh I'm already way ahead on that lol
---
where did they hint that?
---
Probably, we also had a fire/ice dye pack sale in gemstore not long ago, Anet has used these hints before.
---
The forum mods need some way to compensate because they're not reddit mods
---
...I am so tired of fucking dragon garbage. If this is the case I may finally uninstall.
---
I'm getting real mixed signals from so many people commenting - people are happy to teach you, you're entitled for trying to learn, not worth trying to do x or y... It's really annoying and doesn't help :/
---
I can almost never play during reset, only nights or mornings
---
PoF had one as well.
---
ok, I admit that part of the whole ordeal seems buggy. it's pretty easy to capture the mouse so it doesn't actually move, and they certainly don't do that. another, around here probably better known, example is using action cam and moving the 'imaginary' pointer towards the minimap. suddenly your mouse wheel no longer zooms in/out the camera but the minimap. 
---
however, it's not a bug with windows or it's taskbar settings, so this kinda threw me off =) 
---
while the example is perfectly fine, I think to better convey the problem just focus on the fact that in action cam, the mouse pointer still moves invisible around the screen. examples are that it can trigger stuff like the minimap zooming or the windows taskbar. you kinda went the other way around and focused on the taskbar issue, which most people won't be able to relate to. no offense meant, I just think a rewrite could clarify it a bit and make it so more people understand the underlying problem, while using your particular issue only as an example.
---
This. The hype part is usually better than the release for me. Something i just love about it. I know it will be a let down, but i'm just gonna sit back and enjoy the hype/news/speculation. I'm full of smiles.
---
\&gt; You get to choose which one you want to watch and that only amplifies that personal investment into the channels you watch. 
---
So, like picking a TV channel or show to watch, then.
---
\&gt; let's be real the difference between watching a streamer play a game and playing it yourself is just owning the game and starting it up vs. sports require a physical place, people, and equipment/fitness 
---
You can literally buy just a ball and play rather than watching sports. It's only a generation thing in that hobbies and the medium they're displayed on have changed.
---
10 minutes about the content
---
35 minutes making cringy quaggan jokes and talking about how cute aurene is
---
nah -we go full GoT - Fire and Ice: we got dragons, main chsracter returning from dead, dead bad guys, bad dead ice guys, humor, politics and traveling speed of season 6+
---
thats at least for one emmy
---
I'm hoping much more than that. Build templates belong in a quality of life patch, like the wardrobe was.
---
Why not click it and read?
---
Soon™
---
Kurzick vs Luxon?
---
Please anything but dragons..
---
They said they want to deliver expansion-tier of stuff withing Living world. So why everyone acts surprised when it actually looks like they actually are going to do it?
---
It was a joke...
---
&gt; yeah another season of """living world""" is gonna save this dead game
---
&gt; more of the same zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
/u/Petrillss 
---
hey /u/neok182, can we get the troll banned already? It's a literal troll account that genuinely does nothing but spam ded gaem over and over again. We really don't have to tolerate that kind of psychotic bullshit, do we?
---
Awwww, you know I totally misread that thinking they were talking about next Tuesday lol, I'm now also sad and disappointed
---
[Hnnggggg!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusZXECS0mM)
---
They said that Season 5 would have expansion level content included. Maybe they learned their lesson after claiming Sun's Refuge was that and instead actually understand what "expansion level content" actually is.
---
I'm pretty sure if GW2 has a brawling mode like WoW's Arena, sPvP viewership will rise. Conquest is just boring to watch.
---
Don't give me hope.
---
Going out with a bang and all that. I'm a pessimist and I was around to see how they just ended GW1 pretty much.
---
Cool to see thanks for taking time to make this video. I’ve never done this ever hopes this helps someone.
---
On a serious note, what lags? I hardly experienced any lags, so I'd assumed the problem is on your end.
---
You slutty ho
---
Why do you consider ffxiv a chore to play?
---
It looks like we might be getting something bigger than just more story. Could they be revealing elite specs for Living World?
---
Taimi the Broken?
---
I'll see what we can do about that - temporarily at least.
---
45 minutes press conference, or just a 45 min demo?
---
Hm, thinking about the business justification is interesting.
---
Pure speculation, but it could be possible that they have "almost" an expansion in their back pocket, but they've held it back because marketing a bunch of LW releases close together would pull in more players than announcing an expansion.
---
Yes, it's account wide.
---
Not impossible, it just feels unlikely to me. Call it being jaded or whatever but the release schedule has been fairly helter skelter since the layoffs earlier this year. Again, I'd love to be wrong here but at the same time I'm not upset at waiting. I've got other games I can play in the mean time.
---
dx 12 option, that would define big change for me
---
New specs new race new lands that’s my guess
---
Using different chars for different crafts is the best option.
---
Why its a living world season just like season 1, 2, 3 and 4.
---
Please just leave it’s so pathetic like there really isn’t anything else to do in life than just complain about a game you quit long time ago? Go enjoy a new game and be passionate and positive about something you enjoy. It will make you a happier person.
---
&gt;  or they deserve the kick :)
---
That's the thing, you'd be kicking a good 80% or more of the pugs at that point lol. Try playing DH and compare yourself to the pugs and you'll see what I mean.
---
Don't give me hope, please
---
Who's to say that being able to enjoy life, play other games and complain about GW2 are mutually exclusive?
---
I can easily do all of those things at once.
---
Hahah I was going to make this joke, but I didn’t want to go to the reddit basement. The fact that they are live streaming it makes me think it’s going to be a meaty release. 
---
I really think they get one more shot for a bunch of people. If this is a nothing burger release and business as usual, a lot of people will flock. Another grueling season is too much.
---
From the title I was expecting something along the lines of "boo hoo more internet drama about anet and gw2".
---
I'm glad I was wrong.
---
Now to answer your question, I think it's unlikely that the dragonsblood furnace will be reused as a plot device. When it was introduced, it rather felt like a quick solution to the conflict we were facing at the time, rather than a solid base to build the story off of.
---
it may be something like Kormir and Abaddon in Nightfall, that even though Kormir consumed all his magic, the dragons rose anyway. 
---
And now when Aurene got so powerful, and "she is the first of her kind" - no wonder Jormag and Primordus will want to take her down.
---
thats what we thought about the white mantle too :p
---
Let’s get excited for 2hrs worth of content that is worthless and a story that’s meh.
---
frozen ocean is also quite aquatic, isn't it? ;)
---
\&gt;  housing would be lovely 
---
This is why I haven't spent almost any of my mats or gold for the past 3 years.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cgzlnl/gw2_censorship/
---
&gt;i even doubt it was relevant back then as people had no clue how to play ~~2 months after launch~~ and still don't.
---
Yeah, 45 minutes at a live venue is a bit much for just a new episode. Elite Specs is probably the safe bet, but I would say stuff related to the new WvW system isn't too unlikely as well. As for release cadence, seeing as they've been chronically unable to hit their *current* target for most of S4 I somehow doubt they're going to ramp it up, but if they really want to earn some brownie points doubling down on the current 2-3 months schedule with some sort of "if we miss the deadline we'll give all players X Gems or keys or something per week until we catch up" thing would probably go a long way towards assuring people they mean business. A long shot, perhaps, but I can dream.
---
Its an announcement about an announcement taking place *over a month from now* and people are already shilling like its new content right around the corner.
---
Definitely, not saying it's a sure thing. But people complain about all kinds of things that Anet has no intention of changing, and there's very little relevant underwater content to begin with. Anyway, I guess we'll see. I'm rooting for Cantha
---
This is what my tin foil is seeing https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/182808386121891840/604364549461639199/tin_foil.jpg
---
Damn, maybe i should get back into metin.
---
Well atleast the lady audience is getting some attention, can't complain about that.
---
So what is the meme referring to and why is it offensive? If a meme in twitch chat truly was offensive, I'd bet that would be agains TOS, just saying.
---
Well, that's two fairly major surprises for me in a week; at least this one is giving me some sense of optimism. I'm a bit disappointed that this basically confirms we won't be getting S5 until September 6th at the soonest (unless they pull a surprise "launching today" reveal at the end of the presentation, which I would be totally behind), but on the bright side one doesn't book 45 minutes at a live venue to *only* reveal a new Living World episode. I'm betting on a new set of Elite Specializations and Build Templates (if they don't sneak out at the same time as Legendary Upgrades, that is), but they also have enough time to give the WvW Alliance system some attention as well.
---
&gt;Okay, I am sorry for this, it was already kinda hard to express myself in an understandable english and I didn't really paid attention to this.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I will try to edit the message a bit in order to focus more on the Action Camera. And personally I never had minimap problems with the Action Camera and even when trying to replicate it I can't seem to do it either.  
---
&gt;Sorry for the misunderstanding 'x'
---
Seriously. It’s fine to criticize the game and ArenaNet, but people have been taking it way too far lately.
---
"Furnace taken" is an anagram to "fuck arena net"
---
Swimming techniques.
---
I honestly love Sun's refuge and love the detail work they have with NPC's all over the place. I wanted guild halls to be more like that, and less "big open spaces" like what we have now.
---
I don't trust Anet to go back and work on older things, but introducing the idea of different "tiers" of guild hall for different sized guilds could be nice.
---
I'm not raising my hopes but I hope it's something cool like elite specs. :&gt;
---
I was DJ Vizy haha
---
More Charr politics and lands would be nice.
---
u/WoodenPotatoes, can you confirm or deny?
---
Is that supposed to be offensive??
---
AAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It is when official anet partner enables it.
---
he's never saying the letters in that order though so its fine
---
we have a ton of items, the basis of a system for moving and placing those items, and the basis of tech for instance owners and entering marked instances (used for guild missions and PS missions). It would be fairly easy to add on and refine that to make something good and new with nominal effort, just a matter of if they would chose to do it.
---
Dofus 1.29 is actually one of the best designed mmorpgs tho
---
Send this to WoodenPotatoes. He'll make a 3 hour long video about it.
---
Nah, Logan will marry the queen before finding out she is really his aunt.
---
Nah, my bad on that.  I sometimes forget that Reddit has no tone of voice..lol
---
Do  Gourdon XD and more of dragons watch
---
New classes are 0% and they've said as much, so I wouldn't out much stock in that option sadly. Though with how creative some of their PoF elite specs were I am interested to see just how different from the base class some of their new specs might feel in the future.
---
No...just no.
---
Yip, that's pretty much what I would want. A smaller personal instance others can visit, uses Guild Hall system, decorations from content like raids, WvW, dungeons, metas and a reasonable gold sink. Throw in racial housing themes and we're good!
---
Yes it's not an MMO, but determining the worst offender in terms of clusterfuck isn't restricted to MMOs imo. It also gets streamed a lot too afaik.
---
Bit of a bummer that we have to wait a month for new info, but the timing is fortuitous for me: I
---
I was planning to be in Seattle that weekend anyways visiting family, so now I'm strongly considering just adjusting my schedule to get there a day earlier, because it could be pretty cool to be there.
---
I kinda want him to drop a troll video about it, just 3 seconds long.
---
"They announced some new stuff, it looks pretty cool" and the video ends.
---
&gt; It would be fairly easy to add on and refine that to make something good and new with nominal effort
---
Without knowing how they actually set it up that may not be the case. I really hope it is, though
---
He discouraged people from it, but guess what, you cannot stop people on internet to do what they want. Unless you want to just straight disable all chats and such.
---
GW2 PvP was amazing in Year one, when only PvP people played PvP and there wasn't PvE rewards associated with it. PvE Rewards ruined PvP IMO.
---
Something something if you want a hardcore MMO go play something else. Something something we get no viewers here but also have no watchable content since everyone gets the same rations for touching the objective, something something... gear progression, something.
---
It's not called Dragon Wars 2. Dragons are a relatively new addition to the lore, retconned in after GW1.
---
They could drop this whole plot if they wanted to, especially now. Dragons are holding the entire story hostage and have never been interesting villains. It'd be a shame to waste the entire game on boring dragons.
---
model ripping from the game using a software like Ninjaripper. Not sure which tho.
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY
---
This announcement is coming the same day as the bazar of the 4 winds drops, so the community will all be mingling and talking to each other during the festival and lots of players will find out about the new info that way. It's a pretty smart move on their part there.
---
Might even have hints and NPC chatter there detailing upcoming events and story, etc.
---
OMG WHAT THIS FORGOTTEN FEELING I'M EXPERIENCING YET ONCE AGAIN.....COULD IT BE....COULD IT BE...HYPE?!
---
ff14 is a clusterfuck.
---
Hey I know a lot of people are running Dragonfall meta. Besides the drops there you can turn mistborn notes into volatile magic. Buy trophy shipments and sell those.
---
Psh, false.  
---
The rep hearts they add are going to take at least a half hour on their own~
---
6 years.
---
Cantha confirmed :D
---
What do you mean by only raid?
---
Cairn, Matthias, Cardinal Sabir, Qadim Peerless, Mursaat, Souless Horror, Dhuum
---
Mirages are top tier on all these fights.
---
Lets just not forgot that just because a game has 5k/71k of people watching it on Twitch, it doesn't mean that these same people are actually playing the game.  
---
Streaming has some benefits for games, but in general, a good amount of viewers is only good for the streamer/streaming service. For a game, you would want that 5k/71k of people playing your game, and not watching someone play it.
---
set playback speed on settings tab in youtube to .75...decent enough fix
---
*sister
---
for 500 people? not likely
---
Never seen them saying &lt;something&gt; is a  conspiracy when it's an actual fact that amazon got their developers, it's a fact that the raid teams got broken apart and moved to something else etc etc... 
---
But i guess freedom of speech doesn't apply on their forum
---
Hoping for the best but expecting nothing interesting.
---
Are home instance upgrades account-wide? If I use an upgrade with character A, is B's home also got the upgrade?
---
I wouldn't either. My complaint is them introducing it and then apparently decided it wasn't worthwhile to continue adding to. The concept of a "personal instance" that you slowly add to over the course of a season or expansion is cool you just have to be willing to actually keep up with it and ANet decided not to.
---
August 30th? Oof
---
This sounds like a "dont leave guys we're working on sth"
---
I agree. I mean, my favorite villain in the MCU is Helmut Zemo and he never once fought the heroes. I would love a villain like that in GW2. A villain that is unknown and cannot be defeated with strength of arms.
---
And this "demo area" that was datamined...
---
Did we just got bamboozled and there is new Expac coming?
---
It's funny when people say that because the only thing connecting FFXIV to any other FF game is the name.
---
And Chocobos.
---
Crafted goods are account bound, so you don't need to have more than 2 professions per character to get all of them
---
Maybe make an event where all the dev's fix wvw
---

This pic came with the newsletter so atleast snow!
---
So essentially they chose the first weekend after Classic's release.
---
Stop hitting yourself.
---
"any thing but dragons"
---
"I want to go to the Empire of the Dragon"
---
Well this is going to be a hard request to please.
---
I hope so
---
You give fury to team.
---
This is not a standard warning on the forums in fact there is none. Even by assuming you mean the generally most given warning you'd still be wrong, that's the warning about offending other people on the forums.
---
This is pretty clear censorship
---
I am happy to criticize ArenaNet, but it is simply inaccurate and unjust to attribute something written by a forum moderator to ArenaNet as a company or to the developers.
---
They are so delusional.
---
The forum moderation over there is amazing, and I don't mean it in the positive sense. They don't actually seem to read your posts or the context. It might actually be automated. I don't know, but I've actually got posts reinstated when I got beyond the copy and paste boilerplate responses, so who knows.
---
Now this is just speculation, but I imagine the reason posts get modded is usually when enough people report it enough. I can tell once since that time my post got reinstated is they initially used a reason that was parroted by the pettty d00d above my post. They claimed my post was irrelevant and a few other words and that's exactly what the mod reason was. Simply put, it's basically the work  of the Thought Police brigade out to mass report you.
---
NORVANDT CONFIRMED! We going to the first bois!
---
Nothing stopping anet writing them back in with some kind of explanation.
---
Charr (Red) versus Bubbles (Blue)? There was that talk a while back about going to the Char homelands so if they split the season between that in the first half and then dealing with the unknown Elder Dragon in the second half it could work as a bridge into the next expansion.
---
Don't feed the mentally ill troll.
---
Anet also banned the ok sign emote on their twitch channel but still have this offensive symbol on our superior runes of the monkes :(
---
See, now I want to see ANet do an announcement on March 31st just to see WP do that on April 1st. :)
---
So not only do you ride ANets dick about literally everything, you have begun asking for people you disagree with to be banned now too. That is pretty toxic bro.
---
NO IM GONNA HATE ON IT UNTIL IT MAGICALLY STOPS BEING ABOUT WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT SO THERE FUCK YOU
---
Picking a tv channel or show is definitely not the same experience. There's no interaction element, you're just watching. Even """interactive""" television (childrens shows or voting/caller shows) are broadcasted to an audience not to an individual. When you watch a stream, you're given a direct pipeline to the streamer to potentially chat with them. Larger streams are obviously a bit less personalized and vlogcasts generally stick to their agenda rather than interact with chat, but the overwhelming majority of Twitch is made up of smaller channels with that kind of engagement.
---
I don't watch stuff on Twitch, but I have read up on it and talked to people about why they do because I think it's an interest subject to observe. I might be wrong in my assertions here, but I did put in due diligence to try and understand. My personal engagement with it has pretty much been limited to trying to help friends when they start out streaming or are trying to grow their channels, but playing with them on stream is different than watching it so I don't know if that counts.
---
Also: Again, with sports you have to find a physical place and the people to play it with. You can try to hit up local fitness centers or public courts for pick up games or do some solo practice, but it is a much different experience than just alt tabbing and launching GW2 as opposed to watching it. Not to mention, as other people said in this thread, you can watch and play at the same time if you so choose.
---
You have a point that the medium and range of hobbies has grown across generations, though. I'm not saying that streaming/gaming is *less* than physical hobbies, just that there is a very different nature between them. Sometimes you want to watch, sometimes you want to play. The difference between watching and playing a video game — especially with GW2 — is just to alt tab and play it. You don't have to go anywhere, you don't have to call anyone, you don't even have to close your stream tab.
---
|freedom of speech
---
Does not mean what you think it means, evidently.
---
Hello, so maybe it's not clear enough on the post , but condi chrono will never be better than axe mirage during this patch, however it's definetly better than scepter mirage.  
---
If you take the raw benchmark, axe mirage is better on largos, but it's difficult to pull very good numbers with it, but on condi chrono it's just so easy to pull high number that make it a viable choice for this encounter!

"ANNOUNCING THE NEW EXTENDED DEV CUTS! MORE TEAM MEMBERS RELEASED THAN EVER BEFORE! LIVING STORY NOW HAS 100% PRIORITY AT GUILD WARS!"
---
-Anet, probably
---
I would pay to attend that.
---
Not even na.
---
You've have to be a complete fool to think that ANet would allow that video to remain up on their forums.
---
I'm not happy with the state of the game as much as the next person but seriously?
---
lol, ya'll are crazy.
---
Do you have proof of his firing?
---
FULL DISCLAIMER
---
THIS GUY'S POST HISTORY IS NSFL. DO NOT ENTER. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.
---
Ye it was made in Flash and had childish graphics but man, character progression, professions and the content was top notch. It was truly progressive MMO where getting max level could take years.
---
Expansion 3 basically confirmed?  How are we doing emails going out, Anet looking for people to come test in-house again, its been about the time in between HoT-PoF, LS wrapped up and ready for a new season, and probably more I'm forgetting.
---
I hope we get something exciting.  End-game content that's not running around a new PvE map for an hour before leaving for two months.  WvW content that isn't a mount that kills roaming and any hope of bringing in new players.  PvP content that actually exists.  You know Anet heard us loud and clear over the past week.  They didn't reply to any of the threads on here but as soon as the guy posted about how he works next to Anet's offices, they chimed in and posted.  Don't let us down, Anet!
---
it's a possibility. they said something about living story including "expansion-like features" a while back, as vague as that is. i am cautiously optimistic.
---
I have no idea who Nike is, and I'd never bother to look him/her/they up.
---
I will now, just to see what the fuss is about, so Nike, if you're reading this, congratulations on the free publicity! :)
---
I'm fairly certain that mounts are done. They were a PoF/S4 thing. Anet's most likely going to pop a new feature for S5.
---
Gotta keep the hate train going then? Are you that afraid it's going to simmer down with today's news about news in 6 weeks?
---
You can sell them if you don’t need them. The high value is due to them having all selectable stats.
---
They did mention season 5 would incorporate some expansion-like content. So they'll probably show off some neat things.
---
Because that's not abuse-able *at all*.
---
Was it really? Because Youtube has a feature that lets you upload a livestream as a video after the broadcasting ends, which would explain that.
---
Minus points for making assumptions I guess.
---
Does't make my point any less relevant.
---
Fastest upvoter in the wild west.
---
quite a few directions possible so I could see that, Primordis vs Jormag, Primordis vs Bubbles, Charr vs Bubbles, can't see any way to link red to norn so I doubt Norn vs Jormag.
---
Or it could be a huge red (and blue) herring and be something totally different.
---
Its really not unique. FF forums apparently have shit ban-happy moderation. Runescape 100% does. I think WoW has ok moderation but I'm not sure.
---
Praise Joko
---
Yeah 28 US Raiders pulling up in black Raptor Mounts
---
Skyscales landed
---
Raid Ranch is under seige under lockdown
---
Most of the content since the layoffs were well underway? Season 5 will likely be the first time we see ANY content that's been pipelined since then. The results aren't immediate.
---
I wanted to comment this on his video... but no account.  
---
      
---
Nike's video lost me when he turned HoT into an elite vs casual debate... HoT's biggest issue was overpromising/expectations and how little content we actually got. That's not a player skill problem...     
---
       
---
I had no issues w/ difficulties, just the amount of underwelming content we got in the "expansion" at launch. Only 4 maps (one of them unusable outside of a meta), a short broken story, 0 fractals/dungeons, and bunch of other broken promises. 
---
Don't forget we got almost 0 content for months leading into HoT, so what were they doing during that time? Saving up content to release it as a bundle a year later and call it an expansion? How many raid wings were available at launch? How easy was it to LFG for raids? How many Legendaries did we get at launch? How amazing was the mastery system? and how great did it feel to unlock masteries like Nuhock Lore? How accesible were Guild Halls and decorations? How many new PvP gametypes did we get? Should I even mention WvW?

In summary: over promise and under delivery. For whatever reason, content delivery has been the biggest problem for ANET since launch of GW2.       
---
   
---
Is ANET even capable of delivering content at a regular pace? I honestly don't care what, any content is welcome at this point. QoL and Balance Patches are great but please give me actual content. I just want something new to do.
---
Not just that, but a dev (I believe it was Tom Abernathy?) said explicitly that they were NOT going to be doing the sort of world-ending stuff again like they did with Kralkatorrik. Because obviously, that would be insane. I don't think he meant no elder dragons, but we wouldn't see more "OMG the dragons are eating the multiverse!" stuff again.
---
Not necessarily so they can keep giving us mounts - though I believe one or two more aren't entirely out of the question - but also so they can keep giving us /mount areas/. If S5 is followed by an expac, and that one follows the same schematic they've used so far, then this season is the last season in which they can aggressively design maps around mounts. After that, maps have to be friendlier to mount-less players once again.
---
Don't forget that a forum moderator's job is different from a designer's job.
---
I do not know if the moderators are actual ArenaNet team members or not, but even if calling this "ArenaNet's response" is technically correct, it is also misleading.
---
Beach epsode?
---
It really depends on what you’re doing. If you’re running a Firebrand or Renegade healer, then Pack Runes wouldn’t be a bad idea to get better Fury uptime for your subgroup. If your focus is on healing, Monk Runes are by far and away the best in the game, but if you absolutely need a temporary budget alternative, then I would just use Water Runes. Cheap to acquire and they give a little boost to your healing and boon duration. 
---
Still, try to get Monk Runes ASAP. If dungeons aren’t your thing, use PvP and WvW reward tracks, or if you did SAB and purchased exchange vouchers you could get the currency that way too.
---
It needs to be something fresh as the current release cadance and content model is not working, and also come with a solid roadmap of what they actually want their game to be going into the next season and beyond.

---
Down vote the OP to the shadow realm and let me regain my glory.
---
I don't understand what this is supposed to prove. Watching content for a game is completely different from actually playing a game, so this doesn't mean a whole lot in terms of GW's health. Also if I had to guess, the people watching twitch and the people playing GW2 probably don't intersect very much.
---
At this point, are there even more than 500 GW2 fans attending PAX?
---
It depends on who is under NDA, if he is under NDA he is at breach for mentioning it. If it was an inside source that told him they broke NDA when they told him and him mentioning it put them at risk that with Anet.
---
Not getting someone in trouble seems like a convenient way to say he telling the truth with nothing to back it up. Why should we take his word over Anet's word? Conspiracy theories?
---
I joined the raid training discord e half of the groups wanted gear check.
---
super easy, barely an inconvenience
---
Why would he share his sources to the general public? That would entirely ensure that industry insiders stop working with him entirely.
---
Hmm, tinfoil theory but considering that they have been doing a lot of expack features in the ls segments what if Season 5 is a living story version of an expack? Like totally new content that you explore more of through living story segments with expack features like new specializations.
---
ok this comment just killed me
---
Not true at all. Most gemstore chairs have a different sitting animation.
---
ANET PLEASE!!!
---
That really looks like a surprise announcement to me. 45 minutes to say that the living world is coming ? If they're introducing tons of new features with it for free it wouldn't really make sense. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they announced a new expansion, behind all that "season 5 is coming after season 4!" speech they've been spamming everywhere. I hope, at least. Anyway if that's only for living world season 5, they have to announce big things about it, because 45 minutes is really long.
---
This has happened a lot in the last week. Groups doing Gear checks and asking for multiple legendary insight and dps meters.
---
It's never been locked behind anything. Yes some groups are more strict than others but most Iv joined have been reasonable especially if you as a player are honest and do know what you're doing.
---
Most of the negative atmosphere around raids are due to a very small number of the raid community in general and due to very rare instances such as yours (being kicked for having an exo).
---
All I can suggest is you keep trying and keep checking lfg (I see raid trains for multiple wings everyday on EU (ik NA may differ)). And if you have the kp and li, as others have said, try joining a 100li sq and seeing what happens. IV often let 60li people enter a 200li and if they genuinely arnt holding us back everyone is cool with it. Just don't let one or two bad experiences change ur mind over an entire game mode and jump to conclusions cos we have enough of those people already.
---
I wonder if new Aurene has the power to reverse the Foefire..
---
Why would you take his word as fact? [I also have source at Anet that says he wasn't fired.](https://de.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/48zlyd/im_mike_obrien_here_with_gw2_dev_team_ama/)
---
you will recieve a small paper card with a gemstore code. you will receive an ingame swag bag including a dye kit, a hairstyling kit and a scarf to keep you warm in the winter while you wait for season 5.
---
rune of the flock is really good.
---
I used it for a bit on my firebrand in wvw while working on monk runes. i would drop a 2.5k heal with my heal mantra every 10sec.
---
so id definitely say it is a decent alternative.
---
 And what happened, then? Well, in r/Guildwars2 they say – that the Grinch’s small heart grew three sizes that day.  And then – the true meaning of Guild Wars came through, and the Grinch found the strength of ten Grinches, plus two!
---
I dont really see them hire accountants :(
---
Oh, you got me with that title. I thought you had a trick we could do in-game to make the Skimmer better on land. But instead it was just a suggestion post.
---
They also could have lied about it being only for living world. It's always surprised me that for more than a year they're saying everywhere "season 5 comes straight after season 4!" knowing people will be sad there's no expansion in between, they've kinda killed people's hype for a long time. I wouldn't be surprised if they come up saying that it's actually an expansion. 45 minutes is a very long time, so it has to be something big, esp if it's also live.
---
Actually is not. Yesterday's broadcast also had the Anet partner 'Angeels' saying that Colin was fired and anet was fluffing about him leaving. eesh
---
If you are new to raiding and don’t have much killproof or legendary insights, I would suggest only joining training groups or those open to newcomers. Learning the raid on the fly is difficult and can hamper the rest of the group, who probably do not expert a beginner to be playing with them. 
---
Even if you do join a training group it’s best to try to learn the fight and have good gear first. This will make the process much smoother overall. 
---

Finally
---
Love how I got downvoted for asking a simple question. 
---
Your answer is great though. Resolution is max, smaller ui it is.
---
ok thanks for the suggestion!  
---
Regarding to that, i've already opened a ticket about the issue, and yes i tried selecting other countries which worked besides romania :o ! hope it might get fixed before sales \^.\^/
---
you do you but I'm done defending Anet, and so far Anet hasn't given me any reason not to believe the rumors that come up every now and again (and quite a few of them line up with things I hear from other people I talk to in the industry)
---
I was moderated for saying that all living story NPC vendors sold the same types things and it felt lazy. Was a while ago back when every living story NPC was ascended trinkets and mini pets.
---
&gt; WvW
---
  
---
...or a stream with a X minutes delay because of how the game mode works, that causes streamer-viewer relation to be annoying.
---
I want buy FF today. But with this news i think can wait until august :3
---
I mean, he wasn’t wrong. It got a little better, but PvE pre HoT was an absolute joke.
---
Salut! if i had my money not already in my paysafe account i would've done that but i didnt know before and now im not aware of a method to safely transfer money from PSC to Paypal
---
i would like to have some banana q
---
My only concern up to this point was the fear that the next season of living worlds would slowly die out and the game would end there. If they are going this far to have a live event, this seems to be on the scale of an expansion (like they have said). I am super excited and can’t wait considering whatever big news they announce will probably release within a week of that point.
---
Can everyone stop talking about it as "conspiracy theory".  
---
Until it's officially stated  
---
Arenanet forum moderators are just trying to hide it and escape from criticism.  
---
Mods can't know everything.
---
Ah, that's why they buffed core guard and core necro, to make sure the new specs look good
---
Wait
---
Salvage, toss in mystic forge or sell on tp.
---
It improved massively with raids and the CM fracs we got.
---
so nike is a trashy attention-whore that spews nonsense ranging from: outright factually wrong information, stolen builds to which he adds the DnT tag(and somehow makes them worse), misconceptions, 10-15min videos in which he says literally nothing of importance and..apparently now conspiracy theories
---
yea, the forum moderators might be rather draconic at times but you can't just stir up drama out of nowhere..can you? of course you can if you're nike_dnt!
---
It is no person or company's resposibility to respond to any random claim thrown at them. The onus is on the accuser to actually prove their claims.
---
There's fractals and raids, but difficulty is nowhere close to mythic in wow. The most difficult part of gw2 pve are teammates, not the content.
---
Condi mirage is still good (I still play as one). If you only stopped because you didn't have time to keep up, you'll probably have a bit of content to work through and some collections to do, if you want the new skins or mounts.
---
If you want a power build, you can do Chrono. Or there's a lot of other power builds you can try depending on what kind of play style you're looking for
---
Dear god me too. Boo hiss
---
I look forward to your followup doom post about how what they showed wasn't enough / wasn't what you wanted
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBNXbxZGxw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvBNXbxZGxw)  
---
Realistically speaking we cannot trust both sides. Still, I blame ANet for lack of communication, that breed all sorts of rumours in the first place.
---
what datamine are you talking about? Can't find it on the subreddit
---
try a different browser maybe?  I just tested it, and it worked instantly for me.
---
Yes, I'm sure they booked a room at PAX West yesterday because they saw a memer was threatening to take his toys home e\_e
---
Do wvw events get bigger than like 100+people doing a world event? Cuz aside from some fps drop I don't get any of the skill lag being discussed here. Occasionally if I try to mount the second I load a zone it takes a second for the mount to load but even huge events run smoothly.
---
Loving the recent updates! Thank you so much for picking this up again!
---
To add to the excitement, it’s possible the whole company will be dedicated to Living World. Before, it was mostly to my assumption split between expansion/LS. Obviously it’s possible that’s still the case but who knows. With season five we may get faster/bigger updates or the whole structure might change.
---
Ah kk. Thanks for clearing it up. I may have overreacted to seeing a condi chrono build have such high confusion stacks.
---
Do you have a source? I'm legitimately curious. Everyone making allegations with no sources. I'm not saying you're wrong but I'm not saying that Nike and Angeels is wrong either. I'm just really curious.
---
His site had grown unstable and was finally removed from the gw2wiki.
---
The gw2spidy author is not very active in gw2 anymore and didn't react to the server issuers for a while.  I let him know about issues as did many others who prefer his site.  He decided to invest a bit of time, money in the gw2spidy server (if you read the small popup). After noticing the gw2spidy hadn't returned to the wiki I email the spidy author a few days ago.
---
TLDR:  Spidy author contacted gw2 wiki recently after fixing the aged server.
---
lol.
---
**Revive [F]**
---

---
Supporters really dont need ascended (its better, sure, but not necessary). So make a druid, a healscourge, a healrenegade and you are ready to go.
---
DPS are more maintenance, but well.. you dont have to play dps.
---
Chronotank is fine in exotic givers with water runes as well.
---
It's a step in the right direction, but don't get on the hype train so soon. I'd rather wait and see whats coming, cause if it's just another regular living world season, things won't get any better.
---
I mean this sub did literally beg for communication and when to expect ls5 lol
---
&gt;It needs to be something fresh as the current release cadance and content model is not working
---
Actually I doubt this is the case at all. I feel like it's only "not working" for a small percentage of the playerbase (primarily the people who visit this sub) and that GW2 overall would be completely fine with another season just like season 4, as indicated by reasonably healthy financial quarterly reports.
---
Everyone: geam ded, Anet sucks, wehhhh gimme attention 
---
Anet: does a wiggle 
---
Everyone: MOTHERFUCKING HYPE!!!!
---
I'm hyped because for the first time since 2015, they are having a live presentation.
---
I'm not commenting at all on the content. I'm just saying that what ANET is doing is ballsy, and I respect that confidence a lot.
---
He said repeteadly he won't post any major spoilers, at least not directly.
---
It may sound like I'm needlessly bitching you. Yet I genuinely have no other way to say it, so you'll just have to work with me in good faith when I'm saying: you people are too easily swayed. In both ways.
---
It's not like I'm not thrilled, but that's just some superficial fun. To address any of my concerns, they'll have to show off their stuff first. And I strongly advise you to temper your expectations. They may blow our minds, they may showcase another "no content lol gg anet u sux ded gaem" Living World maps and a bunch of elite specs.
---
I’m guessing a pack of 3 maps starting the season off. Also I doubt they’re going to go into detail about each spec.
---
GW2 and WoW Classic couldn't be more different tho.
---
I am completely new to Raids, and today I mustered to courage to put into LFG "Vale Guardian and Grosevalt, newb raider looking for help. Playing condi scourge". My group got filled in like 2-3 mins and we went to thrash Vale Guardian with no issue.
---
ive never seen a single group in raid academy do a gear check
---
Down vote and report this OP beyond the shadow realm.
---
i mean sure, it's something... but getting "hyped" because of the announcement of an announcement? come on...

Heh, no wonder. Well, pretty sure there are still some for you to join, even though they're thinning.

#love4arenanet
---
Remembering some guildchats... 45 minutes doesnt have to say anything. I stay doom.
---
Enlighten what's the entirely new UI, and why would they test anything as a WvW event?
---
Sorry dude but reddit is no different xD
---
No, this build gets bad really really quickly as soon as the attack speed drops
---
Frickin fickle. 
---
This community has the memory of a goldfish and the patience of a 2 year old. Content has always come in waves, and we've never **not** gotten some big announcement and some big changes/patch/expansion at the end of it. It's positively insane to me how fast this subreddit turned into a full "daed game" memefest.
---
OMEGALUL we are not censoring, we are merely altering messages and user experience
---
For anyone that needs a further explanation, Arenanet is removing Nike's video "how did we get here" from their forums and in the process calling it a non factual conspiracy theory. The video got a large amount of support on reddit when it was initially posted. ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/chd1tf/how_did_we_get_here/ )
---
peepoClown HONK HONK peepoClown FURNACE TAKEN peepoClown HONK HONK peepoClown
---
This degenerate gets it. *Salute, from a fellow degenerate*.
---
WvW alliances, elite specs/dual profession, and a pack of three maps would be amazing
---
soo, do you think if the  'colin got fired' (which is openly contradicting official ANet info) part wasn't there, the video would've passed? or is there something more?
---
this
---
As soon as you add Auto-ban, people will find a way to exploit it against people they don't like.
---
I see three things this could be.
---
1. More Living World episodes like those we've always had, but 45 minutes is basically how long it takes to show off and spoil the entirety of one episode so they won't do that. It'll in this case likely be multiple episodes showcase so people have more things to look forward to. 
---
2. Living World is reworked, fewer but larger episodes per year. I'm thinking maybe once every six months or so. Perhaps they'll even pay-wall it, like 15 USD an episode or something. However, they've already mentioned they don't feel like they have to include a new zone every episode if they can deliver a good experience in an existing one or otherwise expand upon an existing zone, but I don't think you could effectively expect people to pay money for content in this game if they're NOT getting a new zone... If they want Living world to be the only thing going forward instead of expansions, a model like this is likely what we'll end up with however. Fewer, meatier episodes. 
---
3. More Living World episodes like those we've always had, but with a "There's one more thing we have to announce... Because I bet you're all asking the question, what's after this season of living world?" and then a quick expansion announcement which really only needs to be a logo and a name.
---
So what would you take instead of mirror images on an actual fight (say, largos)?
---
&gt;you people are too easily swayed. In both ways.
---
It's not "swayed" or anything.
---
ANET is being confident for once since HoT. I respect that a lot.
---
I buy 500 exotics every day, i love the new update, thx!!!!
---
There was hints at us going north in the Dragon Bash festival, wasn't there? And I am not talking about the festival being in Hoelbrak; I am talking about the dialogue from that one "friendly" Icebrood.
---
some people really think that upgrading servers is literally just pressing the upgrade key on the machine, like what the fuck
---
For the record I didn't say that Colin was fired. I said that Nike likely did his research so its a possibility, but I have seen no evidence for it, so can't comment on it. 
---
Unfortunately, Crushy is an interesting person and has somewhat of an agenda against myself and others in the Twitch scene and wants to try and take stuff that I have earned like Anet Partnership.
---
I remember dying once, and I'm not even ashamed. That fight got the jump on me, I did NOT expect that kind of clusterfuck exploding into my face. It was a Living World boss, for the love of God!
---
To be clear this is not a post complaining about forum moderation, in fact the victim was not even me. I'm simply exposing the message ArenaNet has towards Nike's video.
---
It's a live presentation. Not some silly guild chat where Rubi talks fluff for 45 minutes. (Nothing personal to Rubi since that's their job.)
---
cruhshy111:

''The posts in here supporting this conspiracy theory of Anet employees being 'fired' when instead they had left is being done openly on MightyTeapot's stream. They told a 400 viewer stream to come here and upvote this thread because was being 'downvoted too much'. The individuals doing this openly in voice comms on MightyTeapot's stream some are even official Anet partners which is questionable. hahaha Anet partners people who flame them openly and incite a mob to upvote on Gw2's subreddit blatant slander of a past employee.

Yesterday as well had 'Angeels' in voice coms suggesting in front of 600+ viewers that Colin was fired (which is slander) and is an ArenaNet partner? A bit odd.''

It is a conspiracy theory though. It's 15 minutes of sweaty neet conjecture. He keeps implying intentions with zero fucking backup for anything.

"Anet clearly doesn't care anymore"

"Anet doesn't give a shit"

Thats what i meant with "a few k less" :) I meant a few K less than mirage
---
So you're saying basically useable only on twin Largos? ok got it
---
I wouldn't want a "surprise gotcha" villain, but I do think we need a more human-level threat. The Caudacus arc is about the right level. He had a wealth of minions, motive, and the threat of national impact (and beyond once the Lazarus/Balthazar plot opened up).  The threat of breaking the tentative peace between the current city-states is probably bigger than a unifying threat like an elder dragon.

Ah, okay, I keep looking through my current install and can't figure out what keeps track of which marker packs I've turned off (or like the collections were it removes the marker when you interact with the object how it remembers which markers not to reload next time I turn it on), I figured it had to be storing that somewhere I just can't find it lol
---
even if it could do that, people would still be using raptor, jackal or rollerbeetle instead, because they'd still be faster on land. and on top of that it'd feel super awkward to go from superspeed while holding space back to slo-mo speed when endurance is empty.
---
skimmer is niche and it's fine the way it is. we don't need 7 high-speed mounts.

HoT was revealed on a live floor. It was promoted very differently than PoF.
---
If that video was made (100% the same)by WP or Teapot or any other big name creator it would get the same treatment. Anything that can be interpreted as negativity about gw2, the official forums, the company w/e it all gets squashed for silly reasons. Nike comes off alot of the time as a giant douche canoe so its hard to listen to anything he says with out him sounding a negative asshole (even when he makes a good point), which is something the official forums dont like.
---
...we got living world maps and mounts. Eh.
---
Oof sounds like you might have joined groups that were looking for "experienced" people.

Here we are. I have become a clairvoyant.
---
wow that'll show 'em! impressive work you do here!
---
i bet anet and the mods are shaking in fear right now
---
My take on this build is different. It shows that even condi chrono is broken by design.
---
Imagine if condi weaver or condi soulbeast were only usable on a handful of encounters, with the DPS falling off a cliff everywhere else. Would that be a hint of a badly designed class? 
---
Apparently it's totally normal and expected for chrono.
---
&gt; According to ArenaNet the community's concerns about the game are "non-factual conspiracy theories", which should be suppressed and censored.
---
but isn't that correct? Nike didnt cite any source for anything he said in the video so they are mostly non-factual
---
dude, get a life
---
I... I don't know...
---
He didn't because it's not complaint about warning/ban.  
---
It's just showing a response about criticism.
---
Wow, that's quality clothing!
---
You're misunderstanding. People's opinions haven't changed.
---
No one was saying GW2 was dead. They were saying it has abandoned its hardcore playerbase
---
An expansion (or in this case, a LS5 revealed similarly to an expansion) is an opportunity to fix things.
---
Thank you, thank you!   &lt;3
---
I'm not friends with either but nike is the one making the claims and with the current hysteria going around here people are more likely to want to believe it, when we should be skeptical.
---
It could be true or could not but unless he can back it up, why should it be believed?
---
A lot of people on here and the internet as a whole have a bias of how things are want to believe whatever fits that and will ignore the truth, this reddit very much has that on all side both for and against anet, you'll see just as many people claim that redditors are kiss asses as do claim they are haters. I wanted to look at this objectively, this thread started of with premise that anet are censoring criticism with overzealous forum mods, so I checked it out on whether it is just censoring or the reason they gave is right. After checking out the video I heard him state "Colin was fired" when the current status quo was that he left for another company, sounds like conspiracy theories to me, if there is proof to nike's claim and the video was removed for that reason, it is censorship from overzealous mods, if it isn't true then the mods removed it for a good reason.
---
Do you know why he isn't banned yet?
---
yes it does about: 3= complaining/posting about forums bans/warnings or also prohibited.
---
Housing would be a dream, something to do and take care of this late in the game. Also, they can use mechanics from guild halls/suns refuge nicely.

Let me guess, other post removed because your desperately trying to stir up drama?
---
For the former, I have absolutely no idea. I’ve just been seeing other people mention it with the latest WvW update. For the latter, I believe we will see some sort of content drop (sort of mini expansion) within the week of the August 30th announcement. Pure speculation though. ANET has known about season five for a while now, over a year. Also with four full teams working on LW releases, the pace of content is going to be different than we’ve seen before. The most I think we’ve heard of is three as of yet. If they had four teams with their current pace, that would mean each release would require a year to make. Also I highly doubt ANET would make a huge announcement and say (assuming the release will happen close to the announcement) hey jump into this one single map in a new region with all these new features (some new feature like fishing). Something more like, jump into our largest LS episode ever and drop a pack of 3 maps in the far northern shiverpeaks. If season five is going to be more similar to an expansion, you have to include some larger amount of story/maps at some point or at a faster pace. Along these lines, I’m expecting some form of LW season pass that will be sold.
---
Lol same same
---
Maybe that means we can expect some stage 1 / pre-event / current event update to come with the four winds? I saw posts of people wondering what will happen with the Zephyrites now that Aurene has more or less ascended to being an elder dragon so hopefully this plays along that story line a bit!
---
I'm really curious because it's unlikely they just pushed those assets to the retail client by accident, but that doesn't necessarily mean we should expect them to be utilized soon.

the server comment reminded me how lack of servers really can kill a game.
---
Wolfpack Studios developed a game called Shadowbane which was highly heralded back in the day. Unfortunately, they needed a publisher for funding and chose UbiSoft who had never stepped foot in the MMO market at the time. They had like 4 servers in Canada (no joke) and at launch you couldn't even move. Within a week about 75-80% of the players straight up quit, never to come back by the time they had addressed it.
---
Can you give enemies quickness?
---
We need more difficult end game content tbh
---
The real question is what is being depicted on the LS logo? One part obviously is a person.

well that kinda conflicts with what you said earlier:
---
&gt; If the DPS pulls 40% of what they should they are like... Alacren levels?
---
&gt; That means support aint buffing or they deserve the kick :)
---
Most pug DH players are in that 40-60% range.
---
Not happening unless you're willing to share it with casuals.
---
"Like what? Like what could they improve??" "Like what?? I don't understaaaaand"
---
Are you having a fucking laugh?
---
How about:
---
1. How line of vision work and the fact that how clunky it is makes the game feel 15 years older than it is
---
2. The fact that *everything* has a cast time (a long ass cast time for most of it) which completely removes the possibility to implement gameplay that is based on having any kind of good reactions
---
3. Or how about starting with not randomly getting stuck *inside* of walls or objects
---
Like...I don't know. Maybe you've never played another game in your life before. 
---
But even then you'd have to shit out your brains to not find anything that could be improved (and *needs* to be, if it doesn't want to be left behind by its competition in coming years.
---
Sorry, my friend, but "I'm a complacent, ignorant idiot" isn't an argument for Anet not needing to improve
---
I hope they bring back the vanilla GW2 character select screen.  I'm sick of the dessert.
---
LOL That was wonderfully silly! &lt;3

If you can do raids, you can solo Caudecus Manor.

Open an LFG and you'll get parties for all paths in relatively little time. Specially now that we have a respite between events an festivals. In 2-3 days you'll get enough for 6 runes, less if you don't skip bosses and they drop form chests.
---
What's wrong with humans?
---
I mean convinient wise.
---
Legendaries are all about convinient (and shiny skins), but this solution brings even more clicks and even more vexations, if you forget to switch it back after logging out. Then you have to switch between chars and search for it. 
---
All in all you have to pay attention to make this solution work and that's not the goal. I mean yes, you could safe some gold because you need less backpacks, but a legendary is not there to safe gold.
---
Sure, it's abuse-able, but trolls and people ruining competitive game modes get to keep doing so for months and years without penalties.
---
They are now.
---
As a Floridian whose car takes 20 minutes to cool down i'll just take any temperature under 70F please. I'd ask for snow but considering how bad drivers are here when it rains, snow would probably burn the entire state to the ground in car fires. Though honestly that might be an improvement.
---
I like how  you give advice on proof reading yet dont have strong contextual reading skills.
---
I'm going to be stuck at work...
---
What do you mean?
---
&gt;No, community does not fkin desperately need anything. Only few doomers, some of them shy enough to create throwaway just to spread chaos.
---
First of all, isn't this descending into conspiracy theory? People have legitimate grievances of the game. Just because you disagree with them doesn't mean they are "spreading chaos". People are allowed to have different opinions.
---
Second of all, it's none of your business why anybody uses a throwaway account. Absolutely none of your business.
---
We just got an awesome season finale with lucrative meta map, balance patch that actually fixed stuff (people stopped complaining now when SC stuffed them with benchmarks, truth in face yo), we got not one but three legendary items (gs, rings, accesory) and runes next week. We got a festival that was held only once before.
---
So are you being rhetorical or are you genuinely wondering why people are not happy? 
---
Now, I'm not saying you have to agree with what I'm about to explain, but I'll try to explain their point of view:
---
&gt;We just got an awesome season finale with lucrative meta map
---
People are unsatisfied because the new map meta didn't bring any legitimate challenge. 
---
The story instances themselves felt like a snooze fest to most people, and horribly undertuned. It's understandable that not everyone is good at GW2, and no one is saying casuals shouldn't be able to finish the story. But there aren't difficulty settings to keep people entertained with the encounters.
---
Story, graphics, presentation aside: the instances played like pure horse shit. And I know that sounds kinda harsh. But I'm talking as a fellow game designer here. If you strip the story from Living Story, what kind of gameplay is left?  
---
People were extremely disappointed with Ep6 because so many high budget assets were wasted on content so boring that they play it once and never again. Again, that sounds harsh, but that's the reality. (How many times have you repeated the Ep6 storyline for fun?)
---
&gt;balance patch that actually fixed stuff
---
Yes, PvP has seen some much needed updates.
---
However, WvW was still not addressed. Boon corrupt on Scourge is still upsetting players, and the One-Shot Rev Hammer \#2  is still a major balance issue.
---
The balance patch also introduced new issues. Most Chronomancer mains were disappointed with the changes to shatters, for example. Yes, although it introduced a neat condi build, the Chronomancer changes also took away a lot of its tricks with Continuim Split. The lack of Distortion was also a massive nerf, not just for raids, but PvP, and WvW. Very few vocal members of the community are happy with the Chronomancer changes.
---
&gt;we got not one but three legendary items (gs, rings, accesory)
---
We look forward to more. However, new legendary trinkets don't exactly address people's grievances with the game right now.
---
Some people were disappointed that they would not obtain the effect of Coalesence unless they crafted all 3 legendary rings. Especially since raiders have so much pride in their identity as raiders. They love to show off their Matthias Staff, their legendary armors, etc... So it was disappointing not to get Coalesence unless you had Vision and Aurora. 
---
Also keep in mind that the inability to craft more than one Coalesence took a big hit to replayability in raids. One of the biggest incentives to raid was the fact you needed 600 LI for second and third legendary armor sets. But Coalesence had no such thing.
---
The bottomline however to keep in mind is that legendaries are not content. Some just have a small fetch quest, like Vision. But those are ultimately very small in terms of actual content. It's not stimulating to run up to a checklist item and press F. 
---
What legendaries effectively accomplish is stimulate the economy based on the materials required. Which is still very nice, and need to be added to the game. But it's not engaging content that people wanted.
---
&gt;We got a festival that was held only once before.
---
Very few people complain about Dragon Bash. It was cute seeing it again.
---
&gt;Now we have an announcement of an announcement and Doomkids evolved into Hypekids, like some rare pokemon with unusual evolving method.
---
People are allowed to have nuanced opinions. We're not just usernames on the internet.
---
My internet stalls out sometimes and, for a brief second, I thought it was going to be [Everybody Ought to Have a Raid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahqu1nd3Zu8)
---
If you have cash to spare and you want it as a collectible to keep on your shelves, yes.
---
If you want any actual useful information, use the wiki.
---
This is completely wrong. Guild Halls could be used if they would offer something to the individual player. Resources that could e harvested were a good attempt but we need a lot more than that...
---
It's still 2600 gold without the bank access. 
---
&gt; If you don't count the bank then the cost of an upgrade extractor is much cheaper. And think that if you have legendary weapons/armor you don't even need the extractor since you can replace sigils/runes/infusions freely.
---
You can replace them freely, but you still need to have them in your inventory.
---
That'd be too good.
---
Ah, you're probably thinking of the Core Swap WvW event - I think how poorly that went is a pretty good indicator of some of the problems something similar on a larger scale could cause.
---
As for the maps, it's worth noting that, if they've any common sense, they won't have all four teams working on LW episodes all the time. more likely, at any given time two or three teams will be working on LW stuff, and one or two will be working on PvP or WvW or some other content like a Festival. Beyond that, I certainly like the idea of what you're getting at, but the end result isn't really a LW season unless they can follow up - having three maps for the first episode but just one for any that come after just makes E1 into a mini-expansion, with the added risk of setting a standard for future maps that ANet can't maintain.
---
If it were up to me, I would use their new resource distribution to ensure that at least the first three or four episodes of S5 come out as close together as possible. The delays in S4 were a major issue, and it would definitely be worth ANet's while to make a point of returning to form going forward. Get an episode out September, November, January and March with a Festival between each, setting a cadence that they can hopefully sustain going forward. A season pass of some sort certainly isn't outside the realm of possibility, particularly considering they don't have the influx of cash from an expansion, but considering ANet's monetisation history I would imagine that it would be some sort of early access program at most, rather than a paid LW season that is essentially a subscription in everything but name.
---
That you have a shitty and narrow view of balance
---
Even in PvE during those world boss rush events. People's skills would completely become unresponsive.
---

I just want a physics/inertia-based slowdown when you hit land, em rather than an instant speed down.  Then, small pieces of land wouldn’t really matter if you were already going fast; you could keep your speed up over them.

Fair enough. I am in no position to make any judgements.

They're unveiling elite specs in lw
---
Idk, but maybe I should have said "I stay neutral".

I really hope that's true. I'm over the dragon stuff
---
No where does he say it's more active than usual.
---
The cruelty.
---
It's not even the lack of challenging content.
---
It's simply because the CMs for Wing 7 were a joke. If they were Dhuum CM level then it'd never have happened.
---
adding elite specs to ls , but they're in the gem store. we get new elite specs, it's your choice to buy them or not, piece by piece, and since they're gem store, gold to gems is an option.
---
After some research I found a footnote under [Snaff](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Snaff). "Second apprentice."
---
But not even slightly as long as the Wooden Potatoes video about it.
---
They just have waaay more substance than the other races, mostly owing to the original game. On top of that we've had two lw seasons and an expansion in a row revolving around human lore. Sylvari (no development post-HoT), charr and especially norn have had a criminal lack of lore development however.
---
JFC everyone is so concerned about this dude feeling some excitement. come on...

Noooo ....I hate snowy maps :(

Elona, where we pursued a human god and talked to the local humans about their faith and betrayal while also working with a local human resistance group fighting against an undead human lich who ran a human empire that he took over 200ish years ago when a different human god was killed in the human lands.
---
Seriously, if Traehearne talking a lot in the PS meant it was a Sylvari story like so many people claim, then PoF and LS4 were enough human story to last us forever.

Oh, I was asking sankurix about his packs. But thanks in advance for you doing it to yours too.

You must've had a lot of time freed up lately. You've been killing it with the TacO updates.
---
My only problem are the dyes in legendary armor and the fact we can't skin the trinkets. The fact you're paying 1600+g for a trinket you cant even skin or use in different alts at the same time really stinks.
---
I think the stat swap thing will be well integrated with build templates, or so I hope.
---
Hopefully we get to fight Drakkar. Been waiting for that since 2007.
---
Yeah, 7% of it, for all but five minutes. I know what you're talking about, I did dungeons in green gear at lvl37 and my arse still burns. And I vividly remember Orr pre nerf. But that doesn't change anything. Enemies got nerfed into the ground before release, the only "challenging" world boss was the Fire Elemental, dungeons survived like three months in their original state (and never made it in their concept form anyway), and the overwhelming, vast majority of the game being as simple as it is today. GW2 being hardcore was a hiccup that got reversed in the opposite almost instantly.
---
There was a teaser?
---
Preempted, as always, by WP saying that the trailer doesn't show much and this will be a short video.
---
:( it’s true
---
clickbait.
---
Exotics are fine for raids. I would suggest that you find a guild that runs training sessions since those people would be more lenient.
---
Except PoF gave us borderline 0 new lore. We saw human NPCs and buildings. That's about how deep into the plot we went.
---
Elona had minimal impact on how things turned out. Karlky could've went to any part of the world and it would've played out the same. 
---
Anet doesn't know what to do with the world, everything has to be about dragons..
---
CM+T4+ recs around 20+ gold. Pretty much all money from opening Fractal Boxes.

There is also way too much trash things, and "box-in-box-in-box things".

I'd be interested in hearing what the two mounts you've got in mind are. Underwater is one I know a lot of people suggest but I can't think of another niche.

This is seriously impressive. Well done :D
---
It is new. It was purple for Season 4.
---
&gt; if it's just another regular living world season
---
The launch of S5 *has* to have expansion like features in it or its gonna be a huge flop. If they're gonna drop expansions then this patch has to be on par or better than a expansion launch patch.
---
There's a female norn talking about hearing Jormag. Pretty heavy foreshadowing.
---
Warframe forums can be an echo chamber safe space but at least their Community Managers interact with the community on all other social media platforms.
---
Because Icebrood Claymore has been a generic NPC enemy since 2012. That specific Icebrood Claymore in Hoelbrak was added this year during Dragon Bash.
---
Announcement is on a friday. Tuesday afterwards release, let's go.
---
Man, *you have no idea how much I'm HAPPY right now.* I remember writing a long time ago that I want Jormag as the next great villain, and that I hope Jormag freezes all of Tyria. Etc.

They are 100% teasing him.

More seriously (not that above is wrong): As said by others, the logo itself hasn't changed since Season 1; they've only changed the coloring, for Season 4 and now 5.
---

(you can right click on a video to timestamp it)
---
Blue color, harpoon on the bottom left...
---
The icon hasn't changed since Season 1. They merely turned it from black to purple (S4) to red and blue (S5).
---
I would totally love if pistol skill #1 could change when having 2 pistols equipped, maybe going full power with an extra shot between each hit, but losing the bleeding effect, so p/d would stay condi and p/p would mean power.
---
That's the Icebrood Claymore general mob article, they're talking about a specific Icebrood Claymore within Hoelbrak.
---
Season 3 primarily dealt with the White Mantle and Krytan politics. Path of Fire and Season 4 primarily dealt with Elonian politics.
---
Rainbow Phoenix colors (pet of original GW)?

Will it make your brain explode if I tell you people can enjoy playing two different games at the same time.

More than just that, there was also a conversation between a female norn who reveres Jormag and a Sons of Svanir:

**Son of Svanir:** *To you? Preposterous!*

**Reveler (female norn):** *Laugh if you want, but know this: I hear everything he says.*  
---
&gt;**Reveler (female norn):** *You'd do well to listen.*  
---
**Reveler (female norn):** *You have no good reason to keep us out.*  
---
**Son of Svanir:** [*Fratricide*](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Svanir) *is something we frown on. Blame* [*Jora*](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jora)*.*  
---
**Reveler (female norn):** *Open your eyes! Before they're opened for you.*  
---
&gt;**Reveler (female norn):** *Dragon will rise, and on that day you will see what I'm capable of.*

**Reveler (female norn):** *And then you'll answer to me.*

Interesting, the account(s?) that posted those threads have been deleted
---
The monetisation is still up in the air. It could be free, it could be tied to POF, it could be pay to access. If it is POF + Hot I am fine personally, but I would rather it be just either expansion so more people can play it.
---
If it is pay to play for season 5 then whether I would pay depends on its content. If it is similar to previous seasons I wouldn't pay for it. If it comes with "expansion level content" then maybe, but it depends on what that is.
---
Sailing and crashing hahaha

Condi mirage is still insane or at least very good in every game mode except for wvw zergs.

Omg no more purple and on to blue!! I love blue

I'm with you on that one, it's partly why I don't want cantha. Because I already explored it, albeit a different game and ages between etc.
---
I want unexplored charr lands, janthir. Dazlana.
---
Something new. They did give me some of that with Balthazar instead of a dragon. But I can understand them also wanting to get the "dragon story" over with.
---
I've always wanted a snowy expansion ! Please let it be real !
---
If you zoom in on the snow storm, you can make out what looks like Jormag's face.
---
Me neither, I'd just uninstall in peace
---
I'm reaching a point where I wouldn't care about LS even if Anet paid me to play it
---
It’s still like a B- in the grand scheme of things. Even slower MMOs like FF14 have way more interesting PvE than GW2.
---
Well if content is good like new new things I’d pay 15-30$ for a whole season bc that’s pretty much what an xpac is. As Long as there new features new specs new race I’d pay I’m not broke 💁🏼
---
Interesting twist. I had it in my mind that the upcoming stuff would have a more tropical (read: Krytan/oceanic) vibe. I'm intrigued to say the least. Though I seriously hope we're not launching straight into Jormag.
---
If you're looking for more training and raids there are discord training groups like [Raid Academy](https://discord.gg/mpVnEju) to help out.
---
With the amount of content living stories provide , I am not sure how they have been free all along .  The problem now is paying for something that was once free .

Makes me wonder about Anya from dragon bash now. I wish i could have made a thread about this,but she also had a unique attack i never seen in the game with her gs, a downright bash
---
Yes but there's a huge difference between that and the ability to actually get somebody banned because they got pissy about something and had their guild mass report.
---
Meh
---
Speaking as someone who played the hell out of GW1 and never came back for GW2, I'm stunned that the community is still active! I hope whatever they show at this live event, you all have a great time.
---
Fair enough.

finally we can play as kodan
---
I’ll take number 4 with a side of xpac announcement
---
WoW is currently of a World First race that is lasting for about 2 weeks, thats why its viewership is at its peak.
---
Still of course would pass GW2 even without it, but usually it's far lower numbers.
---
With how close to the chest they play their story, any information we get on that will be more teaser than not. I cannot imagine we'd be getting any story information on an expansion after Season 5 because of that. Doesn't mean they couldn't tease an expansion outside of its story though, but I'd be surprised if they did.
---
I could see new elite specializations coming, especially due to some of the recent class changes. Paring down elite specializations along with some interesting core class changes may be hinting at this. I just struggle to see how exactly they'd release them in a LW season and not an expansion. Would there be a price tag? Given for free or maybe initially free and paid for later?
---
I just hope they can deliver on making this season something more than previous seasons. I'm worried they'll release something underwhelming, but they can technically point to as being along the lines of what they promised.
---
Rotation and experience will matter a lot more than ascended vs exotic (~13% DPS difference). So really if anyone can [get geared in exotics](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) (if you're power DPS an ascended weapon is most of the DPS difference too) and do fine. Knowing your rotation (and later learning the bosses will make a much bigger difference on any class. I would still try to get proper stats though since stat selectable gear is very easy to get now.
---
[Raid Academy](https://discord.gg/mpVnEju) is still active, most of the trainers that were spread out consolidated there.

No kidding lol. I don't actually expect any of that , except elite specs now attached to LW.

I did play it quite a bit and it was my main MMO between WoD release and HoT release, but I've not played the game recently. I found the healing to be mundane and incredibly dull. It wasn't comparable in the slightest to what was available in WoW at the time, or before hand and while I enjoy the resource management aspects that are entirely lacking from GW2, there is better (and more diverse) trinity healing available elsewhere. 
---
It might be better now, but that has little to do with your baseless supposition of how much I played. If you need to make comments such as that instead of simply accepting an equally valid but different perspective on the game, we aren't going to get far and I'm not keen on continuing the conversation.
---
well i do now
---
Well, it also has to do largely with streamers, most of those games that beat out GW2 have like one or two streamers, not really a dedicated community. I think it's simple, GW2 has no competitive game mode or content that is stream worthy, add that to that a lot of "bigger" streamers who have lost interest over time naturally. 
---
Personally, I don't think it's a big deal. The game still brings in enough revenue to not be shutdown. We just have to accept it'll never big a big stream friendly game.
---
&gt; GW2 raids don't get viewers unfortunately.
---
They actually do. When a new raid gets released GW2 streams can get 1-2k viewers. It's not much compared to WoW's wirld first races being in the 40-80k range, but it's still the highest GW2 ever gets.
---
Difference is, GW2 wirld first race lasts 2 hours and then the viewers leave. WoW wirld first race can last weeks.
---
MMOs are dying out. WOW subs way down , and nothing new good for a long time ( Bless failed, and FF 14 isn't new, it just took 4 or 5 years to make it playable).

---
what leak?
---
At first it looked like a coincidence. But the more I look at it, I can see the shape of a dragon head. Though maybe that's just what I want to see... IDK
---
He's saying if it's historically terrible and still terrible, nothing has changed
---
What else than dragons could it ever be xD
---
is there even any modern mmo out there which has really good &amp; supported pvp.  
---
i think you are better off with any moba or so.
---
FFXIV shot up above Fortnite during each of the fanfest streams too
---
Actually, LS5 is not just GW3, it is also GW4 and GW5 on a revolutionary post-peak game engine, with ten trillion hours of repeatable gameplay, 28 different mounts and build templates.
---
What is there even to get excited about?  Let's be real, we're not getting player housing, or a new race, or anything that could generate hype, the only thing that might become a reality is build templates, big whoop, 7 years late and at this point a nice qol gimmick but I doubt people are jumping with joy to play the same old content yet again but now with a fancy new menu thingy... And I doubt we're starting season 5 guns blazing and dragon heads rolling, yet again... It's most likely going to be another slow building and milked out evil dragon killing story yet again... (speculation ofc, I'd love to be wrong but the Anet story team isn't exactly famous for compelling and mind-blowing adventure tales of any kind)
---
It's literally the only thing we have and I'm damn well gonna be excited about it. If it flops, that's pretty much game over anyways. Might as well be hyped for a while.
---
Sounds like a new living story episode....... meh
---
Tldr
---
Music is an art form that I’m not very good at. However, I have spent my entire career working on movies, and in that case, I’d rather be making than watching. Regardless, it’s a poor argument. Guild Wars 2 (and most games) were designed to be played, not just watched. The only time I could ever imagine watching a streamer was if I couldn’t play the game, and even then, watching someone else play a game doesn’t sound interesting. I’d rather watch edited content, like Game Sack, Rerez, My Life in Gaming, or similar.
---
Cautiously optimistic about this, hoping we see some cool stuff.
---
and regardless of all that, gw2 would still be lower any other time
---
Yeah, that is fine, I meant people who try to predict the whole story and all gameplay changes already. Those are the ones who will get disappointed no matter what they actually show or release.
---
Lots of people are getting hyped, but looking at what we know is in the works:
---
Living story season 5
---
Build templates
---
WvW alliances
---
I'd be surprised if they pull something totally unexpected like an elite specs or some other game changing content. Besides they make a lot of money by tying elite specs to expacs. If anything they might announce a new mount or mastery line
---
I'm not overhyped. It's simple really. They said that it's for a living story and that they'll not go into another expansion pack immediately, but want to implement expansion pack like things in a living story.
---
So, we're just going to get an entirely new expansion-pack-like patch with 5 new zones, a lengthy story, new mastery features (akin to gliding and mounts), new elite specs, and it will all be free to download.
---
And yet /emote ranges are still 3x what /say ranges are. A bug people have complained about since launch.
---
They listen to what they want to hear.
---
If the jade sea is coming, they could add a seaturtle; all other mounts slip on the slippery sea, except the turtle, who has some combat skills. It's slow, but swims fast under water. I just miss the Luxon/kurzick pvp I guess :(. It was quite entertaining to me.
---
&gt; and build templates.
---
Whoa whoa whoa, keep your expectations in check!
---
I wouldn't expect much if anything at all. It wont be anything major, 45 minutes is way too little to announce anything significant.
---
It reminds me of the matriarch/patriarch head.
---
I've never had a group ask for my gear. LI and KP, yes, but not gear.
---
I only have \~110 LI, but still, that's been my experience since raids were first released. If your DPS is low, THEN they'll ask about your build and gear.
---
I highly suggest you test your damage out at the Practice Golems if you plan to play any DPS class, practice it until you can hit at least 80% - 90% of the Snow Crows benchmarks and then go for raids. Also, install arcdps. It'll make things easier and you'll be able see your own DPS during real boss fights.
---
please god no.
---
Just don't expect anything as big as mounts were for PoF. I wouldn't be too sure about elite specs too, at least not for the first few episodes. Guess we have to wait and see.
---
The most terrible classes and builds perform excellent in open world. Even then the raid top tier is completely different from open world because burstier soecs are favored. Core guard in open world is also a lol.
---
That is mostly on reddit though. I rarely ever see people complaining ingame compared to here. And if you liked the game world you can play most of it solo, don't get discouraged because some people on here don't like the game anymore.
---
Jokes on you, this is another character, I don’t got the damn money to be using a total makeover kit. And it’s okay if I get downvotes :(
---
One reason people watch a stream is because of the streamer. A streamer can be really good at the game, can be entertaining, funny, you can ask questions about a topic where the streamer is good at and you get "pro" tips. Someone new to raids can get an insight into boss fights he has never seen before and get some ideas on how to succeed at it. It's not only because of the game.
---
Yeah, my thoughts exactly. Even if I do not like the new content I will at least get some new skins to use.
---
It's kinda funny that they had an announcement for an announcement... a month in advance. We've got an entire month to wait just to learn what's planned, then however long after that for the actual release.
---
Well the main thing is I don't want to invest time into a game where the end game is no good and the updates roll out extremely slow
---
Hardly anything in that "leak" is correct. The only stuff that's remotely close to anything are general statements.
---
Stop spreading that bullshit.
---
PvP?
---
I didn’t bother to use a total makeover kit. It was just another character I had left over to toy around with. I had initially thought that it was a cool idea but I guess the feeling wasn’t mutual with anyone but myself.
---
Its gonna be interesting to see whats worthy of an event with actual people present ala hot announcement.
---
Esp since its lw and its gonna lack the meatiness of an expansion drop.
---
Do you think they will have 45 mins of of hype material to talk about?
---
Yeah, I understand that. In my opinion there are a lot of things to do in the game right now so I don't really mind if they take their time with new content releases. But on the other hand I am not really interested in raids so my opinion on end game is probably completely different to most other people.
---
What's it mean when they throw a Guild Banquet or a siege golem on your corpse though?
---
The funny thing is this character doesn’t even have an ounce of inspiration from Anime but I guess many felt otherwise (and I could see why). I just had thought that the color scheme wasn’t too bad just because Cantha could’ve evolved for all we know, but i guess not which is okay too.
---
Touché, sorry I couldn’t meet your expectations :( ! Will try and be better next time !
---
No u, Smiljane
---
I love how people are getting ridiculously hyped for stuff like an expansion when the release clearly says its about the next chapter in living world. It's just going to be a road map for the next LW season plus some new features.
---
I mean to be fair WoW is WoW and FFXIV just had a big update and a lot of people are checking it out. GW2 had a lot of twitch viewers when POF came out.
---
Yeah man, game is amazing!!!
---
Give it a try, fractals are the best dungeons in any mmo!
---
That’s cool alright, but that isn’t really a good way to validate her appearance just because it was drawn from inspiration. It’s fine though it’s whatever.
---
I think a mix of mountainous, snowy areas and deep "underdark" areas is an interesting concept to fill a season with, but I do hope they take their time in feeding back into the Elder Dragon plot. After all, Jormag and Primordus are still asleep, so that gives me hope.
---
People love to speculate about future content ... whats wrong with that?
---
no
---
That's actually a really nice looking tattoo :o
---
Not sure how I feel about a necromancer using a flame thrower.
---
One cautionary note on that, while the upgrades are account-wide, they can only be mined/harvested/opened once per account per day, so while you can access them on any character you have, you can still only obtain them once.
---
I think that's snow too. You could also look at it as rough water/waves at the bottom, and the snow being splashes of water/rain.
---
I was looking for someone to make this comment, wasn’t disappointed.
---
Yeah but with Warframe, you can turn off those effects or go to ludicrous levels of particles.
---
You failed to miss my point (which I might not have brought over properly) which is that you shouldnt tell pugs to fake kp for every kill group after they kill it a couple of times when they think they know mechanics, while there is so much more to fractals besides killing the boss without any downs
---
but a few k is quickly 10-20% :(
---
*You* were the one asking for explanations and kept asking "Why?" "What for?" like a lost child.
---
But of course an idiot like you would be exhausted of the thought alone to read more than 20 words at a time. Your processor started overheating after my first point obv. Sorry for that.
---
That’s cool, but I don’t really have enough time to do everything I want to in GW2 (or life in general), and have to be very selective in how I spend the time that I have.
---
Penguin aquatic mount maybe?
---
Yeah the new plantsim models look awesome
---
yeah haha, i mean like 8k lower easily, which is pretty much 20+%
---
Yeah I agree with everything you said. They did confirm they’ll have four LW teams though
---
So the announcement is time-gated?
---
I guess, killing it with fire isn't an option anymore?
---
Dang. The red to blue means we are going north.
---
To Vabbi!
---
noob question whats the reward for beating Dhuum cm on the first time
---
Gw2 mobile inc. can't wait!
---
Damon was expecting the Colin Train
---
If people were any sort of connected with the veteran/dedicated/hardcore playerbase, they'd know this isn't a sudden attack on the reddit lol. Utterly ridiculous to think that. This has been a long time coming.
---
It's been a couple years IRL now, and the devs have said in the past that they generally aim the releases in the games timeline to mirror the passage of time IRL unless explicitely said otherwise.  
---
It's also safe enough to assume both Jurmag and Primordus, whose magics are each other's unique weakness apparently, simply went dormant and started sucking on the nearest ley line to heal/recharge from the damage done similarly to Kralk in the new zone.
---
+ on that. People keep coming up with excuses like gw2 usually has 20k viewers. Fact is its about 200 to max 1k.
---
 entry fee is 1000 Mystic Coin.
---
I returned to the game in January this year after not playing for ~3 years and I have been playing pretty consistently since then with a one month break in between. Since then I got PoF and finished the entire storyline, got mounts, learned fractals, made my first legendary etc. and there is still a lot of content that I did not even touch yet. Maybe my long break is why I am not burned out on the existing content like a lot of other people are.
---
Nah
---
There has been a growing criticism of content release schedule since they confirmed S5 before an expac (obviously before that too, but that was not unusually much), but the last few weeks had seen an unnatural increase of actually toxic and low effort flaming - what the mods posted very well describes that and i dont think its unlikely that it actually happened
---
&gt;Would the shiverpeaks include dwarves?
---
The Dwarves were home to the southern Shiverpeaks, what's now the Steamspur Mountains. We've been to their capital (Thunderhead Keep) and their major trading city (Droknar's Forge). We've even been to their rival faction's headquarters (Sorrow's Furnace - renamed Sorrow's Embrace).
---
The Far Shiverpeaks did have some dwarves, but they were exiles or travelers. It was mostly the norn and jotun who lived there.
---
HYPEEEEEEEEEEEE, new expansion! tengu as a playable race! build templetes! wvw alliances finally coming!!!!!! what isn't there to be hyped about this update.
---
If "delete gw2, it's dead game"
---
is prohibited, can it also apply to:
---
Here is a picture of my first legendary I took with my sony ericson cybershot1337? Oh damn, I'm on the front page.
---
Here is a picture of my first legendary I took with my sony ericson cybershot1337?
---
There is not a single subreddit on the entire site that has gotten worse after banning memes entirely.
---
I showed the full zerk  ascended armor for dh, ascended gs and ascended scepter, off hand Torch was exotic. They told me since the Torch was exotic i had to go
---
I kinda see a dragon's snout beneath them. Might just be color choice though and a fine case of pareidolia.
---
Except Australia stole it.
---
I bet you also think pizza comes from new York
---
On that note, what qualifies as low effort seems to change depending on the mod's mood when they see it in new. I wouldn't qualify the 1000th post saying "wouldn't it be cool to get shortbow on mes!" or "after playing for 100h I finally got my first legendary" as particularity high effort.
---
However heated it's gotten, remember the core reasons for it: This is our final outcry to the community/anet, the last-ditched attempt to gain any sort of hope for this game's future for a non-casual player. That's all it is. We've been civil for years and just get ignored by anet and shat on by toxic casuals.
---
You forgot the 5 new classes and 3 elite specs for each class, 5 new mounts, 15 new raids and a 200 hour long storyline.
---
i was disappointed when they said s5 would come out immediately after 4. i dont think i could get more disappointed than i am now. unless they announce gw2 is going on maintenance mode or shutting down, i guess that would make me more disappointed
---
I'm reporting this sorry, it offends me that you don't think the game is perfect.
---
5 champ bags and some karma for participating.
---
Like the Hall of Monuments!
---
We don't. But the devices actually work by creating a copy of ourselves that are the ones actually playing at dilated time, then sync the memories of the copy and the originals while the original sleep.
---
Since they are perfect copies, they make all the exact same decisions the originals would make, and creates the illusion that we are actually controlling the copy. 
---
And even after we die or stop playing, our copies remain in the game.
---
FOREVER.
---
Anyone who is stupid enough to get “hyped” will be easy to satisfy.
---
head over to /r/warframe and you will see a whole new level and world of memeing arround with the game and the devs do it too.  
---
would be boring AF without all this going arround.
---
OMEGALUL
---
Back after the mass restructuring they said S5 wont necessarily have new maps, or at least not for every release. They may expand on current ones. Of course they said that at the start of S3 too and here we are.
---
Would still be good for me if the story goes something like: Aurene flies over to Cantha, meets Kuunavang (or offspring or Albax or offspring). Other dragon begs her to help in Cantha, Aurene gets back and we come over. Aurene and other dragon get eggs together. 
---
(wishful thinking)
---
This is censorship plain and simple. People who are genuinely not happy with the game they love are voicing their opinions. Writing them off as “trolls who use vote manipulation” is simple ignorant. The game is in a bad state for anybody who plays more than once a week and that’s clear to see.
---
We like people to voice their opinion. Lul

Degenerates like you belong on a cross, Boyscout. AVE!
---
It's still gonna be cantha, sorry guys. Norn are gonna be fat, drunkard, bros and depart even further from their original concept and we're going to go to cantha in the middle of winter. They ARE gonna introduce a new norn, but he's going to be a bro douche bag and his name is going to be Chad. Season 5 is only going to be one map, and it's cantha, but it's the side of bloodstone fen, unfortunately. The reason they are doing this is so that Arena net can say "see? we did cantha, it took us 3 months, but it's done and we don't have to do it again" Anyway, can't wait
---
But for hard core casuals like me, the living world has to have some challenge too. Admittedly that fight was a clusterfuck and I didn't think it was fun, but the challenge portion of world boss in a game where that's the major update type has to be something more than just the equivalent of tank and spank. The problem is some casuals want some challenge, but not T4 Fractals levels of challenge and there's little enough of it in the game.
---
The other problem is everyone has different levels of what's difficult. The Living World bosses that are harder are a bit better for me. At least I end up remembering them. lol
---
It's my MMO and I'll HYPE if I want to. :P
---
Another wall of text full of shit that has been said 100 times before.
---
By the pale tree....
---
They're not going to get rid of it, but I agree with you, it's crap. It's a terrible mechanic. The worst part is is the dev who designed it bragged about it as a feature before Heart of Thorns was released.
---
&gt; Episode 6 did not have enough content to last +3 months
---
There has never been an episode that gave you that much.

I already completed Wing 1 (all achievements), Wing 2 (almost all achievements, half Wing 3, almost all Wing 4. I'm not really a newbie.

---
&gt;wow that video is good, it should be upvoted then its manipulation
---
I believe admins have generally have treated this as manipulation. Got someone banned from the site when they did it in... r/lol or r/overwatch iirc?
---
Check out the [rules](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or):
---
&gt;Vote manipulation is against the Reddit rules, whether it is manual, programmatic, or otherwise. Some common forms of vote cheating are:
---
&gt;*     Using multiple accounts, voting services, or any other software to increase or decrease vote scores.
---
*    **Asking people to vote up or down certain posts, either on Reddit itself or through social networks, messaging, etc. for personal gain.**
---
* Forming or joining a group that votes together, either on a specific post, a user's posts, posts from a domain, etc.
---
"This should be upvoted" usually counts.
---
yes, why wouldn't u?
---
Thanks so much for all the info; I'm intrigued. I play ffxiv (never really played wow), so would you say the challenging stuff is equivalent to like savage difficulty? That's my main enjoyment of the game (although I thought maybe gw2 would be to relax for a bit from ffxiv).
---
Also, is there a dps meter I can download 3rd party or that's included in the game? I'd be really interested in looking for optimizing rotations and such.
---
&gt; **for personal gain**  
---
nothing personal go gain, not against the rules. it was not his video.
---
The achievement and [chest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dhuum%27s_Top-Tier_Supplies) (like you get from most CMs). Completing all achievements in Hall of Chains gets you the "Voice in the Void" title too
---
And it's like communicating with a brick wall. ArenaNet probably doesn't have the resources to change anything. But hey, it's mostly venting for me.
---
Ninja edited, this morning there were calls to upvote certain posts posted by the people on stream. Karma counts as personal gain.
---
It's like.. Anet didn't already say they're doing S5 months ago. Reddit is so dumb sometimes. Bitching for a week cause no news about something we know won't be coming for at the very least 2 more months.
---
Then anet comes with a "season 5 is really a thing" and you lose your minds.
---
That DH may have had bad gear as well and may have been kicked after you. Regardless, beating one (bad) DPS isn't exactly a clear picture of your DPS. Maybe get some more pulls and post logs in this thread or seek help in the training discords?
---
I've dialed down my play but I usually just said "I have this wing's title" and that was enough for KP. I don't think I've ever had to ping gear.
---
Isn't that what every youtuber does?

Gee a company times it's announcement to coinicide with a major convention to get more publicity, which they don't do often enough and people complain about and you're complaining that they're dong that. 
---
In the forums I've been arguing that they would make an announcement that doesn't go head to head with the FF XIV announcement, because you know, they're a business and need to do things strategically if they're going to move forward and anyone with half a brain can see they're trying to move forward. Saying it's not good enough to make a special announcement to get more eyes on the game is bad how exactly?
---
Wouldn't that be the equivalent of using blood?
---
It's almost like it's an important topic for a lot of people.
