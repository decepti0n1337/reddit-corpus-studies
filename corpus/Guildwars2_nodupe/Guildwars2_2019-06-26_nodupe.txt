That one furry guild? There are like 5 or 6 to my knowledge (and I'm the GM of one of them)
---
---
---
Don't you have to use them _in_ Hoelbrak though?
---
Oh trust me, I will! I plan to! The issue is for people who don't wanna do that. A lot of people don't wanna interact with the cash shop.
---
*cough* improvements *cough*, Only an idiot would buy from this vendor. 1 jorabreaker is neary 28g meanwhile the actual value of the legendary shard chest is ~ 6.99g
---
Don't worry it's all part of the grand plan.
---

---
That is, get players to spend $1k.
---
it's mostly used in 99cm and 100cm since arkk is technically one of scarlet's alliance
---
Ah. I was thinking it would just let you have the game play one of your other characters for you, but this makes more sense.
---
Are they worth it?
---
I really wish I could have been there! ;; Take care you beautiful people
---
Really? I’ll write that down for my next 100CM run, thanks!
---
Turns out pinatas have the same problem....switched to different character and stopped getting them
---
r/unexpecteddune
---
These are not from chests? Chests have ugly embellished weapons. Bioluminescent in OP are from Black Lion Weapon Specialist.
---
It's not necessary, but can give you some more flexibility with team builds, and if you play multiple characters it can give you hero access earlier than normal.  One of the most popular hero comps right now is stacking a lot of Mesmers, but to do that you need to get Norgu (halfway through Nightfall) and Razah (beat Nightfall) to go with the easily attainable Gwen, so it takes some time to get there on a new character.  You can use a Mercenary Hero slot to port your Mesmer character over to other characters and get that train running earlier, and then eventually even stronger once you're able to stack all four Mesmers together to melt things with Energy Surges.
---
But it isn't necessary by any stretch.  The default heroes are more than enough to manage.
---
Sounds like someone should look for their missing sister more often.
---
ANET, shame, same 6 yr old junk still dropping.
---
Well, they're definitely not going to be putting out a full-mount-pack of all the "core" mounts, plus the dung bettle, plus the helicopter each time... they make more money selling "catch up" packs that're for one mount at a time.
---
I just saw a post about mails you get from new content while in mistlock and it had over 300 upvotes and people seemed to genuinely not know you could do that
---
Playing GW2 for immersion lol
---
Yes, it's new. I've visited the area a few weeks ago while leveling a character, and it didn't have any Icebrood there, especially not with such a distinctive voice with specific sound effects (sounds like Sam Riegel to me, but the effects make it somewhat difficult to pinpoint whether the VA is actually him).
---
Fixed now!
---
People who bought the mount packs before they added new mounts should get the other 3 mount skins for free, imo.  Or at least discounted.
---
Scourge in Fractals tends to either be Vipers or some form of healer with a Marshal/shaman mix. So just keep that in mind. With that said, Reapers are pretty solid and they use berserker gear in fractals.
---
Yeah but this amused me haha
---
According to the wiki, a friendly Icebrood Claymore has been around though.
---
I REALLY hope you're right though, been waiting 7 years for real norn content.
---
I adore the WvW lounge pass (Armistice Bastion) but it ultimately has the same problem as mistlock for clicking invitations and stuff like that.  On the flip side, it is a really cool area and has an arena, and while things are more spread out, the special action lets you teleport automatically to all the vendor/crafting/forge areas.
---
do not follow the com and you are fine
---
Yea I made that comment about ten minutes before someone in game pointed out you can just buy and sell the boxes on the TP, for some reason I assumed they were bound.
---
I mean, that this leveling system is so different that I am a little bit lost haha, but you are right is really fun!
---
It's fun for 3-4 minutes.  Then wait 15 minutes for the next one.  This is from someone with all the mounts.
---
Needs a boss at the end for sure.  Maybe not every single stampede but yeah.
---
That's not what they are talking about. When clicking on the mail, it shows you the map and circles the area, but because you are on the wrong layer, it circles nothing.
---
The problem that post is about is clicking on waypoint links. It doesn't leave the mistlock layer and even if you click then change layers, it keeps the view point in the middle of the ocean. For things like mails, you have to leave mistlock, then click the mail to see where it's actually talking about.
---
Yea i know, and in the comments a bunch of people started debating on how other passes are better because you can wp out of them
---
[https://snowcrows.com/potions/fractals/](https://snowcrows.com/potions/fractals/)
---
To be fair condi soulbeast (or condi anything for that matter) *is* a bad build for this kind of event. At least when it is that overrun.
---
Did it 3 times, one on chrono where I literally just put down wells, 2 on power sb. Always gold. I can see how you're fucked if you have no mount though.
---
I edited that Icebrood Claymore into the wiki's area page not that long ago if that's what you mean.
---
What's also interesting is that this Icebrood utilizes the "trigger voiced dialogue upon approach" stuff which the devs have been using for NPCs in PoF and Season 4 whereas vanilla NPCs just have lengthy dialogues at specific intervals without any input from the player (most of the time). :)
---
Then post it in that thread so those people know?
---
But is there a  version that shows of the holographic Shatterer from 2013?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I personally like Holo Shatterer more than Holo Kralkatorrik.
---
I think he was meant to replace the commander e.g. us in the living world season 4 trailers.
---
If you never claimed to play alone, then why are you commenting on a post that is about playing alone. Also my comments were for the guy who replied to you. I never planned on talking to you. For this exact reason. You're too inept to realize that all of the arguments that YOU are making, can be turned around and used against you. I'm done losing brain cells. Enjoy being a hypocrite.
---
What I have noticed is hearts are decent enough sometimes, but I catch most of my levels are from finding waypoints, pois, vistas, and hero points. I find myself running ALL over the place. Haha.
---
The main reason why I decided to stick with my Airship Pass instead, now I just use the mistlock when I need dungeon/fractal vendors
---
Technically this is what elite specs are.
---
Because lootbox was a term that existed long before EA decided to taint it.
---
Pinatas are capped. No idea about the rest.
---
Unpopular opinion here, but I think it's fine.  
---
I think even looking at the map and going to other waypoints should not be allowed in the mistlock.  
---
Mistlock should be a lounge for those who want to do fractals and whatever.   You already have teleport to major cities there and you can port back to where you were in the world.  
---
Using waypoints from tyria should be the advantage of the other lounges.
---
That. Isn't. The. Point.
---
Thank you for the consideration to this thread meant to highlight an issue many players are having with what is (I assume) meant to be a rewarding, fun experience for all
---
Oh if you're the one that entered that... then I am quite excited!
---
Seriously? Why does the achievement say so? lol
---
Probably referring to the chests?
---
Exactly what I was looking for ty!
---
WEEKLY lock out !!!
---
You just can't leave well enough alone can you !
---
Just when I praise you for the thoughtful addition, you go and fuck it up !!!
---
AGAIN !!!
---
I think the time has finally come for me to move on from this game !
---
I do not agree with most o the decisions made lately, about the direction of the game, and how things are being implemented. The game has moved from a having fun state to a let's grind state.
---
Not what I sign up for, and not what I'm here to support.
---
Thank you for the glorious 6 years, I will keep my good memories of you.
---
Good bye, guild wars universe, it was fun while it  lasted.
---
But these aren't gemstore
---
Matthias best boss! Good job, nice to see people still attempt good lowmans.
---
Amen bruddah!
---
Amen Bruddah!
---
Revenant is great, and super flexible.  As others have noted, Alacrity Renegade (needs the Path of Fire expansion) is meta for fractals, and a really solid pick in Raids, providing crucial support (mainly the Alacrity boon, but also might, and a few unique buffs) as well as doing solid DPS.  You could also sacrifice some DPS to do decent healing as well.
---
In addition to these more supportive builds, you can just go full damage, either condition damage with Renegade, or power damage with Herald.  Special shout-out to Power Herald, which is one of my favorite builds for just brain-dead farming the open world; really high sustain, and the easiest damage rotation in the game (literally just auto-attacks) while still maintaining acceptable dps.
---
As for how to level, just do literally anything.  Everything gives XP: discovering new locations, completing hearts, doing events, killing enemies, crafting, harvesting, completing dailies, and doing dungeons.  If you prefer instanced content, doing the story dungeons as they come up is good xp, though LFGs can take some time to fill, otherwise just roam maps doing events until you're high enough level to move to the next map.  You'll be 80 before you know it.
---
Zhteintan?
---
[removed]
---
This is a great example /u/Gertrude_D and thank you. It is flawed where mounts give a considerable advantage and those using mechanics do not gain.
---
It's the best way to farm holo kills, tho.
---
Other players destroy the holograms in open world before you can tag anything but the veteran.
---
&gt; That players ask for new stuff and then instantly turn around and whine about it?
---
Find me ***ONE MUTHERFUCKER*** **that asked for this bullshit undefined Core Swap bullshit! ***ONE.***
---
Fact - you can't. Fuck off.
---
I don't think the collection felt too difficult at all. Only if you want it done over the weekend.   
---
I think they will only change things if somehow they kill the population on the LWS4 maps (because you need more players to farm events). I would love to see them design inwards a bit more though - like new events appearing on old maps so that players get special chances to earn extra currency/boxes! If Skyscale gets easier in the future, it will probably be because there's more events/tracks/etc
---
Oh its busy. We have dragon bash happening now, a possibly WvW weeklong bonus event coming up soon, living world season 5 is coming up at some point, we have build templates coming at some point as well.
---
It's 250 for all elite specs now.
---
G-sync ?
---
Enjoy your dying gamemode :)
---
It'd be hilarious if they spined like a slot machine once you left combat, and randomly landed on a different skill from each player you defeated since you entered combat.
---
Horrible nearly unplayable chaos, but hilarious.
---
&gt; They’re fewer now as the community has stopped trying to reason with a brick wall.
---
Because more and more the community is quitting the game. I stopped playing but for weekends, and I stopped even worrying about getting the 'loyalty bonus' weeks ago.
---
This legitimately made me cry. Great work!
---
Aww! Thank you so much!
---
Lol forgot it's wvw
---
I remember Tail Swishers and that's about it
---
You will have buy the game or gems to get the shoulders and boots if they ever come back to the gemstore.
---
The rest are easily obtainable. 
---
Just type /wiki in that, then Shift+Click the pieces you like in the wardrobe.
---
You will go to the wiki page of those skins, and they will show you the items that give those skins.
---
Type /wiki /wiki in chat for more info about using the /wiki command.
---
Fk off, no one asked for your input
---
What was the point of your post? I just don't understand.
---
Is it that easy??... but I guess I still need to get to 80 first right? And do some hard dungeons I guess?
---
Although what you say is true, I doubt most people playing through these games care about economy or PvP. It's so old that most are probably just clearing the PvE content by themselves+heroes or reminiscing, rather than competing.
---
It may take less time, but it's still time during which you are not doing anything else.
---
Instead, use the time to go around the city using fireworks and pinatas while waiting for the race and moa events.
---
It'll take a bit longer, but all the time spent with the skills recharging is time spent doing something else, so no time is wasted.
---
*puts down newspaper*
---
I should get a roller beetle.
---
As with any lottery, the odds that SOMEONE will get them is very high... the odds that you personally will are extremely low.
---
The achievement refers to the firework cannons in hoelbrak that also work.
---
You can combine the consumable fireworks and the cannons, running between them while the skills recharge, nearly cutting the time by half and maybe a bit more than by using alacrity, provided you are able to spend less than 5s between cannons.
---
Very much appreciate this comment. Im only level 37 on my rev but I am loving it and cant wait to see it into the end game! Thank you for all the info.
---
RNGesus wasn’t on My side I just lose 1500g from  last week
---
So I better hurry up to get the wings?
---
In fractals, firebrand is extremely powerful just like renegade as well, imo. Specifically, a good fb can aegis mechanics that allow the dps to just keep burning, along with great condi cleanse, access to resistance and stability if needed, bane signet share, and warrior level dps. Then, alacrigade can boost dps even more with soulcleave summit and assassins presence. You can’t get most of these things no matter how hard you try with druid chrono. The only edge you get with druid is now spirits, which a soulbeast dps can take, and spotter, which builds now are optimized without. I personally love the new support comp since you can just do so much more than druid chrono.
---
Mm...instead of an entire skills selected, ones not used by your enemy would fill your used slots. Would be nice
---
If you want a rewards simulator where you can't fail any events, where the serialized storyline boils down a minecart cutscene you just watch, then by all means, it's in a good state.
---
If you want challenging content where you always have the risk of failure, and the thrill of success, where you need to earn your victories, then GW2 is in a horrible state.
---
Depends your perspective and what kind of game you want to play.
---
Ty!, there are shoulders like the gloves in the picture, are they hard to get?
---
how
---
If you’re doing raids, druid is what you’re looking for. It’s used in every boss (unless you’re optimizing), usually 2. The “rotation” is easy. Mash every available button, press f5, 3 ,4 , 2, f5, and mash again. It’s great for learning raids as the simple rotation lets you learn the mechanics very well until you’re ready to do some other classes, which will be easy to gear once you get the insane amounts of ascended gear drops and gold. Once you play a build enough, it’s muscle memory; it’s only the first hour at the golem practicing that’s hard.
---
If you’re going to do fractals, daredevil or warrior is great. Their rotations are reeeealy simple. Remember you only need power for fractals.
---
You definitely don’t need to multiclass like a crazy man to do raids and fractals. It just makes it easier to join since you can fill more roles. Also, if you only have either power or condi, you can always just join for the bosses that favor it. Power will get you through all but 7. Dunno what’s up with the new raid wing, so that’ll change the number. Furthermore, remember that as a dps, you’re job is to make that number in arcdps as high as you can. Using either power and condi will make it easier to get higher numbers. Not choosing the right one is putting yourself at an unnecessary disadvantage, when parties want every edge so they can get it done quick. Gearing builds are decently cheap, with full exotics and ascended trinkets, and I’ve given the list of simple rotations for you. If you want to dps, use power daredevil (without completely draining endurance to be safe) and condi shortbow/shortbow soulbeast. However, I understand if you don’t want to have even 2 builds. If so, just do fractals! You can do them daily unlike raids, get one of the best gold per hour, have fights matching the difficulty of some raids, with just one power dps class of your choice.
---
2 hours of finding the best possible path and retrying because skill 2 is total shit.
---
literal god
---
Oh I gotchu. Alacrigade is replaced by chrono often (less firebrand in my experience).
---
I’m saying subbing in a chrono is still worse than using both firebrigade, and having either firebrigade will probably be better accepted, especially pug groups that are really strict about getting the right comp.
---
That's a great technique for the buildings! You can functionally blink around that way.
---
Except this isn't actual challenging/trial content. It's a festival activity that gives crap rewards. We were told it would have increased rewards and we don't. Raid CMs are "repeatable" but very few statics  actually do them because they don't get shit. Challenge is not enough of a reward to drive people
---
Those come from achievements...not from vendors
---
Mayhem
---
Last week  Lose 1500g
---
Don’t chase points but stay away from the pact and rush to a point nearby at the start of each event. I did my 10 today and got gold in 9 and silver in my first by just camping near a couple points and rushing one as soon as it started.
---
Hahaha awww someone really IS triggered!
---
Oh and wrong but whatever go on I wanna see you drool all over yourself screaming at the screen
---
Decided to not make a new thread for this. Do you have to be max level to do the Bash the Dragon dungeon? or whatever that 5 player portal is? Im level 2 on my new character. Lol.
---
I'm saying in ESO it did matter. Before they nerfed it it was something like 1-3 percent buff. That's quite a lot even to a casual.
---
I'll admit, I'm very surprised that the Stampede only has normal and veteran ranked mobs, regardless of how many people are present when they're spawned.
---
This kind of feels like a pre-Queen's Jubilee 2013 mistake Anet made. Which is weird since the projectors have different spawns (last time there were no veterans and always the same "type" of dragon minion (e.g., icebrood, destroyer, etc.) but now it's mixed types with veterans.
---
This sounds kind of like what Faren was supposed to be. Always sharing the glory in the commander’s achievements.
---
If buying from steam, it doesn't
---
Dunk the Lunk, thick as a castle wall.
---
I feel that. I play very sporadically nowadays. It’s 50/50 either it’s great or it’s like watching paint dry.
---
Generally I don't find this event very motivating, I find it a bit underwhelming.  What is it that I'm supposed to try for, in terms of rewards?
---
How do you get that.
---
Faker? I think YOU'RE the fake Commander here. You're comparing YOURSELF to ME!? HAH! You're not good enough to be my fake!
---
^Shootme..
---
buy dragon coffer 
---
open them 
---
profit ?
---
There’s three that come to my mind:
---
The ones shown (black feather)
---
The bat wings (bat wings and glider combo)
---
The dragon flapping wings (dragon wings and glider combo)
---
The last two usually show up around Halloween.
---
did the perma mistlock sanctuary pass return to the store? Been waiting for it for a while.
---
there is no point in doing it past 10
---
Commander, a word
---
I only have 26, and I’m really curious as to what route you took!!
---
i have proper AR for the fractals i do, and i have full exotic gear, ascended trinkets
---
And here i'm proud of myself getting 19 by the skin of my teeth
---
do the math, you fucking idiot
---
Thank you
---
 This guide showcases the 2 Dragon Bash stampede achievements: "Hologram  Herder" and "Stampede Survivor".   
---
You need to complete round 3 of the hologram stampede event 3 times in  order to complete "Stampede Survivor". It's an infinite achievement and  every 3 times you complete it you're awarded 3 Dragon coffers.  
---
For the "Hologram Herder" achievement you have to complete the event 11  times and are awarded 11 achievement points in total.
---
Yea, gold medal run can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv9w6Q8Jqm4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv9w6Q8Jqm4)
---
Backtrack a bit, you may have missed a trigger spot.
---
My necro needs all of them! I love it!
---
They both just said "1 hour ago" when I posted.  Reddit timestamps leave a lot to be desired.
---
I'm curious as to what the player base is like in gw1
---
I tried and it didnt work. I think it maybe one of those things where tou have to restart that mission. Thats what I ended up doing.
---
That's my point. The price of that backpack was beyond ridiculous in 2013, and it still is now, except now there is a shitton more uses for zhaitaffy: 5000 for drooburt, 5000 to eat for an achievement, 15000 to buy 3000 of food 5/each for an achievement...
---
([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scaled\_Dragon\_Wings\_Backpack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scaled_Dragon_Wings_Backpack))\[might be what you're looking for\]
---
I mean I’ve always considered them loot boxes but never really call them that I just say wintersday bags or something like that I guess. Idk why people aren’t referring to all of them as the same but in general they all are “loot boxes”. I’m with you man idk why people would refer to them differently
---
Yeah, in my experience the pressure really is on the new player to perform well. I frequently see new players joining saying “well I don’t have li but I know my rotation and the mechanics” and one of two things happens. They either do their role better than the experienced raiders because most “exp pugs” suck and no one bats an eye, or they die early on and get instantly kicked. At least people are willing to give them a shot, but it could be better.
---
Ah yeah, I tested it, you get upscaled to 80. no temp armor or anything. and only 2 abilities right now since so low level.
---
It's not out yet, is it? I don't see it on the store.
---
I'm talking about pulsing AoEs that you want enemies to stand in for their entire duration. The only significant one I can think of is Prime Light Beam over 50% Heat. These pulsing AoEs are hurt by knockbacks because you can push enemies out of them, thus lowering how much damage they do.
---
The AoEs you mentioned don't really require enemies to stand in a particular area; you can take those AoEs to the mobs after they move or get knocked back. You can't pick up and move Prime Light Beam's pulsing field once it's down, though.
---
Might be what you're looking for [`https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scaled_Dragon_Wings_Backpack`](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scaled_Dragon_Wings_Backpack)
---
Yeah the wiki says that it “might cost significantly more to buy with zhaitaffy than gold from the tp” but I wasn’t expecting a 1950g margin lmao
---
It's not just raids that drop those bags.
---
Sure thing! Always happy to provide sources when I have them.
---
[Its under the new team structure heading](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/)
---
Oh I can afford it. Just saying 20ish silver is really lowballing.
---
They're new as someone else said.
---
Dragon Bash was split into 2 as most releases back then were.
---
The first 2 weeks was literally what Lunar New Year is now: Scattered interactables, and the Dragon Ball Arena. Dragon Bash got repurposed into Lunar New Year.
---
The second 2 weeks was the same as the first with the addition of Aetherblade Retreat, which is now the Aetherblade Fractal and the Captain Mai Trin boss fractal.
---
I'm addition, there was a very short story instance introducing the Aetherblades.
---
I have had the same issue except that support has never contacted me back. I’m still waiting and I’ve sent them about 6 emails in the past year... I just gave up
---
My group finished scale 35 and it did end after that.
---
Got to 31 and figured then our team decided to disband because it’s too much work for the same reward
---
which one's the good skin
---
understand many of the wings come in a bundle of two: one is a cosmetic back piece. the other is a cosmetic for your glider which you get from the heart of thorns expansion
---
Omg it looks like it's worth it. Thank you very much!
---
what no sound?
---
Aah, i refer to them as fields. Yes, im a bit lacking on fields unless you count ones that dont really do damage. Prime light beam, i could waste dps using a bomb to make a smoke field, and then hard light arena has a light field and i dont know what any of the combo finishers do in that lol. Elixir gun can make an ethereal field, also kinda useless...in the holosmith's case, Muhammad definitely goes to the mountain lol.
---
Thank you for this in depth discussion of the finer points. I always feel great benefit from this type of talk and i appreciate you taking the time for the back and forth.
---
Having easy and hard mode is like the most obvious idea ever. Anet seems to dig in their heels to certain design rules for years and years after they are obviously bad.
---
Raids are well designed, voiced, etc, and a tiny fraction of the player base plays them. They need to be made more accessible.
---
They ALSO need to be the most hardcore and challenging content in the game.
---
This sounds hard, but literally every other MMO on the market does it by offering 2 or more difficulty levels.
---
Just make the really shiny stuff have like a 0.0001% chance of dropping on anything but the hardest.
---
This is the kind of event I've been hoping for, kind of like an endless dungeon/challenge, that with every successful level/phase the difficulty gets harder, requiring a good team comp at higher levels and better loot drops (Diablo 3's torment levels come to mind). It's a shame that it doesn't scale loot.
---
50 Kralk ore at the price of 1 Jorbreaker is exorbitantly silly.  Jorbreakers are currently 17 gold at buy bid and 24 gold at selling price.  
---
You can just fix the telescopes on two characters in under 10 minutes and get that 50 ore from the heart vendor for 5400 karma.  
---
Considering Kralk ore vendors and drops are 5x the rate of other map currencies, 1 Jorbreaker should get you 250 Kralk ore.  Even then I'd be leery of spending 20g on it.
---
If you're dropping the healing and concentration you're better off going condi druid which only needs ~50% duration with seraph weapons and trinkets and you'll get higher damage. What I was suggesting is the better build that still has healing and easy might stacking. A new raider will be learning the fights and have a lot to pay attention to anyways.
---
Well I am mostly used to high ping too, but mechanics that arent telegraphed too much in advance can be a struggle, like air updrafts which I still get downed half the time in the air.
---
CS is trash. But that’s partly his fault too. Dead game anyways. Move on in life.
---
Now it only needs to work with GW2 Hook (to remove bloom from post process) and everything is perfect
---
The fact that bashing a pinata refreshes skills is a gateway to greatness my friend.
---
Haven't checked yet.
---
There should be a speaker symbol in the bottom right of the gif.  Click it to unmute.

What fight do you mean exactly?
---
Balance changes in the middle of a competitive season IS retarded and it kills the game mode. Its like if in the middle of the world cup all of the refs said, listen guys, we changed our mind about this game, we're actually gonna rebalance the game to be more like tennis instead, nobody would take the world cup seriously anymore.
---
Q: When do you do big balance changes???
---
A: Not in the middle of a competitive season. Do it directly after the close of a competitive season so you have to WHOLE off-season to monitor those changes and react to bugs and meta abuses.
---
So yeah, of course nobody cares about ranked, nobody cares about gw2 pvp anymore. Its a joke.
---
nop, theres not even a play button. it just animates like a gif lol
---
Fractals have shifted from druid chrono to alacrity renegade and quickness firebrand. Druid chrono have way less dps, struggle with aegis, resistance and stability access, and have less offensive buffs. I’d say 70-80% of pugs have shifted to firebrigade, but druid chrono is usable. It isn’t the best anymore though.
---
Druid chrono in raids, however, is doing great. The firebrigade comps is also used in power raid bosses as well.
---
The rotation for support chrono isn’t hard once you get it down. The difficulty is getting people to stay within wells and doing pulls, distortions, and some variations depending on the situation.
---
You want a power class for fractals, so don’t use condi mirage. If you want to stick with Mesmer, you can go [power chrono](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/).
---
Check[snowcrows.com](snowcrows.com)  or [discretize.eu](discretize.eu) for all the builds!
---
tl;dr - chrono isn’t great for fractals anymore, but is in raids. Just takes a bit of practice (tanking might be a lil hard) to learn the rotation. Stick with power dps or firebrigade for fractals (not druid or chrono).

Well their canned responses over engine performance gains or as they've said, lack of gains, doesn't cover any cases of someone going out and proving otherwise. I'm sure they will eventually but no matter how they do it they're going to appear inept or as if they were just feeding the community bullshit all along.   
---
It took us what, 4 years to get smaa? Still no disconnection between bloom in the post processing settings, no click through ui, the list is long and most of whats on there is pretty seriously embarrassing for an mmo in 2019. Anets ability in these areas have consistently fallen behind basic where engine age is of little to no excuse, management is perfectly comfortable not giving two shits less as long as peeps keep buying gems. 400 staff and they couldn't pay one rando asshat sub full time hours til improve gaming experience. Can't exactly expect much from the developers so out of touch with their game that they believe peeps join wvw for the pve.
---
that'd be really cool. we can only hope!
---
If you have just that money to spend, I would definitely go for getting expansion. (or wait for sale on it and get both then) 
---
As an owner of expansion you have access to gold&lt;-&gt;gems exchange, so it is possible to just get gold through playing and buy gemstore items with it (might be little grindy that way, but hey, it is possibility).
---
And sometimes it took years for the community and Arenanet to see something.
---
Assassins went from disdained and largely written off as useless to "Oh shit, these guys can actually solo literally anything" without anything actually changing. People just didn't see how good some of the Elite skills were.
---
Before Factions I had an unkillable E/Mo build. It took 4 or 5 balance patches to actually break it. There were so many skills I could just swap out to replace ones given long cast times that all they managed to do was make it slower (Or near the end, killable if someone did nothing but strip enchantments on you the entire match.) *BEFORE FACTIONS.*
---
I will always love GW1 and I still do a full campaign playthrough every couple of years. But man that game had balance issues.
---
Really? As a NA player I didn’t know that!
---
However, firebrigade has a huge advantage over druid chrono, so it’s probably used by cm runs at least. That’s why I usually recommend not to play chrono, as firebrigade is objectively better, though that doesn’t mean chrono is unplayable.
---
Firebrigade has access to more dps, resistance and stability, aegis, reflects, condi cleanse, bane signet share, soupcleave summit and even spirits from a soulbeast. No matter how good at druid chrono you are, there are things you struggle with, most notably stability and support dps.
---
For t4’s honestly any 4 dps and a Druid works just fine. Once you know what you’re doing t4’s become breeze. CM’s and speedclearing t4’s, however benefit greatly from firebrigade’s advantages.
---
Imo, playing chrono is setting yourself up for a disadvantage (how big the disadvantage is is arguable). For new or returning players, I always recommend firebrigade for fractals so they do not limit themselves later.
---
If all else fails, try relocating the game somewhere less critical (out of Program Files folders). Windows is wonky and unpredictable.
---
&gt;I could have gotten to that zone with a teleport for example.
---
you couldn't. if you don't own a LS chapter it just eats your TP and boots you back out.
---
the ascended trinkets are bought with map currency, like the bloodstone back/amulet/rings from the fen, or ring/back/accessory from winterberries etc
---
They're talking about the tokens, not chests.
---
Right Hand Strength will be missed indeed. But imo these changes seem to be more geared toward a more homogeneous state that is is easier to balance for level 80 content rather than caring if you can crit cap with a DH in AC with only retal and fury :p (and that won't change drastically how much of a faceroll dungeons are with a group of level 80 bursty power dps).
---
With the spectating feature you can go inside logans lover. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Well i wouldnt want them to unlock my account without email confirmation...
---
Jesus, took me half an hour to get twenty
---
You can infuse and attune rings in the mystic forge so each ascended ring will have 3 infusion slots.  The wiki has the info for this.  Also note that if you have two identical unique rings, but one has three infusions and the other only has two, you *can* equip both of those.
---
Whats the relevance of your reply to the comment you replied to? Sorry, I'm confused haha.
---
But he has supplied his full name, credit card used, his game key, is address, game character names. Your telling me that wouldn't be enough for you?
---
No, you'd need to have Eye of the North too.
---
it's been immersion breaking ever since SAB gliders... at least this is a "real" thing... sort of...
---
Well don't be too lazy, T2s are really easy compared to some T4s (Mai Trin, Shadowmoon, Deepstone or Siren's Reef) or even 99 &amp; 100 CM.
---
There are very few mechanics per encounter considering its only T2 and most Boss abilitys are only active in T4, or deal way more damage / oneshot you in T4.
---
For starters I'd suggest taking in some form of Stability and swapping out your least damaging Utility skill...
---
Otherwise just gitgud
---
Yeah, build please.
---
I found some more dialogue regarding the dragons, but missed these :D
---
Should have a video up later today!
---
I accept every heal profession if you can play it good and heal us. Doesn't matter if it is druid, scourge, firebrand, revenant, scrapper, tempest. I don't have a stick in my ass like some people in this game.

I want to finish crafting my first ascended weapon, Yassith‘s reaver. I‘m struggling with two components:
---
1. The "Viper‘s Orichalcum Imbued Inscription" which can only be obtained by chests from raids, iirc. I have no ascended gear, can I even look into raiding yet? My guild offered to help so there’s that. 
---
2. Ley Line Sparks, how do I obtain them? Wiki doesn’t give much information.
---
She is choking herself for a more dramatic effect to fit in with the fashion wars.
---
One interesting thing I saw earlier was that the Fang of the Serpent had an arrow in it. That’s from when Braham shot it in LWS3. But when I came back after work, it was already gone...
---
It loads slower than any other map excluding LA, and there are too many infusion eye cancer people standing around, but other than that I don't regret the purchase.
---
Shame
---
It's almost like they don't want people playing these events for too long. It's so weird that for a game has so much grind for gold and shiny things, something like this which could be a fun way to grind for gold/shiny things is actively discouraged.
---
Made me chuckle but that’s a male hahah
---
Love the sound! Has anyone else noticed that the area the warhorn is gripped is a bit lower than it should be? At least on human and sylvari males (the only two I tried) it seemed off. The hand clips with the orb.
---
Let's go deeper...
---
[Moar Speculatoin] The Inquest Overseer is Taimi. She also fits 1,2, and 3.
---
I don't understand this viewpoint at all. Do you only have one character on your account? and even if you do, do you only ever have one the cosmetic look for them?
---
I saw a 'Kim Charrdashian' the other day.
---
I figured I'd share this since I saw some people request it in another post.
---
  
---
Sorry for the clicky noises!
---
As someone who just got back to GW and the last festival they remember is dragon bash, I already have these wings. Should I just be selling those coffers? Anything else cool in there?
---
I'm guessing when you get material drops, you just deposit them to your material storage? Generally when people talk about rates of gold generation for some activity, they're looking it at it from the perspective assuming you sell everything that drops on the TP.
---
not everything can be the best gph.
---
According to you and &lt;10% of the player base
---
DirectX 12 requires Windows 10.
---
the difference being that you can only buy this with ingame resources.
---
If you still have the crash.txt and log.txt files come onto the Discord and share them.
---
Thanks. I'm considering it since I enjoy the lore. Not sure why I'm getting downvoted :P
---
There are two account bound super rare drops and one tradeable super rare drop that will easily fetch thousands of gold.
---
The rest of the loot table is basically balanced around these so the overwhelming majority of the stuff you get will be disappointing. Crack them open if you're feeling lucky or sell them for a flat price if you're looking to turn a profit without the gamble.
---
Just bet on all 5 of them 10 times and you are done.
---
Dragon Bash has annual achievements now.
---
Why not just raid more? You will get a truckload of ascended gear and the means to get more with much less hassle than grinding for mats.
---
sound like there is a daily limit then, shame its so low.
---
Kitty tested it for certainty and it seems to work atm (just like Kitty's been observing for a while). https://youtu.be/uTaLbD3aoqU
---
Necro (as scourge) and firebrand are both fine for raids. A raid squads needs 1 druid for its buffs, but a 2nd one is not necessary so every other healer can fill this role (druid's important abilities affect 10 people). They bring different utility but they're both great.
---
For fractals, the meta is chrono+druid or ren+fb, the firebrand usually being the healer. However this only really applies to endgame fractals, you can run heal necro for 99% of fractal content. Necro means slower clears than fb in experienced groups but it's the best class to carry players struggling and dying due to OP rez.
---
ANet: We need something to sell at the Gemstore.
---
Random Dev: why not turn around the horns we already sold them and sell them again?
---
PROMOTED
---
whats wrong with one handed swords?
---
theres is current 3 ways to get them, either buy it from TP, buy it from feastival vendor for 100 Jorbreakers for get it from black lion commemorative sockets for 20 sockets
---
Sometimes stuff loads alittle slow (GTX 2060) but all in all, wow man this is amazing!!!! You deserve a big chocolate chip cookie 😁😁😁, well maybe a job at GW... Game runs so good now it's not even funny...
---
Balance was ok, someday, but have a big amount of flawed mechanics that powercreeped e specs bringed to ridiculous levels for a pvp game(thinks like being rewarded for play in safemode extra long range by damage increased by distance ( ranger lb and mes gs), stealth abuse,too many instaports, too many oneshot, too many big area denial skills,classes that can facetank big amounts of dmg living in a pve style skill rotation with no preocupation to what enemy throws to him, classes with a trucload of cc while in almost perma sta... etc)
---
My comment was more about area not being profitable enough for you. Not every festival need to be lab farm profitable. 
---
&gt;other things way way more lucrative.
---
This may shock you but getting ingame currency does not have to be the primary drive for playing a video game at all times.
---
Sorry I stand corrected from my first reply. I was only aware of her YouTube videos.
---
I shall check out the site ty
---
Oh god. I was going to check it out. Is it all bright, blinky, flashy and sparkling?
---
You're either a giant troll or the reason I avoid the rp scene.
---
Actaually, a weaver can blink as well, so most skips can be done without a chrono! The only only chrono can do is on cliff side, which saves about 30 seconds, but that is nothing compared to the time saved in a firebrigade comp by dps increase buffs.
---
Also, many other builds have pulls, notably firebrand, dh, and soulbeast.
---
Firebrigade is objectively better than any chrono comp. however, chrono is still viable and useful.
---
I destroyed around 50 pinatas yesterday. I think that I've joined different map and they were up again
---
For fractals condi is bad, it takes too to kill bosses and fast phases. Open world everything works
---
What sprocket? And where do you convert it?
---
How bad is the actual recipe though?
---
Just wait it’ll eventually happen. I stopped playing before mid season balance patches. Just not my thing.
---
You want to stack up a lot of burn in a short time for open world. So a bit of quickness up time here and there will be fine.
---
In Fractal you might consider your self a trash mob puller.  So get a back up GS for some fight like Siren Reef , Mai Tarin
---
yes its true. Its weekly vendor, meaning it has weekly reset and maybe items will change next week. We dont know that yet, but at this point you can get 50 map currency per jorbreaker unknown times this week.
---
I meant to say that the ones which are broken show that message. The ring one is probably broken.
---
If you wanna to do fractals and open world then the game is just fine. WvW and PvP is currently bleeding outdue to lack of impactful balance updates and bots - it's still playable if don't take it too seriously. If you want to do raids then I'd recommend to look for another mmo.
---
They are called entitled pricks :)
---
Once you smash them, they are empty.
---
Totally agree... Would like to do that a lot, even if it requires to do a little quest and earning the title "Inquest member" or anything similar "mad scientist..."
---
Wow! So finally they must have fixed the well known eternal problem with skill lag in WvW, that they are adding new mechanics which may worsen it even more. Great! To be honest, I didn't expect that.
---
bummer
---
Oh, I wonder why these ones are broken. I saw a note on the wiki recently that some items can’t be linked without owning them. I hope that’s the case here. Would really be inconvenient if I wanted to show someone my gear and couldn’t link it.
---
[This topic](https://i.imgur.com/1QquQ.jpg)
---
I was about to say that since the content is old, they are probably assuming that you're experienced enough, however I'd still not justify their actions.
---
However, since it's possible to see agony resistance of group members, I'd simply call them ignorant and entitled.
---
The best way to avoid these situations is to be more specific in LFG about what you're doing.
---
I think you are right, Goodbye Duncan, Thank you for being us
---
lmaoooo
---
Stop trying Anet. We won't fall for it.
---
Bye!
---
In the first example I think you got a troll.
---
In the second one the problem could be the same problem as newer players have by not reading what is written there. They already did the content and just "want it to be over" to do something else so they rush.
---
In the third example it is probably because some players think they are infallible, which I don't really blame them for believing that since the game doesn't give you a way to know but complaining about others while not doing that what they complain about others makes them a hypocrite.
---
I don't think you need to understand it if they behave like this then say you are sorry but they don't fit into your group and then kick them. Block them if they whisper you.
---
The point of this video is to show warclaws can be bloodthirsty creatures in WvW.
---
lol
---
They aren't an achievement reward. You can buy them at a vendor. Check properly before assuling you got "fucked over". ;)
---
How do you get your cursor to look like that? I always struggle to find my cursor for ground targeting stuff!
---
Thank you for this amazing addon! My performance really got much better.. I also wanted to ask if anyone with a ryzen processor could tell me which settings in the config I should play around to see if I can get any more improvements on my 2700x.
---
1st Dragon Bash: Ashford dies  
---
2nd Dragon Bash: Whitebear dies  
---
...  
---
Maybe we should stop the festival
---
Ah, fair enough. Post had three answers at the time I answered as well.
---
Well if your character has a greatsword and the backstab animation is played, the animation will be clunky.
---
Same of course with the rapidshot animation played with a hammer in hand. ;)
---
Can i get royalties for allowing them to use my name?
---
Pchrono in fractal has a too slow burst compared to Weaver and DH and will be really great in pug group but less in static group. It can grants a lot of skips through blink and portal though, which is nice if people know what you plan to do
---
What, people do fractals before 80? I never did that except to powerlevel/give masteries to an alt account
---
For the raid one I would call them something like Holier than tho, or my shit dont stink, or everyone else is the problem but never me kind of people. Even if they are shit tier players that get carried they see that as justification for how good they are even if their corpse was carried across the finish line.
---
For dungeons it could just simply be they have zero awareness for where the grp is and dont realize how far ahead they are and are not able to actually solo things. They just expect everyone to be just a little behind them. Or maybe they think they are doing everyone else a favour by trying to solo the whole thing even if they are not always able to follow through on that.
---
The fractal one my guess is they are coming in trying to take over the group to get what they want done ie higher tier of fractals. Reading lfg is hard at every level of the game. Could also be good ole fashioned trolling.
---
I dont think any of the behaviour you described here fall under elitism. Maybe the raid one but I think of those people more as idiots(it can just be in the moment) and blamer's. This all of course imo.
---
Yea I couldn't get more than 27 either, and I don't think the path allows it. Only other two are out in the boonies &gt;.&lt;
---
How many u need for gold?
---
19
---
I'd think only chrono can solo the thaumanova button/turret room too - I can usually get that and the heatroom done more or less as the pugs have finished doors and got to slime (since nobody fuckin volunteers to do heatroom)
---
If it follows suit with the SAB reward vendor it will not change. It will be the same set of items each week.
---
&gt; buy it from feastival vendor for 100 Jorbreakers
---
That would be the regular one, but even then does no one have a issue with that? 100 Jorbreakers at 20g a pop is 2000g. Sure, you can buy the back piece off the TP for 50g but the 100 is *how you earn it from the event*. If you want the shattered one its 25 jorbreakers(500g). I seem to be the only sane one in the game to think this is pure insanity that these items are so expensive.
---
F
---
Pissed away 400g myself the other day. Dont know why I still bother, I have the portable version that I use to sell junk, and that journey cost me about 1000g (I recorded all my hands so I could could tell the 'cost' of it). 
---
Every now and then I cuy 2 hands, lose terrible and vow never again.......until I try again.
---
Zhaitasty tier 5 is consume 5000
---
And csplit works too
---
horn, staff, and torch looks cool.
---
I sure hope it doesn't mean someone did 28. I really don't know how that would even humanly be possible haha.
---
We should all install ts and join his server to celebrate.
---
Yea actually, I'm trying to wrap my head around 28, and I can't come up with anything. The only two that we didn't grab are up top behind the first tables. No time to grab them anywhere.
---
Hahaha “my shit dont stink”!!! Amazing description! Anyway, I agree with most of what u said :)
---
Theres two more pinatas at Sigfast's Steading, the snowy patch NW in Shelter Rock
---
&gt; That would be the regular one, 
---
Ye, already been corrected on that in another comment.
---
&gt; I seem to be the only sane one in the game to think this is pure insanity that these items are so expensive. 
---
you can just trade 1000 zhaitaffy for a jorbreaker and at the rate i was casually getting zhaitaffy last night (several hundred in less than an hour of just wandering around) then its not that hard to do it, so unless that amount suddenly tapers off then it should be easier enough to get the resources need, or you can use one of the other options to get it, like the sprockets (which is how i got it ages ago)
---
There are the holographic precursor and a holographic helmet, maybe there is more.
---
https://discretize.eu/guides/consumables
---
Updated it. Thanks!
---
Maybe next time we are allowed to unwrap them?
---
You can. But if you care about gold its currently better to sell taffy and coffers. and convert them once they drop in price.
---
Condi fb is ok for fractals since it’s actually a bursty condi class, but still outclassed by meta power dps builds.
---
Power soulbeast is a great example of meta power dps. I would heavily encourage you to gear it, as you’ll be able to use it even for hardcore speed runs. Don’t gear condi slb for fractals though.
---
I try to be as descriptive in LFG as I can...got lots of experience by now xD 
---
It’s better overall, but still on occasion it seems to not make any difference. I’ve updated the main post with what dps meter I use and how I generally perform in raids :)
---
To be fair, the raid example happens a lot more and generally those ppl just leave and we end up looking for new ppl. This ends up being better overall because the group slowly becomes better at communicating and less toxic. That is how I managed my first raid VG and how I consistently continue to complete raids. It can sometimes take a looong time before a group is decent. And sometimes it’s great from the get go. It’s luck and chance I guess.
---
\^ Just as said. There are also some vendors selling other stuffs with jorbreaker too. But I just listed what achievements are here.
---
Oh yes I know, ty anyways
---
Idk if it's true but someone ingame said that there is a daily acc cap of 25 dragon chests(from the arena at least)
---
I'll have it on mind, no idea on how to get dyes but I supose is like ESO (achievements)
---
Yolomouse
---
Hey I wanted to share with you that I managed 29 Pinatas in Pinata Bashing! I am currently trying to improve my time and it would be nice if you can give me some tipps :)
---
&gt; all the wait just to get fked over lmao
---
.
---
&gt; how to get those jorbreaker ?
---
You really need to learn to use the wiki.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Holographic_Dragon_Wing_Cover
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jorbreaker
---
Thank you so much, I can run best settings at like 40fps now! It was like a slideshow before.
---
for some reason it worked fine in another browser 🤷‍♀️
---
i really miss the time before they added ultra-rare expensive items to these things... nobody can open them except for the folks who buy them up by the 10s of thousands, just trying to get the rare item
---
good thing you linked the wrong wings ;)
---
NOW TO CANTHA!
---
Look it up in the wiki. Full ingredients list and current TP cost.
---
Glad it helps :D
---
'loot box' as a phrase has acquired a popular negative definition of "something you pay money to open in addition to the cost of the game". BL chests are kind of that, but not exactly the same since you can buy gems with in-game gold.
---
LUL
---
You welcome \^\^
---
Some people are just insufferable, selfish jerks.
---
Consider the gold that you could farm in the time you saved. Opportunity cost.
---
Wait wait wait, holddd up

Leeching bolts, LEECHING. Got you? Or you have never met any no-dps necro leecher?
---
Nice, I did a different a slightly different route for my 27, but still basically the same. A 28 seems unlikely though.
---
Me neither. Only see the 2 week one
---
If you want to relax while doing the fire works achievement just use auto attack. 
---
Saves a lot of clicking.
---
Your count is wrong. You need 4 more greys.

---
I had trouble with ground targeting the second skill to some pinatas so I used action camera and it worked fairly well for this adventure.
---
It's port hack most likely.
---
That or he has an impressive list of friends with portals/gimmicks.
---
&gt; CAN YOU STOP FALLING OFF THE PLATFORMS FOR ONCE?!
---
Wow, is that a thing?
---
So, i wouldn't say that condi firebrand is "good" for fractals. Out of all condi builds it is probably the best though as your condis ramp up pretty quickly and you get a decent amount of resets on your f1 because there are lots of trash mobs.
---
With that being said, it is probably worse than any viable power build. It's worse than dh, weaver, tempest, holo, reaper, soulbeast, chrono, daredevil and dagger deadeye. It is better than rifle deadeye as it has pretty much only single target dmg which is suboptimal in most fractals. I'm not sure about power warrior professions but i reckon they're also stronger than condi firebrand.
---
Now, if you are just starting out you can play whatever you want. Also, if you join casual t4 groups you will also do fine. Very few groups would kick you.
---
One more thing about firebrand is that you can use a quickness oriented build without losing too much dps. The dps loss is definitely noticable but given that you can provide perma quickness to 5 people while still doing competetive dps makes firebrand really good for fractals. However, power fb fills exactly the same role while providing more damage and arguably more utility (gs5 pull). 
---
Regarding open world, do whatever you want. If you enjoy condi firebrand then go for it.
---
I pugged it and there were a couple guys who were consistently failing to use a tornado to avoid the shockwaves. Baffling. They are a set percentages and have like a 5 second charge up time.
---
&gt; Are some ppl elitist or just trolling?
---
Yes.
---
easier.. just buy with gold or when it comes around via gemstore
---
You still have to do dailies:-P
---
Can someone /r/OutOfTheLoop that one?
---
but when you attack a zergling back in a 1v1 THATS ganking
---
I could, if I could be bothered xD, it would take 5 minutes tops, and then sell and PROFIT XD
---
&gt;Condi  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Fractals
---
No.
---
Yep, profit is great, so many coffers with alts:-)
---
No, no! You start with "Wow! That's quality markers!", and then *others* reply with "Thank you so much."
---
It doesn't matter, condi/power on T4. Try this build and play if you like it, don't listen meta guys. CMs are only for power builds.
---
Download, installed, started game, crashed, removed.
---
Good thing you made a post about something that would take 1 second to find out with the wiki.
---
One search and u can see that the shattered wings are purchasable for jorbreakers and from season 1 memory box currency. Both are fairly expensive but the item in question did have alot of prestige during its release.
---

No. No arguing, you put your pillar and remeber where it is. Your pair doesnt even care where the pillar is, thet care where you are. If you cant remember one small thing, maybe you shouldnt raid and aa gerent instead.
---
Congrats!!
---
If I buy through steam, do I buy the trilogy+eye of the north for the updated "all one in one" thing they released last year?
---
I don't remember. I watched one video guide and then killed it in the 2nd attempt in a non KP pug. Something like x5% or something I think (like 85%, 65%, don't remember exactly).
---
I didn't meant they should rework the old content, just make all those dialogues live from the beginning when they were making it.
---
Can we say that was all about the budget?
---
Nice man!
---
Erwin is infamous for port hacking, that is why I am surprised about his time
---
No they probably didn't think about it until HoT. Simple as that. Just like they probably didn't think about the living world concept till 2013, or the story journal for living world till 2014.
---
Thanks Tekkit!  You rock!
---
Budget nevermore
---
You're not wrong - I am super lazy with adventures lol
---
Is this Asuna? What's your playtime in total?
---
Why?
---
When I bought the bundles, I paid for 5 mount skins.
---
Other than "free stuff is awesome!", what's the thinking?
---
How do you convert them to Zhaitaffy?
---
There are ~2 big Speedclear alliances and also 2 big gvg alliances. So less than 1000 active "endgame" players - but both communities are very dedicated but also elitist.
---
There is a 1500+ Member casual guild called [LGiT] they do everything there is.
---
Noone can make guesses about the open world population, thanks to heroes this part of the game has been turned into a single player experience. This is a very enjoyable way to play the game for like 400-1000 hours; you can beat pretty much every Pve content there is with heros and get all the titles if that is what you are after.
---
The main trading hub (Kamadan) is still "kind of" busy.
---
The game is "dead" in the publics eyes but still enough activity left to make anyones stay worthwhile :)
---
Yeah it's me, almost 25k hours
---
These are all holo versions of the gen 1 legendary precursors. So that sword is bolt, without the lightning. I agree it's an ugly sword, but they couldn't really change it based on the theme.

Why not make 4 Legos??

I understand your point, Thankyou.

---
Sadly, in the Guild Wars 2 community, constructive criticism or a difference of opinion often results in people going huffy, refusing to talk or discuss with you and then labelling you as toxic for suggesting that things aren't working or holding different perspectives.
---
It is a bit of a shame and people refusing to compromise, discuss viewpoints, extend maturity or even critically analyse data is becoming more prevalent both in the game and outside it as seen in the deteriorating political climate (particularly here in the UK).
---
I did it with some guildies last night. Just two rounds of the 5 man, has the last boss at 10 stacks. Pretty easy.
---
Oh boi
---
My goal to make one of every guild decoration surely became a lot harder with this update.
---
I didn't post my best time :P my best is 23seconds so far. When my friends come online I will try sub 20
---
I just don't get it. I joined a group and after a while I asked our chrono why it takes like 10 seconds into the fight until we get our first quickness and I swear, if we all had been sitting at a table I would have recieved at least 7 disgusted glances as if I had taken a dump on the table.
---
I have a question about ecto gambling - let me preface it by saying that I realize it's not a good idea to gamble, even in the game :)
---
However, I would like to ask, is there any difference between buying Destabilized Ectoplasm in Lion's Arch and Sandstorm Hands in Crystal Oasis?
---
I see that there is a very expensive achievement for the second one, but is there a difference in potential money earned/lost?
---
You have my upvote, sir. Too bad I had my friend get to 80lvl before I knew that. ʅ（◞‿◟）ʃ
---
Oh thank you!
---
Not really unique to GW2. As with everything, it's in the delivery. 
---
Are you calling someone out publicly during the raid? Won't be taken well. 
---
Are you privately messaging them after raid and offering help with gear/rotations? Much more likely to be taken well.
---
I have every legendary armor, wep, backpiece and trinket/ring in the game already
---
Like the wiki? You know the thing you can access from in game with /wiki and it has player made guides for pretty much everything....
---
I am pretty think there are 3 mechanics tied to his health, which are:
---
* the CC phases
---
* the large tornado (50%)
---
* the air elemental adds (40%)
---
Both of his shockwaves (updraft and shield dome) happen after every few normal attacks and never during a CC phase.
---
If i want a different look i can just use different dyes.
---
There is no trait for warhorns in the reaper line. Blood magic has one that decreases cooldown and increases duration of warhorn skills.
---
Maybe you misread the adept trait that let's shouts siphon health? Warhorn skills are no shouts. Shouts are utility skills.
---
Everyone death stares you \*\_\*
---
Well, but I completely understand your feel. In a group I joined, the commander keeps dying, I had to restrain myself not to sigh audibly on discord whenever there's a failed updraft...
---
Wow that's basically a full time job with 0 vacation, that's an amazing dedication.
---
Fuck man, a casual raiding guild.
---
Can I join?
---
In GW2 people think you are toxic if you say something like "can you take Xera closer to the Heart marker?"  OR "Druid, don't forget your green" OR "someone had the bomb and didn't through South."  I swear, people in this community are the most sensitive bunch of ninnies I have ever seen.  Most of the "toxic raiders" aren't even toxic, at all they are merely pointing out mistakes so they aren't made again on the next pull but the GW2 playerbase gets all huffy at anyone saying they did something wrong and immediately cry "TOXIC"
---
does anyone possibly have just a map with a drawn route that is effective at getting gold? videos are hard for me to follow
---
Well most of them have matching gliders so there’s that.
---
They eventually discarded the HoT method too. After hot, characters no longer had facial animations matching the voicing and instead got the generic lip flap seen anywhere else. Looks like that took too long to do too.
---
Both solutions wouldn't be a waste!
---
Becasue saying "your tanking was not good" is toxic.  It's not constructive in any way.
---
Telling someone they are bad is rarely if ever going to improve them.  People aren't bad by choice, they are bad because they don't know how to do it better.
---
Why sugarcoat it? I will not say
---
Hey, sweety. I know you are trying your best but you seem to are have problems with this mechanic. We will be a very happy when everyone is alive after Sadir does the shockwave attack. So tell me, what can we do for you so that you will also make it? 
---
No. Afer explaining more than once that the shockwave attack get's indicated by the boss spining and already releasing small non damaging waves it is time to either walk to a tornado or use the SAK that teleports you to it. The tornados follow the white pattern on the floor and go all either anti clockwise or clockwise.
---
On non-CM Sabir we just resorted to a single Healbrand bringing all the projectile reflects/destroys he can (which is a lot). Add one or two Feedbacks from the Chrono/Mirage and you don't really have to deal with the adds.
---
With the launch content (so Personal Story and dungeons), they went with the cutscene approach, because I think they felt it was more "cinematic" and you could better see characters' animations and expressions, compared to the normal zoomed out view when you play.
---
However, that was apparently a massive PITA to actually put together, so when they got to Living Story, where they aimed to update every two weeks, they dropped it.  However, iirc, they said that, at the time, their tech literally didn't support the player character speaking, except for in those cutscenes, or in response to very specific triggers like picking up an item, or activating a skill.  Additionally, with the 10 voices they'd have to record (one per race and gender combo), and the writing team's tendency at the time to tweak stuff right up until release, they felt it was impractical to call in 10 VAs every two weeks to record lines.
---
With HoT however, they had a lot of time to get their tech in order, and to finalize all the writing ahead of time, so we got the new style, and with Living Story's move to bigger releases every 3-4 months, instead of every two weeks, they now felt it to be more worthwhile to continue giving our commander a voice.  The old content is still the way it is, because they rarely go back and revisit old content, and frankly, most of the playerbase probably thinks going back to redo all the old cutscene would be a waste of time.
---
Every single patch is an opportunity to make gold. 
---
Think of it this way. What items can you buy now that will grow in value over time?
---
What will be more valuable in the near future?
---
Here's an example of a speculation success I had recently.  When I heard there was a new raid coming out I immediately grabbed a stack of every meta raid food, and a couple sets of scholar runes and a few force / impact sigils. I knew that they would have a temporary spike in demand as people were trying the new wing. 
---
Waited for prime time, prices increased, made myself a good little profit off of it. 
---
You have to do that sort of thing, know what's coming and know what people will need for it.
---
I was wondering what it reminded me of, and, yeah.
---
On the way? Last word I can find is merely a mention they're "still on the table"
---
But cutscenes can be skipped!
---
Oh thank you, didn't realize it while looking at wiki. So clearly, the desert one has to be better, since mystic forge stuff is very cheap? 
---
Also I realized there's an achievement for the LA one too.
---
Anet confirmed that they are working on Build Templates in the "whats on horizon" letter, after the layoffs happened.
---
I have cleared every single raid boss, done every fractal, done all the story, and map completed on condition firebrand. It's a strong class if you know how to play it
---
Account I believe
---
["Over the past few months, astute players have been noticing a trend of updates and improvements to how our skill-slotting system works and have accurately speculated that the long-requested feature of build templates is in the works."](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/)
---
gz.
---
I'm a bit late on you, gonna reach it on my main account in the next few days I think. And before the end of the festival on my 2nd :D
---
I don't know, the Weapon swap button is especially for swapping weapons in combat, adding this with the same button just for two Professions would lead to massive confusion AND would be horrible for WvW, break combat swap weapons and maw your enemy down.
---
And then why only those two profession and not everyone else? And why then only one weapon set and not both?
---
After 25k hours I'd assume he has all the shiny he could want
---
...he says, having DH flair equipped
---
Grats fish!
---
how many copies of the Zenith weapon skins do u have lol. Do the chests still only give u 2G when ur that high up or is it 4G?
---
That seems way too overcomplaicted and unnecessary lol
---
&gt; would be horrible for WvW, break combat swap weapons and maw your enemy down.
---
What's the difference to opening inventory and doubleclicking one or two weapons? We already can do it, but with the weapon swap button it would simply be more convinient.
---
Is this passive aggressively calling someone passive aggressive? My head hurts.
---
I’ve already told u what my position is generally in dps (using arcdps) when I use my warrior. It’s pointless to give dps numbers. 
---
When I’m with my healer druid, dps doesn’t matter so much and I try my best to maintain the highest dps I can, which is maybe around 6k fully buffed and with food/utility and a good team. That’s because I’m spamming healing which is greater than 6k per second and support boons.
---
If u exclusively want to know my warrior’s dps since it’s a pdps class, then ur specific question is still meaningless because I could mislead you and say around 28k dps. A useless number I get against golem which doesn’t fight back with all buffs maxed. How most, if not all ppl gauge their builds. Which is completely useless in a real fight generally. I use my own build, which is not a meta build but it’s a close spinoff of a meta build and I enjoy playing it more. Plus I got it as close as I could to 30k dps against a stationary golem so that it’s viable for raiding.
---
I could give you the number I achieve with absolutely zero buffs, food/utility and only using self sustained abilities, which is anything around 10k dps.
---
I could give you a more realistic number, which I achieve in raids or high level fractals with a good team and food/utility, which is around 17k dps.
---
These number don’t translate to much. Where as if I tell u I’m in the top 3 out of a 10 person team dealing the highest dps that means something. 
---
U can’t do anything with the dps information I gave u. U have to play a fractal/raid to see what numbers I pull. Furthermore, if anything else, guild wars teaches ppl that builds take u part of the way, experience does the rest. I’ve seen ppl following meta builds and following rotations and still failing. Because it’s not just click-click-click type of gameplay.
---
Excluding the twitch slang by which I immediately assume the one speaking is your average 16 year old twitch toxic wanna be popular kid, this is not constructive criticism in any way shape or form. You just make a statement with 0 meaning behind it aimed at someone. If you want to be constructive do it in normal proper human way and language and not in half meme/slang.
---
This is the problem with you people.  Telling me i'm doing something wrong is doing *nothing* to fix that behavior.  Again, I am not doing it wrong by choice. I am doing it wrong because that's the best I have found and learned.
---
Tell me how to do it correctly, don't just say you are bad and you are doing it wrong.
---
I'm doing it the best way I have tried to find out how to and learn how to.  So unless someone else intervenes with specifics of how to improve, there wont be any improvement.
---
Haha ok I wanna share my last try to do runs with a none toxic casual guild. We kept wiping at VG countless times and I started feeling like shown in the image. After the last wipe I pointed out to the healer, in the kindest way imagineable, that she should save her burst heal for after the greens hit because ppl kept dying there. But instead of taking my advise she stared shouting at me, telling me I what a fucking noob I was (I had more LI than most players in that group) and that I should stop flaming her lmao. I just left the group and the channel like wtf man.
---
With all the people making multiple suggestions, I'd like to just go for one.
---
Thief. Run P/P for vanilla content, Staff for HoT+. Bow in the backbar for the shadowstep, since you can't mount up until PoF. 
---
P/P 3 does insane damage on demand, which is all you really need in story content. Staff for cleaving or AoE. You can switch out the bow for something else once you reach PoF since you can just mount up.
---
If you have the Path of Fire expansion you can also go into WvW to unlock the Warclaw. This wont be as fast as the raptor but will be faster than you normal running speed. You can use it outside of WvW and might be easier to obtain than the raptor if you are not level 80 yet.
---
Bless you.
---
why? wtf is wrong with anet lately? at least let us do the achievement
---
It's the easiests you can go with, unless you have SC level of dps.
---
I don't think you can go easier than having marked pairs and have people work as 4 teams of 2, not one of 8
---
Mark 5 ppl with marks. Mark 5 spots on the ground matching people's marks. Profit.
---
Not buying gems.
---
Well I only pugged it anyways and it seems so far just using your eyes, going to a free pillar and ressing any who fail with scourge works fine than trying to get pugs to communicate
---
&gt; Pointing out that something isn't going well and then also reaching out to help or give advice
---
Escept this is NOT what I replied about.
---
He simply said that he said "your tanking was not good".   That is NOT reaching out and helping or giving advice.  "you are not good" is NOT help or advice.
---
Condi Firebrand is actually pretty much the only condi build that's reasonable in fractals, because your condis ramp up really quick, and you still output solid power damage, so it actually has the burst necessary to hang.  Dragonhunter, or Quickbrand, would still be better, but if you run a condi Firebrand (ideally with Grieving gear) you'll be fine in fractals with most groups. 
---
For open world, Grieving Firebrand is great too.  You have good power damage still, so you do well even against the few enemies immune to burning (pretty much just a few destroyers) and you can also kill objects in core Tyria at a reasonable pace, unlike most condi builds.  It's really nice in the expansion zones too, because you have both good burst, and good DoT, so if you get spiked down by mobs, (super common in HoT zones) often the DoTs will finish off the enemy to get you a rally.
---
Don't forget getting insta-kicked (probably blocked) and then having rumours and nonsense spread about you to their friends and guildies...huh...it's almost like real life. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
On one hand, I do believe you are interpreting it as more hostile than it is. Telling you you're doing it wrong is doing one thing to fix it: it's telling you that whatever you're doing it wrong. And then you can ask *how* you're doing wrong, and you can explain *why* you were doing it that way.
---
On the other hand, I do believe some people can come across as more hostile than they intend to. Tone, perceived or not, does matter sometimes, and I completely understand that some people may not be willing to listen to someone they believe is disparaging them in some way.
---
Well, yes. If someone immediately blocks someone that is pointing out issues or raising concerns they aren't going to get the help that comes afterwards or with those problems being noted.
---
That behaviour in itself is toxic. Shut down being told there are problems, don't learn to improve but keep throwing yourself into group content where people depend on you and would hope for discussion if you were struggling.
---
i think what he meant is that people which are not regulary doing t4's are not used to playing any comp with support / boon classes and generally do not stick together, making it very hard to play support chrono to full potential, basically just crippeling yourself.  
---
you see all kind of shit in terms of ranging and running arround like a headless chicken.  
---
on the other side, there are many chronos which only do their baseline job and do not share blocks to the group at the right time so you can just do your brainafk dps job, but have to dodge mechanics.
---
I've seen my fair share of overlapping pillars ...
---
That's when you expect your people to have at least one whole brain each. OP is in a casual raiding guild, you can't go with pug strats there from the start because you can't assume they that they have skills necessary.
---
Already have all zenith. After 32k i think you get Pinnacle skins, or was it 36k I can't remember. Yes the chests still suck
---
Pretty nice, although the lack of waypoints in routes makes it take much much longer than it should be, that long walk from the west side of the map to the NE.
---
Exactly 40000 nice. Congratulations. Will try same when i get there, at the moment 38594. My biggest problem is raids, can't get 'late access' (without kill prove) to decent wing 5-7 runs. 410 ap 'hidden there'. Other achievements i'm doing very good at the moment, finishing some annoying old ones.
---
That was quick. Wow, big thanks !!!
---
&gt;Why sugarcoat it? I will not say
---
you are toxic. reflect on yourself and your interactions with others. focus on empathy.
---
You cal tap the gyfcat link by the post on mobile and open the actual gyfcat link.
---
It’s linked to not participating enough in the events. Try to not follow the zerg so you deal more overall damage
---
as someone with about the same amount of playtime: leaving gw2 running in the background, like all the time, plays a big role in that. i personally maybe play an hour a day these days, but if my pc is on gw2 is running, and thats like 7h+ per day
---
It says "Returning This Week" so it will pop up some day soon, just not with the initial Dragon Bash release.
---
Then it takes just 1ap to mess up that perfect round number
---
I want rifle Rangers so bad
---
Yeah I would say at least 8000 of my hours are AFK if not more.
---
I agree, but I still found it funny when I saw it :D
---
I agree.  As long as there is some sort of offer for help or suggestions about what they can try.  But yeah I know phrasing can easily turn people off and I think it's just unnecessary to flat out say "bad" or "not good".  Just say something like "could be improved".
---
Don't say: "you are bad, do this instead."
---
Say: "your play could use some improvement, try this"
---
She's on her own with her own crew. Definitely far from what we get with Canach and Rytlock. We're missing an Elonian *who actually lives there* who introduces us to their customs and culture.
---
We rush into a foreign country and we don't befriend even a single local. Decades fighting against the awakened and the branded, and suddenly some foreigners come in and just do whatever the fuck they want without even asking the people who live there.
---
If you ask me, Duncan should have replaced Kasmeer in the PoF story. Badass holosmith priest of Kormir, who introduces us to the local factions (who are weary of foreigners). Maybe part of his family had been awakened as well, adding depth to his storyline. Maybe he hates Archon Iberu, for personal reasons. Maybe he knows Vlast and he's the one to tell us about him.
---
This "save Elona, without Elonians" thing is pretty lame, but hey, that's just me.
---
I missed so many pinatas yesterday, wow.  Thanks for this!
---
Mmmm, that makes sense. Guess I'm too eager lol Though I'm having second guesses since I already have a sanctuary pass....
---
&gt; Why sugarcoat it?
---
Becasue you will get a more positive response from more people if you do.
---
In teaching we have the opportunity to deliver feedback and feed forward in a way that praises as well as points out and addresses faults. Unfortunately, unless you have the world's most patient raid group you don't exactly have time to do a two stars and a wish breakdown of all players and all events that go wrong.
---
I'd disagree with the distinction between "bad" and "not good". "Bad" means "bad". Not good implies you aren't at the top of your game currently, thereby playing "good". It's average. Mediocre could use some work. However, the poster you are referring to did not use "bad" so that isn't pertinent in this case.
---
Did we skip the part where I suggested load times and costs for some players impacts the ability to participate in this event --or-- did we feel that making a post that doesn't contribute to solving the problem that players are experiencing was more important? Waypointing isn't the problem here for any one.
---
and no pay
---
If you are getting blocked, it's because of how you are going about saying things.  Not because of trying to help others improve.  I can assure you that.
---
You said you wont sugar coat it.  You need to, or at least a little.
---
Either keep not sugar coating it and keep getting blocked, or learn to say things to people in a way that doesn't cause them to block you.
---
The choice is yours.  It's up to you if you want to improve your messaging to get more positive responses from more people in order to improve your raiding experience and decrease your frustration.
---
I hope you see how contradictory you are being.
---
You say things like this and then you also ask how you can help others if you keep getting blocked...
---
"We don't need Jacaranda here. Bring a hard cc pet"

Cheerful Ingester is 10 ap and 3 coffers, 11 tiers and takes 3000 to max. For future reference, all AP, tiers, rewards, and number of objectives information is available in the hero panel by hovering over different UI elements. Only exception is locked or hidden achievements, but that doesn't apply here.
---
I hope the next necromancer elite specialization gets pistol/pistol, together with a "mad scientist" theme and a plague doctor mask. Call it the **Apothecary**, and give him some poison bombs and elixirs.
---
[Pretty much this.](https://shovelknight.fandom.com/wiki/Plague_Knight)
---
And you need like what 300 hearts + for Gen 1 legendary?
---
It's also about the people though. If people are arrogant an unwilling to learn (like I know some of my friends sometimes are..) then it's going to be tough to improve.
---
Being open to criticism should be a raid requirement. I got called out a lot in other games for raiding. And it made me damned good in the roles I aspired to fullfill. 
---
That said, I haven't tasted a lot of gw2 raiding yet. I just don't want to invest the effort right now, but I assume my point translates to raiding (or endgame pve) in general rather than specific titles and scenario's.
---
Heh, the second paragraph was my attempt in showcasing how passive aggressive their communication style comes across.
---
Congratz! I bet that feels good now, having that done :-P I bet the last 10k felt eternally slow :-P
---
One day I'll get 30k, and be happy abut that :-)
---
Iam pretty sure the special action key takes about 15% of the bar. It definitely doesn't take 25%.

no your attitude and approach to the world is toxic. you refuse to make any effort to put civility into the way you approach and interact with people and expect them to respond positively to you. you have placed yourself on a pedestal and as the sole center of your universe. 
---
A non-toxic approach is to see that the other persons time is bad, then think about why it may be. they are either not great and could use some advice, ignorant and could use some information, etc. remember the this is a game for everyone's enjoyment and take the half beat to approach it in a less aggressive way. don't make them feel bad because you are upset. your issues are yours don't put them on others. instead try approaching it with a question like hey chrono what rotation are you using... have you seen this great video on it. etc. encourage them to get better and provide tools to help them. don't just dump on them because they shattered your perfect world.
---
Do you have UD?

Mention it once, give warning the second time and kick on the third. Problem solved.
---
You get 10 out of it. So it's slightly cheaper to craft than to instantbuy right now. Ordering is cheaper than crafting.
---
-\&gt; They were too specific when describing the problem, and I'm worried it makes GW2 look bad, so I'm going to harshly criticize a post by pretending it's belittling, and compare it to pissing on a war memorial, no matter how hyperbolic. Then I'm going to correct it to make myself look like the rational middle-man. Yeah, that should make it look bad! 
---
See, I can paraphrase too!
---
&gt;"The game is rewarding to very casual gameplay, but suffers from lack of difficult and challenging endgame elements"
---
No, the problem isn't that it's "rewarding to casual gameplay".  Casual just means someone doesn't have a lot of time to play, and sometimes doesn't require one to utilize elite stategies. In other words, bite-sized content that anyone can clear if they put in the effort and respects your time. In a casual game, content is designed in such a way that it can be learned easily and beaten.
---
For examples, Super Smash Bros is a casual game. Super Mario is a casual game. Wii Sports and Wii Fit are a casual games. Candy Crush is a casual game. Angry Birds is a casual game. 
---
These things are all considered casual games because they require a little time investment in order to join in the fun. You can easily learn their mechanics within just a few minutes, and enjoy them in bite sized sessions,
---
Casual does **not** means something that you cannot fail, nor' does it mean its rewards effortless gameplay.  
---
If anything, I would argue GW2 is not a casual game because it requires a huge time investment, and demands players be active at X time of day to encounter Y wold boss. Furthermore, unlike casual games, Guild Wars 2 has a shitty tutorial that does not properly teach its mechanics. The NPE does a poor job guiding players through abilities and content, and instead chooses to level gate instead of organically guiding the game. But the worst thing of all that makes GW2 NOT a casual game is the huge time and gold sink required to match a more invested player, due to not only the cost of Ascended armor, but the fact they give you exotics with shit stats as Soldier's or Rabid's as story rewards and levle80 boost, which completely misinforms the player, and demands even more of the player's time and gold just to fix it.
---
GW2 is NOT a casual game. It's a game that continuously asks more of your time. It's a game where you will never be equal to other players unless you shell out time and gold. It's a game with time gates everywhere, demanding that the player continuously return instead of letting them enjoy it at their own pace.
---
That is not a casual game.
---
Now, it is true that a player with bad gear can clear the story. That again does not indicate Guild Wars 2 is a casual game. That just means it is a minecart cutscene ride you cannot fail. And it's to the detriment of the level design. The story does not empower casuals who only have a few minutes to play. They do not feel any accomplishment for defeating Kralkatorrik. Story is just a means to an end, where players feel obligated to do it before they can do open world.
---
Here is a handy infographic illustrating the issue in other game genres, and how it relates too GW2: http://i.imgur.com/AW6kK.png
---
&gt;It's not an objective critique of the game - it's an attack on those who prefer the game.
---
People can enjoy their minecart on-rails cutscenes and rewards simulator if they want to. I won't judge them for that.
---
However, I will judge them if they think those same story missions shouldn't have a difficulty scaling. Because hardcore players matter too.
---
The truth of why my comments are being downvoted is because the GW2 community is in a sate where it has become extremely vicious to any criticism of the game. I don't know when specifically this began, but the change in tone started around PoF, maybe mid-LS4. And it's such a shame because GW2 is such a good game with a great combat system that goes underutilized in an open world and storyline where your skill bar does not matter.
---
I didn't suggest you to call them a sweety, so your strawman is not appreciated. I apologize if this is a touchy subject for you and if I have offended you.
---
**TL;DR One good thing about the event is that it can still succeed while the individual can fail it but refusing to spread. That is good game design.**
---
1 silver 50 copper is an acceptable cost, same for a loading screen. 
---
Don't want either, move to someplace that's not overpopulated like crazy *before* the event starts.
---
Shit vaporizing isn't the problem, people being physically incapable to adapt to a strategy that's beyond clumping up and pressing 1 is the problem. Simple solution to the problem: have them deny participation until they learn how to press W until they're somewhere the big-ass blob is not.
---
No, seriously now. That issue is not an issue. You try to enforce zerging on an event that's literally not meant to be zerged, and instead of just moving one of the fuckzillion marked places on the map, you insist to do exactly one of the three that every. single. other. person. is attempting to get to, too. Then 98% if you get nothing because you're stupid and bad and instead of implementing the *slightest* correction to the way you approarch the situation, you bitch on reddit about it.
---
Move, motherfucker. It's not that hard. It's literally the simplest thing in the whole game.
---
Oh only this and Ghostly Hero are titles that I love. Sadly I am stuck at 43 points. Gz, mate!
---
What's Shadowmoon?
---
&gt; do you not see how someone could misconstrue this as being insulting?
---
I said that to you, not to the person in question.
---
I really like to raid in more casual groups and even with new raiders but there are those new raiders who refuse to learn or listen to anything said and it's just like, why are you raiding if you don't want to succeed
---
totally unrelated, what is your character wearing? I have no human female in medium armor, so I'm not familiar with the skins.
---
holy shit @\_@
---
late response but that kinda frustrates me but whatever. I guess survival skills exists now. I guess i need to rethink what to do rune wise for ranger.
---
Put them on warning; if they don't reply after that, kick them and move on. You made the best attempts and they weren't listening. I'm not saying you have to keep someone on no matter what, of course. That's unrealistic (and this is coming from someone who would make stupid mistakes like not dodging mechanics or falling off platforms way more than most) and hurts your experience. Probably best for everyone so that they can cool off at that point. Just wanted to point out that using your 'why statement' can be taken as making the person an enemy instead of the challenge they're trying to overcome (so long as they're taking suggestions).
---
Wow, that's impressive. And here i was happy being near 5k.
---
Can't wait for new dungeons
---
Might be an option in https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_Bash_Victory_Coffer
---
If not then they should. Ideally each year adds a new skin and the previous years' skins gets added to the coffer ...
---
I have a problem. I can't record myself on my computer (Windows recorder can't find the mic and I don't know how I would add the song to the recording anyway) and I find nothing helpful online. What can I use instead that allows me to record the track being played and my voice at the same time?

WHY
---
Thanks. I feel like the Titles in GW2 don't really have that much meaning, there are too many and they are also not that visible to the player that can see them.
---
I can still remember sitting in the outposts and cities in GW1 and getting whispered and asked what that title was since it was double the length of my characters name. You stood out with those titles because people knew how difficult it was to get them.
---
With the number of titles in GW2 the hard ones really lose their meaning.
---
GW2's Ranger isn't a hunter, it's a nature magic bound/based class. A rifle would be the exact opposite from what the class stands for.
---
A rifle would suck so ... no thanks.
---
Here's a dumb question ..
---
I stated playing a week or so ago. I'm literally still learning mechanics, and learn something new every time I log in (the whole 'different weapons = different skills' still baffles me).
---
Anyways, I see an option to start a guild, but I don't see an option to find/join one. How would I go about this?
---
Ok. I resign. The word "why" hurts people. Note taken.
---
Shadow of a shadow, i have an Awakened look on my Thief so i like the idea of being a Shadow of a former Shadow. :3
---
WoW have a *Hunter* class, no Rangers. That's a significant difference.
---
This community has a "happy rainbow fairy flower" mentality most of the time. When there are no problems, we're a great community where we're all friends, helpful and kind.
---
But the moment someone fucks up, and someone dares point their fingers at them, hell is let loose.
---
They don't even get to discuss if your ideas/suggestions are better or worse, they just get angry at dissent, any kind of dissent. The problem isn't someone making a mistake, the problem is you pointing at it. You're the problem, you're toxic, and you aren't welcomed anymore.
---
I learned this the hard way long ago. Run away from those flocks of sheep like the plague. They're never worth the headache, and you're going to waste hours of your time, and sometimes not even be able to get to the end line.
---

*"I'm rich, you know"*
---
Wanted for a character.
---
If you want to Raid, WvW, sPvP, and T4 fractal. I say choose Guardian.   
---
FB or DH for T4s.
---
1. Heal brand.
---
2. Quick brand. (basically dps that gives quickness and ageis. 
---
3. Dragonhunter unreal dps in both T4s/Raids
---
4. Firebrand WvW since you don't like roaming you can just stick to the zerg and heal/support. 
---
5. heal brand/quick brand/dragonhunter for raids all 3 work.
---
I play literally every class, and do all types of content and recently it occurred to me that Guardian might be the best most versatile class for all types of content.
---
Thanks for double confirmation.  I was confused myself too when I did mines. Bet one time and in next round I couldn't bet anymore. Initially I thought it was on daily reset. Until I was lazy + didn't clean bag, and saved a stack of zhaitaffy then I realised how it worked.
---
Someone who understands me :')
---
why would it shock me? the area / stampede event is also not fun at all, trying desperately to tag it just stressed people out i bet. so apart from doing it for the achievement points, there's no point going back, other things WAY more fun too. :)
---
I don't get why people think the glider is immersion breaking. Its a world of fantasy, and they are utilizing a magical tech. Especially after all the advancements in Ley-Line tech, who is to say the giant floating rocket chair isn't plausible? ....right?
---
turns out the stampede ain't the mobs.
---
Actual answer:
---
&gt; "One asura is more than is enough to beguile a bookah into doing it for them."
---
ya
---
Yes every class will hopefully be exactly the same in the near future so we will never have to make a different class ever again!!!
---
I never said I wanted to improve myself, so no I don’t need to prove shit to u. I do just fine in raids and fractals and hold my own. Unlike some a*holes, I never get kicked for being toxic or having low dps or poor healing. 
---
The example I made in my post for what happened in the raid was 1 person out of 10 being an a*hole and saying everyone else can’t play including 1 my close friends who has done every single raid multiple times and now just speed clears them. 
---
Otherwise the title of my post and my complaint would be about getting kicked because I think I’m the greatest. But it’s not that.
---
Also FYI I’m not running a banner slave warrior, I find that boring as hell. Of course u can get over 30k without using banner slave. Go on YouTube, hell even look up some videos of warrior builds posted on the subreddit and u will find warrior not running banner slave and dealing around 30k dps. 
---
Still a completely useless performance metric compared to actual dps in fractals or raids. Of course if a person is consistently in the top 3 from 10 ppl in multiple instances they are doing something well. So yes it’s a good metric to go by. Better than stationary, perfected rotation and timed dps.
---
So go back to trolling other subreddits, coping other ppls meta builds and following other ppls rotations and having none of ur own ideas. And of course also being elitist. U are one of those ppl, but whatever makes u happy :)
---
Ay, thats exactly the path I took except for the 24th that I get right after leaving the first big hut.
---
I have a few: 
---
* God Walking Amongst Mere Mortals - was a fun journey back in the day :D (I also like Rift Warden, 
---
* Honors in Applied Jumping - I love SAB. I hate World 2, zone 3 so much. So so so so much. This is my "If I can do this, I can do X" motivational title. 
---
* Hero of Lion's Arch - Shows you've been around for a while. 
---
And then a few fun titles like Good Apple, Killer Queen, Leader of the Yak, and Camp Counselor.
---
Is there something particular your character is doing while "afk"? You do some kind of passive farm and do something to prevent the game from disconnecting you for inactivity?
---
Jokes on you, the only 40k I've achieved in 7 years is the amount of gold in thousands I've thrown on ecto gamble
---
Calling others asshole makes you...?
---
https://reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c5mnep/dragon_bash_pinata_bash_27_score/
---
Pretty much the path i took except for the 24th one i took earlier after leaving the first big hut
---
Since when did I ask for advice? I was asking for opinion. I have given quite specific details. More than necessary for the discussion. Specifically in the raid example 1 out of the 10 ppl was going insane about how shit we all were. When they were in the bottom 2 for dps. Yeah I don’t need ur advice on that. I just wanted o hear ppl’s opinions.
---
17k in raids means a lot. I get that consistently in raids with a good team. Occasionally that dips down to 14k. So did that make any difference to the conversation or give any insight? Nope.
---
Great picture and all, but i would love to see rifle on mesmer one day.
---
Grats!  You also mention you also have every legendary in game. How!?  Any tips on how you've done it all?
---
'Avenger of the Dispossessed' or 'Volunteer' - both were from Season 1. The first just because it sounds cool and the second because it's funny to think the commander started out as a volunteer for the homeless.
---
^(I also like them because they're somewhat exclusive and show I've been playing a while pls no hate)
---
Up'ed for the INSANE character image. Awesome!

Depends how it’s done I guess.

In general, this is the resource you want:

Ticks all my boxes. But like I said - I really recommend experimenting on your own using the first link as a guide!

The only advice is to study the item you want to flip. Use tools like gw2bltc.com to check its history of supply, demand and how fast does it sells. It's the same as flipping an item in the real world.

k thx :)
---
Being the tank meaning you must have a firm knowledge about the mechanic of the fights in order to time your move correctly. One mistake and you may bring the whole raid down with you.
---
I play GW2 for variety. :D……
---
No, I've actually had the Apothecary idea since pretty much elite specializations were released, back in HoT.
---
In fact, I even posted it not once, but twice, on my [Canthan expansion idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/80llpv/guild_wars_2_the_celestial_tournament_canthan/) and on my [27 elite specializations thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8skyup/expansions_3_4_and_5_ideas_for_27_new_elite/).
---
So, whoever made that fake leak, either came up with the same idea, or borrowed it from me. Mind linking said fake leak if you remember it? Just curious.
---
It wouldn't be the first time they borrow my material, the few fake leaks I've seen stole most of their ideas from the forums anyway. Can't say I'm surprised, because I'm pretty much the only person around here who ~~wastes~~ spends time writing expansion ideas and such, but it's kinda annoying to lose the "ownership" to some fakers :I.
---
Joined a Samarog training that struggled with cc. Told one of the Druids he can swap his tiger out for a cc pet if he has a warhorn. I get flamed by his Necro friend. I was only trying to help. :(
---
What parameters should i pay attention to? Bought/sell/demand ?
---
There’s another Reddit post earlier with a gif of it. It’s amazing and huge and I need it. But definitely something that’ll take a bit of group effort farming!
---
“After 7 years I finally completed my personal story, it was such an epic experience.  I’d share what happens but don’t want to give spoilers!!!”
---
And that's why I like this game. xD *I mean Golems*
---
Give Necro a hammer, make him spawn minions like crazy and call him a BodyBuilder :)
---
Yah I only buy black lion keys with in game resources and you can buy ectos with cash for this, by buying gems and then converting them to gold.
---
So no... I dont see your difference.
---
Lord I hope its not Jormag for S5.
---
We don't need a yet another BBEG that corrupts everyone to join its army and we need the asura technology to fix our problems.
---
At least its not human focused though I am sure our team's asura will come up with a technology to fix all our problems.
---
I really wish they'd go with a different idea for a main plot.
---
Probably a Ranger main
---
I think there could be a movement in Fashion Wars too.

It's lovely how the ones talking about empathy often only care about empathy directed at themselves.

&gt;As the old saying goes, “You never truly know your enemy until you’ve defeated them and stolen their profession’s skills.” You can finally put this wisdom into practice in your everyday life during the WvW Core Swap Special Event!
---
&gt;From July 5 to July 12, defeating an enemy player in World vs. World will spawn a glowing orb over their corpse for a short time. Claiming the orb will grant you some knowledge of your enemy’s profession. You’ll retain your own weapon skills and gain access to a special skill that allows you to use the healing, utility, and elite skills of the defeated player’s profession.
---
&gt;The healing, utility, and elite skills you can obtain are the same for every enemy of a given profession, and cooldowns persist when you swap to and from the purloined skill set. For example, when you defeat a thief, you’ll have access to the following skills:
---
&gt;* Withdraw
---
&gt;* Scorpion Wire
---
&gt;* Blinding Powder
---
&gt;* Skale Venom
---
&gt;* Thieves Guild
---
&gt;In addition to these wonderful toys, you’ll also gain double WXP, 25% extra WvW reward track progress, and 50%+ Magic Find in WvW for the duration of the event.
---
&gt;Head over to our [official forums](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/categories/wvw) to discuss the event and prepare for the mayhem!

To piggyback off this u/howmanytizarethere said the player didn’t seem to know what they were doing just auto-attacking with no rotation. A lot of builds have a decent chance of looking like auto attacking with no rotation if you glance at them during the raid. The question is, was the guy failing mechanics? Was his dps lower than yours? Is your dps average for the boss you were on? OP responded saying he didn’t want to give a detailed list of his dps on every boss, okay well take your anecdote as an example and say what your dps and the guy you think was trolling had. Is he an elitist? Maybe, but just based on that interaction idk how you’d make a concrete conclusion, maybe he looked at arc and realized your team did not have satisfactory group dps for the boss and he was better off finding a different group. Is him valuing his time elitist? Maybe he was too dps and didn’t feel like everyone else was pulling their weight. Not enough information on the raid front. Parent comment got fractals and dungeons right though, fractals are notorious for being trolled and you’re not doing dungeons in a typical way if you want to clear every mob.
---
Laughs in [traps](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trap).
---
But they literally have an entire school of skills called Elixirs, one of which has (or had?) completely random effects. Which screams "mad scientist" to me.
---
Alright, now which profession will have the dumpiest utilties to loot? Because I'm playing that profession for the duration of the event. You kill me and "loot" me, enjoy your bad utility spread!
---
Sometimes I feel like we're a dying kind.
---
Some of these fluffy bears were born into cushions, and can't even imagine how the real world works.
---
That's a high Daily Counter
---
For some reason I really want the end of Dragon Bash to be Jormag coming in and destroying Hoelbrek. We’ve destroyed LA enough lol
---
I got so proud the other day when i managed to get to 500AP
---
"Champion of the Gods" was a title for reaching 50/50 Points in the Hall of Monuments. This wasn't or isn't really a big of a deal though because you just needed to earn trophies for the HoM.
---
GWAMM was another story because you needed 30 qualifying title tracks for it to get. This took a lot of work and effort to complete.
---
A home instance pinata would have been adorable
---
Some maps just straight up won't kick you. Guild Halls, for example, you're free to AFK for weeks if you want.
---
&gt; Thieves Guild
---
But every single thief in WvW uses Dagger Storm because it's so insane since the rework.
---
That’s... surprisingly innovative.
---
My experience is that PoF maps seem to have trash rewards compared to HoT, which I think is why they're avoided. People only go to them now for the Skyscale stuff.
---
I mean, it's like they don't even feel shame about their mistakes.
---
When I go down or make a big mistake, the least I do is say "shit sorry" or blame lag (classic excuse). It's important to acknowledge your mistake, to prove you know you did something wrong, even if you don't know exactly what. Then I try to play a bit more safely for a while, just so I don't give my team more problems, but I never, ever pretend like nothing happened.
---
You need the mentality of a 5-year old to believe silence means everything is fine. A minor mistake? Yeah, maybe. But a big fuck up? You think your teammates are blind? You think they're stupid?
---
I've even seen people lie to the faces of their teammates about big screw ups. Everyone saw you fuck it up, and you claim, without an ounce of doubt or shame, that no, you didn't do nothing. Must have been the wind, or a bug, or maybe some other player. You need to be really delusional to think anyone believes your bullshit.
---
Why not? It’s an entirely optional mechanic, just don’t pick up or use those orbs.
---
Pretty good, still a bunch of people in the main cities and you occasionally find people doing missions
---
The game is still tons of fun as it is! You should hop on and start playing again!
---
Yes because GW1 actually has a good story
---
Feels weird man
---
I don't get what it can take away from you. You are not banned to use your own skills...
---
Although they don't necessarily have to design it that way.
---
That explains what Braham got so friendly again with the commander after they met again in LS4E1!
---
Imagine how crazy it would be if skills were random, but still that profession.
---
I was tempted to list them as well but wasn't sure if they fit the "follower" bill. They've been more akin to Almorra, present for the storyline but will disappear once the story goes in a new direction. They're bound to Elona's plot and recovery. Sayida isn't; she's likely to show up again, and I wouldn't be surprised if she becomes our new go-to airship captain (whereas before we hopped on different airships here and there, until PoF where we kept using Kiel's).
---
They tried to with scarlet, and everyone wanted them to get back to the Elder Dragon storyline.
---
Maybe they can make such guild decoations for next year. One for the four dragon champion models (Claw of Jormag, Shatterer, Tequatl, Shadow of the Dragon), and one for Zhaitan...
---
A/R all day with disrupting accuracy and full crit damage with needling shot!
---
Yes, I agree which is why I am a *very* vocal proponent of easy mode raids and proper repeatable CMs / difficult raids.
---
Some people can't, but that means they should be joining training raids and not casual raid groups. The two are very different with the former often not anticipating any kills at all. However if you are constantly failing in a group that looks for others with KP requirements or isn't tagged for training, people will absolutely call mistakes out.
---
"Burn them all" is 30 zhaitaffy
---
If anything, I'd like to see the necro get dual claw-type weapons (a la Diablo II), but not daggers. Not sure how involved it would be to introduce all new weapon mechanics though, so I won't be holding my breath.
---
I would also like to see necros have the ability, in open world, to *turn* mobs, and maybe even control them for short period, or at least have them behave similarly to pet/minion AI.
---
Dragon bash meta achievement.
---
literelly everytime i did stampede theres people complaining not being able to tag and that is not okay. is my point ( and they are probably newer people with no mounts etc who can't catchup )
---
Did you open the crates and geodes?  I've gotten some rares from opening those.
---
Bonus bonus question if you can calculate the carbon footprint WITH the server utilization.
---
I'm guessing Twilight Oasis?
---
I wonder how it will work when you kill a Revenant, do you get a specific legend skills, how will energy consumption work for other classes?
---
potentially a neat gimmick but..
---
given that there's zero synergy with your traits, why would anyone ever choose to use this?  
---
this is a direct downgrade in every single occasion.
---
Personally, anything with Necromancers and guns have to lead to a Demon Hunter specialization for me!
---
Kinda sucks that hitting the deposit all mats will send zhaitaffy to the bank.
---
Tbh they might be bad on thief, but if i understood it right they dont replace your normal skills, so they might be some completely ridiculous combinations.
---

If you don't have the mental ability to cope with basic criticism, you should stay away from pugging competitive multiplayer environments in the first place.

You're only going to create a negative experience, for yourself and for everyone else.

Try tweaking config settings. I got micro stutters every now and then, but they last only less than a second, that's why it's micro stutter

Cross an engineer with a mad scientist elite spec and you can have a dr Frankenstein engi+necro hybrid with monster minions and potions/elixirs of a less accurate nature.

I would like to practice in peace solo lamp, solo kite Qadim1, tanking Dhuum but I feel bad for wasting people's time.

This looks quite better than I would have hoped after the datamine yesterday.
---
I am around wvw rank 3200 and I have no shame to admit that I am a one-trick pony. Since launch, I played a total of 13.5k hours and 12.5k hours of that were spent on my main warrior. Considering that the remaining 1k hours spent on my 8 alts were mostly crafting, trading, storing etc and not regular gameplay, its safe to say that I have next to no knowledge about other classes skills.
---
I can see this event being a fun way to introduce me to other classes skills in my favourite game mode and i can see that being the case for plenty of newer players that only got around playing one class as well.
---
For more skilled players, it will probably be a fun week to find the best class-combo rotations and I expect to get sniped alot.
---
Will it be unbalanced? Sure it will. But in the end, this game mode with its 3 team set up was never meant to be a balanced affair in the first place.
---
For the next event week, I want all pve gizmos and consumables that give you special skills enabled in wvw again.
---
Yes, that is was I thought. Except skills gained aren't random. Could have been fun to roll the dice though.
---
And the optional part, by channeling the orb (which means you don't HAVE TO swap your skills on kill) is a nice touch, since it will most of the time be ignored since, well, it will be fun an hour or so :), so it doesn't destroy wvw for a week for hardcores that don't care about that.
---
Doesn't agent of entropy stop giving AP after a certain amount of times completed? This dude definitely didnt pay to get 40k lol
---
Oops. Corrected it.
---
Maybe it'll be discounted this time... Though it was already discounted back in January...
---
My only question is, why? It's a cool idea on paper but other than that and the increased WXP I could really do without it to be honest.
---
yep, that's what she's saying!  though considering how much they charge for the mount packs, and i have the branded, skeletal, and awakened ones, i wouldn't have bought those packs if i knew that they were going to release other mounts in the future, tbh.
---
Fatebreaker &lt;3
---
Still waiting on that home Noxious Pod...
---
Cool I will try it later for a year never got arcdps cuz didn’t want to mess up gw2hook.
---
Seems powerful to me. I mean, fuck Skale Venom. But everything else? *In addition* to what I have? I won't mind a 1200 range pull with two charges. Or a nice AoE stealth should I need it. I mean, I can work around what I expect to get! Why bring my own stealth, I can instead bring an additional gap closer or something and then just decide on the fly what I use.
---
O wow that is so cool!

Can we just get the invisible tag back please?

Pro players set inventory up in such a way that they can weapon swap real quick ( always know where your weapon will show on screen by placing it in a particular way )
---
Yeaah, I am hoping for Sword next too!
---
Coincidentally alongside your name, I posted my dream spec a while ago, “The Count” - a Dracula inspired spec that gives Necro a sword, more evasive utilities/mobility and counters/cc. 
---
Traits would support their siphoning niche, absorbing life force and health. Shroud would have them levitate, giving them faster in combat movement and shroud skills would mostly be things like ‘mist form to evade’/absorb health/leave shadow clone and go invisible/etc
---
Stronger siphon traits may mesh well with Minions too! I just think since interrupts, blocks, and evades have been largely absent from Necros (at the cost if having a second health bar), having a spec that leaves them with less hp but gives them those tools to both restore their health with well timed counters and CC enemies like A devilish Mesmer would be a cool direction!
---
Plague Doctor would be nice as an Alchemist for Engineer. That type of theme would draw in a ton of people to Engineer since it is an easy archetype to get hype over (I love Engi but many people don’t feel drawn to Holo/Scrapper until they make their 6th character and try it out since they seem completely new) and maybe offer something more mad scientist-y/potion focused for everyone to vibe with!
---
Again, the problem with the 1200 range pull is that its buggy and works less than 1/10 times. Most of the time you just cast splash effectively.
---
It would be cool to have offhand pistol skills drain life and build life force, while main handle pistol skills use life force as like ammunition to power up for greater effects.
---
Gratz, that is crazy but I also am super casual for that time. I just got over 15k recently.
---

5000?
---
The achievement needs 150 points to complete. Each firework consumable gives 9 points so you only need 17 ...
---
i don’t own path of fire 😕 do they go on sale often? i’m looking to buy them
---
Please calm down. I highly doubt any of what you're saying is true with how you're reacting to people using meta builds and optimal rotations.
---
0
---
Yeah and who’s gonna pay for that?
---
I would love to play as a vampire. Your minions could be reskinned to be ghouls serving under you.
---
I got 38 max on gw1... if I ever decided to go back I could have more since I never maxed the z key title since the z keys and chest was brand new when I was quitting
---
(Yep got ldoa, both max lux and kurz, max rank r15 Hero,.... PLUS all the stupid ones they changed to account bound and I got like 6 maxed titles on the same day... truthfully gwaam wasn’t hard to do after nightfall and HM titles was released... after Gwen it was guys with over 40 max... Motoko the crazy old school trade mod from guru comes to mind, guys like that... basically did it all)
---
The 2 I could personally finish are z keys and (potentially) max skills if I would go back and farm hard core holidays... 
---
So I have zero idea about how I got the points in the HoM since I had them all long before they even released gw2 lol. (Quit and never wanted to play gw2 since to me as a gw1 pvp’er at the time I really really felt Anet abandoned me so I didn’t comes to gw2 for years after)
---
Now of course I enjoy gw2 immensely (even the PvP it’s fun!)
---
As far as those days I basically remember walking into the HoM, clicking on statues, and pimping it out since I had tons and tons of minis already (got ghostly hero, polar bear.. full tormented wall to wall and all that junk sitting collecting dust in my HoM like a fool from old days)
---
To enable or disable channels, first press the button to the left of the chat box to show tabs. Every tab has a cog icon to hide or show specific chats. There is no *World chat*, the closest is *Map chat*, which is contained to the map you are in. Try a city or Lion's Arch for a more active map chat.
---
Weird!
---
Oh man grats, I just hit 30k and Im done with this bullshit ;S
---
I would much rather have build templates. This seems like a whole lot of extra work for very little gain. Anet might aswell make build templates at that point. Which you can already get with arcdps, so maybe look into that.
---
Don’t get your hopes up for the balancing nightmare that is secondary classes, just saying.
---
Everything you need to know is here:  
---
http://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW  
---
Necro (Power DPS Scourge), Guardian (Support Firebrand), Warrior (Spellbreaker), Revenant (Power DPS Revenant), Engineer (Support Scrapper) are popular right now in blobs.   
---
If you're roaming, there's a lot more build freedom.
---
Why balance WvW meta when you can just give other profession skills to any player.
---
This might be fun actually, and it makes me happy that Anet is including other game modes in this chain of events and festivals they started recently.
---
Ah yes I see thanks, I thought there was some kind of activities that you could do while afk that I was missing on (like the minigames during some events in GW1).
---
Eh, the story has had more than enough Inquest and Asura for me for awhile. Let's have some Norn shamans storylines.
---
Certain classes have skills that do this (signets for example), poor there are rune sets that may do this.
---
Best as I can remember they show up day one from the vendor for festivals and lw maps. Maybe one is on the way.
---
The Gold Lion Warhorn makes the same sound, so I can imagine that Gold and Onyx weapons do too.
---
I'd say over build on metabattle should have you covered
---
But let us ask you.
---
What did it cost?
---
I don't think the wings are worth it. 250 Zhaitaffy are ~7g and you need 5k. Even if you get them through the event, they are not worth it imo
---
Anet are really good at world building when it comes to collections, lore pages, npc dialogue, etc. But in the main story a lot of that falls flat most of the time and it’s very straightforward as well as omitting details to move the plot along quicker.  For example never mentioning how exactly we got past the bone wall. Or Malyck’s story, or the rest of the Nightmare court during HoT. Or the fact we’re in Thunderhead keep again. 
---
A lot of the time the ambient stuff and collections and the like are supposed to supplement that. I just think it’s frustrating that most of that time it’s all they do, because the main story doesn’t have anything in that regard.
---
I really hope that if we’re going to Cantha or meet the Largos again, or go to Charr Homeland or the Far Shiverpeaks that they’ll actually focus on the cultures and stories of the people there and don’t just ram us through because another big baddie is threatening to kill them all. 
---
Like, I dunno, have the commander participate in a local dance festival during the story or something. Make the world feel more alive in the story.
---
Guild Warrior for me. Lots of great titles in there I think.
---
!Remindme 3 hours
---
i main necro, and i don't want either. i've wanted hammer ever since i ran cliffside fractal for the first time, like 6 years ago
---
Awesome. Now you can have both + the Mount addon!
---
Saver of my life. Been hoping for these! Thanks
---
Let's hope it works for you!
---
Acrobatics Staff Daredevil. You need to know the animations to land any reasonable amount of damage, and some builds are just going to want to avoid that fight.
---
Only one armor type ?
---
Good evening guys!
---
When preparing to craft any legendary, I find myself always worrying about the needed gifts the most, although they are always farmable/purchasable but only 1 piece - of let's say armour - already ruins me money- and material wise. How do you - and I btw do play quite a lot - approach getting all the materials needed for the gifts? Plain gold farming or something else?

Thanks in advance

Tbh half the reason NPCs are smashed in it are because all of them are either mercenaries or soldiers, which take extra damage due to WvW rank abilities.
---
As a solo roamer Tempest, greater lightning elementals make me win 1v1s.
---
"Chosen" is always a favorite from the HoM titles.  Can fit a character in many different ways.
---
But I mostly use "The Blazing Light" since it took me some effort to get and I find it fitting for an Ele (or any class that does burning).
---
I'm a necro main, but can we give pistol to warrior first? Aka Rytlock build.
---
Jacaranda at Xera does make sense though to avoid retaliation.
---
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.
---
All you're doing is encouraging laziness and ineptitude. This is half of the reason why gw2 community is viewed as a bunch of awful players...not even casual, but straight awful; because even casuals can be good players.
---
A daily limit is fine. An increase in the daily limit is what you're probably looking for.
---
You can repeat the *achievement* infinite times, but the AP you receive is capped. There is no infinite achievement-point loophole you could pay into to reach 40k AP.
---
You too.
---
Yeah, I always hoped Dervish would come back, even as like a Rev elite spec you channel, with actual scythes (not even teh edgy scythes are death huehuehue shtick, I just love the flow of movement you can do with a scythe). But the more scythe staff skins the less likely I think we are to ever see actual scythes.
---
Then being in that group isn't worth your time, either. It sucks, but leaving at that point (and creating your own party if need be) doesn't mean you're in the wrong.
---
bro what about the helmet, are you not writing a guide for that for your friend too? imo that shit looks even cooler than the wings.
---
One of the fun things about GW2 is how they occasionally make a weapon something entirely different.
---
- Rifle is _usually_ a single-target, long-range weapon... unless it's in the hands of an Engineer, when it becomes a high-mobility weapon with powerful close-range impact.
---
- Greatsword is normally a melee weapon... unless it's in the hands of a Mesmer, when it becomes a long-range beam weapon that gets stronger the _farther_ you are from your enemy.
---
- Staff is normally a spell-based weapon with a heavy focus on ground-targeted and AoE effects... unless it's in the hands of a Daredevil, when it becomes a mobile melee weapon.
---
A Necro 'rifle' that acts as a plague-based flamethrower? That'd be damn cool.
---
You won one yike.
---
This is honestly the most infuriating thing ever. People always think you're just lying.
---
It's weird aswell because they clearly don't think much of their skill level if they can't notice it.
---
Exactly, you literally can't wait lol
---
Aren't we known for having one of the least toxic communities out there?
---
Just checking, because I've never found anyone to say we are "awful players" for helping others out
---
It is not in the data-mine, so they would need to patch the game for it. Hopefully a dev adds this.
---
Volunteer. Afaik it’s the oldest title in GW2 which you can’t get anymore.
---
The first two images? They're a handy deer. I apologize if it's hard to get a grip on them, but eventually you'll finger it out.
---
The third one? If you're not a raider, that's &gt;!Deimos, the final fight of Wing 4, Bastion of the Penitent. He's the jailor of Saul D'Alessio, founder of the White Mantle back in Guild Wars 1, who was disillusioned of his gods and taken prisoner. He was handed over to Deimos, who spent the last few centuries torturing him, hoping to break his mind and return him to the Krytan people as a pawn and figurehead. He's somehow managed to retain his mind, and you end the wing by fighting alongside Saul while he aids your party, destroying Deimos and finally allowing Saul to die in peace.!&lt;
---
If you _are_ a raider, he's a pretty fun fight for 9 of the 10 raiders, and a complete and unfun snoozefest for one horribly unlucky person.
---
hello, im working towards crafting one of the legendary trinkets, Coalesence is out of question because im not a raider, so the choice falls between Vision or Aurora. I know the effects are the same, i was just wondering wich would would be cheaper/easier to farm for this far into the game
---
Can confirm most of that with small tweaks:
---
* At the time, I was a QA lead who was one of several staff on hand at gamescom to be a "demo driver" for press. We were typically paired: one person to play the game while the other person narrated the action.
---
* Demo drivers were on Ventrilo with comms officers back at ArenaNet who were coordinating hordes of staff to populate the areas we were showing off in the demo and give that full server feel.
---
* Together we coordinated where the demo was heading and when to use console commands to trigger the Shatterer arrival or extra damage to end the event. My part was mostly telling comms officers where we were in the flow and asking the status of dynamic events in the persistent world.
---
* Honestly, it was probably more boring for the people back at ArenaNet, since demo drivers also got to go through character creation, talk with press about professions, equipment, storylines, etc. It was the people at home who were going stir crazy waiting for bursts of action.
---
* I didn't have my guitar at gamescom, so the *original* original was an a capella performance over Vent (ephemeral and lost to time). I recorded the version with the guitar after returning to Seattle for anyone who missed it or wanted to revisit the moment.
---
Other factoids about the song:
---
* Martin Kerstein was actually losing his voice by the third day, as were many of the presenters. There were several instances where people who did demo drivers ended up doing presentations to preserve people's vocal chords.
---
* "We lose Albert every day" is a reference to Albert Liao, a game designer, who would actually disappear for long stretches. He was always on hand when it was work time, but if there was a break, he'd vanish and come back with stories about all the places he'd visited and people he'd met. I think he was determined to milk the most out of his trip to Köln.
---
* "Leave the rabbits alone" was a reference to the single-shot damage contests that the sleep-deprived devs back home were holding, as rabbits were found to be the best targets for high scores. Another boredom alleviating activity was to use a bug from the Shaemoor fire event to duplicate buckets and create long Pac-Man-like trails of buckets everywhere. I considered including that in the song as well, but kept getting stuck on inappropriate rhymes.

Can't you just make a rechargable card for online purchases or buy a prepaid card ?? don't need credit card

This is depressing.

There's a gsync bug with loading screens in gw2. You have to occasionally change focus, or fps drops to 10-15 until you do.

That sounds more like witch doctor.

They're not wrong.

 You have to remember its optional. U can choose which utility to use. So Worst case u do nothing and  always use your normal skills and no harm done to you.

But hey, using  the Thief example maybe dropping a surprise stealth could be fun and save your arse at some point.

I've never gotten an ascended box out of a noxious pod and I did DS daily for more than a year when it launched. The drop rate doesn't seem any higher than getting one from WvW, Teq, or TT. You can get a pre out of the bandit chest or any of the other HoT nodes. There is always a chance to get something. So what if you get an asc box from a node? It's no less effort than opening chests in bitterfrost frontier with a torch, or a chest train in SW. People have gotten them there too.

You're the one throwing punches, and you tag me to show this?

---
And it seems you know the whole community.
---
For whatever reason you think it's alright to go around saying that people who do research for others are actually making the game *more toxic*. That's some really nice acrobatics on your rationality
---
&gt; does the game has rideable mounts?
---
Yes, and unlike in a lot of other MMOs, each mount type is unique and has to be earned
---
You won't be able to get any mounts though without the Path of Fire expansion, and some also require the living world season 4 DLC
---
Mount | Use | How to Obtain
---
-----|---|-------------
---
Raptor | Horizontal movement, can leap forward large distances | Play the first mission of Path of Fire
---
Springer | High jumping power to climb cliffs, and powerful crowd control ability | Finish a heart quest in the Desert Highlands map and buy it
---
Skimmer | Fast movement over water | Finish a heart quest in the Elon Riverlands map and buy it
---
Jackal | Horizontal movement and running up hills, can blink short distances to allow for quick cuts | Finish a heart quest in The Desolation map and buy it
---
Griffon | Fast horizontal aerial movement, used to jump off of cliffs and glide far distances | Finish Path of Fire and complete a large multi-part quest, costs 250 gold
---
Roller Beetle | Extremely high horizontal movement speed | Finish the Living World Season 4 episode 3 story, and complete a multi-part quest
---
Warclaw | World vs World movement and combat; only mount allowed in the World vs World PvP mode | Activate the Warclaw mastery line in World vs. World, and finish a small collection in World vs World
---
Skyscale | Aerial control, allowing you to easily maneuver vertically and glide | Finish the Living World Season 4 episode 6 story, and complete a multi-part quest. This one requires you to have all of season 4 unlocked
---

Yes, transmutation changes the item, if you change the weapon for better one, you need to reapply the skin.
---
However transmutation charges are quite easy to get - you can get them from map completion to 100%, they are guaranteed for finishing capital city maps, and a chance on all other maps (with possibility to get black lion key which is more valuable). 
---
Also, you can get them from login rewards and from playing pvp/wvw.
---
So ideally you can just wait for lvl80 and your possibly more long term exotic equipment, or you can just get more charges by doing map completion/playing those gamemodes.
---
yeah right, dosn't work anymore :(
---
lol, i relate soo hard!!! **😂**  **😂**  **😂**  **😂**
---
This is an excellent example of why you should have at least one "safe" box or bag.  Drop a stack of zhaitaffy in there and you're good for at least 5 race sets if you bet on all the birds in each race.
---
I really love the new title "Ultra Shiny" that came out with the most recent world boss event.
---
It's a bad problem, but the best way to currently avoid this is to go to the devices further off and skip the ones the tag is going too. I use bond of vigor with the sand jackle to zoom zoom past the crowded  devices. I noticed this issue as well. The devices I was going to at first always only had the vet left with barley any HP. Dont follow the horde is the best route to go right now.

The Enigma of Amigara Fault
---
Are you NA or EU? 
---
You want to “farm PvE” but PvE is the broadest content category. Do you have anything you’re interested in learning or doing? Story? Achievements? Masteries? Mounts? Raids? Fractals? 
---
“Getting back into the game” means many different things. If you know what kind of content you’re interested in, then it will be easier to answer you. 
---
All classes are viable. It depends on what roles you want to play, then people can give more solid build advice.
---
Dual professions with a proper QA and testing before hand. This is just Anet screwing with WvW again to see if it sticks.
---
What would be so freaking awesome is if as an opener to season 5...
---
A third of the way into the festival, saltwater spouts start appearing at high ranks in the survival arena as a callback to Taimi's Game.
---
Two thirds of the way into the festival, more of them start appearing at all ranks.
---
Near the end, in high rank survival, DSD holograms start appearing.
---
Rp?
---
What are these weekly black lion key runs you speak of?
---
When was it added? I don’t remember seeing it in GW2...
---
So, I took a look at this survey, and I just want to get some parameters set up.
---
How exactly are we defining "extreme amount" of anything? It seems like a kind of hand-wavey term for what you mean, and I think the wording greatly influences the way that things are answered.
---
For example, extreme amount of competitiveness. If I disagree, does that mean I don't want the game to be competitive? Or does it mean that I only want a mild amount of competitiveness?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz2Fz0OO8ag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz2Fz0OO8ag) that's why
---
I don't understand why they capped every activity when Wintersday, Halloween, and SAB aren't.  It's not like there's anything for us to really gain from grinding out Jorbreakers. And I swear Survival was supposed to give increased rewards
---
All said already. Gw2 F2P is kinda mislabeled since is more like an infinite trial. Usually, F2P model comes supported with a store where you can buy the rest of the game piece by piece: heroes, weapons, skill slots, you name it. **That is NOT the case with Gw2**.
---
Gw2 is **buy to play**, drop $30 for an expansion or $50 for both and the full game is yours for life. If you want to try the game, you can play the core (original) maps for free with restrictions oriented against bots and gold sellers.
---
The reasoning behind this comes with the release of the first expansion, Heart of Thorns. Before that the game was $30, but it didn't make sense to charge $30 for the core game and $30 more for the expansion, specially when you kinda need the core game to make the expansion work. The only logical move was to include core game within expansions, making it by default, free.
---
In any case, you won't feel left out too much. You won't be able to use specializations or participate in raids, but the core game has enough content to keep you busy while you manage to get a hold on a credit card.
---
I was thinking about this since yesterday.
---
You know what to do, anet.
---
u/ViceVX
---
I second Aurora. While the skyscale timegate's been reduced to 3 days minimum, that's if you already have all the materials for the food/snacks. If you buy them straight from the TP, you'd need ~150g (can't remember the exact costs).
---
Whereas for Aurora, once of things you'd need is the wayfarers henge backpack that's timegated at 16 days *minimum*, but **doesn't cost anything in gold**. Instead, you'd need karma + fire blossoms to buy the druidstones from the heart vendors in Draconis Mons.
---
Tldr; Aurora takes longer to get, but cheaper
---
I don't really see what makes a sword more "necromancer-ish" than a pistol.
---
That’s exactly my problem. Thanks.
---
What? There's no gear treadmill at all.
---
If everyone you encounter seems like an asshole, maybe it's not actually them who are.
---
If you want to be competitive in pvp or wvw you need the elite specs to have any sort of security.
---
forgot a word. pretty evident from the rest of the sentence.
---
I forgot a word.
---
I'm in NA. Would gladly tell you about all that, and, when I have the time to play, show you some of these areas of the game. If you wish DM me so we can talk.
---
You forgot the one from the Necro skills. Axe is usually a melee or thrown weapon... unless it's in the hands of a necro in which case it's a weapon used to focus the necro's energies and it becomes a ranged casting weapon.
---
Oops. Fixed.
---
Guys, he's going to say the ñ-word!

Kegmaster. Probably one of the rarest titles in the game. It's rarer than Fractal God.

Be mindful about your class's ways to avoid damage: eg, Thief does a lot on blinding things that are going to hit it or stealthing so it doesn't hit you, Guardian depends on aegis, etc.
---
My guild leader and I (and a few others in our guild) went into the game and just played to attempt to get achievements. We'd stand in a corner and throw a ball back and forth. Sometimes we got lucky and no one else was on the map so we'd be able to take turns scoring goals and winning.

Commited
---
No need to wait really. [They are easy to get if you don't mind farming them. Should take around 8-15 minutes for 1 transmutation charge](https://youtu.be/K0co5VSN4Xk?t=80)
---
customizable skill positions and custom ui placement when
---
but why
---
I played Bunker Scrapper after its rework for the majority of that season while naked.  Totally didn't know about that armor mechanic. Still did okay because Bunker Scrapper was totally busted right after rework. Took a long time for someone in my game to notice and tell me, he thought I was trolling.
---
The Be-All and End-All
---
I' d leave the game instantly
---
Add in Monks and Ritualists as elite specs and I'd insta-buy.
---
Maybe they will be cap too ? Sooner or later. I wish not. I want my wintersday jp over and over again.
---
time to dust off the old hamstorm build
---
some things you cant shoe's
---
I thought that about all the floaty backpieces in the last year. Getting closer and closer to capes.... Things like the auric shoulders and the v. Recent dragon backpiece with its tail, the race scarf... Stick em all together into one texture and there's a cape...
---
Ah, thank you!
---
Thank you :)
---
Ok so first of all, I know this is a question that gets asked about 100 times a day. I've done my research and I'm still indecisive. I guess what I need is some people to really just give me tips that apply to me..
---
What I want to ask is some tips to decide what profession to main. To give you all some information, I'll list some things I like/dislike so you get a better feel of me as a player.
---
I want to preface that I've played my fair share of MMO's (like Silkroad online, CABAL, Dekaron, Flyff, ....) so it's not that I'm too new to the type of game.
---
So in almost every game I played, I liked to do damage. I've never been the 'support only' type of player. However, glass canon classes never really clicked with me, as I like to be 'in the thick of it' and I'm quite prone to taking some damage every now and then. (I know I need to focus on learning dodging etc). As such, I've ruled out Elementalist. I know this class is not suited for my type of playstyle. Some other classes that don't really appeal to me are Mesmer, Engineer and Thief.
---
So far I'm indecisive between Warrior, Guardian, Ranger or Necromancer and I'm leaning more towards Warrior and Necromancer. 
---
I like to do damage, but also be able to sustain. I kind of think that Necromancer reaper is the fit for me, but I'm leveling a Warrior (currently level 62 and I have a lvl 80 Necromancer with the boost).
---
Also in the future, I really want to do fractals and eventually maybe raids. I for sure would also want to have some alts so I'm able to switch to whatever is needed.
---
At the moment I'm not sure what information I can give more, but if you want to know something, please ask!
---
Thanks a lot for reading and replying!
---
Yeah you're pretty much right. But unless someone is trying to get up there in the rankings, I think you can get away with just a core build.
---
Did they? Why did they remove it? I think they should add it back
---
I think firearms need more love in the game in general. Especially rifles.
---
Balance in WvW is a pipe dream, the game mode itself is anti-balance at its core.
---
imagine if you were banned from the subreddit for constant shitposting.
---
A bit far don't you think? It is just a dance move...
---
It's two more than one!
---
New mechanic where you add different death-based ammo to your gun. I'm so down.
---
Whatever happened to Anet reviewing that?
---
I think it's about time they lifted the cap. All my points are going into the ether, so some other player won't feel bad about not catching up. What about rewarding those who've been loyal and played for years?
---
Thank you so very much for the indepth reply. I'll make sure I'll check out everything you've linked.
---
I've also been reading your general guide for the past few days, so I'd also like to thank your for making it. It's not overly complicated but indepth enough and easy to read. It has tought me a lot of things.
---
Also, I'll get some more into warrior and necromancer and try to decide between them or just play them both.
---
PvP rank #3 "Immortal Legend."  
---
Will never be good enough to get it and it just makes me like it more.
---
The balancing would be crazy , IE it would never end up balanced. On the other hand , fuck it , it might be so fun. And it would probably push character slot sales, as well as build template sales and elite spec sales ( if and when they are implemented / monetized ) .
---
It's i-It's i-It's i-It's in the refrigerator
---
Thank you for the reply. 
---
I already tought that those two would fit me the best, but I guess I just needed some confirmation from people who've been playing the game for a lot longer.
---
I'll try to get some more info on both professions and probably play both.
---
The dragon wings also flap when you jump which is fun.
---
Your trolling attempts are rather pathetic.
---
Happy to help, let me know if you have any questions and like others have said GW2 is very alt friendly so most people end up with many characters that can fill a range of roles and content.
---
Is this bait?
---
Is there dialogue referencing that last part? Where might it be?
---
What is HBTQA?
---
Thank you for the reply and a quick breakdown of those professions.
---
Reading through the replies, I think I'll focus on both warrior and necromancer first. When I get a bit better at the game, I might make a guardian to have a good dps profession!
---
Ok, ArenaNet, I get it, I should probably use better abilities ;n;
---
But seriously, this seems a tad exploitable through minmaxing. Have a friend on another server let you kill him with the abilities you want, and go crazy assaulting camps, forts, keeps, and even players as long as you don't kill them with your multiclass.
---
Hmm, what is this is ArenaNet's way to test how multiclasses would work out, hmmm.
---
We're considered the least toxic because we're not playing an mmo, you have so many options to play solo or not even communicate with people you do fractals that there's no opportunities to throw shit at one another XD
---
Thanks for the reply. I read before that warrior is indeed not a top dps profession. This however doesn't bother me, as it kind of has the playstyle I like! 
---
I guess I'll play both warrior and necromancer first. After a while, maybe a guardian joins my squad, who knows!
---
Thanks for the reply. As I've said to others, I will focus on both warrior and necromancer and later maybe also a guardian.
---
There is a big difference between tournament level balance, and  enjoyable balance. Break it enough and the community will disapear.
---
Damn, that's a really legit idea, will try to swap to this, instead of bein an outright dick
---
Is there a limit to how much Zhaitaffy you can get from breaking pinatas? Eventually I just stopped getting any, though the pinatas I broke still counted toward the Paper Dragon achievement.
---
Personally I would say warrior roles provide more personal satisfaction than a straight dps class. You're there to provide critical buffs, burst A LOT of cc, and do critical side mechanics in the encounter. You have a greater responsibility than other dps classes and you are more irreplaceable than a dps.
---
Speaking for myself, this is not bringing me back to the game. As an exclusive  WvW/sPvP player it doesnt address any of the reasons I stopped playing. I'm not against  fun new things but knowing time spent on this is time not spent fixing bigger issues is frustrating.
---
I believe Holos and Warriors can do that room too with a little bit of creative skill swapping.
---
Why *should* there be a spec that's only good in one gamemode? 
---
And why should there be one spec totally useless, while the other spec is better in everything? While other classes have their roles spread over all specs.
---
&gt; look at spellbreaker and berzerker.
---
Both are viable in PvE and both can do 30k+ dps. 
---
&gt; why shouldn't there be a spec focused on each gamemode
---
Because that would fck up everyone who have only one expansion. 
---
"Hey wanna do HoT Raids? Oh, you play Revenant... okay sorry, you need PoF to not be useless, bye." - Pretty much this.
---
A person that called a bunch of assholes, assholes?
---
I'm sure there were times where you did argue though.
---
I typed a pretty long comment trying to explain why I feel the raiding community isn't worth supporting and how they're will always some forms of toxicity in all subsets of gaming but with "hardcore" content it's much much worse and it's one of the main things that killed games like "Wildstar", and also how you shouldn't assume to know what types of people I interact with in-game or otherwise but I don't feel like it's worth my time at this point. The Guild Wars 2 reddit community would rather be sweep up in the rollercoaster of bullshit that is fed to them by ArenaNet and put down people that forget to dodge a ring for one day and take a little more time than them to understand something. 
---
I hope you continue to do whatever it is that makes you the exception to the rule.
---
Laugh's in ranger's Commands xD Although they might be good on necro, but i dont remember if the wording of the skills refers to pet or companion.
---
Hello fellow potato. 
---
I have accepted the fact that I probably won't go past 20k if I even ever hit that.
---
Such is the life of humble dirt dwelling tubers like us.
---
Just keep farming your Teq like a good boy kid, maybe Anet will think youre a good boy and give you that shiny drop
---
After almost 7 years I only have like 3k AP lol but we'll I didn't played for 6 years consecutively, my old PC was ass and just now I got the chance to keep playing this game daily I now have 3 lvl 80 characters ( using tomes of knowledge LMAO) 
---
But it's just amazing how this game can keep you playing for so long and not feeling full burned out, or angry as shit like I do when playing league...
---
Congrats on the 40k I'm impressed by people with so much AP I think I have someone with 36k AP in my playlist, and I met him exactly like 6 years ago when I used to play daily doing wb trains or zerging on wvw.
---
For sure your in-game actions can cause real-life effects half-way across the globe through such a game, easily. But most of the time you won't even notice.
---
You could also think of the collection of all these interactions as an action of "the game" on "the rest of the real life". Lots of time certainly is spent playing that could be spent in more productive ways. But then, would it? Or would GW2 just be replaced with something "worth less", maybe watching TV or something? If so, the existence of GW2 improved the world by giving people the chance to *do* something nice to another person, even if only in a game, instead of just passively watching some program on TV or something like that.
---
I really don't like the cap... I don't play enough to reach it... but its counter to all the other festivals. 
---
I want to know why they capped this one.
---
Congrats. Quite a feat.
---
You can buy complete armor sets with gw2 karma though.
---
I want Sword. Because currently, Necro is the only class that cannot use Sword with any spec.
---
The Hellfire Infusion was renamed to Ember Infusion i believe. Either way the first unknown reward is at 45k AP. Won't see what that is until folks hit 42.5k I believe.
---
cant you buy them with paysafe codes ?
---
All those daily and monthly achievements you mention share the same 15k cap.
---
Unhappy Camper.
---
I like being branded as a sad sack in a crowd of gods, drunkards and people kissed by fate.
---
Is there a resource like this but for Unbound Magic?
---
A good, a thief with shadowstep and blink, and another stealth utility.
---
yes i have. i have seen that there is a cap of 10 times only? but its not officially mentioned
---
Clearly the world ends before this date.
---
Where in VB I have been to unlock glider but not sure where to buy
---
I'd be doen for this. I for one have multiple characters whose progress I've halted purely because I miss the old Lions Arch. I mean, the LA map already exists, tweak and replace/remove some NPCs, remove the forge and toss in the teleporter. I for one would even pay gems for that as a guild hall. I miss hanging out in LA. Not a fan of the rebuilt LA. The plot for the guild hall could be a fractal in the mists of a time long ago, before the karka, before the beached whales, and by Ogdens Hammer, what savings it could be! As a veteran player, I think the nostalgia kick would be cool. Or if we really want to be technical, you could splinter off a fracture that allows movement to OLD Lions Arch (gw1 layout), thatd be a cool nostalgia kick. But alas I think pre-scarlet LA guild hall would be more than enough. As the map/boundaries already exist, and only needs some minor tweaking.
---
But we can spam weapon phantasms and use thieves guild! They’ll app be instantly cleaved down by some warrior walking by, but it will be super confusing for .2 seconds!
---
Probably the legendary trinkets and the legendary greatsword, each needs 250 + 77 clovers which needs mystic coins in the toilet.
---
Why making everything so complicated. I mean i can tell you that making a week were we can ONLY use core spec would likely make everybody super happy not having to deal with condis and cc up to your ears for a week, and just enjoy fights.
---
Too bad "Reaper" is taken.
---
Ok? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I definitely agree with this. What I'd Love:
---
Thief: 2H Sword that acts like a Ninja/Samurai. Steal becomes a counter ability that negates/reflects a damaging move... or something.
---
Warrior: Focus dualwield, uses them like Fist Weapons. We need a class that can beat the hell out of things with their fists. F1 Abilities replaced with  a secondary skill bar that gives you more moves to work with based on combos. This one would be much more aggressive and focuses on closing distance. 
---
Mesmer: Dual Pistols, probably very Bayonetta inspired. Most mobile version of mesmer focused on AoE damage within a circle surrounding the player.
---
Elementalist: Not sure what their new weapon would be, but I'D LOVE a Demonology inspired, summon focused specialization. Maybe even working like how Pets work for Rangers, but with an entirely new lineup of things to tame (Imps, Wisps, etc). Maybe Dual Torches?
---
Necromancer: Rifle with a Kit Focus, definitely plague knight inspired. Gasthrower, Vials (like Grenades), improvised traps. Large poison fields, slowing movement. 
---
Revenant: Focus dualwield, same concept but closer to Monk. Abilities are based on stances.  Maybe even mix in a bit of what Weaver did, and let Revenants get a Yin/Yang mix of two spirits - sacrificing the benefits of one for a boosted version of the other.
---
Ranger: 2H Hammer, focused on spirits of nature and druids, but with AoE Slams and charged attacks. Meditations, maybe. Active pet dictates the type of fields you place down when creating an AoE. Maybe you can set your pet to defend an AoE you've laid down, but that might be too much.
---
Engineer: Maybe shield Mainhand, embracing their bunker nickname in PvP but turning them into a literal tank that relies on Break Bars to take serious hits. 
---
Guardian: No clue for them. Maybe Warhorn, focused on much more of a support role.
---
I was curious :o
---
It's a videogame, don't take it too seriously. Maybe put that effort into your job or something
---
At the start you wont have that many of the charges but they are really not that hard to get. You can get them from black lion chests (you will get a few keys from the story so you can open them) You get a few from log in rewards if you have a payed account. You can buy them for gems in the gemstore (and exchange from gold to gems if you don't have the money)
---
You can map the racial cities and get one for each. You can do this on many characters and get for each character. 
---
You can play WvW and PvP and get showered with them from reward tracks or from the chests.
---
There are probably some more ways that i forgot about but this you can start with. 
---
At the beginning i would rather wait until reaching lvl 80 and then transmute when you have got your first exotic set of gear.
---
Uh...
---
Dude, that's not how that works. That's not how any of that works. African Americans still have dark skin, even if they're from communities that haven't had contact with people from Africa for over 150 years. Of which there are *many*, actually; and yes, this includes mixed communities, too. You're also forgetting that there was at least *some* trade between Amnoon and Divinity's Reach, even if it wasn't a *lot* (references to it in the Elonian district of DR), and the occasional refugee group (even if not as many as we got post-Balthazar). Finally, it's not like you couldn't create an Elonian-looking character at character creation; the update just gave *more options* (and better options). If you had a missing sister, you can say you're of Elonian descent, and this makes your sister dark-skinned (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deborah).
---
If you're talking about his outfit, how hard is it to believe exactly that a Tyrian of Elonian descent showed up in the land of his ancestors and decided that he wanted to get a cool new outfit? Or that he might have even inherited it from his great-grandparents or something?
---
Thanks a lot!
---
OOps forgot you also need the itzel mastery to buy that
---
Since you happen to know so much about me, can you tell me how much money I make...or even have?...or an even easier question: what is my job?
---
I've a couple of the fancier ones, but my favorite remains Killer Queen - it is, of course, my favourite Queen song.
---
There are no raids in the core game anyway and there is the only spot in the whole game were you can tank some of the bosses. Anywere else in both core and expac there is nothing to tank what so ever.
---
WOW! Do you have Ultimate Dominator?
---
Well according to gw2efficiency.com, Aurora is still cheaper purely in terms of gold spent.
---
We Necrons now bois!
---
Nice thanks for sharing.
---
Oh hes on a spectrum alright
---
There are players here in reddit who have played the f2p version for nearly a year (i think that is the most i seen) before they bougth the expansion. I know one guy was full ascended gear as well.
---
So i would say you can have a lot of hours added to just play the core which involve dungeons and fractals, PvP and WvW as well. 
---
Will you be equal as those who have the elite specs in PvP and WvW? No you won't. Elite specs mostly beat everything else. But that does not mean that you can not play it you simply need to work harder, be smart and know your limits and you can get somewere.
---
I read your reasons why you can not get the expansions and i understand, sometimes life is a bitch and there is nothing to do aobut it then just play it out and wait for better times. Playing as f2p until that happens is for sure something you can do. Just be aware of that Neverwinter and GW2 is VERY different from eachother and for you to enjoy GW2 you need to look at it as a whole new experience instead of looking for a new Neverwinter game :)
---
If you want to reuse the armorset for PvE you're  fairly limited in your choice of WvW zerg builds.
---
You allways want power based damage due to the insane amount of condi cleanses in the current meta. Spellbreaker can run Berserker Armor just fine. Same goes for Shiro Hammer Backline Herald. Scourge can get away with Berserker armor but you really want Marauders to not die instantly. Firebrand and Scrapper both want Minstrel wich only sees niche use in PvE. Some goes for Ele, backline Staff Ele just isn't that great anymore so you'll most likely end up on some Minstrel Tempest build. Thief, Ranger and Mesmer are for the most part irrelevant for zerging. Guilds often run a single thief for focused damage and 1 Chrono per Squad can be nice for Veil and Grav Well, but it's pretty niche.
---
RemindMe! fourty years
---
Only issue is, to fill these roles you still need 3 to 4 gear sets. Zerker for Dh, Harrier for Healbrand, Minstrel for WvW and some Diviner pieces for regular Quickbrand.
---
ArenaNet is notorious for their distaste for P/P. They've **fucked** P/P thieves for years.
---
As a rule of thumb, selling is more profit than opening. Price will increase after festival is removed so save them if you want more gold
---
If everything is extreme than is nothing ordinary?
---
ExtREmE!1! Game
---
Most of the achievement should be doable with any level, just go inside Hoelbrak.
---
I don't know about the arena, and the stampede can be a little difficult with a low level character.
---
Please don't. Power firebrand is more than sufficient for most cases.
---
We once did a t4 run and noticed lack of might even though we had druid. I noticed that CA abilities did not give anything and asked the guy to run grace of the land instead of lingering light or w/e he had. He went on a tantrum: "don't tell me how to play a game!", "you should be happy for the healing I provide!" and left the group before the endboss. IDK what's wrong with people.
---
I don't remember ever launching TacO as admin, is there a reason for that?
---
Primordial Legend, the one for getting legend in first PvP season.
---
Just had a friend report that first time running it today (so no 100 chest dr) he did the 9 from the meta and did 8 champs so 33 chests total = 16 rares.  so yeah i'd say a 50% nerf
---
Friend just reported in after doing the meta and 8 champs, 33 chests, he only got 16 rares.  50% nerf it seems
---
I wouldn't say you get these in large quantities at all. Relative to most of the other festivals at least.
---
Oh, so you know me!  
---
And every other player in the game!
---
The Mesmers who port in JPs
---
The Necros that ravaged PvP and later got gutted!
---
*every single blob* from WvW!
---
You know A LOT of people, huh.
---
Well, guess I can't really argue with someone so omniscient like you!
---
Xera's breakbar isn't a pass/fail kind of thing. She takes significantly reduced damage while it's active as well as affecting the shard spawn timing. If it doesn't get broken in a reasonable time frame, you'll have a much more difficult time phasing her in time to pass the no-move dps checks.
---
Her breakbar is one of the ones where everyone, dps and healers included, need to stop what they're doing and contribute. It's in the dps' best interest to break it faster, even if it means interrupting their rotation, because they don't do much damage while it's up anyways.
---
Which is why it's only for a week and not forever.
---
Not a clue, but probably a lot less than people who don't take casual videogames so seriously
---
Not really but some ppl reported glitches without it.
---
gw2 probably has the most toxic community I've been part of.
---
downvoted it just for you :)
---
always disliked that about some people's class recommendations. (Or reasons to shut down other ideas just because it doesn't fit the overdone archetypes).
---
the best part about guild wars 2 is that it has some weird shit in it!
---
first of all, why would anyone think a light armour class that creates clones of itself could wield a two-handed sword that it SPINS magically to shoot a BEAM of magic. OR a heavy armor class that flings MORE HAMMERS.
---
Give us pistols for necro, rifles for ele, scepters for thieves!!!
---
The survival thing is really a bummer. Especially that it shares the bosscap per day/account with the normal arena. But in the end it is the most fun part of the event. On later stages bosses can be quite challenging.
---
And SAB is also capped-ish. Sure you will receive smaller rewards for every run but the "major" reward per map/day is also capped. It is just not a hard cap. My guess is the design philosophy has changed since the first implementation of halloween and wintersday. Player counts per day are more important now than seven years ago where gw2 was the new kid at the ball park. Now it is grown up and it has to proof itself through consistent player engagement.
---
Ah yes, because no other CC sources exist in this game.
---
They wouldn't actively discourage expac sales tho.
---
If you're on a US server, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I help a lot of people get back into the game. I take them around, show them some things they can do, give them some tips. There's really too much to type in a single reddit post.
---
You think limiting a three week festival to about 30 minutes of gameplay (excluding the stampede) a day is them proving themself?
---
I opened 2000 (value of 400g) and got back about 250g worth of items. I'd say you get an average value of 25s per coffer. Better to sell unless you want to gamble for the infusion/Gift of Aurene/Teq wep.
---
Well in case of previous event nodes they arrived not weeks later but years. The first two halloween events there was no candy-corn node and the sab thing is also "quite" new. So maybe we will see a node in subsequent years. But it is very unlikely that they late implement more rewards for the festival. Usally they are there since day one.
---

---
Pretty easy to play at a competent level, but the skill ceiling is very high. There's a lot of little stuff to optimise if you care to.
---
With an elite spec yeah the thief
---
They should reset each year, but I agree 300g isn’t worth 25ap to me and you can get the main achievement without doing those 2. Hopefully they’ll drop in price towards the end of Dragon Bash but we’ll see
---
I doubt that. Otherwise we'd get copies of the skills the enemy had and get more data from more varied builds. 
---
But we get a fixed set from each profession.
---
At most they may be testing an elite spect for thieves that allows them to do the same and steal fixed sets of skils from each profession.
---
As a Sylvari who chose the White Stag, I thought for a while that those story quests were where I got that title
---
Holy crap that is amazing!
---
Generally, it's usually a good idea to stick to what you know. Take that lesson into the real world, along with the other lessons I've taught you here. It'll help you.
---
Instead of being the "nicest community"...cause you're not.
---
Wow thank you this is really helpful!
---
