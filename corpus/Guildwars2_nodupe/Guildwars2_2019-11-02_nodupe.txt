Last minutes changes can be difficult to squeeze in but all they had to do was post pretty much this exact same message on Tuesday instead of Friday.
---
---
---
this is the case of reusing assets and nothing else
---
Thank you, but the event timer is not what im looking for.
---
&gt; I've always felt, that if you have to make a rule against something, you have a flawed system and you should fix the system so people don't even want to do that thing in the first place instead of making the rule. 
---

---
Agreed, they should remove the player to player mail system and increase the maximum sell value on the TP.
---
Is anyone actually Anet to change anything?
---
I'm not holding my breath.
---
They should either make a real build template like the one Delta made and actually allow the players to have advantage with it, not like now that they basically removed WvW and PvP builds and placed it there for universal use OR if they dont want to make a real build template function then allow using the Delta build template, because what the Delta one did and what this does is almost like 2 separate things.
---
I mean, even if they leave it like it is now and allow the Delta template worst case scenario people would use BOTH, and some people who didnt used Delta´s templates till now will use the build in one anyway. I see no reason to play this idiot game of "We dont allow anything 3rd party because we have a built-in thing and we also need money"
---
Lets say it out, the in game templates are badly desinged, they dont even work normally, they even deleted some player´s gear and they also break the whole game...
---
And to top it all off, they say they were working on this for 2yrs... I mean, working on what? How to break the servers with an UI update?
---
No wonder that the whole GW2 community is memeing, asking for money for a tool that actually makes players to be afraid of playing the game is really the best idea
---
I have at least 2 grand spent, its crazy how it adds up.
---
But even if you, lets say buy 10k gold with gems, you wont get the item, because its so rare that there is on average 1 drop per month and you arent the only one that want it.
---
Considering the number of times some one has come on here complaining about a supposedly unjustified ban only for it to come out that the OP wasn't telling the whole story and wasn't actually banned for what they claimed, I'm giving this instance like a 90% chance OP isn't telling the whole story.
---
It boils down to probabilities. Most people won't use a VPN and would get caught. Anet for sure also has more data than just IPs (like which windows system/version etc.). If you use two different physical PCs you might get away. But most people would get caught. That's what matters, not the 1% which get away.
---
Afaik is Anet also banning all accounts of botters/RMT traders etc. Apparently are they able to figure this out.
---
Price is an issue but functionality and limits are much bigger issues.
---
I believe in Anet.
---
What are you happy about? I ask only because am curious, tell me so we can be both happy about it
---
Which is why new Vegas is so good, it has actual writers behind it.
---
Is it time to increase template limit to 10 yet? The one "responce" for a legitimate issue I can see them implementing.
---
Ask for a senior GM. Escslate this, it's absolute bullshit.
---
He's got -100 post karma and has a fucking flair on how many whiner's he's "logiced". Holy fuck, how insecure and delusional can you be.
---
One of the developers confirmed on the forums that the riftstalkers are an alien race from the mists, enslaved by Kralk.

&gt; Another thing if anyone from ANet is reading this: Ever since this change, along with the removal of Arc templates my guild has slowly dwindled from having a raid static AND training group AND fractal groups AND a dozen casuals chatting to less than 5 people online on prime time Friday night.
---
Dont you think Anet has better metrics to determine how many players are still raiding than looking at reddit your info about it?
---
I was one of the few people who thought “This sounds fine. It’s not anywhere as good as GW1, but it’ll serve my purposes just fine. I’m not a super raider who needs 13 builds finely tuned to specific bosses.”
---
Then the update hit and I happily started to set up. “Cool, that’s my condi holo build... and my power build... oh! I forgot my WvW heal scrapper. Wait. Shit.” Like come on.
---
For 3 weeks before the actual release we have been writing stuff both here and official forums. All it would take to minimize the damage was a simple message *We have read the community's opinions. The release will go as planned, but except some changes to the system later.*
---
People talk about spaghetti code but forget how quickly ascended gear and fotm was patched in the game. Or the huge HOT changes. If we aren't seeing anywhere near that cadence that means they just have a lot fewer people working on the game, potentially less skilled people too.
---
Haven't had many people able to beat my dps as a weaver, even condi weaver in fractals.
---
Only in good groups usually CMs do they burst fast enough to make DH burst count.
---
AS/400 comes to mind, I was working for a building society that was still using a very heavily modified AS/400 for all ledger actions on savings and mortgage accounts in 2010. And to the best of my knowledge they still use it today. Software from 1988 that requires dwarf fortress levels of arbitrary keyboard shortcuts to perform basic tasks and no UI. And yet this software is responsible for the ledgers for banks! AFAIK even the Bank of England still uses a modified AS/400 system.
---
My old employer had a dedicated team just to keep the system running and it threw hissyfits anytime anyone looked at the code, never mind touching it.
---
There was no contradiction in this case though. But I can't even find the statement I mentioned, all I can say is that I disagree with you, but I cannot back it up. So there's really no point in discussing this any further, you can claim whatever you want, I cannot prove you wrong.
---
&gt; Remember the ban wave a while back? The assurances that they were properly investigated, would not be reversed, and there was no chance of a mistake? It was partially reversed a few months later because I user did actual investigation, found a flaw and had to strong arm his way into someone’s email inbox to get it to happen.
---
This is something completely different. Anet's stance on this was simply "breach the ToS and you get banned". They thought they breached the ToS, so they banned them. Later they found out that they severly fucked up. They didn't breach the ToS, so they unbanned them again. Sure, banning them was a super dumb move in the first place, but their public stance "breach the ToS and you get banned" stayed the same the entire time, there's no contradiction here
---
E A ... NET :D
---
&gt;Doesn't feel like a lot of money when you spend here and there, but it really adds up.
---
  
---
This even has a name, *latte effect*. You make small purchases over time and suddenly you spent loads of money on tiny things with Tony amounts.
---
 I have multiple alternate characters and my main name isn't even this so it was interesting to see them address me with my Greed Emissary alt :)
---
My friend who is a Fallout hardcore lover actually predicted 76 was going to suck the souls of many players... Was kind of weird watching lose all interest the annoucement in a split second and saying "I'm going to play New Vegas, call me if something interesting happen"
---
Well, stuff happen before and after launching.
---
They already released it with the gems, there's no way they'll change the system now to have more free tabs, or even lower the prices. Look at the mount adoption license. When it first released, it was fully RNG only, and there's never been a selectable version of that because of the people who already bought the item in the first place. People spent real money on these template tabs, they can't just change it up one week after release.
---
My conclusion: don't expect anything other than, and I'm hopeful, actual system changes to how the templates work (unlimited tabs?).
---
One of the few mechanic am weaknesses I've noticed when playing my power weaver is the lack of utility. The power weaver does fine dps, but the lack of utility or books means that if it can't do massively more dps or do competitively same dps but easier, you are doing more work for less payoff. This is an age-old argument. The diluting point is that as long as anecdotal examples exist, he weaver will be considered fine. I don't personally think there is something wrong with the weaver overall, but I would not deny Anet from improving the performance capabilities of the weaver.
---
I think a way to fix it would be to let build templates inherit from gear templates. Meaning for each gear template you have you'ld get the amount of build templates PER gear template. Meaning people would be easily able to switch out builds for different gearsets. Give everyone 1 extra free geartemplate and keep the amount of buildtemplates (which are now per gear template)  the same. Which would essentially triple the amount of available builds per character (which brings it back to at least 1 per gamemode. Also make it so that you have to actually SAVVE a template instead of autochanging whenever you swap out something. That would at least for me fix most of the issues.
---
The only thing they could feasibly change without pushing the release date would be the price and their stance on arcdps, and they **did** change both of those, at least somewhat it seems. The princes are slightly lower than what they initially compared them to (I think builds were said to be like bag slot price-wise so 400 gems and equipment templates like bank tabs or something else). They didn't give a full "100% OK" on 3rd party templates but they gave the most feasible thing they could: that they won't ban people for using that stuff outright but you have to take responsibility if you use it and it includes stuff in an update that violates ToS, because they aren't going to do oversight into making sure it works fine.
---
When did I call you a dumbass? There sure is a lot of hypocrisy coming from you.
---
Welcome to the world of corporate America?
---
The context is different but the overall “problem” remains:
---
OP was banned and flagged for taking part in RMT. OP did not take part in RMT and has proof. OP was explicitly told that even with proof, the ban and flag would remain.
---
I mean, one year of FF14 including initial price costs the same as maxing out 6 characters with build templates in GW2, if you are going to argue about value then GW2 templates lose 10 times out of 10.
---
&gt; except as may be specifically authorized by the Service and by ArenaNet or NCsoft
---
Anet has said that Gw2 exchange is fine.  
---
I mean if its just a general rule then trading *period* is fine.  If your friend asks you on discord if he can buy a rune then thats a bannable offense.  If this all falls under Anets idea of RMT, they have a really, *really* dumb definition of RMT.
---
Definitely agree on this. I think they should taper expectations if they already saw that their release won't meet community needs. 
---
I'm glad that they finally addressed some of this stuff, especially how they mentioned that they're working on having actual sPvP builds as templates (with amulets et al.) but they could have saved themselves a lot of outrage if they said this stuff before it was all released.
---
&gt; We are discussing this feedback internally to determine how we can address it.
---
Once you'll be brave enough to do so, it'll be better if you drop the corporate style and talk to your customers, users using everyday English language as human individuals, not the faces of ArenaNet, LLC.
---
Does it work with gw2 hook?
---
You miss the fact that the vast, vast majority of chak infusion infusion trades are not done through the TP at all. People ARE buying them outside the TP on a regular basis. So while it’s true that “the demand for luxury items are elastic” and “less people are buying them at higher prices” that ignores the fact it’s nearly impossible to get a chak infusion through the trading post unless you’re into waiting for literal years. 
---
So since very few are being traded on the TP and the vast, vast majority are being traded outside of it, it would make more sense to raise the cap/make it unlimited to actually get that TP revenue.  Because at the moment it’s a situation of “barely any taxes” from these items just out of the nature of how/where they are traded
---
Honestly this the kind of approach this company needs to apply to all of its game modes given the current state of the game.
---
Fix broken, unfun elements immediately without searching for elegant solutions while you try to push for bigger, more elegant changes in the distant future.
---
I hope we see this approach continue in the next months.
---
I agree with most of your points, though I think some things could be added and disputed 
---
&gt;build storage
---
I do agree on increasing this and not making it cost anything. They really should just remove the cost of builds and storage altogether and they can still charge for equipment because it reduces inventory space. I don't know if "unlimited" works but it should be heaps more than 24. Adding a feature to default to ones your character can actually use on display would be good too.
---
&gt;Equipment tabs
---
As much as I'd like it to be as affordable as you mentioned, that's a pretty insane bargain that I can't see them ever implementing. This stuff clears inventory space and having them unlock account-wide will produce some nasty edge-cases for those players with maxed alts and all sorts of builds on them. 
---
&gt; "Use this build for [PvP|WvW]"
---
I was told they already understood this issue and had plans for something like this. I do think we all need to stress the selection and automatic part of it. 
---
&gt; Apologise for treating your loyal players like shit and trying to triple dip them for cash
---
As callous as this may sound, when "loyalty" is in the form of playing copious hours but spending minimal real money on the game (yay gold --&gt; gem conversion) while making the most demands out of any group of players and being the harshest critics, I can't really blame Anet as a company for not being so sympathetic to those people. In an ideal world where GW2 is a project made by passionate artists and devs and money and bottom line doesn't matter it would be different, but there's a reason why so many game devs focus on the "casuals", because they are easy to please and have jobs so they'll spend money on those sweet microtransactions.
---
what you're seeing is probably the GPU generating more frames than the CPU can handle, thus maxing the CPU load and negatively effecting everything else on the system.
---
The problem is that the video is not proof! I could simply conspire with a friend to do this exact same thing to launder RMT gold. We can't tell if OP knew about it or not, but he took indirectly part in RMT.
---
OP was *not explicitely* told that *even with proof* the ban and flag would remain, OP was only told that ban and flag would remain.
---
&gt;Mike Z absolutely loves playing the game as well as developing it.
---
I don't believe that at all. That's something that he's telling people to give them a false sense that he actually cares about the game being fun. Have you ever seen him in-game or has seen him play personally? Because I haven't.
---
He started as a tester, put in the hard work to climb the company and now he probably just sits back and lets the worker bees take care of everything because there's no way that someone who legitimately plays this game with friends and/or for fun would let a travesty like this ship with all the feedback we gave. It literally got swept under the rug.
---
Only when there's a problem will he show up and be like "Okay guys, I love this game and we're going to make this right!".
---
If that’s the case, a GM will likely crop up to name and shame. But there is a history of innocents getting hit with RMT bans because they happen to be where an item lands. Even through the TP (back in the day).
---
- Store all your keys in your wallet. 
---
- Put armor you don't need on a second character
---
- Delete useless blue siege weapons
---
- Use that infusion or sell it
---
- Sell the halloween food to a merchant or delete it
---
- Unlock your clothing tonics and delete them, they're outfits now
---
- Put more stuff in your bank or offload the festival stuff to a second character
---
It's been like this for a few years. They've shoved the garbage under the rug again and again, until one day it exploded. Now the garbage is splashed over the walls and everyone can see it.
---
They don't have the capacity to solve this, because they didn't have the capacity to realize what they were doing in the first place. There's no going back unless NCSOFT steps in and replaces everyone on positions of power by actual developers who know how the game works.
---
They used to use the name of most played character but the most recent one seems to have switched to most recently created
---
Forcing yourself to like something just to spite someone who doesn't like it? What point is there to be missed? Are you replying to the right thread?
---
The ogre mini is new, or just the classic mini icebrood ogre?
---
Shaman datamined that they have spots for 10. I am not 100% in the know about what that means. Does that mean that they just have the UI/code space to have the tab there without any function? Or are the tabs fully functional behind there? Obviously they could just be placeholders for if/when they fix the issues. OR it could be that they have the functionality but want to test this limited run to see what it does to the servers (which seems like something that was absolutely needed, given the crashes).
---
Shared Inventory slots are people's go-to comparison but I don't remember them ever being mentioned as being limited by technology. Fully prepared to be wrong on this.
---
&gt; Even through the TP (back in the day).
---
Yeah I remember that one! Anet seriously fucked up there. But I haven't heard about anything similar since then.
---
If what OP says is true, this whole thing is a difficult situation for Anet. It could be avoided if they'd just lift that weird TP-limit...
---
ANet died after GW1
---
I felt similarly after getting banned for the null hash last April. The game was still fun to play after the truth about that banwave came out. I still liked it overall. I just had... no interest in playing it anymore. I tried logging in and just didn't feel like doing anything.
---
Too little, too late.
---
🦀🦀$11🦀🦀
---
Getting stuck months ago and now "for what it was this thing again?"
---
[I wonder why OP didn't just do that.](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/72021-Chak-Egg-Sac) Couldn't be the fact that it's worth more than the 10k limit.  Nope.
---
You gonna delete this post too once it gets enough downvoted?
---
That's actually really sad to hear.  There was a point where I would buy stacks of unoppened Wintersday gifts because there was some item or other I was trying to get from them.  Ended up with a bunch of the toy weapon skins that don't sell for anything.  This was months after Wintersday had ended, so I'd just go into Queensdale and gift them to new players running around.
---
well, they could still make the current slots x3 (3-6 for each pvp, pve and wvw) just like this. they can also work on legendary functionality aswell as linking equip+build shortcuts.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
apart from that yea... theyve limited themselves (likely on purpose) by ignoring the feedback for 1 month and releasing first
---
Yes, any chance stuff can be stored in your bank that you don't have immediate use for?
---
It's very simple. Trade was organized in the trading subreddit, and game items were sold/bought/transfered for other game items. You can not like the rules, but it's pretty clear in the CoC right there. It specifically mentions in game items or content.
---
Not so bad, is full with items for ascensions.
---
Im laughing like a maniac, ty.
---
Now let's dig a hole for this dead game.
---
&gt; It's the same thing with fake money.
---
No, it most certainly isn't. If you buy a stolen good then you're entitled to your money back from the person who sold it to you. You certainly don't get sent to jail, and the real money you paid with doesn't get burned.
---
Honestly, this is common sense. How Anet brainwashed you into accepting their shit is beyond me.
---
People are bitching because for years they’ve really missed the mark on the features they wanted to put in. We bitch because we care for this game and we want it to succeed.
---
Imo the bigger problem is that there are items that are worth more than 10k. Why does this infusion have to be so damn rare that ten thousand gold are not enough? The content you have to do to obtain it is piss easy. Attack the mama chak 2 times and prey to RNGesus. That's not prestige if you ask me.
---
Releasing a teaser earlier than they would is content? K then.
---
This doesn't really negate my point. The new guy is just good at spotting the actual pain points players talk about without getting bogged down by stupid complaints or bad suggestions for real issues. Balance is the most notorious issue that brings out really dumb feedback so it needs somebody who can mine for the good stuff.
---
If it is already account bound otherwise it can be sold.
---
In my experience, it just straight up crashes on boot-up a couple of times before it gets through. Once ingame though it stays stable nowadays for me
---
i wonder which skill on war gona be nerf to the ground next.
---
RIP balance stance,berserker stance,last stand,MMR,endure pain,full counter,rampage. I cant wait for next pick from random silver pleb to point out =)
---
&gt; absorb the hate I'm due
---
Why would you get hate? It's true and I think it's close to common knowledge at this point.
---
You say that as if it's a terrible thing. If you're able to pay the bills and you're having fun with the game, is it really that terrible?
---
The crazy thing is, on the original feedback that was given  a few weeks back, one of the biggest questions asked was, what will the price be, then this post was put out a few days later
---
 [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/90719/about-guild-wars-2-templates](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/90719/about-guild-wars-2-templates) 
---
It completely ignored all questions about pricing, 
---
I believe they knew all along what the price point would be, but kept it quiet to see if the hype would outweigh the pricing, turns out they got it wrong, very very wrong.  
---
When it comes to feedback from anet, they cherry pick the parts they want to see, and ignore the rest, its been this way for years, it will be interesting to see what they come back with this time.
---
&gt; People talk about spaghetti code but forget how quickly ascended gear and fotm was patched in the game.
---
Weren't those planned from before launch though?
---
$900 spent here in only a few months. Good thing I noticed I have a problem and stopped. Like hell I’m going to spend even more on basic game features that used to be free.
---
Open up a search engine and type gw2wiki -itemname, that will tell you if items are needed for recipes or safe to delete or mystic forge or salvage or sell to a vendor or sell on the tp etc.
---
I mean, if you take the strict interpretation, buying and selling items through the trading post is breaking the coc. 
---
It's fairly obvious that that's not the case though, and that it's referring to RMT.
---
nothing, first time ever seeing someone roleplay in guild wars 2
---
They already put someone in to replace MO, and we are yet to hear from that person, and what there direction for the game will be, its to the point at Anet now where they are just afraid to undo things, as soon as that template disaster unraveled, they should have pulled it, or instantly stopped people buying the upgrades, hell on the first page of the feedback
---
 [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/91126/official-feedback-thread-about-build-and-equipment-templates](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/91126/official-feedback-thread-about-build-and-equipment-templates) 
---
Someone pointed out that in the patch notes it said,  **For more information about Build Templates, please read through our helpful guide and watch the related tutorial videos.** and  Stephane Lo Presti replied, good catch they arent ready yet, we arent releasing them until later, 
---
That right there shows Anet pushed this patch early, too early, almost like it was unfinished, and not ready for launch, but for some reason they went ahead anyway........
---
[This one](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/730479#Comment_730479)
---
Though they only answered after [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9sxn5y/support_replied_to_200g_stranger_who_tried_to_ban/) by someone who got banned by accepting   donations for organizing hp trains got 4K upvotes and shit hit the fan.
---
Ill take a look cuz i already got support necro and fb i use was hoping the dps of the weaver was needed in pve lol
---
&gt;A new engine COULD make things orderly enough 
---
you make it sound like that would be an easy/achievable task. But doing that would essentially mean developing gw3.
---
A bag slot is 400 gems and thats 20 slots. A gear template is 17-19 slots depending on your class with the added benefit of it being able to swap between them with a single click on the mouse or use of a key bind. For 500 gems I would call that justified even when I dont like it because im a cheap bastard.
---
Found it, Thank you.
---
There are a variety of mounts now and tons of content that is still actively played! Now’s a great time to come back!
---
[removed]
---
It was indeed, i was on about an hour after it went live, and it wasnt working, the NPC has been removed now i believe, this event and the last one have been bugged now.
---
At this point dude your just repeating yourself.
---
Honestly there ain't much they can do. Maybe they will make the prices smaller or something but that ain't fixing the core issues with the system. The lack of expected functionality and few slots available will likely not be solved and those are the critical points.
---
Balance changes would have excited players maybe a year or two ago, but with ever declining populations (just check out NA WvW server populations compared to last year, you'll see...) it just isn't enough...
---
So many players have said "yeah I'll be back for alliances" that now balance patches don't mean much because friends and guilds aren't playing anymore. What's there to be excited about balancing Scourge properly for organised combat when there's only a few guilds and veterans that even know the intricacies of the game mode and can stomp everyone regardless of what the state of balance is?
---
"addressing the feedback" is shorthand for "making a post where they explain why they had to do this and nothing is changing".
---
anet (and most MMO developers in general over the years idk why) **never** understand when they're wrong. the very best you can hope for is for them to "explain their vision" with a thinly veiled implication that it's you're fault for not getting it.
---
Ah yes, the good old "Hey guys, look at me having fun!! Y'all suck!" post.
---
*Rolls eyes*
---
Please donate people. I want episode 1 teaser so badly :P
---
I honestly feel bad for the devs. They obviously put work into this release and were likely hyped, but the response from the community probably made their blood run cold. I mean I am personally peeved with anet but I still do feel bad for them.
---
i didnt say you shouldnt spend money on the game if you enjoy it. but you **should** keep track of your money. knowing where your money is going is better than being oblivious.
---
Looks like a mask for [Reyes' Ghost Rider](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ghost-rider-reyes/4005-94992/)
---
They didn't ignored regarding Skyscale though. Lets see how things will turn out.
---
I mean, they likely shipped them hoping it wouldn't be a big deal but then it was so now this is damage control.
---
Anet never improve shit yet people still buy it that's the truest shit ahahahahaha
---
Are these two different runs on the 2nd and 3rd, or just one run on the 2nd with a mention that it’s the 3rd in Oceania?

There's robust community both in NA and EU. I'm not sure how it is in EU but NA roleplayers tend to congregate together in Divinity's Reach, sometimes we branch out to other locations but always getting trolled for doing so is a risk.

What's the thing to the left of Princess?
---
Too much traffic atm, someone just donated like 3k to CMCs stream, at 25k they're all shaving their heads! LOL
---
Hell, i backed away from the game because of the gem store. I couldn't stop wasting money on it so i forced myself to leave the game for a long time.
---
I think that at this moment where there are people who have already spent their money on this, the only viable solution is to give away 2 slots for gear and traits. And in this way have 4 slots per char free.
---
Then they will also have to correct the problems that exist. Also if they listen to the community they should add a load and save option for templates.
---
What post did I delete?
---
I understand that it's lousy for the more serious players. I think big problem is that A/Net didn't add an "unlimited" option. It's sort of this situation where people either need a few (casuals) or a lot (raiders). A/Net didn't want to make it too cheap because they would lose out from the casuals (they lose extra char sales) but because of that, they priced the more serious people out of the market. That's why a "permanent/unlimited" option would have been good. They could even make it something high like 5000 gems. That way, the casuals wouldn't go for it because it would be cheaper to buy what they want when they need it but the serious people could get in without breaking the bank. Hell, I would probably buy that even though I am unlikely to use it. I am not buying any templates now and don't plan on buying them because I don't need them.
---
Anet couldn't give two fucks about how "alive" the WvW game is because it monetizes poorly.
---
Sounds like you'd have to adjust a few more settings. It shouldn't crash if it's tuned to your system, but it's very easy to make it gobble up all the RAM/VRAM you have and crash out.
---
GW2 Arenanet has not, never will, and quite possibly will not even consider an apology of any kind. They don’t admit fault either, it would take a decent human being admitting to their mistakes to be in one of these oh so holy positions of power, and Anet has no decent people in those positions, or the one or two people they do have are drowned out by such massive amount of scum that they stand no chance. I would be floored if they ever did apologize for anything or admit fault, it just hasn’t happened since GW2 was released. It did happen in GW1 at times, but not here.
---
It will also suck for players with multiple accounts. Sending stuff between accounts will get expensive. 
---
I don't regularly send stuff between my accounts, so your proposal to tax mail is fine with me. Although I'd be interested to hear opinions from heavy mail users.
---
The trading post will not let you pay more than 10,000 gold for an item.  The chak egg sac is worth more than 10,000 gold, so it is impossible for OP to buy it on the trading post.  
---
Now that you are informed, please edit your post so that we can stop speeding false information.
---
GW2 Anet company culture is to not treat us as customers, but numbers, we as the customer never have any idea of what we are talking about we just need to funnel money to them blindly and without question. For clarity, that last bit is sarcasm.
---
Colourblind...headache. I did it once.
---
How is this different from having to use stacks of ecto as currency in GW1?
---
You need to buy an expansion to use masteries and that includes [Fractal Attunement](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Central_Tyria_mastery_tracks)
---
So if you read that paragraph carefully, one question you might ask is, is the trading post against the rules?  Obviously the trading post allows you to buy, sell, transfer and auction.  
---
And I think the answer to that is the statement, 'except as may be specifically authorized by the Service'. Note, the Service, is defined in the user agreement as ,'Any online service provided by ArenaNet for the Game.'
---
Well OP utilized the services provided by Anet.  The mail system is part of that service.
---
anet has literally never admitted they were wrong about anything ever.
---
You say it's not the problem, but it sounds like that's the problem you're complaining about.
---
There could be ways that ANet could officially link accounts. I mean, they can track where you are logging in from and that sort of thing for authorization purposes, right? So if you're logging into multiple accounts from the same IP, they should be able to tell that. Then you could officially link those accounts into an account block, and they could allow free trading between them. I'm sure there would be some ways that fraudsters could engage in some minor fraud this way, but probably not on a scale anyone should be worried about.
---
It's a shame because the average dev at that company is not at fault here, it just seems to be a few in higher up positions, or perhaps even ncsoft themselves. This backlash is caused by years of disdain towards a company that has on multiple occasions left its players in the dark as trust gets lower and lower over time. 
---
Creates a situation where the deck is stacked against them for anything that isn't the next chapter in the story, as all the positivity and hype have long since melted away. By the time non story content drops, its starting from a negative and *then* it is critiqued, instead of starting from a positive or neutral stance.
---
&gt;There is nothing in the game that is worth more than the TP caps.
---
Actually chak eggs are worth a lot more than that
---
Nothing insecure. Just mocking.
---
It's not like GW2 is the only game out there to fall victim to the idea of marketing running things into the ground. It's gaming in general. 
---

I stopped playing a couple years ago when I simply could not finish maps to even finish the last mount. I really do miss the game but not willing try again.
---
with regards to the price and how they may have lowered it, i would not be surprised if they originally announced it to be a higher price than they would find acceptable so that they could then lower it and get some goodwill from players while still getting the amount they wanted in the end. it's a tactic used in bargaining, ask for a lower price than you are willing to pay and when they meet you in the middle, you accept because that was what you were comfortable paying in the first place, it is also a thing in some shops; raise the price of an item for a few weeks and then lower it to the original price and pretend like it's on sale.
---
iirc mike Z has actually been running the game for a few years and not MO, could be mistaken but i know mike Z was in some high position for a while.
---
people who waste their money on this crap can only blame themselves in the hypothetical situation where anet gives out more free slots. a fool and his money are soon parted.
---
No. They are worth nothing. People demand a certain amount for them, and people are willing to pay a certain amount for them, that does not mean they are worth it. All that indicates is that the supply rate for them is currently too low, as is the case on all items that have a cost of more than a few hundred gold.
---
All respect and admiration the way they go about these issues. We all hope they can get this issue situated. This company has been so good to us players, lets end positively. Allow them proper feed back. Info that can be used for the future and gameings.
---
&gt; Your assessment of their value may be different but it is clear that the economy of the game has fixed their value far higher. You do not get to decide what anything is worth to anyone except yourself. If you don’t think it is worth anything, you don’t buy it.
---
And if you think it's worth more than the TP allows, don't sell it. 
---
Just because you value it higher than that, and someone else does, doesn't mean that you deserve to get that much for it, or that ANet should enable you to make such a transaction.
---
# per character!
---
In other words, initial revenues aren't that great.
---
last paragraph in this post (excluding the one about the links) is waiting for your attention.
---
I really like this picture. It has a nice mood.
---
&gt; but it seems unsual that they got feedback from the community prior to the update but changed absolutely nothing. 
---
No, that seems very usual.
---
Don't forget at $75k we unlock a tonic. Anet really like their cats.
---
They reached 50k much earlier than last year I hope they can beat last years goal.
---

How do you check how much money you've spent on it?
---
I mean they add in cosmetic stuff like mount skins, shared inventory slots, and other things of that nature.  It's actually long overdue for them to add in new account upgrades.. yes its triple dipping, but honestly you don't even need to buy the shared build storage since you have 3rd party programs or hell even just a text document that is good enough.
---
You're an idiot.
---
i think theres a bug where once you minimize the main build window with the arrow icon, it won't maximum back again.
---
It does not.
---
&gt; How it will work with ArcDPS/gw2hook/ReShade/GW2Radial/Taco?
---
&gt; It should work fine with ArcDPS/GW2Radial/ReShade/Taco by now, but not gw2hook.
---
That's a horrible example. A much better one would be if you went to go buy a bike, but the next day the police showed up at your place and told you the bike was stolen.
---
1) You don't get charged with any crime.
---
2) The police give you all the info of the guy that you bought the bike from, and he gives you back your money. If he doesn't have the money, you sue him and the courts garnish his wages until he pays you back.
---
At no point would any sensible legal system charge you with committing a crime because you unknowingly bought stolen goods.
---
Its the other way round..
---
What you can buy today for 5k, would cost 10k then aka effectively being the other way round.
---
Something unique, I guess. GW2 has a very utilitarian reward system in that everything converts to gold, and that can be spent on almost anything you want. It sounds great in theory, but that means any activity is interchangeable for any other so long as it drops loot. 
---
I could go on an interesting adventure to complete a cool collection/achievement, or I could just farm SW/Istan/Dragonfall/Mastercard/Visa. The former would probably be more fun, but the latter is more efficient and braindead. 
---
The best rewards I've gotten in this game have been the few unique ones available for completing achievements like Elegy armor or some of the gen 2 legendaries. It's kinda like in Classic when you get named armor from a dungeon. It's not necessarily better than other gear, but it's special because you got it the only way it can be acquired.
---
Oh look that exact scenario where a player thinks an otherwise legit transaction.. turns out not to be. Hmm. Its almost as if these things were not wild scenarios and actually things that happen.
---
Thats definetly how it does not work. It means that every item will be twice as expensive when inflation devalues money by 100%.
---
Fair enough, my bad. I don't actually use the thing.
---
And how would someone go about getting the chak infusion exactly then? Nobody sells it on the TP because they understand how horribly broken that piece of shit is. The drop rate is insanely low because ANet doesn't know the first thing about how to balance an in-game economy. And now someone gets their shit stolen from ANet for using the in-game trade system? Beyond unacceptable.
---
No worries. Wasn't faulting you. You provided the link so that's the best answer anyways.
---
I also did read skimmer first before realizing it said skinner and was wondering all these wild thoughts about a skeleton skimmer skin.
---
&gt; 10k limit is perfectly fine, nothing should cost more than 10k
---
THIS SO MUCH!!. Anyone who thinks the cap should be raised really doesn't understand the game. Its all about cosmetics and if some are that expensive, its a failure on Anets part. Stuff can be rare, but when you can do Chak Gerant every day for years and never see the infusion, that is a huge problem.
---
My favorite was when he followed it up by actually saying "Purity of Purpose"
---
Doesn't matter what it exactly means, they do have technical abilities to increase the cap to 10 and planned for it, yet gave us only 6.
---
Which is the guy's point. Obviously unionize is the wrong word. A class action lawsuit would be closer to what's needed. But I agree with you, there are basically no laws on the books that handle this kind of situation. Someone needs to bring this type of case to a courtroom to try and start some precedence. If it gets enough attention maybe a bill could be drafted to help codify individual's rights when it comes to digital goods. It's basically the wild wild west right now with how things are. Companies can do just about anything they want with zero recourse.
---
Basically, read the OP and then use your imagination.
---
The main point of this system was that we shouldn't need a ton of different toons. If the system was made properly you could have one of every profession and use templates instead of swapping toons all the time.
---
I too have several decked out characters of the same profession and I was heavily looking forward to delete a few of them after sending gear to my main of that profession. But no, they just created an even worse system than what we already had that didn't change anything. And if you own legendary gear and want to use that for different modes and builds - they just killed that as well.
---
"Big plans"... Everything is relative.
---
You're completely missing the entire idea. 
---
2019 5k = 5k -&gt; 2 years later -&gt; 2021 10k = same as 5k in 2019. That is literally called inflation.
---
Back in 1950, bottle of coca cola costed 6 cents, and now it costs around 2 dollars. 
---
SAME PRODUCT, MORE MONEY = INFLATION.
---
Lol'd at "karkatorrik"
---
Same old. Lot of promises and nothing is discussed.
---

---
Use this site. Give it your API (you can get it from Anet official website  https://account.arena.net/applications )
---
It will show what can be done with what items..
---
I don't have incredible self control, I'm just cheap.  That said, I throw money to support the game for storage, bag, character slots, one set of infinite tools, the deluxe expansions, occasionally a few other things, but definitely averaging well under $15/mo.
---
&gt; Check back in 2 years when the value of gold is half and 10k then will be worth what 5k is now.
---
&gt; If 10K becomes worth 5K, that would be better than if it remains at 10K. It means more players would be able to afford the things they want to afford.
---
It looks like that's EXACTLY what's being discussed.
---
I still got the mail with my main's name, so it doesn't seem to be that either.
---
Im curious to, how do you check
---
Id think efficiency but that will also include alot of things, like Lucky blc drops, gels to gold, dont knownif they count like Merchant expresses and What not.
---
So i woudnt know how to find out. How dis you do it?
---
We have to use it. If I go from PvE to PvP I have to change the build manually. Before I didn't need to do that. That's a huge setback for me.
---
Or it's not about them not understanding they're wrong, but rather they know exactly what they're doing. It's the old question of incompetence vs malice - what do you assume? That they actually thought their implementation and monetization of templates is good and fair and is what players wanted, and that they're just this bad at reading the situation, or that they know it's bad and scummy but don't care because the head honchos only justify the existence of build templates and the dev time devoted to them with the quick buck they can make off it?
---
The old adage says to never assume malice when you can just assume incompetence. But sadly the last decade's worth of evidence of business practices in the gaming industry points to these companies knowing exactly what they're doing. More often than not, it really is as cynical as it appears, right down to companies having positions for "monetization experts" and presentations about the psychology of buying MTX and how to exploit it being leaked. The adage may well apply to people but not to corporations.
---
I'm killing myself with drugs and spending my life playing video games. Any self control is incredible as far as I'm concerned.
---
Oh, wow! How many clouds are there?
---
&gt;hell even legendarys are being sold black market too.
---
This isn't because of the cap, it's to avoid the 15% tax. Honestly raising the cap wouldn't change that. 15% of 20k is twice more than 15% of 10k. Why would you willingly let go of 3k+ gold on a single transaction?
---
The problem with people like you is that you insult people, even if they agree with you, just because you're sensitive and you hate the very idea of someone being okay with what Anet is doing.
---
Fuck off.
---
You're the only one talking about deflation. Everyone else here is talking about how inflation would create a further incentive for anet to increase the TP cap on rare items. The 10k chak infusion with inflation being discussed would be worth 20k. Your counterpoint is that the opposite would be more beneficial to the economy. Unfortunately, deflation doesn't happen without a massive increase of supply.
---
It's either increase the level of rare rewards or increase the TP cap.
---
&gt;data storage
---
If they save the build templates on their servers as anything but a string of text they should not call themself developers... They can save several millions of build templates without having any notable impact on storage or performance - unless their servers consist of toasters.
---
Thinking... thinking.... thinking...
---
"We have decided to provide one additional template expansion to those who had game before roll out of this feature".
---
I mean we already had similar "community is very upset with monetary aspect" -- when expansion was announced and base version initially didn't even include extra slot to create the revenant character.
---
So I bet we'll get a vague "feedback will be taken into account in the future" and "fiiiine, here's one more free template slot, now shut up and buy 3 more for your Firebrand before we nerf it into the ground and you'll switch to next class and re-buy all the slots there" :(
---
We are not talking about deflation.
---
" Check back in 2 years when the value of gold is half and 10k then will be worth what 5k is now "
---
in 2 years value of gold is half. That is INFLATION.
---
So in other words.. you take a risk at who you trade with.. middle man or not.
---
Yeah, never use bootleg exchanges. Just buy and sell things on the TP and you'll be fine.
---
I'm not saying that it's fair, i'm just saying that anet told they would act this way.
---
Not sure why you are getting downvoted but comparing the monetisation models addresses the underlying issue perfectly. The buy-to-play model with micros pushes devs into decisions like monetising build templates. In a subscription base model you get these features "for free". The steady cash flow enables them to put more of the nice stuff obtainable ingame rather than the gem store. I came to a point where I think that a sub is def not the worst monetisation model.
---
I've played almost 11k hours, since around launch and I think I've spend a grand total of 100 euros in this game and that includes buying both of the expansions. Value!
---
Yeah, you should probably stick to the TP.
---
Just because nobody is listing the item on the TP for 10K doesn't mean that they couldn't. That's no excuse for using illicit trading methods. 
---
Nothing it worth more than the 10K limit. There's a 10K limit on what things can be worth. It's set at 10K.
---
"Yeah officer, he said it fell off the back of a truck, why should I take any blame for his theft?"
---
https://i.imgur.com/XYaIzWx.jpg
---
You're really just fine, so long as you aren't trading for things outside the TP.
---
Oh, you meant "Anet is currently determining on how to change nothing and handle the whole thing with PR lies"?
---
At this point they can't change anything because bending to customer demands would be percieved as negotiating with terrorists, potentially encouraging more us to complain more in the future.
---
All they need to do is increase supply so that those items fall below the maximum price on the TP.
---
And if that fails, YOU need to be willing to walk away.
---
Because without that, all of this is just fanboy bullshit.
---
Now i understand my drop in account value.
---
In any case it was to be expected. A new feature should take some time to be placed on the api.
---
Did you try removing arc and then redownload it?
---
&gt;Yes but why should my account be flagged for something i dident do?
---
It was flagged for something you *did* do. You *did* trade in an item that originated from an RMT. You did that. You did the wrong thing. If you wanted to avoid that, you could have done so by not trading in items off the TP.
---
WTF is this post.
---
People are stupid.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dq8rw0/build_templates_crash_my_game_over_and_over_help
---
Yeah, this is the pvp balance thread though, there was another one for wvw.
---
But adding more slots without "fixing" the actual features wont do anything. If people don't buy current 6 slots, they wont get even those extra 4.
---
Yes, and what is your point? The wider rules for the sub are that witch hunting isn't allowed and neither is attacking devs. The post explicitly broke the latter part and I was mentioning the wider context.
---
And then it works 10 times worse thenthe dll ever did.
---
When the changes were made to choosing stats on items, they took most of our suggestions. I'd wager they'll do more than just that.
---
You are welcome to agree with them as much as you wish but the post added nothing to the discussion and was just a direct attack on a dev, something that is against the rules of this sub.
---
yes Arc is actual youmean the dll ? yes is do the errror exits since the windowupdate of 12. october.
---
i have removs the update and arcs works fine the a view days later i upadetet window again and chrash with these error message.
---
sorry for bad english im  german
---
I'm at the opposite end. I've played so much and spent so little. I wanted to support the game but not through microtransactions and quality of life. If you support those, you only encourage them to do more.
---
This is the real reason we're not getting more expansions. They make more money by selling us the game piecemeal.
---
I see less evil in random  scammer now and then, as opposed to organized artificiality market.  While TP takes  more gold , it also removed gold from game and  lowers the inflation rate. What gw2e does is supports few rich to get even more , not removing  gold from game, and making them able to manipulate price of specific items like infusions or MCs.
---
Huh. Actually took two hours for the "but PenisPolonaise17 runs much smoother on my computer than GuildWars2 so the Lead Engine Programmer has no idea what he's talking about" guy to show up. Usually takes like five minutes, tops. Weird.
---
yes, it only matters if they fix everything.
---
Looks like we're still going into a wall
---
I doubt that they are interpreting too much into sales figures right now and will wait with that until at least the weekend is over.
---
Demographically, the players logging in right after the patches and during the weekdays are a much different crowd than the ones logging in over the weekend. So personally, I never expected them to make any significant changes, be it to pricing (which theoretically is easily done) or the way templates work (which most likely requires a lot more work and for most problems they havent found a fix yet) until at least a week after release.
---
sorry to inform you that i had this opinion ever since i first saw the revised UI. stuff like the searchbar to me have always been band-aid fixes that should have been there in the first place. and that's just functionality. the UI itself is heavily flawed beginning with where it attempts to draw your attention.
---
frankly i find it quite telling that you ignore the imo most important part of my comment: the headline feature of the patch that introduced that UI *still isn't fixed* and it's been *three months*
---
They should include a graphics option that toggles the display of infusions.  That"ll drop the value.
---
bahhahahhaha
---
i once had that happen in another game, i set some heal and buff macros, buffs were f1-f5 on mb1, and heals were alt+1-alt+5 on mb2. during a raid i panicked and hit both buttons together and the game shut down. it took me a few days of this happening before i figured out why the game kept dyeing.
---
Which is not relevant to what I'm saying. We asked for some stuff Anet delivered some stuff and the community was complimentary. So this guy is sure only one minor thing will be implemented. Will he come back to apologize if he's wrong, because I don't think he will.
---
Yeah, it could have. One thing I know for sure is that the value of the RM Trade also has a mayor impact on the ban length, regardless of it being the first, 2nd or 3rd strike.
---
And with this trade having a value of 20k gold, I sincerely doubt that the guy who bought that CES with RMT before selling it to OP also only got an 18 hour ban (assuming it was their first strike as well).
---
It's a player run market.  Prices are determined by the players.  ANet can try their best to curtail this, but anything short of actually increasing the droprate for this item isn't going to make it worth less in the player's eyes.
---
You can keep two full equipment sets in your build templates. Why it's in your bag?
---
worse, they might put then in the blc statuette vendor
---
I bound both template to the same f key using logitech software. Durpy not to let us do the same ingame, expected levels of durpy..
---
For me i think it was the right decision to uninstall after dragon's stand. There's a lot of cool stuff in gw2 but sadly most of it comes down to gems, gems and some more gems.  When most added content is none repetitive it is hard to stay invested in a mmo.
---
A couple might still be upset, but generally fellow raiders have been saying low, single monetization and less limitations would be much better. Including people like MightyTeaPot.  
---
So yes just fixing the slot issue alone wouldn't be enough.
---
you cant buy this item of the tp the tp dose not allow anything above 10k gold.So if someone buys something with real money and posts it on the tp does the buyer from the to get flagged too?
---
&gt; I see less evil in random scammer now and then, as opposed to organized artificiality market.
---
well, that was your initial point though.
---
&gt; While TP takes more gold , it also removed gold from game and lowers the inflation rate.
---
I agree here and this was the reason that even though I was a moderator of the exchange for like 2 years, I never really used it for personal trades in order to negate the tp tax.
---
&gt; What gw2e does is supports few rich to get even more , not removing gold from game, and making them able to manipulate price of specific items like infusions or MCs.
---
First of all, they support the whole player base, there is no rule that you have to have a certain amount of wealth in order to use it.
---
And if you have a closer look at how p2p trades work, they also dont really negate the tp tax either, if your end goal is to obtain gold for your sold item.
---
If someone decides to sell a legendary weapon worth 3k gold, they can either sell it on the tp (paying 450g in taxes) or find someone to trade it with for like 2k mystic coins (assuming their value to be 1.5g). But they wont be able to buy anything with these mystic coins on the tp. If they wanted to do that, they would need to liquidate the MC through the TP and in the process, they would pay the same 450g in taxes.
---
The only other option they have is to use those MC to trade for something else they need or want on the exchange or sell them in installments of 500g (due to the gold mail limit), which would take 6 weeks and you also wouldnt find someone who gives you the same gold as the lowest listing on the tp because in that case, they buyer would just buy them from the tp, which is a lot less hassle.
---
&gt; Hopefully Anet addresses the feedback in a satisfactory way.
---
And hopefully fairies will fly out of my ass and give me $100k.
---
&gt; Lol, no. It's a developer-run market. Prices are determined by the amount of supply the developers add items to the game.
---
Supply doesn't matter if there's zero demand for an item.  Players create demand.  This infusion would be worthless if no one wanted it.
---
&gt; If any item is deemed "too high" by the developer, they can fix that instantly by adjusting supply
---
This would be the case with this infusion, then.  Instead of banning people for going around the TP, maybe they should up the GP limit something can be bought or sold at or stop introducing high demand items with minimal droprates that reach said limit.
---
&gt; If any item is deemed "too high" by a player, they have no way of making that price lower.
---
So they can adjust and set prices but can't at the same time?
---
&gt; you cant buy this item of the tp the tp dose not allow anything above 10k gold.
---
Sure you can, you just buy it when someone lists it for 10K. If nobody is listing it for 10K, then *that* is the problem to fix.
---
&gt;So if someone buys something with real money and posts it on the tp does the buyer from the to get flagged too?
---
No, because it goes through ANet's systems and the one who put it there is properly flagged.
---
so the same should apply here the one that sold it should be flagged? he traded with real money. And why would anyone sell thiere infusion for 10k have 15% go away when they can sell it for 20k?
---
Guess what! I never have, during these 7 years, bought anything with real money from the gem store. Everything is bought with in-game gold to gems.
---
Use num pad numbers.
---
But ANet can track that it was a infusion that broke the RMT the can track who broke the rule and they can see that i have no correlation with those account same way they banned the last guy that made a big drama becouse they knew he was on 6 other acounts.
---
No multiple chak infusions are sold every week on exchange the people on the tp with 10k offers take it and sell it on the exchange to make 10k profit
---
Even if Mod Zedong on the official forums doesn't randomly remove and/or infract your feedback, Anet isn't going to listen on the official forums either... For the same result, we may as well hand the pleasure to other players.
---
Of course it is a troll post. 
---
If people don't type /s nowadays you won't get the sarcasm
---
Listening does not mean something should happen. It is just listening.
---
If you playsolo no problembut you will miss a ton of stuff of group play.
---
Haven't logged in for half a year now... Got nothing to look forward to with this game. I mean, season 5 is a huge joke. No expansion or anything huge to look forward to. 
---
Pretty sure Mike did the right thing by jumping ship. This game is fucking over, and it kills me inside...
---
you need to make sure this person is on the bad boy list on the subreddit, so more don't get stung
---
All the people who worked on GW1 were either let go or left, at least the ones who produced story content anyway
---
Their engineers will convert bugs into features.
---
&gt;Communication has definitely improved at ANet recently, and Mike Z absolutely loves playing the game as well as developing it. 
---
I harshly disagree. Mike Z has been nothing but a stain on this game. His decisions and vision for the game are nothing short but disastrous. I honestly cannot phantom a future in which the game will see a resurgence again, just like it did with HoT or when Season 4 started.
---
Stealth and Heal? Huh, I need to check it. Could be useful.
---
&gt;I was hoping for some unique cat-like humanoid form.
---
Catgirls in GW2? Wrong game.
---
BenP looks so uncomfortable.
---
Yeah I know that. I just find it crazy how a company under the same name can change so much. You’d think they would carry the same ideals and thought processes forwards.
---
&gt;NVMe SSD x 4
---
Why so many SSD?
---
I have had same SATA 120GB SSD for 5+ years...
---
&gt;unique cat-like humanoid form
---
So what you wanted was basically to put the [Become the Snow Leopard](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Become_the_Snow_Leopard) in a tonic? 
---
It is also not like they were actually hiding how it would look. We have been able to preview it since Tuesday.
---
Here is why an new engine is currently impossible for anet:
---
1. The engine Devs where hired by different comapnies (amazon etc)
---
2. The engine is an upgraded version of gw1 (ESO has an easier job upgrading their engine because they built their engine from scratch for that game)
---
3. The game is built upon this engine you cannot simply put a new one there 
---
4. The "task" as you call it is a massive Project.
---
6. Insulting anets codebase is no argument 
---
7. As a Programmer myself i can tell you that remembering how shit worked when old devs are gone is almost impossible. Hell i often forget how my code works after a few months.   
---
All in all whith NCsoft looking anet over the shoulder i don't think that anet could muster the resources to do this especially after their unannounced project got canned.
---
You know what, I've got the same story about the commander marks XD 
---
I was sure it was a great idea until I had to bind the fourth symbol... 
---
You got my sympathy and my upvote !
---
You can blame 'the management' for a lot of things, but blaming them 'rotting the community'? That is ridiculous. People reacting extraordinally hateful, rude and uncivilized is something people completely have control over themselves, and to shift the blame of that behaviour to anything else is downright silly.
---
No, I dont know. I dont think it is fair to assing such malicious intent to ANet before even seeing what they suggest for a remedy to the situation. Asserting that the goal of this template update is to just fuck over the player is asinine beyond belief.
---
It might be that they actually thought this update as is would improve the quality of life or the players and in reality it turned out to be kitten. Monetization is also unlikely in the hands of the developers who made the system.
---
I think it is common sense that no one thinks the current system is working as intended, not even Arenanet. Let's chill and wait for their actual response and then react accordingly.
---
I already did, I have played less and less and basically I haven't played since 3 days after the latest release. In fact, I actually had to reformat my desktop 3 days ago and I didn't even bother re-installing GW2.
---
I still lurk around the sub-reddit tho, maybe hoping a little bit. But ever since that "announcement" of theirs, I know only one direction this game is taking.
---
They really fucked up by not making a new expansion...
---
&gt; If you want Anet to listen to your feedback, you have to post over there.
---
I disagree. ANet have been censoring forums and banning people who critiqued their game and business practices. They're just another sleazy company right now, on that shouldn't be trusted with money or good will.
---
They can't censor shit here. You can call them out for fucking up every patch, you can point out how they're screwing us over and ignoring feedback, and you can even force their hand to fix shit if it causes a shitstorm. This is why open forums with (little to) no censorship are needed. A neutral turf is necessary to keep developers and publishers behaving, because official forums are just the extension of the game, and anything there can be shut down if it threatens income.
---
There being the alternative of buying everything with ingame gold helps a whole lot though. There are so many games out there where you dont have that luxury and its much harder to keep control knowing there is no alternative
---
I doubt whether that will happen at all at this time. With how unstable the servers were after the release of templates, they might not want to stress it even more by allowing 4 more slots
---
Until someone RMTs the 3k gold to buy the 2k item that's listed on the TP and all the gold+listing fees are gone.
---
&gt;new leadership
---
Yeah, the only problem is that O'Brien and many others weren't really working on GW2 for a while now, since PoF at very least. So all those disasters are on the "new" leadership. Of course, there is a chance that they will start to make different, better decisions but honestly, I don't believe that. For me personally it's the end of the story. I liked the game from the initial release, I fought buggy karka, I enjoyed the hell out of HoT, I liked PoF but everything, literally everything that came out after that wasn't for me. Starting from the ridiculous story and flashy mount skins. Maybe GW2 still has the future but not for me, not anymore.
---
Looking to make a quick gold, huh? The Order has been gathering some information about different methods so you can pick one you like. [Here is the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=how+to+make+gold&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=month)
---
-------
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Guildwars2) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
&gt;Yes but they allow tradeing on exchange.buying a tv from a can of stolen goods is not allowed!
---
They don't always punish it, that is not the same as allowing it. You accept ANY risks associated with the trade if you are not using the TP to make it.
---
They allow it Lead GM have posted on the exchange websit!
---
it's probably like prince thorn's staff "stealth" which is solely a visual effect
---
My ideal list of fixes for the build templates:
---
- Changing anything from a build or gear template marks that slot with an outline and a "save" button appears. Pressing save will save the current loadout to the template manually. Otherwise the template will continue to load what was there before.
---
- The cap is increased to 10 for both build and gear templates.
---
- Bulk purchase options are added for build and gear templates on the gemstore.
---
- Also, this is wishful thinking but the template slots could be purchased in-game for large amounts of WvW tournament tickets, PvP league tickets, fractal relics, or legendary insights/divinations. After all, the people that play those game modes enough to have tokens to spare probably are the ones most in need of templates.
---
- Legendary gear saves dyes and skin, not just stats and upgrades.
---
- Bugs are fixed.
---
- We can use special characters like hyphens and slashes in template names.
---
- We can reorder templates.
---
No. It gives you 3 second Stealth. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stalk_(Feisty_Feline)
---
So you're saying the OP is a thief? What kind of backwards logic is that? Buying a stolen item doesn't make you a thief, it certainly isn't a crime, and if the police takes your stolen item then you're entitled to your money back. That isn't the case here, not to mention Anet can get their gold back with a click.
---
There is an argument, and I already made it. Your logic is flawed as shit, you call the OP a thief when he got both his gold and Infusion lawfully. Calling you a bootlicker isn't a premise, it's a logical conclusion, and therefore it can't be a fallacy. Honestly, do you not even understand how fallacies work?
---
You can whine all you want, you've made it apparent you're a Anet bootlicker when you're using purposely flawed logic and moronic analogies in a hopeless attempt to defend their morally corrupt actions and policies.
---
&gt; I disagree. ANet have been censoring forums and banning people who critiqued their game and business practices. They're just another sleazy company right now, on that shouldn't be trusted with money or good will.
---
did you actually read the feedback in those forum posts? There arent many positive comments found either.
---
&gt; They can't censor shit here. You can call them out for fucking up every patch, you can point out how they're screwing us over and ignoring feedback
---
What point is there calling someone out, if they arent present?
---
Its pretty pathetic to think you are giving any kind of meaningful feedback if you are not directing it at the person that should listen to it and then complain that they arent listening.
---
&gt; and you can even force their hand to fix shit if it causes a shitstorm. This is why open forums with (little to) no censorship are needed. A neutral turf is necessary to keep developers and publishers behaving,
---
It only is a neutral turf, if both parties are behaving in a civilized manner. And I never said that everybody should stop using reddit to express their views, just dont expect Anet to read or interact with it.
---
&gt; official forums are just the extension of the game, and anything there can be shut down if it threatens income.
---
Censoring bad or useless feedback on the forums wont shut down that feedback coming to light on other public forums, like reddit, so thats not the main reason why the censor it. They just do it in order to better address and consider the good/valuable feedback.
---
They allow it at their discretion. *You are responsible for any penalties that result.*
---
I've been spending an average of 10€/month since release, plus both deluxe pack expansions. Never has it even once crossed my mind to ever trade gems to gold.
---
Where's the lie though :D
---
When it comes to build templates this is the last thing that needs fixing
---
yes my penelty  the infusion is taken. But i also get other people's penalties? if you see that as fair that's your opinion
---
Jesus Christ the IQ on some people...
---
The current implementation is more akin to build slots rather than templates. A template is something you plop on, then modify without altering the template, which is not the case right now
---
Does not mean the flag goes away. Even if it's not your fault your account was involved in it
---
&gt;So you're saying the OP is a thief? What kind of backwards logic is that? 
---
...what? No. Hot damn dude go back and re-read what I wrote, you're so convinced I'm wrong that you're completely short-circuiting your reading comprehension.. 
---
&gt; if the police takes your stolen item then you're entitled to your money back.
---
But if the police can't put the thief in front of a judge, they're not going to give you the money themselves. 
---
&gt; Anet can get their gold back with a click.
---
And that's why I talked about the differences between real life and digital stolen goods, and brought up how impossible it is for anet to verify that OP is not part of a network laundering stolen goods. That's not calling OP a thief. That's saying that Anet can't rule out that he's in league with the thief, and thus the only way to keep the game safe from illegal activity is to simply remove the item. This is why they tell people do not trade outside the trading post. 
---
&gt; Honestly, do you not even understand how fallacies work?
---
Far better than you. For one thing, I understand that there is no way to construct a logical argument that results in "you are a boot licker" based on thr information provided. 
---
&gt; You can whine all you want, you've made it apparent you're a Anet bootlicker when you're using purposely flawed logic and moronic analogies in a hopeless attempt to defend their morally corrupt actions and policies.
---
Oh get off your high horse ya blowhard. Removing stolen items without compensation is standard practice, for the reasons I've outlines, and you're white knighting for OP much harder than I'm defending anet. Did you miss the part where you're more upset about the lost gold than OP? Might be a clue to you.
---
1. REMOVE TEMPLATES
---
2. COME BACK WITH ACTUAL BUILD TEMPLATS. BRING BACK BUILD WARS
---
3. YES, I AM INTERNALLY SCREAMING BUT I AM GENERALLY A VERY CHILL PERSON
---
&gt; when out of curiosity I looked into how much money I've spent on this game over the years. Turns out I've spent an average of $62 per month
---
How can you look up how much money you've spent?
---
Again, if you report it and they take care of it, the flag goes away. 
---
Assuming you did nothing wrong.
---
Like buy or sell items on a black market trading site. 
---
Which is what *you* did and got punished for doing.
---
Because you did the thing they punished you for.
---
I did not trade with real money as i told you many times i got punished for real money trading if i the punish was for trading outside of the game fair but it is for real money trading.
---
Lets agree to disagree you think its fair i don't.
---
When this CAT guild organises an event like that, will they just open an LFG party before the boss event? Or is there an event schedule they follow, so people know when they do one?
---
Ah, it's a preparation skill. Haven't looked at those yet since they have been added. Thanks for the info!
---
Everyone is mad at the moment.  If the general mood was favorable I'd be ganged up on for bringing this up.  I know from experience.
---
It's a good game if the main thing you enjoy is running around in open world and doing some meta events now and then and a bit of story every 4months.
---
If you want a mmo for story mainly i wouldn't actually advice gw2, because on top of the 25$ expac you need to pay around 60euro more for the 3seasons. And then to play comfortable you want some extra bag slots and maybe a couple of bank slots to store your junk. While this isn't a must you'll find yourself running out of bag space really because the mobs in this game drops a lot of trash items they expect you to sell to vendors.
---
But anyway of your main focus is story/pvp/endgame pve content there are better options out there. Especially because those options still look like the got a bright future ahead of them.
---
&gt;Rotted this entire community to its foundations
---
Lmao the hyperbole
---
You are so brave
---
Sorry for the late reply. I wasn't active. Core necro has a signet that gives you 25% ms at all times, so it's mobility is good enough for leveling. Also when you want to level your toon quickly you can farm the lab during halloween and get lvls crazy fast. Or farm events in highlands. You should be able to get to 80 in no time. For a weapon, dagger is decent. But there are builds where you sit mostly in the shroud and one shot mobs all the way until lvl 80.
---
maybe you didnt comprehend this:
---
&gt; we are reading the feedback expressed **in this thread and the other forums threads** about the Build and Equipment Templates.
---
you have to post over there, not caps lock on reddit
---
Bought cheapest core game, xpacs and alt account, never bought gems with money, 13k hours on main 3k on alt
---
Most player with multiple accounts probably just abuse the f2p for free farming.
---
I dont think Anet cares about them all that much.
---
&gt; The scenario being discussed is that items costing 10K now would cost 5K after
---
That's not how inflation works at all.
---
Arc or ark?
---
Trading items outside of the trading post isn't against the rules you nitwit. OP broke no rules, they just got caught up in a shitty situation due to some RWTers. Flagging an account for that is horseshit.
---
Okay so the maximum amount of account wide Build ***Storage*** Templates, which are a seperate thing from individual character Build Templates, is 24. You get 3 for free by default and then purchase them in packs of 3 from the gemstore up to 24 total. To celebrate the launch of templates they allowed you to claim 1 pack of 3 from the gemstore for free for the first week they're out.
---
For real... truly the GW2 struggle is loving the world of GW2, loving the characters, loving the amount of detail and affection team members try to put into things... and absolutely hating ArenaNet.
---
A missed opportunity was to let us bind the same key for equipment AND build switch, so we could swap the entire build with a single button..
---
But at least i'm enjoying the equip switch button to finally give my engi an my ele a weapon swap
---
Yeah, this is what the developer has to say about it:
---
&gt; Pop-ins/slow loading/missing objects  
---
&gt;*Troubleshooting*  
---
&gt;This is normal for clean/first install as tool generates shader cache from ground up. After shader cache is generated, load times will be much faster. If you want to eleminate this problem once and for all, use [PSO precompile](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Using-PSO-precompile) and/or ready-to-use shader [packs](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Shader-packs)
---
Back of a van that is fine so long as what you buy isn't stolen goods. Purchase at your own risks, be responsible for the consequences if things go south. If you don't want the risk of a flag on your account, stick to the TP.
---
Exactly.
---
Yeah, i agree, i got used to use the numpad to switch mount istantly, and now i'm regretting it, since it could be pretty nice to use those 9 buttons for this
---
yea but noone tells you what stole goods are and if you resell the stuff from the van other people will get in truble for it
---
Yes, but you’ll be waiting for several months before they accrue enough value to even break even with the TP tax
---
&gt; Trading items outside of the trading post isn't against the rules you nitwit. 
---
But it IS done at your own risk, so if rules are broken in the process, you're 100% responsible for those rules having been broken. There's nothing illegal about buying an item off the back of a van either, it's just sketchy, and potentially a scam, and if it *is,* you're responsible for the consequences.
---
I used it for mounts, and i'm so used to it that i cant change it..
---
If you don't have an immediate need for gold, it's always better to sell anything at a higher price. The question is if the price will go up. If you know that by looking at past price behavior for that item, it could be a safe bet.
---
Possession of stolen items is still illegal no matter how many hands it passes through, so don't buy form shady sources. They may not prosecute if they feel you genuinely didn't intend to do it, but they always *can.*
---
&gt; when the law is inconvenient, people do crimes.
---
Again, trading outside of the TP is not against the rules, they just said they wont help you if you get scammed. It is absolutely not grounds for punishing someone like OP in this case.
---
I bet the most well known shortcut is ctrl-alt-del
---
Thank you for the detailed write-up. That sounds like a car that switches between slow and fast gear and crashes left and right into the guardrails frequently. Now I understand why the "always the same, but slightly different and refreshed" approach of updates for FFXIV is sometimes criticised but generally lauded. It also explains  why the little stuff I had heard about GW2 has been so inconsistent.
---
Neither is buying things off the back of a van, but if those things happen to be stolen, you can still get prosecuted for possession of stolen merchandise. 
---
Again, "the TP is not meeting my needs" does not excuse anything you do to circumvent it.
---
You're level 12, dude. You haven't even cleared the starting map and guess what, combat is super-easy in the starting maps. Of course it'll get harder later on. Maybe play more than a single afternoon before you go on a diatribe about the intricacies of combat and ingame mechanics, because right now you really don't know anything about either.
---
Also, "girls-game"? Your friend's an asshole.
---
again with the dont buy they allow people to buy from there lead gms said so but there's no point in having the argument with you we went threw it ones you saw that i proved you wrong you changed the topic and now you wanna bring it back!
---
Would be a nice time for them to add radial menus for builds, mounts, squad markers, etc.
---
Amazing that you were able to make a rogue .
---
well anet refuse to post here since its so mismanaged
---
Did you or did you not get caught in possession of an item that had, at one point, been obtained via illicit means?
---
*Apples, apples for sale, come and get a nice quiet apple!* Psst! Over here Initiate.

If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
mmm just 15k? i miss the days when we could do 30k plus
---
It's not as simple as that. There is no GW2 alternative at hand, it's very unique as an MMO. Furthermore, people have friends in the game, they have poured money into it and have thus a very good reason to "fight" for its future.
---
Please keep us updated every 12 levels
---
The way one apparently pays for story progress/updates in GW2 sounds very strange to me. As for rewriting the story, FFXIV did the same in 2.0 but the new intro video and information scattered throughout the main story quest makes having played 1.0 superfluous. The GW2 approach sounds horrible.
---
I'm using num pad numbers for mounts, control+num pad for gear templates, and alt+num pad for build templates.
---
I have friends in gw2 but I don’t need to play the game to remain friends with them. I and I’m sure a lot of other people aren’t going to keep playing a game just because it’s unique as an mmo and not much of an alternative. I don’t need an mmo in my life especially if it doesn’t feel like a worthy time investment.
---
If you like running around very pretty maps with ok story whilst
---
Wouldn't unclicking "Adjust camera to character height"? solve the camera problem?
---
Imma be blunt - because of they way boons work, you will always play in melee range in any instanced content regardless of your weapon set.(except in some very specific kiting encounters)  
---
When you are not in the stack, you lose boons, you don't give boons, and you make ppls life very hard because they need to leave the stack to rez u when u are downed.  
---
This doesn't mean you can't play however you want, in lower tier content. There are lots of different fun playstyle which are ranged.  
---
But in a group, to pull your weight - you will be inside the stack at melee range. It is impossible for you to do that when you recieve almost no boons if you are away from the stack. It can be the difference between doing 14k and 35k.
---
"If I get disappointed I have the right to be an asshole!" 
---
Some people choose to forever stay childish, and not in the good way...
---
You're level 12....
---
Is this a troll post?
---
Being prosecuted for possession of stolen goods generally requires you to have known they were stolen. In this case there was no reasonable way for OP to know.
---
Dude! I was just about to say the same! 
---
I agree with you and I think that as "The forums need to be made less hostile to dissent . . ." our (some players) tone needs to go down significantly. Your post is a great example of how to do it right. 
---
I have hope that Anet will figure it out. After the shock of "you have phones, don't you?" Blizzard seems to finally gotten the message, despite their Hong Kong mess which goes to show that no one is perfect but this time around Blizzard did not come out with some nonsense and it looks like they are going to give players what they have been asking for: Diablo 4.
---
Maybe Anet will start to listen too.
---
Yeah I hope the community doesn’t accept this.
---
It’s like the other day. We as a community jumped to the conclusion that ArenaNet had banned players for using ArcDPS (which was both the community and ArenaNet’s fault), and then when ArenaNet announced what really happened, so many people were saying “ok can we stop being mad at ArenaNet now?”
---
NO! We were already mad because of the build template preview. The supposed bannings were the cherry on top. Just because one of our complaints got fixed, it doesn’t mean we should forgive ArenaNet for the other shit. 
---
This is way ArenaNet is hoping will happen again.
---
for new characters that you will buy
---
I disagree and am happy with it. It comes with a stealth! The 6 second bleed on the autoattack is something that might be useful on some class somewhere (but probably not), and the leap on the 2 skill will let me cross gaps in old dungeons.
---
When playing Condi Engi back in the day i used ALT as my modifing key for Attacks, Of course i also had skills bound to f1-f5, and even f1-f3 with alt as a modifier thinking i was smart since i wont hit ALT+F4. Welp guess what happened a few times (in raids ofc) before i bothered to change it.
---
You're playing the easy-mode content from 2012.
---
Anet likely was trying get into the mobile market. It's a lot bigger than PC gaming, worth trillions &amp; it's all very basic stuff at a design level.
---
rogue.... wrong game  
---
girls game ....... sorry the game isn't up to your penis' performance maybe try hello ktity island adventure
---
you're at the start of the game, maybe play for 40 hours or atleast wait till you get to HoT before crying about combat
---
why cant i see the post on reddit page anymore when it just was top 1 yesterday?
---
I searched the whole wardrobe for this kind of tiara, but did not find it. I saw this player wearing it. So what is this? https://imgur.com/ewttquh
---
2 out of the 3 main game modes, PvP and WvW, have long been abandoned.  Only the living story gets like 2 hours worth of content every 3-4 months while every other aspect of PvE like raids, fractals and dungeons have been abandoned too.
---
They simply don't have the manpower to keep updating all 3 game modes. The studio has bled talent and experienced devs like there's no tomorrow, almost everybody is jumping ship.
---
Anet has got a lot of things wrong as of late and the game feels directionless. To top it all off, communication has been lacking for years and anet has never ever had a proper community manager.
---
ctrl-c is I’d bet, and I still know plenty of people that don’t know about shortcuts. People really overestimate what the average computer user knows.
---
"The people who don’t believe there should be .000001% dropchance items in the game that some people will never own are wildin."
---
Yes, but those items shouldn't be worth more than 10k to begin with. 10k is almost 3x Eternity. That's 6 legendaries. More than enough for crazy rare luxury items. And like others have said, the inflation that would follow a higher cap isn't worth it.
---
FYI, the droprate is probably much, much lower than 1.0x5^10. The number of people that have completed Gerent every day would have produced many more infusions.
---
[deleted]
---
&gt; It's almost unbelievable that anyone that uses a computer, especially someone savvy enough to be a PC gamer and be a reddit user, wouldn't know literally the most well-known keyboard shortcut or the prank of tricking people into using it.
---
The reason that prank is still around is because it still works. A huge portion of people don’t know about keyboard shortcuts. Plenty of those people game. This still may be a troll post, but it’s really not uncommon for someone not to know alt-F4 or even ctrl+C. I’d say most gamers don’t know about alt-enter and they’re pretty much the only people that need to use that shortcut.
---
Downvoted for using a 60% keyboard. You hate to see it.

Christ. I know the subreddit is salty, but this clip is totally out of context of the rest of the stream. Cal has a dry sense of humor, and this was several hours into a late night stream of having some laughs. This is not the venue for balance discussion.

They've said multiple times there's a small patch coming shortly to bring over performing specs in line, and a big patch behind that will work towards bringing down the TTK.

P2w tonic, have fun exploiting maps.

https://youtu.be/MVqXiXTrpvk

&gt;Tell me, how is anyone trading outside of the TP supposed to reasonably know whether or not something is tied to RWT? They can't. 
---
seems you are only interested in off topic drama, good luck
---
No, that would require me to reverse-engineer the game and intrude into its inner workings. I don't want to step that far into gray territory. But I doubt I could even if I wanted to.

Like I said the weaver as a class/spec is honestly fine. I've heard complaints about the rotation being difficult, but I enjoy it
---
I feel this system is counterintuitive and you need to make a lot of unneeded actions. Took me 15 minutes to understand how it works LOL.
---
I am guessing you are referring to the infamous IC saga live announcement. Feels bad indeed.
---
as you can see on your 14% upvoted thread (were you just ask a harmless question), this sub is completely dogshit and I would recommend to ignore it and just play the game with your wife. its in a good state. plenty of stuff to do and updates are coming on a regular basis. game is far from dead.
---
You're correct. If nothing changes, I will have no choice but to walk away - this is my plea for something to change.
---
Works fine for me
---
Well, many players with multiple accounts often get a bit of a wealth boost from it. Extra daily rewards, extra birthday presets, gifting their main account when something is free the first time in the TP.
---
For accounts that were purchased, it's a fair reward for those who pay for more accounts, but for Free accounts they may have done nothing to deserve that bonus.
---
So to compensate, the system could be adjusted to only kick in after a certain amount if the transfer is between two paid accounts, like 500g as that's also the daily withdraw cap (added between all transactions within a time, so they do not break them into many messages of 499g99s99c). Still makes it more desirable to use the TP for large sums, but it won't affect most of the tamer 'community' use of mail transfers.
---
&gt; i like to play stealthy, sneaky guys
---
&gt; feels more cowardly
---
...isn't it the point?!
---
Double click it and a message shows in the chat window.
---
Hahaha man i remember pranking kids with this
---
I had an issue I deleted the exe and redownload it again and it worked
---
Oh cool, I get that reference
---
As a 7year veteran who plays all three modes actively, I still hope Arenanet will go back to the drawing board and make meaningful changes to the system. This is my last hope. I want to believe that arenanet will listen to the vast majority of the players and the feedback given to them. I hope they have the guts to admit they were wrong and fix a broken feature. I hope they can mend the dmg they caused to the community and the game. Else this is the last straw for me. I have been online playing this game for 7 years. The last 10 days I don't even want to log in anymore.
---
My hopes are:
---
Combine Equipment Templates + Build Templates and add them to the "Account Bound Templates" UI. Proper templates with Save/Load buttons and all. 
---
If it must, remove completely the ability to "store" gear in the templates themselves. It has caused WAY more problems than solutions.
---
Well, thatshaman datamined there are more slots coded in xd
---
Hard to say without knowing what your character wears exactly ... and even if you know that it would just be an approximate assumption 
---
You could link your gear and build here by putting it in gw2skills.net and send the share link 
---
Also about laurel or dungeon bought ... ascended is ascended as long as you got the right stats
---
You get infusions for gaething crystals, not LDs. Honestly the only sink for LDs I can think of is buying LIs with them.
---
I prefer ctrl-shift-esc, straight to the task manager without needing to click on it in that pesky screen.
---
&gt; All in all whith NCsoft looking anet over the shoulder i don't think that anet could muster the resources to do this especially after their unannounced project got canned.
---
This much we can agree on. 
---
I also want to point out. I'm not demanding in any shape or form that they do a new engine. Just saying it as a hypothetical thing. I'm aware of how extensive and massive such a project would be. I'm in no way downplaying it.
---
&gt; Insulting anets codebase is no argument 
---
I am not. Even A-Net has akknowledged just how messed up their code is. They even called it "spaghetti code". It wasn't just this sub who coined the term.
---
I just used the number pad since switching builds is no big deal to be so out of the way and no need to use a modifier
---
Yesterday, to get The Extra Life.
---
It's a mechanical keyboard...
---
If you play fps games the bigger your mousepad the better, and not having a numpad lets me get more desktop real estate.
---
I bought PoF, im the content buying type of customer and not so much the microtransactions type.
---
A few years ago, bought account upgrades and a couple of skins. After that, I only use gold because that's all I can do. If not I would buy more stuff with cash. Namely mounts.
---
couple days ago for Build Template expansion
---
Last time was a week ago on the aurine charity thingy, before that august right before the icebrood saga announcement.
---
Before that i spend weekly / mountly in 2019 a few 100 € so far but i wont continue if anet cant deliver content.
---
Everyone was against cash shops when they first came out, the excuse was that they were exclusively found on f2p games as the only way to generate revenue, and here we are today, some of us have to pay a copy of a game, plus a subscription and is generously offered cosmetics microtransactions that could be included as some kind of reward for in game content or QOL changes that should be free or purchasable with GOLD and not GOLD TURNED INTO GEMS. I can't believe people defend this kind of shit, well good for them if they are happy with it, buy I'm not buying any of that

It's all there for everyone to see. Put it all together. Is it really just coincidences, or a cry for help?
---
Great comment 10/10
---
https://youtu.be/dSwTynT3bsU yeah really fun ;D
---
[Here’s](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Converter) a list of converters in the game. Look for the ones that take bloodstone dust or whatever you have laying around and see which ones are easy for you to get.
---
I also recommend you craft up some bloodstone bricks, which will be used in high level gear crafting a ton. Having a few refined ascended garbage will save you time.
---
I don’t recall anything significant that can be bought with unbound magic. The gold conversion is mediocre, and obsidian shards are kinda a waste unless you’re desperate for them. I would recommend you just keep it until you need it for something. You may need it for more trinkets, gold, obsidian shards, some cool gizmo I don’t know about or whatever, but it’ll always be waiting for you.
---
Just go play into higher zone. If you want challenge, fight mobs that are 10 levels above you. Try not to die too much.
---
Most important thing is to make sure the stats, runes and sigils are the same as in the guides. The next step is getting all ascended trinkets as those add around 10% more DMG compared to exotics. Then ascended weapons, then armor last. ASC Weapons and armor should contribute around 5% more. Food and utilities should be around 3-4%. Infusions are almost negligible, around 1%.
---
Note that these are all estimates. It's fairly easy to get maxed out gear in this game so I'd suggest shooting for that first - your first set of ascended gear is always the hardest bc with better gear you do better in fractals and raids which shit out ascended items.
---
Yeah I really dislike when people are attempting to make serious and thought provoking discussion threads, but then use terms like that.  I would suggest trying to tone it down a bit OP. While I understand the point you're trying to make, when I see words like "stupid" etc, to me, it weakens my trust that you're being rational and fair. I start to think your just being hostile and question whether I should hear you out.  Just so friendly thoughts, take em or leave em.
---
I'll mirror my thoughts here:
---
My biggest problem is that ANet had an "ACTUAL TEMPLATE" of what the  community was expecting as a"bare minimum" of build templates if they  were to look at the DeltaConnected developed solution (ARC Templates).  
---
 The discussion in the office should have been: "here is what they have  now - and it works and they are happy with it - how can we make them  happier? How can we take what they are using - what we said they can use  - and improve upon it?"
---
If I were king of Anet - the official build templates  development/implementation would have gone something akin to the  following:
---
**Create an Armory**  
---
 Each paid account would receive for free a 20 slot Armory - expandable  to something like 200 slots via gems at a rate equivalent to bag slot  expansion (3-400 gems / 20 slots). This Armory would be the basis for  equipment storage, and the means to monetize a portion of the templates.  Armory expansion would be the ONLY portion of templates monetized, as  it effectually shared storage. The Armory would be account wide storage,  and allow for easy sharing of equipment, infusions, runes, etc. between  characters  
---
 Each piece of equipment, rune, sigil, infusion, etc. when equipped would  have an option (via a check-box that you could default to on or off) to  be returned to the armory when unequipped. Each equipped item would be  able to be edited in the hero panel to change your preference on where  the item goes - for example if you change your mind and want your  equipped sword to stay in your inventory rather than returning to the  armory as you initially selected - you would drill into the item and  un-tick the "return to armory" box. Equipment, et al. that is unequipped  without being flagged as "return to armory" would be moved to that  characters inventory when unequipped.
---
**Release an Actual Build Template System**  
---
 *Builds in GW2 are complex, in that a build involve traits, equipment  c/w runes, sigils &amp; infusions, and skills. Each of these forms an  interlocking part of an actual build - so why separate them?*
---
The development of this feature already exists - DeltaConnected  already did it for ANet. I would have either hired/contracted Delta or  bought his code - then polished the UI to be an integral part of the  game code rather than a add-on / overlay.
---
If a build was loaded that required equipment, the first equipment  pass would look in the characters inventory. The second pass would look  in the armory. If the equipment was not found in either - the user would  be notified that part of their builds "equipment (XX) could not be  located." Honestly - this is a problem for the user to solve - as it  isn't up to ANet to manage where the player puts their stuff.
---
That's It!...Build Templates....Yay!
---
Admittedly, I am not huge into this, but I know those who are and it  was irksome to them that their dye jobs were being lost with templates  so:
---
**Fashion Wars Templates**  
---
 Each character gets 2 free fashion templates. These hold default dye  colors per channel for your characters preference. These templates,  could again be expanded on a per character basis for a moderate amount  of gems (50 per)
---
In every economy, greed leads people to break the law and they will be punished for it, too.
---
10k is a lot of money for a lot of people already and frankly, is not an unreasonable cap. The amount of items you can get ingame is continuously growing, so don't worry about people getting all the items.
---
Same, Me as well (and thanks for your contribution!)
---
Euhhhh.... Do you seriously not get how freemium games operate? A small playerbase that whales, little dolphins, rest feel terrible to be feasted upon by whales. Thats the plan in every Korean MMO (with lewd stuff). So yeah, patches that INTEND to alienate playerbase will be pushed out to get an advantage to whales and accepting the minimal loss from the dolphins. 
---
IF a SINGLE PERSON makes these prices, then thats like 300% more reason to shit on ANet, jfc. Thats not even remotely ok, for any company, in any department.
---
Meh. Fucking up royally by ignoring feedback for 2 weeks isnt the best precedent for "giving fair chance".
---
~800 gems for some total makeover kits, by far my #1 purchase as a big fashion wars fan. 
---
Before that I think I bought myself a random mount license as a graduation present. I like the default mounts just fine but I don't like their limited dye channels so I'm always happy with whatever I get
---
And what about not to be so greedy and be ok with 10k?:-)
---
It's supposed to expire a month after the template patch came in, which would be late November.
---
If you aren't back in town until December and miss it, it's not that big of a deal, as "build storage" is the same functionality you can duplicate with Alt-Tab and Notepad to store a chat code.  Yes, having it in-game is more convenient, but the out of game solution takes maybe five seconds longer.  It's not the same as getting actual extra template slots for builds or gear that you can automatically switch to with the press of a button.
---
That sucks. Does most recent reshade miss out UI and disable GW2 bloom like Hook does.
---
The Extra Life bundle when it released.
---
Can't even gift the templates zzzz
---
One of the mount pack skins, don't recall the name, a little over a year ago. Haven't needed to since I got deep into Fractals.
---
They should just turn it into an open world map at this point
---
Is that a real QA response?  Yeah, it's funny but I hope they gave him a real answer too.
---
100g. Not much but good for an ultra casual like me.
---
Few days ago for Extra Life
---
Make sure you are fully-buffed and the golem is fully-debuffed.  That's the most important part.  Your gear doesn't need to be perfect but having the right boons and buffs (eg; Banner of Strength, Discipline, Spotter, Empower Allies etc) matters!

---
Outside of a vacuum or ideal raid-environment you'll seldom have perfect Might, Fury, Quickness or Alacrity.  People don't take boons/buffs particularly seriously until T4; even then there are many people that do casual Fractals.
---
You can set it up to be close enough, by using the same keys just with a modifier.  Make your build swap NumPad 1/2/3, for example, and your equipment swap Ctrl+Numpad 1/2/3.
---
I bought 5 bank expansions, and 10 BL keys, right before bound by blood episode.
---
And people dared to complain about this tonic.
---
I prefer thinking like [this](https://youtu.be/JeVBt536w_U).
---
What do you do if you want to alt-tab (or quit via alt-f4 for that matter)?
---
They're slowly working in that direction.  A little while back, they changed the Sunspear Outfit that was a PoF bonus to make the skirt's cloth move more realistically.  Since then, the Racing Scarves have been added, which aren't fully capes but still have better cloth physics than we've seen so far.
---
Bit by bit, they're headed in that direction.
---
Its a button on the keyboard, i can turn game-mode on and off.

500 gems for cape slot, does not fit in backpack slot. Per character. Capes only available with the Cape Adoption License for 400 gems each. A Selectable version is also available for 800 gems. Special capes are for sale for 1,200 gems.
---
For a limited time, grab your one free cape slot from the gem store!
---
Some games, for sure Starcraft 2 has options do disable alt+f4, or windows key
---
&gt;  I mean, come on dude. If you have a micro-transaction based game, why would you want to intentionally alienate the player base? 
---
That’s EXACTLY why you alienate the playerbase. Micro transaction games thrive off of whales spending large amounts of cash. If you alienate all the cheap players then that is analyzed and typically viewed as an “acceptable loss” because you make so much more fucking money off the whales to compensate.
---
I did the same thing. Realized what I was doing right as I set it. You know how like when you stub your toe it takes a half a second or so for you to realize it and THEN it hurts? That’s kinda like that.
---
And then the REALLY sad part is I did it AGAIN when setting up equipment templates too 😂
---
Enemies below level 15 are very simplistic and have very little health and hardly ever use complex skills.
---
In Core maps, even level 80 enemies will be generally below average in difficulty. And when they are difficult, it's because they hit way too hard and can oneshot players easily, and have lots of health, like dungeon elites, not because they have tricky mechanics that one has to learn. 
---
It isn't until Season 1 that difficulty began to ramp up. And since S1 is no longer available and S2 has to be bought, there's a huge jump in difficulty between Personal Story and HoT. 
---
So you will have a lot of fun with that.
---
A cape. 2k gold in GW1. 1200 gems at GW2. Thanks for playing.
---
PS: 2k gold in GW1 would be like 2 golds in GW2, just saying.
---
It says in the tooltip that it gives you different skills. It’s a combat tonic because you can actually fight, unlike a costume brawl tonic and unlike a transform that can’t do anything.
---
It’s just a neat little novelty to play with. Get some friends in game to make a little army of kittens, go to WvW and have a kitten war. Test the limits of kitty combat.
---
I’m not actually such if it works in WvW, haven’t tested it myself.
---
best tonic ever
---
Now, stop asking for things you WOULD pay for and ask for thimgs you need before you leave the game. Or they will make you pay for it.

At this rate they'll end up just putting huge invisible walls all over the edges of the map where players are supposed to stand, and be done with it.

Yes I confused myself

That's because we used to tell people to press that if they asked how to get into the options since it was f10.

We'll have to coordinate more in the future, I think. I've been running my trains for well over a year now, so I find it strange that you didn't see this coming.

---
PoF. And before that, HoT.
---
People WANT to believe ArenaNet is getting better. Simply put, with the past few months the good will the community ever had for the devs is being quickly burned up. You’ll see less and less understanding and compassion as time goes on until Anet actually extends an olive branch and tries to fix their damn game.
---
It's literally impossible to buy chak egg sac in any other way. There are over 40 buy orders @ 10k for it and with current droprate they will never get completed.
---
oh thx I will try this and see if it helps.
---
Memes aside, do you really need to keybind an out-of-combat action?
---
Really, many, many thanks for rescuing my toons, I've been completing my dailies with a generic alt toon without doing any kind of specialized content for over two weeks due to the lack of templates.  
---
Just a small request, would it be possible to add an option to save slight adjustments in traits/skills or generate a whole build code within your interface without having to recur to the game UI?
---
if you playing pve/pvp/wvw with more than one char you are fucked.
---
Same thing is happening to me. Been trying for the past hour.
---
Then people should be pushing for them to increase the drop rate, shouldn't they? 
---
The point is, the only reason nobody is filling those orders is because they know the black market exists. If they can get 20K on the black market then why sell it for 10K? But if the black market doesn't exist, then 10K would be the best possible price they could *ever* hope to get it, and 10K is better than nothing. 
---
So the only reason they are not selling for 10K right now is because there is a black market, and ANet hasn't yet shut it down entirely. They could, and probably should, it would help keep things on the level. 
---
And *then* they can work on making it so that "10K+" items are more plentiful so that supply meets demand.
---
Yes
---
Since the Berserker rework, Empower Allies is increasingly becoming more rare.
---
Works for me.
---
"Student's money"??
---
Oh, yeah, now I remember. FF14 also sells story boosts that complete the story quests for you because alts are forced to do them if they wanna do the new story. That's kinda weird...
---
But man I miss playing FF 14... and all I did was play the demo. Forced myself to quit because reaching level 20 and then quitting was going to be painful.
---
I disagree. The trolling is way too obvious.
---
I'm not sure it's actually possible. From the description of build templates they are character bound b/c they are literally equipping and unequiping items on the specific character. Which is why there is the "defect" of no changing visible/invisible gear pieces when you swap from build to build. There is no swapping b/c it is literally doing the existing actions of equipping/de-equipping on the character.
---
For it to be account bound would be to have some bit of code so that on every purchase of a build template AND on every creation of a new character to go through every one and unlock it. That is too specific and convoluted to do.
---
Yes, it SHOULD be considered nothing because it’s a pre-fabricated fix for a problem they intentionally caused. They created a need and then expanded the feature already, it’s just locked away until they need to cash in that good will coin you’re clamoring for. Don’t you see how you’re being manipulated?
---
Interesting suggestions.
---
That means
---
* F2P players would get baseline 2 equipment slots and 3 build template slots - a nice incentive to buy the expansion, on top of the other benefits of getting the paid campaign
---
* Yeah I was super bummed when I saw build slot 2 and 3 were for PvP and WvW - we effectively lost those 2 slots... Splitting the slots for gamemode would be _perfect_
---
* The build storage idea is neat - 10 per campaign means 20 for F2P, 30 for PoF owners, yet another great incentive and goes hand in hand with unlocked eSpecs - more specs, more builds, more storage needed.
---
* Equipment unlocks being accountwide sounds the most reasonable thing ever - especially for altoholics like me, I often delete characters to create new ones ahaha - I'd hate to lose those unlocks!
---
* Price reduction everywhere - of course. Anet is becoming incr**EA**singly greedy and I really dislike it.
---
Your personal insults mean nothing, little man.
---
This is going to be weird as thematically they're pretty different, but Destiny 2 might scratch that itch for a bit. The buy in isn't bad and content releases are pretty frequent.
---
They DID just make it way worse to get bright dust on your own and silver is now cash shop only, so the monetization side is getting worse. But the buy in gets you enough to play the game for real - no bank tabs or character slots or build template BS.
---
The scale of the game feels more like an expansive polished Borderlands than a MMO. I've enjoyed it. Never loved it maybe, not like Gw2 when it was good, but it might be worth some time to you.
---
Last was warclawskin ~ 20€, round about 4 weeks ago..
---
Before this, I dont know.

I made a necro because i got tired of bad groups just fell in love with it and never turned back used to main revenant lol
---
It won't be for long now that you posted a video of it.
---
Neither does your post. (shrug) Just empty, salty words from a kid who can't get over the fact that GW 1 died and is on life support and that the sequel didn't live up to his self conceived fantasies.
---
I know why! Because I don't do HoT every time. I switch between Central Tyria. So last month on the first weekend was THE PILGRIMAGE ACROSS TYRIA Central run. Then next weekend is the X-pacs. I've also been doing mine for several years. However, I'm not very public about it. At the most I do is a simple reddit thread. However, I have to say that your event sounds far more interesting then mine! Lots of stuff! Well done!
---
I've got a couple hundred hours in it. It gets better after the first two stories, but until they release the revised ARR and post ARR updates, it's just not worth playing 100 hours until it gets interesting.
---
What bothers me the most is when they are not refunded when the character is deleted.
---
If a hacker enters your account and deletes everything, you won't lose most of all other gemstore upgrades as they are account unlocks. You'll only lose inventory slots, permanent salvage kits and 
---
everlasting gathering tools, which should also be account unlocks instead specific items.  
---
Also, account birthdays should be based on the account, not on the oldest character.
---
Can we talk about why an item in the game is twice the cost of the market cap to begin with? Games should not have items like that.
---
Please adopt this cute little cape. He is good with kids, always greets you when you come home and likes to sleep by your side.
---
i have BIG PLANS with my garden since 2010.
---
Since you can only receive 500 gold per week in mail, how do you trade 20k? With stacks of item? Let's say mystic coins. Why avoiding paying 15% of tax of a Xk gold item, but agreeing to pay 15% of tax of an amount of mystic coins of Xk gold value. Either way you will pay the same 15% tax over the same item value.
---
When products are designed and marketed to elicit an emotional reaction, you are surprised when people act emotionally?

Companies have a huge role in determining how their community interacts.  It’s part of their job.  People hate mtx, being nickel and dimed, and their time and money being disrespected.

Blaming the community is just as juvenile and naive.  Not everyone is eloquent when expressing their grievances.  But you are lumping in obvious trolls and bad faith individuals with the actual community.
---
Which, ironically, is downright silly.
---
No, I'm good with 11 characters.
---
Did they reach it ?
---
nah its only relevant in dungeons they dont touch that
---
They're revising A Realm Reborn? Kinda of like a "Cataclysm" update but for FF 14? I was unaware.
---
I frankly enjoyed every second of what I played. Though if I had a gripe... well, two, is one that normal quests seem pointless. I was told you can just do the story ones and you'd be fine. And two, crafting is very time consuming.
---
Anet has no skill, human power and proper development process to offer enough content yearly to charge cash for it. Just look at 2019. We got 2 LW episodes, a raid and some rehashed festivals.
---
I wouldnt pay for 2019 gw2 a single penny.
---
CAT.. IM KITTY CAT.. AND I MEOW MEOW MEOW
---
Instead of ALT, try if SHIFT+F1, etc. works!
---
Don't be upset about asking questions.  That's what these threads are for!
---
1: There is no way to change the countdown timer for expiring buffs on your bar, unfortunately.
---
2: It depends on the ability and your ping.  Some abilities activate instantly when you press them, interrupting other animations your character might be in, while other abilities will "queue" in the background and activate once your character is done doing what he's doing.  The universal dodge roll is something that will interrupt any animation, so that's a good baseline to test with.  If you dodge immediately once you press the button for it, your ping is fine.  If you're getting a slight delay, that implies that you've got some connection issues and/or there are Mac issues.
---
3: You can't keep track of your cooldowns after you weapon swap away from them, or attunement swap for the Elemental.  You just need to use your memory.  That's why Elementalist and Engineer (who, with Kits, have a similarly large set of weapon skills) are some of the more complicated classes to play.
---
500💎 for each blink 👀
---
Thank you.  This “shit” sub wouldn’t be so “toxic”  if the developers actually listened to the community.  After being ignored for so long people start getting angry.  They’ve invested time and money into this product, one they care about the future for, and are basically being told, “We are not listening and do not care.  Thank you for your money.  Goodbye.”
---
Companies who make good, customer-positive decisions get positive communities.  Guess what shit, anti-consumer decisions get?
---
You're also failing to see the vast differences between both game engines. But you're so eager to jump on the band wagon and circle jerk that you fail logic entirely. All you see is "Gw 1 did this. Why the fuck hasn't GW 2?!"
---
Because, yeah, skills and templates work exactly the same as they do in GW 2. Totally. The engine hasn't changed a single bit and the game isn't coded at all differently. 
---
Why hasn't A-Net just thought about copying and pasting features from their old game to the new one?!
---
Trillions?  That seems like hyperbole.  It’s a multi-billion dollar industry and the competition is fierce.
---
The audience is definitely much larger but it’s an entirely different audience (who are incredibly fickle).
---
e. Not to mention that individual companies make far less than “trillions” even if they hit it big.  Things like fortnite are anomalies and not the norm.
---
It's more that nothing you can say is so dumb that it couldn't be meant unironically
---
My only complaint about Elementalists in general is conjured weapons. I hated conjured weapons in GW1 and I hate them in GW2. They are clunky and unintuitive, and the matter is made worse by the fact that they aren't even used for their full duration. You just spam a skil or two and drop it. Yet, the best in-slot elite skill is Fiery Greatsword while the elite spec elite skill is mostly useless outside of Condi Weaver and some niche PvP situations.
---
And anywhere where mounts are disabled. It has more uses than just skipping parts of Dungeons :P - for me at least.
---
Thanks for keeping the lights on for us all.
---
Because instead of swapping weapons they swap elements
---
Engineers can't swap between weapon sets either because they have weapon kits as utility skills
---
...and why didn't he have a human form with an armor that resembles his dragon form (Deathwing reference!)?

Not necessarily. MCs are a currency in their own right, I could just buy stuff I want with them later.
---
P.S. Or I could sell them for gold on gw2exchange over a longer period, too. In any case the tax isn't unavoidable even if you want gold.
---
If it did not change, except for vg if your mates are good, the BS will always play without EA. With power BS there are some bosses where it can be worth it but it is so horrible to play most BS keep their true rotation without EA for sanity reasons
---
Also, if you are not a good dps you will always be in the group without druid (except maybe if you have a tempest and the top dps are mirage?),you can train with or without it but make sure to be crit capped in both situation (by switching food or gear) if you are power
---
There are 2 guilds mainly active for benchmarks, SC which uses food and only the correct bonuses and LN with no food but all bonus (even class bonuses), make sure to take this into account when you compare your figures.
---
Most of the bosses are not really a dps check so as long as you understand your rotation and more importantly the mechanics of the boss you're good to go. You will grind dps with time I'd say ; just having the correct gear (exotic is OK) is a lot of the work done, don't come in tanky gear please.
---
gems for templates lol. i cant recomment this game for any new players. this game is just not fun anymore.
---
Yes! Look at that cute cape moving gently in the wind! Those physics :O :O :O !!!
---
thx for making sure it gets disabled in instances cuz of this post :3
---
Also hardly a fair comparison. ESO's quests are far more complex than normal quests in other games and is a different type of model than GW 2.
---
INB4: Achievements and collections aren't content. 
---
Dunno how many times I've been told that argument.
---
&gt; dozen pole dancers for the weekly afterwork?
---
I honestly would sign up for that.
---
And at the end, it would be for the best. Anet does it that way so you come back every now and then and check the store. Nothing new.
---
I miss looking forward to something cool... All the leaks and stuff surrounding it kept me playing even trough the biggest content droughts.
---
the problem is once you're 80 you unlock 2 elite specializations, 1 from HoT and 1 from PoF which can completely change the playstyle of any class. I'd suggest looking at  [https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle\_Wiki](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki)  and specifically the open world for different types of builds for each class and then maybe looking at the  playstyle of them on youtube so you get a better idea of what you can actually do with each class.
---
For example you might pick ranger to use a bow except alot of the times in end game they'd use a greatsword/axe etc
---
I always had only positive experiences with CS team. They gave me discounts, restored items, toons and told me they miss Tybalt too.
---
Judge a game by the # of reddit posts per day/week....
---
They each add a new mechanic to attunement swapping.
---
Tempest has Overloads.  If you stay attuned to an element for a certain amount of time without swapping, you can press that element's activation button again to use an Overload, channelling a special ability/attack that varies per element to deal big damage, big healing or other similar effects and then bonus effects once finished based on the Tempest traits you select.
---
Weaver, meanwhile, can attune to two elements at once.  Swapping an elemental attunement puts the new attunement in the off-hand 4-5 skills, and moves whatever attunement was in the off-hand into the main-hand 1-2 skills.  Skill 3 remains the same as it is normally if both attunements are the same (you can swap Fire/Fire to get all Fire skills still, they don't have to be two different elements), but if you have two different elements in your attunements then Skill 3 becomes a new skill based on the combination of those elements (and the weapon/weapons you're wielding, of course).  So you wind up with more than 20 weapon skills available based on your combination of attunements, with Skill 3 being quite variable.
---
Elite specializations generally add some complexity to every class... not always, but usually.  Firebrand is one you might take note of for Guardian, as well.  It changes the Virtues a Guardian normally has to give them passive effects when unused and small, immediate effects when used, and instead turns them into temporary kits to equip with new weapon slots having quite powerful effects, but only 5 uses of those effects before they go away and you need to wait for the Virtue's cooldown to restore before they can be used again.  So it's another case of increased complexity and more skills being at your fingertips, but in this case it's a very temporary set of skills that might take 60 or 90 seconds to recharge after you've used several of them.
---
Did you get lucky or is CS anyways this good?
---
Didn't you hear? Everyone told me the template limit of 6 had nothing to do with technical limitations and was just a marketing plan to swoop in with more slots and/or force you to buy more characters!
---
Huh. It took 9 hours for the "I'm going to conveniently ignore the fact that other games which support newer versions of directx support in their engines run smoother than games that only support older ones just because Anet says so" guy to show up. Usually takes like 5 minutes, tops. Weird.
---
Keeping the current loadout system for both gear and builds seems fine, but having account-bound *template* storage sounds great.
---
think I'm just lucky hahaha
---
GM Chip Dipper is amazing. I had a account issue a couple years ago and was trying to recover it. He responded within 24 hours and helped me out a ton. Glad to see he's still with ANet.
---
You can also use it to the ‘guard-only’ only skip to the light puzzle. Legit one of the best items in game
---
&gt; So more of a "let's make the story quicker to get through and include far less tedious fetch and talk quests."
---
Precisely. We were told not to expect it soon, but it's a big part on their list.
---
Now with the addition of templates as of Tuesday's patch, you can use those to set up a pseudo-weapon swap.  It would only work out of combat, but if you set up your main gear template to have your Dagger/Dagger and a second gear template with the same equipment in it save for Staff, you can then create keybinds for them and press them when out of combat to switch between the two sets and instantly change your weapon.  That'll save you the bother of going into your inventory.
---
But yes, as the other user has answered, Elementalists with their attunements already get access to 20 weapon skills when most classes have 10.  Letting them weapon swap mid-combat and get 40 weapon skills would be silly, both extremely complicated to play and a balance nightmare to maintain.  As they are, Elementalist has already been one of the hardest classes to balance and until the last year or two they've been on the very top end of damage-dealing capability.
---
They didn't go back on that, they outright lied. You don't change the monetization plan last minute like that.
---
Because it's common sense when you're relying entirely on the honor system.
---
Probably shit like expansion content. You gotta buy Path of Fire to get mounts, etc. 
---
Which is a ludicrous statement. Expansions are always paid content. And what's best is that Path of Fire INCLUDES Heart of Thorns for fucking free.
---
Everything else has been free if you're present when it's released but if you miss the release window, you do have to pay gems for each episode you missed. So in a sense, it's content behind a paywall. But people are also, like you said, having hate-boners for A-Net. 
---
It's almost like they completely forgot that this is a business and not a charity.
---
They might be referring to living world stuff since if you missed getting it when it was live, you gotta pay gems for it.  
---
Least that's my thoughts on it.
---
Basically Anet released their much anticipated build and equipment templates, which are limited in slots. People have been using arcDPS for years which was developed by a player with help from Anet to make it compliant with the ToS. It was buggy, crashed often and was even deleting people's gear for a minute but it had unlimited locally stored builds. Anet made a deal with the creator that basically said itll be disabled once our templates go live, which it was. This led to an uproar because it was being disabled, there isnt enough storage for some people (who have 30+ builds on one character) and is monetized, it also was crashing entire maps of people at launch.
---
Sounds cool. Yeah, if there was something that was tedious was precisely that. In fact, most of those talk quests I did didn't feel connected to a particular story in my opinion. But then again, I didn't play the full game, nor could I.
---
Fun Detected!
---
Genius. xD
---
People like to exaggerate when it comes to hate on something. There is no payed content besides xpacs and ls eps for people who missed them. 
---
Those comments mainly come as a form of "hate" towards certain aspects like build templates or skins in the gemstore.
---
Delete this. Breaking old content its a content by itself!
---
&gt; and is monetized
---
and is TRIPLE monetized, two of the monetization basically selling glorified notepads.
---
Lol since when arc was "buggy and ate equip"?
---
Change your dealer because whatever you are smoking aint good...
---
Yeah this, imagine thinking your girlfriend is crazy because she actually wants to spend time with you lmao
---
There was a third party add-on program for the game, not officially endorsed but still used by many veteran players in high-end content, which both measured your group's DPS and allowed templates of builds/gear to be saved and swapped to.  While the add-on was not officially endorsed, it was generally tolerated by Arenanet, with the caveat that if and when they created their own system for build templates that the functionality for it in this add-on be removed.  The add-on's creator agreed to that.
---
This week, build templates were officially added.  The add-on had disabled them two weeks in advance of this, as agreed.  Players who were used to the add-on have some complaints about how the official implementation handles things, including how the number of templates are limited and cash shop purchases are required to get more.  Some people had 20 or 30 templates for a single character, changing small details here and there for various raid encounters, and they're upset that they need to make such changes manually now.
---
For people who've never used that third party add-on, there are still some issues caused by the release of templates.  Of note, the auto-swapping of builds between PvP, PvE and WvW no longer happens, and the templates aren't true templates, they're loadouts, any equipment/build change that you make gets saved to whatever template you currently have equipped.  So those are issues that affect everyone.  But by and large, the biggest hue and cry being raised over this is from people who used the third party add-on and now no longer can.  If you never used that third party add-on yourself, then most of those complaints don't apply to you.
---
Players wanted build templates since the start of the game. Years later Anet allows players to create addons. The players create their own build templates addon. A few years after that Anet releases official build templates and bans the fans' one. But Anet's version isn't as good as the fans' for many players. Moreover, Anet split their system into 3 parts and charges a hefty amount for each part.
---
TLDR; People who wanted build template aren't satisfied and feel they're being squeezed for money.
---
And some people refuse to see reality for what it is and continue to pay for sub par garbage. We all have our vices, I guess.
---
Like always: ban post during the weekend when Anet can't reply. Leddit loses its shit, then comes Monday it's somebody job yet again to probe OP is full of shit. Never change guys.
---
yes, any kind of group leader
---
Is there such a statistic available?
---
Now if they make it so that instances can be done as a party, I might have to give it another try...
---
No limitation there: free accounts can buy individual character slots from the gem store. As far as I can tell, everything in the Upgrades tab of the gem store is purchasable on a free account.
---
This is long. Sorry in advance. This is a slightly modified copy of a post I made in another thread which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dpy3zg/its_almost_amazing_how_this_all_backfired/f5zxv6u
---
Mike Z said that templates were coming soon(TM) during the announcement event that announced very little of value, or very few things we didn't already know. During the announcement, nothing was said about how templates would work. 
---
Then, about 3-4 weeks ago, we got a blog post about Templates: when they were coming; how they were going to work; and that they would be monetised. 
---
The main problems are: 
---
* The templates aren't templates, they're loadouts. You "save" a template, but any changes you make to it are automatically saved. So you can't, for instance, save a generic Condi mirage which you use for 90% of the time, but if you tweak a few traits to use a variation those tweaks overwrite the template. This is annoying, and very explicitly, is NOT a templating system. 
---
* The system itself is a bit clunky, and divided into three aspects: **equipment template** (for weapons, armour, runes, sigils, trinkets etc...); **character build templates** (for traits and utilities); and **account-wide build storage**, for storing builds accessible across your account. 
---
* When you load a template from your build storage, it overwrites your current loadout. Again, these are not conventional templates which are saved for all time and only updated when you deliberately save to overwrite.
---
* Equipment templates save equipment in a brand new "armoury," freeing up normal inventory space. For those who need the extra space this is kind of cool. For 7 years though, people have worked around the inventory wars aspect so this is partially redundant.  And for those with legendary equipment, this inventory space is literally useless; there is now no disadvantage in terms of inventory space to just crafting another set of ascended armour and weapons for a fraction of the cost of legendary armour. 
---
* There are hard limits on the number of templates available to any character: 6 each of the character-bound build and equipment templates, and 24 account build storage. For those who engage in a lot of endgame - either competitive WvW, PvP, PvE, or any combination - 6 builds is not enough. Personally, I have more than 6 builds on my mesmer, so this update is wholly inadequate for saving the builds I regularly use for raids. 
---
* Each character starts off with 2 equipment and 3 build templates unlocked. Further equipment and build templates cost gems. Except for the account storage, unlocks are **character** bound, not account bound. To unlock 1 each of equipment and build slots costs 800 gems, the same as a whole new character slot which comes with 2 equipment and 3 build templates as standard. 
---
* I think most people grudgingly accept that if equipment templates come with free/additional equipment storage that there should be a cost for the convenience. However, those with legendary equipment, particularly legendary armour, the extra storage is next to useless, and a paid feature which is not fully used. 
---
* There is no justifiable reason why both the build template and build storage should cost gems. These do not "store" items and so do not have the same justification as equipment templates freeing up inventory space. This triple dipping on monetisation for this system is pretty gross, double gross when one considers that it doesn't actually function properly. 
---
(NB. Builds have links and can be shared. They can also be loaded from links. So provided you are willing to use an overlay or alt-tab, you can copy/paste build links. This cost is therefore redundant and a massive, massive cash grab.)
---
* The WvW and PvP specific builds have gone. Everyone uses the same build templating system. As a consequence, the "free" build slots are not actually free, but just replacing the single WvW and PvP ones lost in this update. People have joined PvP and WvW expecting their previous, specific builds to be equipped, and they aren't. They are inadvertantly running around with a PvE build in these competitive game modes, much to the annoyance of *everyone* in those modes. 
---
* Currently, it seems as though under certain conditions, switching builds using the build templates crashes an entire map instances. Fractals and open world maps seem to be hardest hit by this. (NB. I'm a little skeptical of some of the reports around this, but there are some reports from those in fractals where the crash is apparently repeatable.) 
---
* When compared to the free build template system released using the third party tool ArcDPS, the official native templating system is a MASSIVE step backwards. 
---
So that's everything off the top of my head. There may be other things I've temporarily forgotten about, but overall, this has been received very badly in a number of technical and financial fronts. The triple monetisation is a really gross money grab.  The templates themselves just don't really work. And the very hard caps on the number of templating slots is really inadequate for dedicated, hardcore endgame players. 
---
This has been a total dumpster fire, but it looks as though EAnet are hunkering down in a bunker mentality. In an explanatory post last week Stephane lo Presti said that "we have listened to your feedback" but then proceeded to explain again what we already knew (although slightly more clearly) and made no comment on ANY of the significant and vocal concerns the community had. They've pushed ahead with the build template system and made no mention of the feedback, or made changes to the system on the basis of feedback.
---
Don't delete your old character(s), the saved birthday gifts have some goodies for you.  If you want to make a new character, do it on a new slot it at all possible.
---
Any character class can do open world solo content.  Some are easier than others (Ranger and Necromancer come to mind), but all are capable of it, and all do it in their own way.  If you have the character slots to spare, you should create several and try them out, either using your max level boost (using it sends your character to the Silverwastes zone to play around in at max level, and you can cancel the boost to avoid fully using it and try it on a different character instead), or by going into the PvP lobby to practice on training dummies/NPCs there without actually playing PvP games.
---
The PvP lobby might be the better choice in the end because it'll let you test out Elite Specializations for whatever expansions you own as well, which the level 80 boost in the Silverwastes won't let you do.
---
As for end game content, this is probably what chased you away last time.  Guild Wars 2 isn't a game with an extensive gear treadmill to keep you grinding.  You'll have story to complete and all that, but you need to set your own goals beyond that.  Look through the game's Wardrobe at any bank to find skins that you like, then type /wiki itemname to find out where it comes from.  Some might be easy to obtain, some might not be, but you can set your own goals that way to build the character look you like.  Fashion Wars 2 is the true end-game.  Well, there's fractals, raids and other such things, but you say you want solo world content, so you can feel free to focus on that.
---
Would like to add people really, really wanted to get build templates for years AND they said they absolutely would PAY tons of $$$ for them, so technically they got what they wanted. Expensive build templates.
---
Next step, uninstall /s
---
Sorry I couldn't resist.
---
But, yeah, that is the next step.
---
Thank you for your input. 
---
Power chrono here ^^’
---
I have ascended weapons, trinkets, backpack, starting to work on other gear... 
---
So 80% is decent?
---
nothing that dude talks about arc is correct. there isnt a single case where arc templates ever ate gear. one dude claimed it did but he later revealed he was drunk or something like that and deleted his gear accidentally..
---
also arc only crashed when a new build arrived but even with that it got much more stable
---
Well I've tried deleting and downloading a new exe, nothing. deleted the %appdata% folders, nothing. It's not letting me start more than one game instance. Tried on my other computer and it's working fine there, can launch as many game instances as I want.
---
I didnt even comment on the state of the game, but thanks for proving my point i guess...
---
You should censor your furry guild message. That's actually disgusting.
---
yes.
---
Of the two specs, Holosmith is in a better spot right now for most gameplay.  It adds melee mechanics to the Engineer, something they previously only really enjoyed via the Toolkit utility skill.  Both the Sword weapon and the Photon Forge elite specialization mechanic bring the Holosmith up close and personal with enemies.  The Photon Forge serves as a pseudo-kit that locks other kits out for 5 seconds after use, but offers powerful weapon skills on pretty low cooldowns considering what they do... but it also has the Heat mechanic.  The longer you have the Photon Forge active and the more of its skills you use, the more Heat builds up.  If you exceed your maximum amount of Heat, the Photon Forge overheats, inflicting heavy damage on you, and locking you out of both the Photon Forge and your Toolbelt skills for a short duration of time.  When you turn the Photon Forge off, Heat depletes.  Many of your skills become stronger at higher Heat levels, so you want to juggle your Photon Forge use to come close to overheating without actually doing so.
---
Scrapper isn't as strong in general PvE, though it certainly has its place in PvP/WvW.  It's a defensive minded specialization.  The Hammer it carries also lets Engineers melee, but its attacks are more focused on crowd control than damage.  Scrapper has various mechanics to reduce damage, clear conditions, stack boons and otherwise play defensively, but defensive play generally isn't as valuable in PvE as offensive play is, so Scrapper isn't as popular there.
---
Go for Holosmith first, if solo PvE is your focus.  You'll eventually get enough Hero Points for both, but Holosmith will give you a sizable upgrade to work with in PvE.
---
&gt;Look at the mount adoption license. When it first released, it was fully RNG only, and there's never been a selectable version of that because of the people who already bought the item in the first place.
---
That's kind of a bad example, because they replaced it the current mount adoption licenses, which have a mount select version.
---
Anet could always release bundles to max out a character at a much reduced price for the build templates, and/or take away the cap.
---
I never said that
---
You hear voices?
---
Not only that, but what if someone bought it from RMT and then sold it on the auction house for 10k? Does the person who bought it through legitimate means also get it removed and their account banned? 
---
The history of an item shouldn't affect the current owner.
---
What if everyone at NCSoft West is so mentally deranged that running around in a poncho is considered normal work attire ?
---
Dude you will get banned in the first one.  Otherwise what you are claiming is that I could buy gold and have them send it to *me* because from Anets side of things that looks the same as if I had them send it elsewhere.   Those situations are no different.  Except in that second scenario an innocent can very likely be on the receiving end and still get banned.
---
If you have the inventory space and the patience, open it all.  Salvage what you get after you open it.
---
If you salvage the gear while it's still unidentified, you're just salvaging it as whatever rarity it is while unidentified.  Opening unidentified gear, though, has a chance of giving you gear that's above that rarity.  Your blue can become a green, your green can become a yellow... your blue can even become an exotic, very rarely.
---
The build templates for traits and skills shouldn't even be purchasable. All 6 character build slots and all 24 account build slots should be free.
---
Each of these carries so little information that it's utterly bonkers they're charging for them, and I'm astounded people are wanting compromises on those rather than a total unlock.
---
Charge for the equipment loadouts only.
---
You seemed to suggest that not buying into the microtransaction thing wasn't good for the company, which is true, but not the customers' problem.
---
I could literally finish living world episodes for you without having my monitor turned on, they are so braindead easy
---
yes sorry arenanet was soo busy with gemstore that forgot about dx10,11,12
---
It's a hell of a lot less of a pain than navigating through several panels in the hero menu (which stalls somewhat on weaker connections because of how much shit goes into the hero panel now).
---
For me, Shift + F1-F5 are my novelties.
---
For the "templates", I just use the numberpad since I won't need to use them on the fly and won't be buying any extra slots without them going account bound in gemstore purchases.
---
What the hell is that guild message o.o
---
We all know they _should_ be free but... It's aNet we're talking about ahahah
---
If some of it can be free (and in greater amount) and a"scaling" with what you own I'd be happ_ier_
---
Gear slots should 100% account wide too
---
If the build templates actually worked properly, then people may in time overlook the cost. 
---
If the costs were such that you unlocked slots across your account, the high costs could be justified. 
---
If a good templating system were introduced as standalone, one-off cost paid feature, people may complain but would probably overlook it, as it's just a one-off cost and it's done. 
---
Right now, we have a system which is illogical, highly restrictive, character-bound, and exceptionally expensive. I believe I saw someone do a quick calculation where at the current gold-to-gem conversion rate, fully unlocking all slots on a character costs over 1k gold. Do you need all slots? Depends. On my mesmer I have at least 6 distinct builds, all very different from each other (so not including small trait changes). For my mesmer therefore, I'd need all of them. Similar for firebrand and revenant. So I would need over 3k gold to unlock enough template slots for those three characters alone. 
---
We have the absolute worst combination of functionality and monetisation. Altogether, that's why this is such a fiasco.
---
Wouldn't you want up to 80 abilities? That sounds like a clusterf*ck I'd love to participate in. We have 5 abilities per element attunement, with 4 elements that's 20 abilities right off the bat. Then you swap weapons for another 5 abilities per element attunement, with 4 of the same elements that's another 20 abilities. Then you do the same with underwater combat and BAM you easily have 80 abilities. And that's just core Elementalists.
---
Why am I like this ( .__.)
---
Well, in GW2 most of "actual content" is an open world. Sure, the game also has fractals, raids and PvP, but if you're indeed "a filthy casual", you can disregard it for now and just keep exploring that big world (and doing personal / expansions stories), leveling alts and whatever floats your boat.
---
Every profession (class) can solo open world content without problems, choose what looks more fancy to you, and you'll be Ok. 
---
Since you're not completely new, it probably makes sense to do the first episodes of HoT and PoF for basic gliding and first mount, it adds a lot of fun (without making exploration completely trivial), and then... just play the game and have fun?
---
Equipment and skills can't be tied now due to build being used in all 3 gamemode, while equipment is used in only 2. Removing gear storage would be required for templates, and is not realistic dev option when it already exist.
---
&gt;as is the case on all items that have a cost of more than a few hundred gold.
---
Wait.  You think pointless gold sink cosmetic items like legendary items should be less than a 1k?  my god, your on some other shit here bud.
---
That makes sense. I like to do them in reverse order of level, except sometimes Orr last, because it has no hearts. My ranger finished at Melandru's temple.
---
There’s still a ton of content to play, especially for someone that’s been gone so long. Your pessimism is as bad for the game as build templates...
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
There's got to be a way they can disable this. In EVE online, Alt+F4 is a default hotkey for an ability, so you can't exit out of the game with that shortcut. It's not like Windows is necessarily what's forcing the programs to close.
---
This is a pretty weak argument.  You don't need or have to buy anything from the gemstore, ever, so what's the point?
---

Missed the shot of Braham, but thanks!
---
You also get a shot at salvaging sigils and runes into symbols, which can be valuable. You don't get that with unidentified versions. If you don't have the inventory space, make sure to at least open rare unidentified gear because it has a chance to be a rare exotic skin which can sometimes be worth a fair amount of gold.

That's true for your Ranger character as well, of course, so while it's fine to stick with your Engineer for now, don't write off the Ranger.  You'll want to get some better gear for that character (level boost gear is typically defensively-oriented, which is subpar for PvE), but once you've done that you can go and work towards the Soulbeast specialization for him, a better specialization for solo PvE.
---
But there's no rush on that.  The character won't be going anywhere, so you can stick with your Engineer for now.  The Photon Forge awaits!
---
On another note, by taking a character of any level into the PvP lobby, you'll be brought to max level there and have access to all specializations, even elite ones.  While you can go and play actual PvP games with those specializations to test them out, you don't have to, you can instead stay in the lobby where there are both training dummies and various NPCs to practice on and test things out.  If you're looking to actually take Scrapper and Holosmith for test runs before you spend Hero Points on them in PvE, or if you're curious about other classes and how they play, the PvP lobby might be just what you're looking for.
---
It’s always so refreshing when I get to Orr. Once the hearts are done, it feels like you’ve already finished, and the last few maps are basically your victory lap.
---
Honestly, I'm only like just over a week into GW2 but ever since starting with core Elementalist to learn the absolute fundamentals of the game such as quests, currencies, UI and most importantly, game tempo, every time I tried out a new class on the side, the limit of 10 abilities is just so dull and boring to me. Like sure there's still other abilities like signets and whatnot, but in terms of the main *abilities*, having 10 is just nothing to me now. I mean honestly, especially coming from a LoL background, I personally wouldn't count the first ability as an ability and more of an *autoattack*/basic attack. As such, most classes only have 8 base abilities and core Elementalist has 16 base abilities, just with 4 different forms of basic attacks. Sure, most champions in LoL only have 3 base abilities and one ultimate, but the fact that GW2 is for the most part not PvP (or at least what I'll play for 95% of my time on GW2) allows for waaaay more ability usage and fun.
---
Here's my timeline over the past 10 or so days.
---
First, I start with core Elementalist and sticking with a staff, I got pummeled wherever I went and as such had to stick to kiting and casting for the most part. While getting used to it I learnt what hearts are, what scouts are, what vistas are, what waypoints are, what the absolute most basic of basics are.
---
Then I moved to ranger to try dive deeper into combat tempo, and honestly, going from core Elementalist, where you need to micromanage everything such as your positioning, your elemental attunements for whatever situation you're in etc, ranger (w/ longbow) easily came off as almost cheating. You don't need to worry about damage because if you need damage, you just rapid fire. You still need damage? Use your AoE. You're in danger? No you're not, your pet draws all the aggro from you anyway. You somehow still in danger? You have invisibility and a knockback interrupt, all instant avenues of safety. That's why at least for the way I see it, you're virtually unkillable as long as you give some effort.
---
But the point is, you need far less effort to cover 80% of what you need to do in leveling from 0 to 80. As an elementalist, you need to have far more things in mind as well as put more effort into being effective since there's nothing else to tank for you, meaning your positioning is vital. You also have the same amount of tankiness as wet tissue paper and you basically have no mobility (or so I thought at the time).
---
Anyway, my last 2 days I've been grinding out a new elementalist because only two days ago did I actually give the dual daggers build a try and honestly, I wish I hadn't been so stubborn to stick with a staff since the abilities from dual daggers essentially solved all my issues with the elementalist I had before. Now I know a lot more about what I'm doing, now that I understand the game tempo a lot more, I'm finally able to execute upon the mobile mage caster playstyle. I also like not having too much direct survivability since that keeps me on my toes during combat (I just don't find playing unkillable juggernauts fun cuz there's no \[or significantly less\] element of risk and thus less effort is needed). Now when I find myself in a specific situation, I can always find myself doing more things at once and thus having more fun than if I were to just AoE heal as Necromancer or stand back in safety as a Ranger with a longbow just mindlessly basic attacking things to death from afar.
---
That being said, I still have a metric asston to learn which is why you may have seen me being super active on these question threads. I don't think I've had this much fun in any game in a long time. GW2 is quite literally the game I always knew I wanted but never found until now.
---
You can recreate their setup in a buildeditor to get the stats. Then try to evaluate the effective power of that setup. Also evaluate the effective power for your setup. Divide the effective power of your setup by the effective power of their setup to get a value that should lie between 0 and 1. Multiply their average dps for the build with that number. Thats the number that you should strive for to get some kind of feedback on how good your rotation is already.
---
Formula for effective Power:  
---
Effective Power = Power * (1-critchance) + Power*critchance*critmultiplier
---
It won't be perfect, but it is a somewhat good assumption.
---
You will still want to configure boons and profession buffs as given on the site.
---
For a condition build its harder to make a guess since different conditions may have different increased duration. Condition builds also have some power scaling which makes a guess even harder.
---
[Here you go!](https://imgur.com/N1IQbeV)
---
I dunno. I gave up trying to understand people a long time ago.
---
This looks pretty cool
---
It's not about me wanting stuff, but professions giving a somewhat even number of mechanics. And even then, Elementalists have MORE weapon skills than other professions.
---
Oooooh yeah.
---
Today. Maxed out templates.
---
They deserve it!
---
They were fools to grant us such power
---
Looks like we are going to Brahams guild.
---
Remember leather and mystic coins?  Some bubble that didn't burst until all gen 2 legendaries finally released.
---
This might make an interesting taco marker pack.
---
Two interesting notes about that concept art:
---
1. Vigil Flag on the ground. So the Vigil outpost we kept hearing about in Bound by Blood (or a patrol party) gets wiped out.
---
2. Braham's in his original gear, not his S3-and-on outfit.
---
Well, that's the first target of getting back on track reached. The question, now, is if they can keep up the momentum going forward.
---
Oh, I’m *definitely* going to go do that later today, then. That’s a pretty damn convenient feature for someone in my position. Where can I find the PvP lobby? 
---
And now that you mention gear, let me ask: what stats should I go for on gear? Since I noticed pretty early on that the Engineer seems to dish out condition damage a *lot*, I’ve gravitated to that stat when choosing gear, but I’m not sure what else would be ideal. Any advice in this area?
---
Done this about 9 months ago. Now a happy but very very light FF14 player (just finished Shadowbringers and that expansion got all its praise for damn good reasons 🤩) and also finally playing more single-player games again. Finished a whole bunch of stuff.
---
Don't get me wrong, especially for how little money they are asking, GW2 have me a phenomenal 4700 hours of game time. But it's done. Beat the boss. Saw the ending. Time for another game. Especially with how few promising open ends of the release version like WvW, class design or pet battles ever got fleshed out.
---
I'm so happy I can play 2 hours more after 2 months.
---
Is this tonic usable in fractals? I guess you could do the uncategorized and underground facility skips with it if it is?
---
That's an interesting idea.
---
I'm coming back after many years.
---
I'm a pretty casual player anyway. But I'm broke, so broke. I've got a couple hundred mystic coins in the bank though. Am I better off selling them so I can gear up or are they super important?
---
edit: Also, am I better off using or selling these treat bags?
---
There could be another meaning though. With the loss of his bow, after his failure to kill Jormag, Braham may decide to "go back to his roots" with his gear.
---
That’s clever buddy 5head
---
shhhhhh
---
What momentum?
---
24th aug for AU$100, bought gems for blc. it might be a long time before i do that again. i havent done overtime at work in a while and i havent had any spare cash. besides nothing has interested me in the gem store lately that i cant just gold&gt;gem convert for. i recently bought both extra life packages from gold&gt;gems
---
\begin{tinfoilhat}
---
I believe that the speed and quality of customer support is positively correlated with how much real money you've spent on the game.
---
Even during that one period where the wait time was supposedly weeks or sometimes more than a month, my ticket turnaround time has always been within 24 hours, so I somehow got moved to the front of the queue for a relatively unimportant issue that other people had to wait for.
---
The only thing that really sets me apart from other players is that I have purchased almost one million gems with real money, so my account is probably flagged for "premium" support service.
---
\end{tinfoilhat}
---
Their goal was to have a new episode every other month, with festivals and other events in the off months. So something new/returning every month.
---
August - Four Winds
---
September - Prologue
---
October - Mad King Festival
---
November - Ep. 1
---
December - Wintersday
---
its funyn that the video is called content at its peak. this is exactly what ppl did in ffxiv 2.1 before they fixed the out of bounds glitches. the official player blogs were full of ppl taking pictures in impossible places. best content ff14 had ina looong time.
---
I wish they could implement something like this into the game, using ai to calculate the physics  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atcKO15YVD8  
---
They could not just use this for capes, but for a ton of stuff.
---
Unless youre primarily playing pve. There’s plenty of open world goals to achieve even for veterans.
---
No new classes since Heart of Thorns, but Path of Fire gives a new elite specialization for each class, as well as mounts via masteries there.  That might be of interest to you.  There's a few places in the game where you can 'rent' mounts, including in the Mad King's Raceway in the current Halloween content, so you can test some of them out before you buy the expansion.  Of note, the Roller Beetle mount you can rent in various places also requires a Living World episode in addition to Path of Fire to get permanently (LW4 Ep 3).
---
There's been plenty of other changes that are too lengthy to mention, so review your traits and such before you play, as many of them will have changed.
---
To be honest I only take the in game community seriously anymore. Just ignore these comments. Its just a tiny minority of people trying to bring down the community to their level.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
&gt; calls others sensitive
---
&gt; edits post being overly dramatic and sensitive
---
[mfw](https://giphy.com/gifs/latelateshow-t6WvtUluR8V2NSxLlk)

For real though, your first post was fine.  Who cares about worthless internet points?  It’s the edit where you look hysterical, like yelling: [I’m not being sensitive!  Everyone else is too sensitive!  Everyone else is wrong!](https://i.imgur.com/Fn7QcPE_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)

Humor is always subjective.  If you don’t want others’ opinions to your opinion I would suggest not posting online.  Or at least find a safe space where everyone agrees with you.
---
EDIT: NOW GO AHEAD AND DOWNVOTE ME TO PROVE ME RIGHT!  EVERY DOWNVOTE AMASSES MORE POWER TO ME!  I WILL RESURRECT ZHAITAN WITH MY NEWFOUND POWERS.
---
A *million* gems? Wha-- What did you even spend all those gems on?
---
They wouldn't if they hadn't locked it in. If they came out on the 30th and said with Icebrood Saga we are giving you elite specs and they will release in episode 2 (this is just an example). Then episode 2 is revealed and elite specs aren't revealed oh god help Anet. I think they were smart not to reveal it if its not locked down because this community is full of people who will just complain. For what its worth I do think Icebrood is going to release new elite specs and team 4 is working on them.
---
If THAT'S what you heard, then you're not only wrong, you're stupid.
---
Snowcrows.com has the meta builds, benchmarks (aim for 80%) and links to discord for raid training.
---
This is releasing 2 months after the prologue.
---
stop ur assomptions .. u guys r literally the worst
---
&gt; They're finally there now, but I think people are looking for a BIG drop to come back right now.
---
It depends which people. 
---
If Anet manages a festival, an LS episode or other system/content updates every month, its a great product for new players because for them, there is no shortage of content for the first year at least. 
---
But then replayability of festival content starts thinning out the following years and the people to complain that they only get anything worth playing 6 months of the year, then 3 months of the year and so on.
---
Its just natural that those players are looking for a big content drop to keep occupied.
---
But we all know that wont come for at least 2 years until season 5 is over. And even they now have enough annual festivals ( i dont think they will add another next year), some of the existing ones still need another do-over until they can basically run on auto-mode every year and Anet can focus on something else instead.
---
ditto
---
Thanks to everyone who participated in the stream for a good cause. I've collected what little info we have so far on the wiki page for [Whisper in the Dark](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Whisper_in_the_Dark), so now folks can edit in more information as time passes. :)
---
Kids and their phones these days ... having no clue about computers!
---
I can just see the map chat spam now.
---
Since this game has started I was ready to just blindly buy the equivalent of a monthly subscription in gems and figure out what to do with them later if they just did not fuck anything up in the previous 3 months. I never actually got a chance to do that.
---
there are plenty of guides out there, it isn't that hard to google it. Your best bet are training groups (u can google that too) but even then you're expected to know the basic mechanics of encounters and how your class plays out in a raid scenario.
---
gw2efficiency
---
look at that setu.OHMYGODADEADBODY.
---
Thanks for the image! I should've checked reddit before uploading my twitch screenshot of it on the wiki, but I've rectified it now with the image you've provided. It sure benefits us all that Efram is bringing the Flame Legion splinter group to the fold as an ally so we can use the fine services of the Flame Legion's best cartographer from the shaman caste. :)
---
The programmers, writers, and artists probably want to get paid too, and the $60 you paid for actually buying the game plus whatever expansions you bought only goes so far.  I know we all like the idea of a game where you only pay money for fancy skins in three green store is nice, but if the community doesn't butt enough of those to cover the costs of all the continuous content, they will need to do something.
---
Your number of players section needs more options or allowing text.
---
There are significant activity differences in raid days and non raid days, and in number of people online in an average day of different mmo's.
---
I have guilds in multiple MMO's, and those numbers are significanrtly different, but there is no way to represent that.
---
I bought the black lion garden plots after the cooking update. Before that I bought Living World Season 3. Before that I bought HoT + PoF. That's all I can remember.
---
Sure, just like shared inventory slots.
---
"Guys it's just 5 slots, 700 gems each or 2800 if you buy all of them"
---
Except then they increased the limit to.. 20? Or is it more now? So it's not 2800 gems any more, it's 11200, or $140. 
---
I can almost guarantee the same will happen to build templates.
---
Below 70 is not knowing the rotation at all. Being 80% for easy rotations like soulbeast Condi or daredevil power is not really great. But for some other rotations (like power chrono which is quite intense during the burst) you want to have a solid opener (I think you need to hit 53k a peak? Anyway check the first 25%, most of your dps is there.
---
With a golem you have perma quickness/alacrity, so what you can do on a non-moving target at 00:00 timer is different from a real boss where boons are not there the first second. So if you can handle doing the opener with 1 clone, great, but if you can handle it 8/10 or even 10/10, I would rather do the safe 2 clones opener as you will lose less damage than the damage you would lose by failing the 1clone opener (I'm not to date with the latest updates, but here is the idea: in real situation, nothing will happen as expected except when grinding a timer with a speedclear guild. So learn your opener and the rotation and make sure that when a mechanic pops, after handling it you know what to do in your rotation
---
I quite like this pattern :)
---
Imagine taking this clip seriously.
---
I think it might be both. I mean 24 hours would cause anyone to do this.
---
Don't set yourself up for disappointment.
---
There's nothing to support this. It's fine with being hopeful for the future of the game, but if you start banking on unannounced things, you'll only end up resentful when they don't happen.
---
&gt; Otherwise what you are claiming is that I could buy gold and have them send it to me because from Anets side of things that looks the same as if I had them send it elsewhere.
---
You could! [Anet very clearly states several times here that you will not be banned or suspended for simply receiving](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/730479/#Comment_730479). The moment you start doing suspicious stuff with it, you might get banned. I don't know what else to add.
---
Ah, right. My bad. I assumed it was okay to talk about the clip linked in the comment I've answered to. Didn't notice that this is the "name &amp; date only" part of the thread.
---
Rubi's great
---
If I bought the game for the first time today and logged in only to realize that all the living world content is locked behind gems I would be fuckin pissed. That is so much content and pretty much their entire focus and you have to pay for it again after already paying. It makes the box price of the game completely misleading.
---
Do dumb comments deserve serious replies?
---
Wouldn't they have cut before that?
---
Speak for yourself pal.
---
Lemme see... I have:
---
* 32 gemstore glider skins
---
* 91 gemstore mount skins
---
* All gemstore home instance upgrades
---
* 64 gemstore outfits
---
* 43 unlimited gathering tools
---
* 25 gemstore novelties
---
* 24 shared slots
---
* 17 bank tabs
---
* 18 character slots
---
* 8 bag slots on 9 characters
---
* Most gemstore armor sets and pieces
---
* About half of all gemstore weapons
---
This plus a few odds and ends here and there accounts for about 400,000 gems. The rest of it went to gold, transmutation stones/charges, gold, total makeover kits, gold, name change contracts, gold, BL keys, gold...
---
Then trailer on Nov 12th
---
at the end of the livestream, she just dropped the floor. For fun as she was nackered. Thats all :)
---
Except you can now use them without them being tied to a game mode. (Eg. now I have a labyrinth mass tagger build and my usual pve build a quick away.)
---
Yea, Elsweyr was a disappointment for me with the small map, but still, i bought it and play it. I wouldn't mind a smaller expansion for gw2, maybe not full price, but adds more than living story episode.
---
Counterpoint: while opening blue/green unidentified boxes is (practically) always a gain, with rare boxes it's a gamble - yes, you have a chance to get something valuable, but it's more likely to get a random rare worth less then the box, so it **may** be better just to sell them on TP.
---
I was in PvP once and I joked that there was a glitch where if you press ALT+ Pet Swap (there was a ranger in our team and in the enemy team) there was a bug where you'd get your cooldowns reset
---
2 players suddenly DC'd ahahaha
---
Im not?   
---
I literally never stated who I was talking about or adressed any specific group or person. 
---
People just feel attacked if they see behaviour criticized they see in themselves. "Methinks thou dost protest too much".  
---
And judging by the silent downvotes, thats a lot of people by now for a vague statement that didnt target anyone.
---
NOT GOING TO REZ YOU IF YOU'RE FULL DEAD
---
STOP SCALING THE BOSS
---
My first character, my charr necromancer, finished with a heart next to where new charr start that I somehow missed. It was the biggest anticlimax ever.
---
Yeah, about 2000 hrs if playtime. Items like that can and should exist. Items like eternity are end-game. Chak infusions and stuff like that is post end-game. It’s a very easy concept. You can’t make an MMO without *something* that simply can’t be readily achieved. You need items that players can say “wow I’ll never own that,” and then when they get their eternity or whatever they say “that’s what I’m working towards next.”
---
clip: [https://clips.twitch.tv/FuriousDeterminedHumanYouDontSay](https://clips.twitch.tv/FuriousDeterminedHumanYouDontSay)
---
My post will be pertaining to PvE.
---
**Holosmith**: A sword&amp;shield DPS spec that uses lasers to cut enemies. Can activate a "Holoforge" transformation and build up heat as they attack. If they cap the heat threshold, they explode and take a lot of damage. However, your abilities gets stronger the closer you are to the heat threshold. In theory it is a high-risk-high-reward class that packs a lot of damage and CC. Also, their elite skill allows them to fire a kamehameha. **Also, they get a light saber!!!**
---
Holosmith is used as a high-mid dps in raids. It's known for being either very easy to play for middle dps, and hard to play for high dps. It also brings along high CC potential. Because of this, Holosmith is often very well liked and welcome into raids.
---
It's worth noting that Holosmith is the canonical class of the Pact Commander featured in GW2 story trailers since 2017. 
---
**Scrapper**: A hammer-wielding bulky bruiser that gains barrier as it damages its foes. It has Gyros that surround the Scrapper with pulsing supportive effects such as heals, protection, and stealth. The more damage it deals, the more bulky it becomes. Using its profession mechanic, Function Gyro, it can resurrect allies or stomp(pvp) foes from a distance. 
---
Scrapper is not currently in the meta for any PvE group content. So you won't see it much in fractals/raids. However, its survivability and skill set make it ideal for open world and solo play, since it easily stacks buffs on itself that make it a one man army. It also has uses in PvP and WvW, particularly the latter where it serves the role of a healer who can convert conditions on allies into boons.
---
**Extra Comments**:  The core engineer gets access to a variety of skills that make it ideal for farming. Flamethrower allows you to tag many enemies at once, while Turrets can help grab the attention of small fries. Rocket Boots extend your mobility by a ludicrous amount, allows you to escape from almost any battle.
---
**Conclusion**: Holo is well loved for group content. Scrapper for solo play.
---
Engineer is one of my most favorite classes in the game. I hope you consider it.
---
To add to 2nd answer: there are no known issues with skill delays on Mac, so it's likely just an effect of skill queueing - a lot of skills do not interrupt auto-attack, so they have to wait for current attack completed.
---
WP CONTESTED WTF?!
---
When I played WoW, I did 2v2 arenas with a shaman buddy. He had his healing spells set on f1-f5, and could press Alt to make it self cast. Every other match ended with him closing his game and leaving me to die.
---
When you die but your team's still fighting
---
Only bought for content, so that is HoT and PoF.  Then another 800 gems for a char slot so I have one of each class to play with, again content worth paying for. The next time real money is spent will be if there is an expension/elite specs, in other word(s) never.
---
It's comical how large skill templates are. Not that I'm complaining.
---
They actually said that elite specs were possible to get released with these episodes:
---
&gt; **Early messaging around the Icebrood Saga mentioned “expansion-tier features.” What do you see as those features?**
---
&gt; [...] Things that we wouldn’t rule out – but that we’re not talking about today – would be like another mount, *another elite specialisation*, those types of things. [...]
---
^Source: ^https://www.pcgamesn.com/guild-wars-2/pvp-raids-world-restructuring
---
I wouldn't go as far as comparing EAnet to Blizzard. Sure they've both been fucking up for years, and yes, original minds behind their biggest franchises have left, and I can agree that they've become the greedy and soulless corporations, but Blizzard fucks up monumentally, while EAnet will disappoint you even with their fuckups.
---
Whatever you do, don't blink!
---
Read again what you quote. They never said they are possible, they said they are not ruled out. In their language it means they are not even working on them currently.
---
&gt;I wouldn't go as far as comparing EAnet to Blizzard.
---
And yet you make an exaggerated nickname comparing ArenaNet to EA (who are arguably *worse* than Blizzard).
---
Bought PoF for $15, and since then ANet haven't given me any incentive to invest in their game a single penny more.
---
That's why I don't get why they chose to do another crappy living world season instead of expansion. By now we would be heading towards 3rd expac where players would drop $30-$60 for it ON TOP of gem store purchases. And what does Living world generate? Nothing by itself.
---
If Anet has truly found a way to release updates more frequently then I don't personally see the need for an expansion.  So far it looks like we may end up getting story content updates every two months.  Now how large they will be is still up in the air but we'll get a general idea in a few weeks.
---
*Don't blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back. Don't look away. And don't blink. Good Luck.*
---
With Wintersday in Dec, my guess is that it will be more like:
---
* January - Ep. 2
---
* February - Lunar New Year (I think this starts here anyway)
---
* March - Ep. 3
---
* Apr - SAB
---
* May - Ep. 4
---
* June - Dragon Bash(?)
---
* July - Ep. 5
---
* Aug - Four Winds
---
* Sept - Ep. 6
---
* Oct - Mad King
---
* Nov - ?
---
* Dec - Wintersday
---
These are for "content" patches. Not other things like Feature/Bug/Balance/QoL patches
---
I didn't downvote you. But it's probably cause people keep saying it with no evidence to back it up. If people keep saying it, then people will start to believe it's confirmed. Then when it doesn't happen, all these people get mad at Anet for not adding in something they never said they where adding in to begin with.
---
It's best to keep expectations in line with what they have actually announced. This community is really good at setting themselves up for disappointment, and then blaming Anet for not delivering something they never said they where going to.
---
Yeah, one time I tried to map my keys like that in World of Warcraft.  Alt-F1, Alt-F2, Alt-F3, Alt-F4, crash to desktop.
---
Do'h.
---
So I wait for WoW to start and reconnect and start doing all of my mappings again.  Ctrl-F1, Ctrl-F2, etc, Alt-F1, Alt-F2, Alt-F3, Alt-F4, crash to desktop.
---
WTF
---
So I start again.  Same thing happens.  It took me literally three times through that process to figure out what was happening.
---
We don't know anything about Asgeir, so they could make up whatever thing they want. Norn don't bury their dead, so I'd bet he died peacefully in Hoelbrak, watching over the lodge.
---
If we ever get new elite specializations, he's probably going to be represented in some way, either as the new revenant legend or as an overall theme for another profession.
---
Which is why it's hidden under spoiler
---
Probably us as well, same group!
---
Yes, but accidentally! 
---
My first character is a Sylvari Ranger. When I went for Map completion a couple of years ago I ended up in the Secluded Glen of the Fields of Ruin - the HP being the very last thing I needed for map completion. I had not known what it was, but ending up in a little nature sanctuary as a Sylvari Ranger, with my starting Sylvari Hound with me, felt fantastic!
---
I'm going for my 2nd Map completion now that I am working on my 3rd Legendary, I'll have to think about where fits next \^\^
---
Yea.  Only thing I can guess it's that the income from expansions isn't outweighing three cost of making them enough.
---
Sure. I didn't mean you shouldn't feel the way you feel.  And I don't mean to say you having emotional responses  is a bad thing. And I do actually think your comment is worthy of discussion, certainly didn't mean to downplay that aspect of it.

I'm more just thinking if I was a developer of the game, I doubt I'd read a comment with constructive criticism in mind, that uses terms like "greedy idiots" and "monumentally stupid blunder", as I feel it damages an otherwise legitmately inciteful and passionate comment. I get you're channeling anger, I just think some select phrasing would help the message come across and perhaps even be more likely to be acknowledged by anet, especially in light of the very subject being to address hostility.  I personally don't usually read much further when I see stuff like that.  
---
But obviously I don't speak for everyone,nor did you ask for advice here, I just thought it was worth mentioning.
---
Base, pof first... Then hot.
---
After 7 years i bought gems to buy the bundle thing where you get 2 storage slots 2 bag slots and 10 keys , 30 dyes worth 4k gems but got it for 2k
---
If by entire community you mean /r/guildwars2, sure. I agree with ya. Because in-game tells a different story.
---
Not saying that things have not been on a shaky leg as of late but you can clearly tell that the majority of the vocal people probably don't even play much, if at all. Hell, just the other day there was a guy here who made a salty post and even admitted to never having played before.
---
(Shrug) Even this sub is infamous with the in-game community lol.
---
/r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Path of Fire.
---
2018, on keys. I used to sprinkle in some money just because I felt like supporting Anet, I trusted them and.. Well.. No more. oTL
---
Jesus. I can't even play for 8 hours straight anymore without wanting to go outside and see the freaking sun. Can't imagine going on for 24 hours non-stop.
---
And 99% of the stuff in the gem store is trash, so yeah.
---
I could see Asgeir's corruption galvanizing the Norn in a cold fury. Sure some in his bloodline and several outside his lineage would probably make the hasty mistakes you mentioned but I could see the race as a whole feeling personally slighted by the desecration of their most celebrated hero after possibly Jora.
---
Make it be 49.99€ every 18 months, and they would be fine.
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOONESAWWWWWWW IS REEEEEEEAAADYYYYYYYYYY
---
never played a necro. any fun? the summons look like a pain. thoughts?
---
GW1 had actual trading which, while not perfect, was far safer.
---
Thank you!
---
And yet I did.
---
Thank you so much! I did not know about this tool, this is great!
---
You....don't actually know how the economic value of things is determined, do you?
---
I don't get the uproar by some people here (not OPs point, for the record), you buy something that was stolen, it gets taken away. That is how it works in life, that is how it works in the game.
---
What's a sun?
---
Unrelated, but it should have been real money only, in my opinion.
---
I just switched my main to a Necro; I had been playing an Elementalist and I find Necro to be good dps with much better survivability. But then I am not a great player or anything and am certainly casual with plenty in the game I haven’t seen yet.
---
Anyway, I love pet classes in MMOs but I have to say it is really annoying how often they despawn in GW2. I can understand them despawning when zoning or starting a story instance, but I hate when they despawn when picking up an item or using one. For example, in Siren’s Landing when you use the ley-line Beast’s organ it will kill all of your pets. And then I have to wait for all the cooldowns to finish.
---
Sure things were often overhyped, but at least I always had something to look forward to which has kept me logging in. Haven't really felt excitement for anything since Colin left Anet.
---
Agree with you, im just annoyed about the account being flagged!
---
Here's the confirmation, bitch.
---

---
Yeah it's too convoluted. Better charge USD 9 (soon to be 20+ when they up the limit) per character...
---
I only have one question...
---
Are you dumb, working for anet or both?
---
I've deleted everything even the %appdata% .  I create 2 profiles, I dont clone the 2nd one, I can only open 1 at a time. Upon opening LaunchBuddy I get an error, could not find file Arenanet.log .
---

---
O-Dog!
---
During the annual August gemstore sale of this year I bought 5 Black Lion Outfit Vouchers. Sadly it's been the only time in 2019 that I've invested money into the game, as interest dwindles and I am becoming increasingly more unhappy with Arenanet's management of the game.
---
Btw the Vouchers are a really cool concept. To give credit where credit is due.
---
Around 50 Black Lion keys every month.
---
you give very little info and most of it is useless
---
the meta food/utility for pchrono can be bought on tp, what recipes? infusions are worth like 800-1k dps or something and can be safely ignored for now..food/utility matters a lot! 
---
as others said your goal is crit cap and having similar stats, doesn't matter on which item..for example you can run full zerk trinkets ascended(easy to get), exotic zerk weapons with full assassin exotic armor and you are 3 precision shy of optimal which doesn't matter
---
do get ascended weapons fast because they have higher weapon strength and autoattacks are important(play illusions version and get at least the mainhand sword)
---
rest has been covered by others
---
edit: zerk(er)=berserker stats in case it's not obvious
---
Ohh wow!
---
Haven't seen that in years and thought it was last in the internet
---
You did it, nice
---

---
Why not just use the current outfit as a placeholder then?
---
Anger is fine, also not at all saying ignore emotions.  Merely stating that name calling might undermine the message you're trying to get across, as it devalued it to me.  You disagree with that. That's perfectly fine.  Cheers friend.
---
You're assuming he means something different from what he explicitly said just because that's how you feel.
---
Sounds like you're getting the hang of it. The 1-80 leveling experience is honestly really easy these days thanks to years of power creep. Post 80 things require a bit more skill.
---
The number of skills you get in guild wars 2 definitely seems small at first, but most of the kits are quite deep and have a lot of interactions that aren't immediately apparent. I would encourage you to frequently re-read skills as you learn more. Some parts of a skill you didn't understand before might suddenly click as very important.
---
I take it the line you bring up is this one:
---
&gt; Asgeir rent it from Jormag's mouth, it is true, but if he could do that  and still be killed by the dragon... what good would scratching this  tooth do? 
---
If we presume this wasn't an error on the writer's part (which it very well could be), my interpretation would be that Aesgir was mortally wounded in the battle. He survived and brought the people south, but died from his wounds in the end. Though I feel like that contradicts other lore about Aesgir's establishment of Hoelbrak, so I'm more inclined to lean towards "accidental retcon".
---
actually i have more character of the same class for this very reason. anyway i do not need so many build. can do copy paste from notepad. equip is ok with 2 atm for me and i think most ppl do not even know what to do with more than 2 equip
---
And a more assertive posture with a staff. Charr casters with a staff (elementalist, mesmer, necromancer, druid, guardian) look like they're cowering away from their enemies when they draw their staff. They should rest the end of the staff on the ground and stand tall, with their chests out.
---
Will this affect the living seasons at all? Should I rush to finish the current one?
---
I've spent about the same every month since the game was released. Yikes &gt;\_&lt;
---
10k is more than enough for anything. remeber diablo3 ah with stupid amount of  gold for and item. money lost their whole meaning
---
It won't affect existing content, it is the next episode in Living World, and you can absolutely finish what you're doing without rushing to it on the 19th
---
That'd be ideal, and they did say they were trying for 2-3 months on living world episodes, but I wouldn't hold them to this cadence just yet, it's a fairly aggressive pace.
---
My hero ❤️

You were wrong this time. This is probably the dumbest criticism I have seen on this sub in a long long time. Actually worse than the guy complaining about having to donate to a charity to get the charity Aurene mini.
---
Edit: Checked your post history because I thought maybe you were the same guy that made the mini post and turns out you just cruise reddit and complain about every game you play. I guess whinging about a tonic is not surprising.
---
Anet is waiting for the storm to blow over instead of commenting on the issue and they are hoping people stop caring. Truly a big sign that they don’t give a duck. They are just waiting for the problem to subside so they can make a PR remark about what happened and how they understand. Don’t waste your time coming up with suggestions for them.
---
Spent 4000 gems in October on mounts and the foefire fashion :p
---
Don't worry about it. I recently finished crafting my weapons, so I guess I did things in the correct order for this part at least. Ascended armor is very daunting for now. 
---
The price for food recipe made me yelp, so I didn't even check out how much the finished products were (hence practise sessions without food - and my questions about calculating things to take the stats difference into account). I guess I just thought that if the recipe was that expensive, the food also had to be prohibitively expensive as well. 
---
Thanks for the advice, come to think of it it makes sense.
---
\*clears throat\*......she looks almost as dead as the game. I'll take my downvotes now, please.
---
I was gonna say that if you actually do lay down but on your back its good for your spine and body to relax etc.
---
But she did it the other way so  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
So that’s why people seem to be swimming in ascended gear for their alts... It explains so much.
---
This in very encouraging, so thank you.
---
Thanks for the food tip as well!
---
For non-australia people confused about this, for us aussies, going to eb games (au gamestop) and using gem cards to pay 15/25 aud is far better than paying usd via the usual digital river method for the same thing. 1 usd roughly translates to 1.5 aud as a rule of thumb. So I could pay roughly 15AUD for 800 gems, or 15AUD for a 1200 gem card the next time I'm in town.
---
Thanks for the heads ùp OP, think my local store ran out at one point.
---
I wouldn't expect episode 2 in January, simply because Anet isn't going to be/shouldn't be working their employees during Christmas/new year. They need some time off too ya know.
---
it's not dumb. he expressed his point. can't understand yours. 10k is more than the avarage player would even need , imagine achieving it
