As a Sailor Moon fan, this is amazing! Wish there was an outfit close to this in game. Also, Sailor Jupiter is the best. :3

Really shows how much we need dulfy. Sad emoji face.

After watch this video I feel sad that I missed the event :(

No matter what I do with Windows Defender I don't get the installer.exe, only the folder.

no, lol. she was gonna be corrupted if not for joko's power. she even said herself "brand in heart, hard to mend". made her basically immune to corruption. but sure jan

mimic should instantly copy the last used utilitie skill kinda like the ultimate from leblanc in LoL. change my mind.
---
I can. There are millions of applications, programs or hell OSes out there where people have no access to the source code, and they still use them without any complaining or paranoia...why should this mod be treated differently?
---
been out of the game for almost a year. is it still alive?
---
EDIT: The issue seems to have been resolved! Deleted the image of the issue because the gloves now look most excellent!
---
Original game is now free. You can buy both expansions, just one, or neither. Most players treat the base game as a trial at this point, as 99% of the content that they're developing is for expansion content like raids, gliders, mounts, and the living story episodes.
---
You realise they added 2v2 maps nearly a year ago right? This is just then adding another one to be used in 2v2 ATs.
---
Yeah, but I kinda need the human face, hair, and body, and voice.  Asura don't really ring well as White Mantle.
---
I know, but we don't have any other official numbers so I took that just for fun.
---
I can do much better than screenshots, I have probably hundreds of videos on my youtube and multiple twitch accounts! But yes I do have a ton of screenshots. I have so many Arah related things that I would love to share but anytime I've tried streaming since returning to the game there just hasn't been even close to as much interest in my content as there used to be :P
---
Here is one of my favorite ones from years ago, when I decided to bomb the starting waypoint with as much chaos at once (excluding the ooze spamming): https://i.imgur.com/sxCJVgM.png
---
Here is the very first picture that I took of Arah when I was a new player. I remember thinking "holy shit what a huge boss" but at the time the pug strat was to just cluster together and range from a distance while 1 person killed grubs that spawn. This was in I think late august 2013: https://i.imgur.com/sGMIFrk.png
---
Picture from november 2013 when I did my first ever Lupi solo. I was feeling super confident and knew I'd win so I hit the prntscrn button mid fight for it as I was not streaming back then lmao. https://puu.sh/61aRk.jpg

Here is me completing a random challenge I set for Goku, Sesshi, Abe, and anyone else that dared to attempt it and all of us always failed. Believe me it is WAY harder than it looks if you want to give it a go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCLPW6IAmVY

Anyways, if you'd like to see pictures from *goating* then I can arrange that, but videos are saved more often :D

---
Will this ever work with gw2hook ?  
---
Because I would like to use it, but I also love my gw2hook setup...and since my game run fairly smooth, I don't see myself giving dx12 a priority over looking better.
---
Well, yeah.  That's sorta how games like this are.
---
I don't think people play silverwastes solely because they have an incredibly strong, heartfelt need to kill the vinewrath, either.
---
r/madlads but jokes aside this is a very impressive feat!
---
The only class I seriously played in GW2 was mesmer. Been playing it since the game launched. The class, chronomancer especially, was so much fun, rewarding, and challenging to play. Then they killed the class in name of balance. Chronomancer was too strong, in terms of allowing room for alternate compositions. But their solution to this was taking away what made the class rewarding, and even left it possibly under-powered. This isn't a  huge surprise, given Anet's questionable ability to balance the game. I haven't played GW2 in over 3 months because of these changes. Mirage is a fun enough class but doesn't provide me anywhere close to my desired gameplay. Assuming the game every releases another proper expansion, they have likely lost me sale as I just can't trust them to keep their game fun and worth playing.
---
Fuck yeah sir you rock the fuck out of a dress.
---
A few ok skins but mostly underwhelming.
---
They look very fake and plasticy and the designs are pretty boring. They are neither flashy and cool, nor sleek, simple and realistic. Just generally uninteresting to me even though I have plenty of shards.
---
&gt;Usually we just get down to business
---
To go beat...your buns!
---
You're not grasping the meaning of the situation. It isn't about 12h play session everyday or quitting. Veterans from all game modes are fed up with the game and are leaving because everything is being neglected aside from gemstore updates and one time play-through of Living story content, meaningful content doesn't exist. It takes 6 months which is half a gosh darn year to get just 1 fractal(Which is Gw2's dungeons since they abandoned the original style dungeon content long ago). and 9 months for a raid. PvP and WvW, yeah, nothing changed and won't change any time soon. Alliances still have no drop date, and for Spvp Anet refuses to add any new permanent supported game mode like 2v2s or 3v3s either because they can't or don't want to take away from their desired supported mode (conquest) ever shrinking population, despite having the best combat system out of all the other MMOs for such modes.
---
And now; all I can see is the figure at the hilt taking a massive dump.
---
I mean hasn't the issue with Chrono been that it's done too many things at once? At least I remember it being pseudo-tank, good dps and essential support at once for a long time. 
---
I almost feel like Arenet made a mistake by wanting to avoid the classic trinity cause that would have streamlined design and roles a lot I feel. Can even do trinity+ with support added onto it.
---
Female charr can wear pants, or skirts, too, Anet. It's only long dresses and coats that look weird.
---
But a ballroom gown with a bustle and boning would probably look fantastic.
---
Hard to mend meaning hard to heal until it was physically removed. Are you that dense?! Holy shit. What was your score in English class?
---
Your right and kinda wrong at the same time.
---
No, You don't have to play a lot but chances are in that free time, you'll look for another game to play.
---
Likely another MMO, which will hook you and let you play meaningful content for your whole playtime. Suddenly there is no reason to log into GW2.
---
Personally I always end up back here with the same fucking complaints I had when I left but there really isn't anything else to scratch my mmopvp itch.
---
Yeah I know, I have one already bound from novelties. I just happen to have 4 axe toys remaining because I bought them years ago long before shared inventory slots were a thing. I guess I just have the one in shared slot because I have basically nothing else to use it for. It's either an executioner axe or an ugly wool sock.
---
Indeed. Condi mesmer was also nerfed out of the game, likely to make room for Condi Mirage, continuing the trend of making the base classes completely useless. And I also forgot to mention, but the constant changes, reworks, etc., were nothing but aggravating as far as gearing went. If I didn't have legendary armor and weapons, I certainly would have quit playing sooner and I truly feel bad for anyone who wanted to try out chronomancer but didn't have those luxuries.
---
Eh... As long as you have enough burst to kill veterans in a sensible amount of time it's probably fine. I haven't tried that build (or played engi in a while, I won't pretend to know that specific class), but some people like to treat all content like world-class raiding speedclears and it's just not. If you were doing CM's or hardmode content I'd recommend a meta guide, but if you're playing open world and doing more than AFK autoattacking it's probably okay.
---
Eh, nah.
---
Some hardcore raiders quit, which is fair, we wasn't getting much raid content.
---
And a few streamers... that's like it.
---
Haha I won't let you or tilla beat me!! I still want to figure out who rank 3 is btw. That guy was the first to overtake rank 1 while I was playing BnS.
---
Well it depends if you mean base necro or reaper. I did it on my necro which I have basicallly no idea how to play and it has only exotic gear, and I was playing reaper for it. I used energy sigil and I took the util called Corrosive Poison Cloud to block projectiles for phases 2 &amp; 3.
---
I also was able to successfully fully AFK phases 1&amp;2 with minion master full clerics once, but sadly you can't AFK phase 3 with cleric necro because he just perma heals off your minions.
---
&gt; Devs get death threats for petty nonsense these days
---
I've been playing MMOs for a very long time now (sob) and it has always been like this. Devs say something, entitled players with no social skills nor emotional IQ go off on them. Devs stop communicating, entitled players with no social skills nor emotional IQ go off on them anyway. Devs make an appearance and the entitled players with no social skills nor emotional IQ say thank you. And then go off on them.
---
Honestly, if I was running any sort of business I'd block all communication with the public beyond press releases. Folks have proven that many of us can't handle it.
---
Yeah I tend to run out of endurance on Phase 2.
---
So the trick is just to spam endurance sigils?
---
I'm glad you remember me :D
---
Hopefully it was a fun all nighter!
---
For real. I don't even have anything to add to what you said lol. Just this. So much this.

I want an Orr themed raid with a big Lupicus boss. Give him tons of 1-shot mechanics as his revenge for all the cheaters who wallsploit 1shot him over the years.

I am on record as also preferring season 2. Using existing maps, adding only a couple of new maps.

---
In absolute terms, there is no difference in the way the program works because it is the same "gw2taco.exe"
---
But there are differences that have been imposed due to the importance of this pack and I will try to explain the reasons in detail in order to avoid having to answer the same question over and over again.
---
In fact, it is important to keep in mind that this pack contains a lot of markers and that to make this accessible it has been planned to make the marker menu as identical as possible to the game's success menu. To do this it was mandatory to modify the file "categorydata.xml".
---
Then to be able to translate the texts in the files "hpgrids.xml, locationnaltimers.xml and maptimer.xml" you also had to modify them. A lot of improvements to the official TacO are based on either my modifications, or that of Tekkits or at least on our reports concerning what we may need or find as concerns such as the fact that TacO manages to load so many markers because at the beginning it could take a few thousand minutes or more to launch. It forced BoyC to completely rethink the overlay's parse algorithm.
---
Then there are the translation files that are not present in the official version and that I keep up to date for the languages (EN, FR, DE, SP, CH) there are missing languages that I would like to add but I have not found a reliable translator.
---
Another modification had been in the CSS, to modify the size of one of the buttons of the marker editor which was not big enough to read the texts and it was more for the job a little bit apart because it was especially useful for me during the creation.
---
The pack also uses textures for trails that are not the same as the official version and it was easier to replace them than to make the pack even heavier.
---
And to reduce the size and avoid duplicating markers, the markers present in the official version are also removed.
---
Idem for /Img/ that have either been redone or replaced!
---
# Details of the changes that could not be made otherwise:
---
* Removing the contents of the **/POIs/** and **/Data/** folders making duplicates or corrections in my version.
---
* **GW2TacO.pdb** \- Removing the unnecessary debug file
---
* **categorydata.xml** : Adaptation of the index for a representation of the menus identical to the game menu.
---
* **maptimer.xml** : Translation of names, additions of season 3 timers and festivals etc...
---
* **locationnaltimers.xml** : Translation and correction of a raid boss phase (Sabetta delay from 2 to 4 seconds on the advice of raid players)
---
* **TacO\_Language\_XX.xml** : Updated translation, and addition of new languages (FR, DE, SP, CH) not present in the official version
---
* **UI.wbs** : Changing the basic marker icon
---
* **UI\_XXXXXXX.css** : Fixed the size of the marker type button in the marker editor.
---
Each time I update my packs all the changes in detail are shown in the patchnote :

To anyone who it may interest if they like seeing goating related stuff I can happily show videos demonstrating how to get to my favorite places in Arah! I think they should be safe from getting nerfed/walled off... I hope. I'm currently trying to work on getting to a spot that I've wanted to get to since early 2014, the [top of the P4 arch above Dwayna's statue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkZvnvPBITk).
---
I have many more spots like that which I can do, so I'll definitely record some and upload to my youtube channel!
---
&gt; Don't you all have phones?
---
Yes, but now this is an .TACO format file, this is the same as an ZIP  
---
Just with this format player dont decompress it.Just put this file in /POIs/ like Tekkit pack.
---
NP : For player who take the complet ZIP this is not the same thing !
---
I explained this in more detail in the following post:

---
Jesus fuck man, if 10k is terrible for a open world solo build (on a sub par dps elite spec) maybe your standards are outa whack. Yes there builds that can out perform what scrapper can do that densest mean 10k dps vs a single target under your own power is somehow unacceptably low for open world content. I would personally love it if more ppl that ran in open world squads could pull 10k on a regular basis.
---
*Weaver* ***triggered***

madness! congrats :D

Now I need to try this when I log on later. Farewell cruel world. :-P
---
I miss seeing that Kessex Hills loading screen. First time I saw it, it made me excited to explore and it looked amazing kinda like the [Argonath](https://d3fa68hw0m2vcc.cloudfront.net/4a3/210100825.jpeg) in LOTR. I also remembered looking for those god statues for ages and couldn't find them.
---
you're not the boss of me
---
I know, it's normal.
---
In fact I put the files in my distribution and I did not update any more because it posed me too much problem.
---
Basically the Google Sheet is to help the creation, and I did not want to have to maintain each update thereafter.
---
It therefore required the player to take the original file and change itself the texts by taking the text of the Google Sheet. Not practical I admit
---
I will do it I do not always think but I did a pack containing all the language files up to date (taco version 040.2290r)
---
https://www.heinze.fr/taco/files/TacOLanguagePack.zip
---
That wouldnt work, especially with quickness limit being 5 stacks. You would overwrite massively and quickness would be completely non-sustainable solo even with 100% bd. It's better to get 10 sec quickness with 3 sec delay than get 2,5 sec quickness every second for 4 seconds. Also it would create another problem as people would have to stay within that small aoe for 3/4 secs to get the most of it which gets really tedious especially in fracs. 
---
FB just craps instant 5 sec quickness stacks + 10/15 sec with elite. By far the best way to apply it without overwriting the existing stacks.
---
The only reason people still bother with chrono in raids  is mostly for portals and pulls but other than that it's just not optimal anywhere  anymore.
---
Gorgeous! I love it.
---
Why is it that when I read this title I read it to that song “on top of spaghetti all covered in cheese” or w/e it’s called.

Damn skins.... my wife's gonna kill me.

---
It was kinda fun in year 1. Now it's all annoying stealth BS and insta-kills or immortal builds that can't be killed. Now, I'd rather get a root canal. With each patch you either get screwed or another class becomes unstoppable for a few months.
---
I did not notice any problem, but I will see that in more detail and fix that.
---
I must say that I focus mainly on full versions and external versions are just doing more and often ask me a little more control because I do not usually check how it will appear in all configurations.
---
Thank you for pointing this out, I'll do this as soon as possible, I think it will be corrected for my next update, keep an eye on the site or the RSS feed

Are you feeling adventurous?

Everything about this is obnoxious.

I hope this dude gets ripped at the gym, and goes to work for the WWE or something. His improv as the "Snake" persona is amazing, and he would make a great heel.

You'd have to find the specific shader, get it in hlsl, edit it, and then save it to the custom shaders folder.
---
It's honestly one of the most beautiful PvP maps they've ever made.
---
No matter how much I may complain about other aspects of the game, I have nothing but praise for the artists at ArenaNet.

And he's doing it for free too
---
I think that a lot of devs were under a silence order until closer to the August 30th release. 
---
Now that we're closer to the date, they can talk more.

I think it was part of an event on live chat or twitch. I can't remember. I found this video I remember from back then :

Didn't say expantiln content, I saod living world and yes it doea fit the definition. Google it and learn to reaf.

weird flex but ok

I don't need to google something I've been discussing and reading about for 15 years. Thanks though. The living world doesn't make this game pay to win, if for no other reason than you don't have to pay to own it. There are other reason too but you know, believe what you want. Most reasonabel people won't agree with you.

Thanks!

Yep, first thing that popped into my head.
---
Very very very very very nice no other comments &lt;3
---
Nor are the numbers of subscribers in this subreddit a good indicator of active members here. So Zosin's guesstimate is probably as good as any. Even if he's off by 100% this sub accounts for less than 5% of the GW2 community.
---
This is madness I say!
---
and does he mention anything new that hasnt been mentioned yet a thousand times? Didnt think so...
---
Yeah it took 6 weeks to get enough people for that larp untill you came crashing in like a jackass
---
Monk's outfit looks to be from Paizo rather than GW2. Entertainer's and Scholar's outfits are from D&amp;D 5e. Most of the assets were probably ripped from an image search.
---
Why though?
---
This is a very well-written post and I can tell you really do feel strongly about Chronomancer, but I'm gonna throw my two cents in as well. Again, this is *my opinion*, so don't take it with a boulder of salt.
---
&gt; Sigil of Concentration Boons you apply last 33% longer for 7 seconds when you swap to this weapon while in combat. (Cooldown: 9 Seconds) --&gt; +10% Boon Duration
---
The old Sigil of Concentration was extremely overpowered on any boon-related build. 33% is just way too high of a number when it comes to granting stats, especially something as strong of Concentration, which is *still* way too strong in PvE. Even at its current value of 10%, it is still a very worthwhile sigil to use, especially for build convenience. 33% boon duration amounts to an **insane** amount of Concentration, which shouldn't be a thing. Imagine if Sigils of Accuracy was 33% crit chance; it would drastically devalue Precision and everyone would run in on every build. 
---
&gt; Signet of Inspiration: The active effect of this signet no longer shares the mesmer's boons with allies. Instead, it now extends the duration of all allies' current boons by 5 seconds.
---
Whether or not people deemed old SoI to be overpowered, you have to admit that it is a balance disaster, and it comes from a time when boon sharing wasn't nearly as prevalent as it is nowadays; aka back when Concentration didn't exist. Had this signet remained in its older state, the balance team would have to take into account every. single. skill. that granted Mesmer any kind of boon on any future elite spec for the rest of time. It made certain traits, like Bountiful Disillusionment difficult to balance, because it effectively **doubled** its effectiveness, which put it in a position of either being overpowered forever due to the existence of SoI, or forced into a state where it's drastically *underpowered* if not used with SoI. All-in-all, the old Signet of Inspiration was very unhealthy for the game, and I agree with its new incarnation, although I do agree that it is much less interesting, which I suppose is fine since it's a low-cooldown utility skill after all. It still sees play everywhere due to its ability to be traited for a higher target cap, so at least it hasn't been nerfed to death or anything. 
---
&gt; Signet of Ether: This skill's recharge time now begins at the same time as phantasm skills are recharged.
---
There was a trick where you could get an additional set of phantasms by using CS directly after ether (before the skill went on cooldown), allowing the skill to come off cooldown when continuum split ended.
---
This sounds like an unintentional oversight from the devs. Either way, it's still used all the time in all formats of the game, so this change is definitely not a big deal at all. Signet of the Ether is another skill that has been very controversial in a lot of areas of the game throughout the years, so seeing a change like this doesn't exactly shock me or worry me in the slightest. 
---
&gt; (New Chronomancer Shatters)
---
This has to do with Anet's approach of making elite specializations unique from their core profession counterparts. I am definitely a huge fan of making elite specializations feel like their own classes, so I am in favor of the new Chronomancer shatters. *That being said,* I do think that they are a little poorly-tuned. The biggest outlier is Rewinder, the condition-damage shatter that replaces Cry of Frustration. 'Purity of purpose' is a phrase that Anet loves to throw around all the time, and for good reason. Having elite specializations fulfill unique niches is important to keep them relevant in the future. *However*, I think they missed the mark with the new Chronomancer shatters. Chronomancer has never been intended to fulfill a condition damage-focused playstyle -- that's the Mirage's job. So Rewinder is very over-tuned in the damage department and under-tuned in the utility department (something that Chronomancer should be balanced around). On top of that, Split Second, the replacement for Mind Wrack, is very underpowered in comparison to the condition shatter, which seems very backward to me. A **much** bigger issue that for some reason isn't mentioned in this post as far as I saw is the removal of the Illusionary Persona mechanic of Chronomancer shatters. This is a HUGE nerf to the elite spec, but I don't think that is necessarily that bad of an idea. I think it's a fine decision to make Chronomancer play and feel differently from core Mesmer. There's no reason for Chronomancer to have the same exact shatters as core Mesmer because core Mesmer already exists. I don't believe that Anet should revert this huge change, but rather they should look to give Chronomancer shatters compensation buffs in the future. Imo, change for the sake of change is a good thing, as long as it doesn't totally ruin things, and we should be grateful that at the new Chronomancer shatters, apart from Split Second, are at least more powerful when you disregard the removal of IP. As for Distortion, I think it's a good change to remove it from Chrono. Chrono already has way too many defensive cooldowns that have made it a seriously broken bunker in the past, and removing Distortion is a fair enough change. Chrono still has double Shield Stance, Blurred Frenzy, and other defensive measures that can be taken, and that's not even taking into account that they can potentially be spammed often with things like Continuum Split and Mimic. There are a lot of classes in GW2 that wish they could have half of Chrono's defensive skills and traits.
---
&gt; Permanent Alacrity and Quickness
---
This alone is still to this day a massive advantage that Chronomancer has over other boon supports. Quickness and Alacrity are both extremely strong boons, and Chrono still remains the king of them both since it is, and has always been, the only class that can provide both, which is a very important thing to take into account when looking at other classes such as Firebrand and Renegade. As far as I know, Alacrity is supposed to be Chronomancer's primary boon, and I think that the amount of quickness application available to Chronos flies in the face of Anet's idea of 'Purity of Purpose.' This isn't even an example of an elite spec abusing core profession abilities, either. Unlike Berserker abusing core Warrior's Banners to make itself viable in PvE, this is Chronomancer abusing its own skills to become super strong. If anything, SoI is to blame since it's a skill that isn't Chronomancer-exclusive and feels forced upon them to make their own skills more valuable (again, similar to Berserker's situation). I know Anet likes the idea of Chronomancer being able to both quicken their allies through Alacrity and Quickness, while also slowing their enemies through... slow, but it's still a very strong niche that needs to be taken into account when looking to balance the rest of the elite spec. 
---
Again, this is all my own opinions, so feel free to disagree with them. I literally took nearly 10 minutes of my free time to write this up, so take that into account before you harass me because your opinion differs from mine. As a long-time player with lots of game knowledge, I just want to throw my opinions in when it comes to balance in order to improve it in the future, not to just be a whiny baby like... a lot of other people. Seriously, the comments on Reddit and the official forums on balance update posts are cringy as hell. I take pride in being the 1% that attempts to get a decent discussion out of balance patches.

The site most likely is not making money off this image, which technically means it's not worth making a stink about.
---
That's actually cute. A small, little, roleplayer's page.
---
damn thats crazy.  Congrats.
---
I'm about halfway through it, and it's sort of a mixed bag for me? 
---
On the pro side, there's the lore -- it's nice seeing in-game locations fleshed out, and having played the game it's easy to paint those mental pictures.  The story itself seems to be shaping up into a fun adventure, too.
---
On the con side, though ... the writing is bland at best, and occasionally outright cringey, like a mid-rate YA novel at best.  I mean, literally using 'orbs' instead of 'eyes' levels of cringe.  Also it suffers a bit from Mass Effect syndrome imo -- the non-human characters in the ensemble seem like the really interesting players, but they're overshadowed by obnoxious, aggressively unlikable human characters.  
---
It might just be that I've been through enough books by now to be wholly sick and tired of narratives that are either unaware of (which it feels like here) or unwilling to address the fact that their perspective vehicles are bags of dicks who are being, well, dicks, which leads to a narrative that feels like it's condoning not only that dickishness but the sense of superiority that accompanies it.  Without spoiling anything, it feels deeply out of character to see these human characters getting treated like victims who need to be apologized to every time they deliberately taunt and provoke other races.  I mean, it absolutely could have been done well (especially given the racial politics of Tyria, which are super interesting to explore especially in this exact period in the timeline!), and maybe the authors will save it by the end, but with the way the whole world is so far warping itself around condoning the main's shitty attitude and behavior, I'm not super hopeful.  I'll finish it, but tbh if it weren't attached to GW2, it'd already be sitting on a shelf at my local Goodwill, where it's likely headed as soon as I'm done with it.
---
I mean, I'd say go ahead and give it a shot, especially if you're into Generic Fantasy Writer's fantasy? But maybe buy it on the cheap if you can swing it.

Siren Reef fractal.
---
&gt; The new shatters are blatant nerfs outside of F2
---
I agree with else everything you said, but the new shatters are all upgrades over the others. Anet took away IP and the ability to shatter without clones but attempted to compensate that by power creeping all of the new shatters. I still think that they could be more powerful, but they are definitely in themselves 100% better than the other existing shatters.
---
Chronos have been zzzzzz for over a year tbh. And even if it was to open other supports, they’re gameplay is even more boring than current chrono. At least chronos was interesting to play at one point
---
Uh. I don't really see much of a difference. Both is going to be released a piece every few months, so LS is episodic by nature, no matter if you call it episodes or acts or whatever.
---
If we look at the changes [pragmatically](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/82231/the-new-shatters-in-numbers), we can see that they are essentially nerfs. Both F1 and F2 are only marginally better damage-wise than the old versions with three clones, and that's only the case with the former if there is slow on the boss. You simply don't get enough clone generation to do three-clone shatters each time, and you can't cast any free shatters with no clones up anymore.
---
It's overall a nerf, and this is reflected by the fact that the pChrono benchmarks lost between 1-3k DPS each after the changes. The only build that resulted in a net buff was condi Chrono.
---
This is a dumb question but what are the yellow angry Halloween looking pumpkin icons supposed to represent? Is there a key for Taco or all these map markers that actually explain what they stand for?
---
Sylvari female have the nicest idle animations, she's just happy to be standing right here right nie, no matter what is going on around.
---
&gt; Let's not even question how Firebrand can maintain 100% uptime with a full berserker setup. Or how renegade can maintain more than twice the uptime of alacrity compared to chrono, a class designed around alacrity specifically, with only 1 fucking button. Or how revenant and almost renegade is capable of 100% uptime of projectile denial.
---
This is honestly what pisses me off the most about it. Chrono had to center it's entire playstyle around maintaining boons, but when you play firebrand/rev it's literally just an afterthought. The amount of effort you have to put in to play those two classes is so low I feel like I'm not even contributing to the squad by playing it. My guess is that's what anet thinks the game needs, more accessible support classes for people who can't do more complex rotations. As if it'll encourage more people to play high end content.
---
So are you able to modify taco itself or just adding taco packs into a one giant collection?
---
Go to dragonfall and buy 5 of each currency from the vendor everyday

Thank you so much, that has really helped focus me on a few things. JB x

i know. i think megai once even told me which shader it is. unfortunately i haven't had any time to do it yet.

and the edit would be pretty easy too: output = input, basically.

So.....that's how it happened to Demi's mother.

Thank you, you definitely made me realise that I need to love my character/class and build if I'm going to stick at it. JB x

No, no it's not bad at all. It's clearly the superior version.

Yeah this is pretty much what happened.

&gt;Top 2 recurring themes for '~~LW5~~ every prediction post' - Cantha and Tengu.
---
Obviously not
---
So to be precise, I can not change the code of the program "Gw2TacO.exe" this one is not editable and that's fine as well. The executable will always be the official and unmodified.
---
And yes, I'm just creating marker packs.
---
When we have a problem with TacO or need improvement or modification, we share it with BoyC who adds it to the Todo-List if possible and adds it when he can. There have been many improvements or changes of this sort.
---
You have to talk about the markers that have the following icon: https://i.imgur.com/sb5ii2t.png
---
These are the markers for the Halloween festival.
---
When you install TacO the first time, it displays all available markers, I made sure (only in the full version) to pre-set TacO so that it does not display the markers which avoids having too much information at once.
---
Then just check the success or we want to see them to display.
---
NB: This does not work on the external packs because you have to modify a file in the root of TacO and that is one more reason why I have a complete version with TacO already present.
---
Except, as a Mursaat, Lazarus is heavily tied to the White Mantle. Like, the White Mantle worship the Mursaat. Literally. The fact that you deal with both Lazarus and the Mantle at the same time makes perfect sense?

It's late here so I'll just give my final piece on how me, a random guy from the internet that plays GW 2 would balance the current situation, and some proposed changes to Chronomancer.
---
***
---
1- For Renegade (Which is what I play the most currently due to fractals):
---
I'm pretty happy with the way renegade is balanced overall when it comes to the legends and their skills, except for the F4 button.
---
It is literally 'just give me one of the best boons in the game 100% of the time with no effort'. The only real player engagement is resource management, which isn't all that complex since the energy cost isn't that high and at most you have 1-2 seconds before you activate it again. I *would* maybe try something akin to, when you use F4, it consumes your stacks of Kalla's favor to increase its potency/duration, and generating Kalla's favor should be harder to gain, and a bit easier to lose. 
---
I'd probably try making it so gainining Kalla's favor is tied to how long you keep your toggeable skills on, so that if you mess up, you have to disable the skill, and you'll end up losing stacks depending on your timing while you regenerate your energy to use F4 (Perhaps legend swapping cuts the stacks in half?).  (Not too keen on this one, but...)F2/F3 could also consume said stacks to power them up.
---
Give a very small ICD to the Kalla Elite (seriously, if you are any kind of class with multiple strikes, you go from 0 to full health almost instantly), and make it stack up to X charges, stacking its damage/heal to take effect on the next hit, kind of how it works for the reworked revenant demon elite. That'd help to balance its effects on groups that have extremely fast hitting skills, as well as slower hitting classes.
---
Reduce some of the (let's be honest) quite frankly ridiculous amount of CC that Revenant staff 5 brings to the table (it really feels like when Chrono shield 5 CC when it was 'bugged'). Yeah, it feels great to see the boss' defiance bar melt, but I think it could be tuned down a bit.
---
Firebrand is a harder one to 'fix', since it brings *SO MUCH* to the table, and its kit is incredibly stacked. You have: Fury, might, swiftness, regeneration, aegis, stability, retaliation, protection, aegis, resistance, vigor, pulls, knockbacks (all off the top of my head) imbued in your tomes, and your shouts/weapon skills/mantras.
---
Maybe using 1 tome should put all other tomes in a small cooldown? (That doesn't fix the problem and it is a pretty big 'patchwork'). I guess the only thing you could do with such a stacked kit is just increase cooldowns/reduce durations. (Seriously, now that I think about it, firebrand is *SO* stacked in the boon department, it's hard to separate it from its existing skills without making them useless/underwhelming). 
---
Throw the firebrand in the garbage bin, there fixed. :D
---
Now as for our Chrono boi...
---
You still cannot shatter without any clones present.
---
Boon sharing should not return to SOI, otherwise Chrono becomes a kinda cheap boon bot/relay again. 
---
Make Chrono's big contribution being the 1 stop guy for both Alacrity and Quickness on a single character for its sub. Please make his wells pulse the boons instead of doing it at the very end. This 'all or nothing' boons on the wells is garbage. ~~Please pugs, stand on the fking wells &gt;:(~~
---
Give him a base trait in which every time a Chrono swaps weapons, it generates an illusion, and maybe a phantasm for each illusion alive that deals some damage and that after a few seconds turns into an illusion.
---
Increase his CC capabilities slightly in his weapons, and make it so his shatters give certain boons to allies when shattered at max clones, along with its existing effects.
---
(I'm just gonna spitball some boons here, I don't remember if chrono already gives them, maybe he'd only give 1 of the boons I've written down on each shatter in this imaginary version? Maybe?) 
---
F1 gives Might/Fury, F2 gives Regeneration/Swiftness/Vigor, F3 gives Stability/Retal/Protection. CS gives Aegis/Resistance does the CS split as usual. This would make him still be able to give all the boons, but how fast he'd be able to do it would be in accordance to how well he can generate clones.
---
Since the BIS is almost always a character that brings extra dps to the table, give him a skill (Maybe an extra effect of SOI?) or a trait that upgrades his CS split or some other shatter, causing all targets around him to be damaged by a small percentage of the damage he(or/and his allies) dealt during the CS split/short window to them. Or maybe when he shatters his CS split, all allies deal an extra portion of their damage to the target they are attacking, kinda like Kalla elite.
---
Or maybe every time the chrono gets distortion he could have his allies deal some extra damage.
---
IMO that should make the chrono be swapping his weapons consistently, and trying his best to always get to 3 clones as quickly as possible and shattering at the more appropriate times, as well as trying to grant his allies extra damage when they are about to burst. It will also make him give certain boons if the Chrono can keep up with his shatters/clone generation. Of course, this doesn't fix the fire elephant in the room that gives a truckload of boons, but that's all I came up with on the spot.
---
Now I sleep.
---
_E-sports is way too strong beast to tackle by just mere balance or making tournament._
---
WoW doesn't have e-sports anymore. Acti-blizz fired pretty much whole e-sports team as extra cost (but they still sell support packs for e-sports lmao).
---
Current Esport kings are Fortnite, LoL, DotA 2, Overwatch and maybe CS:go? Fighting game tournaments outside EvO is non-existent. 
---
You just don't compete with those. People don't care about MMO pvp enough to watch it so it would have to compete with a god damn Fortnites for views.
---
So i still need some paths for my dungeon master title... can I hire you?
---
Would love a high mobility spec for necro using sword.
---
Cantha has some lore about vampires after all.
---
Could call it the blood lord.
---
Spears for use on land would actually not be out of the question.
---
The coding to use them on land has been in the game since original launch.
---
They just need abilities tied to them with slight animation alterations.
---
So... I'm gearing a condi mirage for raids. Everything is on viper's, but it's only exotic (5 trinkets and a chest piece ascended). How much of the perfect benchmark damage am I going to miss? Is it ok to play with exotic gear?
---
Why?
---
That OC should force GPU in 2000+ mhz.

---
I did my dailies for reward track potions for weeks and by the time ep6 dropped I had about 200+ of each mat
---
Tewhee xDdd
---
&gt; It probably wouldn't take long at all to implement.
---
A dev commented months (years?) ago about this feature, asking which combination of what we would prefer seeing had they decided to go through with these changes. So no, it's not fast to implement.
---
this isnt a job for 2 artists, its for an entire team of software engineers
---
It's fine, at least if you're not crafting and are just relying on drops.
---
If you're crafting them, then it's better to go straight to ascended as opposed to exotic *then* ascended.
---
thanks alot dude

&gt; 1% is irrelevant. In your scenario I still spent 100 minutes doing shitty content just to avoid getting ripped 15% off the rewards I earned through the content I enjoy. It doesn't matter that it was 1%, an hour and a half of boredom is shit.
---
You are just spending those 1% on shitty content because you choose to, not because someone dictates it. There is plenty of content in GW2, some it you deem more fun than other content and some of it more rewarding than other content. Whatever you find fun and rewarding is subjective, so make your own choice, if the expected reward is worth completing the content for you.
---
&gt; Your argument is that the rewards per click salvaging is really good, hence its fine. That's a naive argument because it ignores something important, whether or not the activity is fun. Fun is an essential aspect for gw2 to remain profitable and in production. Any system being examined in a game must consider this aspect.
---
My main argument wasnt that the status quo of unidgear/salvaging is fine and couldnt be improved, it was that it isnt as bad and takes up as much time as you make it out to be.
---
&gt; Fun is of course subjective. So then how do we discuss it? Well, gw2 is clearly a game centered around a fluid combat system. Virtually everything in the game is centered on combat. So then why does everything in the game give a reward which requires so much clicking?
---
&gt; A system which would fit a combat centered game like gw2 would be for raw materials to drop directly and are automatically deposited into material storage.. The system as it is now, is really stupid, and would be more at home in a game like runescape where a core gameplay experience is manipulating items in your inventory.
---
First of all, I wouldnt neccessarily agree that GW2 is combat centric, its as much about appearance as it is about skill and also the game economy is an integral part of the game, at least thats what Anet stated as their intentions for it.
---
But this is only a matter of opinion. Of course the player should be able to focus on the "fun" aspect of the game, whatever that may be for them and not be forced to do stuff they dont like.
---
But if you only spend 1% of your playtime with shitty chores to sort your loot and are able to have fun 99% of the time, why should Anet in your opinion focus on slashing 0,5% off the time you spend on them instead of improving the content you play for fun 99% of your time? 
---
Its wasted effort because it has little to no impact on the player experience.
---
Okay! Thank you!!
---
Good writeup of anets history of fucking that class to death with their stupid decisions. Don't think we even need to discuss a lot at this point, just leave the game or be quiet. Because it ain't gonna change ever again to the good old days - and they are too incompetent to actually have a vision for good new days.
---
Cobalt &lt;3 It looks gorgeous!
---
There were some bigger tournament organizers looking at gw2 pvp when the first season started, they saw how broken the game was and pulled out.
---
Omg thats so cool
---
&gt; watch it gradually become less and less rewarding
---
Playing Chrono felt like developing Alzheimers over the last 2 years.
---
Okay...rifle then
---
Highly biased opinion here, but if you worked your ass off to become that good you kinda deserved making raids and fractals "a joke" back in the day. If we had distort chrono and current firebrigade in the same meta, imho we'd have healthy beginner raids and healthy high skill ceiling raids.
---
If you have to spend some time in each LS4 map anyways, I would consider having a look at the [required collections](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vision_I:_Awakening) you need to make the Legendary Ring Vision. They all require certain achievements/collections to be completed in each LS4 map, so it might be a good idea completing some of those already while playing the maps.
---
You wont be able to make Vision before you finish the skyscale and it would cost even more of the LS currencies if you choose to do it afterwards but once you got the skyscale, you will have a good understanding of all the LS4 maps to consider if the additional requirements for Vision are something you want to do or not.
---
Hammer pls
---
Oh, i was wondering why the utilization is the same with the game runnning and when there is no changes for GPU to render

That's awesome. Did you follow Josh Foreman's tutorial?

For reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VoJlng2b8o
---
But... why?
---
i got patched, i have 5 clients so that was fun. still looking for patch notes
---
They stated several time that this is what they doing. Also gem store skins are made from different people than this is done.
---
I’m afraid to say that this is most likely the end of bik and gw2.
---
Idk, was it Skai? Was it someone random? How the fck should i know.
---
Not in gaming it doesn't due to Intel's better memory latency. When clocked to same speed, AMD pulls ahead in anything that's not gaming due to better IPC.
---
It'll be a nice option to have I suppose, but I wonder how high this will be on the priority list of to-dos for their engineers.
---
Personally, I'd prefer an option to switch between showing 1 character at a time and showing multiple characters (all?) at a time. It'll make for great account snapshots.
---
Lol you’re so salty that your guild got exposed.  KISS is known for being trash
---
noice
---
thats nice, BUT WHY!?
---
If you want to do it fast, get your 10 characters and run hearts. You should be done in no time. If you want least grindy... Idk, give up? Skyscale is nothing but a grindfest.

There are only casuals on this reddit who care about pve and fashion wars.

I wouldn't expect the current GW2 population to be more than 1 million regular players tbh.
---
that was goku I think
---
LUL
---
I just gave up. The amount of effort and time required is ridiculous and totally not worth it. Just like stupid griphon. I hate collections. And I especially hate collections that unlock collections that unlock collections that unlock collections that unlock collections that unlock collections...
---
I'd love it if they opened the raid wings as public instances like the labyrinth and just let players go at it.
---
Zerg vs Raid boss would be hilarious.
---
I didn't know about the signet-phantasm thing, sounds like a bug or unintended at least so it's good thing it got changed.
---
TBH I'd rather see quickness, alac and slow (+cd increase from chill) removed all together, at least in PvE. It's cheesy and profs/specs that have access to it (and, what's worse, can share it) end up being just providers of that boons. BORING
---
I also dislike how many of the core mesmer traits got reworked to work on summon or shatter. 66% of traits are triggered by either this or interrupt (which is pvp mostly thing). Rending Shatter, Illusion of Vulnerability and Dazzling - they're basically the same thing, in the same traitline! BOOOOORING. The whole profession should be redesigned from scratch because currently mesmer is competing with thief for the most boring traits (+power, +power ,+power, even more power if you wield dagger/staff/whatever)

I once double-encoded a passage in base64 and ROT12 into the text file, revealing the future direction of the story for the game I was working on. When the data miner shared it, no one in the community bothered to decipher.
---
Heh.
---
Anet has said their announcement is about the future of the "Story", so I highly doubt anything will change from their current development of mediocre single player story content.
---
Creepy foreshadowing is TIGHT!
---
You're dedicating 2 raid spots for firebrand and renegade, so it should feel more impactful? I get that people are pissed about how chrono got mechanically worse but in terms of power level chrono is fine. I dont want to go back to chaos chrono which could give you literally every boon in the game permanently.
---
I've always thought the sylvari female idle animations as being ditzy as heck, as if her brains are spilling out of her ear when she tilts her head. I know its supposed to invoke a wide-eyed, enthusiastic innocence, but gosh if she doesn't look like ding-a-ling. Ah well, bless her heart. :)
---
That's a HUGE bummer! :(

Anet has announced before that they stop policing name from religion, so you're free to jerk around with christian, hinduism, or budhism name. Unless you're mocking islamic name, then they'll purge your character to oblivion.

The HoT maps get more populated during their associated meta event, which is on a timer that you can find in multiple places, like GW2timer.com or the GW2 wiki's [event timer page,](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers) which you can also find by typing "/wiki et" into chat (you can put anything you want to search the wiki for after /wiki, too, like /wiki mesmer).
---
I'd say PoF is still worth it, although you really don't *need* it for anything other than PoF/LS4 maps and story, the PoF elite specs, mounts, and the PoF raids (Hall of Chains, Mythwright Gambit, and The Key of Ahdashim). You didn't lose access to anything you had before.
---
WvW I only play a bit, and sPvP I haven't played in a while, so I can't say much, although WvW got a mount and a new reward track system.

There have been some changes to classes, especially recently, with Anet trying to make tradeoffs for taking elite specs over core. Reapers, Tempests, Dragpnhunters, and Heralds were barely touched so far, although core Revenants now have an F2 skill with different effects depending on your active legend. Druids have reduced stats on their pets, and Daredevils have Steal replaced with Swipe, which has less range but is unblockable. I don't remember if this happened before or after HoT, but engis got an F5 for their elite skill's toolbelt skill, but now Scrapper has their function gyro replace it. Berserker actually got an interesting rework. Now they don't have access to the normal adrenaline bursts anymore, instead they now can only use adrenaline bursts during berserk mode, but the rage skills all increase the time left in berserk mode instead of giving adrenaline (although the healing and elite skill both still do). Also, Berserkers had most of their berserk bursts buffed (power Berserker is a thing now). Last of all, Chronos no longer have access to fun.
---
Okay fine, I'll be a bit more specific and a bit less hyperbolic. Distortion and Continuum Shift got merged into one skill, shatters no longer trigger off the Chrono themselves, and they can't use shatters without clones. And a while ago, Signet of Inspiration's active went from sharing your boons to extending the duration of boons on you and your allies, plus Mimic isn't affected by CS anymore.
---
Besides Thieves getting new skills to replace traps and a bunch of skills now having multiple uses that recharge over time, I think that was most of the recent changes.
---
Most likely don't want their office Hebdo'd or something
---
Shield/Shield Guard
---
He's a really cool player.  I'd feel bad if he was forced to change names.
---
I havent played the game in a very long time how does his name have legendary in it?
---
It depends a lot on the song. For some songs like the Shigatsu song we only practiced for maybe 30-45 minutes, but for other songs with more people it was several hours! Several hours not including practice alone without the whole band. Chouchou Musubi was probably 3-4 hours of practice together as a group and quite a few more alone. Other groups probably practiced way more than that for other songs!
---
Even then, the main thing that takes time in my experience is tabbing the song, and making it sound good in the game.
---
man, I remember I tried to put the word "dot" in one of my characters name and it didn't let me, I still don't know what is offensive in the word dot
---
&gt; Did you ever manage to break out of the map?
---
Oh boy. You want map breakouts you're talking to the right person. Goating is *the* endgame content, and it has always been by far my most favorite thing to do in games. So fun! I also know essentially every single map breakout related thing pertaining to Arah, and would be more than ecstatic to demonstrate them for you and/or anybody interested!
---
Do you play on EU? Send me a message and I'd be happy to help you through the dungeon during times that I am available!

maybe yet another ninja spying patch to catch cheaters that will be removed soon from game client again
---
We need a 2h melee weapon. Greatsword!
---
You ever try one of these?
---
You ever try one of *theeeeeese*?
---
I see, thanks for clearing that up.  
---
Jesus Christ tho? Isn't that in conflict with the naming policy?   
---
Like my nephew's friend who wanted to use Muhammed (since that's his name) and support "advised" against using that name to not get into trouble?
---
best crossover :D
---
Really this is overall a quality post.
---
They should either respect every religion or ignore every religion. Why can I meme christians all they long while being expected to give muslims free pass?
---
Careful not to pop a blood vessel
---
Thanks. :)
---
Not sure, but I've seen this guy around for about 6 months in-game, if not more...
---
... but why?
---
Admirable achievement nontheless xd I've never done that dungeon aside of story mode. I'm cheesing the dungeons skins with pvp reward tracks in custom arenas instead.
---
I'm glad you liked it
---
Thank you to everyone who attended, players and audience, for making it as nice of an evening as it was.
---
Also big shoutout to our streamers and recorders
---
Scepter and focus for Rev, we need to spice up the gameplay and gs would keep it melee oriented.
---
&gt;And trust me, you don't wanna know how disgustingly savage can people be when you hit that point. So good move from Anet imo.
---
So people can have religious names in GW2 like this post, but god forbid Islamic names are used because "disgustingly savage" things might happen?  
---
This is a HUGE double standard and the fact that you consider some muslims to be savages speaks volumes.
---
Grtz. :)  So If I'll look for someone to do W4 you're my (wo)man?
---
The tags match 😀

---
BAD advice.  
---
Ryzen is king across the entire market right now and Intel's offering is bad performace/price value.  
---
Yes, in some titles Intel pulls ahead but it's at a price and it's only 5% in specific scenarios.  
---
Seriously, recommending an Intel CPU to anyone at this point in time is borderline criminal.
---
Its security standards. Double security standards.

This should grant a title and Achievement points. Would immediately bring intensive to play Dungeons back!

---
Part of free speech comes with realisation that everything can be mocked and that people will never be unified, so different opinions, views and jokes will happen. Is it appropriate? Depends on who you ask. Everything is relative. If mocking christians comes with no consequences, so should mocking muslims. Either you protect all religions or you allow disrespecting all of them.
---
Ahhh yes, can't use Islamic names.... except the dev states...
---
&gt; Essentially; if your name doesn't express hate and doesn't violate our game-rating we're probably gonna let it live on. This includes deity names. Going forward you're probably going to see Jesus Christ, God, and Allah running around Tyria.
---
For the ignorant, of which you appear to be, Allah is an Islamic figure and the dev talks about that name as being one that will be allowed.
---
So pull your head out and stop pushing divisive lies.
---
It means the terrorists won.
---
I also didn't hear of any muslim country invading a christian one for fake reasons and leaving country a mass for terrorism to breed.
---
These type of talks make no sense, just like what i just said can be "countered" with something else.
---
If you want to look at history, Christianity took more lives than any other religion in history of human kind. Not that it proves anything but if we are making stupid "this or that"s, there is that.
---
Both religions have enough fanatics to say they both suck.
---
funny, but not a name allowed under A-net naming policy. Because it references religion.
---
Apparently the song I was thinking of is based on the tune of even another song “on top of old Smokey”.

Hol' up. So you're saying because Christians aren't being offended by these "insensitive" character names and don't decide to blow up/ gun people down, it's their fault the double standard exists?  
---
I'd say Christians are the progressive ones and can have a laugh at something silly like this rather then getting violent. They get on with their day and hold on to their own values and aren't bothered by other people's attempt at mocking their religion. Muslims on the other hand, as shown in recent years will call out for war and start blowing shit up.
---
No chance that 1 out of 5 players read this subreddit.
---
Your argument is based on the assumption every form of response is equal. It isn't. Freedom of speech isn't freedom from consequence. Freedom of speech means that you are allowed to say anything you want without threat of bodily harm, incarceration and damage of property. It doesn't mean you're protected from people calling you an asshole for your views, disagreeing with you, coming back at you with a better insult, poking holes at your logic, etc.
---
The double standard practiced by ArenaNet is practiced by every organization that is being pragmatic. Right now, the one demographic that is most prone to resorting to violence as a response for having their feelings hurt are the Muslims. I want to emphasize this does NOT mean every Muslim is violent. But by general perception, they are disproportionately inclined to violently retaliate to religious insult compared to followers of other religions.
---
Bottom line: It's not okay to be an asshole, but anyone should be allowed to be one. Assholes should suffer consequences, but don't deserve jail, loss of property, physical injury or death.
---
If you choose not to say certain things out of respect, good for you. If you don't understand the importance for people to speak without fear of bodily harm, then you don't understand what is called a REASONABLE RESPONSE.
---
Still didnt work sadly. Maybe its just my computer. Tried pso\_compile on and off and it had no real effect (and no fps drops).  
---
Random NPC pop-ins, some objects are not there until you are meter from them, enemy names dont appear, gathering nodes just flicker blue/texureless if you move camera.. and if you hover over some players they just lose all their textures. Oh well :(
---
It's kind of fun to think of the legendary weapons showing up in other fictional settings. Also, I'll have a laugh at furries any day but sometimes the artists are actually genuinely amazeballs, like with this piece. To me it's a fantasy art piece featuring an anthro character, not just 'furry art lol'.

How do you fight with terrorism in these modern days then?
---
WoW i am sorry KISS fan boy  o/.
---

---
That doesn't work unless you're in open world. Even if it did, you can't negate the fall damage. The height is too much for even the fall damage trait :P
---
By not being threatened.
---
"for people who cannot read"? Maybe people would be able to read it, if it was written correctly and made sense. As far as I can fathom, "and see saying this didn't make much sense on the topic" is you saying "Everything I just said is irrelevant", so if that's what you meant, well, kudos to you, but it hardly stopped you from posting the comment as if you thought it still had merit.
---
It depends on your definition, but for me, a grind is when I have to do something repeatedly for something that I wouldn't normally do.
---
For instance, if I was zooming around a map just to farm platinum nodes, I consider that a grind.  But if in the course of doing map completion, dailies, whatever, I'm farming those same nodes, it's just part of playing the game.
---
So my view is to just try to get what you need by playing the game the way you want.  
---
Do you enjoy metas?  Personally, I do. So when I needed that currency, I made sure to do as many of the S4 metas as possible.  Really enjoyed the Specimen Chamber meta in SSI.
---
Do you WvW/PvP?  IF so, make sure to choose the reward track tied to the LW episode that has the currency you need, and the final chest will grant you 50 of that currency.
---
Be sure to snag the daily quests for extra currency and karma. You can usually get them while doing something else on the map at the same time.
---
Combat Healer
---
I love these two skins.
---
Don't play with me dude. You say "terrorists win terrorists won they will win then" in your every comment. Gimme a solution to win over them.
---
They won because people are afraid of mocking allah, while being happy with mocking jesus. I mock both.
---
&gt;Why is everything comes up to blowing up / gunning people down dude?
---
Because that's violence, which is no longer speech and is actually harming.  
---
&gt; Do you think all the muslims would gun people down or beat them to death when they hear something bad about Muhammed or God near them? 
---
No, but a scary amount of people would.  
---
&gt; You are generalizing all the muslim community as the potential terrorists and I don't feel comfortable with it. 
---
Muslims are strongly indoctrinated. Islam is a very violent religion. So yes, i see every muslim as a potential seed to grow into an extremist. Scary amounts of evidence leads me to think this way.  
---
&gt;  You may think christians should not be offended by these religious things but I don't think most of the christian people feel the same way as you 
---
Their feelings, just like muslim's feelings and your feelings are of no concern to me.  
---
&gt; Anet should be respectful about it is what I'm all saying. 
---
And i think Anet should not sway from whatever they want in regards to their naming policy due to brainwashed idiots who might use violence.
---
They'll die to the NPCs before entering the fight.

If you want to learn how to solo it, I recommend you start with guardian. It's my main class for a reason -- it's just insanely good and comfortable to play. I also recommend you go on a hunt and gather some of the most useful consumables from open world that work in dungeons, they make things a lot less of a pain! Harpy feathers, order of whisper spy kits, ash legion spy kits, and pot of hylek poison. After that it's just practice and practice!
---
Rebounding the shockwave?

You could do some collections.

You already have fiery greatsword. Unfortunately I doubt that elementalists will get any of their conjures as elite spec weapons

Applying your logic to this subreddit, I'd expect that only a couple thousand (is that the 1.5k doing skritt math?) regularly visit this site, so back to 1.9% we go.

I hate this use of language. It's such a warped view of reality. How about this: I just want to play with my friends, in my guild, which is a group of like minded players coming together to do stuff that they all enjoy. 
---
How would you like it if you went to out with all you friends and then had to start involving other people you don't know, who don't care about you, or know what you're doing. Like if you organized a game of basketball in the park with your friends and then a bunch of random teenagers started joining in without asking, and didn't know any of the rules. Wouldn't that suck?
---
Nothing to be envious about at all :D. Josh makes some awesome things though, should make sure to check out his twitch.tv/josh_foreman channel. Hes currently been making characters for his book covers.

Oh shoot hahaha. The reward of a lifetime of trolling.

Thanks for your hard work.

---
I put 300-400 just for the cpu, since I assumed there was an Intel cpu in that price that could be worth for GW2, but it seems amd is now an investiment if you do something else other gw2. Thank you to everybody do the answers
---
Which is just insane since Anet did spend so much money on trying to force GW2 esports to be a thing at the very beginning.
---
I tested a few days ago the previous version in Dragonfall during meta events and sometimes my CPU and GPU usage dropped to extremely low levels (near 0%, according to MSI Afterburner), freezing my screen for a few seconds when it happened.
---
Didn't gain much fps, but didn't tested in other maps.
---
But, i'll give this version a spin anytime soon to check it out.
---
U fly awesome already! D:
---
Anet never had big numbers or was popular as an eSport, I don't know where you're getting that from. All it had was Anet believing they could just toss money at eSports without any other support, resulting in a failure that shocked not a single damn person in the community.
---
Thank you a lot! I started with GW2 again just cause I wanted the griffon xD
---
But chances are Engi gets next GS spec
---
So far 2 Heavy classes 2 Ligh classes and 1 medium class can equip GS
---
So IMO Medium is getting the next GS
---
Ranger already can do it which leaves either Engi or Thief
---
I'm not gonna argue with you on whether or not Islam is violent.  
---
I know it is and i won't take: "No it's not" for an answer.  
---
I only need one prime example to make a point, which is to try and leave the Islam. Pew Research Center did an inquiry about muslims and their opinions. The majority of muslims share the opinion that leaving Islam should be punishable by execution. In places like Egypt, Pakistan and Afghanistan this is around 70%.   
---
Think about that for a second. 70% of muslims living in Egypt, Pakistan and Afghanistan feel that people should be executed for stepping out of a religion. That's over 250 million people in those three countries alone.  
---
Of the western muslims, only about 3% on average share this opinion. Which still, considering how many western muslims there are is an insane amount. Russia has about 20 million muslims living there. That's 600 people who have this messed up idea that killing people for leaving their religion is fine and dandy!   
---
And as Brigitte Gabriel said; "The vast majority are irrelevant".
---
you just say bingo.

Put fith skill from medkit in lightning fields and blast and leap through fields to maintain superspeed, quickness, and vigor. Otherwise use highest dps skills after you have popped superspeed, quickness, stability and vigor. Thunderclap, spare capacitor, shredder, electrowhirl. You get nearly permanent quickness from this, which will let you pull ahead of almost everyone except for reapers in fractals if they aren't built to cover themselves. You can also face tank stuff with your barrier generation.
---
This in fractals with support,

You aren't a real dps spec so with support you will fall behind. Still fun. replace exilier U with whatever you want.

Your warrior spec- I think that is really cool, I am a warrior main with most of my 5k hours on warrior and I think that another possible option is (specialization name commander) and double up on shouts to a boon warrior. I think if this were the case we would probably get staff.

Gaurdian- I think that would be a little boring but it seems likely  :/

Rev- THAT IS THE COOLEST SPEC IDEA I HAVE EVER HEARD AND NEED IT TO HAPPEN NOW.

Engi- I would still love to see a Hawkeye, green arrow Esqe longbow ranger.
---
Theif- I like the idea for theif torch but I really really want a spec that stealths and then does HUGE smack them over the head numbers. 
---
Elementalist- I had never considered pistol ele and think it would be really cool. I would hope it is a condi  spec though.
---
Necro- Hammer would probably be better. I really like the idea of a with doctor type spec running around with my sword and focus though. 
---
Mesmer- I dont think I would like hammer mesmer, I think hammer may be a little to clunky for the mesmer aesthetic.

Is there some special event going on in HoT maps right now?

It does, doesn't it? The thing is I did a few benchmarks and the only thing that came out a bit lower than the average was the CPU everything else seems to be fine. Voltages are also perfectly fine. So before buying a new power supply, I might just format this thing since over the years I installed a LOT of shit.

You can always counter any kind of "grind" in any situation by careful planning and splitting it up in smaller repeatable tasks.
---
Anet makes this approach sadly pretty grindy feeling due to the stupid timegated rewards. In older mmos you could split up everything in task-sizes suited to yourself, Anet however likes to think they know best for their players and split it up for them - like parents cutting food for their children even though they already can do it for themselves.
---
Thats why totally normal mmo progression feels so damn grindy in this game.

The last underwater weapon to enter the game (as far as I know) was with the [Bandit weapon set](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bandit_weapons), which came with the [Silverwastes back in November 2014](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Echoes_of_the_Past). Harrier was released with A Bug in the System in March 2018, so underwater weapons had been dead for 4 years at that point. You should still be able to stat change an ascended underwater weapon to whatever stat set you'd like (or use a gen1 legendary, as there are no gen2 underwater legendaries).
---
Looking forward to it
---
lmao I love it when people have funny names for this event

He is part of a guild called Storfleet Dongtails. They are run by a guild leader named Wake N Bake Beeman and a co leader Swiss Nigh. A lot of their members are not very funny but they have great taste it character names and outfits. I hear they also charge a lot of gems for membership as Wake N Bake require a gem tithe.
---
My favourite name I've seen in game was a ranger named Strongbow Darkfruit. If that wasn't the name of a cider, it would be absolutely perfect for a ranger.
---
most profitable time to gold is probably TP flipping, a few seconds to click and vuahlah, gold. But repeatable farm is silverwaste. It doesnt mean you should avoid doing the daily capped ways to make gold tho. Still do them first and if you have leftover time, goto silverwaste.
---
GPU utilisation stays between 15-40%. Only during the initial loading it spiked to 75% for a short time. I'd say those are some more reliable values.

Nice. Whats that item beside astralia?

Not a clue, I hope the upcoming champion rush will have something similar.

It may encounter a different workload then it does in other game scenario,s which can trigger it to throttle down due to heat issues. What temps are you getting just before it downclocks?  
---
It could also be because the CPU load is increased on that map due to specific workloads which then bottleneck your GPU and it decides to clock down.
---
only spear, none of the other underwater weapons? or was spear just as an example
---
It had a redbull.

None.

I’d settle for afk auto 1 people getting booted if they use no other skill for 2 minutes(without moving or dodging)
---
It typed "flying mount" into the reddit search bar and learnt how to glide from one of the thousand search results.
---
That the real point. Most players are just going to play another profession or leave the game when their prof and build gets sledgehammer nerfed beyond reason, leaving only the happy whiners who caused the nerfs in the first place to be happy about the changes, despite not even playing the profession themselves. Not to mention how massive changes to a class randomly throughout an expansions lifetime screws with so many players both long time vets and casuals they will just give up and look for entertainment elsewhere when their voices are never heard, only mocked.
---
Oh yeah, big dark forests with huge trees in the snow, something like that fractal! Would be so amazing.
---
Yeah, he returned. Then got sent back lol
---
&gt; Don't buy fractal keys (just sell the encryptions)
---
30 relics a day is not a deal breaker for getting to fractal god. Selling those extra 30 encryptions nets you less gold than opening.
---
At least you're having fun :D
---
dont spoilll mee i havent finished shadowbringers yeeeet
---
lol okay so an anet dev posts in a thread about dungeons, but its obviously so far fetched that maybe they know things about dungeons. okay, where exactly and what exactly does Jonanet do at arenanet, since you must obviously have the exact answer to that question, please tell me so i can feel as smart as you are
---
nice xD
---
WHAT? *cracks knuckles*
---
I know what my next character is.
---
Concerning the FB kit, it indeed is pretty stacked. However, there is one key difference to abominations like the old boonshare (chaos) chrono: you can't keep up everything at the same time. You obviously do quickness and rather frequent aegis. Fury is still easy to cover, but all the rest will come at the expense of something, be it all your dps or uptime of other boons. Stuff like resistance is heavily restricted anyway. In the utility department, again stuff almost always comes at the expense of something else and quite a bit of it is crap. I'd instantly trade all FB pulls for the chrono focus pull.
---
This doesn't mean that FB isn't OP. It probably is, at least on an absolute scale. But in its current PvE environment, this is a relatively minor issue. Imbalances in the past were much, much worse.
---
A Jedi then, after all.
---
Practice makes perfect and thank you!

---
Thanks so much everyone for the nice comments. :3 Can't reply to all before reddit rate limits me, but I appreciate everyone's comment. &lt;3
---
Might I interest you in some portals?
---
Thanks for the reply but I meant the yellow ones by the Grove that are also angry looking pumpkins. I made a new 
---
Sylvari and I just noticed that while running around between different markers like the POIs or hearts there are these yellow pumpkin ones but I don't know what they were supposed to represent. Do they just mean there are monsters nearby or something?
---
Which 3 amal do you do? I assume AB &amp; Pinata, what's the other one?
---
Don't forget to charge a quartz crystal everyday
---
These are markers available during the Halloween festival, these are the spots where will be pumpkins to be destroyed during the festival. To no longer see them, just deactivate the markers in the section "Festivals&gt; Halloween"  
---
When they will be there you will be able to see this

Lupi was great, one of the very few classic bosses actually worthy of being called a boss.
---
If you can find exotic weapons that allow for stat selection, you can use those.  The rare Bandit weapons from the Silverwastes that were mentioned in another reply can work, you can give them Harrier stats, but they're still only rares and won't be as strong as an exotic.
---
After some digging, I've found that the Gold Fractal Weapons are exotics that have selectable stats.  Underwater weapons are available from that set.  That might not be easy for you to get, but if you've done fractals and have the needed components available, that's something you can look into rather than going for Ascended.  Of course, with the cost of them, you might just rather go Ascended anyway.
---
Filling out the [Equip meant query](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:RunQuery/Equipment_query) on the gw2 wiki shows you can get harriers underwater weapons from the [Golden fractal weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gold_Fractal_Harpoon) or from the [mistforge heros weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistforged_Hero%27s_Spear#item1)

baymax jigglebutt ahoy
---
yeah not done fractals.. or dungeons or anything not open world yet, so i think i am going to keep saving up materials to make ascended stuff.. with armor and weapons and underwater weapons etc it's hard to know where to start so i am just making the daily crafting materials as i go until i can decide, right now i just get 80 exotic stuff..managed to get harrier's warbeast armor because the bounty hunter looked so hard to get having to wait like 6 days to get the full set from the historian, harrier's weapons was easy enough with mordent stuff.. but jewellery was impossible i mean there isn't even any magi's exotic jewellery you can make which seems weird or even just regular healing

Not OP but this is all I could get. https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/98d10o/does_anybody_else_hope_the_six_human_gods_will/e4g07ih/?context=10000

interesting because i think last week it was working as me and my raid group did it 2 times in the same week. but with the most recent patch the cliff trick to spawn glennas attack party on the ledge and get them stuck on the ledge doesnt work as easily now so i was wondering if it was stealth patched will have to do more testing.
---
There was a big fuss about someone with the character name "Satan" I think (post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3wsxb7/)), and ANET changed the rule. As long as it's not derogatory or something like... Jesus Murders Children.
---
&gt;Have we truly seen the last of them? Only time will tell.
---
Thanks. That line doesn't scream to me that it is a burning hanging plot thread in their minds, just something that might be touched on later.
---
&gt; Not having access to the source code should always cause a healthy level of paranoia (the people in charge are actively hiding it from you) and should absolutely always be complained about by the users.
---
While I'm certainly a proponent of the concept of open source software, it's important to realise two things:
---
Firstly it's a myth that open source software is safer or anything like that. Sometimes yes, sometimes no — it just depends. Lots of open source software is poorly maintained and/or poorly checked. Yes, a knowledgeable user has the ability to check, and compile themselves, but for larger projects it's an illusion to think that even if you have the theoretical skill to do so, you'd be willing, or have the time, to do that for every piece of software you want to use. On the flip side, closed source projects often have incentives to keep the code maintained and trustworthy for commercial reasons.
---
Plenty of exceptions — on either side.
---
Secondly, the more software would be open source, the thinner the 'force' of people able and willing to check and maintain will be spread, which will automatically result in an overall degradation of quality.
---
In short, closed source software is _not_ evil as such, and needs to exist for practical reasons alone.
---
Needless to say though, OP's project is a prime example of a tool where openness is vastly preferred :-)
---
Apparently this dude's had it for a while. Could've fooled me considering ANet's policy
---
that is 1k trinkets you can craft now... GO CRASH THE MARKET :D
---
I have a fondness for calling the Masquerade one a butt mullet...WHY DO SO MANY SKIRTS HAVE THE FRONT PANEL CUT OUT??? Knock it off Anet. 
---
Loooove the new outfit, I dont usually buy them but this one was an instant buy.

But with less annoying enemies

That is some weird necrophilia o.O

awwww LOVE IT!!!
---
still waiting to see a "Far King Knut" toon made and doppleganger'd
---
Thats currently available on the shop not all the gemstore items?
---
No, the truth is far worse than you may imagine. It's all void under the skirt. ALL! VOID! The animation of legs moving the skirt is actually tentacles moving under it. Anything that goes under the skirt is never heard from again. It is the price one pays to look that good.

If it is just for guildwars 2 I would suggest the r5 3600 or i5 9400f.  The r5 is 6 core 12 threads while the i5 9400f is just 6 core.  The perform pretty much the same in games, trading blows between different titles.  As the i5 9400f is cheaper it is likely to offer more frames per dollar spent, but again, that will depend on the specific titles being examined.
---
In comparing any production tasks, the r5 will obliterate the i5 in everything.
---
An R7 3700x or 3800x is within your budget but their performance in guildwars will only be slightly better than the other processors mentioned and will cost 2x the price.
---
I would choose the r5 over the i5 because of the extra threads.  Having more power doesn't hurt, even if guildwars can't utilize it.  You never know when you might need it and the price premium to get the extra threads isn't to expensive.
---
Praise Jormag!
---
I see someone has been playing ff14 :)
---
And btw, it's actually documented on GW2Radial Github page, under "FAQ (5 question)":
---
* **Q: I want to load up ArcDPS/GW2Hook/something else which also needs to be called d3d9.dll, how do I load both?**  
---
 [https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Radial#faq](https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Radial#faq)
---
They could let us go in and explore it Tomb Raider style, searching for ancient arcane knowledge that Joko may have accumulated over the years. 
---
It doesn't even have to require access to the Kourna map, we could go there directly from another map with the new gateless portals developed by Taimi and Blish during S4 based on Inquest technology.
---
You can even talk with Ninn about them.
---
&gt; Commander &gt; I saw portals a lot like the Awakeneds' being used for a festival. Explain.   
---
&gt; Ninn &gt;  I heard the Arcane Council has a renewed interest in quick-setup portals. The ones you've seen require an on-site beacon and specialist during setup, and are safe to use.
---
Nah, let's move on. It's not that important of a location, and we've had enough desert for now.
---
Considering the trends, if they keep progressing, religious people will be a minority eventually. 
---
Maybe one day we'll get to the levels of the Earth in The Orville.
---
Are you out of your mind? Do you know how many times I had to go there just for elite skills? Well no more!
---
How many years of subs is that?
---
It doesn't have to require previous episodes if they make it it's own instance. I'm talking a new and restored Gandara, which we visit for whatever reason as part of an episode. Heck, even as part of current events.
---
Kind of. There's legs from the knees down piercing through the bottom of the dress, which is a flat horizontal surface at the height of the shins.
---
So it's a bit similar to the noble count outfit, but the flat void is higher and there's more leg visible.
---
They could come up with any number of excuses. It's a cool, important, interesting landmark.
---
Well, it's what happens when you make episodes free to access for only a limited time. They have, however, shown a willingness to again offer the episodes for free if changes are made - for instance, the episode was made free again for people to get the beetle for the racing event.
---
That is listed in gold and not gems (the gem cost is around 300,000), and it should be reasonably accurate since gw2efficiency should list everything unlockable, though it wasn't showing me the gathering tool prices for some reason.
---
I mean, little late for that. I guarantee that at least Episode 1 through 3 are well into development.
---
Most of the time they are inventing excuse how to NOT do things instead.
---
Some gemstore items can be earned in game as well. Such as Panda was 400 gems at one point.
---
you said yourself on your stream (I watched it) that you do it to keep the partnership with anet, that make you, and I quote again from your stream, "not a unsignificant amount of money". 
---
**you** dont want to lose your partnership. I didnt made that up ffs. you are either lying about it or just mock your community at this point.
---
Well sometimes you need to hop over a rock or something but want to immediately use #2 to rush, and you might get that prompt from trying to equip it mid-air. Then there is a delay of an extra second before it lets you equip the bundle. Here is the prompt you get when you try with the novelty keybind: http://puu.sh/E5CNN.jpg
---
That prompt will not happen if it's just using the item from your inventory.
---
Believe it or not despite the amount of stargazer pendant drops, wraithlord chains, and p4 recipe drops I've seen... I have not once ever gotten a p2 recipe drop. Just a fun fact.
---
About 20 if you say a sub is $15
---
Why the next living story looks to be about Jormag and maybe Primordus what ties do they have to those dragons. They could make Gandara a fractal or a raid sure but as for main story stuff it makes no sense.
---
Yeah not an important location lets just ignore the fact its where Varesh conjured hell demons, it has the plaza of the six, its where Kormir lost her eyes and is one of the most important story locations of GW1 as its the first part of the war between Kourna and Istan.
---
What class did you play in WoW? Some of the first-impressions of GW2 classes aren't how they work at endgame, so it helps knowing what you like first.
---
How do you know it makes no sense if you know nothing about the upcoming arc? lol...
---
I am new to GW2 having left an MMO I invested a lot of years in a couple months ago. Frankly all these posts by discontented people are getting a little old. 
---
This is the first time I have commented but I felt I had to say this :
---
*Oh my.... a business which exists to make a profit. Income which is used to pay devs and artists and keep the servers turned on. How outrageous!!!*
---
What is actually wrong with these people?
---
Dungeons might help with that starting at level 30, or you can just jump straight into PvP since gear is normalized and you get tomes of knowledge which you can convert to levels
---
"Muh small raid room is enuf fo muh weekly casual potty" -phoenix
---
Do you open the blues and greens or do you just salvage the stacks?
---
What's wrong with choosing the name?
---
Whats Jormag got to do with Elona or Primordus. Like I said a fractal or raid sure but if we are going after a dragon in the Far Shiverpeaks and a Dragon underground last time in Draconis Mons as we can see after going down the volcano in episode 5 of season 3 it makes no story sense. Also we have had 3 years of Elona if I'm honest they missed a step with Gandara they could have had us get there the same way as in GW1 and we take the fight to Joko that way.
---
If you’re trying to level to 80 together, don’t get caught up on the hearts. they’re on of the many ways to get experience in open world. Do things like dynamic events, dungeons, world bosses, dailies for tones of knowledge, put on exp boosters. 
---
You can get to 80 without doing any hearts. My advice would be to do the hearts that seem fun, and do other fun open world stuff and the personal story. You can also gain lots of tomes from pvp, which you can do from level 2 onwards.
---
Yes you can buy individual episodes if you want to. No need to own or play previous episodes
---
&gt;So I went to GW2efficiency and loocked at the gold value of all the gem related stuff
---
8250 is the gold value, which is somewhere around 30k gems (don't know how gw2efficiency specifically converts)
---
&gt;Christianity took more lives than any other religion in history of human kind
---
[Timur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur) would like to register a complain. I'd mention neo-paganism and 20th century god-kings to balance things out but that would be an obvious Godwin.
---
Yes, it is possible. Go to your hero panel (*H* is the default key) -&gt; Story journal -&gt; LS3 -&gt; Pick an episode -&gt; Buy for 200 gems.
---
In other words, just go to whichever living season tab you want, click on the episode of your choice and you should have the button "Buy for 200gems". You don't necessarily have to buy the ep 1 to buy the ep 2, so you can buy ep 2 without having ep 1 beforehand.
---
&gt;Firstly it's a myth that open source software is safer or anything like that.
---
Open source doesn't inherently make anything more secure.  
---
The thing is, neither does closed source.
---
&gt;Lots of open source software is poorly maintained and/or poorly checked.
---
Correct.  
---
However Open Source doesn't exist in a vacuum, the only alternative, closed source software, will be even more poorly maintained and/or checked given conditions are the same otherwise.   
---
Unlike OSS, there is next to no possibility of closed source software to be randomly checked by third parties (especially not the kind of third party that aims to improve, not abuse) because the code is in a practically unreadable format.
---
&gt; Yes, a knowledgeable user has the ability to check, and compile themselves, but for larger projects it's an illusion to think that even if you have the theoretical skill to do so, you'd be willing, or have the time, to do that for every piece of software you want to use.
---
Even if you had the ability to, while still somewhat possible, it's not easy to do *at all* with closed source software compared to open source software.  
---
If closed a source software has CVEs or bugs, your options are to suck it because you couldn't realistically fix it yourself even if you had the ability to fix such things because you don't have access to the human readable code for the software.
---
OSS is obviously not optimal in this regard (unless it's Free aswell, don't think there's a better model than that) but still much better than closed source.
---
&gt;On the flip side, closed source projects often have incentives to keep the code maintained and trustworthy for commercial reasons.
---
Commercial backing has absolutely nothing to do with openess of the source code, that is completely unrelated.   
---
Being closed source very often correlates with commercial backing but as everyone should know, correlation does not imply causation.  
---
Just because projects with commercial backing tend to produce closed source software, doesn't mean that producing closed source software causes commercial backing.  
---
Similarly, just because a software is open source it doesn't cause it to not have commercial backing.
---
&gt;the more software would be open source, the thinner the 'force' of people able and willing to check and maintain will be spread, which will automatically result in an overall degradation of quality.
---
But if all that open source software was closed source software instead the 'force' would magically be less thin spread?  
---
That doesn't make sense.  
---
&gt;In short, closed source software is *not* evil as such, and needs to exist for practical reasons alone.
---
You, as a user, gain absolutely nothing (not even indirectly to any degree of significance) but you will certainly lose.
---
If I had the choice between 'good' or 'evil', I, as a user, would label that as 'evil'.
---
I believe you're under the false assumption that closed source software has to be Free software (people wrongfully use these terms interchangebly).  
---
I can certainly see that there are reasons why someone with commercial interests would prefer their open source software to be non-free (to protect IP, copyright, keep their monopoly or whatever) but even those might not always be worth losing out on the advantages of Free software (btw can you tell me which of these reasons would benefit the user in any way shape or form?).  
---
Free software is a different topic though.
---
thank u for supporting the game lol, but black lion chests are designed to prey on addictive behaviors, be careful
---
I mained Paladin PVE, Mage PVP, but I'm honestly open to new classes &amp; mechanics.
---
i savage the whole thong :)
---
There is nothing wrong with using staff as a weaver unless your trying to optimize for like a raiding scenario in which case it could matter but anything besides high end fractals and some raids is the only time it would matter.
---
But then they made Joko a fucking joke so maybe it’s better if story going forward doesn’t touch any GW1 locations- they would likely be ruined with the lighthearted, always have solutions to every problem story line set forth
---
short answer: no. you can use whatever weapons you want as all the basic ele weapons got a dual skill in slot 3 regardless of combination.
---
Lmao what?
---
It was important in GW1, sure. But beyond that, it's really not that significant. Shame that it was not done in time, but no point in forcing the story very unnaturally back to Elona.
---
Oooh I want a great sword theif!
---
Yeah but I value the tokens more than gold so I would never craft them :P
---
Thanks will do :D

That's how I actually played the game, I got tired of walking around doing hearts and vistas so I just PVP'd once I got familiar with the game and now I have loads of extra tomes sitting around. And most of my money came from flipping items on the market, 90% of the items I flipped I didn't even know what they were used for. Unfortunately I didn't know anyone and didn't get around to do doing any fractals or raids, or any hard PVE content for that matter.
---
As for the issues with my friends, I think they just did a few days of exploration and got burnt out. I wouldn't say that got good enough to enjoy PVP so if we were to make a rough plan on what I should take them out to do... Levels 1-30 do exploration, 30+ do dungeons, do the occasional world boss and dynamic event, or? I just need some direction towards the fast-paced content, like suggestions for when to do what content to get to the meat and potatoes of the game.
---
I'd like for them to be able to jump into PVP but I think that'll take some time. Do you have a rough timeline of levels and content we should do that is primarily fast-paced? Like say do hearts/dynamic events to 30, 30+ do dungeons, etc.? That'd be much appreciated.
---
Why is this NSFW?
---
I bought blc to get the exchange vouchers and all I got was the starborn and raptor skin back to back after 5 opens :/
---
I continue to be unclear why we aren't just putting every son of svanir we can find to the sword and burning down their enclave.
---
Yeah, yeah, I know, the Norn have this cultural thing of not blaming all of a group for the actions of others. Sure. Fine. They're still a death cult serving Hoelbrak's definitive enemy. It'd be like the Risen hanging out in Divinity's Reach telling people how kickass Zhaitan is to serve, back when that was a thing.
---
I got it from a map completion key yesterday so it should be.
---
First we got orr full of dead and undead.
---
For a change, we got a jungle full of deadly life. 
---
Another change and we ended up in a desert, hot and arid.
---
We have enough so next zones are icy mountains and freezing cold!
---
I expect fire and lava after, then water expansion!
---
Yes. You can buy each episode directly from the journal, but it's more expensive to get them one by one that way than buying the season bundles.
---
I think you meant to say "Income which is used to line the pockets of CEO's and shareholders".
---
A blue mini asura from the 1st collection, 2,45 silver value :P
---
I've always found the most success with using GW2 Launch buddy. Add the DLLs to its plugin manager and it will handle the rest.
---
what a beauty
---
A Fractal perhaps?
---
it never goes abover 60 degrees. and workload is 30% in eb
---
Or a raid (although that'd be kinda boring). Anything disconnected from main story would work.
---
Entire turret mechanic.. there is just no reason to use it. Only teleport turret really useful for some hearts and thats it. 
---
Entire meta should be expanded, added next phase after it, where you really want to use turrets.
---
I mean... It should matter that playing casually vs expertly doesn't bring much difference in the overall performance of a class when it comes down to performing its main function (boons in this instance).
---
I never felt like I had to try hard to get anything good out of the old chrono, which is why I think the nerfs are good.
---
If you want to select whose opinion matters, you're not looking for a discussion, you're looking for an echo chamber.
---
&gt;For those of you out of the loop, a full Gandara experience was supposed to be featured during Long Live the Lich episode
---
Maybe someone thought it might be a cool idea if they could do that in concept, but it clearly got scrapped early in development. Those assets are purely there so that your top-down map shows their roofs and paints the path winding between them.
---
[See for yourself](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/4/4d/Gandara%2C_the_Moon_Fortress_map.jpg). And take note of the piers that aren't even connected to the land, as well as the jagged shoreline. The assets are only there to paint a flaky illusion.
---
Yup, the third is VB Matriarch.
---
&gt; easier to run than Auric Basin
---
The thing about AB is that you don't need to run it at all, just log in in before :30 on a completed map, and loot a Grand Chest.
---
I'm pretty sure everyone has had a Tarir like this if you've done it more than 10 times.
---
You call that a hassle? I'll let you know I was already hunting elite skills in tyria when you actually had to effing INTERRUPT the boss with the signet of capture when he used the actual elite skill to capture it. Now THAT was pure torture. Post-2005 "teabag dead boss with signet" elite hunting is for filthy casuals.
---
The game's very alt-friendly, to the point that you can make new 80's in a couple of hours eventually. You'll be able to try everything out, it was just easier for me to learn on classes with familiar ideas.
---
Greatsword guardians feel like old Ret paladins but smoother, and their elite specs offer higher burst or aoe-farming. They're one of the best healers in the game for group content, too. Don't expect longbow to do much for them, though.
---
Auramancer tempest is the closest you can get to a frost mage, with a lot of area slows and damage, but elementalists have lots of options including melee with daggers (and swords as weaver), too.
---
Engineers in core can only use rifles, pistols, and shields - but their rifle skills work more like shotguns, the turrets are almost completely useless, and their endgame builds mostly work like close-range brawlers. They're fine at that, just don't look at the ranged list and expect to use rifles like rifles (I did. Oops.)
---
Mesmers... after the last round of chronomancer irritation I just gave up on the class. There's certainly nothing else like them elsewhere, but they're very obnoxious to play unless you go Mirage, so I wouldn't recommend those as a starter class.
---
Keep in mind the level 80 boosts will let you take any class to an end-game zone and play with (with core content only, no expansion skill trees) them as long as you like, with the option to revert or keep the boost as soon as you leave the zone. It's a no-risk trial for every class, might as well take advantage of that.
---
i love scourge it is op class in smart guy &lt;3 . and i pray what you said will be a true fresh breathe to the game
---
The issue is when players think the content is being sidelined to grab more money, at the cost of actually making content. 
---
The point is that the game companies try to make money and players set the boundaries for what is acceptable and what is not. There's little point in saying "oh they need to make money"; that's a completely useless statement that everyone agrees on and misses the whole point of the argument.
---
You may be happy with the state of monetization as I am fine with playing some other games with more aggressive monetization. That said I'll respect long time players looking out for their interests (and mine as a result), them knowing the direction the company and game is going far better than I do as a newcomer.
---
lol
---
damm this comment are the harsh so far :p
---
I am not one to say if it was late or early in dev, but I think the harder part was already done. It just needs the buildings moved around in a coherent way and some other things. I remember it was mentioned the meta went inside the fortress, but that got scrapped.
---
Is the song Toxic by Brittney Spears?
---
Yeah. That works relatively well. I wasn't able to run taco though...
---
Wait Coeur de Pirate did music for a video game? Well I learned something today
---
You fool! You try to impress me with that forgetting that nightfall released after that! HA!
---
That's about $45 a month assuming you never convert gold to gems.
---
Thats why you need designated people for it. And it might be only me but as far as I'm aware, unless they use pms, here on reddit devs rarely get any shit. 
---
No communication at all is not the way, it generates more toxicity and leaves the players uneasy.
---
or maybe woodlands after icy mountains, we didn't get that since lake doric. we will probably have lava stuff this season too, since jormag's weakness is primordus
---
Yep, if you're going to do that, then Junundu Rising and Forged with Fire aren't as fast.  But they're still faster than Tangled Depths, Serpent's Ire, Dragon's Stand, Maws of Torment (less buggy, too) and the Path to Ascension.
---
My only real complaint is the visually bad looking inner dress. Instead of modelling the interior of the dress at the legs, they just filled it in so that you can't see above the calf.
---
It really looks ugly when swimming or jumping.

How does it look while gliding?

So dumb too. The rule they use to justify these killings applies to all the prophets, not just Muhammad. You never see them freak out over the millions of depictions of Jesus(also a prophet in Islam). Killing over false idolatry, but walk around and worship towards a piece of meteor, seems a bit contradictory.
---
You crazy Jesus!  YOU CRAZAAY!
---
Staff Weaver is very good. Scepter and Sword are great, too. The only one that I think is lacking personally is Dagger, but that doesn't mean you can't play it and do well with it.
---
Why? Jesus is also a prophet in Islam.
---
gw2timer has gem costs for past and current items (and "what you need to unlock all of it")
---
Currently it looks bit like (prices in gems):
---
Back items: 19 150
---
Hats: 15 206
---
Armor: 11 205
---
Most expensive weapon-category: AXES with 4 200. Rest are 3k-ish. No underwater weapons tho, wonder why.
---
Minis: 26 736 
---
Outfits: 38 100 + 6 300 festival ones
---
Gliders: 27 200
---
And theres even more stuff (like salvage kits).. So thats about 143 897 gems so far. If 800 gems is $10 then thats what? $1 800 rounded up?
---
Damnit, you're right.
---
Fufu Cuddlypoofs it is.
---
its called: a joke.
---
its because gold also had silver/copper. it is a limitation of the system, it'll just be a 32 bit integer, so 2,147,483,647, which is then rounded to 2,000,000,000 copper, and therefore 200,000g
---
I hate to be the one to break it to you, but...
---
Joko was a joke in Guild Wars 1.
---
His Awakened didn't listen to him.  He fought against Mad King Thorn as a Hallowe'en activity and lost.  His scariest appearance in that first game was when he showed up in the Akuma role during the Street Fighter tournament, replacing M. Bison as the final boss.  But just the context of that makes it a joke anyway.
---
Rose-tinted glasses are not the best way to view the world.
---
If I have option A that does a better job and saves me effort and time over option B, I think it's perfectly logical and reasonable I'll go for A.
---
You're making so many retarded assumptions and you misinterpret so many things I say, I'm not even gonna dignify this drivel with a proper response.
---
You're right, closed source equals evil. Enjoy being a mindless zealot.

["Blizzard Criticized for Job Post Tied to Recent Layoffs"](https://gamerant.com/blizzard-job-post-layoff/)
---
This is more about the whole layoffs but yeah, e-sports team got shafted. Specially the whole Heroes of the storm fiasco. oof.
---
&gt; Early in 2019, Activision Blizzard reportedly laid off more than 800 employees, 8% of its workforce.  
---
&gt; Kotick made the announcement shortly after confirming that Activision [Blizzard had "achieved record results in 2018](https://gamerant.com/activision-blizzard-layoff-sales-2018/)" amounting to $7.5 Billion in sales and $1.8 Billion profit.   
---
&gt; One team hit particularly hard by the layoffs was [*Hearthstone*'s community management team](https://gamerant.com/blizzard-layoff-209/) due to the card game's waning popularity and foundering esports scene     
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Watchful eyes have noticed that Blizzard recently posted a job listing for a *Hearthstone* Community Manager, the same position which saw multiple layoffs just a matter of months ago
---
fireheart rise South West corner or timberline falls East
---
You nailed it..
---
There is an event in the SW corner of Fireheart Rise where a single NPC convinces the crawl that a statue is talking.
---
3-5 target limit.  Enemies are at least 2 levels higher than what level you're set at there and there's about 10-15 of them.
---
Two are generally like this.
---
I think the one you're looking for is in the Northeast part of Timberline Falls, where an Asura (inquest?) is messing with the local grawl.
---
A similar event has an order of whispers guy making the voice for the head in southwest Fireheart Rise, again manipulating the local grawl.
---
Why didn't I think of that!? You're a genius!
---
3 words: Bring it on!
---
Do asura have scales?
---
They're chugging the hatorade cuz of my awesome naming skills
---
Your funeral.
---
how else would they measure the sheer weight of their brains?
---
The first one is it. Thank you so much :-D At the Ogduk waypoint.  
---
Many thanks for fast answering.  
---
Thanks to the others to for answering this quick. I will check them out too.  
---
Cheers all :-)
---
Event chain starts with [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defeat_the_grawl_commander).
---
That is the event you are looking for.
---
Well the issue is not really what someone may believe in or even what they believe may be worth of killing for. The issue is whether someone will try to kill you or one of your customer and whether you are ready to die / sacrifice a customer over it.
---
'What someone is ready to kill for, you have to know if you are willing to die for.'
---
Some matters you just aren't. Games for example.
---
To be honest some fine  people in 'our civilized society' are becoming almost ready to kill other people over non-religious matters as well (as long as they believe they have a high enough moral ground).
---
Hubris often uses religion to satiate over human lives but when religion has been rendered useless it finds other means.
---
Thank you it was in Timberline Falls indeed. Not so starting area as i remember :-)
---
Yeah Thank you too for helping out. Now i must wait for the event to have a laugh :)  
---
Cheers

&gt;Suspicious Travelers

\^ is true. Female Norn followers of Jormag likely exist, but are well hidden because the Sons of Svanir slaughter any they know about.

Just try a bit of everything with them and see what they like. There’s loads of maps too, so if they get bored of the map they started in, the waypoint for the other starting zones are automatically unlocked.
---
EVILLLLLL i till you E V I L
---
Ok
---
Sweet, thanks for the tip :-))
---
Oh i gotta check these out too them. I play for 5 years and i guess i rushed them too fast.  
---
Thanks :-))))
---
Cringe
---
Phew, it's not just me....
---
&gt;You're making so many retarded assumptions and you misinterpret so many things I say
---
Which would be?
---
&gt;You're right, closed source equals evil.
---
I haven't heard a single valid argument (as in no logical errors, no factual fallacies etc.) for why it shouldn't be and brought a few for why it is at least more "evil" than open source.   
---
There is no other logical conclusion to make at that point in time.
---
&gt;Enjoy being a mindless zealot.
---
In case you run out of arguements, insult. Big brain discussion.
---
Jormag's known weakness. Nothing saying that we don't discover another. Personally I'm hoping for something different because a "two birds one stone" solution for elder dragons feels a bit cheap.
---
Usually you will prefer Monk on the Healbrand and to put Pack on the Diviner Alacrity Renegade.
---
Big **YIKES**
---
[In the name of the father, the son and the HOLY SHI-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryVOwDWOzN0&amp;t=27s)
---
I don't know. If worshipping a ruler like in 4000 BC counts as religion, if anything the numbers are steady.
---
If believing in The Grand Illusion (aka the economy as ruled by petaflop computers) counts then we are more religious than ever.
---
If having a vision of cosmic balance, an end of the world which draws near and a huge list of 'do this don't do that' to avoid the Great Fire counts as religion then climate says hi.
---
This would be great. Remake the Consulate Docks mission as a fractal. Get to see the interior of the fortress in GW2, get to see an important event from the first game, and more fractals which is always a good thing in my book.
---
You sound like my ex wife.
---
What's the origin of this?
---
Map art is not the "harder part". There is a ton of different things that go into developing content like this and to simplify it down to just art is nonsensical. And, like foozledaa said, even the map art was clearly not done, so how any sort of "harder part" could have been completed already just isn't possible.
---
Yes, that's real life buddy. Small guys make money for big guys.
---
This may be a silly question, but why is he dressed like Macho Man Randy Savage?
---
Heres the thing.  Through the whole conversation, you constantly keep comparing gw2 to a game that existed 5 years ago (gw2 5 years ago).  You use terms like, 'better' instead of, 'good'.  And I think there is a reason for that. Because compared to modern games that gw2 is competing with right now, it isn't good.  At best, average, neither good nor bad.  
---
I started playing before season 2.  I don't know the exact time.  I was super into dungeons and I know how annoying the loot system was back then.  But if Anet is going to devote so many resources into improving this aspect of the game, 'better' isn't the goal. 'Good' is the goal.  And I wouldn't rank gw2's reward system as good.
---
I did it.
---
I just did the event:)) I don't want to know how many pre's i've missed in these 5 years.  
---
It was fun doing along until i met the champion and died ;-)
---
apparently some streamer (or chat of some streamer) started this thing.
---
Just another reason to stay away from the Twitch streamers of GW2.
---
Why would I stay away from memes?
---
FILTHY CASUAL!!111
---
\*is totally innocent, too\*
---
&gt; the content is being sidelined to grab more money
---
Which isn't even a thing. The store team is completely separate from the content-making teams, and it's not even big. Taking those couple people off the store team to help with the other teams will *not* affect the speed or quality of content in any measurable way.
---
&gt;However, if you [map break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caSgHNKCABk) into it, you'll notice a lot of the assets were very advanced in production and it just needs some structuring. 
---
There's nothing in there and making it into a playable state would mean a collossal amount of work. Where do you get "advanced in production" from? Because this clearly isn't.
---
If I recall correctly it's an anagram of "fuck arenanet" used as a way to shit on the game without directly saying it. 
---
Don't quote me on this though I don't even have a twitch account lol
---
from what we know elder dragons only have 1 weakness and thats it. doesnt mean we have to kill both at once, we could make a weapon from primordus like we did use dragonsblood spears. braham already has one
---
It adds up if it's an anagram
---
and what has this to do with gw2?
---
&gt; First of all, I wouldnt neccessarily agree that GW2 is combat centric, its as much about appearance as it is about skill and also the game economy is an integral part of the game, at least thats what Anet stated as their intentions for it.
---
Looking at updates, obviously living story has story, but the most common thing to do in the story is fight and kill something.  Even festivals such as the current one (gauntlet arena and blitz), previous (holostampede + wave attack thing), and the next one (labrynth) all heavily feature combat.  
---
 &gt;But if you only spend 1% of your playtime with shitty chores to sort your loot and are able to have fun 99% of the time, why should Anet in your opinion focus on slashing 0,5% off the time you spend on them instead of improving the content you play for fun 99% of your time? 
---
Because games shouldn't go out of there way to have shitty chores in them.
---
There is also an automatic installer on the forums.

Whoo hoo! Gonna go fight Jormag! (Though I’ll admit, I only worry Anet will screw over the norn and everybody who should’ve been part of this story...)
---
We did it boys. Our grand plan has succeeded.
---
Aquatic Ruins      
---
The paths will now rotate on a daily basis instead of being random.     
---
Adjusted the position and number of krait prisoners to reduce backtracking.     
---
Adjusted the skills used in the dolphin path and the deep path.     
---
Added champions to guard the gates leading to the boss room.    
---
Added new boss mechanics to the Jellyfish Beast encounter. 
---
We finally got them to fix this terrible bloody fractal.
---
It was a long shot, but it worked.
---
I still love his snark when you fuck up and die in his trap-maze and he's like "is that really the best you can do?"
---
She's from RWBY.
---
And I do not think there is anything wrong with going for option A. Just as there is nothing wrong with someone going for option B. This is after all a video game played for recreational purposes. This is open world pve we are talking about and maintaining 10k under your own power is better than what most players do for open world stuff.
---
There's only entropy and consensus. If intelligent beings reach no consensus, entropy takes over and does its thing.
---
Tbh it's pretty damn stupid of the Norn, and really highlights my issue with the writing of the Norn in GW2.
---
flipping is when you buy items for low price and then re selling them at higher price. Also, DF is pretty profitable as well, but takes more work with the event tagging VS SW's run in circle and tag
---
I didn't forbid anyone of playing anything, if you keep trying to make it seem like that what's the point of this exchange
---
Gimme like a week and you can have it; I'm using it as a temporary key-farmer name lol
---
arena has like 10k viewer, mythic dungeons 30k, and world first 80k+
---
you are delusional
---
&gt;I didn't forbid anyone of playing anything
---
No one said or implied this at any time.
---
What did you say to that other person? "You have terribly low standards" My point in this conversation is that just because you choose to drive a racecar (option A, the "better" dps builds)on a highway doenst mean that everyone else that drives a 4door sedan(option B, 10k dps open world builds on second rate classes) has low standards and that their cars are shit. We are all driving on the same roads going to the same places, there is no need to shit on others choices just because they are not the best in slot(or your preferred option) for the open world events in a video game. Maybe not the best illustration but its what I got.
---
tbf tho, thief was stupid broken back then
---
id love a warrior that just uses fists,
---
or an engineer with a whip.

but i think i speak for alot of people when i say.

ele+rifle using magic bullets.
---
P2W games?
---
&gt;i till you
---
I didnt think about that, makes sense.
---
She cursed me already cant even say till normally, see there she did it again.
---
Here is the problem with your statement.
---
The Sons of Svanir inside Hoelbrek are breaking no rules. They are following the rules and laws of Hoelbrek as stated by Knut Whitebear, who is the head of that homestead. If you charged in there are started slaughtering the Sons of Svanir, you'd get banished or killed by the guards for the act.
---
Outside of Hoelbrek, all rules are off and in at least two events I can think of, we slaughter Sons of Svanir directly outside of the "city".
---
F ;-;
---
Good to know. I belive you mean [this](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/31192/playing-guild-wars-2-on-linux-performance-optimizations-and-more). That is actually really handy, ty =)
---
Yes I play wvw - almost exclusively. 
---
Yes I play a support role - Tempest auramancer to be precise, again, almost exlusively. 
---
My comment was in relation to the cost of marks, and what your post was entirely about. Nice goal post moving there buddy lol
---
It was an opinion, no matter how you spin it I am perfectly entitled to it and I am not directly or indirectly stopping anyone from playing whatever they want.
---
That is it.
---
I disagree, the signet of inspiration was a great change. Instead of making Chrono the de facto boon sharer where you just gave the chrono your boons ONCE then he would have to just up keep with itself in conjuction with Bountiful Disillusionment,
---
the new SOI is an enabler that enhances the boons of other classes. Chrono was primarily meant to just share Quickness and Alacrity, not all 13 boons. Keep this as it is.
---
Legendary backpacks are glider skins, but that's it afaik.

And yeah, besides maybe the heavy legendary set, the others are absolute trash. Medium armor specially.
