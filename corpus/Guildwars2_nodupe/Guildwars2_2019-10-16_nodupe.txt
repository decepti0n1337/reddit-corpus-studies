Uncomportable Truth gotten downvoted. Take my upvote. This is, the Truth.
---
---
---
&gt; Okay, can someone please tell me how the fuck do people have 20-60 builds / character? I mean thats a very big overkill...
---

---
**Hint:** They _fucking don't._ 
---
This is a lie narrative to bitch about having to pay for what they used to get for free.
---
What video?
---
but i ordered a cheeseburger
---
They are in the Super Rare category, though.
---
That's in the "Last than 1 in 10 000 chances" territory.
---
Well 70 gold is worth like $3.50, so maybe they can afford it?
---
if your guild is overly reliant on an addon to raid and stop raiding due to lack of support of the said addon....you got more problems buddy.
---
Damn cats with their skull cups and they’re cool horns. I want to be a charr...
---
Yes and when Mike Z has sold all of his belongings to keep the servers alive just for *you* and everyone who doesn't care about stangation or passion we'll all be sad knowing what could have been. 😔
---
That's a little melodramatic too, don't you think? If people are looking for reasons to quit, they're going to find them. They just want their quitting/hiatus/break to have meaning or a target to attribute it to. This is just the next thing to tie it to.
---
And, again, I'm really salty that the arc templates are disabled. It's already proving to be a pain in the ass for me to swap between builds and quickly fill roles. At least I have [this for quick searching my builds still](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dghg3z/i_made_a_tool_for_people_with_too_many_arc_builds/)
---
What's WvW?
---
I imagine it's less that, but more so the straw that broke the camels back.
---
Shouldn't this be the least problem in a guild run, especially for the chrono who doesn't have to adjust two multiple off chronos, revs, heal scourges and fb?
---
You mean the weekly vendor? That isnt even enough to eat anything at all from what gets farmed in the time of the event + all the stuff thats in the TP.
---
You can't really effectively complain about it now after it has been made abundantly clear many times previously that they're willing to let go of your community. 
---
Like the WvW/PvP community, once you come to terms with that fact you'll enjoy the game a lot more positively. It's free and casual after all, so there's no bit commitment that needs to be made. Just enjoy it for what it is and not what it isn't.

Hope this helps :)
---
I'm not a part of these players with insane amount of templates but some of my friends are and the best answer I can get is "minmaxing".
---
For example in FotM, you can swap sigil for almost every level.
---
You also benefit from potion for a bonus in boon duration/precision, so these template are also different from raids where you don't have that.
---
Include some very specific build for a certain type of play (tryhard, portal, lowmanning) and you can see how it goes exponentially.
---
All those builds @Lucas, What you gonna do in this 2 weeks without template. grats on the record nonetheless.
---
Ah the Burning Bush(es)
---
Seeing as GW1 is still up, I'd be surprised if it went offline next year.  
---
That said, I can definitely feel it slowing too. If theres not a big drop being worked on in the background, Icebrood will be the last bit of it.
---
If you’re willing, would you share your pick from Costco?   In a similar situation as OP.  Thanks!
---
I had no idea this was a thing. Thank you!
---
No king rules forever!
---
I made 24gp in a few hours because I jumped on right when the event went live and I was able to sell 200 or so trick or treat bags when they were around 8.5sp per. I then kept going and sold them for a while longer. It was fun.
---
Fixed a bug, fixed a bug, fixed a bug, fixed a bug, oh yeah and here's some more Gem Store stuff, and PvM stuff. See y'all again next patch.
---
You have to wait maybe 1-3 months before it comes back, but there may be other nice skin on black lion market soon, it's called shrine guardian (i think), beautiful fox.
---
I just made these and am trying to incorporate them into the decorations we already had out.  It's not going so well... these walls a a little too big and the angled wall is weird (IMO).
---
Nope. You get exactly the same reward for the achievement.
---
They don't have 60, but I had just under 20 that I used regularly, 0 'meme builds' too.
---
Trying to decry it as lying because you didn't isn't just disingenuous, it's actively stupid.
---
Imo, take it away and you get dungeons. I find dungeon speedruns to be infinitely more satisfying when you have to actually take the cooldowns of skills into consideration
---
&gt;just to go straight for end game and play with the spec I actually wanna play.
---
If you actually bought the game you should've realized that GW2 isn't a traditional mmorpg. If you've been trying out fractals at 20, doing some story quests, spvp or wvw, some hearts and achievements, then there's not going to be a magical change at 80. You'll still do the same things. The only difference is raiding, for which you will need a crafting job and/or story completion anyway.
---
Honestly, just use the boost. It'll teach you a lot about the game and you most likely will quit afterwards.
---
I capped out around 900 bags/h in the lab with all boosters and optimal conditions, Halloween is farming time &gt;:D
---
Two of the three new guild hall decorations are also demanding these materials. Sure, it may not be a solution within a week but it is something at least.
---
I'd do a -repair if you haven't already, if not a reinstall of the game before trying d912pxy. There's a lot wrong with that screenshot of yours!
---
this is really interesting because i always thought that i only have 5 builds on my ele, but if you count switching weapons as a different set then yes sure you would need double digits of sets, but in all honesty,    opening inventory and double clicking the weapons you need doesn't take that much time, isnt that even common practice in record runs ? i remember seeing vids of it
---
Confusion is probably becuase characters get personal build templates (three on release, six max), as well as getting account wide build template slots (three on release, three additional free during first month, 27 max).
---
This sub is increasingly melodramatic by the day
---
I feel like the most efficient farm is to buy multiple character slots, parking them near logs/plant(coral, talking about you) that is the most profitable at that moment and harvest them with glyph of bounty. No effort, just pressing F(preferably with quickness), moving as little as possible.
---
This may be in massive hindsight, but if ANET responded like this at around the time ERP was happening, a lot less content creators would've left the game.
---
Yea. Ever seen raid lfgs?
---
Depending on the cost (are these systems preassembled?) The r5 with 1660 is better than the other system.
---
Things you have to look out for:
---
Is it a single ram stick of 8gb? That's bad. The ram should be 2x 4gb stick spaced out.
---
What cooler do they use? The Ryzen 5 with stock cooler is "okay", but even an 20 bucks aftermarket cooler has better performance/noise.
---
The Ryzen 5 will offer you more performance in general, due to 6 cores,12 threads. It's relatively easy to overclock it to 4 or 4.1 ghz on all cores to gain some more performance.
---
In general: If you're tight on money, still check what you're buying.
---
A single stick of ram that's potentially extremely slow, the cheapest 1660gb (or 1060) for that matter, really bad cooler or extremely cheap case with 0 airflow will run slow/bad/overheat and kill the components relatively quickly.
---
If you could send me the 2 systems (screenshots or links) I could help you out some more potentially.
---
Well I main a Charr these days so that's a bit awkward.
---
I asked you if you're sure you played GW1, not if you're sure it has templates in both modes.  It is kind of odd that someone who claims to have played it would keep avoiding talking about the difference between skills and equipment templates.
---
You get an item in your mail that will teleport you to the labyrinth and back if you double click it.
---
Or more likely they are smaller variations on multiple builds very different scenarios. One example would be sigils of slaying, or another would be builds for groups that have spotter vs those that dont. The lists can really go on for some time when you start to look deeper than people QQ'ing.
---
Ah, I did see I had mail but I was distracted and didn't check on it. I assumed it was some level 10 related thing.
---
Looks like some aspects of post proccessing are missing/turned off in #1. post processing in gw2 being tied to bloom=total shit=also can't be compared to the others because of this. Not exactly a negative for those of us who play with post processing off due to the bloom anyway.   
---
\#s' 2-3-4 are comparable   
---
The gains are there for pretty well anyone who can support dx12. I've used it on and off throughout d912pxy' releases in WvW on a server that get regular queued map,  the stability wasn't fabulous sometimes in the earlier days, but I've put in my time and the game and it's matured excellently. 
---
In *every* aspect of the game, without d912pxy *you are at a disadvantage against anyone who does.*
---
Well, they are in the lowest category ... so even if they have within this category the highest drop chance most ppl will get not more than one coffer for playing during the whole event.
---
Atm ppl with alt accs are cashing in big time but I would assume the price for the coffers could go up as well. Depends on the amount of players that are willing to gamble by opening their bags instead of selling them directly and the amount of completionists ingame.
---
The fact that people may/will quit is separate from the claim that the reason they are giving is ridiculous in nature. There are people who have quit because the latest dye pack didn't include a color they wanted. 
---
Yeah, they'll quit. It's still a ridiculous reason for it, though.
---
Boosters for? More drop?
---
Honestly, I haven't looked that far into ashes. Archeage seems to be where I'm leaning towards
---
are you ok
---
I thought MF had diminishing returns? Seriously 1MF = 1 bag per hour? Does it work like this anywhere else in the game?
---
That is *horrendously* inefficient (in terms of gold spent per bag space gained) if you have only one bank tab. You'd be better off maxing out your bag slots, then placing 20 or 32 slot bags in each bag slot first.  
---
According to my calculations, you'd need to have at least 12 bank tabs to make getting the perm bank contract roughly equal in value to getting a 100 inventory slot character (5 20 slot bags) 5 additional bag slots, then making 32 slot bags for all 10 bag slots.
---
(Granted, there is a lot of value in having access to a bank with a bunch of bank tabs, considering those slots would be available to every character on the account...)
---
I have been playing a lot of t3/4 fractals lately and a druid is always a great asset to the party. You get 25 might/fury/vuln./frost spirit/sun spirit. If your group ist not very experienced your ability to overheal can be very important.
---
Druid is by far not the best support atm, but also not really dead.
---
If exotic armor is good enough, do the lunatic wardrobe achievements while the festival is up.
---
Stack up every buff and get your account find as well as your ap as high as you can over the year.
---
One of the reason many peeps are doing weekly keyruns is because you can cash in the statuettes for bl-boosters during halloween. That + accountfind + birthday boosters (or festival boosters) is already 500%. The rest comes from minor sources that will add up.
---
It certainly is, but you never know what exactly will set someone off. The main 2 demographics for templates in the first place are considered to be the 2 most ignored demographics-- raiders and WvW players. A bunch of good reasons to quit and then a dumb reason to quit breaking the camel's back is pretty normal. Sometimes it takes something really stupid to make a change.
---
... i can call a buzfeed blog post on anti depressants a medical journal. It doesn't make it true.
---
What they have shared isn't a roadmap.
---
&gt;People mention chrono, but wtf do you need 20 chrono +1 mirage build for?
---
Important ones I had:
---
1x Mirage
---
1x Focus PChrono
---
1x Greatsword PChrono
---
1x Greatsword PChrono when I don't have Spotter in my sub (I cannot be expected to remember changing what pieces gives me exactly the right amount of precision)
---
1x Power Support Chrono (1000 toughness)
---
1x Power Support Chrono (1251 toughness)
---
1x Power Support Chrono (~1750 toughness)
---
1x Power Support Chrono (~2k toughness)
---
1x Power Support Chrono (duelling/illusions sword + sword/sword + focus)
---
1x Condi Support Chrono (1k toughness (Largos))
---
1x Condi Support Chrono (2k toughness (SH))
---
1x Support Chrono for Qadim 2 (weird traits and build required, e.g. Seize the Moment before recent change, Lost Time after it)
---
^ note that for all of the above, getting the right BD amount is not trivial
---
1x Tower Chrono (W3) - Nomad's gear, Dolyak runes, weird invis traits and skills
---
1x CC Heavy Chrono (Mesmer runes, Paralysation Sigils, Daze mantra)
---
I didn't have a WvW build either, and there are a few I forgot (they're currently disabled in-game). 
---
Sure you can pug every boss with a 2k toughness support chrono but playing with suboptimal gear isn't fun for me.
---
New player here. 
---
* Is it even possible to get all stuffs from the Halloween vendor?
---
For example, there is a minion I like but it costs 120 candy corn cobs... and 1000 corn pieces = only 1 candy corn cob which is... a lot a lot of grind required, I assume.
---
* For the Seven Reapers skins, is it possible to get them as a total newbie?
---
I don't think they are... It's probably some new shiny they want so they can 'complete their character's look' that is a rare drop from a festival bag that hasn't dropped for them *shrug*
---
....I don’t get it
---
Finally all those elitists and tryhards are leaving.
---
I mean, realistically I can probably knock out another set by just not differentiating between, e.g. Illusions and Domination chrono (one takes a focus and the other takes a greatsword, but the gear is otherwise the same).
---
However, when I get to the realm of more than a couple of clicks, I will want a template for it, and for many of the builds I listed earlier, I would need to do a lot more than simply swapping a weapon to not need those templates.
---
It doesn't work like this at all. Not even within the lab. There are more things that factor in the 750 (or more) bags per hour than only mf. 
---
Rotation, you class, your ability to tag, your ability to stay ontop of the zerg and even the equipment of you commerads will heavily influence the amount of bags you will receive. Such high magic find will enable you to receive those amounts, but you still have to make sure that many other things are falling in place (and that will not happen on most pug maps that are out there right now, where ppl oneshotting mobs with staff thieves etc)
---
Get fucked jf you play raids AND WvW
---
Oh I know all that but what I mean is no one is really ever looking for a druid.
---
Again I played a ton of Fractals I own red/blue infusions and the special potion you can only buy with 90 essence. I did main druid so I do know all the perks of it. But again it's hardly ever asked for anymore other then maybe raids which was the only thing I never did in this game. If you make a group or have a guild then yeah you can druid but other then that I doubt it.
---
How fucking tough it must be to press PrintScreen button.
---
Yep, maintenance mode except for the most casual players.
---
Thats fair, and forgot about that. Personally I dont find the amount of effort to swap and have 10diff slayig pots and sigil worth the effort, when I easily do the cm+t4 runs easily but power to people who do.
---
I love how bothered you are by it. What are you 12?
---
[Bladed armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bladed_armor) from the Itzel vendor in Verdant Brink is cheap and fully stat selectable. Dragonfall has a [full Diviner armor set](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Shard_armor) but the recipes require achievements.
---
Trinkets from farming living world maps. LW S3 Bitterfrost, LW S4 Sandswept Isles and Dragonfall.
---
There are several stat selectable weapons but I am too lazy to google. [Dragonsblood weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragonsblood_weapons) have diviner stats and can be upgraded to ascended.
---
Hey the game is great if you haven't played halloween mazes for the past 7 fucking years.
---
Dont worry , anet will repetitively add the same mtx over and over again for easy milking. Just keep being supportive, and spend more money.
---
[removed]
---
Just insert your credit card, you'll have all the templates you need !
---
Oh how I miss Dulfy who helped hold my hand through these holiday events, skins, achievements, etc.
---
We're in a feedback loop now. More cuts will come and then the game will be shut down as players leave.
---
That is - sadly - the biggest problem with the decorations in general. Most of them are cool on there own, but there are simply not enough parts to make a working "set" out of them. That was one of my biggest complaints about the POF decorations. Two from everything and nothing that fits toghether at all.
---
You mean, the people that have exhausted the content, and supported the game since its beginnings ?
---
You can, but there are no curves right now.
---
"In the news, Pennywise seen impersonating Ronald McDonald. When asked to comment said 'Red Balloons just don't lure PvE players anymore, but everyone loves a burger.'  Victims, upon eating said treats, suddenly ported to PvP realm, never to allowed PvE again."
---
actually it's just the camera angle that makes it look that way
---
Make it double!
---
I might try manual swapping but if that turns out to be super trashy. My plan is to play Pokemon for two weeks before returning to fractals.
---
By that logic, the game also didn't release with fractals, living world, elite specializations, copper-fed salvage-o-matic...
---
Wait, what did you have against nautilus reef
---
PSA:  The "Ghostly" effect that you need for the collections only lasts for the ***initial*** 5 minutes; meaning you need that "ghostly" post-processing aura in order to get collection items.  Simply having the food active isn't enough to proc the collections since it effectively "expires" after 5m as far as collection is concerned.
---
&gt; every thief and their grandma has used AC cosplay since 2012
---
The cosplay is not unique, but that's just false, everyone knows true thieves run full shadow abyss
---
RUN.
---
You think what I did is called...  virtue signaling?  Not trolling, or shitposting, but *virtue signaling*?  Time for you to hit up the ol urban dictionary I guess.
---
Ah geeze Anet has blown my budget this month!!   I bought the skeletal mounts thinking that would be it for the season.  THEN the ghostly mounts came out...got those...  NOW these!  Damn... they have me right where they want me!!  Is there a support group for mount skin addicts?
---
I change weapons and skills before every single encounter in fractals.
---
As someone whose favorite mount is the skimmer this is the best part of the patch.
---
I don't think they're saying this from a competitive standpoint, more just from a "remember dungeon prestacking" standpoint where it feels strange and a little meaningless to be able to basically just focus on only dps because all the boons can be prestacked and you can even swap specs and skills after stacking. Could be wrong though.
---
I think all of your ideas are good except they would need open world pvp instead of current wvw mode. I get where you're coming from but anything you make tighter in wvw is something most players will have to wait in down time for instead of just jumping in, if the content or objective is tuned for that group size. 
---
Keep posting and milling over those ideas though, your work flow is good and I might just be missing something that makes the whole picture come together. I'd maybe post your point clearly and in it's own first, than we can unpack it with the rest of your post, which was presented really well, just that it was a little jarring going away and back to a point.
---
Also some Lab runs prefer players who dont use mounts for better farming so look for those in the Lfg! 
---
Y -&gt; Open World -&gt; Central Tyria - Squads
---
Honestly they just get new people in and those people seem to be doing a good job IMO.
---
whoa, shit. Thanks. That's crazy
---
Stat swapping isnt required anymore, since the Loadouts will store the armor, weapons and trinkets for you. While Arc Templates made full usage of Legendary Items, Anet's system will just ignore their existence.
---
Life steal is a small dps increase, if you like the damage reduction I wouldn't worry about it.
---
Druid gives the most offensive boons of literally any class ??
---
And is still the optimal pug strat for most raid bosses
---
Last money I spent on GW2 was $30 on PoF lmao  Gold to gems for everything else. Just like how you can earn everything in game in Destiny! :D
---
...right?
---
I'm familiar with them but if you need a refresher the wiki is your friend
---
I never understood why people get all hot and bothered about some gal with a ton of make-up. They don't even know what she looks like? It's like creeping up on a canvas with a nice picture drawn on it. Strange.
---
It's not *that* bad. It is bad, but it's mostly minor tweaks between bosses, not complete trait changes... usually...
---
Mine broke too
---
Don't do it just learn the game. To be honest Anet need to lock boost for accounts who only have one character so they have to play and learn the game.
---
Not really answering your question, I know, but if filling your inventory with junk isn’t something you like, you’re better off selling the trick or treat bags rather than opening them. You might be surprised at how much gold that’ll give you!
---
&gt; neglection: anet simply doesn't care anymore  
---
  
---
I think this nails it pretty well. If you had like 2 or 3 devs actually invested in wvw, actually constantly thinking about it, listening to the community, talking about it, then at least half of the problems would be immediately solved
---
Spoken like a true creative
---
Regarding the new Mercy of the Mad King achievement, it also woth noting that Personalized ToT bags count. So if you're not in a hurry, you can slowly progress it by doing dailies and activities for now, and finish it with regular sellable ToT bags at the end of the Halloween event.
---
Okay, so I generally don't comment on fashion wars posts, but.. This is some of the best fashion wars I've ever seen. All of these six sets look awesome.
---
power mesmer is definitely not the class i'd pick for 1 spam, but it's by no means weak in open world.
---
one thing i've definitely found is that by itself, mesmer does not do nearly as well with the standard berserker gear setup as most. you don't have big +crit/precision modifiers like many classes do, so by yourself you don't get anywhere near crit cap. and most modifiers like sigil of accuracy don't affect your phantasms. i prefer assassins gear and eagle runes.
---
for the rest, try a chronophantasma build. lots of double phantasms that you can reset multiple times with continuum split and the healing sigil. i prefer greatsword with domination for open world
---
Look at the OP's screenshots again. Those are not the mad realm skins.
---
They're not even available yet. If you look at the wiki page it shows the date of them being available as October 22. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mad_King_Mounts_Pack#Gem_Store_history
---
These Mad King mount skins don't seem to show up in the hero panel mount section to preview, so what the OP is sharing is datamined information.
---
The sub's gone full psychotic.
---
Can we stop suggesting these, it creates bad players, ty
---
Only good charr is my main man Pyre
---
Eventually it will return, sometimes with little discount.
---
Blech. I think I'll pass on these when they get released. I'd buy them if it wasn't for the pumpkin on the face. Besides, from the looks of things they don't have skins for roller beetle, warclaw, or skyscale mounts.
---
I was hoping for Mad Realm skins (and Wintersday skins) for roller beetle warclaw, and skyscale, but it seems pretty clear that Arenanet has no fucking intention of ever making festival mount skins of any kind for them.
---
I know your face from my dream!
---
Enough people will buy them so the message falls on their deaf ears, unfortunately.
---
Thanks, I think it was the skeleton one! Idk why I thought it was new last year lol
---
1 build per boss is extremely convenient.  There are a lot of small changes some people have to remember.  For example, at sloth your chrono (if your running chrono) had better have a focus and possibly the reflect trait.  Conversely, by the time you get to Mathias, you had better ditch that focus, or your gona wipe your group.   Just having one build per boss removes a lot of the memorization.  
---
I personally have a few builds that are specialized for single bosses. In my raid static, I play the secondary healer who swaps to a more dps oriented build on the fights that don't need two healers.  I have a few builds dedicated to single boss.  For example, I tank gorse with minimal toughness just so the chrono (who doesn't run build templates) won't have to swap any gear an extra time.  
---
Your experience will vary greatly based on the roll you play in your group.  There are members of my static who run a condi soul beast at every boss.  But if every member of a raid group does things that way (especially the supports), your raid experience will suffer greatly.  One stupid wipe per boss, for example your golem pushers at qadim forgetting their changes, will make your full clear very frustrating.

Thank you! Now I know where to look if you get sick

[this one if max you want to pay is 500](https://www.costco.com/Dell-Inspiron-Desktop---Intel-Core-i5.product.100405164.html) $50 more but 4gb less ram and you can get an SSD [with this one](https://www.costco.com/Dell-Inspiron-3000-Series-Desktop---Intel-Core-i5.product.100493468.html) SSD is a big improvement over regular hard drives so I'd get that one if I had to pick from the 2.

Wait you think he runs scepter on mirage?  If mesmer is condi dps with scepter shouldn't they be on chrono?  That is what sc's website has.
---
Remember, it's the same rarity as infusions. And infusions' price is... waaaay bigger than 70g. So I presume it will go up like crazy once people blow past 1k bags and get nothing in 2k , 5k, 10k bags :P

Hhhhrg but I want the shimmerwing and the branded skins. (but I'm also broke 😔)
---
According to my messages, the first GW2 thing I actually got involved with was a wiki contest dedicated to the newly revamped personal story
---
Ok
---
&gt; That's just people who were already on the edge of burnout or had a foot out the door looking for the most convenient excuse to try and justify leaving.
---
You're close to the right answer. But you have to ask yourself: why are these people burnt out? Why do they have their foot in the door. Why are they choosing this moment to look for greener pastures?  
---
Because their attitudes don't exist in vacuum. Build templates are not -that- contentious of an issue on their own. But the discontent from the raiding community has been growing slowly over time due to repeated missteps on behalf of anet. This is simply the straw that breaks the camel's back.  
---
There is no new raid content on the horizon. And now Anet has made the process of raiding more of a chore (and real money sink) than it was before, at a time when interest in raiding is probably at its lowest in a long time, if not of all time. This is a symptom of the last two year's treatment, and for many, the final nail in the coffin. As much as one loves the game, there is only so much abuse one is willing to take. It's disingenuous to assume that build templates are the sole reason for this attitude.
---
They listen to players to much instead of objectively balancing the game themselves. 
---
They dont know how. 
---
I have said for years they need to hire an outside team to come in and balance the game.
---
3 templates per account is ridiculous by any standard.
---
Don't let 'em fool you. All those town clothes had skin IDs and could have been converted into armor skins if they wanted to. Not sure why they didn't, TBH. Someone must have bitched about someone else going into battle dressed in casual clothes, like mesmers don't already do.
---
wonder if I'm still jaded or if arenanet is truly, truly null of any compassion towards anyone but themselves and their uninformed, unwary, ignorant customers
---
ALWAYS WATCHING MMMMMMM
---
If you think the art for those are good, you should see the ones for Ascalonian Catacombs (Royal Ascalonian Weapons).
---
Beware, the season just ended, thus sPvP rewards are very low now until the start of next season.
---
I don't think WvW has been neglected. It doesn't need constant updates and players often react in really stupid and dramatic ways when it does get updated which discourages anet from releasing more updates.  Look at how players reacted to the desert borderlands and the warclaw before they were even added to the game. There is an endless number of whiny comments and majority downvotes on the announcement video for the warclaw: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrjjayEhNYw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrjjayEhNYw)
---
Does Lab have dimishing returns for the trick or treat bags? If so, does anyone know the timing/amount on that?
---
Warclaws are great and I don't see anyone who actually plays WvW complaining about them. Nobody actually wants to go back to running across maps on foot again. At the very least it's a nice quality of life improvement. The complaints the preceded the warclaw update were totally asinine and overly dramatic.
---
if you casual, exotic is enough.
---
if you want to be the best, got to grind for it.
---
:/
---
Thank god, less raid shit.  Worst part of the game.   Having to organize a group and socialize is the greatest bar of entry into what is otherwise simple content.  Sounds more like a job instead of gameplay, and its certainly is an activity not based on gaming skill, which should be the most important factor for being rewarded in the game.  Not some social find a group or socialize in a guild with random people all night.
---
Good riddance, raids are the reason all mmos are going down the toilet, nobody has the desire or time to do this shit anymore.
---
good point.  kind of stupid of anet :/
---
this is nice =)
---
A lot of people are looking for reasons to keep playing. The problem is Anet keeps giving less and less reasons.

I guess. I know GW2 is always called Fashion Wars 2, but uh, I didn't expect that even seasonal events goodies in vendor (cosmetics, minions etc) are this expensive in terms of event currencies... I always thought its just the cash shop from my experiences in other games.
---
Are all other seasonal events like this too? :/ Does the developer ever give out cosmetics freebies?
---
f
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
They will not be "balancing" the game any time soon because the WvW gameplay is simplistic and lacking depth, and the maps are tiny. If you want 30 specs to be both diverse and balanced, you gotta have more than 2 or 3 combat roles. Otherwise they are pigeon holed way too tightly into a limited design space and even slightest advantages of one over the others will lead to that spec's dominance.
---
Thanks for showcasing! Helpful :)
---
Lets be honest here. People that leave due to this was already looking for a reason to quit. No one that actually enjoys the game and want to play it would leave over something like this.
---
Thanks for listening!
---
The most important parts are mortar kit for AoE tagging/cleansing/healing, flamethrower kit because yes, rocket boots for mobility. Scrapper is nice for function gyro to pick up people that the bosses smack down. Just pick traits that go with those and whatever your preference is with the others and you'll do fine.
---
Make sure you join an lfg group to best get the bags and then sell them on yhe tp
---
Lmao. Thing is, the devs aren't top of their field, take ages to first *learn* how to do something and then implement it, instead of hiring more skilled people.

Diminishing returns are removed in the Labyrinth.

Do I need to download   d912pxy-1.8.1 too? I don't seem to have noticed much difference in game, I'm still on 40 fps.
---
Just because u were playing your 400 dps longbow core ranger with toughness gear in t4s, doesnt mean its arcdps' fault!
---
Presumably the price of halloween items will go down once more people start farming them so don't count on getting these returns forever.
---
Well anything really. A new guild war, the gods returning and are shown to be evil, the charr and humans go to war again, some other unknown threats return or rise.
---
I'm just saying what I would like. PvE quickly gets boring to me considering the amount of development time it requires. I also don't like the farming mentality that PvE players have where rewards take precedence over fun. Black Desert doesn't have a PvE focused endgame and it seems to be doing fine. Only reason I don't play it is that it's too grindy and the combat isn't as good as GW2.

Try using a VPN. Use a "free" browser one if you don't sub to one.
---
Seconded. I have 3 builds on one of my rangers, and really I'm using only one, rarely second one and never third one. Second ranger have one build.
---
I have a dozen heroes, but with all of them I mostly use: chrono two builds, ranger with one, daredevil with one, necro with two, FB with one, rev with two and this one will one day become three. And guess what, I raid. Somehow I can do all bosses with my poor low build team!
---
Fake scarcity treats the customers like trash. Keep supporting trash mechanics.

Yeh let's talk again in 6 months, will you?
---
Honestly, if all the people like you leave this game it will only make the game a better place. Guild Wars has never been a good fit for elitist pricks. I'd rather see the game due with a handful of nice players than see more hate and vulgarity from people like you.
---
Any flamethrower build will do you just fine. For lab farm the goal is to do low DPS so everyone gets a tag on the mob.
---
Because people don't enjoy WvW.
---
Then the fashion wars begin in earnest
---
Gw1's secret is that it's almost entirely possible to play it as a single player game via henchmen and heroes  
---
There's a few spots that are a pain in the ass but it's possible from what I remember  
---
Gw2 doesn't have that. You can't solo a meta event, dungeons, fractals, or really anything. All you can do is wander the over world and do dynamic events that don't involve any Champions (for the average player)  
---
I suspect Anet also keeps Gw1 running because it still brings in some money in relation to people buying it for the HoM gear or just to try it because Gw2 is a thing  
---
If Gw2 goes full life support mode, I don't really see them keeping the lights on unless they can also keep around a large enough group of people buying gems in a game that isn't getting any more updates  
---
There's people who use this game as nothing more than a social hangout and dress up simulator but I doubt it's nearly enough to keep content playable long after most people have left
---
Sweet and creepy at the same time
---
To explain something which people don't always consider, Skill Cool downs are always in the consideration of these kills, unless your understanding on these kills are simply that we spam all our skills every single phase then I will have no further comment on this. But sadly, the truth is, there are far more minor adjustments we ended up having to deal with because of cool downs of skills, stuff such as headbutting the add early, using frenzy sigil just so on p3 the skills line up and are usable( which sadly also effect rest of the fight as ccing even 0.5s late on p3 will cause mama to cuck the entire group by doing blind aoe spam on p4, we mitigated that by fine tuning over quite a few nights and rethinking skill cd's so things are perfectly and exactly lined, in my eyes these are in line with take the cool downs of skills into consideration.
---
There were actually almost 7 iterations of minor and major changes to the warrior rotation that i wrote through out the weeks before we ended up settling on for this simply because things couldn't line up the way it did. which people may not believe but simply put (headbutt opener resulted in a different rotation, offhand a/m resulted in a different rotation, minor changes in between instability also changed rotation due to vengeance proc weakness which makes u not able to crit resulting in p1 and p2 having a drastically different rotation, so on so forth.)  
---
However I think your point still stands that in a dungeon run you are actually managing cds on the go while for us, at least for me I normally ask for a phase time and essentially write out a few rotations that could be workable and fine tune on multiple grind nights.  
---
Dungeons are still really fun to watch and do I wont lie, probably one of my favorite content in gw2 to this day
---
I love playing with other people, so long as it's **not** *against* other people, and it's **not** in structured groups.
---
the thing with "expensive" things in this game is, that we have an official way to trade real money for ingame gold, and when you realise how many people prefer credit card over farming, these things lose their prestige. same goes for cm stuff. so many people just buy those things with some mystic coins :/. but well yeah. god of pvp could be the only prestigous title in this game, and maybe 2nd and 3rd place title even
---
It's like a time machine, and yet oh so apt
---
I think this would come down to a balancing issue, which very well may be too difficult to bother with. In my ideal setting, raiders would not be disadvantaged by not having their alliance participate in WvW: They could make up for it by being better at raiding. Balance would depend on the fact that alliances would be limited to a fixed number of players. I was trying to give some "creative" interactions, but maybe here's something more in line:
---
Your alliance accruing a total of x magnetite shards in a week gives them a bonus that's scales with x, and your alliance accruing a total of y badges of honour gives a similar buff scaling with y. It would be balanced so that an alliance focusing completely on WvW would get the same buff as an alliance focusing completely on raiding, or alliance members can mix and match. Another way to simplify it is to give alliances a system like the old guild initiative points, and each member can choose what their individual benefits are, and these benefits would scale with your alliance's total "initiative score" for that week.
---
I understand that the knee-jerk reaction gas to assume that people will be screwed over for not diversifying their play styles, but my idea is to just add options and focus on the idea of contributing to a team. Maybe all I really want is a guild-mission system that works a hundred times better than it does now.

Put this here n save"
---
Now they can't. And I find that a little sad.
---
Im so glad that i never play this game with addons. Always switch manually, so i dont have to be overly dramatic. But i always wondering how can people quit just because of things that dont go the way they wanted. And changing build is just less than a minute. But again, i only use 2 to 3 different major builds so i dont know what others with 20+ builds feels.
---
Really? The horned fire themes you can see in any major city, or the last one with all black all white and wings are the best fashion wars you have seen?
---
I guess it would be used if only it would be the first category during a festival without the need to scroll to it.
---
I'd honestly rather ask "did we ever need those specialized enhancements in the first place", tbh. Maybe now that templates are going to be limited, we'll have all the reason to ask for homogenizing those super-specialized utility choices or sigils - for example, could just introduce a "FotM utility" that makes you do +10% damage in Fractals overall. Maybe scales with your AR for extra bonus towards people liking to minmax for absolute perfection. Would save us a lot of inventory space too, because even with equipment template - one of my bags is still going to be half-full of consumable shit.
---
Yeah I like that one too. Good choice of background too

Not all of them sold raid content to others. Alot of them are a good part of the community and would help people through content without any fees.

Gs stamina sigil mirage. Dodge then hit 1 then doge then hit 1.....
---
It's alright, you failed first grade science!! 1!!1111
---
Lets catch you up. 
---
In science, we can't make guesses, we are supposed to look at the problem and infer a possible result, this is called a hypothesis, it's essentially an educated guess, wherein if we look at the data we can apply information to our "special guess". 
---
This is different to a theory, which generally isn't backed up by any solid evidence, or may have flaws that hurt the "special guess". 
---
Already we have in this post a possible cause and effect relationship. 
---
Players wanted build templates. 
---
Arenanet made them, but not with a proper design in place, with many flaws. 
---
Players are leaving. 
---
Arenanet has consistently dropped the ball for content releases related to end game or heavily requested features. 
---
We can use this in our hypothesis. 
---
The hypothesis can be stated as;
---
If the templates or releases are not great, repeatedly, players will not be satisfied, and they will leave. 
---
Already we have evidence to back this up. 
---
See:
---
Icebrood Saga
---
PoF replayability
---
Build Templates
---
WvW Alliances
---
Chairs
---
Mount Skin Lootboxes
---
When we look at our data, it seems that these problems support our hypothesis. 
---
We can come to a conclusion that bad releases hurt the game and cause players to leave, and we can assume future releases will be treated the same way. 
---
Now I know you gave up reading, let alone caring, so I can make a hypothesis that you're just another butthurt toxic redditor who genuinely has no passion for the game.
---
Your response may or may not back up my hypothesis, but hopefully you learned something today.
---

There's also a chance to get Lunatic Armor Boxes from doing Halloween events (I got 4 pieces from labyrinth so far), these are stat selectable exotic pieces, perfect for gearing alts. So save your gold and grind away!
---
I didn't do fractals in months. I think after ice brood saga it's over. They drive away more and more players with every big decision. If the are lucky they can attract casuals who are willing to spent for skins. But the game gets older and the engine is pretty shitty.
---
I like this.
---
Cauliflowers, on the other hand...
---
A big issue, at least for me, is not so much changing traits and skills because that would take me 30 seconds max to do for every change and I already do it very often between bosses or in dungeons and also I know how my builds work so I know what I need and where. The main issue is the gear swap when you have non-trivial stat mix: going from a full zerk to a full viper set is a no-brainer but when you have a bunch of sets that mix zerk+assassin to reach crit cap and that you have to change whether you are in Raid or Fractals or a Viper+Sinister/Grieving mix then it becomes a pain. and if you also do a bit of WvW and have a more Open-World oriented build then you also have some non-obvious stat mix to deal with.
---
Other issue is that what Anet offers is not a build/gear *template* but a build/gear *loadout*: ie. if you change something on their "template" it becomes its new state and you can't just go and say "oh small change that I did is not needed anymore so now I'll be able to revert back to my default state for this setup" because the "default setup" does not exist anymore.
---
For a slightly more detailed version of the "template Vs. loadout" point see [my comment from 2 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dcjado/the_build_template_debate_stems_from_the_massive/f2b5rrj/?context=3) with an example to help understand this point of view.
---
Just let's be honest here. How many builds are you REALLY using on a daily basis? I have 2, that's it, I don't even have to spend my gems what I bought entirely for in-game gold, which all angry players seem to overlook these days and act like they really have to use their credit cards.
---
I mean. Yes they do. I'm not really against QoL options. If you said there were a bunch of useless rune and sigil sets in the game I'd agree with you. I think it's important to take a step back though and ask why people are putting themselves through looking at all that in the first place though. There's an element of discovery. It's a puzzle. There's a thrill in pouring over a huge list of things trying to work out what is optimal. What is best. What is yours.
---
A game, in my opinion, exists to create an experience. Developers facilitate that, but it is not their experience to create. Having all these sigils is a choice. Do you spend more time trying to eek out that unnecessary extra damage? Do you spend more time making dinner? That is your decision to make. Your proposal however removes that. It simplifies that. And sometimes simplification is necessary. But it detracts from the experience. I could just as well ask why do we have all these different styles of armor sets in the game? Because people want to create. Some a costume, some an adventurer, some a battle, and some a build.
---
And now there is a little less of one of those in the game.
---
Players are like liquids, we go wherever we find with less friction. Currently the balance in between each festival event for rewards are in a bad state as you mentioned. Dragon Bash is kind of different though, whatever you do, it sucks (worst total reward per festival so far) Not because map rewards were good, we just couldn't continue farming others.
---
A farmers priorities are: Continuous &gt; Bountiful &gt; No Brain &gt; Fast &gt; Fun in *any* game.
---
**Continuous:** Gold/hour can be bad but we'll do it anyway if there is no other way to reach a certain goal (ie festival time gated rewards or rng bag rewards). 
---
**No Brain:** If a farming player has to focus on game for tens of hours everyday, they'd burn in a very short time. farming method has to be an automatic response of the brain. Eyes will focus on a Netflix show instead in most cases.
---
**Bountiful:** They'll get as much as they can in a certain period of time. This and no brain factor can switch places for some players for different times of their playtime (ie. start as bountiful and end as no brain)
---
**Fast:** Not all farmers are hardcore maniacs, some just want a good sum of reward in a short time each day (dragon bash was better in this part, compared to others so far) Bu as you can imagine, this is the lowest tier of priorty when we look at possible gold farms.
---
**Fun:** And as last, it's fun factor, which rarely shows itself and makes me wonder everytime, why do we even farm.
---
Winter puzzle is fun for some, not so fun for others, which is ok. Bu as you mentioned, not everyone can enjoy same festival activity for a long periods of time, even if they liked it in the first place. In wild case Anet even balanced these activities somehow, one would still pull a bit longer straw than others in the end of the day, which brings us to "bountiful" part again. Imagine bell choir giving one extra bag compared to winter puzzle for hourly rate.
---
I still remember the gambit-deadeye farm on first queens pavilion, it was glorious; only downside was we had to focus but it was fast so we could give breaks, it was relatively fun and the most importantly, it was a good gold/hour farm. You didn't like it? You could just rotate around the pavilion and kill everything non stop. In my honest opinion, first pavilion was amazing compared to current iteration.
---
Even first halloween was great in this regard. We could enjoy world door events by stacking on  doors and spawning lots of high level enemies at once (not like capped head count at lab) There was an amazing chest spawning in the middle tower of lab after we successfully finish a meta event every few hours etc. Farming the dungeon was a good idea too since it could drop a better loot compared to jackshit we get now.
---
TLTR; we will enjoy suffering anyway in any possible scenario for the sake of gaining gold, we could as well choose in which form and I totally agree with you. Anet nerfed other methods for some wild reasons we can't imagine on each event after first iteration in the gw2 history.
---
I wouldn't mind buying them but I don't even know if they are making any raids..... Or how many people are in the raid team.
---
What I said. Just in more words.
---
because I used the term, 'rich'?  If so, yeah that's a fair point.  Certainly people who are not rich can own stock.  I can rephrase if you prefer, 'not wealthy enough to own stock'.  I'm hoping to break through into the positives sometime in the next 3 years.
---
Perma haste is normal for any thief. If you're running daredevil then sigil of stamina is better for constant dashes.
---
They did with a mix of Sinister+Viper instead of full Viper after you reached 100% Confusion duration. I think the stat mix of Mirage Scepter is the same as the current Condi Chrono DPS, only the sigils change.

---
The effect is nice, I just wish they used a different mesh than something that already exists.
---
Yes, Shiny things have more appeal to be bought, however, that wasn't the point I was trying to make. Players buy stuff for different reasons and motivations. Just because you don't buy them because you have your reasons doesn't mean others will follow the same reasons.
---
And there are many who probably buy them just to have them, there are players who have the max amount of characters their account can hold.
---
And there is a way around this in which you can just use the template code and save them in a text file but that is already inconveniencing players because they have to tab out of the game.
---
That is why mean that with all those examples we already have in GW2, in other games, in other genres and platforms people will pay for it as long as they see a reason to do so. That reason most definitely is different to yours and mine but that doesn't mean it isn't there and you have a false impression if you think that players will not buy them or in a lower quantity as it most likely will be.
---
I seriously hope GW2 efficiency will include that in their statistics so that you can see how many of those players who are more engaged in the game already bought it more. Would be very interesting to see what the reality is.
---
I've been saying this since the BGDM drama, and I'm going to start saying it in every thread like these from now on.
---
Anet, hire someone more qualified than amateurs and their love for the game, make your own plugin, and cut 3rd party support altogether.
---
Hell I'm sure Delta would willingly give you the rights to the fucking code for Arc for free if you asked. If you had done that prior, you wouldn't have had to make a TEAM of people make a comparatively SHIT solution to build templates. If you ever intend to make your own official DPS meter, I'm scared shitless of how that'd be implemented after this.
---
Fucking hell.
---
A shame. Maybe one of the earlier tiers: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mad_Mysteries or https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mad_Mementos,  no?
---
I think the whole point is to get the most tags for farming (this being a level 1 bow it seems) for the least amount of gold. Also, it deals less damage so more people can tag and share the XP.
---
He knows.
---
I don't have either of these as well. Maybe it's dependent on whether you've unlocked Lion's Arch on a character, considering that's where the action is?
---
My guild moved on last year and we log in to the game as often as they update raid content. I like to lurk on here in hopes anet does something. Come to ff14. I heard archeage is fun too.

I am so hyped for build templates &lt;3
---
I guess my question and viewpoint is this - 
---
If arc templates **didn't** exist would people have created so many variants of builds and accumulated so many?
---
I'm guessing not to be honest. 
---
So due to how easily arc dps swapped builds it has encouraged the users to collect so many and now it's being taken away its an issue. 
---
So we could argue we have been spoilt?
---
Thank you for the in depth response, I wasn't expecting this.
---
I'll try switching to next target and I'll give calling targets a shot. I only ever thought about using targets in groups but that actually sounds surprisingly useful when you're alone. Also true for Gaze of Darkness, admittedly I use it often for the reveal and then when I'm stunned and my legend switch is on cooldown I'm shit outta luck so I'll incorporate that.

If I'm getting this right, Infused Light should be used more as an invulnerability than a heal? I think I often go too defensive when I'm using it (because I'm usually low on health) but I will try being more aggressive with it now. And I don't know if I'm ready to face real duelists but maybe I will try it and see how it goes .
---
Thanks again for all the tips, I appreciate you taking the time to write it out.
---
All the armor recipes. Best scource of stat selectable exotic armor
---
Couldn't be that, I was in Lions Arch and didn't get that email on that account yet.
---
Yup. Even your guildies are at it. 
---
&gt;shows shocked face at gold com in list&lt;
---
I think so too, but I didn't get the mail on a different account, and not a new one either.
---
Oh dont u worry. That will be fix with top top priority
---
This guy randomly sent me a burger and fries like 3 years ago. I never took them out and i religiously clear my mail because i need to keep it for the rest of time.
---
I think superior version requires higher level weapon
---
he even included a toy
---
I agree, simply realising anet wont manage to build on any gamemode other than open world makes not playing the game so much easier.
---
You think damn wvw could be really fun right now. But then you remember it likely isnt and itll only continue to get worse.
---
Correct. You need at least a lvl 60 weapon.
---
Honestly all I wanted from it was something small like 3 envelopes for participating and 2 extra for winning or something. Right now it's like 5 for winning and nothing for losing.
---
"Buy this raid so you don't have to play it with other people"
---
It's designed to do as little damage as possible so everyone can tag the enemies as you run around in a zerg. Otherwise Shortbow Thief just constantly clears the enemies before anyone else can tag them.
---
Thank you! A commission like this would be around 200 - 400 Euro, depending on the complexity :D
---
:))))))
---
Thank you very much! :3
---
I'm using Bound as my dodge, it's just a normal staff Daredevil dps build, but with this level 0 shortbow with minor runes as a swap weapon. I also have an ascended staff with Force and Impact sigils, for the named bosses.
---
This shortbow's only purpose is to deal as low of damage as possible so that while zerging around the lab with the low-health trash enemies, you don't accidentally hog all the kills. Otherwise on shortbow thief it's very easy to accidentally kill everything before anyone else can tag it.
---
That's what the "remove your trinkets" request in lab farming is: a request to lower your damage so that everyone can tag the trash enemies. Running a really low level shortbow lets you not worrying about removing your trinkets or crippling your build, you can merely swap to a level 0 weapon and deal 200 damage a hit instead of 5000.

Overlord of all Sylvari
---
&gt; with no promise of what that money is going towards
---
This is the part that is the biggest deal in my eyes. If the people who would be paying extra for build templates (raiders and hardcore players) thought even for a second that Anet would be putting that money into developing more raids and content geared towards them, there wouldn't be as much of an issue I'm sure. But we all know it would be going towards move living story and more gemstore outfits, because that's what gw2 is all about now. No thanks.
---
Jeez, what a long post. I'm afraid you will find lack of readers here.
---
My few thoughts:
---
- one cannot balance WvW together with PvE and PvP, it's impossible; WvW is too different and has too different balance needs to work together with the rest; best solution would be a separate game that focuses purely on WvW
---
- small things, especially cosmetics, matter; If you let guilds pick what decorations are on their claimed objectives, what weapon/armor skins guards of their objectives wear or even race of said guards it would boost popularity of WvW considerably
---
- WvW could have really brought the meaning of the "Guild Wars" name back. They could have created WvW guilds from the start as separate from normal guilds or even servers; now I guess project of "alliances" is not gonna happen because old code is probably a mess and no one can break through it
---
- game is getting old, and as all old games it's getting harder to change or expand it; I think players should stop expecting, demanding, waiting for new things and accept that sooner or later they will have to move to another game
---
I dont think grinding gold in gw2 was ever fun or worthwhile personally. And I doubt ANYONE plays the maze for its great gameplay... 
---
Gw2 has lots of amazing gameplay but the maze was always garbage. The fun part was only its limited availability and good rewards.
---
What they absolutely don't care about is bringing in new players or bringing back players who quit. If they did, then build templates would've been something they introduced to try and bring people back. Instead it's another giant fuck you to everyone who quit. They don't care, because people will still shovel money in their direction anyways.
---
Its a plant/fire type
---
Could we get the dyes too I really like thetones and would like to experiment with them
---
only that was also not my point again. it was an example that the reasons why people buy things is different and can be different to what you accept as "worth spending money on".
---
Yesterday I met duelist mirage in WvW, while I was playing my zerg engineer. I had no chance of survival against his mobility, but... I managed to hide myself in small pig-pen in one of the camp buildings. Fence protected me from his attacks, while my presence blocked him from taking the camp. Once he jumped into small pig-pen all his mobility and illusions were worthless because my AoE attacks filled whole pig-pen and fences stopped all his teleports. In the end he decided to retreat.
---
So - my advice is to use terrain creatively. Open field favors mobile classes, allowing them to jump around you.
---
&gt; Honestly, if all the people like you leave this game it will only make the game a better place.
---
True, that way Anet can focus 100% of their resources on garbage gemstore options that you can all sink your money into
---
So because you personally only use 2 builds, everyone else is being overly dramatic? How do you even rationalize that thought in your head?
---
bosses can be busted in like a minutes and grant 10 bags+ so ez to kill them.
---
Duelling, yeah the first is know ur build, all of it. Every Little Heal, what is ur Burst Dmg, what are ur weaks and where are ur doges, blocks and Distorens. Then know ur enemy pertty much the same to learn, beside that u should know the animation too and optional his important cooldowns. That knowleged is to achive by simply playing the class. Beside that hold ur button spaming down, dont hit with a burst when u are blind or ur enemy has a block or distort. 
---
Against Mirage yeah tabbing threw and look on boons is a good thing, beside that u can look on his movment and on his skill that he use. Illus go only forward when they go, and dont use some other skills.
---
Against Thief Steahlt that is a reaction game, when he go invisble move a little and make u ready to doge when u see him.
---
Around release, one of the rewards for completing the last story step were WvW blueprints. The game invited you to try it out and suggested WvW is the endgame after 'completing' PvE (or what there was available in PvE).
---
The thing is that player retention requires posing the playerbase with challenges. PvE content becomes trivialised after a month or two of its release - it's scripted, and people will find out gimmicks to make boss fights easier, and the information will spread. People will get better and start farming PvE content without any more challenges.
---
In order to stay active and engaged, we need to be challenged. Some people impose their own challenges, like solo fractals or low-man raids. These are a good sign - it's possible to go out and beyond the basic design scope and aim for the impossible; the system doesn't cut you off from potential challenges.
---
Thing is, only a small portion of the playerbase will be interested in self-imposed challenges in a game where everything else is tied to instant feedback and instant reward. If the game was just a sandbox with a set of tools you need to create your own story and goals with (think Stellaris or other 4X from Paradox), it would be a different thing altogether.
---
The challenges that are implemented in PvE are meh at best - timed races and mount adventures, or the HoT adventures and mini-games that quickly become frustrating for most players.
---
This leaves PvP and WvW as the natural places for challenge. We get a system sandbox and then we compete against other players. Whilw strategies and meta game may become stale, you won't have two same days in a challenging environment where you compete with other living people. PvP and WvW is the natural long-term endgame, and should be incentivised both with rewards and by better new player experience.
---
I miss Ricochet on the pistols :(
---
Oh yes. It was amazing /sob
---
I like this too, too.
---
They do, but there probably just isn't enough raiders who make investments worthwhile.
---
F, your stuff really helped.
---
What annoys me to no end are people not understanding the problems raiders have at all *and in addition to that* telling them what they do or do not need or want.
---
GW1 is still running just because it uses the same servers as GW2. It will be shut down with GW2, there is literally no reason to do so before that.
---
The latest patch wasn't that bad lore wise though?
---
Oh its the story
---
and there's the fact people don't usually loudly announce that they are joining again after they've loudly announced that they had left because that would just be awkward
---
They have won the fashion battle but will never win the fashion war
---
You should to play other class to understand how they work. After you get understanding it will be easier to fight them. 
---
Also there are many players that use broken build and just try to assert themself in this way, keep it in a mind.
---
You can. It just get you out of the instance. And afterward you can go back in and get to the exact point you were with the chexkpoint
---
Game does have roadmap. Trust me, it does. It's just that they can't show it, they have no evidence of it existing, they will lock and remove threads on official forums asking for it, and ban people who persistently ask for a roadmap.
---
But it's totally there.
---
Quickly tested yesterday for 30 mins my full nomad engineer and it got... uh... 14 bags.
---
I will buy! Because I love GW2 and find official build templates an upgrade! And I don't want to use unofficial 3rd party hacks.
---
I always used to purchase on TP every new released dye (i'm a completionist for these things). But since i have a lot of alts (more than 40) and after seeing how with every new birthday i'm forced to get a dye that i already have, account bound and that i can't even recicle i decided over a year ago not to purchase anymore dyes. For the 7th birthday i had enough characters to get the ones i was missing from the pool of available ones.
---
Not certain but think all new accounts have limited trading for 7 days ftp accounts  can only trade very limited supplies so doubt holiday stuff is included
---
is this a new achievement?
---
Real talk, do you miss the functionality of it or just the idea of it? It was always a completely shit trait. Even traited, pistol auto was worse for tagging than shortbow auto since it only had a 50% bounce chance, and the extra 150 range from the trait didn't even give it a range advantage over shortbow because shortbow has arcing projectiles
---
The mail said something about being lvl 35 OR owning PoF.
---
So if your alt account doesn't have PoF that might explain it.
---
Patchnotes say that you can buy one from a skritt though.
---
I wont recommend it for same reason  evryone else told you 
---
But. If you still want one just buy an 80 boost in gem store
---
-repair
---
Well, I'll have two number 9s, a number 9 **large**, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a **large** soda.
---
Well 4, one in the labyrinth, beetle one, and they added a jackal / raptor one, and a springer / Skyscale one this yesr
---
Ronald McDonald, IT, what's the difference?
---
Ow, Gotta check those out, thanks
---
There was one I'd see often in the olds pvp lobby in EU
---
Thx 4 info!
---
Ah wow. Who cares?
---
Desperately trying to be positive no matter how delusional is what makes gw2s sub so much fun.
---
Imagine being excited over alliances coming soon right now... yikes
---
I mean, it's not that difficult for Anet to announce "we have plans and / or are currently working towards wing 8"  
---
and yet
---
I left my last company for this exact reason. I had an awesome team that was replaced almost completely by some new guys who are friends with management. It becomes really stressful to explain the same thing 10 times. And it's even worse when some of the new hires are not even from the same industry and don't know any basics.
---
I have simple not time to explain everything from the beginning of time. I need experts in my team that I can leave alone and be sure, that they come back with awesome things. And not a bunch of guys who know nothing about the industry and need heavy micro management to get anything done.
---
When I stated my concerns at management level, I was more or less told to deal with it. I did not deal with it and got a new Job. Now they are struggling to get anything done and chaos broke loose.
---
You mean how they have told us to expect a WvW alliance update for 2 years?
---
im honestly all up for the shit on anet train but festivals have been always the same since gw1 and also in other games..
---
No number would be successful. Quaggans are the living embodiment of incompetence. They can't even defend themselves and become dangerous only when an elder dragon corrupts them. (source: vanilla story and maps)
---
Mechanics log: provides a log for mechanics 
---
Boon table: provides a more readable table for boons 
---
Now what I don't understand is why you couldn't have googled this instead of asking on Reddit. Heck the site itself linked by OP has the explanation in there. You could have very easily found the solution yourself and wouldnt have had to write a non contributing question to waste other people's time. 
---
Of course, that is assuming your intention wasn't like the people who writes "who?" In posts about any content creators.
---
No you can as the instance is in the map you see everything on that map including waypoints
---
I'm not a raider, but all this talk about build templates has me very confused.
---
Build templates haven't even been released yet, so why are people complaining about how they're running the game?
---
I love playing with or against other people, as long as it's not everyone doing their own thing "in a group" with essentially zero meaningful interaction, communication or teamwork.
---
Man, did you pick the wrong game for that.
---
People do accept. But the most logical result is to quit. Wvw isnt only not going to improve, it gets more stale and worse over time. Sometimes accelerated by anets great decisionmaking.
---
I actually lucked out today, getting two infusion from opening 500 bags. Never got anything close to that before
---
In fact, Quaggan have an enraged mode innate to their species, although corrupted Quaggan were pretty mean, regular Quaggan can also be badass if they chose to, example: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Baroosh
---
So you get gold by selling the ToT-bags and Wintersday gifts, if you choose the extra 100 Wintersday gift as the last reward you get with today's sell prices:
---
Halloween: 311 ToT bags = ~20 gold  
---
Wintersday: ~22.4 gold
---
Prices varies through out the year though, so is about the same.
---
What about minstreal gear with superior sigil of luck? 75% chance for random boon on kill with no internal cd.
---
Not in 2015, and at this stage I dont play anymore. Neither do the majority of those people I interacted with and against. 
---
Lets see what the future brings. Doubt itll be growth and huge content drops after anet alienated a huge part of its playerbase.
---
If you pay attention and look at the picture, those Crystal wings are from Leap of Faith, the mount skill. The chat even records "airborne" text, hence /stuck doesn't work because the game thinks I'm perpetually falling.
---
what raid team? the last succesfull raidteam was disbanded to support the struggling LS teams
---
Genuinely true. This sub was very different even when I joined it during S3.
---
Normal Quaggan or enraged Quaggan?
---
/stuck doesn't work because airborne, and no checkpoints in Night of Fires, have to restart from the beginning when you leave instance. Please don't offer advice if you're not sure what you're talking about, and didn't look at game chat text.
---
I agree wvw should be a standalone game, but not necessarily for the reasons you cited.
---
Mostly so it would get rid of the openworld playerbase which is toxic and mostly harmful towards wvw for various reasons.
---
Night of Fires has no checkpoints, you redo everything.
---
What are you talking about, lol? This is story instance. See minimap red'd out area
---
you get: 3 build templates (traits/skills) per char, 2 gear templates per char and 3 accountwide build slots + 3 free accountwide build slots shortly after release in the gemstore.
---
characterwide templates can be expandes up to 6 build and i think 6 gear
---
Doesn't work airborne. Read chat.
---
Yes? 
---
A lot of people blindly purchase whatever is shit out on the plate in front of them. They don't care that an essentially free, superior feature was just taken down by Arenanet to wobble in with their inferior version being sold at a premium.
---
Kind of amazing how people who don't ever need more than a Template not only express that but also are happy about the misery that people walk through right now.
---
Pretty disgusting.
---
Sometimes ingame mail requires you to visit a city. Have you visited a city with the lvl 8 account?
---
Oh I'm absolutely not criticizing you guys for prestacking boons or running offensive supports, it's just a call back to dungeon days on ele having to blast fields and use all the right skills and then swap weapons while running while your warriors spam might and having boon uptime be a lot more touch and go. Nostalgia trip.
---
ahh toxic casuals. the worst part of any game. i will be happy if the game finally dies because of people like you &lt;3
---
BuT i HaVe 245 BuILDs... /s
---
Reminder that desert BL on release lagged every 2 hours and this wasnt addressed, admitted or fixed for months. Yet pve trash was still bashing on wvw players during this time for not liking their new content.
---
It's also built with a lot of vertical features, yet the new OP class (rev) they introduced had its skills break as soon as there was a tiny amount of elevation. And fyi it still does that.
---
Imagine hundreds of players hyped for a new spec, only to realise their skills wouldn't work on most of the new map. And then being told by pve players to stop whining about the new stuff they got.
---
:)))) loud casuals having opinions about things they barely play and dont understand is the reason gw2 is fucked.
---
XD
---
What are you talking about? The game's been in pretty great shape lately. Growthmar Valley is a fun map, and always seems to have a lot going on. Who did they "alienate?" Are you talking the "Charr are not mean enough" people?
---
More visual vomit.
---
Quaggans on their own expand when they get angry.
---
I could see an army of enraged quaggans give him a good fight.
---
If Firebrand/Renegade was more efficient on a boss than Druid, it would be on Snowcrows by now. As is, Druid is meta on 15/19 boss encounters, according to SC. The mix of alacrity ren, quickness with chronos, and spirits + fury + spotter + etc. from druid is apparently the best comp for most bosses. I agree that in fractals Druid is dead because you can prestack boons and Soulbeast is meta, so spirits are a non-factor and all the boons Druid can give don't matter. I still see at least 1 Druid in every single pug raid though.
---
Any best class for Labyrinth farming ?
---
also, any specific place i could just put some turrets and "auto farm" some bags here and there ?
---
You can have week long matches and competition that is optional, if it gives reasons and ability for entire groups (being servers) to compete together.
---
Gw2 has never allowed that. Rewards cant work if anyone can swap to the winning team at will. Groups dont have self determination because anyone can swap to them at will. 
---
If wvw was essentially between 3 alliances of guilds without randoms added, you can have healthy rewards and competition for winning. Bonus points if anet weight scoring based on overall population to account for prime / off prime.
---
See it from this perspective. Doing numerous of guides and taco markers everyday may seem excessive to some people but yet you still do you. That’s how you keep enjoying the game. Others simply fine tune their characters to push themselves further in different encounters. That’s how they enjoy the game. 
---
Wouldn’t it suck if you’d be hindered in your fun by asinine reasons?
---
You should start looking at shortbow as a utility weapon, not a dps one. 
---
It has blast/projectile finishers, evades, teleports, some light cc, and aoe poison + weakness application, all spammable, all ranged. No other thief set comes close to that, and it took years for other classes to get similar levels of bloat in one weapon set.
---
Oh, and I guess that tagging potential is a form of utility as well!
---
well, probably thats the reason why you dont understand it.. you never used the other buildtemplates. 
---
also to considet: people already payed quite a good amount of money for bags to store more gear because usually you dont want to characterswap if you want a simple build/gearswap (and sometimes, like in the middle of a story instance you cant charswap anyway). now you have to pay again for more gear templates or you have to swap manually again. and with a legy armor swappinh manually is a shitton of work. without arc templates i had never made my legy because its basicly a overpriced useless piece if gear that creates more work then it helps
---
I expect some iteration of "I hate pvp, wvw, raids, veterans and anyone that presses buttons with a passion. This game is for casual one-spamming safespace ONLY. Clearly the BEST GAME 4EVRRR".
---
We need the old Traveler stats back for this!
---
Magic Find! Vitality! Just a wee bit of power!!
---
I don't know if f2p accounts can do it (and if they can, it's only for their own profit as f2p have no way to transfer any kind of wealth to someone else, so you can't create 16 f2p and farm the full collection for main acc - you'd have to buy 16 PoF or core keys).
---
However, opening 1000 bags to get the coffer is definitely something you'd want to do on any non-f2p alt account(s) you may have. Just like the PoF rare collection that let you choose a (then expensive) spec weapon 2 years ago.
---
Yeah I was totally talking about the amazing story and the charr drama...
---
Yikes
---
&gt; openworld playerbase which is toxic and mostly harmful towards wvw
---
Strange, I found WvW playerbase to be way more toxic when I first joined that mode. I genuinely felt like WvW players don't want anyone new to start playing WvW
---
Good point. I never had one cause the repos were just for local use originally. 
---
https://github.com/MarsEdge/GW2-ArcDPS-Mechanics-Log/commit/2cfe9813dbee5b01936d50ee95801b270fffcba3
---
There's a disconnect because "veterans" don't want anything, but to complain. The rest of your rambling comment you just pulled from your ass.
---
Which achievement ?
---
lets be honest tekkit.. you do great woek for the community, but in the end you are more like the king of casuals
---
There's a middle ground between 60 and 2.
---
Claiming that everyone that wants more templates than the amount that are available is some kind of freak with 60+ builds is just as overly dramatic.
---
You got stuck this  time in a story instance and that's about it right? Like yes it's annoying but it's not like you have lost 2 hours of progress: report the bug, re-do the instance, make sure you are a bit more careful with what you do when the portals spawn to avoid this issue from occurring again and you will have lost 15-20 minutes at most.
---
I'm not really sure what is the point of making this point? Yes bugs happen in most softwares, some are minor, some are annoying, some you can implement small workarounds to try and avoid them and I'm pretty sure Anet did not leave/put some in just to make people lose time when they need to re-do an story step.
---
Seconding this. Kalla/Shiro. Pop superspeed to keep up, shortbow pierces and basically has a ton of AoE. And citadel bombardment the door events.
---
id rather have interesting weapons with utility on them than a single boring/unusable weapon purely with utility
---
Anet hasn't even considered balancing rewards since HOT. At the start of HOT they rebalanced the rewards that were well out of line and worked towards an update to enable cyclic reward structures.
---
Clueless monkeys cried for weeks that certain pve content was now rewarding. The changed were ultimately reverted and rewards were boosted across the board. We got ML farm as a result. During PoF they +1d that with the abomination that is istan.
---
The logical result was that farming ingame gold was faster and that prices would readjust. It also decreases longevity of all content that isnt as rewarding.
---
Anet provided a new carrot to grind these maps for by providing frequent gemstore updates, which is the new model. Farm gold in a few select ways, convert to gems, feel rewarded.
---
Balancing rewards hasn't been a priority or attempted since hot. Now they might, maybe, rebalance a map like istan almost a year after it's been non stop farmed and created a surplus of a million ectos.
---
lucky.. xD
---
They wouldn't put 2 people on alliances if they did.
---
I'd love that care to PM me in the game? Lost Dawn
---
I saw some chap post the other week he like 50 builds for chrono.
---
*rolls eyes*
---
It's not impossible, it's irrelevant. If the "veterans" could explain in plain English what they want and refrain from sperging out over every proposed change then I would take you more seriously. Anyone who quit playing because of the warclaw needs to go outside more.
---
While they are cheaper than say *crafting* viper exotics, there are better options than crafting lunatic since they aren't that much cheaper. The collection free parts are great though.
---
As much as I would like to F for another fan project, I can't - never used this one, or even heard about it from anyone in 2 raiding communities I'm part of...
---
I can tell you didn’t play GW...
---
&gt; openworld interactions
---
Can you elaborate a bit more? What interactions exactly?
---
&gt; Unlike openworld which is designed as coop[...]
---
so in WvW people in the same team should not cooperate? 
---
&gt; [...]coop where the actions of other players have very limited impact on your gameplay,
---
yes, that sums up open world nicely, but does not sum-up PvE because it's false for raids and fractals. 
---
My first impression with WvW community was - you are not supposed to talk here, you will get flamed and cursed etc. for writing anything on the chat that is not a mixture of short objective names and numbers indicating where is enemy. You are expected to listen to ever-cursing shrieking screams of whoever is currently commander on your server in one-way TS or discord.
---
Heres what they have caused in my opinion. When you have only one aspect of a festival worth doing and that is all that gets done. It gets milked for every drop. But the downside for me personally and im pretty sure theres a lot of you like me. This is the 4th labyrinth. Im tired. Im bored. I seriously can not do more then 2 rotations before quitting out. The least they could have done is shortened the door spawns or added more. 
---
But, basic point. Give us something else please for all that its worth i beg of you anet. For my sanity and the sanity of thousands of others. Give bonus rewards for open world doors would be a great idea. I mean, seriously, who does open world doors? Anet. Show me stats that people even do those. You could rework them entirely. Make them like rift portals with a champ to kill at the end. Maybe add a couple small chests to the JP.
---
Make sure to equip higher levels of armor. If you are dying a lot look for drops that have toughness or vitality as a stat and make sure you are attacking mobs at your level and they are not champions (gold around icon). Learn to kite and dodge as well.
---
The lab is supposed to be a farm zone and it's not really fun to run in so yeah expect to see toxicity to try to be efficient in.
---
Complete Events and do hearts. Also look at the gear you get from enemies and compare it to what i have on you. You should focus on gear that gives you power. And not only the weapons matter, your armor matters too.
---
Holy moly, you have different build for every boss? Are they really needed?
---
I personally have used only two builds at raids: Axe condi mirage and power &lt;what I feel like playing today&gt; (holo/dd/weaver/dh). That's it. Create character -&gt; gear it -&gt; forget it.
---
I never change skills, traits or gear, unless meta goes upside down. Not even when squad composition is weird (not trying to compensate with extra crit change or something).
---
Though I don't follow meta exactly... one or two skills/traits probably are in different spots, or weapon/armor has different sigils/runes, or even a non-meta weapon, or no assassin armor pieces for 100% crit change... but still managed to kill all bosses without problems.
---
Its a farm so you have to take it as serious as possible. But if you don't like the comm then move to the next map or open a squad yourself.
---
Sorry, can't hear you over the sounds of the thriving city of Rin.
---
^(Oh, wait.)
---
They did explain these issues for both desert bl and warclaw. They were berated by people like you for voicing concerns or criticism and the changes went live with all these obvious issues.
---
Then the population of the gamemode declined less than a month after the update, both times. Luckily they went outside more :))
---
The videos where people in desert bl beta are walking into every objective on the map are still online. Pretty clear.  Took them more than 6 months after the map went live to fix this.
---
Aye it's sort of a catch 22, the most hardcore players that raid etc are probably the only ones that use these third party build add-ons, and they are also likely spending less money on gems than casuals.
---
 It doesn't make financial sense to cater to the 10%
---
Here comes the down vote train

Can't log in right now but [something like this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PeQAIlRw6YhMIWJW+OutfA-zRIYRUwXC2uEmA-e) is what I run on engie. Lots of options in gear, weapons, and traits. For the lab farm you don't actually need to do damage so most people take off their trinkets to not burst things down (lets more people hit stuff). If you take rifle, the 5 skill is more mobility. The 3rd utility skill can easily be swapped out it's just there for more cleave really (and cc). Elite can also be swapped as you like and the traits right now are set up for decent personal damage and boons but I could swap things around to be way more tanky (it's not really needed). Gear is just default meta PvE stuff but again feel free to run no trinkets, the runes are way overkill for a farm like this and just exotics works fine.
---
well shitposted.
---
Tyvm i usually run holo but might try scrapper for this one. also is there a good spot just to sit around watch a show and take down foes while standing?
---
You probably just have to get used to the game mechanics. I remember dieing a lot when i started playing and I had mmo experience before.
---
Make sure you use your healskill (if you're not using the signet) and dodge everything that looks like it hurts. Get used to dodgeing in general, GW2 is all about active defences. 
---
Greatsword 3 is also an evade.
---
In GW2 going to higher mobs well over your level is gonna get your ass kicked and you wont earn as much xp as you do on mobs your level or around. 
---
So if you are level 9 now try and stick within 3 levels above you after that you will struggle at least until your learned your class.
---
Also just random adivce about your weapon skills read what every one of them do. It might sound like alien language to you if this is your very first mmo but keep on reading anyway and figure out what it means. Like for example, as a warrior you will have access to a lot of stuns and other skills the like. 
---
So think of a chain to use. Your second skill on the great sword is the big aoe but you can not move when you cast that so at that point you would want them to be stuck were you are. Stunning or cripple them or using any other crowd control that stop them from hitting you first is a good thing to start with, then you run the hundred blades on them. 
---
At level 10 you will get weapon swap this means that you can now use two sets of weapons in combat. Whilst leveling using axe/axe and Greatsword usually will make it very easy for you to dish out damage. 
---
Further on at lvl 11 i think and ahead you earn skills on your right bar. Put some points in to skills. Shake it off is probably a good thing to get first so that you can cleanse and have a stun breaker. Banners are good too not only for getting more buffs but if you pick it up then you have a speed buff on it. This goes for any banner.
---
Same thing as before though read on every skill and learn how to use them in to your chain of combat.
---
At level 21 you will get your first trait line. It is what will also make your stronger. Go with one traitline at the time whilst you unlocking them all.
---
Remember that when you hit level 80 you have unlocked all core traits and all skills so there is no way that you can pick wrong. You can always swap when out of combat so you are never stuck with something. And ask questions. People in mapchat are generally very nice to new players do don't be afraid to do this. If you are in a f2p account you cant use the map chat but you can use say chat if you are close to people. You can also whisper someone but ask them to add you as friend because after a few whispers you wont be able to reply back if they dont. 
---
Anyway welcome to the game and hang in there it is a matter of learning and when you have it will be amazing combat :)
---
People who believe they can control open world zerg environment need to rethink their life choices.
---
Farmed thousands of bags last year, rarest drops were 2 necklaces. Opened my first stack this year and got the purple infusion. Hoping this year keeps getting better!
---
Spellbreaker but it's offseason so play whatever you enjoy. I certainly prefer core.
---
OP: I suck at being efficient and I'd rather complain at people actually trying to.
---
&gt;people prefer credit card over farming
---
With that argument even God of PvP isn't a prestigious Thing anymore cause you can buy that as well. Win Trading is a thing sadly enough.
---
Still even with the possibility to buy stuff like this the number of ppl that have those remains rather small. So it remains kinda prestigious imho.
---
Sure, but the point of my comment was that XiahouMao said they can't be used for vendors without first having a sink... I was saying the vendor itself could be the sink and thus a sink isn't needed before a vendor. All depends on what the vendor sells for them and for how much.
---
Holy shit your label is gold
---
Full ascended on all characters and several legendaries.

There is nothing to grind but loot boxes anymore.
---
Quaggan Society adapted to their formerly peaceful and energy-low deep sea environment. 
---
If necessary, Quaggan can train off this "sloth" in acting and language and become just as efficient as the other races.
---
&gt;  with no promise of what that money is going towards."
---
Erm...upkeep of the game? Dev Wages? New content? Do you think the money is going to sit there or something?
---
Again, I think the best spot would be in the central area since [steve](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Labyrinthine_Horror) likes to run laps around the outside.
---
It is not like i don't understand that this is frustrating we have all been in this situation at some point, but shit happens and there is nothing else to do but to restart the instance.
---
Fun fact: you actually can. But it takes effort.
---
As you leveling, wath for enemy level. As for starting, i found great to just pick a map, then 100%,and only after move to the next. Beware that as you leveling, higher level items usually a lot better but they lose effectiveness as you overleveling them. If you are struggling, try picking some defensive options on armor (like toughness or vitality stats), aggro less monsters and do not forget that you can heal using #6 skill, also you can dodge using V button.
---
You're complaining about issues that were resolved years ago because complaining is all you want to do. The warclaw got patched in days. It's clear that a lot of players can't help getting overly emotional about these things. It's the reason "balance" is such a problem. Every single week servers lose on purpose because the players are too emotionally fragile to go up against a stronger opponent that will probably win which only leads to more unbalanced matchups because the stronger server will drop a tier while weaker server moves up.
---
"Game is in content draught".....new content is released "you call this content?"
---
New raid wing is released "Anet doesn't care about raids"....seriously wtf is with this community, what is content to you lot?? Continuing story, new armour, build templates, new food recipes, new legendary sigals, new weapons....all new content but yet somehow because nothing came out for PvP, Fractals and Raids there is absolutely nothing for people to play? 
---
This is why people look down on these modes, the players cannot be satisfied and demand the game is catered to them, fuck the casual players that actually keep the game populated.
---
We all have Happy Meals down here

---
The fire really does look amazing. 
---
Lowkey hoping they go back and edit other flame effects
---
I just think is mad that he didn't get the Iron Beast Greatsword upgrade that we get....
---
Eh. If you want optimal on thief you run Sigil of Stamina and Sigil of Frenzy. 
---
Flame doesn't do anything cause all your shots are aoe anyway and you barely crit with less gear on. 
---
Stamina because it refreshes all 3 dodges per kill, and dodging on daredevil = swiftness + extra fast movement.
---
Frenzy isn't as important but extra traps for doors is nice (: Also run the signet trait with signet of infiltration to get initiative everytime an enemy dies, you can spam SB 4 very easily.
---
The problem is that so many people do not read the text in the lab lfg tool. The commander create the squad adds it to the lfg-tool and a message saying exactly what he/she want her lab to be. 
---
You always see people who join a group that clearly say something and then they get shitty about why it is like that. if you want a lab to be in a certain way then you join the lab that have what you need. But people seem not able to read. Consider there are like 50 groups at any given point (either in the festival tab or in the Tyria squad tab) there has to be the group you want so no reason to join a group who don't do what you want.
---
Get used to moving around with your character, if you see monster attacking you, try to step aside, the attack can miss that way. If you can't move at time, use the dodge button (usually V). read your skills as you learn more, some skills give you evasion or block, those can be used to mitigate incoming attack as well. This way you can survive in combat, and it is all about getting good at it. 
---
Some classes literally dance in between blades with their skills. In this game mobs can hit harder than you expect, so don't let them hit you.
---
not everyone has that. =)
---
The viscount area’s bad, sure.
---
But there’s a special place in hell for whomever kept luring him to the start of the time trial last night so people couldn’t mount up.

They are talking about the lack of roadmap. We have no idea what is coming down the track.

Yes, both the scarf and the crown are disappointments.

---
Eternal Ice makes it look like there is actually light emitting from inside.
---
Desert bl was never more popular than alpine. Theres still plenty of issues with warclaw even after the addition of lance, which doesn't even work against aegis aka any guardian. And lance was added a week or two ago.
---
I talk specifically about people LEAVING the game, not people criticising things.
---
BUt yeah, keep going with that: "We like the game more than you that is why we keep shitting on it all the time!!".
---
Every time they say "we are working on something, but it's gonna take a while" this sub staggers itself into a rampage about how it's indefensible that the content isnt already released. 
---
There's no point in saying it, so they might aswell save up the announcement hype for when its actually somewhat close to release.
---
&gt;nomad engineer
---
There is your problem.
---
With my Acro DD w/Shortbow and just 30% MF food I was averaging  about 600 bags/hr with bosses; probably would go much higher if my map ignored bosses, but I think they are fun and achievements are nice.
---
Next run I'll remember to bring boosts :)
---
/u/DantheAlcedo mind explaining why you think that this is an unpopular opinion?
---
Updated the post above and added a possible thief build though I could give suggestions on that too.
---
Sigil of Stamina is better choice; get swiftness from evades :)
---
Lunatic Court's "fun" room for misbehaved pesants?

Anet's on the way out, and it's bleeding talent.

Go with the greataxe, you can never go wrong with a greataxe
---
I disagree, reporting the toxic lab farmers is the most fun in an otherwise repetitive farm train
---
As a thief who worries about killing too quick, does the lower damage affect your ability to tag, for example instance will it take 3 arrows instead of 1?
---
I did the same before and here's mine.

We complaining about the seasonals now?
---
I'm interested.  If you're a member shoot me a PM and I'll join.  I enjoy the grind but I've never had a lucrative methOd
---
&gt; I don't understand.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; "Lost faith to Arenanet" for a long awaited official build templates?
---
They lost faith because Arenanet took a feature the community had already made - Told them to take it down and then slapped a price tag on it.
---
Yeah people are going to be pissed, you just made them pay for something they already had access to.
---
&gt; If you ever intend to make your own official DPS meter, I'm scared shitless of how that'd be implemented after this.
---
&gt; Fucking hell.
---
DPS meters not avaliable 800gems per/character.
---
I've been away from the game for almost a year, what's a fire brigade comp? Is that the firebrand/renegade combo?
---
I really don't get this. (Like why people get super toxic I mean) If you don't like how a comm is running hop instances, there are a crapton. Anyone who spends a good bit of time farming the event is going to have preferences that suit them best - read the lfg only join those groups and only stay with groups that don't annoy the crap out of you to roll with. Easy.
---
Most comms don't bring absolute max bags per hour anyway, most run an easy to maintain circuit with their preferred set of doors.
---
&gt; Erm...upkeep of the game? Dev Wages? New content?
---
Lmao it doesn't go to any of these things.
---
Dev wages are fixed, upkeep of the game is minimal compared to income.
---
The money goes to the people at the top, How are people still so naive that they don't understand that?
---
go for rune of speed aswell so swiftness gives 66% more speed instead of just 33
---
To save a lot of time for other people:
---
\- OP is in 2 guilds. Guild A and Guild B.
---
\- OP plays PvE with guild A since 2 years and made friends, ect.
---
\- OP plays WvW (GvG) with guild B, because Guild A is PvE only.
---
\- OP get kicked from Guild A, because he represented Guild B while fighting GvG.
---
\- OP only represent Guild B once a week for 2 hours.
---
\- OP want us to tell him, guildleader A is a bad guy.
---
So....if we stop paying, what happens to the game and the devs? Probably go offline and they lose their jobs. 
---
Or am I missing something?
---
Kraits are with Sea Dragon, so, with sea dragon we will deal with kraits
---
And guess what? I'm not playing GW1 now either! It's almost like these are different games.
---
That are leaving again*
---
Knock with mortars?
---
&gt; Holy moly, you have different build for every boss? Are they really needed?
---
Ye. You have mechanics like sloth removes conditions or maybe his druid drops out. On deimos he might be handkiting, on Samarog he probably wants longbow knockback etc.
---
&gt;I personally have used only two builds at raids: Axe condi mirage and power &lt;what I feel like playing today&gt; (holo/dd/weaver/dh). That's it. Create character -&gt; gear it -&gt; forget it.
---
Sure and that's fine but your stuck playing DPS and can't offer anything to assist in each encounter such as knocking back reds in VG, healing in VG, CCing in trio etc.
---
OP is more diverse and willing to fill the gaps in his team.
---
For clarity, does it increase the chance of tot bags dropping in general or just what's inside them?
---
&gt;WHICH IDIOT STEPPED IN THE BLACK AGAIN??? -&gt; check mechanics log-&gt; this guy.
---
I love this tool.
---
all this says about you is that youre a shitty dps player
---
This just in: fantasy mantas based on real mantas.
---
I hage that a$$hole!!! Leave me alone! I just want my candy corn!
---
you played dps instead of support and the boss took longer to kill?
---
the only logical conclusion would be that youre a bad dps player, not that youre a good support player.
---
Don't worry, the full lfg filter will be available on the gemstore as part of the convenience items!
---
&gt;  and they are also likely spending less money on gems than casuals.
---
I mean this is just an assumption. The only place we have data on this (Gw2 effeciency) says the complete opposite. It says the more hardcore players are spending more.
---
Even that's not reliable though as not every account is signed up.
---
good luck finding a cheaper way for minstrell
---
I thought about that but I figured I'd DPS the smaller mobs too fast.  Though, I'm sure the DPS would help with cleaning up those legendary bosses. This is the only time I use Scourge for farming, otherwise I love using my Reaper for everything else
---
I still have mine from years ago after I paid them a compliment in LA and received my "Happy meal." I will never delete it!
---
discord.gg/PTCp2tC
---
Care to explain why? A pumpkin is orange, deal with it.
---
&gt; because the burden falls upon such a small minority of players who will likely just up and leave for other games that have healthy, active raiding scenes
---
But the people who are "volatile" players of your game, opting to leave instead of spending more, those aren't the **target audience** to begin with.
---
You don't create your game for the non-spenders or the leavers, tbh. You create it for those splurging. Spending 30-50 or more each month. Those who compulsively got to have all the mount skins, all the weapons, everything. Those who cap out inventory on **every** character, and have &gt;20 of them.
---
Except you're a nobody who provides nothing to anyone.
---
Except our skimmers cant swim underwater
---
GS Mirage, Shortbow DD, ..., flamethrower engi far behind
---
Pretty sure mantas aren't real. Did you LOOK at these things?
---
Played full season as spellbreaker made the switch to core last week and my win rating improved a ton. Both are very good but core just feels overall more survivable while putting out big damage. Spellbreaker seems reliant on getting key interrupts to come out ahead.
---
Reporting them does absolutely nothing, so where's the fun in that?
---
i mean you could just answer them.. or stay under the waypoint so your tag doesn't show up on the map
---
I like how you ignore the topic entirely to focus on this. It enhances the experience.
---
I commanded lab last night and got trashtalked by some guy after I called him out for using raptor to engage mobs, even after specifically stating in LFG "No mounts, no bosses except Steve, commander opens doors" (because for real, some cunt will open the damn High Viscount and Lich doors). He said something like: "You have no right to tell me what I can use and what I can't, your elitist and toxic commander rules are shit as you." 
---
Well, the party just straight up laughed at him in squad chat and I told him to find a group that suits him in LFG. He dropped a big F bomb in chat and left. 
---
Don't always demonize the commander. You call me out, I will make you commander and see how you perform when leading a squad for 2 hours straight.
---
Ah, that makes sense, thanks for the clarification.
---
The OP is complaining about the players, not the commander. The commander is ultimately the one who dictates the pace of the lab farm. The OP *literally* could not be further from complaining about people trying to be efficient.
---
I'm still waiting for a skeleton boss with a trumpet 💀 🎺
---
While this is true there are a lot of commanders who post misleading or outright wrong info. I had 3 yesterday that said "Lab Farm. ALL DOORS!" and they skipped most of the doors citing "that's not what we are doing" after 5 minutes and we realized this we left. There is wrong on both sides.
---
"Now"?
---
They added two to raceway map.
---
probably an older message from previous comm and the new one didnt change it..
---
Yep. It's meta in fractals due to superior CC, DPS, and stability uptime. In raids, chrono+druid in one sub and fire brigade in another is very good as well, but most pugs still run double chrono and two healers.
---
fair point
---
What's the keyboard shortcut for the Shattered Observatory fractal jump skill?
---
I feel a lot of the mechanics would be a lot easier if I knew this.
---
This seems to be a weird desync issue. I've been doing it fine for the past years as well ( and with a way better ping ) but this year I had a problem with it. After a while, I noticed people who were up with me always jumped after I did, but somehow made it. What happens is the tower rotation is desynced from the actual rotation of the entrance spot. This means you're actually jumping against a wall, even if it looks like the clock, and others probably see you actually jumping too early/late, since this seems to be a client side issue. What helped me yesterday was exiting the JP and entering again. As soon as I did that I managed to do the jump 1st try again.
---
There's also two new collections in the Festival Collections category.
---
Well, 3 new collections but one is just "collect the new orange weapons for 5 ap" while the other two are "do various old content for new unique not-reskin weapon skins".
---
Bye
---
Hmm, this seems like something to try.
---
I am a very stubborn person so I refused to stop until I got it. Maybe exiting and re-entering would have helped. Thanks
---
STEVE!!!
---
Pay attention to the little round part that blasts out of the tower on the first jump. If it comes out smoothly, you're good to go. If it comes out, stops, then continues - or if it instantly appears out of nowhere - then you're desynced, so zone out and back in.
---
I mean, giraffes and unicorns...
---
Maybe Anet thinks the daily chest is making up for it?
---
Nah, he spends some time in the vaults of Zommoros’ mystic toilet too ^^
---
Exactly my thought. Well meme'd.
---
Oddly, for some reason I've bought the Bags of Starch from the cooking trainer.. but they don't appear in my Discovery panel  :\
---
Might be good that I can buy them!
---
Special action key? You can find it in your control options.
---
Because outdated rewards.
---
but i mean i can stay tagged up even if im not doing anything its mine after all...i payed for it...
---
It was a little jank (that first blowout piece section) so maybe that was the cause. Will try look out for this. 
---
FYI: nice username
---
&gt; I sometimes feel like I'm wasting time playing what I want rather than farming Istan or SW
---
Yeah, I try to keep in mind that the game exists to provide *fun* for you, not another job :) If you don't enjoy what you're doing in it, you will just burn out and leave, and all the grinding effort you put into GW2 is worth nothing outside of the game. So keep the fun/grinding balance sustainable!
---
can you do that outside of wvw yet??
---
Fingers crossed. I haven't tried today, will later and post how I got on. Couldn't finish it at all last night.
---
Thanks, yeah.
---
I have completed this JP in previous years many times. To clarify, I am jumping shortly after the lightning strikes, as you should. (I usually have to wait 2 rotations)
---
I just seemingly hit a wall.
---
My point is, a lot of the community has had a build template system with unlimited builds for free for almost 15 years provided by ArenaNet, and yet they can’t do the same in the sequel. 
---
Don’t be a dickhead.
---
(everyone in open world is running a solo build, the best thing you can take to the stroike or leggy bounties and such is always a boonslave)
---
GiT GuD
---
It's a festival. I had no expectations, there are a few new races to enjoy (Bunny &amp; Jackal) which is neat.
---
No.
---
If you choose "Enraged and Unashamed" in the vigil story, Baroosh teaches the other quaggan in the village to go rage mode during Evacuation.
---
They will float underwater in a wall formation, and go all rage at the same time.
---
You won't have to do much, they will thrash the Icebrood as the transformation gives them bonus stats. If you choose the other option, the quaggan do not last much against icebrood.
---
It’s a pumpkin. It’s meant to orange.
---
I'm 26 and can easily say that my 8 year old self would be better at jumping puzzles and time trial stuff than current me.
---
I had way more patience for fiddly jumps when I was that age, for sure.
---
It's automatically bound to your special action key. You might need to rebind it to something convenient to hit because of how necessary it is.
---
You can click on the trade post and type in "seven reapers" and they will all be there.
---
I'll be honest I'm not that clued up about seasonal events and their vendors, I don't really partake.
---
try re installing it?
---
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way to a worse game!
---
Thank you for the heads up!
---
Haven't experienced this on EU. In fact, I've only ever seen a few people speak at all. EU can be boring at times.
---
Your hyperbole is ridiculous. Just leave if you hate the game so much.
---
Reads out your DPS in chat every 25% of the bosses health like in the training area, nothing more.
---
All you need is the muscle memory to kick in, needed only 2 tries to get it this year.
---
Don't have them.
---
Wonder when furry fox ears are returning
---
Yeah, it doesnt make a lot of sense, especially considering the wintersday JP is much easier.
---
Although IMO clocktower is more fun to run, even when I just started it and failed, a lot. Its different compared to any other JP. Winstersday JP is a dime in a dozen and boring as shit.
---
The chance that they drop
---
Lab raiders are toxic. This content wasn't there at the beginning of the game and now that they have added it the game has become so toxic and unfriendly, tbh they should just delete it and the gph-meters. &gt;:(
---
Yeah, it wasn't released with a living world and they don't have to keep making living world stuff. They don't have to keep making anything. Raiders should be happy they got raids at all since they didn't come out for years.
---
You've paid for the game already and this is it. Everything that came with the expansions has been paid for. If you continue to buy gems and pay into the game that's up to you but that doesn't entitle you or anyone anything more.
---
The devs add in features and people whine, they add new content and people whine. So much bitching and moaning like small children who didn't get the color balloon they wanted when the balloon was free.
---
No. I'm acting on what's a fair and reasonable setup for a new system. Each character having  3 templates is the very bare logical minimum for those who have gone without. 
---
Not even providing that is indicative of greedy miscalculated monetization.
---
Ive encounter this but honestly don't remember what fixed it. I'm just typing to let you know it did happen to others.
---
It does make sense and its exactly what most games do, especially multiplayer PC games. 
---
EVERY single game has a larger casual audience than top-end players. Yet you look at wow or ffxiv and they invest heavily into raids. You look at lol and they literally run a deficit on esports, the top 0.0001% of millions of dollars a year. And balance their game around them.
---
And yet, they're vastly more succesful than gw2. Each of these games has far more casual players than gw2... despite not exclusively catering to them.
---
It makes sense, financially, to listen to your most hardcore fans who create value, hype, external economies and products for your game for free.
---
Just like discord voice chat quality goes to shit since the day they added the paid version.
---
It's actually much worse than that. Half of the clocktower rewards are  in the 3 chests on the way up. These 3 do not respawn every run, meaning that you have to switch characters after every run if you want full rewards. Combine that with the fact that you have to leave maps with less than two minutes left on the clock, you spend more time in loading screens and the lobby than actually jumping. Also you get more gifts than clocktower by solofarming the center of the Labyrinth. It's a joke.
---
"*For those unaware, the rewards for last years clock tower were 5 Trick or Treat bags after the first clear. Many (me amongst them) considered this to be to low for what is one of, if not the hardest jumping puzzles in the game*" -[me, 11 Oct 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/75oxl1/a_reminder_about_last_years_halloween/)
---
This has been an issue for literally, at least, the last 3 years. There is absolutely no justification for this, as even doubling the reards would probably still make it a far less appealing farm than the labyrinth. As with many old content there is a chance that they actually cannot change the code (which would be hillariously pathetic), but apart from actual technical limitations there simply is no valid explanation for not updating festival rewards to account for changes in the game. 5 bags was *okay* 5 years ago, because the labyrinth still had diminishing returns and later on you had a year long ToT bag farm with Vial of Maize Balms. But with diminishing returns being disabled and "Ascend to Madness" coming back into the game, the jumping puzzle is by a very, very, *very* long shot the least rewarding content for Halloween.

Took 2 hours for me, 1 hour of which was spent learning the damn thing. Afterwards I could get a steady 3-4 completes per round.

Was it not good enough for her to flex her wintersday jumping puzzle skills.. she's gotta make me feel bad about clock tower too?  😭

I don't agreen
---
Also remember, you don't have to play the game if you don't like it anymore. There are lots of other games out there and it's good to take a break and get a new perspective from time to time.

Take note. ^ This is what raiders unironically believe. inb4 more raiders talk about the infamous blue-geared boogeyman that doesn't exist.

Thank you for quite literally proving my point. :D

What's a little upsetting to see is, they constructed the new Jackal mount skin's head perfectly to blend it with it's look. They could've done the same with the Charr head. We had different looks for the Frosty Crown between the races. (If you want a reference to the new Jackal skin, refer to that_shaman's data mine post yesterday)
---
Yes but fire vs foefire.
---
Because they’re once against pissing off their hardcore players and barely anyone is going to be buying templates. Casuals won’t be. This whole thing makes no sense.
---
It automatically restarts when you enter the chest room, players don’t have control when to start a round.

I suggest using Ayn Maiden for your guides.

Mb, I'll go back to sitting in a pug group for 9 hours, not complaining that the kid who joined with 500 AP is doing 1000 DPS and is messing up every mechanic causing our wipes.
---
People like you are the issue, raiders aren't toxic, they just know what is beneficial to group content, if someone is MASSIVELY bringing the group down raiders are willing to bite the bullet and tell you you're shit.
---
Telling you you're shit isn't the be all end all, and whiny PvE kids like you can't grasp that we're telling you because YOU SHOULD KNOW AND IMPROVE.

A good point. Incapacitate, then.

It's a pumpkin, and we can dye the flame colour. This is absolutely fine, honestly.

If you're in a squad, the amount of damage you do really doesn't matter, as long as you've dealt a single hit the damage of your squad will add to yours for the purpose of qualifying for loot.  If you're not in a squad, then this bow won't do enough damage in all likelihood.
---
This is the most cat thing I've seen today.
---
It's dumb and I love it.
---
F, thanks ANet. For everything. Everything you did to the Guild Wars universe.
---
I didn't buy this game back in 2012 with the idea that they would abandon dungeons. I doubt anyone did, most people who buy into MMO's expect actual content that's improved over time and expanded not straight up abandoned. 
---
And no everything else isn't extra or free, I paid for that shit too, the money I and many others put into the game went into developing those things so I don't really know where you are getting this free nonsense from.
---
Wait, I thought this was the friendliest community.
---
Wow, that guy was rude. Does the term "elitist" even mean anything anymore with this community? It's obvious why a group would forbid mounts in the labyrinth...it has obviously has nothing to do with elitism...
---
It's amazing that such toxicity exists in such a casual and cooperative part of the game like the labyrinth.
---
I mean, it's a jack-o-lantern. There's supposed to be light emitting from the inside?
---
Check for [Gw2fans.net](www.gw2fans.net) This is new site. It’s still under construction but i think it is worth to check.
---
RIP, tried today and worked first time. Damn my stubbornness.
---
I'll give you the link for 2 gold.
---
Most colors don't make that impression.
---
If it doesn't involve the gem store or new content as a vehicle for new gem store items, it's not a priory. I'm sorry if it hurts people's feelings, but it's the truth.
---
What link?

&gt; I'd like to see your complete collection of all gemstore items

---
&gt; Cool and I'm one of the people who values his time and money. And if the game is (has) going into maintenance mode I feel that its time to move on.
---
Then move on and stop just saying you're going to as some kind of threat to the developers. 
---
&gt;Well you're the one moaning here love. Like. A. Bitch.
---
I'm not, but I can see how someone like you would think that. You can't help yourself. You want attention and when someone calls you out on it you project onto others.
---
&gt;Yes indeed how dare people ask for features to be properly implemented or to be reasonably priced (for example I've said it numerous time, I'd pay an expansion level price for a PROPER implementation with a much larger number of templates rather than this shite) rather than be a mobile-game like cash grab. How dare they!
---
That's your entitlement speaking. Everything should be made for you, catered to you and when that doesn't happen you just spew hatred and vitriol.
---
&gt;Well given that the competition seems to do a much better job of the said updates, yeah in a reasonably competitive market... They need to do better.
---
Then go to the competition. Anet doesn't owe you anything. You bought their game and their expansions and you've received them, everything else has been extra and free. No one is making you spend more money on this game, no one is keeping you here, and there's no subscription to pay into.
---
&gt;They can want whatever they ahem want. If they want people to pay them they need to provide good features and not something cobbled together at the 11th hour.
---
Again, you don't have to pay for anything else.
---
&gt;Anet is a company. A company I might add with a far below par performance for the last 2 years. If you're not sure why I say that - look at the recent events, the layoffs, people leaving of their own accord etc. What they are doing is clearly insufficient. And it is the decisions like the in the current topic that are a large part of the cause.
---
&gt;The people working for anet will find other jobs, or they will not. I'm sorry but they are just people and I frankly don't care what happens to them but the current management is going to sink the company and the game along with it.
---
Yes, you've established you don't care about the company or it's employees and you just want them to cater to you.
---
&gt;So is it sad that some people here are older than you or is it sad that the said people want something more than what the company is providing? Which is it?
---
It's sad your reading comprehension is so low. It's sad that 2 seconds hovering over my name will tell you my age range. It's sad that you can't act like an adult for 2 seconds because you're too engrossed in yourself.
---
&gt;Glad we agree.
---
Glad you agree that everything I said about you is also true.
---
&gt;Oh no no, that is really not the reason.
---
Yes, it's obvious that someone so engrossed in them self as you are wouldn't be able to understand that.
---
&gt;What easymode third party addon are we talking about? I'm sure we were talking about buildtemplates and not a bot or a hack of some sort here.
---
To deny the addon gives you a benefit is to deny any reason to use the addon at all and completely destroys all your arguments to keep it.
---
&gt;So far the only truth you managed was when you admitted to being a prick :) I'm pretty sure I'm happy to hear that.
---
Typical childish statement from someone acting like a child. Really couldn't expect anything better from you. Sad.
---
Don't know if you (and the people who upvoted) are just joking around or if you don't know that the core warrior sPvP build is called, so just in case: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Warrior_-_Greataxe
---
Off topic, but what’s you’re other gear? Please and ty!
---
I think it's fairly safe to assume you don't raid, as you have so much vehement toxicity pointed at raids as previously implied by you;
---
&gt;Raiders: Treat raids like their own insular clubhouse and grow increasingly toxic and unwelcoming to the PvE crowd at large  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Also Raiders: Act surprised when Anet doesn't support an area of the game that has almost no playerbase.  
---
&gt;Also also raiders: Act indignant when Anet wants development of a MOD shut down, something they are perfectly within reason to do.
---
You can play the double standard all you want and and make inflammatory attempts at baiting but at the end of the day, you're going in circles.
---
&gt; about how everyone is bad 
---
Also you didn't read, which is kinda sad
---
&gt;Telling you you're shit isn't the be all end all, and whiny PvE kids like you can't grasp that we're telling you because YOU SHOULD KNOW AND IMPROVE.
---
why wouldn't you? I certainly do. I'd like to own all the skins and make an effort to collect them but I certainky dont use them all.
---
Old old fart; this is totally undoable....
---
1. Put a target on the real mes, if they go in stealth try to mark them once they got out. Nothing really else you can do other than paying extra attention to its behavior.
---
2. My advice for the rev vs thief matchup has always been the same. Try to be the more aggressive one from start. Even though thief naturally counters rev, when you take the upper hand in this 1v1 you surely win! When facing stealthed thieves try to use unrelenting assault and then gaze of darkness to land a guaranteed reveal, this leaves the thief super vulnerable and you can finish them off quite easily as they don’t expect to get revealed most times. (A good way to approach this 1v1 would be: Phase Traversal-&gt; UA-&gt;Legend Swap-&gt;Gaze of Darkness-&gt;Glint Elite-&gt;Sword 2/Surge of the Mist).
---
3. As you noted yourself, infuse light isn’t meant to be a heal really but more some kind of invulnerability. When you can expect big dps or chain dps definitely use it, even when your health is okay, because in most cases as you said yourself player bait it out or won’t attack you when you used it, so always try to use it when you feel like you can avoid big damage with it.
---
Also using it allows you to go extra aggressive which can help you getting the upper hand in a fight as I noted earlier. However don’t waste it too easy!
---
4. now what you mentioned is exactly what separates good players from bad. They know with every skill they use/press what they do with it.
---
To get there you need to learn that less is more. You should not spam everything you got on your bar, pay attention to your opponents movement, positioning, cooldowns.
---
You want every skill that you use to hit (unless you want to fail some intentionally) that’s why don’t spam and panic use any heavy hitting skills (for example when blinded or when the foe is blocking/invulnerable) so that you miss them.
---
For example when doing that vs a rev he‘d use that to his advantage and use infuse light.
---
Don’t dodge just any attack, try to dodge key skills instead of any weak autoattack.
---
Try to be more in control of your skills, you should figure out what every single skill on your bar does and how to use it to its most potential. Same goes for your sigils.
---
The specific instance is just "search for Balthazar at his war camp", where defeating the Bastion is the trigger for "regroup ...".
---
As you can see, couldn't defeat the Bastion on low health. My point being yes I know there are checkpoints but they didn't/don't help here.
---
Yeah so the Spooky Mounts Pack was actually the first mount skin pack released after PoF. They probably just made the descriptions of the newer skin packs more clear without going back and changing it in the older ones. Anet - Consistently Inconsistent.
---
The one that symbolizes Halloween is *David* Pumpkins.
---
Everyone knows that.
---
I mean... black is technically the absence or absorption of visible light... red should show as light though.
---
Thank you for clarifying. It's a little confusing. And was tempting, gotta grind some golds for that griffon I guess.

You'r welcome

&gt;but otherwise has no oversight.
---
Delta works closely with anet on this project. Its not about trusting Delta. And don't belittle the ability of tens of thousands of users playing for thousands of errors in testing the app. Thats more hours than almost any piece of commercial software gets of QA. The fear is totally irrational, and anyone who cites it is either a victim of FUD or spreading it themselves intentionally.
---
No problem! Good luck on the griffon :)
---
&gt;whiny PvE kids like you
---
You don't know a damn thing about me, but instead have revealed to everyone on this sub your own mentality. According to you no one who has raided before can have ANY critique on raiders. No no not because they have seen first hand what raiders do to other players, instead they MUST be another trash blue-gear boogeyman. 
---
It is me the raider who is right and the world that is wrong.
---
ok champ, You have already openly shown disdain for the rest of the PvE playerbase at a mere drop of a hat and are unaware of how clearly you have displayed it. No fucking wonder nobody wants to raid with you and no wonder anet doesn't care to support raids. :D
---
*Facepalm*
---
There is a difference between squash and pumpkin.
---
A typical pumpkin is yellow to orange or going into pale brown tones. It's part of the squash family. 
---
But most plants on this picture are squashes but not necessarily pumpkins.
---
But overall a typical Jacko lantern is made with a typical orange-yellow pumpkin.
---
I had the same problem yesterday. Failed final jump 10 times, then i switched character and instance and it worked.
---
Global cd is a deal breaker for me , makes combat feel static
---
The top and skirt, at least, look like the [Sylvari light T3 cultural armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dryad_armor).
---
Thanks for this, I found myself commanding for a short time last night and wasn't sure I was following the right path. Later, when following another commander I noticed he was missing a lot of mobs but didn't want to complain. At least now I'll know if I'm following someone if they're doing it efficiently or not and if I have to command I'll remember where to go now.
---
What issues were resolved? 
---
Desert bl is still not equal to alpine, although i actually like it. And tbh it creates 1 less map which condenses population, which is already low on numbers.
---
Warclaw will never be fixed until it's removed and that will never happen.... Hell i could compromise and say it's going to be fine, when it has 1hp and no dodges, but i know that is not going to happen.
---
As for matchup manipulation... I don't even know when was last time anyone had so much will to do it. Hell, even if some sort of server council would decide, it wouldn't mater as there would only be 10 people to receive the memo....
---
Last time I checked there was no restrictions on depositing anything in the bank, even if it was soulbound.
---
Maybe you are trying to deposit in your guild bank? Maybe you don't have permission to deposit there, or you do have permission, but the item is bound to the character or the account.
---
Does the flame blast center on you or the target hit?
---
I've changed my traits to basically all trap escapes and reduction so now even my short bow really does very little damage.
---
&gt; Delta works closely with anet on this project.
---
ANet does not QA check the releases or stand by them. The fact that someone worked closely with a company to make a mod in the first place does nothing to assuage fears that malicious code can be injected into it later without anyone realizing it. Note that I'm not saying this is likely or accusing Delta of anything, but I am saying that calling this fear irrational is silly. It's perfectly reasonable to look at these two software packages and conclude that one is unquestionably safer than the other.
---
&gt; And don't belittle the ability of tens of thousands of users playing for thousands of hours in testing the app.
---
First, that's at least two or three orders of magnitude less than the number of users testing GW2. Second, every time there is an update, all that previous testing for safety really can't be guaranteed. You can trust that ANet won't slip a virus or keylogger into their next update because there will be definite real-world legal consequences for such a thing. The same cannot be said of a mod update, one that is specifically labeled as "use at your own risk". 
---
 &gt; LOL. Holy shit dude. I point out the silliness of changing the definition of third party software and your defense for it is to change the definition of first party software so the third party goal post moves. Amazing.
---
No, my "defense" of it is to point out that your objections to this definition are at least two decades too late, because **I** did not change the definition of what "third party software" means to gamers. I searched for "third party software in gaming", and look, the 2nd result was this: 
---
https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848-Third-Party-Applications
---
Oh look, exactly the definition I am talking about: "Competitive games work because each player is afforded the same amount of information about the game and other players. **Third-party applications are programs or files that aren't part of League of Legends.**"
---
"Third party developers" are not the same as "third party software" when you're talking about PC games. The latter has, for years, referred to things like bots, hacks, cheats, overlays, video capture software, etc.
---
As someone who's taken over a commander-less squad in SW I have done this, and It's because I didn't realize the LFG stays after I take over so...
---
Muh bad ya'll
---
Wasnt templates supposed to 'no longer be updated' instead of turn off?
---
Fuckin yikes omegaLUL
---
You again, assume I'm all for ONLY raiders and I'm against PvE, let me take your pity card and play it.
---
You don't know a damn thing about me, but have instead revealed to everyone on this sub your own mentality.
---
I've always openly shown disdain for the PvE players who don't give the game a second thought on how to actually enjoy and play it.
---
Yet at the same time, you assume with your big boi pants that I'm just another big toxic raider scapegoat.
---
Even though I've put in the days and weeks and months and years into putting effort into teaching others in raid trainings, two full guilds and constant HP trains.
---
I've stayed up countless hours helping other players get their goals done and get them into Raid, Fractals, WvW and PvP
---
I've called my friends on their shit, and they've been through me being "toxic to them", at least they understand why and don't cry over it, they take it to heart and actually improve, and thank me for it later.
---
There's no improvement in coddling, in real life or in-game.
---
This isn't about me being "toxic" towards others, your day is dead set on pissing some random raider on reddit off.
---
Take your fuckin egotistical power trip out of here, because you're just a toxic PoS and you're not worth anyone's fucking time.
---
You really don't know what you are talking about right?
---
WvW, PvP, Raids, Fractals....
---
Especially WvW and PvP, which were huge before and after years of neglect lost most of their population.
---
Ofc now there are people claiming that PvE is 90% of population, but well, that wasn't the case before and i assure you if pve was negleced as competitive modes you wouldn't see that many people there.
---
This is the reason I've never tried to do the darn jp after several failed attempts.
---
Is there any other way to start the season, really?
---
There is a personal story.
---
Every race has a different personal story up to level 30, this is when you choose your order. Every order (Vigil, priory and whispers) has their own story. After this story step you can select one of the minor races to study/aid (selection is based on your race) which results in different story steps. After that the story is the same until it's conclusion in Arah.
---
After this come the living world story/quest lines and the expansion questlines. These are the same for everyone.
---
Well, that was GW2 kinda, until 2015.
---
Do the heart quests all around the map, then story when available. Also points of interest and other things on the map.
---
Yeah right..
---
I agree, Mr. Martionlabs should fuck off because he's a nobody who provides nothing useful
---
The personal story offers three questlines per race, then the orders give another three and everything comea together at late level 60/70, the story after that point is one story, however the race and backstory of your char will still be relevant for details. A rough estimate would be 15 unique personal story lines, and three for the order part of your story. Barring the choices made within the story, which influence which missions you play in a single chapter.
---
So exactly like dude from website OP posted
---
1 is all it takes
---
Yea, one of my fill raiders said his main static fell apart last night too.
---
Yea, it's gross. Like "I don't have your problem so I won't attempt to understand it. Fuck you for having your fun ruined."
---
That gets challenging when you hit weird fights like deimos though, so I don't know. I'm not even entirely convinced that's an option in most cases.
---
People use food in t4s?
---
why it's says there is no gw2-64 next to folder ?

---
Yes. Lab farming must be literally the worst content in game.
---
Well, if someone has a hands kiter toon then that's fine. Switching on the fly just became a giant hassle.
---
food, enrichments, the halloween "oils" that give some MF...
---
I can't comment on whether it is gw2 specific or not, as the only mmo I played besides gw2 was runescape a few years before, and 2 data points isn't a lot lol. Although I can certainly say that back when I played, runescape rarely had so much clashing between different playstyle.  Probably because gw2 is a casual game, but the sequel to a very different game.  While runescape had sorta always been a grindy/hardcore game (back when I played it).
---
Except at first you said "pumpkins are orange", not "jack-o-lanterns are orange". ;)
---
It's kind of complicated. There are a ridiculous number of skins in this game, so almost any question of "is there a good amount of x?" will get a yes. There are tons of easy to acquire skins, there are tons of very difficult to acquire skins, there are tons of gemstore skins.
---
Having every skin in the game is completely unattainable for anyone but the most elite of the player base, but you can aim your play time to the kinds of skins you like. The wiki is an amazing resource for tracking down cosmetics you like or finding out how hard it is to get something.
---
Does that make sense?
---

---
This!
---
I was kinda nervous about joining the madness after all the salt I saw here a few years back...but after trying it, it's very true that the vast majority of groups just have a few simple etiquette guidelines:
---
-	Don't use mount combat skills
---
-	Don't get out ahead of the commander
---
-	 Let the commander do all the door opening
---
-	 If you don't like how the commander is doing things, you're free to find another group that you like better
---
 That's really about it. Beyond that it's courtesy to tag mobs as little as practicable then move to the next, giving others a chance to tag it as well...but that's as much in your own interests as the group's.
---
I've seen it argued that you should be using a weak weapon, non-meta build, etc. But imho that's more trouble than its worth, and doesn't have much practical effect at the end of the day...plus the bosses can hit hard, so it's nice to be able to stand your ground.
---
if you like 1v1 like me. best place to practice is in the mist open arena (PvP lobby).
---
LOL
---
I know it makes me terrible, but I only use Privateer runes, because I love the randomly-appearing Parrot.

How can I get that skin?

clearly its a fake. wait needs to be more blurry and out of focus

Materials have a material deposit, which isn't exactly your bank. The bank itself is something you have to manually store things into.
---
Tell me since when ascent to madness is a 10 man content ? You don't even apply any logic to your comment and try to pretending you have the same as mine lol.  
---
Ascent to Madness is a mini-dungeon. Secret Lair of the Snowmen is a mini-raid, strikes are mini-raids and right now i don't see any differences between the 2.

Hello

you can check this site  [https://www.gw2fans.net/inpage/shadow-of-the-mad-king-2019/](https://www.gw2fans.net/inpage/shadow-of-the-mad-king-2019/)  I am working on it right now and i hope It will be done still today!
---
thank you for not saying the word ass, this is a christian subreddit
---
You could be right. That's a strange interpretation in my eyes, given how labyrinth works but some people have different mindsets when they go into it I guess.
---
Ive been here 7yrs this Xmas and payed 9.2k hours and honestly the only toxic players I come across are usually in PvP/WvW  and high level fractals and raids.  Other than that I've never played another game with so many nice and helpful players.

Never heard of him before today and neither have most of the community so my contribution of a positive attitude and recommendation that people stop being such doomsayers over stupid shit is a much greater contribution than his.

not offended, just think it was a hack joke

when you wrote that comment were you like ‘haha I really came up with a funny joke here!’ ?

How is that more effective when there's literally one thing I want to know which takes 3 seconds to check with the mechanics log tool?

I'm like 90% sure I'm a different Fennec, lol.
---
This isn't a right/wrong situation, its just a split of views, and trust me...I am loaded with unsavory opinions xD
---
They shouldn’t be monetizing gameplay mechanics - because imo build templates are indeed a gameplay mechanic. 
---
6/24 templates at launch would have been fantastic, but now years later I don’t think it’s enough to support the needs of hard core players. I hope they rethink/expand the system in the next months to cater towards the players of today, not yesterday.
---
Ty!
---
Touche.
---
As a zerg minstrel scrapper who gets caught by mirages and proceeds to hit and die like a wet noodle, I applaud your victory. Terrain seems so so important in this game at all scales -- watching zergs die outnumbered 2 to 1 because they walked into an ugly choke is always something to see.
---
Has it been discovered how one unlocks these?
---
They do a lot of damage and reduce the # of peoplewho can tag stuff
---
Shilling? How is telling people to calm the fuck down "shilling"?
---
The one and only time, one channel is the correct choice.
---
Are you using a bank or a guild bank? Make sure you’re at a bank!
---
Careful there, someone might get angourd...
---
I don't understand why you've been downvoted, as you are correct. 
---
A commander does not own the instance. It is a public instance and people can join ad hoc. And people can do as they please in a public instance. 
---
I'm completely with OP. Lab farmers are motivated by greed more than anything else, to the point where it is grotesquely toxic and very off-putting.  I kinda wish the lab was removed from the game. But if it were, you'd have a very salty Reddit with a bunch of Ferengi-inspired farmers complaining about muh profits.
---
If you want to earn gold, you're not supposed to open them, you're supposed to sell them on the Trading Post to other suckers who want to open them.
---
If you open them, you're gambling to try to get one of the super-rare drops.  There's a reason they're called super-rare drops, they're super-rare.  Unless you're absurdly lucky, you'll come up short opening them, so it's better to sell them for the guaranteed silver/gold and let other people suffer.

I can’t stop laughing at this!  Lmao

I didn't know they were unkillable.
---
You want as many people in the train as possible to get tags so everyone gets loot. Running up on your raptor doing 1/2 the HP of a group defeats the purpose. It's just courtesy so other people get loot too.

They are killable, but they take too long. By the time we kill Viscount we could've farmed 30 bags.

I play sine GW2 launch (was it 2012? don't remember), but for like good 2 years already i just log in to play harp and run around the city and talk with friends, don't remember when I killed a mob tho. Bought GW1 via Steam recently, it's nice to play someties when You have nothing to do.
---
I hate repeating myself, if you are seriously pulling a "I don't believe you cause xyz" then just cut the shit and scroll further. You weren't even there so you can't testify anything solid to defend some delusional guy who hated the idea of someone asking him not to use mounts. 
---
I won't defend my squad, but if you consider "LOLZ, xD, :D, hahahahaha" and similar as toxic laughter then that is I suppose your view. No one was particularly offensive but I suppose the situation looked like some school bullying. I will call it on that and be done.
---
Fare thee well.
---
The oath and membership was for life the only way out is too reveal Shining blades secret.
---
Your not telling anyone to calm down.
---
He made a post explaining why hes not continuing working on an addon and you got pissy about it.

Maybe this will help? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZJztkaREMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZJztkaREMU)
---
The entire combat isn't restricted by the global cooldown as much as people suggest imo, it's fun to combo weave in between the global cooldown skills, with the skills that aren't restricted to the global cooldown. Think of it like multiple gw2 1-1-1 combo while having access to every utility skill for your class to buff those combos. Yea feels static in the early levels. It's not gw2 fun combat, but it's much better at the higher levels.
---
Really? You don't see anything wrong with a trait that applies 2 stacks of poison on a 2 second icd? That trait made condi thief go from extremely situational to extremely meta in 1 patch, especially when combined with the other Deadly Arts traits. 
---
Condi Thief is literally ruining every PvP match right now, and it's rancid how they aren't fixing it. Like I said, they play favorites and Thief apparently is one. When they reworked Berserker back in April, they immeditely hotfixed a nerf that lowered Arc Divider damage. Condi Thief gets massive buffs and it becomes super broken and makes the game miserable to play? Nothing.
---
Deadly Ambition needs some serious nerfs. Just something like increasing the duration and ICD, but lowering the stacks from 2 to 1 would help. Right now, if you aren't playing a build that can cleanse every 2 seconds, you're going to have a horrible time. It's because of this stupid trait that I'm forced to play Tempest every game because none of my other favorite classes can come close to dealing with broken ass Thief.
---
The balance team in this game is horrible.
---
"for life"
---
That is what I mean. We were not alive xD
---
We tried to ask that in a AMA with a narrative dev but the most favorite Quggan was more important
---
&gt; Moral of the story, if you're a self-entitled douche, be ready for the repercussions.
---
Unless that person has a stronger will and more time to kill..... like you right? Best way to teach those toxic assholes a lesson is to be a asshole right back at them! At least thats the morale of your story as I read it.
---
GW2 community is friendly until you need to get a group to do anything other than the simplest cognitive tasks. Hence why raids and PvP are complained about the most. WvW's the only one that requires more thinking but is far less toxic overall because of how its structured.
---
&gt; Can you link the item please? 
---
I guess this is meant: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Urn_of_%22Heroic%22_Ashes
---
It does not say it's yours, though.
---
&gt;we also need veteran developers who have been here from the start, who know the lore like the back of their hand
---
You mean like Bobby Stein who has been here and working with the lore for over 10 years?
---
Ahhhhh, so thats what it was... familiar looking, haha, Jeez, thats sneaky.
---
Let's say a given individual mob has 100 HP (just for ease of maths). 
---
A standard AA from a properly kitted out build for open world might deal 15-20 hp damage, so 5-6 hits. 
---
In perfect circumstances, that's 5-6 people who can each get full loot from that mob if each of them hits it once.
---
A "Zerg farming build" attempts to neuter this damage somewhat, so maybe your AA deals out 5 damage. If everyone does this (and again everyone hits exactly once), that's 20 people instead of 5-6 who are getting loot.
---
Figure maybe half the people use a farm build, so maybe roughly 10-12 people can get a hit in on an average mob. Call it 10, for the people who AA twice.
---
Then there's the guy who comes in and uses the raptor to bunch up and engage the mobs. He's probably got a cleaving AA on him as well, and geared and traited for max damage.
---
His raptor hits for 50 and he AAs twice for his version of "tagging", dealing 20 damage with each AA. That's 90 damage in seconds from one guy, so that leaves basically one hit on every mob in that group, split among everyone else. 
---
He's taking 90% of the available tags and getting the exact same loot as if he'd only taken 1%. Meanwhile, there's 8 other people out there who could have tagged it that are getting nothing.
---
Another way of looking at it is that, as a group, you want each mob to generate the maximum amount of drops. To do that you want to maximize the number of people who hit that mob at least once. Big attacks do nothing except take away the opportunity for that mob to generate more loot.
---
Yes but were brought back. When I say for life I think what I meant to say is till the shining blade brutally murder us for breaking one of their secrets we are stuck as a member. It just doesn't have any effects on story. Its essentially like being the commander after HoT its a title and doesn't effect the story.
---
With Desmina in our debt it doesnt really matter.
---
Well no, because the painting is 100% painted by me. Though I appreciate your caution towards art theft. :)
---
I'm running a standard raid dps Daredevil so that i deal extremely high damage to the bosses, so i don't have the swiftness on dodge trait. The idea behind this shortbow was just to have my weaponswap key work as a toggle between extremely high dps for bosses, and extremely low damage for tagging trash enemies without instantly killing them, so that everyone can tag.
---
year late?
---
I mean I have 8+ builds across all gamemodes if they’re simplified down. 
---
Hammer Herald (WvW) 
---
Roaming Herald (WvW) 
---
Condi Roaming Herald (WvW)
---
Alacrity Diviner (fractals raids) 
---
Condi Ren (fractals raids) 
---
Heal Ren/Herald (fractals raids) 
---
 Handkiter Herald (fractals raids) 
---
Berserker Herald (fractals raids) 
---
Open world Herald (open world) 
---
Open World Condi Ren (open world) 
---
So new build templates will absolutely suck for those of us that play only/mostly 1 character. And I’m not even nearly as hardcore as some people and I easily hit the 6 equipment template cap.
---
Been playing and leading a guild since GW1 release...  That being said, I only know one other person from my GW1 days.  Many in my guild been active for over 5 years.  I really don't have a reason to log on outside of content releases of it wasnt my guild.  It's sad Anet seems to not realize how important communities and community focused content are to keep people logging in.
---
Pretty casual about the game the past 7 years and have just 4 or 5 achievements in finished.  Many of us MMO players grew up, got kids, have careers.  Still enjoy the game.  
---
It really is a MMO for adults. It is really low maintenance game.  However, If this was 10 or so years ago.  I'd be playing something else.
---
Just dealt with that this morning. Screw that guy
---
C:
---
Ah. Iam sorry. I wasn't supposed to play more than a build on a character, or think that anets Templates are worse than a random guys 5kb DLL file.
---
For a single character, perhaps. With multiple characters, the math changes radically fast.
---
Also don't discount having access to material storage everywhere. It has more uses than people think.
---
I still played with 5 or 6 builds even back before templates, so for some of us certainly we would have experimented and had multiple builds still
---
Beta weekend GW2 player here. I used to be a hardcore RPer and didn't play a lot of the game modes but now that I've returned to the game I'm trying everything out. 
---
I joined an awesome guild and I'm doing fractals, WvW, working on maxing every crafting prof (I'm 450+ on all of them so pretty close!!), wanna craft a legendary and get full ascended armor for my fractal character. Also recently got skyscale so that was great. :D
---
Overall just having a ton of fun tbh. Oh and of course Fashion Warz forever.
---
Well so far it only has been doom and gloom, I can't remember a single positive thing that came out the big ass layoffs. Because Icebrood saga aint it man.
---
 gw2's current big issues don't have anything to do with the lore lmao
---
What happened to all that uproar against monetizing core feature of the game? Arenanet will not respond if we dont keep it up and show that we are not satisfied. These things needs to be addressed or Arenanet will keep going with predatory MTX and encourage gambling.
---
To use /s or not to use /s that is the question!
---
Yeah but they could've rolled it into PoF masteries. Nice to have confirmation that they're not making that mistake.
---
I'm sorry you didn't understand the point of my comment. The job it's doing is to make you frustrated. You seem frustrated so it's doing it's job even now.
---
That is the best possible hat they could've given them and I love it
---
I think the guy that needs to swap the build per boss is shit at the game because he can't complete beaindead easy content with 4.76 less crit chance or only 90% Boon uptime...
---
&gt; You could easily flip it around.
---
Bringing it back to something I said before.
---
 I guess the point is the "whos a cunt" train starts and stops in many places and anyone from a random player, commander, squad noob or w/e can ride the cunt train.
---
&gt;I don't even slightly see the issue...
---
Others can see you as the "cunt" because you are popping doors and fucking up how they want to play the game. Just like you can see them as the "cunt" because they want you to play for the betterment of the group dont say it in a nice way and thus fucking up how you want to play. Depending on where you stand either side is the "cunt" or maybe both, or maybe neither. This whole "You do not get to tell me what to do in the game." doesnt exclude anyone from being a "cunt".
---
&gt; he makes a post prophesying the doom of the game and refusing to finish his work
---
Imagine being this entitled, it's not his work. It's something he did for the community and it worked fine, not sure what your on about with "Never finished."
---
It didn't need updating, so he didn't update it - Duh.
---
I assumed that to be graphical limitations since you show no marks of injury from the fireball to the face. Either way, commander died and the body rises from the ground in a swirl of divine light after you successfully murder a soul eater in the underworld. 
---
We are aware of how bizarre this conversation is, right? Seems perfectly reasonable to me that the commander's body was destroyed and a new one was created when they brute forced their way back into life.
---
The judge does say no life is in our body and it could be reanimated, but I'm not sure that really spells out that the body wasn't incinerated.
---
lmao this community
---
Amazing
---
Good luck with jumping puzzles XD and Now your clones are bigger and easier to track O\_o
---
&gt; you're out of your mind
---
Nah dude, creating quality artwork takes a lot of time and skill. There are other artists who do commissions for even more than that. 
---
Hell, many Graphic Designers will charge that much for a flat logo. But an actual painting requires understanding of composition, lighting, color theory, anatomy, etc.
---
Pretty sure he's just using the term to blanket coat what he's upset about.
---
 Is there any other way to start the season, really?
---
B-but devs are our friends ;-; I thought I buy their meals when I put money in the gemstore...
---
Give this build a shot: [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Spellbreaker\_-\_DPS\_Spellbreaker](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Spellbreaker_-_DPS_Spellbreaker)
---
The reality is there aren't builds that are both amazing at roaming and also in groups. You really need to figure out which type of play you are wanting to do in a given play sesh and adjust your build to that. I sent the build I did because it is great in groups, but is also fairly strong in small fights and is overall very survivable.
---
If you find yourself without a group, I would recommend you swap your elite for Rampage. Winds of Disenchantment is insane in group combat, but is pretty useless if you're alone. You could also consider changing Break Enchantments for something like Bull's Charge or Endure Pain in roaming scenarios, but break enchantments is strong against any boon reliant build, so it's up to personal preference.
---
For weapons, too, you might want to take a Rifle as an optional swap. Greatsword and Hammer are very strong, but not having a ranged option can be pretty tough in some situations, especially when you're learning. I would swap Hammer for Rifle if you feel like you're unable to do anything because of lack of range.
---
I will also add that this build isn't the easiest thing to play. If you're new to the game mode you may die quite a lot before you learn your limits. Using Winds of Disenchantment at the right moment in team fights also has a learning curve and it's a big deal if you mess it up. If you can get the hang of this build you will love it, though.
---
Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions about any of this.
---
Yes
---
&gt; Well, you do have a workaround. 
---
I fucking love having to do workarounds for QoL features.
---
You're linking builds with integrated graphics . . .
---
Theres no time window for to adress the issue. Arenanet didnt respond, therefore we should continue.
---
By gambling I meant Black Lion Chests.
---
I gave up "keeping it up".  I just uninstalled and moved on to another game.  I've been a lot happier as well.
---
Canach also says they checked repeatedly to make sure you were dead, and I kinda love the image of everyone poking a pile of ash just in case you come around.
---
I played in beta and since launch day. 
---
I still play now, but not enough to be called an active player. 
---
I have bursts of playtime where I'll play for a few weeks nonstop then get burned out again.
---
Just waiting to see what the Devs have planned really, I enjoyed Bound By Blood, so I'm hoping the have a solid plan for where to go and what they're going to focus on. 
---
So many areas have been abandoned over the years.
---
Remember when timers started at the first skill you used? I remember, good times.
---
Get yourself setup on GW2 Efficiency if you haven't. It will allow you to see exactly how much gold you have in assets in your material storage. You generate a lot more gold than you realize just by playing the game and amassing materials.
---
Boycott NCSOFT.
---
They literally thought you were an undead corpse because your corpse got back up again. They talk about checking you while you were dead so they can confirm you were dead.
---
&gt; Theres no time window for to adress the issue 
---
Maybe not but there's a thin line separating tenaciousness and stubbornness.
---
&gt;  Arenanet didnt respond, therefore we should continue. 
---
Good luck with that.
---
No, but he does have the top comment, and he is crying for no reason.
---
Like me, you are the type of player who does not care about slayer/night sigil for each fractal and having 200 potions of each type of creatures, but we know some players do care so, I can understand their anger with the new limitation. :c
---
I don't think this oath was even something meaningful. If there was a real magic mechanism to ensure that you aren't going to invalidate it, there likely won't a whole theatrical performance build around. You would have been just told that there is a kill switch implated into you, gl. No need to impress beyond that.
---
On other hand gw2 story is fairly humancentric, so it is unlikely that we'll ever get anywhere close to breaking that oath.
---
Question, do they have a day/night cycle like the Ascalonian ones or are they always on fire?
---
It's not even the monetisation. It's how they're so out of touch with the hardcore community that the gear templates don't even work for people who switch gear between characters and the account storage cap is pathetically small.
---
Dumb question, but how/where can I start this jumping puzzle ?
---
Sorry, but in all those words you didn't actually say why desert bl or warclaw are not "conducive to wvw gameplay." It's basically just one long whiny youtube comment about daddy anet not listening to the poor widdle wvw players.
---
I've never been able to do this JP.  I hate it so much.
---
I have the same mind set so I get it. The game is definitely designed for you to sell what you collect though. It takes eons to get gold if you never sell anything on the TP. I speak from experience 😉
---
I second this.
---
The words "mod" and "hack" are often interchangeable depending on the narrative you're trying to push.
---
It's essentially a clever macro with a directx hook to display a UI. At worst, it's a tool.
---
Me and 5 others were waiting in the line for a race. Then we heard chainsaw noise. 
---
It was a good time.
---
I have been playing the game since GW1 beta, and online games (in general) even longer.
---
I have seen everything enough to know how lab running commanders and zerglings behave.
---
Your entire summarized story is half true (with a lot of holes and unanswered questions); that much is apparent...but, at least you aren't too afraid to accept that what you did was akin to bullying.
---
It was, and don't call me Shirley.
---
It's not, it's just a way to look controversial to get attention and karma
---
Commanders who command open world PvE exclusively don't have a strong will, nor a backbone - they are very easy to break.
---
The strength of their will is only as strong as the group they are running with, who will join them and support them in their toxicity, as long as what the group is doing benefits the individual.
---
Also, if that is what you got out of what I said (in plain English), then I cannot help your lack of reading comprehension.
---
Hol' up
---
That was so frustrating about that patch. It was some random sideplot in an otherwise great season. It feelt like an asspull and it was obviously immediately going to be discarded and forgotten about.
---
I red this on the toilet while I blue my guts out.
---
The episode was actually pretty decent after the horrible Shining Blade part.
---
The map was nice and has one of the best JPs in the game. 
---
If Anet has half a brain they will never even get close to a situation where this moronic oath could be mentioned at all though. The whole Shining Blade arc was just that bad.
---

Every. Single. Time.
---
GW1 since launch. GW2 since beta weekends. Growing up, Mad King's day and Wintersday were part of the holiday tradition for my brother and I.
---
I took a lengthy break from the series (several years) when HoT launched. The combination of mastery gating and ascended craft gating frustrated me so much I just stopped and didn't pick it back up until after PoF.
---
Guild Wars 1 is actually why I became a game developer. And I very nearly worked for Anet but they couldn't pay me as much as the offer I had in hand from a much larger studio. Honestly, if I didn't have a family to provide for and it didn't require (another) relocation, I would have been happy to take less money to work on the series.
---
IMO Guild Wars is one of the best PC games made and GW2 is the best MMO on the market (I have no tolerance at all for vertical progression or tons of toolbars, or time gating if that wasn't obvious). It might be hard to see sometimes through their missteps, but if you spend any amount of time in other MMO communities then you realize they are all the same. The things people take issue with may be different, but community response to those things is the same everywhere.
---
Ok so you're pissed off that he has some imaginary internet points.. lul

I rather try to fight for what I think is right than just silently accept when Money gets to decide everything.

2 day head start reporting in. I didn’t get a computer good enough to play it until then. Unlike most I never took a sizeable break from the game. I’ve played through every low, at least logging in to run a dungeon or fractals. Only this past year have I started to feel burnt out as my contact list dwindled and all of my closest friends faded away.
---
whoever*
---
Just seeing what a gross depraved community this is.  Guild wars has turned to shit, I've played this game longer than 99% of the people playing it (since gw1 launch) and the community sucks ass now, especially on reddit.  This is why mmos are dying.
---
I enjoyed fighting a Mursaat with Livia.
---
My build is:
---
Trickery 3-2-2. 
---
Critical strikes 2-3-1. 
---
Daredevil 1-2-2. 
---
Heal: withdraw or signet of malice
---
Utilities: roll for initiative, infiltrator signet, signet of agility. 
---
Elite: daggerstorm
---
Weapons are dual pistols + shortbow (accuracy+stamina). 
---
Armor and trinkets are marauder scholar.
---
This build has pretty much infinite dashes, perma switness and perma fury (and has 99.67 crit chance which i boost to 100 with 2x precise infusions). 
---
How to play: 
---
dash/steal/infiltrator arrow ahead of the pack, and spam shortbow 1, while tabbing stuff.
---
Just hitting mobs once will guarantee you get credit even out of squad.
---
For bosses you swap to dual pistol and spam 4 for cc or 3 for dps (which also will give 25 might) You can dodge every single attack and then some; i think you can even solo them easily.
---
If you want a less selfish build just swap your ascended bow for the OP recommendation.
---
NOTE: my marauder gear is from WvW, if you only have a berserker set theres no problem using that!
---
Why even have a leaderboard if there’s no reward for finishing in the top before it resets? Why even have it reset? Why is it on a timer?
---
I've been here since GW1 release as well, and played during GW2 beta events through today. Still going strong.
---
Yeah I feel you on that shit. Thankfully I'm done with that job, and I left a very nasty review of the company on glassdoor. Hopefully all people who glance at that job listing read it and stay the *fuck* away from that nightmare.
---
Your last sentence hits home with me, because my current job I'm at there's a lot of "refugees" from my previous job and pretty much everyone unanimously hated that place. From what I heard it really flopped hard after I left and they had to go through some major changes because their shit finally caught up to them. While I was there I tried so many times to let them know that their new software they paid millions of dollars for was *absolutely atrocious* on the production level and there was no way they'd be able to meet the same output as before with their legacy systems, they didn't take me seriously. Well cya bitches! I'm getting paid an actual decent living wage now and don't have to suffer with 50 hour work weeks anymore.
---
Well shitposted
---
so my armor glitched and it turned out all right
---
Interesting!
---
Every year its the same concerns and they change nothing
---
With 6 x 6yr old toons, I guess I count as a vet. I've taken long breaks in this time and have a 3 yr old, so now the hubby and I can't really play together anymore unless it's after bedtime for the munchkin and that's rare. I don't do much other than log on to do dailies. I managed to get ~30 minutes of the Labyrinthine farm in yesterday while the Hubs fed the munchkin.
---
Time to move your minimap up to the top of your screen. Show off all those nice buffs.
---
I mean, the festivals aren’t really meant to bring new content. Since it’s seasonal and is only around for a short time, we don’t want the devs to put too much of their resources into it. It’s my understanding that this is why almost every MMO only adds a little bit every other year to seasonal events. Only MMO I’m aware of that does something unique each time is Runescape, and considering that game’s specs it doesn’t require as many assets invested into seasonal events.
---
I'll pay for them, but honestly without new elite specs I'm not all that interested in playing outside of the story chapters every few months. The game plays the same as it has for the past two years, and elite specs are the only thing that can fix that
---
Good question. That's why a lot of people were scared that these masteries weren't separate.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

---
haha thanks for the encouragement! I guess I need to review what I'm actually looking to accomplish. (ie: which legendary i'm wroking on) and then get rid of the extras.
---
yeah. I just discovered that. but this gives Anet opportunity to add a second buff bar or a new user friendly design.
---
Nothing wrong with capitalist ferengi players friendo.
---
There's a wind that randomly spawn during the Wintersday JP that if touched will send you back to the last checkpoint. There was a NPC near the fire on the last candy before the stairs of gifts that granted you a checkpoint in case you fucked up or got caugth by the wind. The rate at which the wind generate was eventually lowered so I don't know if the NPC still offer it to you but I think he's still standing there.
---
Why I said it was harder was because the wind could spawn at anytime and anywhere. You were never safe. I once got caugth while falling into the portal/giant gift at the end and was sent to the NPC only to get caugth again by the wind without having time to move and sent back to the begining. A other time I got sent back after walking out of the fire's heat on the starting area . It wasn't the hardest in the game even back then but it sure was in my top list due to this. The Mad King JP on the other hand only have the timer as a challenge so as long as you don't waste time and time your jump correctly you can almost always finish it. There's no monster trying to kill you and the only thing that "spawn" is the path and the hands that come out of the liquid if you're too slow.
---
It’s incredible how low the drop rate is for food, yet it’s so cheap.
---
I guess because it requires PoF. And if it requires PoF, that technically means the masteries and map design can assume that you own mounts, if they're going that route.
---
Here's an uhhhh... opinion that might make a few people mad... or not... Ima tag it as unpopular in case someone disagrees because I want to avoid confrontation
---
This is especially return on the first several days when demand is high and supply is still ramping up.
---
Then buy what you need to open in the last couple days of events.
---
I'm returning to Gw2 after an account I had several years ago was lost to time, and would like some guidance on which class to start with. Are there any recent (post-PoF) guides to the different classes and their playstyles, particularly in PvE? I loved executing combos on my Tempest but I'm open to trying new things.
---
So, this question relates to more of the game than just the event, but Magic Find seems to be a pretty significant discussion topic due to it, so I thought I would ask. Is it worth it to salvage Ectoplasm to gain magic find if you aren't capped? Is there enough in the game that scales off MF to make it worth it? Or should you just worry about magic find when you have nothing better to do. It's something I've heard mixed responses on.
---
Opened 500 so far, got trash and 1 of those flame weapons. Should probably quit while I'm ahead ^(but I wont.)
---
Sadly no, only started with 2. Worth going back?
---
With the exception for the ones needed for achievements.
---
You think downvoting you makes this community gross and depraved? do you not know what those words mean?
---
That means you probably played GW1.
---
Most people just got bossed around by a random bitch that came out of nowhere and had to figure out why their own character would bend over for somebody that honestly had no authority at all.
---
People made fun of Trahearne's story, but this was a million times worse.
---
At least Trahearne wasnt completely ego tripping.
---
Amazing.
---
the log says 6.16s, from the moment i interact with boss encounter (f) to the moment he puts the dialog "so close to freedom ARGHH" xD, both fractal spoon and strider gauge their solos from those parameters so i think we good &lt;3 ty for your reply tho
---
Well actually, back when BGDM had a DPS meter that had gearcheck, people random builds, random gear, and lacking AR (specific to fractals, but still) would join parties.  Anytime I'd raid, we'd get at least three of these people via the LFG and some of them even encouraged to go do the boss right away.  It's why gear pings are a thing today in my squad if someone starts acting suspicious.
---
It's also not too farfetched to say that the common denominator for PvE players are quite garbage.  I've had someone who said their guild couldn't do the Wintersday Raid as it was too difficult, and this same person claims (Unironically too) that the strike mission is still too difficult.
---
Best question ever here. Let's have a try with the infinite blue/green/black/pink/red tonic :-p
---
i made thanos, killed fortnite by accident tho
---
Search WvW on reddit and you will have 5 years of reasons....
---
&gt;  going under the imaginary dps threshold
---
Uh, bro, it's not imaginary if it's for a specific strat people are trying for.
---
This made me sad.
---
Thats fine, but then you would need to do that mad king says stuff. Prefer the tower over that
---
Nice :D
---
Yah its filled with fucking "weekend warriors" and wholesome bullshit.  Its depraved.
---
It's just as selfish to think that just because you are ABLE, and willing, to put a lot of effort, these things should be unobtainable to others.
---
Yeah gonna sell all mine now, opened 400 ToT bags got a  
---
# Polysaturating Reverberating Infusion (Purple) (lucky as hell).  Now its about just selling and then using that money to buy whatever i want/need after the fact.
---
Giorno Giovanna. Jo! Jo!
---
I don't really care about the meta, I've been ultra casual for a long time now. But there's only so much variation between different builds in the same spec in this game. Condi Holo has a pretty similar rotation to Power Holo, same dynamic with Reaper. I'm sure I could mess around with random builds but none of them are particularly fun as they clearly aren't what the specs were designed for.
---
But really, Anet probably won't get any more of my money till those are released. Not really from a spiteful or boycot mentality, it just doesn't feel worth it.
---
RAM is cheap, you should really try to get 16GB
---
Also, the Intel CPU at 4.2 Ghz will shred the Ryzen 5 at 3.6 Ghz (in GW2)  
---
All your threads don't matter for GW2, it's clock and IPC.
---
lol
---
woosh, i was talking about the skyscale mastery
---
r...red?
---
&gt; People dislike DBL and EotM because they are poorly designed. They are poorly designed because the mode was so neglected that Anet forgot how to make maps conducive to WvW gameplay.
---
Here we go I can help.
---
Desert Boarderlands:
---
1. Desert BL (DBL) has a more complex layout compared to Alpine or EBG. There's no real "direct" route to where you want to go most of the time, and this resulted in players getting lost. Just think back to the HoT Maps.
---
2. This resulted in longer travel times. People couldn't get to fights fast enough and towers were flipped even in advanced notice.
---
3. The shrines for each keep created huge advantages. In Earth Keep having all 3 shrines gave the enemy permanent stealth. 2 in Fire Keep would have turrets everywhere keeping you in combat and making movement a slog. 2 in air would activate air turrets which could push enemies off cliffs for instant kills.
---
4. Towers had barricades near them blocking entire pathways. They were mainly used to keep roamers away as groups could just bash them down super easy. Solo and small groups were NOT pleased about this.
---
5. [Skysplitter.] (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Collect_power_cores_and_return_them_to_a_research_camp_to_help_charge_the_Skysplitter) Nuf said.
---
6. Towers and Keeps can't pressure surrounding objectives with treb fire due to distance and for some this made towers feel tactically useless outside of having somewhere to hide.
---
Warclaw
---
1. Remember when it had a 10 target cap and you could stomp 10 people at once? Good times.
---
2. Remember going stealth on mounts and when you were revealed you would rubber band all over the place making you almost impossible to hit?
---
3. Warclaw's speed gave a HUGE advantage over players that did not have the mount which drove away some new players.
---
4. Multiple evades, CC immunity, and speed meant that enemies could run around near zurgs without fear of retaliation as they could just run away. I've had enemy players run along side our groups because THEY knew that WE knew that we couldn't dismount then before they would evade/run away.
---
5. Made it harder for havoc groups to take objectives as the enemy could respond much faster then before.
---
6. Leaping into towers was something that only a few classes could do with specific skills, Warclaw threw that all out and made it much easier for any class to find a way to cheese their way into a tower or keep.
---
7. Turns out being able to instantly kill a downed opponent isn't fun especially in a spike damage meta where you could go from 100% to 0% and stomped in less then a second. Did I mention the mount's immunity to CC?
---
Look I may not have covered everything and Desert BL did have a lot of it's problems fixed (but the stigma stuck with it), but there are problems that needed, and still need to, be ironed out.
---
Are you asking for an UI overhaul to make it decent and modern? We've been asking for years with no answer.
---
You know that you could buy a bigger screen with higher resolution to solve this problem. ;)
---
[deleted]
---
Definitely yeah, other hearts should be around 1-2min each on average i believe, as others said there's also metas and map completion but for gathering currency as fast/efficient as possible definitely heart grinding is faster, though it can get tiring/repetitive
---
kitty!
---
Do they work else where, other than gw2?
---
Enable a UI option that shows all the fixed condi icons stacked on top of all the fixed boon icons, with those icons faded and transparent by default. When you get them, the icon then becomes bold and colored. The remaining icons can be a third row at the tippy top. Id love this, but it should be an option turned off by default for new players.
---
But do you prefer micro-transactions over free, unlimited convenience? Because that’s what this is. Anet monetising on something we’ve had for free for over 2 years.
---
Fucking hell, can you guys not behave for once?
---
Yeah, one of my keybinds (Ctrl + =) stopped working at yesterday's patch.
---
I fixed it by re-binding the action to the same key.
---
Personally, I think that the right side where the mount button is, could use a bit of the overflowing icons as placement.
---
His Majesty, King Thorn: I'm going to kill Joko, and if someone does it before I do, I am going to mutilate them!
---
Commander: \*chuckles\* I'm in danger
---
I’ll gladly not behave, if that’s what you want
---
Last year I tagged up in lab many times, doing all doors. There was always people complaining. 
---
This year I prefer no tag maps to solo farm.  I'm getting more bags then I was ever able to tag(they all die so fast) in a zerg.
---
I've been playing for the majority of this games life, missed a year or two between stints but in all that time I've never seen this issue. I guess one should expect to relog in any case. Lesson learnt.
---
I mean it's not their fault that you grabbed so many buffs.
---
Half /s
---
Nah, that'd be good QoL. Can't have that for build templates.
---
...To find that it isn't dyeble. Sigh.
---
It's quite simple really. Your post did not warrant going into that detail. You spoke about the maps as an example of the playerbase not wanting change. The response to that is quite simply that the playerbase wants change, they just want good change, not bad change.
---
Since you're asking so nicely now, I'll humor you. EotM is a bunch of floating islands interconnected by bridges. Any group that tries to engage another group by crossing the bridge will be at a severe disadvantage. That caused groups to just stand on one island each and wait for the other group to try something. When all those players got bored of that they went back to Alpine/EBG and EotM turned into the karma train map it became famous for, where people avoided fighting each other instead.
---
DBL is not as bad but is plagued by similar problems with a high degree elevation, chokes and things like ravines and bridges or map-specific effects that causes disruptions and inequalities that over time makes people stop trying to play there. So to a higher degree people limit their gameplay to smaller parts of that map and prefer playing other maps where more of the map has more of a levelled playing field.
---
Heh, the whole thing is basically meaningless, especially when you remember that Sylvari are basically a hivemind...
---
Salad Commander? Whoops, now *all* the Sylvari know the Shining Blade's secrets!
---
the only difference between tempest and druid is that tempest doesn't have spirits or spotter, and for the former you can just take a soulbeast, so it's not really that much of an opportunity cost, and lots of builds can easily account for not having spotter. you already see this being done in double renegade (one heal, one for might) comps which are meta on a few bosses already.
---
please stop pretending tempest is significantly worse than druid, it's not. especially now that glyph of empowerment is gone.
---
Why are you screaming at me.
---
It's not actually confirmed to be the Commander's ashes. After all, in the story instance, Dragon's Watch are gathered around the Commander's corpse proclaiming them dead before the Commander levitates in resurrection magic.
---
The story instance itself **heavily** indicates that there was no cremation, otherwise Rytlock and co. would have gone "But you were a pile of ashes!" and not "But you were dead!"
---
&gt;When stockholders see stocks climb they want to push them further, until they implode, and get out befor that happens. 
---
This is absolutely not true. In fact the most successful modern investing strategy is passive buy and hold.
---
No lives matter, all lives splatter.
---
Steve understands this, Its why he uses a chainsaw.
---
Oh we're there already. Fractals continue to drift towards unfun and dead content anyway, you can tell Anet is losing interest and steam in them. At this point I'd have a hell of a lot more respect for Anet if they just said "We're pure casual now. This is the game." instead of pussyfooting around it.
---
It isn’t hard. It’s damn near impossible.
---
WoodenPotatoes(a youtuber)  has also been working on a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxmChRD2epfS9j4gS8D-tdQbPAajODOv&amp;feature=share) of open world builds for story and open map exploration. These builds are aimed at self buffs, survivability and ease of play. Even without his minmaxed gear it's pretty excellent for just getting (re)acquainted with the game.
---
Yes I was. forgot to put that in there
---
That would mean that the oath is bound to your spirit. Now lets say a shining blade dies and goes to the Mists. He could very well spit the Shining Blade secrets to another spirit there since it would technically be useless, cause he is already dead. Livia never died, she only extended her life, but I idk rly. Raising the dead in GW1 is a mystery since I haven't played it yet.
---
&gt; You really don't know what you are talking about right?
---
&gt;
---
&gt; WvW, PvP, Raids, Fractals....
---
None of those would have anything to do with "a huge part of their playerbase" though. I mean, the game could lose everyone who plays any of that content and nobody would really notice. 
---
I'm confused as to what you're talking about when you say "a huge part of its playerbase."
---
&gt;Ofc now there are people claiming that PvE is 90% of population, but well, that wasn't the case before and i assure you if pve was negleced as competitive modes you wouldn't see that many people there.
---
It was always the overhelming majority. Maybe not 90% like it is today, but at least 70% or so. ANet spent less time supporting PvP and WvW because few players were interested in it, not the other way around.
---
"Some cunt will open the damn High Viscount and Lich doors"
---
Haha This made me lol. Are U Aussie?
---
Why don't people like doing the Lich and Viscount btw?
---
Aussie? Nop, didn't hear of that name.
---
My mesmer is dressed as a Necromancer just because I had no idea of what to dress him for this year
---
&gt;Your complaints about DBL amount to people being too dumb to know how to push through a choke or not run off cliffs. That's a learning problem.
---
Basically admitting you have never played wvwvw. Pushing through a choke is a huge tactical disadvantage and has been since necro was in the meta. In alpine knowing when to push and retreat is huge. 
---
The trouble with these maps is that you can't reposition to fair ground like alpine, so the fights never happen. They just get avoided. It was obvious dbl did not make fights happen a week after it was released.
---
Might wanna check in with Anet in that case.
---
BIG yikes.
---
Don't scroll too far. It's a fucking graveyard down there, filled with the friendliest community^^TM
---
Bad bot
---
I don't get it. What's so special in this clip of yours?
---
Their effects aren't very desirable.
---
Dang dude! I love how you drew that skin!
---
The music and lyrics timing specifically with the fall. There’s definitely nothing but another fall without that. 
---
Maybe it’s my own humor but I love when something happens perfectly on cue with something else while not being planned for. In this case, the fall happened right on the “I hate myself” portion of the song lyrics. 👍
---
UUUUUH YEAH!! COUNT ME IN!
---
I see.
---
There are chokes everywhere, for example, keeps. You can't take a keep without passing through a choke. The aggressor just has to go for it sometimes. There are plenty of different paths and levels in the desert that allow for repositioning. It's an imaginary issue.
---
God damn you whine a lot.
---
That's why we allow nonsense threads.
---
Rebuttal: Courtesy, mother fuckers.
---
same here, i only experienced it last year and i even made a thread too lol 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9t85ef/if_the_clock_face_jump_in_mad_kings_clocktower_is/
---
I did this on every map, once a day, on one character. 
---
I used Tekkits Node Routes and that would gain me 30-50 (depending on map) of each currency. 
---
Then I would do the hearts for each map. 
---
Then I would go to dragon stand and buy the currency from the trader. 
---
EVERY DAY 
---
Took about 10 days over 2 weeks of doing this. Yes it’s a lame grind but it’s doable and manageable. Use tekkits routes!!!
---
The race is not that hard, it's been made even easier with some tombstones removed. It's still tricky, especially some corners but very doable.
---
"Extreme time challenge" means just gold time.
---
&gt; Players are leaving.
---
I'll bet you 200g that build templates won't make a dent in the player base. Slowed rate of content, definitely. But build templates pushing out something only a tiny fraction of players actually used? X for doubt.
---
and for only $5
---
Awesome! Thanks for the response! Glad to hear you guys are still around &lt;3
---
Great! That means putting everyone back on equal footing again. Completionists who've built up lots of extra HoT and PoF points should have *something* they can convert them to, though.
---
I have you on my friends list! I've seen your achievement points, you play a lot. Thanks for stopping by. Maybe I'll see ya in Tyria
---
Yeah they are niche, but happen regularly enough they are an annoyance, and when they disappear you don't automatically notice then you play on someone's account without then and it's horrible, all of a sudden you become so grateful for it all
---
&gt; Then don't do it. Just because an achievement exists doesn't mean it needs to be done.
---
Even if you do decide it needs to be done, it'll be back next year, and there's plenty of achievements to keep you busy until then.
---
What was the price of that transition?
---
I would pay for new elite specs. They are arguably THE most important content.
---
Much of the LS5 presentation upset was lack of announcement of specs.
---
Maybe it's best you go back to your shed, boy
---
What would you recommend for a Guardian that has the same exact situation? Whats the best fresh lvl80 gear I can get? 
---
I'm doing this build
---
http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Dragonhunter_-_Radiant_Greatsword
---
and I want to do the tanky variant because I feel too squishy otherwise and want to participate in all PvE content
---
I don't understand at all why they couldn't add a simple dyeable channel to this. Even if it faded from one color into the green, the design itself makes it really desirable... but stuck as that green color, it doesn't fit 99% of my characters.
---
This plus the weird texture they put on the racing scarf to make it shiny and dye weird is extremely vexing.
---
"Pain in the ass to setup"
---
Drag and drop DLL. 
---
Install runtime if the client doesn't work. 
---
Change Area stats settings. 
---
Done, how simple does it have to be for it to not be clunky?
---
"Doesn't work on Mac"
---
As of the new update, Macs can't even run 32 bit applications, not to mention if you're using one, I doubt you actually care about Arc in the first place, you have other priorities. 
---
"One specific niche"
---
Yet it was niche enough to be put into the game and Arcs project was monitored+held back until it came out, it seems like it was a bit more serious than you intend.
---
"In game solution" 
---
Another cherrypicked argument from someone who wants nothing more than to be an annoyance. 
---
&gt;It's not in game yet
---
&gt;Make it yourself
---
&gt;Actually makes it
---
&gt;It's third party I don't trust it
---
Next please.
---
Nice addition to the discussion waste of space number 2.
---
soul pastries used to be used for chrono in raids but idk if it still is, that's the only one i can think of
---
Bit late on the repost there buddy
---
Oh Steve, I've missed you like...
---
Lol, maybe you should migrate to hello kitty island adventure, more your speed for its wholesomeness, wouldn't want words like cuck or mcfaggin to disrupt your delicate sensibility
---
same thing! jumped down, glided, landed, STEVE WAS RIGHT BEHIND THE CORNER
---
OOooooo nice.  As a huge Destiny fan, looking forward to seeing how the story develops.  The recent expansion is turning out pretty good right now.
---
Sounds like you should do some tests
---
Part of the oath process was supposed to call upon deep and powerful emotions as part of the binding... Fighting to the death for a greater cause, our character's social anxieties about the people we're surrounded by, being basically tortured with fire, water and having rocks thrown at us etc... Stuff that could be candidate for being revealed in the Dream.  
---
BUT  
---
The whole thing was hammed up so hard the whole way through that I would not be shocked in the least if they put it out in story that the whole thing was bogus to begin with.  It felt more like a fraternity/sorority hazing-type initiation than something deadly serious.
---
Are you drunk?
---
I had the same disappointment
---
Armor skins that can't even be dyed are so pointless
---
Well, you *did* say "how to make gold" in your title...
---
Yea
---
&gt; ...assumption based on a lack of information.
---
The hilarious thing being that letting people make assumptions on lack of info is almost certainly SOP for a secretive agency like the Blade.
---
&gt;monetization, as i stated, they couln't monetize much from wvw compared to pve
---
* You know, I think this is false. I can't count the amount of wvers who were sporting new gliders quickly after anet introduced gliding to wvw.
---
* Mounts? I sure see a lot of people with mount skins.
---
* Fashion? The number of legendary weapons I see in wvw is nuts too. And lets talk about the number of legendary backpacks made there too.
---
* Server transfers? Yeah, gems.
---
* There's tons of things they could add that I'm sure people would love. Any amount of cosmetic stuff based on rank and kills.
---
They can totally apply their fashion formulas to WvW and make money. What's hurting right now is the core issues that haven't been addressed.
---
Maybe the problem is that they've taken to calling their GMs devs for so long they're confused about the number of developers actually working on WvW.
---
For a game mode in which the fundamental content has changed so little and yet remains popular, it's insane they haven't tried to make it more successful.
---
Look in LFG for meta trains. Usually they’re between 6:30 pst - 9:30 pst if you have time. You can hop in and out any time. Guarantees you to get the metas done.
---
Imagine losing to a 'god' who you can auto attack 111 to death.
---
Nah im afraid id run into you if i started playing that game
