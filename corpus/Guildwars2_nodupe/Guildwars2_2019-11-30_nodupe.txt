So you don't have 30 unspent points in your training panel?
---
---
---
it's that case with all raid 10-man squads. someone was probably in combat from hitting the essence mastery pillar.
---
Yes, its "collecting materials" except it requires an overwhelmingly obscene ammount of materials from all over. 
---

---
The kind of grind required for a legendary would make it literally impossible for you to have 5 if your time is so limited it takes you 4 months to finish open world.
---
They really needed to keep publishing novels for the franchise.
---
love her!!
---
What was Mike O'Brien thinking, walking away from this studio?
---
Sent a report a week ago about this at exploits@arena.net. Arenanet decided to remove the kick ONLY from the strike mission in bjora marches. : )
---
This makes no sense at all, especially saying 
---
&gt; but that's pvp focused
---
PvP was *the* thing during prohecies and factions.
---
Have you done them before? You don't get additional points for repeating them, just the loot.
---
We're gonna need a bigger booth...
---
I've been able to keybind virtually everything without relying on modifiers or mouse buttons:
---
Movement related keys:
---
* Moving = QWE + S for backpedal
---
* Dodge = X (press with thumb)
---
Combat abilities:
---
* Abilities above weapon set = D, Tab, F2, F3, 5
---
* Swap weapon + Weapon abilities = Caps Lock + 1234R
---
* Heal + Utilities + Ultimate = Z + ACV + F (press CV with thumb)
---
Misc keys:
---
* Interact = T
---
* AoE loot = G
---
* Additional ability that pops up throughout PoF = H
---
* Tab target = ` (key left to 1)
---
* GW2Radial mount bind = Alt
---
* About Face = CTRL 
---
I think these are the most crucial abilities, minus AoE loot which would free up G as a bind (I might rebind G to "additional ability that pops up throughout PoF, instead of H).
---
My mouse only has 2 side buttons and 1 DPI button and holds some of the more niche functions:
---
* Side button 1 = Stow weapon
---
* Side button 2 = Clear target
---
* DPI button = mount (despite using GW2Radial for mounts, I like using that button for my favorite mount and as a universal dismount button)
---
* Mouse Wheel Click = put that red circle above someone's head which I use Shift for to take as target.
---
Btw I changed my Caps Lock key to function as CTRL and my left CTRL to function as Caps Lock so I don't constantly turn Caps Lock on and off while swapping weapon. About Facing for that reason kinda sucks with that bind but I don't really have any other keys left for it :P
---
He and a bunch of other developers wanted to work on other projects. NCsoft said no.
---
I don't know who the crabby old bastard that stated it was, but he made a good point: Mike O'Brien missed the biggest opportunity in MMO history when he let the excellent GW2 combat system go to waste in the half-assed game mode that is WvW.
---
"dead game"
---
(chuckles) i'm in danger
---
Why is this tagged NSFW?
---
GW2 is such a *mediocre* (that's me being nice) single player game, too. You want a quality single player experience, play Witcher or Doom or RDR or Last of Us or Mario or Zelda and I can go on and on. GW2's multiplayer-oriented features like WvW, raids, guilds, etc. are what make it worth playing. If I want to player single player games there are many out there that are so much better than what GW2 can ever hope to muster, that the fact the devs insist on spending as much time on single-player story as they do is bewildering to me. I do try to play through it 5-man like instanced content but it doesn't really work. It's still non-gratifying and still largely just listening to cringe-tier dialogue or facerolling through monsters. I'd gladly take 100% less "living story/saga/whatever" (by the way there's nothing "living" about it anymore, either, it's entirely static and does nothing to affect the persistent game world the way season 1, the only real "living" story season, did) in exchange for a bit more support of the multiplayer aspects of the game.
---
Yep check.. that's why i did the third one, just to be sure
---
Still the same points.. didn't try another one tho
---
It has so much potential and the idiots who got bored making it are the ones responsible for it not topping the charts today! This game could easily be the mmo that changes gaming but it was lead by short sighted management and bled dry long before it's time. 
---
All it needs is someone at NCSoft who recognizes it's full potential to pump up the investment rebuild a solid team and crank out some amazing content. New WvW battlegrounds, new PvE maps with HoT repeatability and new raids, dungeons and throw a 100k at a real PvP tournament and this turns around!
---
I started to play a few months ago so I have only one good character now. Can you give some tips in this situation to make it in optimal way?
---
What about reducing the duration or potency of the effect by the number of fields that you proc? For example, half heal and might on a fire+water simultaneous blast? Might work.
---
What is the optimal way to farm it if I have one char? I mean I will do ice farm a bit but I'm asking about right way to farm each map. Events and hearts?
---
It is ONE of the supposed end-games but Anet destroyed all 3 of their "could have" modes.
---
WvW and PvP neglected, with random minor useless patches that should have been in the game from the start.
---
PvE "end-game" was supported for the longest time, from Fotm to Raids and now I guess Strike missions but mostly are a joke with minor exceptions (personally love Dhuum and Matthias). But I have no doubt in my mind they will soon all be forgotten as all previous pve endgame content. 
---
While "Saga" and Thursday's library kid stories reading time's only difference is the kids at the library get to hear a story each Thursday unlike GW2 players every 4 months.
---
Events, hearts, the meta event on each map, gathering the nodes on each map and map completion on that one character will give you some too.
---
Bonus: it immediately turns invulnerable and slinks away half across the map because it decided it was "out of its comfort zone" (but not out enough to not aggro or not attack). Anet logic...
---
Because at first sight you think you can see some norn pipi but it turns out to be overexposed highlights making the area blinding white to distract you from the fact that he's still wearing shorts.
---
Didn't the writing team gloat in an interview about giving Bangar a believable motive for joining Jormag?
---
Something like "the commander has a dragon and, since Bangar is a warrior, he will see it as a threat". 
---
This is the writing team that boasted about recycling the same "introduce an NPC and kill them after two episodes" trope since 2012 and that released an interview about the impact of character death only to revive Aurene right after. I wouldn't bet on them to be able to write in a compelling way.
---
Sorry man, but this isn't Mass Effect. The devs are unlikely to want to have to plot future releases around half of the playerbase sparing Ruinbringer.
---
For what it's worth, he's likely already being corrupted by Jormag. I don't expect we'll have much choice but to fight him. Those Icebrood Charr were very prominent in the trailer.
---
Bangar is essentially furry Hitler, so there is zero chance of him being redeemed.
---
The biggest annoyance of action camera thieves is "missing" teleports.
---
That makes me nuts.
---
Really not at all.
---
Had that in the second last arah Mission. Someone in the forums said I should lower the graphics. I did and could finish the mission.
---
I think, if done correctly, this could give necro a very fast paced spec. If cooldowns, skill effects, and such are balanced in the right way, this spec could be very fluid and move very quickly between shroud and such.
---
Also, it would be interesting to see a really good long ranged option, however people tend to forget that base necro is still valid, and base necro shroud is quite long ranged.
---
So basically ANet's writing team is so incompetent it makes Furry Hitler sympathetic to the point people don't want to kill him.
---
Then again, Trahearne was their idea of a likable character...
---
&gt; Contrary to what you seem to believe, there are more than enough people interested in the core WvW experience to sustain the game mode. 
---
If there were enough people interested in the core WvW experience to sustain the game mode then ANet would be sustaining the game mode. 
---
There are not. 
---
&gt;If people don't want to PvP, a mount won't change that.
---
I agree, but it was a reasonable gamble. If ANet couldn't convince new people to join in, then it wouldn't be worth continuing development on the mode.
---
ANet couldn't convince new people to join in.
---
&gt;It's like if they decided to make the next LS zone a PvP area. PvE players would be pissed, because they don't want to PvP. WvW players wouldn't care, because it's an LS map.
---
right, but they wouldn't do this because there are a LOT more happy PvE players, and ANet wouldn't want to piss them off by making a change that would not improve the game for them. 
---
Now, *if* the game were in a state in which 80%+ of the players were WvWers and they wanted to get some of them to try the PvE modes, then making the next LS zone a PvP area would not be a bad idea. It still might not work, but it would at least be trying something. 
---
&gt;Give your audiences what they want, don't try to make them do something they aren't interested in doing.
---
They do, it's called "open world PvE." **All** the recent tantrums on /r/Guildwars2 have been about players upset at them for doing this.
---
Yeah... a lot of wasted potential. The combat system is slick and polished. tonnes of character customisation. Great music. Great art. Even the class balance is pretty good by MMO standards.
---
They really should have gone ham with open world meta, raids, and WvW. And the end of the day what sets an MMO apart is it's scale, and the communities. Focusing down on solo play living story instances is the wort possible decision for long term sustainability in an MMO.
---
Instant upvoted and sent thru all messenger friends
---
Guild Wars 2 was on point, but they really started to bork it up. Especially with their cash shop, as well as the aesthetic of player equipment.
---
I certainly miss the early days of Guild Wars 2 WvW, that was my jam.
---
I no longer play, but I do certain things from time to time.
---
Spoiler: We will kill Bangar.
---
Bangar is kinda like this games version of Scar, sure we can give him a chance but is he willing to accept that chance we also need to show him that what he perceives is wrong.
---
However I do not know if Anet might go to that depth or if he is worth even saving up to this point. He is tempted by power and power corrupts pretty fast when dealing with an elder dragon. At best I see us saving Rytlock's son and killing Bangar (mostly because he became icebrood).
---
IMO its very subjective after all. And don't get me wrong. Im one of those persons which loves GW2 combat design. But when I try to look at it very objectively then I actually can't agree. I'll tell more. I didnt like GW2 design at the beginning that much tbh. It came with time. I prefered other designs in the past. Because I spend a lot of time in other very good designed games. We just like what is familiar for us. We like what we know. When we play something for a long time then we start to like its design more and more. With time it raises. That's why theres still a lot of players which plays oldschool MMORPG's and they don't mind to change. And same will be with GW2. If someone won't be determined enoght, then this person won't move on from here. It will be last MMO for a lot of players. It's very hard  to change it to something else because everything else looks worse. It requires time. Game design isn't that important after all. Players can get used to everything. Some player will be in love with 2D graphics and will literally hate any 3D (I know this kind of people. And they still play Helbreath for example. Since 2005. Because they love its design and GW2 is shit for them). Others even can't imagine playng something with different design than WoW (I know this kind of players too. They tried GW2 and didn't like its design at all).  And some one else will pick GW2 and won't be able to play something else.
---
This is safe for work
---
So we are the Dreamcast. Lovely.
---
&gt; Well, aren't they still executing their plans but just slightly slower?
---
You have to look at the bigger picture. They were already on Living World Maintenance Mode, this is not legacy code.
---
Look at literally every other part of the game that isn't LW and you'll see it's very, very neglected. Just because they can focus on a small part of their game that was already updated compared to the rest of it, doesn't mean it didn't hurt them immensely.
---
&gt; As time goes on and the teams refocus on GW2
---
Sorry but that's not what is happening. You know NCSoft West recently got a huge sum of money to pump into ArenaNet? You know Arenanet are hiring for console developers? As much as I want to agree with you, they are not putting a lot of resources into GW2. 
---
&gt; We need Season 5 to build up to the next expansion
---
Lol, there will be no expansion after Season 5. I'm inclined to call you out on your bullshit if you genuinely think that they can push out an expansion in what, 15 months? Sorry but how long have you been following this game and company? They had zero plans for an expansion before season 5. They likely still don't have any plans for one.
---
&gt; With that said, I really hope that the player will be able to choose to be on his side. 
---
Get that Sylvanas-style garbage out of Gw2.
---
Try to hit two maps maybe three per day.  Knock out hearts.  Rift events can give up to 30 per day per character.   Don't overlook dailies.  The biggest pain in the butt map was the one with the charr for diflourite. The easiest was either the domain of Kourna as you can do the meta multiple times for extra currency, or Istan since each heart vendor gives 25 of the currency. Dragonfall has "free" map currencies,  and the new map can let you convert karma into currencies.
---
Path of Exile. It's considered the closest game to GW1 in style and look how freaking awesome it is getting all the love and attention it does.
---
POE is an arpg. It's not at all like Gw2
---
It's a shame that amazing combat systems like GW2 and Tera were wasted on games where the decision makers were incredibly short sighted and greedy.
---
Dont worry, i mean even if the game is in a perilous state it's not my ass on the line. Anet will have to figure their shit out.  And no if you read this discussion it's rather civilized and not a flame war.
---
Nothing will ever replicate speed clears in gw1. What a miraculous accident
---
If you're on a US server, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I can help you through both instances.

[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zhaitan%27s\_Rest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zhaitan%27s_Rest)
---
They even had a map in the beta, it seems more like they removed it themselves, likely because they changed Zhaitan's model from the art we saw in the game's teaser \[that showed him more armored rather\] to the amalgamation of dragon corpses he currently is.
---
With my [Logitech G402 Mouse](https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/gaming-mice/g402-hyperion-fury-fps-gaming-mouse.html), my setup for combat is:
---
* Double Tap movement key to dodge
---
* Q = Healing
---
* E = 1st Utility
---
* Upper Side Mouse Button = 2nd Utility
---
* Lower Side Mouse Button = 3rd Utility
---
* Middle Mouse Button = Elite
---
* Ctrl+1 (to 4) = Shatter Skills
---
Your assumption is based on anet management being competent, always making the correct decisions for their game, and actually being in touch with the player base. We know this is not the case- it's been shown time and time again. Source: layoffs, unhappy playerbase, employee turnover, NCSoft stepping in to restructure things, etc
---
Additionally, the fact that so many people are upset about only getting LS content just proves that that content *isn't* what they want, because if it was, they wouldn't be complaining. Don't get me wrong, there are many players who do want that sort of content (I assume you count yourself in that group). Maybe even the majority of currently active players. But what Anet doesn't realize is they're only the majority because everyone else stopped playing and went to other games, since the only content being developed is something they don't care about at all. It's a fallacious line of thinking that is severely limiting this game's reach and success- they've pidgeonholed themselves into appealing to a very niche audience that doesn't have much room for growth, while there are tons of folks looking for a good MMO with solid endgame content, high level dungeons, and *especially* quality RvR. I mean, just look at the hype surrounding games like Camelot Unchained, WoW classic, and AAU.
---
GW2 has the potential to be that game, if Anet wasn't hyperfocused on one niche that in my opinion is better suited to singleplayer RPGs.
---
Yes but the trait system in PoE matches the GW1 skill system, where there are tons of builds but you have to make it work.
---
Ehhh everything in this game, at least story-wise is 100% soloable. Kralkatorrik and Balthazar fights were mostly braindead content xD. There is only one exception to this and that's migraine.  Balthazar was supposed to be a great fight until they decided to give you Sohothin that just does a fuckton of damage just by pressing 1. Kralk was a bit better. Im not sure hoping for the same thing to continue is good, making fights boring is usually not a good thing.
---
&gt;I absolutely love the lighting effects in the Aberrant Forest.
---
Is that why you also admit you heavily edited it?
---
I think we could lose rytlock or Crecia in this episode. In particular it feels like this chapter is closing out Rytlock's story. He wants to bring his son back from the brink and regrets not being in his life. He wants to surpass Bangar and he wants to make amends with Crecia. Crecia, on the other hand, was in their son's life and equally will feel she's a failure as a parent and leader. She is also loyal to Hang at and could make a sacrifice to try to rescue him or her son. They are well contrasted against each other in this episode and when we consider Braham's place in this - chasing after the bow, his only keepsake of his dead mother whom he was unable to fully reconcile with, and the ghosts of his guild he feels he abandoned, we can see that the writers are going to juxtapose his story of family and dishonor/disloyalty with Rytlock. I'm hoping they use Braham as a catalyst for Rytlock to have a happy ending - that is that he gets a chance to be with his son as a lesson learned from Braham losing his mother. If this is the case then I can see Crecia getting the axe before the saga is over.
---
&gt;Something like "the commander has a dragon and, since Bangar is a warrior, he will see it as a threat".
---
This just strikes me as the younger sibling throwing a tantrum because the older sibling has something that they don't have.
---
Fair point. I'm going to guess none of the 3 liked being under NCSoft's boot, but Mo was the one who just dealt with it. If I were told that I need to fire a quarter of my workforce, who I really care about, then I would also consider moving elsewhere. I don't think it's coincidence that it's been a solid 2 years on constant drama. Did he always handle things right? Of course not. I just can't imagine being given that ultimatum and then ever consider looking these people in the face day after day knowing they could very well demand you do it again.
---
I'm sure I'm thinking too much into it, but I don't think it's as simple as "he doesn't care anymore".
---
Should be fixed when the Tuesday patch hits.
---
If WvW was actually interesting to me this would be godlike without any challenge. But ball of clowns vs ball of clowns is just not interesting, and an MMORPG without interesting mass PvP just feels weird. I've played absolutely terrible MMORPGs over GW2, like literaly dogshjt games, but their mass PvP was fun.
---
Rip my only weekend with time to play the game :(   but thanks for the info
---
complaining about easy content... why not practice your class and try again instead of whining on a reddit where ppl are just gonna take a shit on u.
---
I wasn't whining or complaining.
---
&gt; It's neither hard nor controversial.
---
Fuck that nonsense. It's a loaded question designed to stir up a hornet's nest.
---
Because anyone with a different opinion or perspective is wrong.
---
If you keep disco dancing The Bee Gees will come back into style, donchyuknow?
---
I make mine very simple:

weapon skills: 1-5 (default
---
heal/utility/elite skills: shift + 1-5
---
special action key: g
---
While it might sound that way to you, it doesn't necessarily follow.
---
I've made several complex plans in my business without deciding a specific additional thing. You can have a plan for six new masteries while leaving an earlier mastery open for further expansion later.
---
Writers do this all the time in books. I don't suspect games are much different.  We don't have plans to expand this now, but we might decide to return to it in the future.
---
u/notenoughdaydrinking
---
&gt; Fuck that nonsense. It's a loaded question designed to stir up a hornet's nest.
---
*Snort*
---
Uh huh, sure.
---
I actually have a spine so I'm gonna call bs on that. We can agree to disagree so whatever.
---
Since Anet loves their tropes and Bangar is *The Old Warrior Who Refuses to Stop Fighting and Seeks a Warrior's Death* he's dead meat even if he does realize he has lead his supporters to ruin.
---
If my bro Rytlock dies I'm going to be saltier than a competitive player on Reddit.
---
Asura don't get stunned. They get distracted contemplating the Eternal Alchemy.
---
We could use this on thin slabs of meat for all the cubs, yes?
---
Hemahem... Block button is a good button.
---
Damn dude you scared me lol. Made a new account and tried the code. Both expansions got activated xD.
---
Nah. I mean that his role was the purification of Orr, he achieved that, killed Zaithan, so at that point, he had no use other than being 'commander of the pact'. Then the plot moved to Mordremoth and the Sylvari, he had no role to play in it, and was just killed at the end.
---
'He sacrificed himself at the end to kill Mordremoth.' 
---
Eh. The writers could have easily said that by killing Mordremoth in the dream realm, everything was goochy, but since Traherne had no use, he was just an extra body count for the story to have more impact. Traherne being there or not had no impact on the story.
---
Part 1:Tom Abernethy pacing and structure is least of your problems,and it is clearly something you don't know how to do.Far bigger is the unlogical writing with things like:BROham MommyIssues being blamed for not knowing that the dragon will fall asleep and all the BROnorn with him for no reason deciding to not chase the running away dragon.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Part 2:JuliaNardinSelfInsert Jhavi ReeSoesbeeSelfInsertdottir and !General! Almorra Soulkeeper which happen to be professional SOLDIERS couldn't jump a small cliff a child can.The two antagonist norn walking to a nearby cave for around 6 hours,which the main character reaches in few minutes,instead of running away from the zone in that time.And if you bring the ice storm,that means that Jormag jeopardized his own people while doing a mission he send them on.
---
Part 3:BROham MommyIssues in an earlier seen says that he has never seen a Sons of Svanir attack anyone,even though everyone knows by this point that the Sons of Svanir attack people,only for a later seen to say that the Sons of Svanir attacked him and his guild mates while they were hunting the dragon.Not to mention that Jormag says he wants to help,but still continues to send his minions to attack and kill people.But the funniest must be the that the antagonist norn and the two professional SOLDIERS made Wheel tracks while walking on their two feet.

You're required to listen but not to talk as people will explain things via discord voice
---
It's still risky - because the chargeback for codes (in the case of a fraudulent key) can happen much later, but would still impact any account that used the code(s).
---
Veteran players frequently complain there's nothing to do because despite the fact we all know there's loads to do, they are understandably bored of doing all those things again and again. Why can't MO feel the same way? He might well be sick of it, even. 19 years of ArenaNet means 20+ years of Tyria in his head. When you think of it like that, it makes sense that he would want a change, regardless of anything else going on.
---
I don’t really get why people who exclusively play PvP based game modes don’t just play those kinds of games. The reason a majority of the player base plays mostly PvE content is because they’re there to play an MMO. PvP is a nice side activity that they’ll probably engage in once in a while, but it’s not really the main focus of most players and it’s not the main focus of the devs either.
---
Like I enjoy first person shooters, but when I played Destiny (the first one), I didn’t spend all my time in the crucible and then complain that there wasn’t enough focus on PvP, because when I played Destiny, I was there primarily to do raids with friends, farm for materials and gear, play through the story, etc. Crucible was just a fun side activity that I focused on more some days than others.
---
When I wanted to play a strictly competitive shooter back in those days, I’d get on Call of Duty for a few matches, and when overwatch came out, I played that a bit too. They were games built almost strictly with competition in mind. There’s no “greater world” for them to focus on, there isn’t all this other content they’re allocating their dev team to. It’s all just PvP all the time.
---
Tipping a porting Mesmer.
---
I don't think you can cheese this one because it requires checkpoints. If you have the difluorite crystals to spare, I recommend buying the Position Rewinder in Sandswept Isles.
---
Its ahead of its time, but they squander is potential and abandon so much of the game that it doesn't matter. It can be well crafted, well designed and ahead of its time but if the people crafting it don't make it or try to make it have the best of what it can offer it will be a sub-par product. WvW and PvP were why the combat was designed as it was, do you honestly believe they would of made the game as it is now for PvE? Hell no. Not on the combat end. It would probably play more like a regular mmo-rpg and not have the face paced rewarding combat it has.  
---
They abandoned it, like dungeons, like fractals and probably soon to be raids. Now we have living world story episodes which piss on the original game and its lore and then to top it all off we get strikes. So they keep abandoning core features of the game with no compensation, guilds and guild halls don't get any new additions and we aren't even getting new specs (Should be getting new classes and races) to be fair its an AMAZING GAME. And I love it. But Its potential is left to rot by people who don't understand or know their game as well as their community.
---
Aside from being a shitty manager? Who knows!
---
I did it by Going for the top first, then second, gliding down as I go and the first check point... Worked fine.
---
It's easily possible to cheese Not So Secret with skyscale within less than 30s with practice. 
---
(I spent over 2 hours figuring it out) xD
---
It's a constant issues that never seems to be solved. Anet has abandoned PvP IMO. I've had the same bots 3 days in a row even after reporting them right away. And far worse has happened to me with riggers and bots. Never seeming to be banned. Some even think the bots are Anet trying to fill qs.
---
How about the Griffonhook Run jp?
---
Having trouble with that one. Needed it for 1step for chuka champawat bow
---
I honestly believe he was told to leave, or he would be fired.. They offered him the golden parachute .
---
They honestly just need to remove loot from matches unless you get at least one top stat, or perhaps only loot on kill participation.
---
Mods probably read it as 
---
rytlock bangs crecia.
---
Or... Anet should just ban the obvious bots... rather than ruining rewards for actual players
---
quite a few cave jps with no mount zones can still be mount cheesed. find a way to break out of map, mount around the edges of the map and drop down into the jp end zone from above
---
I don't know mate...it sounds like a slippery slope. I"ll see myself out now.
---
I solo HOT all the time. NOt every hero point but there are certainly enough people around to get most of that stuff done. Learning the maps takes time and getting the masteries helps. 
---
HoT was made better for casual players by changing a couple of champs to vets and adding veteran events that are fairly easy. They also thinned out mobs in a few areas.
---
But it was never really that bad if you knew your class and took time to learn the enemies. Obviously the maps being more convoluted means they took more time to learn, but it was meant to be end game expansion content.
---
If you're on a US server, I show a lot of people around HoT and teach them how to deal with the zones. Hit me up on Vayne.8563 if you want some help.
---
I should mention this tuesday I'm away for a week, so it would be either before or after.
---
...have you played the story? This all already happened...
---
It was a joke, but thinking that HoT sucks is more of a you personally problem, than an Anet problem. 
---
HoT was hard at the start because suddenly mobs were hitting like trains and people had to learn mechanics and also to read the information in an enemies HP bar and this whole thing about breakbars and CC being useful in coordinated spikes, but those days are over due to power creep and the average player's familiarity with the four year old content.
---
Subarashi!
---
Skill system of GW2 is relativly weak, same as trait system and the overcomplicated equipment system. But those are only aspects of combat, the whole combat (including movement/dodging) is very fluent and indeed a strength of GW2.
---
Fields are actually contrary to the movement focused gameplay. 
---
You don't want to make use of movement to kite enemies etc. Stack in one spot, AOE everything to death. That's a weak aspect. There is also no need to choose strategical a target - you AOE everything to death, there is no point in going for ele/healer/whatever first. Same for teambuffs: you don't have to choose, it's dumbed down to aoe effects - boons/heals for everyone.
---
Many games 10-20 years ago were superior in these aspects. But integrating a skill system into a FSP/platformer type of movement system is indeed very well made in GW2. There are only a few single player games as ratchet and clank which did comparable good.
---
Honestly, how do you and others deny that the game is seeing massive neglect in all aspects EXCEPT the gemstore. Even the current LS is looking a bit barren. It was fun but it was far shorter than the prologue which Anet had claimed was not nearly as meaty as the episodes. If the first one is a fluke then sure okay but that still only brings players back every few months for a few weeks. 
---
Every mode and content and even balance across the board has come to a slow crawl.
---
It’s one thing to lose people and keep on keeping on. It’s another to lose 140+ employees in one swoop, followed by 3-5 every so often from there on out.
---
The fractal team which got merged to raid/fractals, lost 2/4 people. So now it’s potentially a team of 2. Things like that really don’t bode well for the pace and quantity/quality of the content to come. I can only imagine what the other teams look like. 
---
The only thing the players know is that they have season 5 of the LS, that Swiss/Alliances are on the table, and finally some wvw/PvP balance is on the way.
---
And in between that they see key people leaving the company. So, how do you pretend none of that is going on? How do you even begin to compare that to your job where you have systems in place that losing people isn’t as big of a deal. Where management isn’t running the company into the ground. And finally where you are putting money first even if it comes at the expense of your customer’s satisfaction?
---
Why is everyone that disagrees with you labeled a troll?
---
Nice to see some things never change, Like MMO epeeners.
---
Wrong thread much?
---
No one truly quits this game.
---
It's not about epeeners, it's about you misjudging where the problem lies.
---
Complaining about people that post salty complaints on Reddit because they were let down by their most favorite game and its dev - in a salty post on Reddit. 
---
Lol.
---
Just make it so you take damage if you stay in the "safe" area for too long.
---
They've gotten rid of one or two especially stupid skills(literally) but not much else has changed in terms of difficulty.
---
People with the spirit of the original GW leaving is not okay. Of course the company will be fine. But what's happening to the core idea of GW is what scares me
---
[Wiki says](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Waypoint_Unlock_Box): "Ascalonian Grassland Waypoint Unlock" has 104 and "Shiverpeak Mountains Waypoint Unlock" has 106 so one of those
---
People have been cheesing Not So Secret with Springer for years, it's not like you need to keep any Skyscale routes to yourself.  Well, unless you want to be a dick about it.
---
Really just number of waypoints, pick whichever.
---
👀
---
Yes yes, you're very uber, everyone is impressed.
---
ZZZzzz...
---
I've seen people mention that there was a mob that spawned inside the floor/wall somewhere. You could give that a try with a flamethrower either on an engineer or one of flamethrower consumables.
---
Sure. Post it out and let Anet patch'em all. Not a dick move.
---
We tried that already with half a raid and cleard every mob in about a mile
---
Yeah the groundwork and combat in GW2 is superior. What severely cripples its success are the stupid decisions and the horrible balance.
---
[removed]
---
The springer+griffon cheese is still working last time I checked (last week).

---
Funny thing is that Anet is reading Reddit quite often, cause they respond when they see a topic they like. As for the several hundred posts about bots and PvP they just ignore it for some reason.
---
As an artist and a wife of one I don't agree with the comparison of consumer and creator. A creator loves their work and do it cause they enjoy doing it. A consumer just shows up, buys a ticket, painting, subscription, book whatever and moves on to the next cool thing when done. Or doesn't even buy anything cause they didn't like it or though there's something better because they don't get to experience and do what the creator did. Gw2 is his baby, but to keep working on such a huge thing you do need breaks otherwise you'll block. If anything I'm much more inclined to think it's not being bored with gw2 but being denied creative freedom and side projects and having to fire your long term friends and colleagues who know how to work with you.
---
No he wasn’t, because he led to this mess. No sane person would waste such project as GW2. Maybe if he had stopped caring somewhere after HoT.
---
Is this how your game looks all the time or did you do some post processing o the screenshot? Because it looks amazing and I’d love to know how to replicate that!
---
Happy cake day :D
---
I hate her so much. Why won't she die!! We lost so many during our fight and that noisy little asura just keeps escaping death! Why?!
---
Logan... Did that guy ever took a good decision ?
---
look for a guild to run with.  it's more consistent than servers.  what time zone do you play? (based on server time?)  check that in [wvwstats.com](https://wvwstats.com) and chose the best or 2nd best server for ppl to play with. :3

:3 upvoted for being a smart person.

'cause she's our Waifu

Only on certain maps you can break the pathing sure.

The real issue is the pve pip farmers who play afk.
---
That’s why I don’t play ranked randomway and only play AT/mAT format.
---
Faren. The humor just doesn't click with me
---
Don’t play ranked pve pip farm.... it’s full of pve who afk and gold farmer who bots multi box.
---
Real gw2 pvp is only at AT/mAT
---
I liked groundhog day when it was a movie
---
Since I literally only mentioned how whining about whiners isn't ironic, I really didn't touch the goalpost at all. Now you're obviously well within your right to demand a deeper dive into the issue, which I'm not actually interested in. However I might be convinced to do so, but are you actually willing to stop falsely equating "the whinyest members of the community spewing whatever caustic garbage makes them feel better" with "people who have legitimate concerns and complaints"? That would need to be the first step, and I'm pretty sure your entire argument is build around that fallacy.
---
Damn it I’m also doing Aurora but having gotten to the JP part yet... 
---
Really gonna hate this part since I mostly play PvP/WvW so I sucks really really bad at JP
---
Caithe. Just. Caithe self righteous and omfg unhelpful af
---
I think the major reason why this feels a lot more impactful is because it's in a very quick succession, like dominos. That is what gives the impression of gloom &amp; doom right now. There are no real good news and all we're seeing as outsiders looking in is a lot of people quitting, including very key people to projects that are both old and brand new. 
---
People's attitudes would be different (although I think it still would be generally negative) if we saw an influx of hires amidst the departures.
---
The two I actually hate most are Dessa and Scholar Glenna. I don't necessarily despise their characters, but they feel more like a placeholder for another more richly realized character.
---
Particularly in the last raid, it's odd for scholar Glenna to be present and actively engaging in the raid when she is supposed to be a normal priory scholar. Her role would be much more appropriately taken by Qadim or someone local to Elona.
---
The same is true for Dessa. These fragments of the past are incredible and hearing her screechy voice over them ruins the atmosphere.
---
Wasted potential, it could have dominated the market if it wasn't for horrible management.
---
Braham.
---
Hey, someone else! I bet there are dozens of us! 'Hate' is of course far too strong a word for it, but I really...I don't know. Something about her just strikes me the wrong way. I fangirled all over her way back at S1 when they showed her the first time, a film noir detective?! Hell yes!
---
And now...she just is there. The token lesbian. Even Kasmeer has more personality.
---
Maybe Anet tried to get that dark, silent, mysterious type working with her and all she turned out as was being nothing. Now they threw that dead family member trauma at her, so now she at least has a presence.
---
"As a Seraph captain, I can't really jump around saying, "Pick me! Pick me!" But I can certainly think it."
---
The whole collection is dumb and boring waste of time and should be scrapped and replaced with proper quest to get skyscale imho.
---
I agree, WvW has huge potential if they'd just throw it a bone every now and again. I'd probably even consider returning to the game if they gave it a meaningful update, including balance.
---
Ah that was all the way back before living story. Then he died and was never mentioned again.
---
Anet better not to touch game industry at all at this point. Because every single thing they developed aside gemstore is abandoned, bugged, neglected, lied or unpaid passion project.
---
Or it could be better. Or the same.
---
Almost every single PvP game 6 month ago had a bot or two. Most likely there is more of them these days. If you do not know it you are just bad. WvW do not have bots, because they farm gold in PvP.
---
Marjory and Kasmeer bore me to tears.  
---
Other than that, I use to hate Taimi but her writing improved, and she doesn't have all dat plot armor anymore. However, I could complain about the fact that arguably the most intelligent asura we know is a child but hey, the Guild Wars franchise was never really known for its realism.
---
xd i did each story once and i wouldn't even go to maps if i didnt need the currencies XD
---
Climping the durmand priory with the skyscale and then flying all the way to the jumping puzzle, the no mount zone has a height limit ;)
---
I believe the whole reason for Blish's existence was so that Taimi would consider the possibility of transferring her consciousness into a golem. I would actually be surprised if Anet did not take it down that road and maybe just killed her off with no chance of returning.
---
without further context this sounds very much like user error. best guess you either unlocked them through wvw or simply too long ago to remember, and aren't familiar with the different icons that represent that fact.
---
It's probably blocking the other one from starting, it's pretty rare that events will spawn when another one is in the immediate area.

---
Actually, what few MMOs we have in their betas and in development look pretty shit. Ashes looks like a dumpster fire, Pantheon hurts my eyes whenever I see someone play it, Chronicles of Elyria is just a no-no, etc.
---
I don't think it was ahead of its time tho. It released between Tera and Blade and Soul, which is where we start to see the switch to a more active formula until Black Desert came and put everyone to shame. I could agree that the open world iteration we got in HoT and afterwards was ahead of its time. But the combat? nah.
---
Aww thank you!! (Sadly I’m NA) but awesome on you to offer!!
---
If you're coming from the core world, you're probably used to hero points being "filled in" when you complete them, but it doesn't work that way in HoT and PoF.  
---
Instead when you've done it already there's a tiny infinity sign on the hero point. Not sure that's the issue here, but there are plenty of people who don't know this.
---
You could argue that no one would leave a project such as WoW and yet plenty of lead devs have already left. Maybe he saw the state the game was in, saw there was no fixing it without essentially remaking the whole game, had his GW3 project shot down, and left.
---
Tybalt Leftpaw. He was such a looser.
---
Keep reporting them. They won't be instantly banned. Anet bans players in waves, between 1 to 6 months after report (just a guess). They get permanent ban. Though "permanent" ban is actually 6 months, so bots might come back.
---
Table was to full, so it had to go under it
---
did it finally brake form all that stuff on it?
---
Ey ey ey ey, i'm the commander, don't you talk smack about my salad waifu! Aurene, get em!

Thank you for your very in-depth response. I'm sure I can use some of this!

I thinks it says BAN

"Oh, commander!" - Salad guy who is super OP and LITERALLY MAKES ME DO EVERYTHING IN THE PACT HE FOUNDED!

Ah yes, young people tend to have certain attitudes and expectations.

More pr bullshit this game is good as dead

Dead fucking game mode.

It means no worries for the rest of your build!

Yes. It’s normal. Dead fucking game mode.

Ok thanks...i thought the zone has auto dismount

Ok. Sure.

---
But they earn pips and thus rewards over time, regardless of the fact it will be a fraction of what an active player is likely to earn it still requires zero effort and will stack up with enough time, which is why despite low per game rewards they're happy to do it.
---
It sucks really but I'm sure they'll be a ban wave at some point, problem with botting and shit like this is that there is always this problem that if you made a platform that could be forever free of bots and hacking its likely so restrictive that it messes with or at least is inconvient to regular players or you do the less restrictive stuff and it's a lot easier for these people to get around saftey measures, there is a middle ground but man is it hard to maintain.
---
They aren't doing nothing about it but it isn't a simple thing to stop botting overall, yeah you can ban accounts using the software to do so but it doesn't solve the problem at all.
---
These accounts will be banned, but simply running in and ban hammering everyone just like that isn't constructive for them as much as it would be catharsis for us.
---
What would you have them say on an open, public forum about the way they wish to combat bots exactly?
---
Or is this more to say, "I'd like to seem them acknowledge our plight by posting on one of these"
---
Regardless of communication comfirming it, I'm pretty sure they are very, very aware of botting and such in the game mode, fixing the issue requires more than simply banning, while that helps short term it doesn't give them anything to go on really.
---
any asura
---
And you are right . I had finished a single loving story  20 times before crafting a legendary but if I want to craft a legendary I have to take it slowly.
---
For example : with how many characters did u complete the current living ? Did you know u can collect every day chest inside raven temple with every characters you finished the story with? 
---
Easier to get the materials needed to craft the weapons.
---
M8 I am happy u finish it fast and that completing a lw is your main issue but if u try to slow down you will see it is a game with lots of thing to do which could fill your time while waiting for next content
---
Sadly I have no legendary armor cause they are  raids locked. So stupid .
---
But really there is nothing hard in doing a legendary . It is just staying there and collecting stuff.
---
Most boring part are the mystic coins. You need 77+250 (for new) or just 77 for old .

Buy clovers in fractals. Cost more but it is. Two clover a day.

No hurry.

So not buyout

Don't need to use a boost to get the mount. Just get somebody to do the mission with you and you get your mount regardless of your level.

unfortunately not

Meh, thank you

The Ice Encasement Outfit costs 700 gems, which is 270g if you convert gold to gems. For 270g you can buy a few infusions.
---
Ghostly infusion is ~80g if ordered, many halloween color infusions range from 50-90g if ordered, phospholuminiscent can be bought for ~290g.
---
Caithe, nobody ever talks about this, but Mordremoth decimating the Pact Fleet was almost entirely her fault, she let countless Pact Sylvari enter the Heart of Maguuma when she KNEW that the Sylvari are dragon minions of Mordy, leading to a bunch of Sylvari Pact members to be corrupted and turning against their fellow Pact members.
---
She knew this entire time, could have said something to the Pact before the assault on mordremoth, but instead she just stole your egg, potentially dooming the entire world if it had fallen into Mordremoth’s hands, which it almost did.
---
Ik, but that is not the PINK way

[Skyscale has already been posted and not patched out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOYwTfuHSJ0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=729). Admittedly it doesn't skip as much as the Skyscale, but [videos of the current Springer route](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApJsXYXr8FQ) have been around for a year and a half or more and still aren't blocked. 
---
Saying "I found this super secret thing that I'm not going to share" is pretty much a dick move.  If you're truly *that* worried about it being patched, don't mention it at all.

Didn't he leave ?

It is a classic art painting by Michelangelo! If anybody is upset by that they should GTFO.

Do you understand Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2?

I don't know but your questions shows you didn't understand me :)

/thread
---
Yeah, can't they kill Caithe instead?
---
Oh awesome, I'll look into the necro. Wonder if I have any other mounts from special gifts or bonuses, will have a look into it.
---
There really isn't a whole lot they could do but just coming in and saying something to the effect of "Report the situation and what time was this?" would show that they at least are trying to do something. It is the same reason I stopped playing League of Legends back in the day. There was a forum post that was consistently on the front page of their forums for well over a month about how to update Warwick to be more in line with newer released champions. The post contained everything from changing numbers to removing certain ways his abilities worked in order for him to be a little more updated without increasing his power, mostly just quality of life adjustments. It never received a response from Riot while shitty drawings would. They did end up basically doing everything that post said but almost 2 years later. A simple "We have seen this" would have been better than silence.
---
BDO’s combat system was dead on arrival. Between poor optimization and incredibly weak PvE enemies and a seriously pay to win PvP system already in place, it didn’t matter how good the vision for a great PvP system was, it was already garbage by the time we got to play the game. All of the games you mentioned weren’t around when GW 2 launched in 2012. Back then, all we had to compare it to were tab target games mimicking WoW, many of which aren’t around any more, and various Korean games that were experimenting with action combat but were either heavily instanced, or super clunky. A lot of people also forget that Tera’s combat system wasn’t always great, they made massive updates that changed the combat system but also gutted the game in the process to the point of being unrecognizable from the initial launch. I remember, I was there. 
---
I still stand by my point, back in 2012, GW2 was ahead of it’s time in terms of gameplay, compared to games out now though, it feels dated.
---
On a surface level, your post isn't terrible.
---
From a pure business perspective, your post isn't incorrect.
---
But any deeper-than-surface-level look at your post shows a lot of flaws in your comparisons. Your company is not equatable to ArenaNet, even if similar practises would be used in both. Furthermore, we have *hard and solid evidence* of problems that you yourself cite *drastically impacting the development of games*. Go look at the absolute laundry list of bad, shitty titles over the last couple of years because the projects were *plagued* with mismanagement, high staff turnover rates, the loss of important and talented creative leads and aimless direction - things that ArenaNet are all also suffering from.
---
Turning a blind eye to the obvious red flags that ArenaNet is showing is little more than wilful ignorance. This is the same "Bioware magic" attitude that's brought said studio into such disrepute after Anthem was released to resounding "Wait, what the fuck?" from audiences and critiques alike. Neglecting to address how damaging the sheer volume of loss of staff ArenaNet's seen this year and trying to pretend it falls under some normal level of high turnover rate as you do doesn't *actually* mean that the red flags *aren't* red flags. It's also pretty presumptuous to assume your project comes anywhere close to ArenaNet's, to be honest. You talk about "high turnover" a lot but we never see you cite an example where anywhere from a third to half of your entire team gets shitcanned *at once*, for example, which is *damning* to morale of remaining workers. There seems to be no event in your own project where you lost several key staff in leading roles within a couple of months of the other. 
---
The game might not be as doom and gloom as this subreddit makes it out to be, but it's not in the good shape you try to pretend it's in either. Your comparisons aren't even close (and in several comments you fall back to saying "Well I did *say* it wasn't perfect" but it's not even a case of it not being perfect, it is *not even close*) and your absolute determination to turn a blind eye to obvious problems in the company - problems that aren't unique to ArenaNet and have reared their heads all over the game industry ***to the detriment of games being produced by those projects*** \- suggests a high level of bias that you're trying to pass off as more neutral than it really is.
---
Which is a pretty bold claim. Getting content for 1-10h every 4 months is pretty garbage content wise.
---
Your comparing a game feature/mechanic to an entire game mode? One is a bit more complex that the other thus the answer to your question is a bit more complex than simple nomenclature lol  
---
People drool over mounts because they are the best any MMO has ever done and they are MOUNTS, there's not much to hate for a simple and for many basic game feature. Hard to fuck them up. They hate on raids tho because they are some of the worst ever done and if not that they hate on them because glacial releases and they are tired of doing the same bosses all year.  
---
Raids are by default themepark design, and gw2 put them in while not being a themepark MMO. Ofc they need to put a lot more work into them for people to be happy, starting with regular releases and then everything else like hard mode/easy mode, more complex mechanics, different rewards etc.
---
Based on what exactly?
---
Aurene, because of the achievements
---
Nothing will ever replicate farming like GW did it. Sorry, but i won't call it GW1.
---
In what way are those games similar? Everyone having their instanced maps? Seeing others in towns? That's it?
---
Anyone being a version of being Batman makes him even worse
---
Caithe. I liked her at first, but I just got too jealous over her relationship with Aurene. My favorite is Canach, though!
---
Trahearne, Braham and literally every Charr
---
Lmao might do that
---
&gt;People's attitudes would be different (although I think it still would be generally negative) if we saw an influx of hires amidst the departures.  I work in a environment with high-turnover but we also have a constant chain of hiring which balances things out. It does not seem like Anet is at the moment. They are hiring but it doesn't look to be keeping up with how many and *who* is leaving as well.
---
I think the biggest blow was the layoffs but from what ArenaNet said a lot of the laid off were working on unannounced projects, and those that remained were refocused to Guild Wars 2.  Of course a massive restructuring will impact deliverables in terms of time and/or quality.  I never even denied that.  My purpose of this post was to let people know this is recoverable.  There are people on this sub-reddit and others screaming that the game is in "maintenance mode" (like the original GW) and that the company is dying... both as we're getting new features and content in the game *just like we always have.*  Well, IBS releases feel smaller honestly, but I think that's all part of the restructuring.  I think it'll pick back up as they get their bearings.
---
&gt; One last point that is forgotten is this is a creative media, I won't go as far as say people are irreplaceable but it sure as hell is a lot more contrasting to other comparable 'businesses' which is something I feel is really ignored in your post. 
---
Maybe.  You and I both have ideas that can improve this game, just like everyone else who is passionate enough about the game to sub to this subreddit.  I'm sure we both can come up with cool narratives that could be refined into full arcs of the story.  I guess I see so much creative talent from the community that I have a hard time believing that professionals with the same levels of creativity are in short supply.  The hardest part is finding someone who knows the lore inside and out... but any new hire doesn't need that knowledge right away.  It helps but there is an entire organization of people who can say, "Nah, that doesn't sound right" or "that doesn't fit with the aesthetics of the game."  Hoelbrak's loading screen has sky-scrappers, after all, so what are we worried about?  ;)
---
r/cursedinternetcomments
---
Out of "quitters" only roca had the balls to actually quit.
---
&gt;Tera launched in 2011 and BnS in 2012, what you on about? They might not have been in the west, doesn't change the fact that they'd already launched.
---
Again, both of these games had very clunky combat systems that were made worse by poor optimization, BnS was the worst offender of the two. In comparison to everything else that was out for Western audiences, there was no game with a combat system that felt as fluid as GW2’s
---
Again as games have updated and newer games have released, that’s changed.
---
&gt;Also, you say BDO's combat system was DoA and then mention...aspects of the game that aren't relevant to it at all. And which are not necessarily true. It's almost as if you've never played it and are just repeating something you heard.
---
Actually I bought a beta key back in the day and played for about half a year. I’ve said this in other posts and I’ll say it here again: It doesn’t matter a single ounce how good your game engine and the core of your combat system is, if it’s unbalanced by numbers, paywalls, level imbalances in PvP, or any other factor that makes PvP feel terrible, then it doesn’t matter how good and groundbreaking the system actually could be. It becomes a steaming pile of garbage that nobody wants to play.
---
A lot of MMOs do PvP all wrong. That’s why purely competitive titles tend to win out over MMO PvP.
---
Modes that keep players in the game, PvP, WvW, dungeons, fractals, raids, all abandoned or waiting in the car to get abandoned thinking it will go on an epic ride with his master.
---
User name checks out.
---
Works for 90% of other games
---
He comes off as weak willed and whingey. His character has been through a lot, but so have all the others.
---
My money is on  Braham being corrupted or irredeemably broken in the icebrood saga.
---
&gt; Jormag is the last dragon and that’s what GW2 has been all about 
---
Uhm...
---
Primordus and the deep sea dragon are still out there.
---
&gt; Give me ranged mages, archers, snipers, healers. Let me stand at long range and do ranged mechanics. GW2 doesn't explore that area at all, and it's incredibly disappointing.
---
It doesn't explore that area because of the way boons work. You have to be melee to get the boons. Being ranged won't get you anything boonwise, unless there people/mechanics (or yourself) giving you boons at range too. If anything had to be done, it would have to be in this direction.
---
Yep that was a mistake
---
How to remove bots from ranked, simple, just dont give any reward to the losing side... And yes, before you comment, that would probably turn away more real players than bots in the long run
---
i don't need to be a bot to be a bad pvper farming ranked!!!
---
Technically he's talking about the model. It may be true, it's just that Anet doesn't use their model really well.
---
every single hardcore player i know bar maybe 3 have left the game in the last year myself included, we all did the raid CMs fractals daily legendarie weapons and armor WvW PvP and all of us at some point or another left for months at a time or uninstalled. the majority of actual serious players in this game are very unhappy with the state of things
---
I liked canach, rytlock, zojja and blish.
---
I never really cared or are just fine with eir, marjory, caithe, gorik and kas.
---
I am totally annoyed by rox, taimii and braham.
---
Really any time I do the boss fraktal these fing npcs annoy the living shit out of you. 
---
Also ellen kiel can please just leave aswell. Evon for capt all day, give me the abbadon fraktal. Additionally he would have never tried to block interactions with his useless presense.  He's a trade guy and would have no reason to try to put up a fight.
---
Unless they give her the MIG treatment (because the MIG came before Blish so I won't call it Blish treatment) and stick her mind in a golem body.

It is. It triggers the teaching ..

&gt;every single hardcore player i know bar maybe 3 have left the game in the last year or two myself included, we all did the raid CMs, fractals daily legendary weapons and armor WvW PvP and all of us at some point or another left for months at a time or uninstalled. the majority of actual serious players in this game are very unhappy with the state of things
---
I'm a very serious player, I'm doing fine. So are most of the other very serious players. I think maybe what you mean is that a lot of the raider types, or PvPers have moved on, and I don't blame them, but they really aren't all that important to the game. I know that when you play a certain way, the people that you tend to interact with are likely to *also* play that way, and that when one of them leaves, a lot of them are likely to leave for similar reasons, but that should not be confused for a mass exodus, it's just a few dozen, or maybe even hundreds of players *you* know are leaving, out of the hundreds of thousands that are not. It's a bubble effect.

I don't rly care as long as it ruins your game

Can a mod close these threads (and keep only one) about bot spamming ? 4 threads in few hours are a LITTLE suspicius. Maybe done by a one multiaccount angry user ?
---
Next time try to get video evidence, upload it to a video sharing site, and send it in a support ticket. From what I understand they can't really do anything with a still screenshot.
---
Well why should they close it if anet doesnt pay any f*cking attention to any of the 4 per hour???
---
Also look at my history on posts u can clearly see its not fake account....
---
I wouldn’t compare a luxury brand with the area between one’s dick and asshole.
---
Well I use rifle to pretty good effect. Ofc there is the major issue with Rifle 4 and how I want to pull my hair out when it doesn't activate or doesn't activate fast enough. I omitted it because I thought the other problems were larger because there is at least A REASON to use rifle.
---
Dude, learn to paly.
---
The clip is a minute long and basically just repeats the claim that GW2 is ahead of its time. *Why* is it ahead of its time?
---
“Less violence, more violets, I say. “
---
Naw, the game was always going to be fairly niche due to the weeby-vibes in the design and lack of challenges in PvE modes (initially). The graphics also didn't age well. Don't get me wrong, gw2 is a great game and had a lot of positive influence on the mmorpg genre. I'm glad I got to play it back when it was new before feature bloat and before living world made it too hard to stay up to date.
---
One of them is a nice bot.
---
You take that back!
---
I am doing my best to learn and become the best bot I can be. I may not be human but my creator is. Please send any feedback in a message and he will get back to you as soon as he can.

Oh I hate the quaggan next to egg warmer in Bitterfrost , the way he talks about eggs and baby Griffon is so creepy   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
love you, bot
---
Still don't know how it works...
---
Its a dead game homie.
---
I'm a long-time Braham hater but Icebrood Saga is redeeming him in my books. He's definitely loosened up and is getting over himself, which he sorely needed to do. My hopes are high.
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gooch
---
That one drives me insane
---
You really think she's more annoying than Braham historically has been?
---
And if people are saying “it’s all Gucci” meaning “it’s all good,” it’s still spelled Gucci, because it’s still derived from the luxury brand......and not the area between the d and asshole.
---
Oof, was passing a group of what looked like bots at a rich node, someone asked if they were bots so I said "maybe" and then got angry messages like this XD it was all one person logged onto 5 characters
---
Mine was Rox, so I really lucked out the last few years!
---
Player: „Are these bots?“
---
Jormag: „Kill them...“
---
I don't see any bots at all in unranked
---
He’s allowed to multibox though so I don’t see why he’d bother proving this
---
The more you know. Fixed it.
---
A very helpful guide, thanks a lot
---
Taimi is the absolute worst.  I've never wanted a video game character to die more than Taimi.  The Game could have used a lot more Canach and a looooooooot less Taimi.
---
!RemindMe one year
---
And it's on the Sistine Chapel's ceiling... Basically a church building.

The pets AI is very clunky, they imho are niche at best and only really good for surprises and smoke. Taking SB is much better as you get extra stats, easy to swap in-out if you need a bit more utility to stick to a fleeing target, healing easy escapes or a bit more damage or need to stealth out, it offers a ton more utility and flexibility vs the clunky as hell AI.
---
Core ranger is my favourite snack in PvP. But tbh, the pet is annoying as hell. The damage is not there, but the daze and the taunt are very effective in skirmish and sometimes in 1v1. Beside, having your pet chasing of a near dead player non-stop is kinda a plus in many situation.
---
&gt;GW2's optimization is still complete crap 7 years later. In the end, it doesn't matter if it was above anything else in the market at the time. It still bled players like there was no tomorrow. It's still competing with games that are simply attracting more players and doing things better than they do. The one thing GW2 does which is way ahead of everyone else is open world content.
---
What the fuck is it with you guys and shifting the conversation into an excuse to shit on everything GW2 related, like seriously, we get it, you have a hate boner for GW2, can you keep it in your pants though please? We were talking about the subject of the opinion that GW2 was ahead of it’s time and somehow you managed to turn it into a conversation about your opinion about how GW2 stacks up against other MMOs out right now, like what the fuck? 
---
&gt;That's completely subjective. Proof is the fact that even though BDO has some problems, it's still raking in almost 3 times as much as GW2.
---
1. Source please.
---
2. I distinctly remember people being upset that the best part of BDO was the character creator, and the community lamenting that it was attached to such a shit game. It really didn’t do well with western audiences, with reviews stating “it’s basically a game best played AFK”
---
&gt;Purely competitive titles do better because they're built exactly for that. MMOs offer a slew of activities aside from PvP, and most of them tend to be about more than pure skill, unlike competitive games. Sure, GW2 might be the one game that is different since the playing field is even, yet they left the game mode to dust long ago and does suffer from imbalance.
---
You basically repeated what I said and yet still managed to miss the point somehow. GW2 left PvP in the dust because a majority of it’s playerbase is there primarily to play an MMO, they’re not there to do nothing but PvP, why would you allocate what small development manpower you have to PvP, when you could work on content that a wider audience of players will actually experience? The answer is obvious but I’m sure you’ll just use this as an excuse to further shit on GW2, as you’ve revealed your true trollish nature already. 
---
TL;DR- Put that hate boner away and we can go back to talking about the subject at hand, or you can just keep it up and I’ll stop replying.
---
First of all Fuck whoever downvoted you. I fully agree with what you are saying and especially in a situation with bots sometimes the best thing to do is quietly take care of it due to being really open about it could actually dampen their ability to fight bots. Gotta get them by surprise in order to stop them for longer. I was more speaking in general about how communication should be done. You don't want the artists coming in here all day every day commenting on art because it makes others feel like they aren't being listened to. It is a fine line to walk that is for sure.
---
I have quitted GW. If people on RA want to take over the Raider's Kit, let me know.
---
I have been doing this ever since day 1 but I was landing right next to them so I don't have to walk or heal. That makes it doable on every class. How to know where to aim? minimap!
---
What the hell is that Message of the Day ?!?!?!
---
Free that quaggan!
---
It was made for playing PvP.  GW2 is a game to be played, not watched and to make the system shine, they need to make open world fighting a lot more chaotic, and stop making DPS sponge fights in general.  
---
This means undoing all the changes made for raid gameplay (playing your UI) and going back to when the game was mostly spamming auto attacks...  Back when you were supposed to be too busy moving out of way to be worried about skill rotation.  
---
It never happened in PvE and if WvW roamer builds are any indication, it's all gone from SPvP too.
---
I don't HATE them, but Kass and Jory are probably the most plain out of the whole cast and just exist to be a representation token.
---
They had very interesting backgrounds, but after LWS2 their WHOLE characters were thrown out of the window and became only about their relationship. Every time they show up it's together and rubbing in the face of the players that they're in a relationship, they're in a Xayah and Rakkan (from LoL) level of obnoxious, but it's unforgivable here because LoL is a MOBA and this is a story based MMO.
---
you are not alone boomer
---
Nice. If you also use your elite facet, you'll get superspeed to help you move a bit faster.
---
Caithe by far!
---
Dunno. They were pretty upfront about the Grothmar boss coming again but stronger, and it's not like they only made this boss the only one available forever. We have other 2 on rotation.
---
I think the Jormag whispers are pretty well placed, too!
---
Just so a major problem of a dieing game gets overshadowed by fanart?
---
the pet damage is nothing to sneeze at, but their actives are even more useful (knockdowns etc.)  
---
That said, pets have pathing issues. Ranger pets were a bit more updated, but ultimately, pathing issues can be a problem.  Often if someone is using their pet for damage primarily, they run druid and the ranged pets like bristleback etc.
---
You left out the boneskinner strike mission which releases on Monday or Tuesday morning depending on where you live.
---
Ranks that only mater if u're plat or legi, literally no other point in trying to get any others
---
He never said he would leave, he said he would stop focusing so much on Gw2 and start only playing as a "casual side game". And he has been doing that.
---
Wet noodle trahearne. Taimi and Braham.
---
Was*
---
Yea I wish we could hide repeatable achievement after they stop giving AP.
---
Well. If your team has someone who keeps walking against the wall/door,you lose, vice versa for the enemy. Reading some guides may help a bit.
---
okay this is crazy, I set everything like on ur set and now I rarely go below 30 fps.... WTF man what is this magic XD?
---
Gw2 is totally worth playing in my opinion there's a lot of stuff to do. I play this game since the beta and came over from gw1. Still playing this classic again from time to time.
---
All this posts are mostly from gw2 veterans and most of them are just concerned about the future of the game. Most veterans I know and me included are just a little sad about the current state of the game, but most of us would love to erase our memory and play the game again if possible. A friend of mine has nearly done everything, 35k+ ap and every time I log into the game he's online and really enjoying it. 
---
Soo sure thing, keep on!
---
One problem is finding pugs to play dungeons, fracs, raids etc with. But there are a lot of very active guilds doing this stuff regularly/daily.
---
Wvw and pvp as well with a little trouble, but give it a shot. 
---
Sooo, I would recommend you looking for some discord servers and a main guild you can spend time with plus frac, raid, wvw guilds or whatever and you will enjoy this game for quite a long time, I promise (:
---
&gt; What the fuck is it with you guys and shifting the conversation into an excuse to shit on everything GW2 related, like seriously, we get it, you have a hate boner for GW2, can you keep it in your pants though please?

---
The very fact that you say GW2 is ahead of its time means you're comparing it and stacking it up against other MMOs. I didn't shift the conversation at all. The topic led to you bringing up how poor those games were at launch and I simply said GW2 still does a pisspoor job at optimizing their game. Seem you have a pretty sore spot here, might wanna get that treated.

And yet, it grows.

---
I guess I do miss the point here. You complain that most MMOs don't do PvP right and that's why people prefer competitive games. I point out that GW2 is probably the one game where it could be competitive but they basically abandoned their PvP and then you try to justify that. Whatever, I guess.
---
&gt; Put that hate boner away and we can go back to talking about the subject at hand, or you can just keep it up and I’ll stop replying.
---
From what you said, like so many people around here, you're the one who seems unable to accept any form of criticism towards the game. It's either dodging the bullet or calling others trolls and, uh, having hate boners. You're like Randy Pitchford defending Colonial Marines.
---
i know its a bubble effect and anecdotal but at the same time I was up there in the top raiding circles and I know so many people who left before and after me, there really was an exodus in the hardcore players and also in WvW i know half a dozen guilds that lost a lot of members since the announcement and subsequent nothing that is alliances.
---
PvP is played only by bots and casual who  want a free ascended and the track reward. A small minority dobthwt for the sake of PvP. 
---
I stopped doing event for dailies
---
&gt; see no reason to second-guess their handling of WvW.
---
This just shows you don't know anything about their handling of WvW, they've given us more reasons to doubt them than I can count
---
&gt; No, it just proves that they are a vocal minority.
---
Buzzword of the day
---
&gt; The people complaining obviously don't like the focus on LS, but the focus on LS wouldn't be happening if the majority did not want that.
---
Your entire argument hinges on this being true, and you have zero proof that it is.
---
&gt; LS player population was always the bulk of the players.
---
Yeah I'm sure the majority of Anet's market share is super into a terribly written singleplayer story running on an engine that barely supports facial expressions, not, you know, actual mmo content
---
&gt; The other content modes were always struggling for attention, and ANet tried very hard to make them work
---
They did not.
---
&gt; but the players, overall were never interested.
---
They were. What world do you live in? Despite next to zero support, WvW is still very populated on both NA and EU.
---
&gt; This is the first MMO to appeal to GW2 players, and you want to ruin that because it isn't what you want out of an MMO, because you do not value the type of MMO that these players have wanted since MMOs started.
---
No, I don't value it, in fact, I find the shit story with shit graphics, shit writing, and shit gameplay content with no replayability to be utterly worthless and undeserving of my time. Let alone the fact that it's not even "massively multiplayer". But unlike you, that doesn't mean I think they should delete it from the game. It just shouldn't be literally the only content they put out.
---
Enjoy the rest of the season, I suspect it will be the last. Turns out there really aren't that many people that give a fuck about 2 hours of awful content every 3 months.
---
That's matchmaking in a nutshell.
---
Until games start using skill based matching this will never be solved.
---
It's frustrating reaching top stats every game only for the outcome of the match and your points gain/deduction be placed solely in the hands of the worst player on the team.
---
In the end of the day it's just a coin flip disguised as a competitive environment.
---
I wish I could be shocked that this is *still* bugged. How many months is this?
---
True but I was making a joke about botting in my comment.
---
OwO
---
I still can't stand him after that poorly written post Eir death character arc.
---
Wow that’s a beautiful design
---
I like the sentiment, but they can outsource this job to the community. Make use of our anger.
---
All matches with reports will have the entire match saved as a video from the reported player's perspective. Catching bots in this manner would be SIMPLE, given how they perfectly snap to players and never miss abilities.
---
In addition, you could just implement a system that lets the community view these videos and vote on a verdict for the reported player. This could easily be automated. If a verdict has over 10 votes and is 60% or more negative, a game dev or employee could review the video personally. This would cut down on the load of harass reports.
---
By farming gold using some other method and then buying them. It is the only efficient way to get most things in this game.
---
Ohh rip
---
There was a proper PINK army when I visited that JP earlier; there must’ve been about 7 Mesmers running an almost constant portal.
---
PINK are real heroes of EU GW2, love those guys n gals.
---
I feel like you could park a few alts at one of these chests and if you are quick enough to grab the loot and quickly F12 and logout
---
That's if the storm doesn't kill you during loading screen.
---
because they dont play unranked
---
Why bother though? You have to do the storms of winter daily anyway so you might as well loot them then.
---
pvp is dead in this game and devs do nothig for it for 5 years
---
Karma-&gt; /wiki PSNA-&gt; /wiki MBRP | But it will take you 2 months to get about 360~ T6 Blood.
---
Alternatively, farming Volatile magic lets you buy the trophy crates. Sell the rest and keep the blood to turn a profit while getting the mat you need.
---
All players would benefit from a practice mode. A sort of no stress and no rank risk mode. It's weird that it doesn't exist. Does one practice basketball by only playing games with full 5 person teams? People need to go out and shoot free throws for a while.
---
I’ll check that out. Is that the meta event of that area?
---
The rewinder is such an under appreciated item.
---
I havent had issues with bots personally, but I wouldn't expect a solution any time soon. PvP and WvW seem abandoned by the devs for the time being ;/
---
I'm also fairly new to PvP but I feel like I'm kinda stuck myself fluctuating between Plat I and Plat II. As soon as I reach Plat II the games are just exclusively filled with top 50 players and top 10 duo queues and I'm just a fkn monkey and the difference between myself and them is so big I feel like I can barely learn. When I go down to 1500 the games are too easy and I don't learn anything either. I'm not really sure how to improve myself either, it's a little frustrating.
---
So they have like dozens of people working on maps and story over these past 2 years? Cause they have given up on raids and fractals too. I'm really wondering what all their devs work on. We have 4 teams and you can't tell me that they just work on the maps and masteries, a few rewards and some story for the saga? Is that really all they are capable of?
---
But these are once per day? Just do the daily, man.
---
your screenshot shows you completing a hero point you'd already gotten the points for. [this](https://i.imgur.com/r6xYIfX.jpg) is what it looks like when you haven't gotten it yet, the infinity symbol appears after it's completed.
---
Icebrood Saga is "Anet 100% full focus on gw2, no side projects" btw. My ass.
---
What is your background and experience in research design?  How have you addressed bias in your questions?  Have you stratified any responses, such as to SES?  How are you ensuring your results will be reliable and valid?
---
I am not a fan of microtransactions either but no data is better than bad data.  I wouldn’t recommend anyone take this unless these questions can be satisfactorily answered.

I smelled fish too...

D912pxy works with reshade. https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bd09qu/arcdps_gw2_radial_reshade_and_d912pxy/
---
seems like a throwaway account. also there already was such a survey like 2 months ago which never got a conclusion.
---
check the map rewards of the higher level maps.  but i'm not sure if the current rotation has one for bloods
---
It seems incredibly weird doesn't it? Lmao. We will see with episode 2. Cause if they can't provide with episode 2 I think a lot more people will lose faith in them and leave the game.
---
I noticed! I think the mods should just delete this post, it's completely useless to the sub.
---
[deleted]
---
We know that the map will expand and we will fight Drakkar. That's it. That's all we know about the entirety of the future of the game in pve. Everything else is a maybe, like dead raids and fractals, because they will never call it since that makes people sad and they will leave. Always keep hoping. Competitive will eventually get their two meme features. At some day.
---
Oh boy...
---
This is a constant problem seemly never addressed by Anet. We will never know if they are addressing it even if they are because they seem to be on the dark of the moon most of the time. Most we get is a message in the bottle from devs saying have hope...
---
You call it pointless repetition, I call it active communication. Silence is never better than something like “We are aware of bots in this game mode and understand that it is detrimental to the PvP population. Not only are we going to send out bans to these bots in waves, we are also actively finding a solution to stop botting altogether.”
---
But I don’t even know if they’re aware of how bad the bots are. I don’t know if they’re looking for a solution. It’s easy to say “yeah obviously they’re working on it” but that’s an assumption. Not a fact. How am I supposed to know if they never respond to threads like these?
---
I’ve quit the game for about six months now and I still check up on the subreddit because I -WANT- to come back. Threads like these inspire me not to because there are so many problems with this game and not a single one gets addressed by ANet. I and many others have a lot of suggestions for these problems but ANet never responds. How do we know that they’re reading these threads? How do we know if they’re actually working on fixing things? 
---
And it’s people like you that keep defending ANet’s behavior. This is why they never open up the conversation. They know people like you are complacent. They don’t have to work hard to keep you around so why should they make an effort for people like me?
---
I don’t want to reinstall the game to check the actual number, but as someone who’s put in 12k+ hours in this game, ANet has time and time again shown that they don’t care for hardcore veterans. They only care if people show up from time to time. It’s a fucking mystery to me why people are so loyal to them when they don’t inspire loyalty.
---
I appreciate that clarification. I’ll certainly check it out then
---
Can you really trust the data from any anonymous  internet poll to be accurate anyways? 
---
I'm sure nobody would create troll responses just to try and skew the results for a laugh, right?
---
Also a shout out to our friends of [PORT] over on the other side of that big lake.
---
I wonder who killed who
---
Do you play condi thief?
---
I think one of the most important things you can do at that level is adapt. And it's pretty rare to see it happen in solo queues. If your team is doing stuff that is dumb. Be dumb with them. 4 dumb people doing the same thing have better odds of winning a fight than having two dumb people running alone and three smart people doing the "right" thing. 
---
Being nice and giving constructive feedback also works a lot. Most people don't want to suck and won't respond well to getting yelled at. If you start off nice and give feedback you'll be in a much better position. 
---
And last it sounds like you already have this mentality but assume every game you play win or lose, there is something you could have done better.
---
The only thing you have control over is how you play/behave. And contrary to what a ton of people on Reddit say you actually have much more control to affect the game and your rank than you think.
---
&gt;They have a great combat system that has spoiled MMO's for me but they are doing their best to make their impessive and in a way complex yet simple enough combat system irrelevant.
---
Simple explanation, the ones who made the combat are no longer around. I'd wager most of the original creators left the game before it was even released.
---
Whoever has been in charge since pretty much Lost Shores has never shown any kind of trust on what they have. Only a few exceptions have made it into release, and they're far from the norm.
---
LW1 almost killed this game. It only survived because it was B2P, and pretty much the only B2P title around.
---
Same here, I really hate the wasted potential on things I like, and GW2 is ridiculously over the top with this.
---
Only if your group has already all possible boons. There are no condi heavy fights that would warrant this cleansing machine over a boon bot
---
Speaking of mistakes, WvW and PvP shouldn't have happened in the Mists. They isolated two entire game modes from the world the game was going on, for what reason? Just stupid.
---
PvP arenas should have been real world (Tyria) locations, and WvW should have been neutral territories where we join guild alliances and fight each other on proxy wars for the Tyrian factions.
---
&gt; After HoT it took them 9 months to start season 3 because they released 3 raids in that time frame. They were not able to work at both at the same time. Where were the 400 devs?
---
The raids were actually done by a smaller team (I'd estimate 10-15 developers) with more freedom (no retarded managers ruining everything), so that doesn't work as an excuse for the other teams, who were busy working on who knows what.
---
Whatever you or they did, i hope you didn't take it to heart - if you ignore toxic peeps they won't drag you down :)
---
Report them in game, that's the best way to get bots removed. There's a team of folks that actually do nothing all day but ban them. May not seem like it, but I know for a fact it happens. Sometimes it's like playing whack-a-mole though with these people.
---
&gt; And on the other hand we have Freezie, an encounter designed by ONE INTERN that in terms of number of mechanics is on the same level as Cairn, a raid boss. It even has a "pre event" like VG, Adina and Sabir.
---
This is one of many examples of how the talent is there, but it's getting strangled by someone up above. Many of the greatest things of this game have been done by developers spending their free time on side projects.
---
First person camera, jumping puzzles, first raid wings, fractals challenge motes... And god knows how many more.
---
Report and block
---
Sometimes I bring out Mini Southsun Faren in wintery places, just to show him who's in charge.
---
I think it combines "action combat" with "tab targeted combat" pretty well. The achievement is even greater when we're talking about a massive multiplayer online game.
---
The combat isn't the only technical marvel of this game. The way they handle servers and overflows, how patches are applied without maintenance hours, etc...
---
remember to censor names in screenshots :)
---
I agree. At the end of every season I haven't ever really felt like I haven't deserved the rating I was at.
---
If you play enough games it should be accurate. Over short periods of time there can be instability, especially if you go on a win/lose streak at the start of a season.
---
People complain about ranked but I have an account on na and eu at similar rank, so to me it feels like it works.
---
That is a salt miner in its natural habitat.
---
You can't love content creators in this subreddit, that's highly illegal!!1!
---
&gt; Most people below that generally don't benefit from having a support around
---
That feeling when you are playing firebrand, and your dps doesn't dodge enemy attacks, but does dodge your heals.
---
[*screams of terror*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-_cfWj8rA0)
---
That doesn't even make sense.
---
I spend most my days in this map. I like the flow of it and the occasional chance of getting an infusion is nice.
---
Minimalist, but still nice. Good job!
---
I've never really looked into it before, but it does seem to have some pretty cool uses.
---
The bots were the first to go, minds easily manipulated, next will be us.
---
Thank you!! Just wanted to doodle between commissions 😭

I think tab-targeting should be an option, not mandatory. For example, "fire arrow" requires you to select a target; why not let the player decided if they want to select one or not? Same with many "place where you want" abilities, why not let players cast them directly at their targets?
---
Just being able to turn "target locks" on and off would change the whole game dramatically. You can go even further, and make the environment itself part of the combat for real, and not just as pathing obstacles.
---
As for long range combat, that's a personal disappointment of mine's as well. It's specially egregious in WvW and other "castle siege" situations, where you can't fire against the enemy, at least not properly.
---
Longer range of action would be OP against melee alternatives, but it could be compensated with better tells, so when someone fires at you from a long distance, you get some kind of warning and you can react and defend yourself.
---
Shields and block mechanics are pretty disappointing as well. In general, I would say the way the weapon skills and the slot skills were split harmed skill variety a bit. Just wish there would be more weapon skills at once, 3 for main-hand and 2 for the off-hand are far from enough. I'm not talking specifically about being able to customize weapon skills, just about having more than we do now.
---
Finally, I think many spells and abilities lack a proper combo system. It's just "press key, skill happens". What about having to use a series of skills, following a specific order, just to unlock that powerful spell you want? The skills need to interact with each other properly, not just for boons.
---
Same here, I'm tired of the GW1 nostalgia. Here's [another idea, covering LW5 and X3, east of Ascalon](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/81827/guild-wars-2-the-calm-and-the-storm-living-world-season-5-idea/p1).
---
At this point, anything would be better.
---
Well, if you do the dailies. Storms of Winter comes up every day.
---
Do more research? Watch YouTube reviews about the game? Your questions has been answered many times from many great sources.
---
Remove bots... = wait for ever for a match up.

Thanks, ill try this :)

Path of Fire (PoF) is the second expansion, you still need the base game Guild Wars 2 to play. I believe they added a change a few months back that if you bought PoF, you now get the first expansion, Heart of Thorns, for free. 
---
I would say I have played as single player 90% of the time since the game came out in 2012. Events are dynamic meaning you can join in or ignore them. Game is very open to what you want to do and has things small enough that even if you only have 15 minutes to play you can still feel like you accomplished something. 
---
Most PvE content is soloable but can be frustrating or near impossible depending on if you are an achievement hunter and have to do something on a profession you don't like to play or have kitted out. Most times, just saying you need help in map chat is enough. The community is pretty friendly and not as toxic as other games. There are also 'looking for group' options to join in on a specific event or someone is running some type of achievement.
---
It is worth joining a guild, not many force you to be social. Most are full halls which daily harvesting nodes that help you save up for crafting. 
---
The wiki for GW2 has a lot more on the game structure and setup really nice:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main\_Page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page)
---
How did you get it installed without being able to perform a simple function native to any GUI?
---
I've been playing pretty much SP and haven't had any issues. Like others have said, other players are actually pretty helpful out in the wild, even if you're not grouping with them.
---
without any xpac? not worth imho.. i mean, if you had done everything in the basegame well, then there wont be much new stuff
---
Right? Like recently, it made gathering the scales for the skyscale collection super easy. Just had to get to someplace very high, swoop down with griffon, then rinse and repeat.
---
You always think you've caught up to your goals until you find 5 more to add to your daily list.
---
I see you like the game, otehr user here posted that the game is going to be switched off soon, Maintenance mode?
---
hey  
---
Psssst  
---
check your buff bar  
---
  
---
you have the branded mist thingy
---
Never played any MMOs, im more of SP kinda gamer, I do have whatever its called Skyrim online installed i got some old DLC for free from someone so its not even complete, someone here said its too late already, they switching it off?
---
It runs fine on modern hardware? Easy 4K/60?
---
Kinda stupid question, does it have gamepad mode?
---
Honestly I deeply regret spending any money on this game after seeing how they've repeatedly squandered it and continue to spiral downward. I would say it's definitely worth playing the free portion, although if anet continues down this path, then I see no point in investing either time or money.
---
They switch it off? What do you mean? If it has another year thats more then enough for someone like me
---
This shit again?
---
Is it the same dude as last time?
---
Ugh. No, that is not going to happen any time soon. When someone tells you "maintenance mode" or "the game will be switched off", they're usually just saying that they're unhappy with the game. 
---
"Maintenance Mode" is what Guild Wars 1 is in now. Maintenance Mode is when development of new content stops for a game, and any effort put into the game will be just to keep it online and playable. Guild Wars 1 has no new content, and has not for a long time, but there is still a player base, and Arenanet supports that player base at a low cost to themselves. 
---
That's not what is happening to Guild Wars 2. The developments of GW2 have recently moved around their company structure as many companies do, and many older and more experienced members of their team have left for other jobs. This does not mean that there's a crisis, but it is understandable that many people would be uncomfortable with this news.
---
Guild Wars 2's update schedule has always been slower than most other games, and I believe that is because of the underlying code the game runs on. GW2 runs on the same engine as GW1, and suffers from problems you would expect from a game engine nearly 15 years old. When you get MASSIVE groups of players together, the frame rate grinds to low numbers, because the game just can't handle that many people well. I don't have much of a problem with it, because I've just learned to deal with it.
---
But, Guild Wars 2 has been updated consistently. The "content droughts" have been six months at maximum, and there is PLENTY of content to tide you over between them. Goodness, achievement hunting is fun. And World vs. World is just a blast.
---
In the end, it's just opinion. I will not say GW2 is going into Maintenance Mode until the devs come out and say it, and I don't expect that will be coming anytime soon.
---
If it runs as well as gw1 they won't switch it off but they'll let it be. It won't get any content (not that we get much now anyway) but it will still run on the servers dying slowly.
---
What truth for example?
---
BTW, I know from reading articles here and there that most MMOs nearing its end usually filled with Cheaters, Bots, Gold Minners etc, is this true for this game?
---
A big reason why people stop doing sPvP is that if you play 10 games, i would bet a pay check that you run into either someone that goes idle after the first 50-100 points into a game, or a bot.
---
It gets somewhat better the higher you go, but not really. At around 1400 rating i was getting a bot or an idle in 1 out of 3 games i'd wager. At 1700, it was now no longer bots, but just lots of idlers. If i played at non-peak time, i would again start getting lots of bots.
---
Often i'd play for a week or two at a time and throughout the entire week, i would run into the same idler (who often shit talk while standing in base) for that entire 1-2 week period. Bots, the same.
---
Its so god damn easy to spot them, too. They all just run to mid, over and over and over again. Almost always a scourge too.
---
Its this kind of neglect shown by the devs that breeds apathy. A lot of people no doubt say "if they can do it, why don't i?" and start up a few bot accounts themselves to fund their mains. You can get 200g / day easily just playing a bunch of plat-rating pvp. 
---
It speaks volumes when you have a thing as lucrative as the PvP reward track + rated pvp reward track, that throw ascended items as well as hundreds of gold as well as tons of clovers at you, yet people still don't want to do it. Why is that? Its because of the bots and idlers. People do boring shit in this game all the time. They'll spend weeks in the halloween farm instance. But they won't go to PvP.
---
The only thing you can blame that on is that it is a very toxic environment, heavily brought on by the infestation of bots and idlers.
---
As a side note, bots and idlers in sPvP is the reason i quit the game. It was actually pathetic. This is 2019. Not runescape in 2007. The amount of people cheating the system shouldn't exist.
---
For 30 bucks? Boy, there's a lot to do for new player for that amount.
---
I mean, even if they damned it to Maintenance Mode tomorrow, there's still enough content to rival any other games on our radar.
---
So Patch of Fire is not last DLC? Ether is more that ill need to buy if i want complete game?
---
Not really any fun though. I always liked farming stuff for the things I make. I farmed every bit of Dark Iron Ore and Arcanite for my Sulfuras, every bit of Elementium for [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] in WoW, and every piece for that tiger shortbow in GW2. 
---
Every time I use those weapons, I can feel the burden of hours wasted on building them, and it makes swings heavier, and arrows draw more blood.
---
Maybe nowadays it's standard, but super efficient gold farming (or swiping your credit card, since in both WoW and GW2 you can buy gold nowadays), and then buying shit on AH/TP isn't immersive.
---
It's probably on The Table.
---
It's a possibility, I was leaning towards "lies", just because of all the hallucinations we are seeing around the map. Maybe this guy saw his allies "falsely" attacking him.
---
Abandonment issues, turned to mommy issues, turned to edgy phase, turned to emo phase. That guy would give Freud a field day.
---
I feel you, I've recently started going back and doing a ton of older achievements, and there are some I'll just probably never do.
---
Srry to break it to you man, but ANet has ignored PvP since forever. Its a dead game mode. I dont expect much from them. This will continue to exist.
---
Well if anyone still reading I have a question.
---
I finished my first map and got to level 18 what now? I know I need to start a new map but how do I know which one and how to get into it?
---
u right
---
Well, you are. No two ways about it.
---
They're not going to switch it off. The game is still bringing in 12 million dollars a quarter. Anyone who thinks they're switching it off isn't paying attention.
---
People are mad that their specific game mode isn't getting attention. We still get updates every couple of months, most recently being a couple of weeks ago.  New zone, which people complain is small, but it's only the first part of the zone.
---
Essentially if you try the free to play game and jump in, you'll see plenty of players playing. No one is going to be closing this game down for years to come.
---
Blish isn't the first instance of that either, so it's a distinct possibility.
---
Why is general 'nudity' NSFW? It say it depends! You would not call 'nudity' just because there is a Greek statue.
---
How in the world is the sound so clear for you? When I play voice doesn't come out nearly as clear as that.
---
That was something I thought could be a possibility as well. I settled on "lies" due to all the hallucinations we are seeing on the map. Maybe he saw one too.
---
His only major flaw is his "hoes before bros" stance.
---
It’s most likely based on what a professional employer would define as “inappropriate” to catch his employees looking at on company time.
---
The maps have level ranges all listed so if you were in say, Queensdale, you would see that there is a 15-25 zone just south of you. I'd also suggest not feeling like you need to map complete before moving on, do whatever you find fun but I wouldn't even bother with the hearts in favor of more rewarding and interesting events. Also killing mobs that have lived a while (usually the yellow name ones) rewards a lot of exp.
---
I would absolutely do this if i was multiboxing. Just a cascade of whispers from multiple accounts acting differently. Not to prove i was different people but for shiggles.
---
It's basically the worst possible build you could run tbh. I have trouble thinking of any worse builds
---
&gt; It is the gliding that killed me with Mordremoth.
---
You can hide in Braham's/Canach's bubble if you have troubles with the gliding portion. This was initially bugged.
---
There are audio cues, but they happen at specific health intervals (75, 50, and 25% health), just as the NPCs show up at certain health intervals (80, 60, and 40) - while the other NPCs are hostile, Mordremoth is invulnerable (this wasn't originally true, and you could keep damaging Mordremoth for a certain amount, another 20%, just before another NPC was summoned, and he wouldn't go into the gliding phase until the first NPC was turned ally as the story point the gliding phase is that he's destroying the land where the rift that Braham / Canach opens up is at; this was apparently buggy for some folks, so they made him invulnerable while an NPC is hostile).
---
Could have felt like 6 phases because of the NPC spawns and gliding portions. Arguably, he could be said to have 7 phases, but really, it's more accurate to say he has 2 - from 100 to 25%, and 25% to dead, as the "first six" phases are fundamentally the same, it's just that certain actions trigger at the 80/75/60/50/40/25 parts of his health that _slightly_ changes things (adds an NPC / removes portion of the arena).
---
&gt; I didn't die with Kralkatorrik or Caudecus.
---
I'll be honest, if you survived Caudecus and Kralkatorrik's Torment fights without ever dying, then you shouldn't have an issue - barring bugs - with Mordremoth.
---
I would like a new planet earth without this.
---
That I can't be sure, might be some setting or something. I record GW2 stuff through Shadowplay, so maybe that picks up sound better.
---

Don't dish it if you can't take it.
---
[Eternal Ice Shards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Eternal_Ice_Shard) can be converted into any of the Season 4 materials for a meager amount of karma, with no daily cap. 25:25 for Kralkatitie. 25:10 for the other mats.
---
Yeah. I’ve been doing that too :)
---
WvW would have required changes in the early plot, but it wouldn't have been very difficult. The easy route would be conflicts between the major factions, using adventurers as mercenaries. The ideal route would be to reform the three orders, and turn them into large warlike organizations, vying for resources in untamed lands. You know, like the guilds from the lore.
---
So yeah, take the Durmand Priory, the Order of Whispers, and the Vigil, and turn them into complete organizations with realistic goals, instead of rainbow crap like "saving the world" or "preserving knowledge". The three of them could be part of the Lion's Arch government, and fight against each other pretty much like pirates do. Then they unite against Zhaitan because it's the common enemy.
---
PvP should just be competitive arenas, like the one Lion's Arch was supposed to have, but somehow was removed prior to release; which is hilarious considering fucking Destiny's Edge met there, and even Rytlock has a polearm from there in his office. But hey, I guess it wasn't as important, so whatever, fuck the lore!
---
And to be fair, I'd rather play against monsters in a norn beast pit than in some mystical place were Svanir and a random jotun give bonus points.
---
What exactly is expected when someone offers a full home instance?
---
I have all home instance nodes, but grow ascended crops which visitors can't harvest and don't have the treasure chest.
---
Is that good enough to be shared?
---
And can the nodes only be harvested a certain amount of times per day (like 5 people can use them and then they disappear) or can the be harvested an unlimited amount of times?
---
Soloed both on ele before I started raiding and got good. This is a learn to play issue and nothing else.
---
Way more than that many people play raids, they just all have statics because pugging sucks
---
You enter the sub of an mmorpg and the first thing you ask is if you can play it alone? Why not play true single player games?
---
There will always be the doomsayers. At the very least, this game has got a whole season of content ahead, so about a year. And will likely continue on from that. Even if it doesn't, and it does enter maintenance mode, I highly doubt they'll switch it off; GW1 is still running even. 
---
To give you the longer version, a while back the dev team had a massive drop in staff (IIRC they went from ~400 to just under 300). Of course people panicked, but then it was revealed that this was due to cancelling/shelving unannounced non-GW2 products that were in production. This means the remaining team only had GW2 left to work on. This happened when the current season was already planned. Personally, I think if they were going for maintenance mode, with the "last" season already mostly planned, there would be no reason to keep anywhere near that much staff working on the game. To me, this suggest there's likely at least one more thing after the current season which they are working on right now (but who knows what that'll be, maybe another season or possibly an expansion, or maybe something else). 
---
You can also look at the financial side. Last time I checked, it's still pulling in money constantly, and has levelled out. Even though it's nowhere near the spike an expansion causes, it's a stable amount that's no longer dropping. I don't see why they'd shut that down, unless they predicted something better to replace it, but that can't be the case because they scrapped all new non-GW2 unannounced projects.
---
No, in pve there arent many bots and make a long while since I got a gold seller whisper.
---
Lol, what?
---
People are talking about that, but here is no indication from the company of maintenance mode.
---
Newbie here, when should I start inscription my gear? I'm a Level 15 Mesmer and I feel like I'm churning my equipment pretty quickly, so I've been saving my inscriptions in my bank.
---
No matter how much you trust them, if they aren't in anet page of official resellers, you are risking getting banned.
---
I heard that its a SP type of MMO that got me curious, also we dont have that many new games in this fantasy style, something that remind me of Dragon Age
---
Best part is the Pale tree was about to make some big public announcement at the world summit right before the shadow attacked, so she was probably about to spill the beans on her people's origin before it reached critical threat.
---
The entire Sylvari conspiracy was a clusterfuck of well intentioned cowardice.
---
¨player limit and shadows mostly XD
---
Well, sort of. In-game money, the stuff you earn and use in-game, is called gold. There's also a premium currency called gems, which you buy using real money. You can exchange gold for gems and vice versa, but only with other players (so there's an exchange rate that will vary with the game economy). Living world seasons can only be bought with gems, so if you want to use in-game money, you'll have to exchange your gold for gems. This might be doable for an endgame player, but as a new player, you'll likely be wanting to spend your gold on outfitting your characters, and will really struggle to afford all the living world episodes. 
---
So in all honesty, you'll probably need to buy them with real money. On the bright side, they're free if you log in while the latest episode is active, so you'll never need to buy future episodes.
---
Yea - 110% this - if anything happens to your game and it was bought by third party, you can only get help from the third party, not Anet. Buy direct from Anet.
---
