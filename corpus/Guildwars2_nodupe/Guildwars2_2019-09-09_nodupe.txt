Well, stealth is fine, permastealth, nope, no good, getting stomped from permastealth is terrible, unless ANet bothers to give more classes some reveal skills

it's not that bad tbh, the eye cancer, I mean, you get used to it, but not knowing that something is coming to wreck you is way worse

by playing with them. XD

It’s technically a trait, but Death from Above on Warrior. If youre defending a keep or tower in wvw from a blob that is using rams or close catas, jump on them from the walls. Then escape. Then jump on them again. Then escape. Then jump on them again. Love it.

How did Nico know when the shark attack happens to invuln it?
---
I don't understand why I wouldn't USE these things. My KP is my guild hall I guess :|
---
It's about lording your superiority over them, not helping them out.
---
Thank you what a champ.
---
You should make a post out of that picture, or not, you'll probably get more upvotes than me xD
---
anyone can fake kp.  
---
im ok with that as long as you carry your weight. some people are fast learners, doing it once or twice will get them up to speed. i faked my kp on cm fractals until i dont have to. its not a big deal.
---
There are literally never any 'no kp' or training runs that don't require you to join some guild that says they're a training guild but they just bring the same people each week and don't have room for you "but we hope blablahdude will have group 2 running next week" indefinitely. The only way you can get in is to be brought in by friends or guild members, the gatekeeping is so bad. 
---
"Well I did it and you can too!" is so disingenuous. What people actually mean by this is "I suffered through this shit and you should too!"
---
You could have stopped listening to him at necromancer who judges other people's builds
---
Of course people have reasons for being shitty people. That doesn’t make them any less shitty. If you are seriously trying to justify making someone feel like shit for no reason... then you are 100% the problem, and in my eyes, a troll.
---
I mean, it works for r/eve...

I've been playing for about a year and I'm just starting to really try to get into end game stuff. What is CM100?

---
That would mean whole episodes would be only cutscenes. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Origins_of_Madness_(living_world)
---
This one for example. If you make every open world part into cutscenes, there would be 2 instances left. Two instances that only contains dialogs. And I don't think a few core game like dialogs plus cutscenes are much better than the ingame video we already have. 
---
Same counts for the whole battle of lions arch and literally the whole season. Keep in mind that LS1 were completely different than LS2, 3 or 4. Most content *were* open world stuff. If you replace all open world sequences with cutscenes, you end up with a bunch of instanced with dialogs and 90% cutscenes.

Another garbage thing people use as an excuse to be garbage. This wouldn't happen so much in GW2 if the difference in DPS wasn't so gigantic and exponential. I experimented with meta builds vs changing a couple traits for survivability and my DPS dropped by a third. A noob in full Soldiers will be lucky to do 1/20th the DPS of the average dude following a meta build guide. 
---
That's why we keep getting various garbage as litmus test to let people into groups. Anet made the vast majority of gear/spec/trait/weapon choice just garbage in comparison to a meta build.
---
Uh, yes there absolutely is gatekeeping. Not once in 2 years of my time playing endgame content have I seen a single no kp training run, even in the several guilds I have been in, except for like, t1s-t2s.
---
Thank you so much! I’ll be patient and wait then.
---
Tysm!!
---
if you think so, then go ahead. but maybe you are the problem, thinking that everyone who is negative about something is a shitty person or a troll.  
---
there are also kids roaming arround the webs. imagine you had kids...would you want them to get the idea that a bad looking tattoo is a great thing because no one is negativ about it?  
---
people learn from mistakes...also from mistakes other people make. if you think its high value, go ahead, i am not gonna stop you. i do not have this opinion. i do not know if other value the same opinion. they can be negative about what i think if they want to....but thats not gonna stop be from not saying anything, especially if there is more on the line then just someone feeling bad.
---
I figured you knew about the continuing adventures of your doppelganger, but I ran across [who was responsible](https://twitter.com/StillNotSam/status/11692894015552266240)
---
And here I am, can't buy celestial infusion nor chaos combat tonic, because I need these stupid items to find groups.
---
There isn't, but you don't have to say anything. They're a new player, let them enjoy the existing content, they'll get there when they get there.
---
Don't be stupid. They're having fun with current content, I'm sure you did too when you were new, so leave them be, if they get to the point of dissatisfaction with no content like us then so be it, but for now they're enjoying it so just leave it be.
---
By seeing how they play. If you're a good player yourself, it isn't particularly difficult to see who's performing well and who's a pleb.
---
Then again this goes for any game in my opinion.
---
Exactly. There are definitely merits to finding a guild and doing a training run with experienced players because they already know the mechanics, but there's nothing stopping people from running in and trying it themselves. I mean, that's what all of the first raiders had to do in the first place to create the meta mechanics.
---
Daily Fractals encompasses both T4 dailies and CM dailies. Why? Because they're both content in fractals and reward you daily of course! People can of course do the T4s only or the CMs only too if they prefer.
---
&gt; it’s Arenanet’s fault that OP doesnt have balls big enough to admit their own mistake.
---
This thread is the OP admitting their mistakes where's Anet admitted their mistakes in including predatory monetisation practices.
---
Continuum Shift is the reason I play Mesmer

---
PUGs: LINK CURVE
---
Knowing how to play your class is much more important than knowing mechanics in general. If people are decent at their class (say, do more than 60% benchmark on a golem), mechanics are fairly easy to learn in just normal raids.
---
There are many raid training guilds that are really friendly.
---
&gt; why do you think you are entitled to special treatment?
---
Did I ever say that? Please quote that part, I don't remember. 
---
&gt; So why don't you start getting "these stupid items" just like all of us, by creating new group
---
Oh, right! There *IS* a special treatment you can get with all this KP insanity. Just start your own group and demand XYZ KP, because nobody will ask *you* for KP, if you start them. ;)
---
&gt; creating new group with lfg training or learning, we all had to start like this
---
I never said that I have to start. I said that I have to **keep** them, because I need them to find groups, so I **can't** spend them for an infusion or the tonic. 
---
Please explain me how training or learning groups can help me there...
---
Some people consider the cms as part of the entire fractal experience. Just because YOU consider fractals to be t4s and below only doesn't mean other people do. Yes the small guy can do t4 fractals but they might not consider that to be the full fractal experience.
---
It doesn't matter if CM is part of the entire Fractal experience. KP is localized entirely on CM groups. You don't need KP for 1-100. 
---
All CM is part of Fractals but not all Fractals are CM.
---
Both! Fastest way. Use the gold from fractals to get up to 500 in crafting!
---
Options &gt; Automatically expand LFG preview
---
We have to see the balance. Chances are it's a 10 man bounty, and not even legendary, so that *everyone* can do it.
---
Just put a bug report in that the npc bugs out and rewards free gold. 
---
Fixed next day.
---
Wasting time on old story content is the last thing Anet should do at the moment.
---
i basically think it'll be around freezie 1.5, the important part is that it wont teach players how to play the game with things such as class diversity, boons, etcs. Itll prob just be a boss fight with various mechanics with very low dps benchmarks for success since its supposed to be accomplish with 10 random open world builds/classes
---
Which is weird when most raid bosses in gw2 are easier than Heroics in WoW. The barrier of entry is so low that most of the rejection comes more from the stigma of the word "raids" and the gatekeeping from the community than anything else.
---
It just needs for detail and time put into it, definitely salvageable if OP wants to change any of it. The bashing and negative comments aren’t really necessary... but this is reddit after all.
---
No one wants to put in the work of being "in charge" of a raid and organizing people. They just want to show up and be told what to do. I know this because I've experienced it myself in my guild. We have a dedicated team led by me and we've been raiding no problem for years. Another raid team is definitely possible but I do not have the time to lead another. People want to raid, but no one wants to be the one to figure out what day and time would work out of the week for 9 others. So, those people just wait around hoping for a chance to jump into Team 1 to do the occasional cover for. I'm seeing these same people in the comments. 
---
If you want to do it badly enough, you'll take the initiative, just like I and thousands of others did.
---
I posted mine on reddit before... and someone even made an article about it on comic book.com because it was controversial lol (just a DBZ character in the shape of an ice cream cone). I def learned not to share tattoos on reddit haha.
---
They have never said it can't they have said it would take a lot of work and to be fair its a years worth of content.
---
what do you mean? flamethrower is fantastic for condi engi! Just cause it's not good on power doesn't make it a shit skill..
---
Thanks
---
I would be so down for some sort of player mechanics training thing. Like yeah, you can be great at playing your class and doing your rotation, but stuff like orbs at KC or greens on Dhuum are such a pain starting out. Training raids are ok, but often either the group struggles so much with fight mechanics that you never get to do your thing, or everyone's there to practice a new class and you get the kill in 2 pulls.
---
Yes.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unstable_Cosmic_Essence
---
&gt; The trick to avoid all of these things ofc is to run with an experienced squad. People still run dungeons nowadays, they just do it on discords with friends rather than lfg.
---
or just murder everything since it's pretty quick to melt most groups anyway
---
Yeah but where is your issue with the post? The post says fractal lfg and you will see cm groups in the t4 section of the lfg.
---
Definitely agree.
---
I found I could train groups on those mechanics, difficult as they are. It might take 4+ runs for them to get it, but they could learn on the spot.
---
It was however much more difficult if they players weren't across damage and CC rotations. I could give some coaching, but learning that stuff doesn't need to be done in a live environment, and is much more difficult to learn when you are also trying to dodge orbs and lasers and tigers oh my.
---
The fact that you say everyone who doesn't follow your casual party/squad ideology should be banned is the most toxic thing I've seen tbh.
---
People should be allowed to play how they want, just make your casual/training/ open minded lfgs and enjoy the game how you like it.
---
Most of the time it's fine and if you kill the boss smoothly then no one should really be bothered but I have definitely seen my fair share of fake kp guys and groups where people apparently meet the requirements but don't play particularly well. In any case it's not difficult to see who knows what they're doing and who doesn't and most of the time you end up spotting it naturally during the fight anyway.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted.  I think we all owe a degree of thanks to people that champion positive QoL changes to the game.
---
Sweet, I'll definitely check that out! Thanks a lot! :D
---
This *was* my favorite skill ever until it was axed in september 2014. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01rFSyQOqKM
---
Phased NPCs and objects is a tech added in S3, not S4.
---
It's not a good idea to abuse it, since it doesn't work well when playing with other players in other stages of the story.
---
I think one of the major concerns ArenaNet has expressed about investing time into making Season 1 playable again is that they don't think enough people are interested in playing old content.  I can only hope that the interest that World of Warcraft Classic has generated gives them cause to reconsider that.
---
Also there's no reason for them to reintroduce it all in one go, they could release an episode at a time and then put it on the gemstore for those that either don't have accounts that existed at the time, or that don't login when the chapter is live - like they do with existing Living Story episodes.  That way the work is also financially compensated for into the future.
---
They could even take the opportunity to fix or revise/rewrite parts of the story/mechanics they felt were weak at the time, or that could benefit from newer game engine functionality.  I'm sure this would create a lot more interest from those who played it back when it was originally released.

Max out bank tabs, max out material storage, make at least 20 alts as mules (use at least 20 slot invis bags, use bag slot expansions when needed for even more storage space). Organize. Organize. Organize. Keep a list of who generally carries what (armor, weapons, accessories, etc.) or use GW2 Efficiency to find your crap. :D

This is actually how I ended up learning how to do T4 Fractals and certain raid bosses. My friend legit just got another friend group of his to carry my heavy self while teaching me the ropes. For weeks. For *months.* 
---
Nowadays I just automatically switch weapons, utilities, and my build to match whatever boss we're on without thinking!
---
Do fractals at the highest tier you can manage; you will build up gold and relics, and maybe you will get lucky with chest drops. Get your backpack, rings, amulet, trinkets, and weapons from collections/living world map vendors - these can start holding agony infusions to take you to higher tiers which will get you better loot. If you do any collections for asc armor boxes, choose chestpiece and legs first as they are the most expensive to make and the least likely to drop as a fractal chest. 
---
You should still level up crafting, as there is a way to use fractals to get exactly the ascended gear you want, at a discount: Grandmaster Marks. These are crafted tokens that use the same mats as ascended gear, but less of those mats.
---
Been there man. It's ridiculous!

This isnt at all like wow. There's multiple avenues to easily get your gear up to snuff. (Mythic 10 dungeons drop heroic raid equivelant loot)
---
What this comes from is Guild Wars 1 Elite content. Where you had to show proof of completion through crafting materials which dropped in the instance. (which can also be traded among players) this would cause people who are new to content to be locked out.  Even tho it only takes 1 or 2 runs to get it down.

New updates for wow probably as last I played was cataclysm and they had just released raid finder. GW1 however never gave me problems getting into endgame sections

By playing with other inexperienced people. You're effectively saying that experienced players should be obligated to carry inexperienced players

ORANGE MAN BAD AM I RIGHT GUYS XD

actually no.  the burden is upon the person who states the positive claim.  so its you who have to link it.

wow is 15 years old but has continually been updated. =)
---
Kp is not a perfect system. If someone joins my squad and links their kp too fast, I'm inclined to suspect they're copy pasting code.
---
Soon becomes obvious after one or two pulls anyways.
---
I have a book storage alt firebrand named Writlock Bookstore.
---
I think this is why Strikes are exactly perfect. Because they're not REALLY aiming to teach players encounters. I think it will teach some basics (greens, split phases, break bars) but it will primarily be there as a place for new players to form groups with other new players. New and veteran players all groups up to take on a strike and the new players find one or two players who are friendly an help them learn. Then they team up and pug the remaining members. The next strike, those player find another player that jives with them, etc. This snowballs, ideally, until they have a pseudo-static. They all now have:
---
1. A baseline of knowledge/skill
---
2. A roughly similar time when they're available to play
---
3. Positive experiences in 10-man content
---
4. Emotional investment in the group
---
In an ideal scenario, this group now seamlessly transitions into raids and either learns the encounters via youtube or via experimentation. Obviously this might not happen, but I can see the rationale ANet's likely going for and I think it's much better than easy mode raids. The basic understanding of most raid mechanics (that are TERRIBLY tutorialized like everything else in the game) means players will not be do easily confused  when they enter encounters. The similar time will mean they will naturally be able to play together and support each other (maybe not the full 10 but a majority). The positive experiences will lead them to not see raids as scary. And the emotional investment will lessen the likelihood of flaming and rage. Think about it. Your Chrono player just got hit by a blue in VG and caused a wipe. If he's a rando in a pug LFG today, a lot of players would chew him out. But are you really going to go into his mother's sexual life with him when you've fought with him in the Bangar Ruinbringer strike mission where he pulled off that clutch res that saved your group? Fuck no.
---
With regards to easymode, I think that has a lot of potential downsides. For one, "easy mode" would probably be laughed at by the so-called hardcore community, with "go back to easy mode" probably becoming the go-to insult when anyone disappoints in any way conceivable. Second, easy mode brings a huge number of logistical concerns. What are rewards like there? ARE there rewards? Is there now also a Hard Mode? Personally, I don't mind these sorts of systems, but I can see where people might have some problems, and if you honestly think there's a simple, elegant solution to all of these, then you need to get your head examined-- this is a minefield. And finally, it runs the risk of never being used by a playerbase which has immediately written off raids, even easymode raids, as something they'll never get into. Whether thanks to a shit experience or a perception that they're too hard, a lot of people will see the word raid and turn the other direction. Calling these Strike Missions rather than Raid Tutorials means you get people to dip their toe in and see that it's not that bad.

Why would you run ps warrior in open world last i remember it wasn't even a thing in raids anymore
---
The difference in DPS is supposed to be this way. Breke has the better rotation burst wise and how the phases line up.
---
i want the ability to use water weapons in land.
---
So most dungeons including story are designed to be group content, but you can do most of them without a full party - it's just slightly harder.
---
Zhaitan (Arah story mode) is the only exception to this rule, and is often played as a single player content. This is primarily because story pays less than explorable, and this particular story is both easy to solo And much longer than an explorable path. So there's little reason to spend time looking for players to do Arah story.
---
Hammer ranger, just because I want to put Sharur on my Orr-themed ranger toon.
---
Warrior with focus or staff and a monk vibe (mantras?) would be cool.
---
Very simple: By playing with people who also have less experience.
---
You have to remember that some of these players did these fractals/raids more than 100+ times (or even more) and you expect them to play with people who are new or inexperienced?
---
While a "mixed group" can certainly complete the content in a timely fashion there is still a huge difference compared to a "good group". As someone who joined 250+ KP groups and 25+ KP groups for fractals (for a few months) I can tell you that there was a noticable difference. Obviously not every 250+ KP group was perfect but these runs were on average much more stable and faster. And if you do something every day and you can choose between a 45 minute run or a 60+ minute run you are going to choose the faster ones after a while.
---
Or in other words: KP groups simply work and if you don't have KPs play with other players who don't have KPs (or who don't require them).
---
you can tell devs what to do. =)  its what your entitled to as a player.
---
TL;DR: Balancing has been and always will be one of the main banes of Anet's existence, and I don't even mean this maliciously. The proof is pretty obvious in every game mode.
---
&gt;Long have the developers claimed LS1 could not be remade due to some of its content taking place in open world.
---
Eh, you're misrepresenting the situation a little here. They didn't say it couldn't be *remade*, but that it couldn't just be brought back in a trivial manner. A remake has always been *possible*, just not *feasible*. Suspending the game's content pipeline in order to rehash old content would not be a popular or beneficial move for the game.
---
can you work for anet pls
---
A healing/support Thief with Focus offhand would be interesting.
---
Scepter + Focus for Rev, Vizier Khilbron for legend
---
Yeah basically, but I think this mega thread has only helped Anet stay silent. It's another disgraceful example of the mods here acting out of step.
---
In that sort of a situation it's usually BYOB (Bring Your Own Boons) or accept that you'll have none.  *Shrug*.  99% of the people that try to learn CMs are incapable of playing support so that's what I ended up playing -- Chrono, Druid, Renegade, Firebrand (etc).
---
Stop playing healbrand btw :D
---
The problem is that pugging is a revolving door of progression into regression. You have some people who show up prepared mixed with people who are wholly unprepared, time is wasted, the prepared and unprepared people get frustrated and leave to be replaced, and then you're back to square one of progression with fresh new people introducing brand new mistakes to work over.
---
I really can't stress that the real problem with the raiding community is the sheer lack of statics wanting to train permanent members.  The best way to learn is in a static group of committed people with similar goals of effort and time investment.
---
PuGs are NOT and will never be a good model for learning.
---
But most raiding guilds you see in the GW2 recruitment all ask for 2+ clears of the wings before even trialing you, and especially if you want to learn the CM raids, the guilds that do get CM clears are a very small pool of people willing to teach.
---
When you have a raiding community that is not willing to take in new players to be mentored in statics, you have a dying raid community. It doesn't mean you have to carry players who are not putting the effort to improve and wasting your time, but players have to be allowed the opportunity to grow into competence.
---
Most raid academies ultimately fail because a person is stuck cycling through learning groups composed for different people every session, and every session is foiled by having a disparate group of differently prepared and progressed members clashing.
---
1h sword for necro, purely for aesthetic reasons. I don't even care what utility the spec would have, just give me a rapier
---
Glyph of Renewal. Its longer cast time really makes you feel like you're tracing it mid air and, especially in earth when you can pull up 3 NPCs at a time, it really feels impactful. Pity it can't put defeated players in a downed state or something.
---
We call it the shark attack. Its his ''overhead smash line into projectile attack'' he does 3 times in a row.   
---
You cast the signets as soon as he starts to move his hands down to attack.
---
The marionette had 5 lanes. 
---
Since it'll become a hardcore world boss, the scaling would be steep.  Not as step as the 50-60 people needed for Triple trouble, but not as few as 10 either.   
---
I'd go with requiring at least 5 people in each of the lanes to get it done comfortably. 
---
And since it'll be in a separate shared instance like [Mists Rfits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mists_Rift_\(area\)), it can have a different player cap than Lornar's pass. So the instance can be changed to force exactly 25, or allow over 100.   
---
That also means it doesn't have to have enabled gliding and mounts, so that's also two less things to worry about. 
---
Being a Hardcore world boss, it would also be possible to start it on demand with a [Guild World Event](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_World_Event) consumable when the time isn't close to the scheduled event.

Thanks :)

Active effect gives resistance and cuts by half the remaining duration of all conditions except vulnerability and DPS conditions on self. On enemies it deals damage and removes and seals Aegis, Stability, Resistance and Protection.  
---
 * Judge with a 2h Axe. Also jury and an executioner. Judgement utilities punish enemy actions, making them take damage when they heal other allies, when they give or recive boons, etc. Burning done by the Judge becomes a new "Mistfire" condition that deals more damage the more boons the target has. 
---
* Revenant
---
 * A scepter with a Legendary Spirit Legend: [Togo](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/127694/#Comment_127694).
---
 * A Greatsword with a Legendary Tengu Legend: Talon Silverwing. 
---
 * Also new weapon for core revenant: a ranged main hand weapon like a throwing dagger and axe, or a pistol, with a condition damage focus, so core revenant can have 2 ranged weapons and 2 condition weapons. 
---
* Engineer
---
 * Warhorn and a Sound Engineer or Roadie (going with the Metal band theme we got in S5) that summons indestructible Loudspeakers that give pulsing buffs, like warrior banners. 
---
 * A main hand shield used as a thrown weapon like a Disc from Tron. 
---
 * And of course a mace for core engineer. 
---
* Ranger:
---
 * A hammer. And one of the skills must be called "Thump" and have an animation showing a spirit bunny jumping on he enemy to knock them down. 
---
* Thief
---
 * Dual torches for a Juggler elite that juggles everything. Stolen skills, boons, conditions, enemies, allies...
---
 * Also an offhand sword for core thief. 
---
* Elementalist:
---
 * A rifle or pistols. Attunements and weapon skills become charges. Rifle can load up charges and fire several charges together. Different combination of charges create different spells when fired as bullets. 
---
 * Offhand scepter. Offhand scepter skills create growing elemental pillars that block projectiles and bodyblock enemies. When fully grown, the pillars can be toppled by the elemetalist to hurt enemies and leave AoE fields behind. 
---
* Mesmer
---
 * 2h axe held like a guitar for a Banshee metal-themed mesmer that debuffs and demoralizes enemies with shouts and chants (as opposed to a buffing minstrel). 
---
* Necromancer.
---
 * Dual pistols that fire screaming souls at enemies for a Souls Reaver. The souls from autoattacks stack on the enemy and circle around them dealing damage for a while, then return to the necromancer with life force. The other pistol skills fire shadows that use life force as ammo.
---
     * Instead a Shroud, the life force bar becomes ammo for skills that empower weapon attacks. 
---
 * A hammer for a Wraith specialization that Commands allieswith an autoattack that leaves a mark on the 3rd strike. The mark will steal life. When the hammer trait is equipped, the mark also summons a minion that steals life from enemies and heals allies with the stolen life when it dies. 
---
 * A sword with a Vampiric specialization with a blood-letting theme and bleeding in all of its skills.
---

Hey thank you, i will ad some thing to the tattoo like flowers. I love your tattoo
---
They did say that they lost a significant part of the assets, including most of old Lion's Arch.
---
You can't store assets in a version control system as easily as you can store text files like code.
---
I want a rifle for my ranger, go all big game hunter. Also scepter for my warrior, but that's just because theres one in particular that would look amazing on my warrior.
---
I was so hoping for this i want to use Spears damit
---
Its not like its going to be disabled forever..
---
And every bleeding edge raider got refused to a curve heroic group once or twice too...
---
no, stop with the LSD please.
---
i just want a polearm spec to use on land. idc if it's warrior, guardian, revenant, ranger or whatever. they can even just repurpose the underwater spears and tridents for all i care. it can't be much more complicated than letting renegade and daredevil use staff for melee combat instead of spell-casting.
---
I mean Anet has no interest in people not raiding because the community are elitist jerks.
---
In fact raiders should have an interest in making sure every player that ever wanted to try raids got babysited as much as possible to become a raider.
---
If too few people play raids, they will get dungeon'd sooner or later.
---
So elitist raiders are really just killing their own content.
---
Guardian could get off hand mace or off hand sword. No clue what flavour that'd be though.
---
Revenant I had a concept of doing Twin legends but if the weapons rule is followed then I think Rev is a prime candidate for Scepter being one of the few other classes that can reasonably wield a scepter albeit it might be too close to Mace.
---
Hard agree on mesmer hammer and hammer needs more representation.
---
Necro pistol could be interesting but necro lacks a good beat stick to compliment.
---
He is right though, if the elitists drive away people from raiding and raiding as a whole remains a niche activity, Anet will reduce the ressources invested into new raids eventually.
---
It's a step deeper than that though. Anet are perfectly good at understanding WHAT the problem is, but they have no understanding WHY the problem exists, because they don't do their due diligence.
---
Scrapper is a great example, but here is more proof:
---
The druid nerfs over the years have mostly been in response to their capability to sustain. They could kite indefinitely with staff, being able to dash away with staff 3, projectile destroy using staff 5 and apply pressure while recharging can extremely fast with staff 1. Nerfs to staff 3 were confusing because they were clearly targetted at reducing a druids capability to kite and reset, but staff 3 wasn't the issue. The biggest problem with the druid kit all along was staff 1. That single skill can animate through walls giving target locations, heals yourself and allies, builds CA disgustingly fast, applies pressure to ranged targets, is ranged non-projectile damage so very hard to counter, has 1200 unit range with instant damage and it's damage distribution just makes it perfect for deleting aegis. Combined with a high damage pet which you can heal, made a druid a bitch of a class to fight in pvp. The same sentiment was felt in PvE and still is with the ongoing meme of staff girlfriend druids who go 1111111111111.
---
TLDR they should have nerfed staff 1 at least by removing it's healing, but they nerfed literally everything else instead making the class bland and boring.
---
The same happened with the thief changes to shadow arts recently. The problem is that stealth is 100% NOT a defensive tool in gw2. And as long as revealed exists it never will be. The problem is that shadow arts is useless, and that's the reason. Once again they tried addressing the problem without addressing why it's a problem, so instead of doing literally anything that plays nice with stealth (give invulnerability to reveal, move revealed training to SA or even just a trait that gives offensive boons whenever you grant stealth). They instead chose to double down on the defensive aspects of SA by adding more healing traits. Which imo thief needs, but it's just straight up the wrong place for it.
---
You know you don't have to spam it, right? In down state you can hit 4 once and it'll continue to slowly revive you.
---
They have fixed most of the stuff. I usually play with afterburner and discord overlay and after the last updates it doesnt crash.
---
You could totally defeat scarlet without doing the meta, they added a backdoor to the instance.
---
a tattoo is the same as a kid? oh okay.  
---
remember to not post your kids on the internet guys.
---
Just like in GW2
---
"Make your own group daily", that's like waiting 1h for a group that leaves if the first try wipes on the 1st boss. Wouldn't recommend it.
---
I second this, but I'd prefer shortbow with faster pewpew.
---
1. Warrior hammer primal burst skill (nobody knows about this one but man is it a great feeling skill)
---
2. Gravity Well
---
3. Unrelenting Assault
---
4. Revenant hammer 3
---
5. Shiro Elite
---
6. Reaper of Grenth (human elite)
---
7. Basically every Holo skill
---
8. Reaper 5
---
Excellent post. I wish I could give you all the upvotes so more people read this and maybe learn something.
---
You should try Revenant.
---
Lmao
---
I need a friend like this to teach me the ways yet here I am looking at YouTube videos dumbfounded lol I'll figure it out one day
---
I had the same ''issue'' in GW1. I had 900+ gold, and just as i was about to get to 1000gold, instead I lose it all and get 1 platinum. I felt sad, even though nothing bad happened x).
---
And just to be clear, in GW1 a 1000gold was 1 platinum, it was a normal currency but i had no idea.
---
Sadly it is a human phenomena that exists in the real world also.
---
I think newbs can handle two places to look at.
---
Strengthening their idea of playing another raider however is a genuine issue. But then again, Anet implemented actual fucking raids. So yeah...
---
Anet and their fans like to pretend this game has no traditional questing and that its somehow better. This is obviously not true but the fasade is strong.
---
So what?
---
**Proceeds to slap Humility dye on every slot**
---
I mean, I wanted to gear up my fresh MNK alt that I'd just gotten in goetia gear with a weapon and accessories, and I couldn't get him into anything because everything was i445 or i450. I'd already capped on Alexander for the week, and the only other alternative is crafted gear which is heavy on gil. It's not like everybody does everything only with their main.
---
Maybe, but it's still annoying to shift through all the crap when you want to look at the collection again. Especially annoying on the 'collections of collections' where you need to go back and forth.
---
Sure, you can always pin it to be able to go back faster but that's kind of using a feature meant for another thing to fix what's broken in another.
---
I'd rather just have a completely separated tab called "Quests" that also draws attention to the fact they're not just your run of the mill 'achievements'.
---
Should've called it Fate's Razor
---
Staff 3 definitivly needed a nerv as well but rather range or cd than the dodge. Further I'd would have nerved pet dmg. Effectivly a ranger only had to focus on surviving  and the pet did the rest. I always dislike it alot when ai does your job. It was the same problem with turret engi. 
---
Removing the heal on staff would have been quite a problem in pve. Im all for splitting skills numbers wise I would dislike a split function wise.
---
[Discretize](https://discretize.eu/builds) is a a very good source but may not be fully up-to-date for minor tweaks.
---
Here is my experience on great fractal classes (everything is assumed to be a Power DPS unless stated otherwise):
---
* DH, very easy, very good burst, reliable, flexible (can take stab, reflect, additional CC, etc) and nice sustain
---
* Soulbeast, sky-high short burst, can bring Frost Spirit or a bit more CC at almost no cost
---
* Weaver (sword), high burst, high sustained DPS, very squishy so I would usually recommend DH over Weaver unless you already know very well how to play Weaver (and until you master Fractals a bit better)
---
* Berserker Banner, can almost deal as much damage as an actual DPS while also taking banners, good CC, can swap Core War when you *really really* need a lot of CC
---
* Divinier Renegade, provides Alacrity, some might, some Stab, can boon-rip if necessary, boosts groups Ferocity as well as general damage with Kalla's Elite and has absurd CC
---
* Heal Firebrand (recommended imo for most non ultra-experienced groups), provides Quickness, most of the Might, has good passive heal with easy access to burst heal, can also be flexible and take some stab/reflect/additional CC, plenty of Aegis and other defensive boons to share around
---
This is not to say other DPS classes or support combo are necessarily bad (although it is usually a bit of a pain to need to go back to Chrono + Druid) but if you go with any of those you will be good.
---
In fractals phalanx strenght trait is meta and If you're running without a Druid or Renegade, you need to provide  Might (and  Fury to some degree) for the party- https://discretize.eu/builds/warrior/banner-warrior

Hammer ranger + blink, please and thank you!
---
Yeah but the scaling effect differs... Some games are quite fun as it is even playing solo, so plying with friends might not make the increase in fun too significant, while some games (like gw2) could be quite boring by themselves, while becomes drastically different if playing with friends.
---
He just could have say “Good Luck” and open his own LFG. Joining to a group and trying to kick people is rude.
---
Right click?
---
Does Shift+Right-Click works on all links in the game?
---
I play games to get away from the reality of "you don't have enough experience for this job"...
---
I think you've met some different newbs from I have. Just rename the achievement's panel Quests and Achievements and you have a way to go. But again, how to you determine which is which? Split up collections, some of which are quests. Collections are already split by area you're working on in the living story. Collections from the new living stories aren't usually in the collection tab, even if they're just collections. 
---
It would probably require more work than it's worth. Maybe it will improve the game for some people and not improve the game for a whole bunch of other people. It's useable now in the way it is. Asking Anet to go through everything in the achievement panel, seperate out the quests, and make a quest log for  those, in my mind, is asking for trouble.  I'd rather have more work done on the panel itself, or have a suggestion system that suggests certain achievements.
---
Again, I use the achievement panel as a quest long and when I teach the game, which I do often, that's one of the things I stress.  As with many things in this game, the game does a poor job of informing new players.  But the idea of a quest log turns this more into a linear go here do this type of game, and that is a major shot at the game itself. It's just something that I think would make this game very different, and not necessarily in a good way.
---
Tbh they shouldn't have added any of the in-between components that you would only craft when using. I get that a few people wanted them... But they were and still are dumb.
---
I like the achievements system better. It could definitely use a little cleanup but I prefer to go by an achievement list than hunt down yellow exclamation points in open world then return to the yellow question marks.
---
YMMV :)
---
You mean, when people post them in chat?  No, sorry.  That would be nice.
---
&gt;There's still so much groups at 250 KP running with a healbrand, what I can't understand tbh.
---
That is because by this point there are plenty of people who accumulated decent amount of kp by just slowly and safely farming 100cm on wheelchair setups and without any willingness to improve past that. It was out for 700+ days, after all, you can do it just on weekends and still have a solid kp count. 
---
Normally we would have some new content to reset the situation and give a way to separate more ambitious players who would stay on the edge, but with the way game is going, I only expect situation to devolve further.
---
There is /cheer emote. It is cute for female human tho.
---
Exactly people just want to be carried instead of actually learning and playing the game.
---
Achievements are all sorted in categories, torning them apart wouldn't "de-clutter", it just would confuse because achievements wouldn't be in their categories. Therefore you would get a new window, which is basically the same, with all the other achievements for no reason.
---
It would only confuse and wouldn't help at all.
---
just link fake achievement, ez
---
So then you shouldn't have any problems with making your own group? Or are you actually just wanting to be carried through the content by better players?
---
100CM has been a thing for quite a while now so...
---
Only because some tasks are similar, doesn't mean it's a traditional quest.
---
No matter what the task is, you will never have the traditional "talk to this NPC to get a quest" nor "talk to that NPC to complete the quest" nor "you need to be lvl XY to accept this quest" nor "your lvl is too high, you won't get any exp from this quest".
---
Find friends instead, a guild. Show them you’re competent and they’ll play with you.
---
Usually my boyfriend is the one who helps me get into raids (before, now I have enough LI and experience) but he didn’t do fractals so I have been way too scared to try to join anything. Endgame can be brutal sometimes.
---
by not hoarding trash  
---
i only have 3 bank tabs and they're enough for me, stuff like ascended boxes or stat selectable exotic gear for meme builds i keep on 2 bank alts
---
Funny, I only play weaver on 99/100.
---
Wasn't this posted few months ago?
---
I really think they should give use spear and trident use in land too before new specs. They already got the skins and resources. Why not ? making the spear one handed and trident two handed
---
There are still MANY groups that don't ask for essence.
---
You can always make your own group.
---
If you're confident and checked mechanics/vids beforehand you can join a 10-20ess group and explain your situation.
---
&gt; I must admit that kp requirements got quite unresonable recently.
---
Nevermind how stupid they were to begin with since for most of them it's something you're supposed to use up again. Usually a currency. So you need to keep them to have enough to show to others.
---
I call this " The human bot program " .
---
Throwing the responsibility onto the people who are being excluded from the system isn't really a great take. It's a very 'Why don't the poor just work harder?' thoughtless shit take.
---
Because people have skills and knowledges that they're personally comfortable with sharing and also may not be related to the problem they're currently trying to solve. That's why. I don't have leadership qualities, I don't have the confidence to run the content, nor do I wish to bother learning any of it until I know I can get my foot in the door because I'm probably going to forget it all if I learn it now and actually get in my first pug raid 6 months down the road when the raiding community maybe realises they fucked up in slowly bleeding their playerbase dry and try to act like they weren't being jerks this whole time?
---
New mechanic added to the game, if you spam positive messages in chat your might cap increases to 50 and you are invulnerable for 1 min per message.
---
You mean the broken perma stealth build? Yeh op, please don’t listen to this guys advice
---
So glad I don't do endgame and just do casual openworld stuff. x3
---
Banish is best. Especially combined with Judge's Intervention. Giving people the cliff dive of their life has never been more fun.
---
Exactly, while this problem was once common in FF14 and WoW and all other such MMORPGs, usually by now they 'solved' it via providing:
---
* Multiple avenues for "similar" gear, usually you can do some ultra-trivial version of raids or tougher version of dungeons to get gear either comparable or just marginally worse than the main raid gear.
---
* Once a successive tier of difficulty is added, previous gear is intentionally made available for trivial efforts.
---
I don't think the technology is there yet .
---
Except there is, apart from good things traditional quests bring.
---
Yeah I think I misinterpreted what you meant, my bad.
---
But the kp doesn't instantly tell you if a person is good. It instantly tells you how much kp they have and that they might be good. So the only way to really know if they are good is to see them in action and like I said most of the time if the run is smooth then no one will have any problem anyway.
---
Hmmmm. Third day, third day... The low hanging fruit would be a Jesus joke with PoF's ur ded part of the story. But I know that's not it. It's also not Aurene's death since she lies there un-pierced. Braham's there, so...Eir? Unlikely, that's *really* old content.
---
For some reason I read the one line as "My friend with 41k HP" and laughed my freaking ass off xD
---
What
---
If everyone had friends or a guild to play fractals, nobody would use LFG.
---
That’s not true. I almost always played with friends AND pugs. Most decent fractal and raid groups do have a base of people that know eachother. 10 randoms in raids is usually a fiesta.
---
1.When doing map completion, you can check your progress by opening the map (default keybind "M"), and zoom out a bit. If you hover your mouse over the name of a map, it will display of many hearts, pois, vistas and hero challenges you've completed out of the total in that map. Also, when you open the map, on the top left corner you can see the percentage and total amount of things you've discovered around the maps of Core Tyria.
---
2.There's an achievement for exploring areas of different areas of Tyria in the [Explorer achievement panel](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Explorer). In the [Hero](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_(achievements\)) panel there's one for completing events up to 5000, but it doesn't matter which ones or if you repeat the same ones.
---
3.Some events start on a fixed timer, some after a certain amount of time has passed since its last completion, or if there's a minimum amount of players in the area.
---
It's not playstyle, and it's literally the highest gear you could get when the trials first came out, aside from what the trials dropped themselves. I've done the trials repeatedly as many different jobs and roles and have NEVER had issues, it's usually other people dying.
---
Maybe don't remove all waypoints, but remove some of them. Not all of them are necessary. New players don't have mounts, let them travel quickly.
---
World bosses are not super rewarding (exept those with chance of asc loot). The problem is everything you get as a common reward, will be cheap and almost worthless soon. *Someone had an idea of WB currency* and skins (or other items, boxes, maybe ingrediens) that could be bought for this currency/tokens.
---
World bosses don't have any mechanics (exept Triple Trouble and Jormag). Rest of them can be just out-dps. For now WBs are only DPS golems. They should be like true meta events. Sadly we won't get any changes here. Anet doesn't want to change old content.
---
I would like to see core maps more interesting and more populated. I think they're great maps, but... empty. HoT or PoF maps are also not popular if we speak about regular events. Only metas and bounties.
---
I think hearts are more likely the traditional quest but doesn't work like it.
---
However, I prefer achievement than quests. Main reason is that I don't need to run all the way to some npc back and forth, and check what quest I should get before going where or when(though there is a few locked achievements). I agree with visual clutter but that's something to do with UI and categorising. Able to filter achieves whether it gives you title or gear or just points would be nice.
---
The next set should fill up the "holes" in classes and at the same time, make some of the underused weapons more appealing..
---
I don't have a proper main anymore, even if i started Gw2 with Warrior and GW1 with an assassin i replicated here, so those are the ones i use the most, but got everything.
---
Probably it's very stupid, but this is my take on that:
---
- Warrior: need a proper support traitline, shorbow may be used as a mid\long range healing weapon
---
- Guardian: since actually firebrand should be support more than anything else, i'd see a condi spec coming, shortbow may fit too, but i'd say dagger mainhand [and maybe offhand too, torch is so overused i'd like to see another condi offhand]
---
- Revenant: while it may be good with other specs as power builds, it doesnt peak, so we could actually use a power oriented specialization, i'd say GS, and i'd say Jora or Svanir
---
- Mesmer: This is tough.. it performs well on any role, so it may be a "just for fun" specialization with pistol in main hand or hammer
---
- Elementalist: mmm.. Rifle maybe? a ranged single target spike dps with a lot of fields and combos, it wouldnt be bad
---
- Necro: i'd take Desmina as an hint and say hammer, the class may benefit a nice ranged weapon tho, or maybe axe offhand if it make some change on axe mainhand while dualwielding
---
- Ranger: i'd say scepter or shield.. no clue about how it could work
---
- Engi: while staff may contribute to a nice support build, and we definitely needs a support build now that scrapper is mostly a [not]tank setup, i'd say dual axe or dual mace.
---
- Thief: Tough one too, GS stanceshare or GS shout would be awesome, but i think we'll get something like sword offhand with some tweaks on dual wielding option to boost D\D and P\P as well.
---
Mesmer portal singlehandedly got me interested in the game. It’s bread and butter for GW2 players, but it’s such an iconic skill that doesn’t exist in the same way in any other game. I love how immersive it is since levels, terrain, and JPs are such a big part of the game.
---
Continuum Split and the whole undiluted Alacrity (when it was 66% CDR and still a buff) mechanic blew my mind when HoT came out. It was so much fun to be a freshly minted Chrono.
---
Well, I heard that over few last days, there is a lot of DDoS attacks around at main services around the world. (for example: https://old.reddit.com/r/security/comments/d0v8kz/wikipedia_is_currently_under_a_ddos_attack_and/ )
---
As GW2 servers use Amazon distributed servers, those attacks can definitely affect the game as well, even if not targetted directly. Many other main services use Amazon or Google networks. When some server gets attacked, distributed servers try to rebalance the traffic and that moment you can get ping spike. Matches with your observed time period as well.
---
I actually wonder what happens if you phase before the last ball lands lol but missing extra damage modifiers would be pretty bad still
---
No, it is because someone is DDoSing main services around the world in last few days, and GW2 uses Amazon servers, lag spike happens when servers try to reroute traffic.
---
well there are a lot of training groups and guilds for that case. so if you really want to get started with raiding you can, even with 0 kp and 0 li
---
That is very nice of 400kp person.
---
But then you'd never want a rev in your party cos they'd just be running off and getting themselves killed!
---
I hope for hammer on ranger, so I can be a bunnythumper again!
---
Absolutely not, kp's came out over 2 years ago and people want them only for fractal 100 challenge mode, besides if they haven't bothered you since relese, that means they won't be a problem for you now.
---
You say about mystic clovers, but you forget about mystic coins. These are real problem, because you can obtain mystic coins only from login rewards (20 per month) and you can loot them in CM fractals. Any other good sources?
---
I didn't have any problems with mystic clovers. We can buy them from fractal vendors and gamble them in MF (but there's a high chance to get a Mystic Clover).
---
Unreasonable is that gold sink for Mystic/Ice Runestones (100, 1g each). I think they should be looted e.g. from chest after Claw of Jormag or other WBs/champions.
---
the "entrance" barrier is partly self made. i also startet "late". People where asking for the huge amount of 70(!!!!) LI when i started raiding. obviously i had to form a newbie raid group, and i would´t not have missed that pain/fun.
---
i see where you are coming from, but what you do not like about raids is what raids make "interessing". the possibility to fail and "waist time". it was always advertized as niche content but long release windows made it even more so.
---
do you play fractal t4/cm? how was the transition from normal to cm? do you think what you learned in t1 helped you in t4? would watching a youtube video tought you as much?
---
Imagine a "saga" with hearts and achievements. Now imagine it with proper interesting quests exploring side characters and the lore. Rip.
---
dual shield you mean !
---
Thief - Give up stealth for access to barrier and heals - Double focus as a Dragonfist monk with meditations.
---
Warrior - Main hand and off hand pistol with commands for support/healing as a Drill Sergent.
---
Mesmer - Warhorn (to use like a bard so I can make enemies dance while they slowly die)
---
Elementalist - Longbow - Arcane archer.
---
Necromancer - Main and off hand sword with Shroud becoming an f1-f5 system. High mobility with lots of offensive buffs and life steal for the group (but little in the way of direct defense). - Call it a Brood Lord and give it a vampire theme.
---
Rev - Greatsword focused on Fire &amp; Power at close/mid range with Balthazar legend - IDK on name.
---
Engineer - Main hand mace - The Mechanic
---
Guardian - Spear &amp; Wells. Make the virtues like WOW warrior stances in that only one can be active at a time but they grant stronger bonuses (Justice offensive boosts to the group etc.....)
---
I don't have a favourite skill, but i do have favourite setup for sure:
---
- GS\rifle warrior, the first one have the mobility, the second one kiting potential, it feels good
---
- GS\lbow soulbeast, it's even better, same feeling of the one above, but better on any aspect, and cool too.
---
- S\P and P\P thief, i tried as a daredevil, it's pretty fun with his "devil may cry" gamestyle, i'm currently using it with deadeye things, it's awesome too.
---
ele has all these 3 weapons already, by using conjuring elementalweapon skills.
---
[removed]
---
You are just stuck with the ball until you cap the pylon again. We had this happen a couple times where we phased just as we jumped back to the pylon and its an easy reset :(
---
There is actually no content drought. We are getting stable stream of new stuff in last months. The issue is that a lot of people imagined different content...
---
Fractals are successors to Dungeons, and they were released before Raids. They were made for ALL, easy and hardcore. 
---
Raids are exclusively hardcore, which makes the content unique. Making Raids easy will split or even kill the hardcore playerbase.
---
Woodenpotatoes has lire series and there is a great s1 recap but it'2h long video. It's on YouTube
---
Just wanted to say that I'm not the only one. 
---
Also it's a really stupid reason (imo) to get into a guild / static group, because you want to spend your KPs for stuff the KPs were made for.
---
Theif eitther spear or greatsword.
---

Ele scepters?? Forgot if they can use em.
---
&gt; Go check out how much companies are making on microtransactions, and tell me it's a minor issue.
---
Yes, arguments like this make it rather obvious what you are really complaining about here.
---
Since when are Raids story mode? It is a completely separated story that has nothing to do with the main one.
---
&gt;Throwing the responsibility onto the people who are being excluded from the system isn't really a great take. It's a very 'Why don't the poor just work harder?' thoughtless shit take.
---
Are you really trying to draw comparisons with a person not being able to raid in a a game and poor people? Really? 
---
You literally have all the tools to start raiding/pushing fractals today. You even have all the information about everything inside the raids/fractals and how to beat them which the 1dt groups never had. 
---
Contrary to popular belief you don't need to have amazing leadership skills to start a raid group, just the willingness to start it and learn. 
---
&gt;nor do I wish to bother learning any of it until I know I can get my foot in the door
---
And with that mindset you will never get your foot in the door. 
---
&gt;6 months down the road when the raiding community maybe realises they fucked up in slowly bleeding their playerbase dry and try to act like they weren't being jerks this whole time?
---
It's on you to take an interest in the content and push to do it, not just sit and complain and want to be carried. The raiding community aren't being jerks, the pug world has never really been a place of learning it had always been a place where people want to get into groups with others of similar skill levels to bash out some fast clears. If you really want to learn the raids/content join a raiding guild, set up your own guild for that purpose or join a discord community. 
---
It is up to you to have the initiative if it's something that you want.
---
Every time new raid releases it brings new type of KP with it so everyone starts from 0, new raid was released 2 months ago, and people still often ask for 1bclear proof, it's good time to get back you know. Besides W7 is super easy compared to others :)
---
i have 100+li and no one letting me in for w5 and up so i gave up after a while now i raid in ffxiv instead 
---
don't get me wrong i love gw2 i still log in sometimes (living world events etc)
---
only if more ppl were actually like this post...
---
For ele i'd want weapon swap most of all : pick one element and stick to it but get weapon swap. 
---
For new weapon, i'd say pistol or GS.
---
all heroes dont wear capes ;)
---
i did the same for a friend 2 year ago in raid, now he have more than me ;)
---
The original Tome of Courage. Felt like playing a healing monk while using it.
---
It's easier than raids, and you can find GRP faster since it only requires 5 ppl, you should try it :)
---
That was the first step to make GW2 the casual shithole without content and with an awful community that it is. Well, next to no roles and no raids at launch...
---
Seems like a wasted opportunity to gate content behind such high learning curve. Just make scaling difficulties so Anet has a reason to invest into more raids, everyone wins.
---
You play with other people who have the same experience as you
---
Double focus or GS for revenant
---
&gt;such an amazing instanced world
---
Ftfy
---
Hammer necro please and thankyou. I would very much like to use the sh hammer
---
I don't find sabir and Adina engaging, I just find them annoying. The air one is particular is just irritating - not challenging -irritating. Bear in mind  Gorse, KC and Matt are all old fights of several years now and for me they are still actually "fun" to play. Shouldn't W7 really have moved on the game by now in terms of mechanics? I mean the air boss even uses the Matthias circles.
---
Also, interesting you mentioned kiting. This is an example of how I find them uninspiring. Yet ANOTHER boss where someone has to kite. This is exactly what im talking about. How many bosses has one person been given a boring ass job  like kiting to do? KC, Demios, Dhuum, Sabatha and Qadim 1.  You;re actually the first person that has told me they like kiting.
---
 It's the same with Anets obsession with orbs. They rely on things they have done dozens of times already. I hope WIng 8 will be a fresh take on GW2 raids. Please, no more kiting,  orbs, bubbles and the same things they have done for years. Be original.
---
But you're right -each to their own. I absolutely am glad they did another wing, but it's not my favourite and we all can have that. I don't think strike missions are replacing raids though? I believe they are designed as a stepping stone to raids?
---
The point of gatekeeping is to make sure the group is experienced and the run goes smoothly. People can easily gain experience through training runs just like most people do. Join a training discord for raids/fractals
---
It was
---
Also make sure to play something they asked for, I'm way more willing to let people who are not as experienced that play the 'right' classes (as in don't come on some weird ass heal/condi build) join my groups than if they don't.
---
I see. So the only way to know when event starts is the Wiki, and if it isn't being specific, I probably have no idea to know when it happenes?
---
Hero point - I just unlocked those. Can I spend them freely? or there is no respec and I should probably have some long term plan?
---
This is the one. Just great video
---
That's not a good reason to play games.
---
And then people would think: "OH woao, his fren must be gud too!"
---
I totally I agree and I must say that I'm still in the habit of checking someones AP if the other stuff he/she says is dodgy. For example I see someone telling me they have done x ecounter dozens of time with only 1k AP and low KP that is a good indicator for someone that either: Is new and does not know mechanics unrelated to the fight yet or is an alt account that is so bored of raids/fracs that he will probably become toxic at the first point of failure.
---
GW2 endgame is brutal... Lol now I've seen it all
---
Buy more bank slots. Easy
---
https://discretize.eu/
---
It's a guild that specializes in fractals speedclears, they have tutorial, guides and builds, their site is very helpful.
---
You feel like this because very likely until now you haven't seen content that is challenging or requires coordination
---
/shrug
---
Fair enough. Thank you!
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Oh, if you can respec them, nothing to worry about :-) Will spend them as makes sense now and will respec later when I know the mechanics better.
---
You think qadim2 is boring yet gorse is fun? That boss is a golem
---
I’ve been raiding on and off for about a year now. I would say it’s pretty challenging and requires coordination.
---
https://rti.enjin.com/
---
Hard enough for Anet not to have done it yet. I'm sceptical as to whether it's actually in the works
---
This was already posted last week, but it could be a possibility or just an ui error
---
irks me how warbringer has a lot of spears and cant use in land.
---
Oh I’m not saying gw2 has to be all open world. I think the mix of open world, WvWvW, arena style PvP and fractals were a good mix. Fractals were arena nets answer to high level pve dungeon/raid style content. The game had variety and everyone played what they enjoyed. Raids can be decent end game content. But they are a huge resource investment and truly only a hand full of the games player percentage will even try them. That’s why I don’t think raids are a good resource investment. It splits up the pve community and breeds toxicity and elitism which only divides the community even further. Most players won’t even try raids due to the elitist players they will run into and who control the raid scene. Strikes MIGHT be a stepping stone for most players but only time will tell.
---
And that is the second paradox. Player with 425 is not able to get into any group so he is forced to start his own group. But now if he put requirement of 425, nobody with 450 will join because they don't want to be slowed down by 425's. So he has to put 450 requirement or nobody reasonable would join.
---
But still many raid leaders are reasonable and will accept you even with lower gear score if you show them that you are experienced raider. You can do that eq. by linking Ahead of the curve or Cutting edge achievement of some older raids.
---
Why not make your own group though? You clearly have enough experience to start a squad.
---
It is part of the nevermore collections
---
thats your expert opinion?
---
Id love it to use it as a mix of necro(or mesmer) using it as almost a sharp staff to rip holes in the mists to summon projectiles, aoes or just stabbing the ~~bitch~~ enemy. 
---
Traherne as legend ofc :)
---
Then make your own guild or join existing one with more dedicated players. Or do people hate the word "dedicated" because they are too proud being "casual"?
---
There's no story that you cant see in a cleared instance or on cinematics on youtube.

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
Rev scepter as main hand healing thing would be great. last 2 specs were offensive support/Jack of all trades. 
---
Some full heal might be neat. Also. Instead of twin legends maybe have enhanced legends!
---
Yep :p 
---
Plus I choose to think it's been several days since Aurene died instead of right away like the game wants us to believe
---
This is particularly annoying for repeatable ones, like Knight of the Thorn, Mechanist Ninn and Cooking. 
---
For those character-bound side-quests there should be a "Side Stories" category in the Story Journal.
---
100CM had kp's for over 2 years, and ppl have been asking for them for over 2 years (for 100cm runs), you probably don't do fractals very often.
---
You should put the marketing vp face instead of dragon. Or funky pop dragon.
---
Very short version: Scarlett saw the Alchemy, discovered that Sylvari are [spoiler] and became crazy.
---
Then she planned to destroy everything by creating a giant ~~robot~~ marionette.
---
Lion's Arch got destroyed and Mordremoth was awaken thanks to her.
---
That doesn't work for repeatable ones like [Knight of the Thorn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight_of_the_Thorn).
---
How do are you supposed to use achievements that unlock once per account for the rest of the characters in the account? 
---
With pen and paper or a text file like some sort of cave man?
---
I remember it being less of a problem in vanilla wow, where all those "solving" systems you explained did not exist.
---
Noone expected full MC gear to enter MC. But blues were prefered to greens ofc.
---
Noone expected full BWL gear to enter BWL, but they wanted you to have MC gear, which is fine, as there were MC runs going so there was a chance. And so on.
---
Also, ilvl and gearscore didn't mean shit as there were blue lower ilvl items that were better then some MC stuff, so every reasonable guy would understand that.
---
[Cloaks or capes though?](https://youtu.be/CcoXRknPipo)
---
That's where I disagree. I think you will have more players in the end because the hardcore people will play the hardest tiers and will eventually get new player that completed the lower tiers and now want to experience the harder tiers.
---
If you let it be than you will have leas and less people because raid wings need time to release and in the meantime people will leave the game. Then their groups will shatter and additional people will leave.
---
I think with strike missions anet will take on this problem so new players will try raids. but this missions must also be created and I doubt that the normal living world team will do this.
---
EU player here. Everything is fine for me, including DR and LA.
---
&gt;Now, people want to go into raids and clear them as quickly as possible. You have KP checks, build checks, DPS checks, team comp checks etc.
---
This is the disconnect I see in this thread. You are looking to join groups of experienced people which isn't going to fly if you aren't at the same level of experience. These people have already done their wiping and experimentation and are not going to want to do that with a bunch of strangers again. Like you rightly pointed out these experienced people are not going to want to carry people through content and nor should they. 
---
So once again from the top MAKE YOUR OWN GROUPS. If you and everyone else down voting me in this thread just made their own groups this wouldn't be an issue. 
---
Again the only person excluding you from this content is yourself. There are probably 100s if not 1000s of people at a similar experience level when it comes to raids/CM fractals. If you all stopped trying to jump into the experienced groups (who don't want you) and actually tried to learn the content with each other this whole thing wouldn't be an issue.
---
How would it kill the hardcore community...
---
Won't Raids release even slower if devs have to do Easy mode/normal mode/CM? You have to do 2-3 difficulties for each boss of each wing, while thus far we had 2 modes at most.
---
If you start making existing raids easier instead of making new raids, what's there left for hardcore players?
---
You can teamfight with deadeye sniper. I never talked about how potent it is. My own build is somethhing very different and I won't share it. ;)
---
Double spear warrior, holding them on each shoulder, pointing them forward in combat mode and crossed in back when not in combat mode.
---
Or guardian, but guardian uses them as ranged weapons, throwing them.
---
Someone pls make Rytlock Trombone
---
Why not both? :D well...cloaks would have even more clipping
---
Well they have to change something anyway, the current group isn't worth spending time for, so either increase the group(which, for the record, won't happen with easy raids) or just stop developing for said group :)
---
Cloapes
---
If it's just dmg and health than it should be easy. Don't know if this is enough. but strike missions will already take dev time and I doubt that the normal living world team will do them.
---
&gt;I said that I have to keep them, because I need them to find groups, so I can't spend them for an infusion or the tonic. 
---
So just farm more of them than you need to buy tonics and infu, nothing is stoping you, that way you will have both infu and KP to ping, why don't you just do what everyone else does in such situation? 
---
&gt;I never said that I have to start
---
I over-interpreted your post. Sincire apologies.
---
Its healing pales in comparison to guardian/ele staves, to the point that I'd barely even call it a "healing weapon" as much as I would an "astral force weapon" with some minor defensive stuff attached.
---
If one is using the staff mostly for its defensive benefits, there's not much reason not to just use mainhand sword instead, and warhorn (which the sword is usually paired with) comes with a blast finisher to boot. It's why PvP druids (which were already rare) swapped to sword/warhorn and longbow even before the nerfs to the staff.
---
Raid bosses aren't about HP, its mechanics. Vale Guardian can have as much as HP like a open world Champion, but if you don't know the mechanics you will fail either way.
---
Shadversity my bae
---
If you feel okay about posting your pictures in a sub you should maybe know the audience or at least be tolerant with the outcome.  
---
If you have not enough brain power to think about something like this could happen, then why do you expect said brain power from EVERYONE in a sub to care about your feelings? It only takes one person for a post like this to happen.

---
playing games and doing business are 2 different things too.
---
how do you know that the higher ups are doing what you claim?
---
Is it right away in the game? I had the feeling that indeed a few days went by. Or at least a few hours, devs being obscure on purpose there.
---
On a sidenote, from a design point of view I'm glad they didn't send us on a wild goosechase that ended up exactly how everyone and their mum anticipated, but used the time instead for Kralkatorrik.
---
If they'd have a quest list, and a reward for X amount of quests completed, I'd be jumping back in-game like there's no tomorrow.
---
Achievement points are boring and I really can't be bothered with them. But the classical quest-feel really sparks my interest!
---
i want to dualwield GS on my war
---
I said people, not you. I never had problems making my own parties.
---
Omg if this is true I'd be so damn happy!
---
&gt;I can get in today? Where? By sitting around all day trying to make my own group that no one joins?
---
Last year I came back to GW2 for a couple of months tried to start my own raid guild for people that wanted to start out but got no where. Decided fuck it and just posted in the LFG with my only requirement was joining my discord for easy communication. It took about 15-20mins to get a group together for W1 and within 2 months I had cleared everything other than Dhuum. There are a lot of people in the same position as you and you are all unwilling to make groups of your own for whatever reason. 
---
&gt;I've cleared harder raids in better games and I have to go join a training guild to learn 'fire bad'. 
---
While I understand your frustration people don't care what you do in other games and the reason the whole "training guild" thing exsists in GW2 is because the average skill level of gw2 players is just really bad.
---
On the third month\*^(1)
---
On the third minute\*^(2)
---
^(1)If playing actively and waited for War Eternal..)  
---
^(2) If replaying after War Eternal release.)
---
Rifles need more love. So many beautiful skins and for so few uses
---
You can send us a screenshot, we'll tell you what you can throw away. If you dont want to, however, go gw1 style and just make a character to store all that shit. I had two toons like that with ascended gear
---
Innacurste because they dont blind you at a glance
---
Don´t buy gw2 from shops that are not official retailers of anet, there is  chance you get banned, but yes if you buy PoF in anyway you get HoT
---
Quests with Lore, don't you dare ask for this, you mad !  
---
Joko aside, I prefer traditionnal quest over those freaking soul-less collections
---
&gt;Is it right away in the game?
---
Anet's super ambiguous as to how much time passes. They \*tried\* to make it feel like some time passes between All or Nothing and War Eternal - they often do, but more so here with the Requiem stories that didn't make it into the game - but if you're playing the episodes one after another, Aurene's death and resurrection is less than 5 minutes apart in gameplay.
---
The thing is, those 100s if not 1000s of people are not there. Only experienced people and 1s or 10s of new people at a time. The experienced are the only choice 99% of time.
---
So he moves of and then what? Being useless elsewhere?
---
Bearing in mind that they laid off most if not all of the people who worked on that legacy code? Very hard.
---
I think we all could have lived with more weight on Aurene being dead.
---
Resurrecting her right away because "we all knew it was going to happen so why delay" was, imo, downright idiotic storywriting.
---
"We all know the big bad is going to die, so let's kill him off right away." Perfect way on how you do *not* get a story written.
---
what examples do you have of this?
---
it is an permanent account unlock, so you can use it often as you want with every character
---
Airplane box in novelties was satan's job.
---
Ah yes, the character depths and deep lore we can explore with collecting 20 bearasses
---
Not even sure I felt the full impact of her death with how heavily ANet slapped the player in the face with the Joko reviving thing.
---
Mesmer: anytime you'd summon a clone you instead summon a orb that persists on the battlefield and isn't bound to a specific target. Your f1-f4 will use these orbs as resources. F1, for instance, will send all orbs to the target location, dealing dmg on the way and exploding upon reaching its destination, and so on. Weapon will be the hammer, and the mesmer will use it as a firearm (think of a mix of Jayce and Syndra from league of legends).
---
I would like to see a more nature magic dmg focused ranger spec, so scepter maybe? 
---
An elementalist can a only change attunement out of combat but can now weapon swap. Now you can call yourself a "water elementalist" and be a pure healer. Or go "earth elemental ist" for more defence or what not. The elementalist gains access to mace/mace and all other weapons that are available to other elementalist elite specs (otherwise there would be too few weapons to cholse from) that's right you can be a sword/warhorn fire elementalist now! The f1-f4 does something else now, suggestions?
---
It also worked up to ulduar for me. And I cant tell about the modern fights, but muru prenerf and yogg 0 were quite the beast for us. Point is, you did not expect to beat every boss back then. And with that mindset progression means something else than today.
---
It's only about ca generation so you can push out might.
---
Works for me, extra points if we get those sweet animations Balthazar was using
---
Qadim 2 is as exciting as you make it. If you want to not deal with any of the mechanics to make the kill faster then I cant help you with that, but that doesnt make the boss a golem
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Every time you do Knight of the Thorn with a character that has completed Heart of Thorns is a quest.  Not tracking it anymore doesn't make it less of a quest, it only makes it more annoying to track. 
---
Right now there's four. Demanding 5 is arbitrary, and it doesn't really matter if there's 1 or 20 exceptions. If they prepare a side story journal, they can use it in the future for future character-bound parts of side stories, which adds replayability without adding the nuisance of having to remember in which step your character is. 
---
1. Knight of the Thorn
---
2. Bloodstone Rifts
---
3. Mechanist Ninn and the awakened invasions
---
4. Cooking
---
And there's other things that were made account bound but only make sense if they are character bound, mostly the personal bits of side-stories, like the character seeing Anomaly visions after arriving to Bloodstone Fen.
---
Right but they could make it a repeatable achievement, like so many other achievements. It's a pain in the ass to track because they didn't make it a repeatable achievement.
---
Bandit bounties are a repeatable achievement and you can track it. The ornate key treasure chests that you get from blood in the water is a repeatable quest and you can track it and see which chests you've opened and which you haven't. 
---
Just because Anet didn't make them repeatable quests, doesn't mean they couldn't and it would still be using the achievement panel. That's my point.
---
Butts are the real heroes.
---
A repeatable achievement only tells you that the account can do it again and how many times any character of the account has done it.  
---
It doesn't track what a particular character has done. It doesn't tell you in what step of the process a character is.
---
I have to use a freaking spreadsheet to track which characters have done Knight of the Thorn.  
---
A spreadsheet. 
---
The only proper way to track what a character has done is with an individual Journal.  
---
We already have a journal for story, but it does not include an entry for character-based side stories. It needs an entry for side stories to track character-based ones.
---
guardian-warhorn- elitè spec:paragon (we have shout... soo i will add chant or echo skills
---
Elsewhere, like in more open world content that's boring after an hour? A MMO wirhout endgame content isn't worth playing
---
to bad there soon will be no endgame players anymore, cause gw2 turned into a singe player game now
---
Nice.
---
I was kind of hoping we'd get something like a Krait witch legend if we had main hand sceptre. Something evil and icy, with chains and a gothic flair. We have enough 'good' legends
---
This reddit has been stormed by criticism,memes, disappointment,rants,vents for a week. There's nothing more to be said and Anet dont care to make a statement to either appease the people or clear the situation. Believe me a lot happened if you know where to look.
---
WvW is emptier than b4, raid lfg you only find low experienced "semi training something come carry us" groups and the usual sells and only monday has some activity. Fractal cm group with high reqs take almost an hour to fill. Literally most people complaining on Reddit packed up and left. There are some sweet titles out there atm to play,most mmos have new expansions and some really big mmos are coming on the next month. Meanwhile Gw2 and "Sagas" are treated like a meme on most discussions. People are past being upset atm,they just treat it as a joke.
---
You need 5 years of experience to apply to this entry level job
---
&gt; 30-45m (or more) on Artsari depending on DPS, and then either 1-3 hours on Arkk
---
how could you have even deal with such a mess... normally a full run with cms and all t4 takes you like 28-40 min max.
---
people should just stop chasing "meta" sometimes, if they cant even do their rota and die 2-3 times a minute and go for a save strat...
---
Heal (Druid) + Quickness (Guardian) + Alacrity (Revenant) + DPS + DPS
---
You sir, are one of the reasons we have to ask for 250+ kp for CMs and T4s.
---
I'm a returning player and I have always mained Thief P/P because I liked its mobility and gameplay but I know people don't regard it as a good build/class for fractals. I absolutely only enjoy PP Thief so years ago, I created a warrior because everyone had it and it was easy to deal damage with but easily got bored of it boring gameplay and rotation. Now after a couple of years, I have returned and decided to try something different and went for a Power Reaper and I am enjoying it so much that I have now decided to make it my main even though I was a good Thief player.
---
Now, I keep reading banter over Reapers because it's "one of the weakest dps" for fract and raids.. Did I make a mistake? 
---
I also want to have a Guardian but atm, I fell in love with Reaper.
---
Is it okay for me to continue to play Reaper?
---
A credit card will build your credit rating. Make the minimum payment each month.

I dont like the way you drew your boots, makes your whole character look fat.
---
Problem is, a lot of MMOs hit the reset button with expansions. In GW2 the opposite happens, neverending powercreep with each elite spec and balance patch.
---
Same thing happened in GW1 but Anet bailed out to make GW2 before it got too bad.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who thought that!
---
Renegade in particular can also provide a ton of stability through Jalis, which is amazing QoL.
---
As strange as it may sound I want to see a class use a spear above water. It's one of the earlier weapons in mankind's arsenal and it's only used underwater. Feels like wasted potential to me.
---
Is this what having a stroke feels like?
---
Except that instead of getting traditional quests, we get traditional quests that can only be played ONCE per account. And they fail to recognize that.  
---
  
---
The Knight of the Thorn storyline for example would have been a gorgeous quest, and is one of the few achievements that was fun to do purely for the sake it, regardless of any rewards
---
"Join low AP/token/whatever-shit groups" doesn't some the problem of people being shitty and needing to be shitty because of how much worse OK people are at the game than Good players, which is that way because of ANETs balancing.

---
* When I hit max storage on Iron Ore + Iron Ingots, I craft some Deldrimor Steel ingots.  Same goes for cloth, leather and wood.
---
* Craft your ascended cooldowns regularly (not necessarily daily) such as Lump of Mithrillium.
---
Just adding a info that may be obvious: after using the item itself, aplying the skin will cost a transmutation charge.
---
He also asked "Can Chronomancer still be played as a boon support?"
---
So what's your point?
---
How about an option to disable map rewards for your account, would that solve your issue?
---
I enjoy some the PVE builds showing up on Meta Battle but I am definitely interested in these class breakdowns. I have always been told to copy Raid builds and it’s good enough for PVE and WP brings up a good point that those builds are meant for a team and not solo content.
---
You can usually get for a Harrier+Minstrel on the healer thanks to the fractal potions to get a bit more survival (very nice for FB). For the one that is not a healer you will need either almost full Diviner (can't really hope to get 100% Alacrity uptime without this) or just a touch of Diviner (for Power Quickbrand) as you don't need that much boon duration to maintain Quickness, even less for a short fight with pre-stack: 15% (the potion) is enough to maintain it assuming perfect Alacrity but getting a bit more (like to 30%) is really nice while getting a hang of the role.
---
\+1 for Headbutt, can't believe nobody else mentioned it :D
---
&gt; rehash old content would not be a popular 
---
I feel like Twisted Marionette and Tower of Nightmares would be popular
---
Gross. Did he ping a staff but had S/P on swap or something?
---
I used to run Arah with that account back when it had 400AP. People knew pretty much instantly that it was an alt account.
---
&gt; There are so many achievements and collections
---
It's funny that you answered yourself there in the first words of your post. What's the first thing you do when you come across a hub with NPCs that have exclamation marks hovering everywhere? Well, if you are like most players, you accept them. Achievements are essentially auto-accepted quests, why add the extra step of having to talk to an NPC first? (Some of them do, yes. Are they better because you have to go to an NPC and get an item that start the achievement for the item collection? ...).
---
Quests have a very specific meaning in Guild Wars 2, where they are essentially hearts you are supposed to be able to complete quickly within the current area.
---
What this game might benefit from is better achievement tracking, tracking WIP achievements in progress by sorting through the most recent, and having it work alongside daily achievements. People are literally complaining because they don't have a bulkier system in place to realize how much worse an idea it could be to have a journal either completely and utterly destroyed by quests, or limited to a certain number of them and being forced to go back to location A when they want to pick those they didn't have room for back into their journals. Rebranding a system and forcing extra steps to it (of which admittedly some of them are very quest-chain like) won't fix it. Calling it "Quests" and calling for a "Journal" is just playing word games to dismiss what we already have.
---
If I might afford myself a jab, let me say that it's almost like clockwork: casuals have to do something to do things they are not used to to get things such as a Skyscale or Gourmet Training? Complain! Then they go back to complaining about this whole game being for "casuals" because they think they are hot stuff in the 1% of the game they do focus on.
---
I'm not willing to pay for the latest addon for a bit of PvE and then having the same problem with every raidwing besides probably the latest. 
---
I used to love GW2 and played it for years, but when I had nothing else to do besides raids and then got denied to do them I uninstalled it the moment I finished the Fractals backpack, didn't even look forward to the legendary armor which would have been released shortly after. 
---
I enjoyed raiding because I like challenging content, but with like five full clears of W1 you don't get far with finding groups.
---
Dual pistol necromancer/demon hunter would be sick.
---
Reaper is a fine DPS class. Enjoy it. Those comments were maybe relevant a year ago, but not anymore. 
---
Scourge is also a great condi class for raids, check it out.
---
It has nothing to do with how difficulty tiers exist in wow... the whole point is that people do it in gw2 with a single tier of difficulty and without that equipment requirement. 
---
Just how people act.
---
Considering that the OP is saying this idea would give ANet millions, I think its a case of pot calling kettle black, unless the OP is a member on a board for a video game dev/publisher, if that's the required benchmark to give educated opinions on an industry.
---
I think it's been at least a few days. I think canonically we went out "somewhere" because they couldn't find us for a bit. Plus the way everyone is grieving doesn't seem as raw as it did at the end of All or Nothing.
---
Anyway that's my headcanon.
---
&gt; I'm having lots of fun exploring the vast world and doing all kinds of events around the map, including the cool Shadow Behemoth and the renown hearts.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; what should I really be doing 
---
You kind of answered your own question. Don't worry about endgame for now, just enjoy having fun. That's the whole point at the end of the day. It's the sort of game that encourages you to set your own goals.
---
They're not that bad, but you have to be active to make use of them all because you're going to need a bunch of them. Actually doing the 20 minute treasure hunt can be a nice profit. Trade contracts can be turned into mats and the keys are also always useful for that.
---
Personally I just put up high KP requirements and don’t bother to check. The person who joined is likely going to either be truthful and have it, or lying and trying their best so that’s all I really need. Occasionally people will just try to get a free ride too, but that becomes obvious quickly and I always have at least 3 people I know in the group so we can kick if truly needed.
---
I'd love to see them get mace/torch.
---
I'd buy a new slot just to rock [Fixer Upper](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fixer_Upper) and [Sinister Welding Torch](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sinister_Welding_Torch).
---
It's this way because anet is catering to the lowest common denominator and they ask for nerfs to essentially any content. Also the reason they blame gatekeeping 24/7 even when there are next to no groups left on lfg. 
---
Sub would rather have 0 listings in lfg than have a few listings with KP requirements.
---
Oh just saw it XD
---
Yeah, your playstyle matters a lot in how you percieve this.
---
How did you get this shot?
---
people dont have time to do that, even anet know this and didnt add any guild content since HoT, and thats sad for me btw.  
---
They could at least add looking for guild feature, but even with alliances out they wont do that...   
---
Guild are dead on the game that have them in the title.
---
Fortunately, you actually can redo at least PART of that! While you cannot do the two collections a second time (since picking up the pieces/picking up the motes removes them from the interactable world) you can at least do the more story-focused chunk of it as many times as you finish HoT on new characters. I've restored it twice now, and probably will do it at least a time or two more. Just doesn't feel right \*not\* to do it after beating HoT.
---
so maybe people who say raids dont fit this game and were a mistake are right. Majority of players in this casual story driven mmo dont have time to commit and learn.
---
Warrior needs scepter because reasons.
---
CM means challenge mote, since is somethign you can activate in certain instances (some raids, some fractals, and a couple in LWS2/HoT story) which adds a challenge beyond the normal version. And 100 would be fractal level 100.
---
Some people have fun in ways that others may not.  
---
That's why we have 578 dyes.
---
And yet in HoT we had 2 staff Elite specs and 2 using shield . With PoF they did the same with Axe. All of these were pretty common anyway do i doubt Anet's main concern is rarity od certain weapon type. If you try hard enough you can think of elite spec based on a weapon, like the pistol you mentioned. Only thing is, why try that hard when there are other weapons, more thematic available.
---
I would love to see hammer necro, dual sword thief or gunslinger guardian but when i think about skills they would use, i dont think aby of these would be useful. Necro has enough ranged weapons like scepter, staff and axe. Do we really need a pistol to replace scepter or rifle instead od Staff? Or should we get some melee weapon that focuses around dodge/block/dash? Cause i'd like necro that can summon a puff of smoke, jump behind the enemy and see "evade" or "block" when said enemy tries to counter.
---
Personally I feel that it's the AI issue that Trahearne feels useless.
---
how about think for yourself instead of choosing between random strangers and outdated websites
---
r/thathappened
---
His name? Rhytbert Brimstein.
---
Is there any screenshot of this pure awesomeness by any chance?
---
My sibling likes to tell me Trahearne is a necromancer an is ok for him to be weird and is a favourite because he says "Well done, commander". 
---
Yes his tone is so dull imo. 
---
I agree with you with Warmaster Forgal and Sierran. I feel the same. The only thing is I haven't tried Whisper storyline so I can't tell, unless I go find some YouTube footage. XD
---
oh shit
---
Which is why they need to complain about requirements and difficulty to shift blame to stuff out of their reach. Easier than admitting they're unable to raid in a game as easy as gw2.
---
I agree that treasure hunting kits are pretty bad, but to this day I'm always happy to get trader keys.
---
Thank you for your viewpoint too!
---
I managed to entirely miss your comments on visual quality of the bosses. Apologies for this. I agree with you fully. Larger and more imposing bosses would be very cool and I do agree with Sabir and Adina were pretty lazy from a design stand point. I'd also like to have more bosses like SH and LT where they have to be moved about since that adds a good degree of difficulty!
---
What is the Armor skin of the FB please ?
---
full berserker power firebrand, diviner renegade. if you pug you can go condi firebrand too
---
harrier renegade if you really want to heal (in endgame you shouldn't)
---
People can do fractals for that
---
While leveling up, so far I'm lvl 31, is it worth to keep drops from monsters which lands in my inventory such as skins/blood etc. for potential future crafting or not? and if not I'm guessing it is better to sell on trade board instead of vendor due to better price?
---
I do not think fully separating the two would work. But for sure the UI desperately needs a redesign and some better categorization than the current one. And they need to be better highlighted as well.
---
That's the order I should invest in?
---
I wanna see a good longbow class... and/or whatever nonsense the light armor classes would do with a bow.
---
Without KP, we'd practice true gatekeeping.
---
Friends only, no randoms.
---
It absolutely, absolutely can, but you just need to wait like 3 seconds instead of having it all ready for you. Continuum Split now lasts twice as long, so you can get both support wells out on one clone. 
---
It's really not *that* different other than you need to press 3 on sword to get a clone first.
---
Should request meat skins for next black lion weapon skins, just in time for meat-tober!
---
More or less, yeah, theres a ton of freedom for heal scourge! I use flock runes, for that last effect, party heal on using a heal skill. The only thing that affects barrier is actually vitality! That's why magi scourge is the best lol. Almost 35k hp!
---
Necro has greatsword and torch. The only thing I'd love to see would be either the main hand torch or scythe.
---
On my Elementalist I want a pistol (water pistol when on water)
---
And they even all ready have a quest system (Personal/Living Story). Not sure why they can’t use that for side quests.
---
They could still add some in game. They don't have to be flashier, just unique.
---
I don't think it's asking much that for every, say, 25 items put in the gemstore, 1 could be in game (not sure how the ratios would work, but you get what I mean). 
---
Even just recolored versions, maybe using dye colours related to the locations they are in (from the elonian dye set or example on a raptor skin that drops in a certain meta event).
---
You could even have it as a low chance random drop (like invis boot level chance or lower), so people would run it over and over. Maybe even make them sellable on the tp.
---
the dt Website hasn't been updated in a long time but it will be soon. you can join there discord and they'll say fbd+rene+bs+2dps
---
And my teacher said i can be anything so i will become a flying donkey.
---
Yup. Making some defensive changes to glass DPS builds (a utility here, a trait there) is usually enough. But if you're never planning to take that class into raids or fractals it's weird to attempt to gear up into the assassin/berserker/Viper/Commander mix that that's expensive AF to get.
---
Itll be nice to be able to link newbies to more generic open world oriented builds.
---
I've been thinking about the original Guildwars series lately (considering starting a fresh character and playing through it all) and trying to figure out what elements made/make it such a damn good game. I started to feel like most of the list was omitted from GW2 (also a great game, but I think for a lot of different reasons). What were some of your favorite elements of gw1? Hall of Heroes + GvG were really awesome game modes and shined alongside the game mechanics (I miss build wars!) So many viable builds and strategies that allowed for high individual skill caps (balanced team comps with reaction-based plays). The fact that two teams could sustain a fight for so long made for awesome chess-like matches. Farmable, difficult, rewarding pve zones (e.g. underworld). I think I prefer cool looking rare items that have low drop rates over being forced to grind for months on end for a legendary. I'll stop my reminiscing rant there for now...
---
I don't want traditional quests, I don't mind resorting to it.
---
&gt; I have always been told to copy Raid builds and it’s good enough for PVE and WP brings up a good point that those builds are meant for a team and not solo content.
---
Exactly this, and this needs to be made clear for any player that is looking to constantly improve their mastery over their characters. The main reason that raid builds *can* work in open world/solo content isn't because they're the best builds by leaps and bounds (otherwise they'd work well in WvW, please don't try raid builds in WvW), but because open world/solo content isn't difficult enough to force constant build alterations and adaptations. It's also the same reason that you could tell people to run WvW builds or PvP builds in open world; it's just that easy to run whatever you want.
---
Looking at any and all meta or recommended builds is important because it deepens your understanding of what your class is capable of, and is going to be your personal form of character progression long after you have your character decked out in ascended/legendary gear with all your traits and skills unlocked. Understanding the context of what the build is being built towards, the rationale on *why* specific skills and traits are recommended can be such a huge improvement on your ability to perform on your class, even if you aren't always using those builds.
---
I will always tell players who are looking to improve their knowledge to look at any and all builds and try to discern the ideas behind the build, but to try to understand that those builds are being made for specific game modes with specific functionality in mind.
---
Raid builds are terrible for PvE if only because they don't have their own source of boons. So much depth in the way to build characters is wasted by the raid meta. Most classes have interesting ways to build for open world that's actually pretty fun.
---
\&gt;  Also, ANet and other gaming companies *are* part of an industry that is attempting to misinform the public at large about the nature of the product they sell - EA's "surprise mechanics" quote comes from a literal lobbying effort from them to prevent lootboxes from being considered to be gambling in the UK. 
---
This is really a stretch. First of all, ANet and NCSoft are not EA, not nearly as large as EA, not nearly as involved in lobbying as EA (if at all, it's not an American company after all), and not nearly as predatory as EA. MMOs have \*\*always\*\* had and required some additional revenue stream in order to support a long content pipeline, because an MMO lives and dies by its thriving community. A single player game, or even a shooter with lobbies and no massivley multiplayer component, \*\*does not need this pipeline\*\*, and that's why microtransactions for those games are \*\*so\*\* much more predatory than microtransactions in GW2. GW2 microtransactions pay for the game (with no subscription fee, reminder) in between expansion releases, which keeps people playing the content, which is necessary for the game to deliver its promise of an MMO. EA selling gamble boxes for FIFA pays EA executives; FIFA doesn't need or use that money for active development of the game. Hell, they sell a new game every year with nothing changed except the roster! It's insane that games like that, or a purely single player game like Shadow of Mordor, have microtransactions. 
---
Bottom line: grouping all microtransactions into the same bin and then labeling that bin as bad is reductionist. For an MMO like GW2, the choice is not between "microtransactions" and "no microtransactions". It's between "optional microtransactions", "microtransactions that are necessary to enjoy the game," and "mandatory subscription fee". Most games have two of those, and some have three. GW2 is fortunate to only have one. 
---
\&gt;  Your sports analogy falls apart because the behaviour most analogous to the selling of lootboxes or the selling of addictive food items is not the sport itself, but the sites and organizations that facilitate the gambling - which are, in some places, actually banned. 
---
Gambling is only ever banned in the US because the government wants to control the tax revenue from the absolutely immense gambling industry, and because with so much cash flowing around it's very easy to use casinos to facilitate illegal activity like money laundering. It's much harder to control and regulate gambling if anyone can do it anywhere, so different governments set up different rules to cluster gambling. Gambling is not regulated to stamp it out or to help people with gambling addictions. If that were the case, casinos would refuse habitual gamblers or tie their max losses to their paycheck or something like that, but that obviously doesn't happen. For a gambling addict, there is no solution except self-control, because no Western government is actually standing in between a gambler and his addiction. Hell, you can't even go to a convenience store without scratch cards being prominently displayed. 
---
My point is this: we expect people with other addictions to regulate themselves. This is not to say that there are no addict support programs; obviously, there are hotlines and support groups and therapy, and for most chemical addictions you can purchase products to help reduce cravings. But, there is always going to be a level of personal responsibility to simply live in a society where temptations are everywhere, and most people are expected to handle them. An alcoholic needs to be able to deal with seeing a drink menu at every restaurant he goes to, even if he never steps foot in a bar again. A gambler needs to deal with seeing the winning lottery numbers on TV every night, and seeing scratch cards at the check out counter, and seeing their office run a fantasy football league or Superbowl pool. A fast food addict cannot drive for more than 5 minutes down most roads without seeing a temptation. A sugar addict cannot check out of any grocery store, pharmacy, or convenience store without being presented with a wall of candy and other sweets. 
---
So why is it any different that someone addicted to lootbox gambling shouldn't be expected to deal with a system that is benign, even beneficial, to the majority of players? Furthermore, there are ways a person with a gambling addiction can deal with lootbox gambling that other addicts can't. You can simply not buy the game, for one thing. You can effectively remove the immediate temptation from your life, permanently. No other addict has that option. 
---
Expecting addicts to be accountable for their actions is not a provocative or controversial thing. We do it every day, because basically anything that is pleasurable can turn into an addiction, but we also like to talk about (and sell) pleasurable things. So really, it's a matter of how much inconvenience and cost you are willing to pay in order to make it easier for an addict to control their habit. In the case of GW2's lootboxes? I'm not willing to part with much, because of how non-essential GW2 specifically is, and how beneficial GW2's business model is for most players. From a utilitarian perspective, the trade-off of a few people's happiness from playing the game (I'm assuming, here, that they would do the healthy thing and quit playing if they can't control their spending) is not greater than the thousands or tens of thousands of players who would only get to play GW2 because it has such a lenient business model. 
---
This is not the same as blaming. I'm not blaming anybody. People get addicted to different things for different reasons, and the presence of an addiction doesn't make you a lesser person, and it doesn't even mean it's your "fault" for getting addicted in the first place. I have immense amounts of sympathy for anyone stuck in an addictive, self-destructing cycle. That's irrelevant, though, to the question of what do we as a society do about addiction. And, for every case I can think of, the answer to that question revolves around the addict being responsible for taking themselves away from situations that trigger their addiction.
---
Well, they could do it as they did with the legendary backpacks which included a Glider. But those are legendary things and require a lot of gold already to get done.
---
Checking on Gw2efficiency crafting Ad infinitum costs 1,372 gold (2,937 gems) and the ascension 879 gold (1,881 gems). Not including the Playtime to get those items like shards etc.
---
So not that much different than a price of a mount skin.
---
Still, they earn their money with that and you only really earn money while making it something the consumer needs and wants.
---
I don't like them and I think they are too expensive for my liking so I don't buy them, Still, it makes sense to have them only available through the gem store.
---
And adding one skin per release would be 6 skins each ~20 bucks so 120 bucks possibly of each player. that is a lot of money they wouldn't get.
---
No, thief is a decent dps.
---
Hardly at all! You even have more or less complete freedom of weapon choice. People will complain you're not using dagger/torch or whatever for lifeforce upkeep but, from experience, in fractals, lifeforce is absolutely not a problem, considering you'll be tagging every single mob near your group with your shade skills, and your massive amount of vitality means you have a ton of life force anyways lol
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PSwEcEmpMDWC7hpxMxU9S91B-zxIYwojvMSsCqOF0ZW8bzC-e
---
That you also have to buy though.
---
They also have 10 times more employees and earn more multiple billion dollar annually while ArenaNet doesn't even hit the hundred million. So not really comparable.
---
Player who bought both expansions as they released, and played living world as they came out...and I'm completely happy with the game.
---
Looking forward to the new season of course, and I'm liking cooking 500 and loved the Skyscale achievements...idk maybe I'm just easily pleased but I have so few complaints as to he effectively none that are real, valid issues that ruin my enjoyment.
---
That said, I certainly don't begrudge anyone their right to be unhappy for whatever reason, but to imply that anyone who's played the game for years is now unhappy is simply not true.
---
The wooden Sword do the same dmg of a Legendary weapon. Wp Gw your character progression was amazing.
---
Now that's a toxic statement from an entitled little shit. What did you expect, Legendary weapons and mount skins as drops? Maybe even gems (though BL keys are already a possible drop)?
---
ANet has given us an amazing expansion, bounties and fantastic events like Serpent's Ire are already their own rewards. If you don't like the game, don't play it. 
---
Goodbye, entitled little child. Don't let the door hit you on your way out, and buy some gems before you log out.
---
The purpose of the kps is to show experience, not skill. And the rate of good skill level is higher with experience.
---
Ye, but it does not need to be a mount for same feel of progression. Different mastery is also progression. Anyone remembers that you are ressing 25% faster jsut because of mastery? 
---
Actually having some non-mount masteries would be breath of fresh air, in my point of view.
---
I give a shit. I never paid anything for Living world Episodes like at all.
---
And a single episode might not be that much but if you look at the all you will get more than an expansion, that you also have to buy.
---
Its always fascinating to me to remember the time when HoT was announced and everyone was complaining about the price and that they "promised not to do expansions" and now everyone wants another expansion.
---
It honestly feels like you're just suggesting that one window be split into two windows. How would you even differentiate between achievements which are "quests" and which are just achievements? Is killing 1000 bats a quest or an achievement? Is a multi-step achievement with a fetch quest in the middle of it like finding 50 dragon eggs a quest or an achievement? Is collecting all 18 krait weapons a quest or an achievement? How about collecting all skins from a particular dungeon? What about meta achievements, some of which depend on achievements that are undoubtedly quest-like? 
---
There's a search bar and a lot of well-defined categories. That seems to me to be far better organization than trying to split up achievements based on \*\*how\*\* they're completed.
---
Probably already said since this kind of post comes every week.
---
Farm gold, convert to gems, buy the skin.
---
Would be fun to have a collection with some lore for a skin, but that would be too.much work for them, low priority, the "lore" part would be ignored by a large amount of players, and would give less money to anet.
---
Yea i don't know. People think buying a game and its further patches "free". 
---
We actually pre-order some of the content and hope it is good. That is not "free". Imagine if PoF had 0 content released for it for that launch price and content, would be the scam of the year.
---
Greatsword rev or nothing
---
Not my thief :v
---
Yes! Exactly what I was thinking, minus the kneeling cause I really hated doing that when I gave deadeye a try but it just didn't click. 
---
Was thinking something like a hunter that chases down his prey kind of style, run and gun with toss-able items like nets or improved traps
---
Counterpoint: No it wasn't.
---
&gt; sheer lack of statics wanting to train permanent members
---
this is just wrong, at least on EU i saw  groups exactly like that..the real problem is the playerbase that doesn't actually want to learn
---
a lot want either some easy clears and carries or simply don't wanna put in the effort to actually learn their class..i've seen my fair share of trainings: people overestimate their experience a lot, dps can't even get like 60% benchmark which is just shameful, "support" gameplay is even worse etc.
---
i still remember that 3k dps weaver at KC training run, saying "i can't be bothered to learn the rotation it has too many buttons"..this is exactly how like 99% of the playerbase thinks and acts, they aren't some precious souls willing to improve
---
&gt; especially if you want to learn the CM raids
---
this is entirely 100% on anet for not making them repeatable or with any form of incentive whatsoever! obviously people will just get their titles and whatnot then never touch cms again except to help close friends(and sell i guess)
---
Last week we had guy join our 50kp w5/6/7 group , he said he had no kp but he knows mechanics really well but had no luck with training runs. We gave him chance. He was 3rd dps, and took backup green on dhuum when kiter failed. He was was with us w6/7 and we did all one shot. 
---
Give ppl chance. :)
---
Try preaching that over on /r/guildwars and see if there's any disagreement.
---
 [https://discretize.eu/](https://discretize.eu/)
---
I would really love to see this implemented in the game! It would be really great for the community!
---
&gt; That is one mount skin that players wouldn't need to buy. The thing is, WoW is financed through a subscription based business modell, GW2 is not. 
---
WoW now gets most of its money from the shop too. Lots of people buying gold, mount skins, race changes, level boosts etc.
---
If mount skins were difficult enough to obtain in-game (something like the skyscale collection) the majority of people who prefer to buy skins currently would still buy them instead of earn them.
---
It would be really healthy for the game - the best thing to happen to S4 maps was the skyscale collection. So many people found a reason to be on them for more than the time it took to run through the story instances. Rewards in GW2 are trash tier and part of why maps seem so dead so quickly is there is very little worth working towards on them.
---
A huge portion of WoW content is actually built around time gated journeys towards earning rewards. That's a big part of what sustains its content. GW2 doesn't have that.
---
Why wouldn’t you take power berserker banners? They comparable DPS while increasing group DPS
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced heroes of different classes there that can guide you to the right direction.
---
Alternatively please check out this [class guide](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play).
---
You bought the game with the promise of living world episodes and extra content as it goes on.
---
Yet most valuable skins in WoW are the ones you buy like the tcg ones.
---
Nice
---
Ahh the elitist BS that endgame dungeons/raids breed. Glad I don't participate in that toxic crap.
---
&lt;3
---
Yes, that is exactly what I said: I will quit playing this game unless the PoF map rewards are alternating between Gems, BL Keys and Precursor weapons.
---
[I see.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg?1315930535)
---
I quite honestly agree with you. As someone who wakes up each morning sad that i woke up alive, i know after trash day ill have time with few ppl i met ingame. 
---
While my depressions are not gonna stop, at lease few hours i spend in gw2 remove reality.
---
fully agreed, that for T4 it can be a great addition and is hard to replace with the White Mantel Portals since they are quite limited
---
well technically yes, but the point with the boons still stands - most builds can be altered slightly and suddenly can provide themselves atleast some boons, be it quickness or a decent amount of might stacks and suddenly you're super op
---
As a general rule of thumb, salvage all equipment of rarity white, blue and green with the cheapest salvage kit available (Crude Salvage Kit). For rares (yellow) above level 68, sell on the Trading Post stuff that costs more than 1 Glob of Ectoplasm (so &gt;20 silver, mainly greatswords if you don't want to check every single time) and salvage the ones that cost less with the best salvage kit (Master's Salvage Kit or Mystic Salvage Kit).
---
For exotics, I recommend you check the TP price on a per item basis as they can get quite pricey and you can decide for yourself if you want the skin, or prefer to sell it, or if you prefer to salvage it with a good salvage kit.
---
&gt; Farm gold, convert to gems, buy the skin.
---
This mindset will make most of the game not rewarding to play. We need unique reward for each map and type of gameplay, not just "farm gold buy stuff".
---
Rifle on necro.
---
Everytime my necro gets a rifle bundle it always looks so awesome to me, but I really don't like almost all of the existing rifle skills on the professions that do have them, so I'm basically also asking for a rifle with skills I'd like.
---
So basically, a pipe dream.
---
Harrier is pretty good for Heal Rev, but I usually use Minstrel on my Heal FB as it doesn't gain much from extra BD/Power and it's easy to share as a WvW/Raid set.
---
For the 'dps' versions of the builds you'd use a mix of diviner and zerk. FB barely needs any diviner while Ren needs upwards of 78% (in slower groups).
---
Guardian off hand knife, mainly because it's one of the few classes where the off hand options are all pretty bad anyway. Shield is fun but not really useful, focus is just terrible, torch is situationally good but situationally bad in other places. Knife is a chance to fix it.
---
I'd also be cool with land trident, land trident would be a pretty sick way of giving new life to an old pony even if it means making a second trident. I think it would be a pretty sweet weapon too, maybe with some cool cripple trait builds where you get buffs for attacking a cripple or crowd controlled target. Spear would also be nice.
---
For the last time: I don’t want that. If i wanted that, I would have played wow
---
*don’t eat me please
---
What if while you are kneeled you take control of the pet? The ranger themselves would fire from the backline and the pet would become the frontline. Though weapon swapping would be problematic. It's just that neither the base ranger, druid or soulbeast sell the pet companion fantasy well so this would be a great oppurtinity.
---
My favorite dessert ruined by soapleaf. I will never level cooking past 400. D:
---
You realize if you are new you still have to pay for Living World Seasons 2, 3 and 4?
---
Wow who hurt you?
---
No idea why anyone would hate on your for that. Assassin is amazing.
---
I'm using Assassin in every slot and sitting at 79.38% crit rate with 100% ferocity uptime to 99.38%. So close to 100, but need some slightly better infusions to push it over.
---
Maybe for the spec utilities have them get kits, like an engineer. I don't think any other class has them so it might be a nice added dimension.
---
Basically 4 skills that, on activation, replace your weapon skills with 5 new ones that fit a common theme.
---
So for the big game hunter, I'm thinking a trapper's kit (hard and soft AoE CC), stealth kit (both to stealth the ranger and her allies as well as adding revealed to stealthy targets), lure kit (conditions on targets and buffs to self and allies), and medical kit (self and group heals, Condi cleanse, stun break, and defensive buff).
---
I think there has to be some sort of significant trade-off to get big damage and CC. Maybe not a rooted kneel, but something. Also if you're staying mobile, damage should be less than Deadeye, who's more fragile and giving up more to get those numbers.
---
Maybe for the whole class damage should be nothing much higher than a regular rifle spec, but CC would be the focus. Maybe they'd have to add a new CC effect that wouldn't be game breaking to add to the class. Maybe something that did break bar damage without interrupting or knocking down or anything? So your damage on trash mobs wouldn't be the "oh wow holy crap" of a Deadeye, but when you went up against that open world champ and you're breaking his bar every 5-8 skill attacks, you'd get a different kind of "oh wow holy crap".
---
Yes
---
Would much rather any visual abomination over the stupid level up animation, though to be honest there shouldn't be anything at all.
---
A german streamer / youtuber called kona opened 10k of those treasure hunt chests last sunday and he got obnoxious amounts of gold and loot. On average, the gold per minute isnt that bad
---
I agree. But Anet is dead-set on been different, so what do
---
1200 range power weapon for necromancer, preferably 2 handed.
---
Don't care what it is, I'll take hammer, longbow, trident - anything. So long as it's 1200 range and power.
---
On a note, and not to downplay the situation but, usually people who contemplates suicide and announce it just need some attention, to be listened to, they don't suicide.
---
Suicide is even more unpredictable and terrible because the person who wants to suicide just does it. Rarely if ever they announce it, and some times they even look like if life was ok.
---
Hammer Necromancer so they can actually use the Orr lego
---
Thank God the toxic players went to WoW classic.
---
This whole discussion is pointless. Is directing people to the sc website for builds good? If raid - &gt; yes
---
If fractal - &gt; still good but rather look at discretize
---
Open world: open world doesnt give a shit about what you're playing, but you can adjust the build for your skillevel and needs in terms of survivability and self-sufficiency.
---
Are RAID meta builds super shit unplayable in open world: no. Are they necessary to progress beyond open world: YES
---
Does anyone give a shit what you're playing in open world: no. 
---
In raids: yes.
---
Is it easy to change gear later: nah, its a hassle. Is it easy to adjust traits: yes, its fast and free. Same for skills. The solution is to encourage people to read what their traits and skills do while getting equipped in a way that doesnt become redundant later on
---
Absolutely; and I truthfully should have clarified that I was speaking more about the skill/traits aspect of the build in question. 
---
*Most* content that isn't WvW/PvP usually share the same few stat spreads (not including min-maxing for stat efficiency, which is an entirely different beast), with a small circle of runes that are commonly picked for specific roles; usually glassier stats. That's usually the first "endgame" lesson that most players hopefully learn by the time they focus on endgame gearing; glassier stats is usually better in PvE because active damage mitigation is reliable and readily accessible, and face tanking is detrimental in most cases.
---
However, this leads back to the initial discussion. I try not to actively recommend players to look at raid builds, but rather to compare and contrast them with a build for their targeted game mode; see what's similar and what's different.
---
Basic skins having 4 dye channels instead of 1 would be plenty.
---
it's reprehensible to make up a story about a suicidal person just to drive how 'friendly' one of the most toxic mmo communities is.
---
Having the option for easy-mode raids will kill the hardcore playerbase? What? Sounds like these "hardcore" players aren't at all hardcore.
---
They would put them behind uninteresting collections that play like ultra passive fetch quests intead of placing them as grindable rewards for instances and metas tho.
---
Basically, everyone, who doesn't have yet, wants Greatsword.
---
Well sure, I'd be happy to start a more in-depth discussion. The list only scratches the surface. I think what I mean is that the foundation/structures of GW1 allowed for more complex/varied gameplay and strategy. GW2 made a lot of bold changes to the genre, including the removal of strict roles (which I'm not convinced is better than GW1 roles in the end) and a new, fluid combat system (which I think feels better than almost every other game I've played in the genre). I think there's room for a better mashup of the two games that does put more emphasis back into pvp game modes. I also think a GW1-type game would do even BETTER in the current gaming landscape because esports are much more popular and other tools have improved (reddit, lfg, discord, etc.).
---
If people in this game wanted something hard and special they'd play raids. All they want is ez content and ez rewards and because of that we don't have almost any good anf exclusive rewards because Anet likes to reward everyone with participation rewards.
---
They are all equally toxic, just GW2 doesn't make you interact with people.
---
This makes me think about the [Frosty Dance](https://youtube.com/watch?v=9xZd3MW7OdQ) 
---
Videos. It was when guild wars was on its peak. This kind of stupid stuff is so important. 
---
If you focus on getting through the content as fast as possible, if you focus on efficiency, of course you run out of content.
---
It's not just zerkers only? What is this madness?
---
Known issue. Will be fixed on 17th https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1034295#Comment_1034295
---
It seems to me like a legacy server, running through season 1 at an accelerated pace, is the easiest way to do this.  But I don't know anything about the technical aspects of doing that.  I would happily install a 2nd version of gw2 on my pc to play this.
---
Ah, thank you! That’ll make farming much easier
---
Hey now, just because your genetics doesn't let you taste the awesomeness of cilantro doesn't make it bad, well maybe for you. :P
---
Yh just saw that now XD
---
I dunno. Strawberries are alright. At least it's not a cherry cake.
---
Since we are going into charr territory, maybe a Titan?
---
There's no real need to update from 1.7 to 1.7.1 if I don't use Win7, right?
---
And here I am, with zero KP.
---
A new first weapon, or at least dual melee focus on thief
---
Yeah, even if there was just an extra tab called “quests” in the achievements, that simply had a list of some of the more questlike achievements. I think it would be a huge step up.
---
I mainly just don’t like how much legitimately good content is hidden along with stuff like “Kill 1000 Bats” and “Beat Claw of Jormag without getting frozen”.
---
I haven't seen the video yet, but IMO Crit Capping only really shines in builds that have crit synergies. I'll watch the vid later and see what WP said specifically about Assassin's
---
I do agree with that tho, I wouldn't mind seeing a mount skin associated to a specific farmable item (kinda like making minstrel rewards you a music instrument), or rewarded for doing CMs (like celestial red)
---
Just not a "do this random collection on open world, talk to a bunch of NPCs, get a mount skin".
---
But I'm afraid having thoose "trophy" mounts would just.make the other gemstore skins less desirable. So at the end of the day, yes, I agree, but I can't blame them for not doing it either.
---
I hate that I'll never know the real taste that some people love!
---
There isn’t a sound effect as far as I know that accompanies condi cleanse that isn’t an attack or utility animation. Perhaps the “ding” you are hearing is when your endurance bar refills one tick? You can test this by turning up your UI sound to max.
---
Does it smell like soap too?
---
buy ascended trinkets, craft ascended weapons and use them to farm ascended armour
---
The reaction was maybe a bit of extreme, but generally I agree. The rewards are okay, treasure hunting kits are fun, the bounties are interesting. The keys give nice mats. The thing that makes PoF maps worse than HoT maps is the lack of of a Meta.
---
I agree. This is the last straw^(berry), anet
---
Tower of Nightmares could be made as a Raid or Fractal, and the Twisted Marionette could be a Strike Mission.
---
Tbh I don't know (for me personally.) I've only had cilantro a tiny handful of times, the last ones by accident since I hated it so much, so I never really smelled it. I'm also a little convinced my sense of smell is weaker than the average person.
---
Does this make the game look better? Please enlighten a noob
---
But if you take a break for, say, 6 months, you will still get those upgrades once you resub.
---
No. You can easily tell the difference between a 50 ess, a 150 ess and a 250 ess person, it's not "all the same".
---
Try to find their "max offer" then.
---
And occasionally , during your tp offer/sales check bump them again so they get barely any money from it :)
---
Damn beat me to it
---
Cool, I'm really keen to see your Ranger. I've been running condi Ranger/Soulbeast for what seems like forever; interested as you've said you're not focusing extensively on condis so I'm interested in trying something different just for the fun of a change.
---
This guy is the real MVP. 
---
Thank you for the amazing work that you have been doing for this game, megai2!
---
Yeah
---
Ah, a wild furnace defender has appeared. I know just the right thing to do.
---
So thanks for everyone responding. 
---
I said I'm using the EXACT same traits as the metabattle build, so no condi cleanse on those traits. It happens when I dodge roll without any noticable ICD, no food, against no specific enemy in particular, in different zones . . . At this point I'm just thinking something is bugged out on my character or something ( I do still have the skyscale revive effect bugged aswell although I completely done that step, doesn't go away no matter how much I revive xD, though that's unrelated I think ). I logged off to eat but I'll log back in a couple mins and check if it happens again.
---
In any community with a lot of people, there are bound to be people with issues.
---
&gt; A mount with quick horizontal movement.
---
Which would be different from the griffon and the raptor and the beetle how, exactly?
---
Ah. The Linus response:) Excellent work though!
---
Most of them are.  I think for alot of people I refer the mod to the term high end on the high end config doesn't describe what high end means.  Are we talking 2019 high end?
---
My personal experience from farming SW and Istan for hours a day... when someone says they think of suicide half of the map just says ‘same’ and continue with their day lol
---
Good Human
---
Implying everyone must be happy because you accept mediocrity is simply not true.
---
It's easy to change the stats of ascended gear.
---
Learnt by pugging.
---
It was amazing!
---
Once you get to the 100ess groups you never fail anymore!
---
Install any Windows updates if you haven't and fully shut down/restart your computer. Restarting generally returns the computer to a state where things worked before, so will work again.
---
Checking your wifi driver, if applicable, is also a good idea. Sometimes they have to be run in comparability mode if it's an older model.
---
Simple: If your rig can handle high end config it is high end'ish enough to be high end rig.
---
Some people taste soap when eating cilantro. It's a genetic trait. OP must have thought everyone knew this.
---
Its not instant to when you bid. Sometimes i bid then before it updates onscreen other bids are already there way in excess of item demand.
---
Personally, I craft clovers with the 10x recipe because the philosopher (1x) recipe takes forever to do.
---
An underwater mount. A crappy *free* mount for people who haven't purchased PoF to give them a tease of mounts. A multi-person mount. A mount that can hang and walk upside down inside caves. And they can always invent new mechanics that require you to have any other mount they want to make (granted this wont add much to gameplay).
---
I think there is room for at least the 3 first mounts mentioned.
---
Nope. I bought LW4 and can also buy LW2 discounted but not LW3.
---
GW2 is and will stay a casual MMO. If you want hardcore raiding there are plenty of great MMO's for that. Why can't people have one good MMO that they can play when they want, however much they want and not be forced to grind a hardcore gamemode. There are still plenty of ways to integrate cool rewards into such a game.
---
That was pretty much Jory's reaction.
---
My bf can see it on his promotions tab :( Weird.
---
I run at 250kp with a healbrand (plot twist: i AM the healbrand).
---
My runs are 100% no wipe and everything is as hard as a T1-3 rec (depending on the instabs). Why would i run qb? Sure it will save what, 2 minutes? If rather have a foolproof run.
---
JuSt LeAvE
---
"wheelchair setups" hahaha..
---
All that big pro runner talk!!! I'm totally impressed by your supreme skill at this very difficult game.
---
Maybe that's it. I only had PoF but got HoT recently. I hope they do extend it. A discount is a huge help when you're a new player!
---
For a huge chunk of the playerbase, it *would* be new content. If you joined in Season 3, like I did, there's this massive void left in the game. Season 2 starts with you talking about Scarlet constantly and I had next to no idea who it was. 
---
The reason many people want to do LS1 content is because we never did the first time round.
---
&gt;	Implying everyone must be happy
---
Which I never did, and in fact specifically said the opposite...but don't let what u actually said interfere with the great strawman you've got going!
---
For anyone wondering, somebody made a script for correctly linking Insights in chat in cause you actually wanna play lfg
---
The only toxic people here are the ones make posts like these telling others not to have an opinion. 
---
Truth is this game isn’t funded by casual players like yourself. I’d say at best that a tiny fraction of the players that log in a few hours here or there may contribute enough to support the game in perpetuity.
---
In reality it’s the very ones that are worried about the state of the game, that have become heavily vested in this game that support it. And yet you want to push these players away? Why? 
---
This is a business and Anet is failing to hold the attention of their customers. You keep telling everyone that voices complaints to shut up or get out but all that will do is push the game further into oblivion. The more people that leave, the less the game makes and the sooner the game gets pushed into autopilot or eventually shutdown. It already looks like it’s going in that direction with the silence, the constant delays they keep having, the automation they are trying to add to certain game modes, etc.
---
Once again why would you want them to reach this point sooner? People are upset because they care and know that there could be much more. When people get silent and stop voices their concerns then you should worry. The game has already been bleeding players for a while.
---
PoF has rewards????
---
We didn't really need the springer or jackal either. ANet can easily create environments where quick horizontal dashes could be useful.
---
Basically "it's really good". He goes through Berserker's, Assassin's and Valkyrie's as the three best open world gears. I still like Diviner's, though, because having 3 minutes of fury sitting on your character just feels snazzy.
---
Watching both videos and I'm glad I went off script for metabattle on my main characters. 90% of my gameplay is in PVE open world. Now, most of my playtime is on a warrior who already is decently tanky to begin with, but I carry a shield instead of an offhand axe because the extra CC and the block has been a lifesaver too often. I'll be fighting a champ or a boss or something and a whole bunch of circles pop up and I just block all the damage while I move out of the area. And I use strength runes just because sustaining 25 stacks of might is super easy on this build.
---
I am a bit disappointed that he doesn't think too highly of condi builds though. I won't pretend that my carrion stealthtrapper druid is the best thing ever, but she is awesome at clearing out large groups of enemies and not dying at the same time. I did the final battle of "A Bug In the System" last night and it's the first time I have ever done that fight without going into downstate.

This cake sounds fantastic, and now I must spend time offline trying to perfect it.
---
Gw2 community: Damn elitists dont let us normal players join in the endgame.
---
Also gw2 community: What is a create lfg button.?
---
Don't open that box with me... Too much memories :). Though it would be a bit long...
---
Mesmer longbow or riot
---
&gt;but don't let what u actually said interfere with the great strawman you've got going
---
Is that coming from someone trying to use his own experiences to prove me wrong?
---
You white knights keep getting worse and worse at this.

How about this  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Hooray and thanks!

I love these kind of builds. Looking forward to the series, WP!

Yes, but they're sorted fairly randomly. The elegy/requiem and astral/stellar collections are basically traditional quests on par with Knight of the Thorn, which is a side-story. It's all quite buried.

That still doesn't change fact that a lot of fb never touch their tomes.

Well, if they are trolling than at worst we got trolled and 'Oh, well!' fake internet victory for that guy. If it isn't a troll, at worst someone on their last leg has been ignored and the consequences of that are horrible.

Hi! This is untrue :) Most - if not all - of our emotes were handkeyed by our amazing animation team.

Well that sucks

They all do.

Look, I don't agree with the majority of the subreddit that the game is dying. But atm that's the majority vote so I just avoid the subreddit most of the time. Kinda like: if you don't like it just leave.

---
Been nervous about taking the plunge on this. All I ever hear is how buggy it is, and how much it crashes. Can I get a few of your opinions, you who use it?
---
There really isnt a hardcore alternative to gw2. WoW and Ff14 don't play anything like gw2.
---
OK, thanks for the quick reply.
---
I don't want exclamation marks, but if you look in the achievement panel and just see a spoon collection, you'll probably give up and not know about the storyline ones with multiple layers and dialogue. 
---
I genuinely didn't know they existed until LS4.
---
If Im using an old i7 6core 970 but a new gtx 1060 6g will this mod help with the bottlenecking?
---
My favorite self-stunning stun-breaking stun.
---
A masterpiece to be sure
---
Presuming you can switch any time out of combat, it’s likely to show an enemy player that you’ve done something.
---
Imagine calling somebody else an entitled child, when you yourself are having a [temper tantrum](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_4yDVKidRqA) when somebody criticizes the game fairly.
---
The PvE raid armor I guess? And the Ad Infinitum back piece.
---
If you don't mind me asking, why are you avoiding even WvW so much? You can get away with treating it like PvE content to farm for pips or do your dailies and get out. 80 potions from the dailies will automatically complete a track or you can math out how much time it will take to unlock a Gift of Battle track via pip farming.
---
I play warrior, do raids and fractals.. I will swap to axe+axe/mace+mace and banners for large PvE group fights against bosses (like bounties) but my preferred PvE build has
---
1) mobility
---
2) aoe bursts
---
3) stun break
---
4) 'become unblockable' (good for killing hard to hit stuff like scarabs in pof)
---
5) little more toughness
---
I run marauders gear, greatsword &amp; axe+axe.
---
Greatsword has excellent mobility with skill 3 and skill 5.  When in berserk mode you can press f1 3 times for 3 large aoe attacks and PvE has a lot of groups of weak mobs to kill.  You can also swap to axe/axe for axe spin if you want.
---
my other skills are: blood reckoning (fills adrenaline, resets f1),  signet of might (become unblockable), shake it off (stun break, also works on headbutt), shattering blow (reflect, extends berserk), and finally headbutt (cc, fill adrenaline).
---
So you have: heal, unblockable, stun break, reflect, cc.  All you could need for solo play.
---
My traits are: strength (121), discipline, (211), berserker (111)
---
 If you feel like the raids are a joke in terms of difficulty and you don't want to beholden to other people's schedules then realistically you should be able to start your own groups and clear the raids. Or is that not the case?
---
You know how some people don't see or acknowledge a problem until it starts to affect them directly?
---
Yeah, that's you.
---
Sale is over. If your bf has it discounted, he probably have some of the episodes unlocked so they are deducted from the total cost thus shown as "discounted"
---
Something that i always like to think of when people bring up the "mount skins as ingame rewards" debate is: think about our mounts compared to mounts from other games. Not only are our mounts way more interesting and differ strongly in their uses, no, we also get 8 totally different mount(skins huehue) for free because we have 8 distinctly different mounts. Yes, its not what people want but it is something that people easily forget. We dont have to farm shittons to change our skin from a standard horse to something different - no - instead we have a cool raptor a cute springer a floaty skimmer and so on. 
---
tldr yes more dye channels would be cool but for me perfeclty understandable that we wont get them and i think the default selection we get is already more than other sub-free games are willing to give
---
Hey gang! I've been beat to posting this project a few times (you speed demons), so I'm finally getting around to posting it myself. I am the organizer of the Collective (same people who did Tyrian Tarot and the Wintersday Zines). If you have any questions, I'm more than happy to hear them!
---
Tyrian Gazette by itself is an "in-world" magazine. The core idea is that you could pick this book up at any stand on the street, and read about the current news and trends going on in the world around you in Tyria. All ads, designs and articles are designed with that perspective in mind -- so we hope you'll come take a walk with us in the world of Tyria. :D
---
The project is live through tomorrow (Sept 10) at 11:59 PM PDT. While Indiegogo only takes Stripe (credit cards), we have a Paypal reserve set aside for those who need it. [**Please click here for the campaign!!**](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tyrian-gazette)
---
The project is sponsored by Guild Wars 2 &amp; is now guaranteed to donate $6,000 minimum to Extra Life!
---
I do. I'm just stating my personal opinion about how rediculous I find the 'hard core raiding' can get.
---
Posts like OP's are just as dumb as all the rant posts and people always such grand statements without any qualifiers to them
---
i.e. you feel like the game is in a terrible spot because of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
someone else might feel like the game is in a great spot because of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
and both of you will argue to the death about who is right instead of processing how you feel to have an actual conversation and instead just use each other as targets to rant at
---
Anet wont bother doing something against them since it only in their interest that prices of items are higher through them, since the earn more cash with people buying more gems for conversion. 
---
The best thing you can do is just avoid those items only find your niche or focus more into investing.
---
Yeah, I mean I get what they are going for, but I strongly disagree with their implementation.
---
&gt;Gen 1 flat out
---
Frankly, I just want a goal of something to work towards, more than the item itself.
---
Hahahaha
---
Don't give people hope..they gonna be dissapointed ..again!
---
Except in my experience for the high kill proof runs, its as smooth as a no or low KP. Human error is a thing at all stages. Its just a difference in where the errors are.
---
Usually the low runs fail early. So these players tend to be more persistent. High KP tends to fail later and give up after the first two or three runs. If it is early for High KP, they will lose one or two people and /gg it immediately.
---
Yep i'd really recommend more than 15-20% if you pug and still not comfortable, you're rarely get 100% alacrity when pugging and you can't trust the other support to perform well always so just have some extra diviner gear ready to swap if needed.
---
It's either you get a really good group that phases in 4-5s, or a bad group trying to be sNoWcRoWs and keeping up 40% quickness and 5 might/no fury.
---
The fact that raiders feel the need to ask for KP on bosses that can be cleared in greens shows you that there is a problem indeed ;)
---
It doesn't show proper meta at the moment but we are working on an update.
---
Are you telling us a PoF purchase couldn't have covered at least a few ingame mount skins? Is it that unreasonable to ask for ingame rewards in a B2P (not even F2P) game?
---
I still believe it's a project worth pursuing, even if it's over the course of 4+ years. They are so proud of their story, and people really deserve something akin to a full experience.
---
you can also play shout warrior as healer ...  doesn't mean you should...
---
TBH, I was waiting for somehting to take the place of the skyscale bitching
---
I am pretty sure you cant use it in a pvp match and in WvW it should not look like an level up
---
Been using it for months on my tower (gtx 770 and old i5 cpu) and no issues.
---
Also use it on windows install on a MacBook. No issues and only improvements.
---
I suggest you try it out
---
50 minute WP video is something great to wake up to.
---
You buy those codes from other people IRL, not through the store though (these are codes given away with the TCG or at conventions). Their limited number makes them valuable.
---
Not the same thing, really.
---
I'm coming at this from the other end of the spectrum: I love cilantro, but I'm indifferent on strawberries and hate cheesecake (which is really more accurately a pie anyway), so I was equally grossed out by this one as OP, but for the opposite reason.
---
I've been using it just recently, and it's been decent. The first time, stuff wasn't loading in right and I had a lot of blue or blank models. Still get those from time to time, but I think that's because I haven't loaded up the map since I got it. Afterwards going back to the same maps, I've noticed no blank models. 
---
But yeah, the fps increase is real, I noticed a 15-20% increase in my frames. Haven't tried out wvw with it yet though. I've had no crashes even when I leave the game on and go afk while I'm mass crafting materials. 
---
I say, give it a try. Run a meta or 2 with it on and see if you like it (try to do the same meta at least twice). If you don't, you can always uninstall.
---
This crap is honestly what made me quit this game
---
&gt; No idea why anyone would hate on you for that.
---
It depends entirely on the content ur playing in PvE. Open World I don't think anyone with a brain would hate on Assassins, because it get's you the closest to 100% crit uptime.  
---
In organized content like raids/fractals/dungeons you usually have buffs from other classes that get you to 100% with Berserker gear. Going Assassins in organized content wastes stats. Obviously no reason to hate on anyone, as Assassins is still better than Clerics, or other tank gear, but that's probably the reasoning behind it.
---
&gt; but new skin does nothing
---
I thought cosmetics were the endgame? So why are we downplaying their importance?
---
&gt; d912pxy is developed specially for performance
---
PC-noob here, so is this add-on of any advantage for a low performance PC which runs GW2 on low/medium graphic at most?
---
so are we happy with 2 maps , even with bigger replaybility like silverwaste for 1.5 year ? I personally think it will be horrible...
---
I thought the prologue was dropping Sept 17th, not November?
---
Yeah. Cilantro is disgusting.
---
Coriander tastes much better.
---
A 2-3 month cadence. If it comes on November 18th let's say or the Tuesday before that's 2 months.
---
&gt; Drakkar will try to be harder than previous world bosses, more akin to triple wurm
---
So it'll fail, a lot, because trying to get any sort of coordination out of random people that just show up is like trying to herd cats.
---
Prologue isnt episode one. Prologue in sep 17th, ep 1 in nov.
---
I love this idea.
---
so 1 hour play time every 2 months instead of 2 hour play time every 4 months ? Of course I am memeing a little here but then again how is that improvment? Where is the anet refocus? where is the content?
---
 **WARNING: USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!**  ^(because when you get used to it there is no turning back!)
---
Prologue this month, episode 1 in november.
---
I don't know, man.  I played GW1 from beta to sunsetting and was never really crazy about the quest log.
---
Ultimately I believe that the best approach isn't to focus on the semantics of Questing vs. Achievements, but to focus on usability and user experience (UX).  The GW1 system was nice because there was an exclamation mark indicator or something to do in the world, but the quest log itself was cumbersome.  In GW2, the achievements are more manageable because everything is searchable, but there's no in-world indicator for an achievement.
---
I'd love to see a blending of the two systems.  It'd be cool to see a visual marker somewhere in the world where an achievement can be earned.
---
Dry Top and SW are still very popular maps years later. Expandable maps don't have to be bad or less content.
---
I'm getting this after every map change... Already have 3 of them: https://i.imgur.com/kT7StKh.png
---
Chat link: [&amp;AgH4ZQEA]
---
Item ID: 91640
---
The best rewards one can consistently get are the 50 silver junk.  
---
One can get a few of them in little time and accumulate quite a bunch of coin, but since they are junk, they do not feel like a reward.
---
Another thing to note, not all self buffs appear on the hero panel for crit as well.  Theres a trait that gives crit on burning enemies for guard, it doesn't show in the hero panel.  Others are similar as well.
---
Thanks for the win7 support! &lt;3
---
And nothing is wrong with that, its not fun if you never lose.
---
Been working for triple wurm and most of HoT metas for a while, people can organize when they want to, you know. The powercreep helps a lot with that too.
---
Correct this its Mike Z who was interviewed for this no Mike O'Brien.
---
Looks like no dx12 on win8
---
That's correct. The prologue isn't episode/chapter 1.
---
Edit: Turn on sound &lt;3
---
Prologue releases next Tuesday hence it not being called episode 1. If you read a book the prologue comes before chapter 1
---
he said that episode 1 will come this year though. so maybe november or december probably.
---
At first was going to downvote but then...  
---
Sure. I don't have to buy them. Sure.
---
What have you done today since logging in
---
Acan's one of my favorite NPCs in the entire game.
---
"New episodes will take inspiration from LS1 and LS2, don't expect a new map every episode but one that can be expanded"
---
If this also means we get the less-rushed feel of LS2's story telling, im all for it!
---
It is. After the prologue, episode 1 of LW  The Icebrood Saga, will drop likely in November.
---
if they can overall give us more... so lets say instead of a big map every 4 months , we will get moderate map and after another 2 monhts it will expand with another moderate area, and overall we will get very big and replayeble map in 4 months I will get my words back.

Recent Achievement Quests like cooking do have such markers on the map and on top of NPCs heads
---
Wow, I must admit I was looking for something like that for a long time. I wonder how many gold per hour you will get in here.
---
&gt; Still, good to know raids are still happening.
---
Alright, more new assets made for &gt;5% of the community while Living World maps get recycled Black Citadel and more Path of Fire stuff.
---
it seems to be a bad joke that relies on an obscure genetic trait that most people have never heard of
---
I am fine with the contracts and keys. Contracts are basically the currency used for PoF maps. The keys I can actually run out on despite buying some using contracts occasionally if I am actively playing in PoF zones.
---
With the kits there is simply no chance I'll run into the spot I need to be while doing whatever else I happen to be doing. It would be better if they were more like SW shovels(but still keep the special action key mechanic instead of being a bundle).
---
I couldnt tell i always run HB. The few times i don't (because i miss my friends and end up pugging i play my trash tier DPS DH and noone seems to care about how bad i am) :)

Man I wish the rich node one was further down the list so my iron prices stay good

Ive done hundreds if not thousands of fractals.  Daily 50/49 runs for months.
---
What got broken this time?
---
Hello there,
---
so  I've come back to Guild Wars 2 after a couple of years of break, and I  see this, my bags full, my bank full. I cannot even pick up a stone, let  alone play comfortably. As all things Guild Wars, they all look shiny  and potentially important so I am afraid to throw away anything...
---
I assume 95% of these are trash.
---
I have no idea whether any of these items are worth anything, I don't remember which items are useful, and which aren't.
---
Should I sell most of these?
---
Besides,  my nick is Sicwolf.7549, if there's any group in Europe timezone that  wouldn't mind someone who'd like to stick but doesn't remember much  about the game!
---
Thank you all in advance!

Wow! Thanks for doing this! I always appreciate good data work!
---
Its possible to write your own interface to the API to see what price changes on things you are interested in and alert you if the price changes... get an alert do something.. people could be just doing this, or just have the TP window open as that's their niche item they are looking at.
---
Huh
---
Tower of Nightmares is a fractal and the marionette's mechanics were reused, with some much needed upgrades, for the Silverwastes vinewrath fight.
---
I am sceptical, I think people are forgetting that drytop even if fun is just a small map, few events here and there. So expending maps sounds fine but if we will get just a drytop level map for 8 months.. thats way less then 2 living world season 3 or 4 maps.  
---
As I said on other comments, if patches will be fast enough and we will overall get more it will be great.. but I am sceptical..
---
My friends and I have a running joke that started in Diablo III about beating the hardest content with only White gear. True gamers can do it no problem.

Enjoy.  I know I will.
---
As an example, Snowcrows' Power Holo build is fine for open world because of how quickly it kills things even without boons, while the Condi Engi is awful in open world because it takes too long to deal damage and is made of rice paper.
---
I dont know man, I replayed season 2 not long ago, there is content worth of 2 season 4 episodes there. And season 2 was going for over a year.. Its like 2 season 4 episodes for over a year! Thats almost nothing.
---
So, because our mounts are so cool, isn't it even more disappointing that all the 160+ flashy skins are not obtainable through specific gameplay but only through gemstore?
---
Type "/wiki" and shift+click any of the item to link it in chat and press enter. It will open the wiki page and show you the usage of the item.
---
Yes! GW1 class- and gender-specific dances are wild, check them out if you still haven't :D
---
I used to do a lot of pug raids, and you'd honestly get just as many experienced players looking to help as inexperienced players in training raids. Plenty of people want to help.

Has it ever been confirmed that these new sagas will be free content, and not something that must be bought separately? I know that LW chapters were only free if you logged in during them, and I assume these will be the same, but I haven’t heard anyone else ask the question.
---
Hammer for both Ranger and Mesmer.
---
yeah sad
---
Emotes as ingame rewards here in GW2.. Damn now I have a pipe dream.
---
Stay cool!
---
Anet has a bad habit of developing features that can't scale. By PoF they realized there were a LOT of currencies floating around. The key-ring they did (allow storage of a bunch more stuff in wallet) helped, but it's still a mess. I don't mind them consolidating map currencies, if there's good stuff to spend it on.
---
It's not about class, it's about skill level so play whatever you find comfortable and use a glass cannon build from metabattle.
---
What map did you load into?
---
Is there any intensive to upgrade from Free-To-Play account early on?
---
 I'm around level 11. I play Solo. So I don't whisper to people as currently I have zero friends at friend list :-) I don't use Map talk yet, and not using the Auction house as it's too early. Mounts and such are only access-able if I understand correctly on the expansions content and I won't get near it up until level 80. The only thing I can think about is the extra bag slot? and even that not a must. So - any reason why I should pick the expansions before level 80? or at least 50?
---
LFG be like "Looking for entry-level coders, must have five years of experience, 15 preferred, and have shipped at least two AAA titles."
---
I personally think more maps doesn't mean better.
---
Silverwastes is still played to date heavily.
---
Meh, you're using that as an excuse. I haven't played as actively since the whole null hash fiasco, but at least before that there were plenty of training raid discords and groups. Not every group should be expected to carry inexperienced raiders. Yes, some people learn the encounters with less practice than others. But the only metric pugs have to judge you on is KP. It's not a good reason not to play endgame content, since the resources to start are out there. You aren't entitled to every group being your training raid.
---
Oh I like these

In short, if you have decent specs, this will boost your fps and smoothness of the game by quite a bit.

dragonfall too so ? They were able to give good map even doing new map every episode. It just a matter of design and rewards. Not a time problem

White means black border?

And how do I know the item level? or by level 68 you mean every yellow I find AFTER hitting level 68?

So if item is worth more then 20 Silver to a Normal vendor, I should sell it instead on the trading post?

I currently playing Ranger, and I'm not sure which weapon I enjoy. In world of Warcraft I played Hunter - and had enough of Bows for a while. So instead I'm going melee. Im currently trying Great Sword :-)
---
Where's the lie?
---
for basic materials all the caches drop all types, the difference is in the tiers
---
Not every piece of content has to be designed for every player. If ArenaNet managed their resources better, they could cater to a wider crowd like other successful MMOs do. Different difficulty levels of encounters is a great example of that. Regardless, my main point is that your attitude results in the game bleeding players and a worse experience for everyone involved.
---
#"NOTHING CAN SAVE YOU!"
---
It also depends on what time of day you play. If you're on American servers and play during the workday you're going to find a proportionally higher number of people who don't/can't work or go to school for whatever reason. Same for in the middle of the night on a weekday.
---
In my experience when you're disabled you simply have more free time to spend on a game.
---
(This is proportionally, so it doesn't apply to everyone who plays during those times, but, you know.)

braham
---
The content are all the skins, the mounts, the gear, the achievements - basically everything you ignore to make your meme work.
---
It's probably safe to assume that all of these things will stay, while we also get strike missions and whatnot in addition to it. Plus whatever expansion-level features they develop.
---
It's not gonna happen and you know it.

---
If you exchange the life savings for 64 copper...
---
Raids get done on repeat for years.
---
Living story is a once done and dusted kinda deal.
---
----
---
Also most raiders probably wouldn't give a shit if they recycled Joko, Balthazar etc into raid bosses. Infact they would probably enjoy it.
---
While majority do open world, the amount that cares about new assets in open world is probably very slim.
---
Same here. I also lost one of my champion marks, so it's probably that.
---
Oh wow. 21$ is probably worth it for the support alone. And this is the path of fire version that comes with throns?
---
I think you are correct. I had one mark before logging in today, now it's gone and I have one "Trophy"
---
That's a great point to include but technically revenant is an expansion bonus and not a F2P restriction. If you owned the base game or heroic edition and had no F2P restrictions you still wouldn't have mastery, mounts, gliding, expansion story/zones, revenant, etc.
---
If you hover your cursor over an item it will display its name with a certain colour. Also, if you click on options within your inventory (cog icon) and have it set to show the items rarity, the color of the item's border will match that of its rarity.
---
To know the level of an item, hover over it. At the bottom of the window appears the line "Required Level: X", where X is its level.
---
No no. The Trading Post is like an "auction house", a market between players. The default keybind is "O", and then open the left tab that looks like some scales. If you want to check a specific item in your inventory, you can right click it and then "Sell/Buy at Trading Post".
---
Something that gives Quickness (Firebrand or Chronomancer), something that gives Might/Fury (Firebrand, Druid, etc), then 3 DPS or 1 BannerSlave and 2 DPS.
---
I wish anet finally realized that open world people have no clue and that trying to do anything in open world just leads to utter frustration for people who do. For exemple they should start with cutting (at least) in half all breakbar upscaling formulas ... And then not try to do TT-like stuff again.
---
I was looking forward Drakkar WB, reading this disappointed me.
---
Raids are endgame content that stay available for everyone. Noone is forbidding you to play too, if you dedicate enough time for it. 
---
I'm sorry not everyone caters to you all the time, but it wouldn't do any harm to you to live knowing that different people enjoy different things.
---
I wanna use it, but is it safe like arcdps, I mean, safe on the eyes of anet
---
If gw2 meta is cosmetics, and most cosmetics and cool shinnies come from the gem store, does that make it p2w?
---
You need a genuine shit-ton of ley-line crystals for machined/elite-spec weapons and for chak weapons too if you like those. I think some of the bladed armor pieces used to be really rare and you'd buy those for a lot of airship parts. Crystalline Ore (which is a map currency in all but name) is of course the one that has a truly hideous amount of sinks and has kept players in Dragon's Stand for years.
---
These rewards might not be cooler than PoF armor (although at least for Bounty Hunter, you don't even get the actual armor, just recipes) but they're more specific. I vastly prefer 1:1 matchups of content and reward. If I want bladed armor, I play Verdant Brink. If I want legendary medium armor, I play WvW for pips. If I want that Dhuum chair, I play Hall of Chains. I might not actually do that--I don't raid, and I rarely play WvW--but I can and these rewards make me want to. And sometimes, I do. When I play WvW, it is for WvW-exclusive rewards, namely the backpack or the medium armor set. And I've often done a Heart of Thorns meta specifically because I thought "if I do that meta and perhaps a few events on that map, I can progress this collection".
---
Trade Contracts don't fuel that desire, because they're not that specific. They don't drive me toward content and they don't make me want to play the game. They're just something you kind of accumulate in the background without thinking much about it. Even now on reddit, just writing about it, I kind of want to log in and get some ley-line crystals for another machined weapon. I haven't even really played the game in almost two months but they feel that rewarding.
---
whatch out for paypal ones later
---
It'd be nice to get some new fractals (that are not condi-vomit-skip-if-pugging clusterfucks) and not, say "our fractals team is working diligently to bring back slippery slope instability in a slightly less fucked up way, but will still be enabled in worst fractals possible". Cause both are "work", just not necessarily what average players want :)
---
that's fair, although for incoming new players who didn't own the game pre-HoT, the two conditions are one and the same, buying the expansions and removing the F2P restrictions.
---
I get what you're saying though, I hadn't even thought about that
---
Was the game running poorly on that rig without this?!! That’s a beast of a rig. Although not anywhere near yours my i7 1070Ti rig has more issues running GW2 well than it does with any other game. I’m really excited to try this mod when I get home later today. Hoping for a nice smooth across the board gameplay.
---
yes, all versions of Path of Fire now come with Heart of Thorns included
---
Oh, greatsword is great on a ranger. I'd recommend spirits if you want extra damage buffs or traps if you want, well, traps. The bleeding buff is handy, too. 
---
Axe is also a very good mid-range offhand weapon.
---
But they mostly came with fortnightly episodes. If LS5 (or LWS1 as they call it) comes back to ls1/ls2 frequency I'll be rly happy, but it's highly probable we'll have ls3 frequency with ls2 episode content ...

Is this real life?

I guess waht I meant is the pacing of the story felt better and less rushed, like how recently we went on a wild balthazar chase then lazarus was done and over with instantly when he deserved way longer to shine. I feel the same about joko and kralk tbh, i feel like joko should have been an entire season to really not rush things but thats just me wanting everything to be fleshed out like a singleplayer game in an mmo which sadly isnt easy.
---
Get an account on gw2efficiency and you'll find everything you're missing for crafting it as well as find the cheapest way to do it.
---
Which is why I advocate for raid academies to make learning statics where members commit to a set group on a set schedule with a few mentors rather than the revolving door.
---
That way you screen people for preparedness (watch them perform on a golem before even considering trialing them), and without a revolving door of pugs everyone progresses more or less steadily instead of wasting the whole group's time trying to bring the few new people up to speed.
---
Obviously you have to set standards for participation, but setting the standard to "have it cleared twice before" is a pretty poor way to maintain a vibrant raiding community, and it shows.
---
Granted, there are multiple factors. For one, Anet doesn't give a rat's ass about instanced PvE content or a proper PvE rewards structure, that much is clear given the content cadence. This results in an emphasis on open world PvE with no standards of performance making up the majority of the content, and it snowballs into a community of mediocre players since incoming players are never really asked to understand on improve on their class when all you have to do is show up in large numbers and autoattack something to death in most of the game.
---
But if people are going to moan about the pool of players in the raiding community, they also have to look inwards and not expect that a raid community can self sustain just by either friends carrying friends into clear status or making it a scene that favors early adapters of the content before the kp cutoffs start ballooning (I was there when 100 cm released and was one of the first to clear, so I benefited from early adapter status; at first, it was just archdiviner title, then LNHB -- fair enough, then 30 ess, then 6 months later coming back from a break it's 100 to 250 ess, it gets stupid).
---
You can check [is there any deal](https://isthereanydeal.com/search/?q=Guild+wars+2) for deals but DLGamer should have other region options too (see if you can select your currency in the upper right) or you might be able to use something like PayPal to bypass the restriction
---
&gt;They will try to do releases faster rather than 3~4 months.
---
Not the first time we've heard this
---
I mean... silverwastes isn't played because it's fun. It's played because you can run in a circle tagging trash to get decent gold income with almost zero effort. Anet could manipulate the reward payout of almost any map to achieve similar results.
---
Idk why ppl love exploration so much, i prefered the se2 format of maps evving and staying relevant longer.
---
You dig it!
---
offhand sword theif
---
Oh goddamnit. Any fixeroni?
---
Can you use greatsword for dps as FB? I just made and boosted a guardian last night but I seriously know next to nothing about them, I just really wanted a greatsword class and they seemed fun and interesting with their mix of healing abilities or other forms of nice utility for a group
---
Thank you, I got it from Gamebillet for 2 more dollars. Worth it :-)
---
That's mostly because TT gives shitty drops compared to the effort spent, if they scale the rewards according to the difficulty (and that's a big IF), I bet people will still do it even years later.
---
Less but bigger maps is better imo even if it is just so they can do less work. The current LW formula results in a bunch of nearly dead maps. It would be preferable if LW maps can stay relevant for a long time like the silverwastes has.
---
This.
---
Just adding, I just reached rank a few days ago and I'm facing hugh queue times, much more than what I see on streams.

Maybe it's bacause of low rank? I've switched back to unranked for the time being, as I have little time to play. Will try again when I rank up more.
---
An incentive to remove lootboxes or be labeled as "18+; contains gambling" would hardly be the industry-crippling death knell to all microtransactions you seem to be expecting.

In fact, I'm warming to the idea of banning them altogether. 
---
If the primary value of your digital product is the *chance* of getting something, that's gambling.

Outfits, mail carriers, skins, living world season unlocks, bank tab unlocks - all of these are demonstrably different from black lion chest keys. You exchange the gems, you unlock the thing.

Meanwhile the black lion chest key costs 125 gems and its only guaranteed payout is 1 black lion statuette. 1 statuette is worth much less than 125 gems according to the statuette vendors.
---
Yes, it would impact Hearthstone and MTGO and MtG Arena. And many other digital card collecting games (Hearthstone and MtG Arena aren't actually considered 'trading card' games under most interpretations, as the cards cannot be traded).
---
How about this then: If the content unlocked by a purchase is not fully listed prior to purchase or the items within that list are not guaranteed to be received by the customer, then the minimum that the customer can receive in exchange for their purchase is an amount of cash shop currency equal to the cost of an additional, identical purchase, also subject to the above minimum requirement. Products inconsistent with this will be labeled online gambling and their storefronts will be regulated as such.
---
If your business model relies so heavily on getting people to pay for the chance at one of your products that you'd go out of business if people started being informed that you are, in essence, a casino with a maximum payout of $0, you shouldn't be in business in the first place.

Is there a painless, guaranteed way of doing suicide that the average, non-mechanically oriented person can do?  I found one drug that is supposed to be painless and always works, but getting it is extremely hard.  The warning being that you can find it online but they are sites just trying to get your money and send you nothing or fakes.
---
Ideally (besides being painless and guaranteed), it should be easy.  When one is in the level of depression where they would do this without question or fanfare, they need it easily accessible.  The depression can be crippling and make doing things extremely hard.  
---
As for painless, it's important to clarify that  while jumping from a plane or shooting a bullet through your head may seem painless, it's hard not to imagine the pain of it even if it lasts but an instant.  You don't want that last instant of your life to be of pain.  Additionally, taking your life so graphically can just make a person scared even when they are serious and ready to end their own life.  Being a coward in this respect can be a serious obstacle.  That's why a quiet and painless method like pills (not sleeping pills of course which don't work) has appeal.
---
But mainly, what's painless, guaranteed, and accessible to the average person (for people who are not mechanically oriented enough to build masks and other devices)? 
---
If you have an answer to this but don't feel comfortable sharing it publicly, I understand completely, but would very, very much appreciate you sharing it privately with me for my own personal knowledge.  Thank you.
---
Orrr... You can check Youtube guides, get a correct build and PUG making your own team.
---
When i started i had little to no KP req and still many 200+ players joined.
---
It does. Up to 120fps in places and running most things high (except for character count etc since I don't really need that)
---
They're just on this subreddit now. :)
---
Adding flavor and value to junk rewards was a good move. They have continued that in black lion chests.
---
You know the oldschool condi engineer build with all kits and healing turret? Playing this exact build since 2014 when I switched my main from ele to engi. It blows everything away damage wise, has good healing capacity by blasting big bomb, flamethrower's 2, orbital strike and explode heal turret, also some condi cleanse and lots of cc, combined with good blind and some might generation by blasting fire fields instead of water. Not to forget the ability to stealth with smoke bomb blast and quick change to scrapper for sneak gyro...
---
But WP already stated he is not showing condi builds or really complex builds and remembering skills on 4 kits + your normal weapon skills is definitely complex even if you don't have to do the perfect condi engi rotation in normal pve.
---
I'm still shocked that the reaper was the first to drop, honestly.
---
I don't agree with the "meta" mentality. All characters should be able to get through an encounter.
---
There are only 12 blizzard store mounts out of 700+ obtainable in the game.....
---
Or through raids, which is how I obtained mine and far faster than you do in GW2, and out of achievement of hard content, instead of knowing some mongo afk farming Silverwastes can't get the same mount a raider had to put effort into earning.
---
Is an i5 8400 and a GTX 1060 (3 giga vRam) considered having good specs for this? Oh also single channel RAM 8 gigiabytes at 2400 MHz
---
He really slaps the bAss
---
Yeah but that's the point about raid builds in general. Only a small number work in open world, most will either be frustrating or get you killed.
---
conmdi engi in open world awful? read my post here  https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d1q75v/woodenpotatoes_best_builds_for_standard_guild/ezqfyx9/

---
we will have news on wvw in the upcoming months
---
It means you need to drive slower with your beetle.
---
In all seriousness what does the tool tip say?
---
For warrior, you’ll want a berserker with axe/axe and gs
---
[Build from metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Berserker_-_Power_DPS) 
---
Great dps, good cleave especially with gs, good survivability.
---
For dh, use the normal dps build.
---
[From snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/dragonhunter/power/) 
---
Amazing dps, great cleave, super survivable if you know how to play the class well.
---
For ranger, power Slb will be best.
---
[snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/) 
---
Amazing dps, good cleave, good survivability.
---
Necro is great with power reaper.
---
[snowcrows ](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/reaper/power/) 
---
Great dps, amazing cleave, great survivability.
---
Ignore assassins pieces and just get full exotic berserkers, superior rune of vampirism, and a superior sigil of air in each weapon set. This is a nice budget gear set for the best bang for your buck.
---
With story stuff, you want to play what you enjoy. It get boring quick if you’re not into story. 
---
From easiest to hardest, it’s probably reaper, berserker, dh, then slb. 
---
Berserker is probably the most fast paced, with the possibility of camping axe if you’re lazy.
---
Dh has the highest boss dps and best active defenses. Insane utility and alternate skills as well
---
Slb is difficult to pick up, but shreds hard and has decent utility.
---
Reaper is brain dead easy, super tanky, but still great dps. Kills everything around you at once.
---
All are great choices. Depends on which you like.
---
*edit: also you might consider if you want to use this character for other content. Each class is viable in different areas, whether that be wvw, endgame pve, or pvp.
---
The real question is how does he manage to play two guitar parts at once with only three chubby fingers?
---
As long as it's not "These things must all die at the same time".
---
I hate that mechanic in any fight, it's fucking cancer.
---
my best guess is champion mark may be
---
&gt; Raids are endgame content that stay available for everyone. 
---
As someone who raids, I laughed that you could say this with a straight face.
---
So this only affect the game you install it next to in its root folder? It wont mess up any other games on your system? Sorry for the dumb question
---
What I want to know is why you and so many other people seem to know what soap taste like.
---
Got this item, don't have the champ mark anymore. Sounds true to me.
---
For me condi has some charm. There is something inherently cool in puting some skills on a mob and just walking away knowing that it will die.
---
no, because we get 8 unique and distinct skins by default its understandable that everything else is in the gemstore :&gt;
---
A few pieces of armour, maybe a weapon or a gizmo, and an upgradable, full set of armour for all three armour classes. Yes. And there are people that enjoy achievements. Don't dismiss content just because it's not your taste.
---
[Did I do it?](https://i.imgur.com/n0kn9F2.png)
---
Disagree completely.
---
My point is, the example item isn’t showing the behavior you describe.  So you were likely competing with someone equally/more aggressive than you on it and they are now offline.
---
I don't know, but the champion marks were for the community event thing that ended
---
No reason not to. Living World has grown and grown and grown for seven years straight. From Season 1 to 2 to 3 to 4. Sagas are the logical next step.
---
Rule of RPGs: Do not question the bard.
---
&gt;oldschool condi engineer build with all kits and healing turret
---
Bro that's not oldschool, that's the meta for Engi in raids. It's not "bad" in open world, per se, it's bad in comparison to other things that can kill more quickly. Engage your holoforge and press 4 and things die. Or play P/P Thief and press 3. Or any number of classes and builds that pump out damage faster.
---
Not sure but if it is any consolation you were being downvoted by people who at some point in their life decided soap was something they should try to eat. How else would they know what soap taste like? Although maybe they just watched too many cartoons and thought they could start burping up bubbles ....
---
So Tldr: gw2's future is mild and mild accessories..
---
great research, even though i dont farm to get gold.
---
probably worth noting that magic find could affect your personal mileage by quite a bit.
---
might be interesting to check one farm on different magic find stats, like 300 %, 500% and 750% (assuming you already have around 300% base mf on your account and cant go lower) and compare the results.
---
don't listen to this guy all it takes is a rev to come flying at him to end his whole career. dead eyes are easy to counter and are really only threats to necromancers and anyone not paying attention. a thief decapping is till more useful than a dead eye, Remember thief isn't meta shortbow 5 is.
---
Not poorly but not as good as modern games.  I run on a 4k 120hz monitor.  BF5 still gets a higher FPS than GW2... The mod certainly gives an FPS boost.  It's rare I drop below 60 fps in even the biggest wvw Zerg fights.
---
You might exp some flickering and missing graphics on character portraits, but well worth the FPS boost.
---
Adding more effects to the effect monitor would add more clutter on top of all the fluff it already has. 
---
So first we could use removing as much clutter as possible, by putting all non-combat effects inside a single stacked effect. When you hover the mouse over it, it would show a list of all the non-combat effects in it. Leaving all the space for only combat effects.
---
Then we'd have room for trait effects in the effects monitor, showing the cooldown of traits.  
---
For sigils, they could be put inside or on top of the weapon swap/drop bundle button as 4 circles. The current two sigils would appear with the normal color, and the sigils in the other weapon set would be shown darkened next to them. 
---
The sigil icons would get a border indicating the time when they are in cooldown, or a number if they are a stacking effect.   
---
For elementalist and engineer, they would still appear in the spot, they would just not get the weapon swap button under them until they grab a bundle, and they would be 2 diagonally instead 4 side to side. 
---
Rune effects would still appear in the effect monitor as some already do like monk and thorns runes, since they always have just 1 active effect. And the effect would also be added to all other runes with an effect with cooldown, like those that trigger on elite or heal skill use.
---
Looking to kickstart my account back up once again. Have been playing on and off since release - so I kinda know what I'm about.
---
From time to time I like to delete all my characters and "start over". If your goal was, to get all classes equipped, back up to lvl 80 and ready to rumble - which class would you suggest starting up first?
---
Looking for something that can be quite easily geared, is liked in Fractal pugs and decent in solo open world. Any opinions ?
---
you can also make similar things using stuff derived from various polysaccharide like agar, pectin, various starches

It took me so long to figure out that I had to glide up to him in order to get him to talk to me. I just sat around him listening to his songs for like 10 minutes and honestly didn't mind at all.
---
i didn't kill because there is no reason to do it
---
I made Bolt a few months ago and I found it fairly painless. In my opinion, Legendaries are about the journey, not the destination and I enjoyed the process enough that I *might* make another Gen 1 legendary. The idea of grinding the gold to make a Gen 2 just puts me off, honestly. 
---
The main hurdles were time-gated materials and trophies. 
---
If you make a daily habit of making the time-gated stuff, charging quartz and doing one or two of the metas, you'll chip away at it very quicklu. I found that the price on gw2efficiency didn't reflect the "real" price as it went down by 20-60g a day, depending on what I did because the trophies and mithrillium stuff take up such a huge chunk of the cost and you're generating them yourself for minimal work. 
---
Do the more generous LS4 map metas and buy trophy shipments with the LS4 currencies as you need a lot of the T6 trophies. This literally paid for itself as I sold the surplus. You can be more efficient and use the mystic forge to upgrade trophies as well. Istan and Dragonfall are still top of the line for farming, but mix it up a bit to avoid going mad. 
---
It's a bit boring, but you can get into a rhythm with it and some people run trains where they hit 7 metas in two hours and it works out nicely. 
---
Amalgamated crystals are worth a bit of money, too, and again LFG farm trains happen regularly enough. PvP and WvW can be lucrative for both map currency and liquid gold. 
---
Also, sell "bank junk" - you have a lot of crap you don't need in your bank, I guarantee it. Make a gw2efficiency account and look up Twilight and see what you need, then look at what you have and what you can sell. A lot of the orbs, gems and things are probably useless and lots of them sell for a lot.
---
Did you just install the dx12 thing?  If so that’s probably the issue, it seems to (or at least used to) show some odd things on that screen, in game after you run around a bit in things should look normal.
---
Don't forget the smoke field and the poison field. Toxic foes have the downed state and get revived. Drop the poison field on them. Smoke field = free stealth to set up a stealth attack. 
---
d/d and sb set up some real nice bleeds.
---
Dredge are a pain and are immune to blinds.
---
Thanks!  👍
---
TT gits killed daily on EU. Not sure about NA.
---
Oh no coordination^^
---
I remember gliding for the first time. Basic gliding in the trees in Verdant Brink. Changed the game.
---
I can’t believe people are saying to use raid builds after this video and your comment. Who wants to run around being a glass cannon in seeker gear all the time? Hell, there are classes that people don’t even want in their raid or others that make no sense to play PvE with. Raiding community go away you’re drunk!
---
Oh boy, that's gonna bit a little bit. I'm glad this can help. I think the hardest thing will be to find a group that will help with the events since Griffon has been out for quite some time. Which reminds me..I gotta calculate Desert Highlands at some point..
---
Thanks! Yeah LS4 maps are suuuper great and easy to get into. The easiest would be to hop into a LS4 meta train since there are some commanders that run those daily. Check the LFG every now and then for those
---
Double Shield.
---
Wow, really?  I just redid S3/PoF last month or so, and I don't recall either Marj or Kas looking that detailed in game.  Maybe my graphics settings, but then rip during metas/wvw.
---
This is positive. I'm not holding my breath, but this is positive.
---
It's sad that we have to rely on data miners to get new information about the future of the game.
---
Nope, it has nothing to do with difficulty tiers.  It has to do with LFG-makers only wanting people who have already done the raid a number of times.  They think it'll guarantee their chances of getting no """noobs""" in their group.  In a way they kinda want to be carried
---
Hahahaha I think we'll be okay. Those node farms have been the top since release (I have no data since then but I've always made money off of it). Thanks!
---
They said they want to do something exciting every month and E1 will come this year. Since October and December are taken by Festivals the guesstimate seems rather accurate.
---
Toadilly shredding.
---
It's a bit misleading. In order to receive the novelty item from the Black Lion vendor, you need to have purchased the Outfit Container from the gemstore (this is called a gemstore package).
---
Unlocking just the Outfit (without having bought the package) won't actually give you the Axe Toy.
---
(FWIW, I randomly unlocked the Witch's outfit a while back + just checked whether i could get the broom for free - i could not.)
---
The last time they tried to do every two weeks was 2014 and they told us this burned out the content teams.
---
What you're shedding light on is not in any way meaningless.  Hell, it's one of the biggest reasons why nobody plays/played PoF maps.  The metas in PoF didn't even give amalgamate gems until very recently...  Also, the problem with treasure maps is that they drop way too frequently for how much time investment you have to put in in order to use them all up.  And it's an incredibly repetitive process, too... not fun in any way lol
---
It's no secret that Arenanet doesn't like to adequately reward their players for playing the game.
---
Yes it's with the volatile tools. I have the Glyphs, but if you don't want to invest in hundreds of gold for them, you can always buy the karma Volatile Magic tools from these vendors:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Volatile\_Harvesting\_Sickle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Volatile_Harvesting_Sickle)    
---
And yes I convert volatile into gold by buying shipments. The conversions of how I got their worth is in the subsheet labeled "Worth Data" if you want to see the proof
---
You love him now, but it turns that when every elder dragon died he actually absorbed some of their essence as well, and he will be the next dlc’s main antagonist.
---
I love those ideas!! I enjoy the PoF maps way more than HoT (with the exception of AB). Having your suggestions added would be a great way of using those treasure maps. Which I have done precisely 1 time because i chased about, found it, opened it and just sighed. :(
---
Just gonna copypasta my response to why I'm not making my own groups, since yall sociopaths have no empathy and can't understand that other people are different than you:
---
&gt; Because people have skills and knowledges that they're personally comfortable with sharing and also may not be related to the problem they're currently trying to solve. That's why. I don't have leadership qualities, I don't have the confidence to run the content, nor do I wish to bother learning any of it until I know I can get my foot in the door because I'm probably going to forget it all if I learn it now and actually get in my first pug raid 6 months down the road.
---
A bit sacrastic but
---
&gt; Our current priority is to try to have something exciting for every month in the game.
---
* January - February  - Lunar New Year
---
* March - April - SAB
---
* June - July - Dragon Bash
---
* July - August - Festival of the Four Winds
---
* October - November - Halloween
---
* December - January - Wintersday
---
Which leaves May and September for **new** content.
---
I've been waiting to leave the 1 map per release meta behind since it arrived. Shipping a map ever time has dominated the release structure to the point where in early season 3 70% of an initial playthrough of a release was doing hearts and exploring the map for the first time. The repeatable aspects were usually the same. This gave very little wiggle room for other and more interesting content. Leaving this behind is an awesome decision.
---
That's right..I did forget to mention that I have a base magic find of like 300-320 (I can't remember on the top of my head). It would be interesting to see what kind of increase it would be to have more magic find. It's just too bad that if I try to redo the benchmark with much much higher MF, it would be hard to replicate the same events, timing, etc etc.
---
Not fun either if you lose over things you have little control over.
---
Uncalled for and far from reality, but I guess a logical consequence of festival fatigue after War Eternal.
---
As far as I heard, some people got on a sick leave due to permanent crunch, that was involved with such an unrealistic release cadence.
---
[deleted]
---
[Yup, it's pretty great.](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand)
---
Best to doubt and discredit everything the developers say at this point because it's so much more cool and edgy to believe the devs hate us and are going to abandon every game mode.
---
I mean, yeah, they didn't mention it at the announcement, which was a miss, but there is nothing vague about this statement.
---
A tech test using recycled bosses surely isnt necessarily representative of future content sharing barely anything than the matchmaking system
---
What does the Baubles tag mean for Kessex and TD?
---
As a casual player I never found the cadence to be too painful.  We basically got 1 big patch a quarter with new maps, story, and things to do (meta).  Honestly if they do new stuff every other months its just slightly quicker so not much is changing.  I think it's funny they say monthly and then include all the holiday stuff that takes no additional work for them since its all on a schedule and recycled.  They really mean every other month lol.
---
You opened your Silverwaste loot on a level 80 character which nets an average 1.60s per material. If you opened them on a level 50, you would net an average 4.94s per material. That is 334% more gold.
---
Sorry if I misunderstood you. I read 'a bit sarcastic' but I thought you might have also been making a point, because of the 'a bit' part.
---
F
---
This is a huge sigh of relief for me, considering I spend most my time and effort only in raids. 
---
Repeatable rewards for CM would be godsend. However, given how they have toned down a lot of rewards recently, I feel like it may end up not being worth the effort.
---
It's from a song I wrote for my high school/college ska band. :)
---
Oh, so NOW they remember Marjory and Kasmeer exist.
---
Are we going to ignore the profitability of the maps when doing the comparison? Because people here are talking as if Silverwastes is this super fun map to play, but for the most part of its history it was about running in circles digging stuff from the ground, profitable but nothing to write home about in terms of fun.    
---
If we get a similar battlefield type of map, but snow themed and against the icebrood, it could be great, but let's not forget that in order to fully explore what meant going into the dragon's territory, we needed to have an expansion.
---
how can someone say season 2 was better then anything as it is one of the more sad times in this game
---
Have you considered using Glyph of the Crucible on the unbound and volatile nodes? You still get the mat (ie difluorite crystal, primordial orchid, etc) and the magic currency, but instead of bloodstone dust, dragonite ore, and empyreal fragments, you get mithril ore, elder wood, or t5 plants (if the node required a mining pick, you get mithril, axe gets elder wood, sickle gets plants).
---
Its not much, plus you miss out on the extra magic from the unbound/volatile magic glyphs, but i think it could make petrified wood and primordial orchid farming worth a good amount since elder wood is worth more than mithril and plants
---

---
Having a new map with each episode was something that only started with Season 3.  If they go back to the Season 2 formula, this means they don't have to pour so many of their resources into big new maps every single episode, instead just expanding on already-existing ones.  Just think of how e.g. Domain of Kourna is so utterly lacking in interesting things to do.  Trust me, this is going to be a much more positive and healthy step for the game.
---
Afull dps dh can prestack 30sec of quickness while reaching ridiculous dps levels.
---
I am fairly new to GW2 (\~ 3 months) and am always looking to improve. So far I play Open World only, it's what I enjoy. Recently went on meta battle and started using a build billed as being for Open World. Died constantly. It felt to me like that was all about imposing conditions and not doing dps. And it wanted me to use sceptre and staff, both of which feel very slow to me and I just don't like the associated skills.
---
I took their advice regarding the trait trees and I can see an improvement with my "F' skills for sure. But I got rid of the 6-0 they recommended and went with stuff that kept me alive. 
---
I have only watched half of this vid so far and I am *so excited.* It sounds like this guy is going to focus on things that are important to me in Open World and I can't wait to see what his recommendations are. Based on this alone he will have 1 new sub today.
---
Too many people seem to overlook how varied open world PvE fights really are.  A lot of it can be lost in lack of overall difficulty, but fighting the Forged is very different from fighting Awakened, vs Branded vs all those vile Elonian plant mobs, White Mantle, Icebrood, Mordrem... They all have a style that can get nasty real fast with the right mix of mob types and numbers.  
---
It's one of the things I really appreciate about open world.
---
Yeah, I blame ANET for a problem unique to their MMO. Doesn't excuse raiders for helping kill their mode.
---
Not quite. I have a very good life. I want for nothing, and my folks love me a lot and help me. But I have had thoughts. I'm on meds now after talking to my parents, which I've noticed enable me to actually feel happy about something as simple as good weather. Not all the time, mind you, I'm not some happy-go-lucky fool (I also cry over d'aww manga)...but it let me notice how terribly neutral and disinterested and robotic/zombie I was before I got on the meds.
---
I'm hoping to be off the meds in the future. But sometimes there is something as simple as a chemical imbalance. Anyone contemplating should step back and look into seeing a psychiatrist. They will help. It isn't you as a person that has something wrong, at least no more than anyone else on the street :p
---
Yeah this game's always had that level of detail.

If the new maps are as good as Silverwastes and Dry Top, I‘m honestly fine with that. I feel like the new maps added not that much in terms of interesting metas or unique events. I rather have them release a great map with tons of repeteable content every 5-6 months than a map that feels like you‘ve completed it in one day.
---
I actually managed to get all the events and items down already! And I'm over halfway the gold mark, just need 100G to move on to the Sunspear Wisdom collection. I'm just *terrible* at making gold lol, so this helps!
---
They also didn't mention the upcoming WvW/PvP changes during the announcement, but realized their mistake and made a forum post.
---
This... is treasure!!! Are you going to update the sheet after every patch or what?
---
Considering those just filled out the remaining weapons, I'm led to believe that's for build templates.
---
Most of the raid builds are perfectly fine. Power chrono, dh, condi fb and reaper are incredible solo. All you have to do is maybe slotting a strenght sigil or taking sword on dh for fury.
---
It wasn't the primary selling point until the last few years. Wasn't when I bought in.
---
I would look it up myself but the trophy doesn't have a name :(
---
I am with you on this one. Even if they released new endgame content (fractals/raids) in the future, the thought of dusting of all my played-to-death classes and specs bothers me, wish I could explore new content with new play styles.
---
Why would you buy new skins if you already have one?
---
Even if it was 1% it would still make a lot of players not want to buy a new skin because that one is "just enough".
---
Never question the bard, ever.
---
You agree that condi is worse in open world but yet disagree that raid builds don't work in open world. That makes no sense, but you do you.
---
Even better (or worse), NOW they remember those exist when they're supposedly releasing content oriented towards Norn and Charr.
---
Outfits...you got that right.....
---
I hope they do :)
---
You could look up in one of the 5 threads below.
---
I can’t decide if the name checks out or not...
---
Most ele builds will feel slow on dps with that. Effective for stuff like WvW or Fractals where more defensive stats are worth something, but lackluster in open world.
---
The weaver burn build does do alright with cele gear though.
---
https://imgur.com/a/cX1r25s :D

Probably because that requires very significant time investments that most people would rather spend doing other things. You need to farm SW for however long it takes to get a decent amount of bags, you need to have a character slot open for a level 50 character, and then you need to stack magic find on that character, and then spend half an hour playing Inventory Wars 2.
---
Personally, I would much rather be running around killing stuff.
---
Most raid builds have more damage without boons than some of the boon builds with diviner and full boons because they dropped strong modifiers and stats for 5might stacks or something similar.
---
Oooh, the [Shiny Baubles](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shiny_Bauble).  Got it, thank you!
---
The icons are nowhere used apart from the specilization traitline icon. There are different icons in the gamefiles for weapontypes. Those are specifically/exclusively used in elite specs. It's a possibility that they are for buildtemplates, but unlikely. They are most likely in my opinion, in case they are ever gonna make elite specs with those weapons.
---
Content since HoT has been a lot more challenging, but you can still invalidate any of that challenge by having a group. Lots of people just rely on groups to get through stuff.
---
&gt; Yes, but they're sorted fairly randomly. 
---
I agree, but at least you know where you can find them. You know that astral/stellar collections are part of Daybreak, so you know you can find it in the Daybreak category. Knight of the Thorn is part of the side stories and so on.
---
I think taking them away from their categories only to put them into a "quest journal" with basically the same categories (or they would be even less sorted) would only be more confusing and end up in a mess.
---
Warrior - Paragon - Uses staff as a throwing spear - Consecration skills
---
Guardian - Apostle - Warhorn weapon - Incantation skills
---
Revenant - Warlock - Scepter weapon - Sorcerer legend
---
Ranger - Plainswalker  - Mace weapon - Conjure skills
---
Thief - Fortuneseeker - Torch weapon
---
Engineer - Maestro - Focus weapon
---
Elementalist - Spellslinger - Uses pistol to shoot magical projectiles - Mantra skills
---
Necromancer - Demonologist -  - Phantasm skills as demons
---
Mesmer - Bladedancer - Dagger weapon - Trick skills
---
Nice idea, but sending links ingame is even more annoying.
---
Yeah... I made this account a little over a couple years ago when i was addicted to gw2. I’ve clocked over 5k hours in this game, but i understand the downvotes i get on this subreddit.
---
Ah thanks for the clearup, I just know those posts were set to public shortly after the announcement. (I hardly use the forums myself.)
---
Yeah, I wish they talked about the entire future of the game, not just living world, or at least talk a little bit about what's to come, because frankly.. a new armor set isn't content. (IMO)
---
What is a screenshot?
---
Condi is worse because open world trash dies so fast that power is just better.  Raid builds work fine in open world.  Not sure how it makes no sense unless you are saying Raid builds = condi builds but w.e, this convo is clearly going no where so "you do you".
---
Makes sense. Gotta go for the troll name though. :P
---
"for me"
---
If they were for elite specs, there probably would have been some icons missing, rather than them filling out all the remaining icons (including underwater weapons, which is far too problematic an area for them to go and add to elite specs).
---
If they were working on elite specs, they would have said something in the announcement.
---
Full version pls? &lt;3
---
How do you view teleport costs in these situations? Is it a non-issue? You just teleport whenever needed?
---
It's not gonna be like Silverwastes/Dry Top. Just compare the size of LWS3 maps and LWS4 maps. They're HUGE. And it would be really weird to downsize again. Maybe we will start with a map the size of Silverwastes, which is then going to increase in size to meet with the size of most recent maps.
---
And about the release cadence, at a different point in the interview it was asked what about the regularity of episodes being 2-3 months, and they responded they're gonna one-up and they are gonna happen more frequently. This is also supported by the fact, that they now have 4 Living World content teams instead of 3, as before.
---
Gorse is in all scenarios just Dpsing to 66% (while having a fast breakbar) -&gt; killing the adds -&gt; repeat. Qadim the Peerless has so much more movement, changing phases, it requires careful positioning, coordinated cc, many different roles.
---
I guess we'll see what happens. I'm just cautious about getting hyped I suppose.
---
Hot is seriously so pretty. I was so geeked about it when it first came out for quite awhile.
---
&gt; They will try to do releases faster rather than 3~4 months.
---
You will try...
---
"Good" for me just includes a functional preset, or just a short list of filters to mess with. The sheer number of shaders is a bit daunting for the novice.
---
DRAGONFALL Released with the 14th May, 2019 game update,next Map release in November....
---
[What is this?](https://imgur.com/kmx5l3y)
---
There is no 'should' in Guild Wars 2.  The best piece of general advice I can give you is to play the game however you wish.  If you take your time with it, you'll be able to savor and enjoy the parts of the game that are the most engaging.
---
I think you mean "best to take this at face value" which means no stupid leaps to conclusion about how many there are or when they might be complete
---
Okay, next interviewer should just straight up ask them about _elite specs_. We know the answer for expacs already.
---
Could you stop lying? Would be nice, thanks. ;)
---
You unlock the "quest" by finishing the last story instance. Talking to Gorrik is already part of it.
---
Same for completing the "quest". It ends with flying the Skyscale through different parcours all over Tyria, not with "talk to Gorrik".
---
Very bad try...
---
Whether or not it was for you is besides the point, the game only shifted during ls3 and even then they had path of fire after.
---
Here are the facts:
---
* Specilization weapon icons, are hexagonal black squares with a white weapon icon inside
---
* Those icons are used NOWHERE else in the game
---
* the game has icons for weapons (not the elite spec ones)
---
* There were icons missing (Focus, Spear, Mace, Scepter, Trident)
---
* Those missing icons were added
---
"If they were working on elite specs they would have said something"
---
No, literally not. Because Anet never talks about something until it is ready. And additionally, they said during the announcement, they have aces up their sleeves.
---
thx man sounds good to me with your explanation. i will stick with my DH since i used him at the beginning of it. my reaper i feel he runs too slow, but yeah i know that dude kills fast, but lol don't like running to slow. I have been thinking about power soulbeast w/ golemancer so 2 pets lol with longbow and gs. preferred some ranged coz i m just dead lazy. thx a lot bro
---
What do you mean it's besides the point? That was the entire point of this comment chain.
---
question is,how many minutes of quickness and ala you rly need :D  no1 saying that rene/fb is best,but that doesnt mean that you take wihout any issue:DRUID,healing ELE,healing RENE,healing NECRO and add CHRONO to any of them or even to FB. biggest issue in this game is,that ppl have no idea what other classes can do and simply go for SC site and playing only that. you can see that *cancer* fb/rene moving into normal T4 fractals which can be literaly done by anything.
---
I had been holding out hoping that the Astralaria cover would be unlocked, but dang it looks like it might not happen! Is there any way I can pledge for a standard book now so I don't miss my chance and then upgrade to the Astralaria cover if it unlocks within the next 20 hours? Should I just email you guys?
---
I miss being this hopeful ):
---
5 silver in disguise
---
6 months since last LS?
---
I am not being hopeful, I am merely pointing out facts. I know exactly what we're gonna get, and everything else is a pleasant surprise. That is all we know.
---
&gt; Too much glass, not enough cannon. 
---
This.  THIS.  100% **THIS.**  
---
Ele has been nerfed to utter SHIT.  For a class whose four elemental attunements have the potential to make them incredibly versatile, the little breadcrumbs of defense you have are nowhere near enough to justify playing seriously.
---
&gt; What about Dhuum (the original god of death)? I forgot if we killed him in GW1.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hall_of_Chains
---
Can we find it on YouTube or Spotify or Soundcloud or etc. ? :)
---
&gt; forsaken
---
Is this Warcraft? it's "Forgotten"
---
&gt; Shortly after the Gods came to Tyria, they realized that freelance use a all types a magic was dangerous and thus sealed magic into a colossal object known as the original bloodstone.
---
No, the original Bloodstone was created by the previous five races (Mursaat, Forgotten, Seers, Jotun and Dwarves - yes, Dwarves are ancient) to hold off Elder Dragons from consuming magic. Thousands years later after human gods arrived, Abaddon released that magic which: 1. sparked the first Guild War between human nations and 2. sparked the conflict between Abaddon and other gods. 1. led to 2. because King Doric asked the gods to seal the magic away again and Abaddon wasn't on board.
---
&gt; We know of the six Gods, but what of the others hinted at, such as Balthazar's bother in the Fissure of Woe.
---
Menzies is not a god. Dhuum WAS a god and has been stripped of his powers and defeated several times and finally sealed away, Arachnia was only mentioned in GW.dat file and since is not canon. It is unclear how "mantles of power" work (is Desmina a goddess of death bc she's ruling the Underworld now?) but aside from the current Five, there are no other gods "hinted at".
---
&gt; Are the dragons inherently evil?
---
All dragons? No. Elder Dragons? Also no - Aurene. Kralkatorrik's arc and recent reveals about Jormag might suggest the original Elder Dragons were something else.
---
&gt; What's going on in Cantha nowadays?
---
We'll most probably never know.
---
Open World means Power. Anything else is a headache, be it condi, support, tank, etc. That narrows the list of accepted "meta" raid builds that work in open world almost completely. Strip out the ones without inherent survivability, because you're not going to kill Champions or even some high-level veterans with the meta Power Holo build that revolves around you overheating and getting healed by allies, and it's basically none of them.
---
Oh cool, thanks!  I used to play GW1 and played the original beta for GW2, but haven't had a chance to start playing until recently.
---
Triple Trouble should be compared to  map-wide metas, not world bosses...
---
should've been a picture of turai ossa and a label saying "this meme was brought to you by the mordant crescent"
---
That's true of the quest log in a lot of games. Most quests in most games are Just filler.  But yeah, I agree there needs to be more instruction and ways for new people to find content.
---
These are pretty amazing. What app are you using to draw?
---
Honestly, as someone who doesn't even like this game's PvP at all, I really do feel for you.  I feel bad that Arenanet seems to treat y'all as if you're not an important part of the playerbase lmao
---
Suggestions/ideas for dyes to use on primeval armor to match tormented shield?
---
So Tangled Depths is actually one of the most profitable maps in the game?
---
Do you mind elaborating? It's always been one of my favorite games, and I would LOVE to command there again. It honestly makes me nostalgic for the HoT heydays.
---
Can you also elaborate on the farm you do for Kourna? I would love to command there again too.
---
Lastly, Sandswept Isles is just harvesting coral orbs?
---
So many of the asura boots just clip instead of having extra toes added. Its beyond frustrating.
---
I haven't tried that and I just went on the game to check the price on the TP..and it must be a Glyph I can only buy with the gathering tool. Maybe I'll try it one day because that is interesting. Though, I'm sure volatile magic tools will still beat anything because you actually get extra volatile magic when gathering nodes such as Sandswept's Diflorite Crystal (that's why that one is so high). It is an interesting thought to do the Glyph on a mining tool if I did an Orr gathering run.
---
As long as the cadence improves... But the elephant in the room is that they spend a lot of resources on story instances, so why not cut there instead?
---
No it's not. They spend far more resources in the story instances than in the new maps. Please quit with this bullshit.
---
Damn u right
---
Every day. I used to be in a guild that's soul purpose was to run TT every night.
---
I am still in denial about that. It's too logical
---
NA does suck. Have you seen how barren the Raid LFG is?
---
Then I tuned into Mightyteapot's streams, and can you believe it: EU Raid LFG has a SCROLL BAR!!!
---
If the rewards suck, no one will play it, and then they'll throw their hands into the air and say no one wants this type of content, and let it rot again.
---
So they better give it decent rewards.
---
Idk what you mean, I kill TT everyday on NA, its organized at least 3 times
---
The Silverwastes is relevant because it has good rewards. Map size is not the problem, but map content and rewards.
---
"The layoffs are likely to end up beneficial to the game, as there will be a renewed focus on their only revenue generator"
---
I heard that, but I can't think this as anything not PR. Sometimes we hear that the layoffs only affected people working on other proyects (not GW2 related). Sometimes we hear that the layoffs were hard for the team and that they are doing their best.
---
What bothers me of this is that anet employees seem to take one or the other when they need it and switch just as easily.
---
"But at this point in time, it would be very unwise for the developers to abandon any game mode whatsoever"
---
They are not abandoing raids, we heard it at the announcement. They are doing 10 man content in the giant frozen boss they showed. Idk how they named it but it was easy mode raids. We don't know the details. Will it have CM? Will it be like normal raids? Will there be another fractal CM sometime?
---
Don't get me wrong, I liked what they showed, I'll play Icebrood saga. I'll even try to show the game to a friend because I think that HoT+PoF (and core) is so fun. The thing is that I've played for 3,5k hours (and I know that it's a low number for other people) and I don't know what to expect from the devs. I want to keep playing new and exciting stuff, I love the game, but I feel like I'm walking on quicksand and I don't like it.
---
You activate Skyscale Scales and Skyscale Medicine by talking to Gorrik and to get A Hopeful Cure you have to return to Gorrik after finishing those in order to activate Skyscale Fever. You complete Fever, go to Gorrik, complete Eggs and return to Gorrik. Dragonfall part completed.

"where are the rest of the Bloodstones?"
---
There were only five. Maguuma (Bloodstone Fen), Ring of Fire (Abaddon's Mouth), Shiverpeaks (Bloodstone caves). The other two are location unknown, but I could have sworn that Divinty's Reach was built on one. I think they haven't been revealed because they were planned as mcguffin for expansions to introduce new areas.
---
"Do they still serve the function of separating the various kinds of magic? Why do the dragons not seek them out?"
---
The Bloodstone was made to seal and hide magic to protect it from the Dragons. You could surmise it retained those properties after it was split and spread out. I guess "warded" from Dragons would be a way to consider them. That opens up other lore questions as to why the races couldn't use that warding to protect themselves also, but we could assume that because it was Seer magic that predated the human gods that no one in modern age could figure it out.
---
"Since the stone in Abaddon's Mouth seals the door of Kamalie, what happens if it is destroyed now?"
---
Probably the same thing that is happening the the Mouth of Torment in the Desolation. Localized corruption of the area. The Door of Komalie specifically led to the Foundy of Failed Creations. It was a staging ground for Abaddon's army to come through, led by the Fury. We banished Abaddon and killed the Fury and Malyx in GW1, so for all we know the Forgotten have re-established the foundry as a prison and the Door of Komalie would be just another portal into Realm of Torment (GW2 already has two).
---
"We know of the six Gods, but what of the others hinted at, such as Balthazar's bother in the Fissure of Woe."
---
Weren't enough types of magic to go around.
---
"Are the dragons inherently evil?"
---
They are supposed to be part of the life-cycle of Tyria. Primordial forces of nature. A hurricane, or virus, aren't inherently evil but we characterize them as such. The races of Tyria see the Dragons as evil because the Dragons place in nature is to consume everything and then sleep to let the world refresh for a few centuries. Similar to the plot of Reign of Fire.
---
"What's going on in Cantha nowadays?"
---
They are xenophobic isolationists. There are no non-human races or outsiders allowed and trade/travel are heavily restricted.  After Factions, Cantha pretty much decided they don't want to deal with the rest of the world's BS.  If there is ever a Deep Sea Dragon then maybe, MAYBE, we could see Cantha. But given the Canthan district was removed from LA and Anet hastily backstepped on all of the water related content and gameplay, I doubt we will ever see it.
---
Wouldn't it make more sense to make new content that would be new for 100% of the player base?
---
Shady Consortium is shady.
---
They're not "too flashy", they're exactly par for the course in terms of what ANet's GFX team is capable of pumping out.
---
Best just to browse all the shoes in the wardrobe in your personal bank wile on your asuran.
---
Arenanet: "Sorry but we absolutely cannot afford to create a new mount skin because we are stretched too thin. And the layoffs hit us hard and we need to focus on living world and yaddayaddayadda"
---
Also Arenanet: *proceeds to release 30 new mount skins in gemstore*
---
I was under the impression he found the mirror of Lyss, rather than it being gifted to him.  I'll have to reread this whole thing.  
---
However, Lyssa wasn't neutral.  I believe Kormir said "even Lyssa" helped seal Balthazaar.  I find it odd she said "even Lyssa" as well.
---
The 6th line of Leadership runes is the biggest deal for me. I use them all the time on Herald and it's just a guess as to when the 45 seconds are back up.
---
Anet will love this guide lol .
---
Use your characters efficiently. I have 3 mains that I play around with a lot, so those keep my quest items, random stuff, keys and shits. 
---
Then I have my bag opener, my crafting guy (that holds all legendary or expensive crafting materials), my KP guy (holds all my raids kps and such) and lastly I have other characters mostly to fill roles in raids that I don't really use in open world that keep my ascended gear, one keeps armor the other keeps trinkets. 
---
My bank is then only used to keep all my convenience items, some hot-swapable gear for my mains, and over excess of materials like Tomes Ectos Obsidian Shards etc ..
---
Not from me, I'm afraid. Was too focused on trying to help the person to take screenshots.
---
Let me ask you? What are the going to show for Alliances, before its actually completed. It's not like they can put them half in the game while finishing the other half. Yes, changing the back end of any 7 year old program takes a lot more time than making a new map.  It is a long time to wait for that sort of thing, but I suspect it's a lot more complicated than people seem to think it is.

I've already chatted with you on the Discord, thanks for sharing and for your work, I love it!

Could you share some rich node routes (specifically iron)? Do you use tekkit for everything listed?

Also, why don't you use gw2efficiency.com to calculate g/h? What's your reasoning behind that?

Thanks in advance!

Why are you down voting him hes right.

We won’t ever get these types of rewards consistently as the game only survives because of micro transactions.

Super interested in this series just to compare the builds I came up with to the ones WP worked out.

I do that because I am too poor, RIP.

Hopefully the release difficulty, not post-expansion

---
Hurry! Swallow it!
---
Yeah, it makes outfit design difficult
---
Fuck Heart of Thorns was good. I loved that gameplay experience, of slowly gaining the masteries.
---
Ohhh yess I love to answer these questions. 
---
Tangled Depths: For this benchmark, I got really luck and most of the pre-events for each camp was already finished. When those pre-events finish, then the map goes from being linear to dynamic in terms of events. Each camp spawns random events of their own and it goes on forever. I've attempted this map many times and I always begin at least 30 minutes after the meta would have started (so 7:00 PM EDT as an example). The map has a horrible habit of closing out or Nuhoch lane gets bugged. If I entered a map without all the pre-events done, I made sure to do them so I can get these dynamic events going. I've figured out what spawns where and how they function so I kinda knew where to move around after I finished an event. I just go bam bam bam with events and it nets me all those Shiny Baubles. I also gathered almost all the caches throughout the lanes before the meta/after killing Garent. A lot of people AFK until the final reward but if you have extra time, get those caches! 
---
Kourna: This is a very chill one. I literally run around and do almost all the events. There are very specific events I never ever do because they either 1) don't drop loot or 2) Takes too long. I've figured out which events do give loot and which upscales and continuously do them. The meta has a 10 minute cooldown AFTER the timer on the right orange text disappears. From there, while I do other events, I time myself and do the pre-events immediately to start the meta right away. The best events there the cannons defenses, any escort that has a "Researcher \[insert asuran nane\]" (especially Emm), Champ Shark, Veteran Choya. These bounties are fantastic and quick if you have a great group: Asphodel and Troopmarshal. 
---
Sandswept: I did not discriminate for the nodes. I literally gathered EVERYTHING. Even the lentils! I cleaned that whole map
---
Crystal Oasis: This is a VERY fun one with a large group! It is the most active POF map out of all of them. The only downside is waiting for the Choya for the meta...but afterward, it's an event fest. With my guild, I do this very (broad) route: I started the Pinata, Leggy Choya, 2 bounties: Tazula &amp; Maverick, events that deal with Forged (farm defense, save the caravan, raiding party). Then I move towards the middle waypoint with the escort that starts at \[&amp;BJQKAAA=\], defense event that happens afterward. Then the leggy Wurm. The cycle continues from here because there's a Forged escort that also begins at the mid waypoint that goes towards the first waypoint. When that finishes, there's usually another long Forged escort and the whole thing repeats. THOUGH, because it's Crystal Oasis, a lot of people need bounties from the 3rd waypoint (the east one). If someone requests the leggy Facet, I will eventually get to that side of the map and do these bounties: Facet, Shardcrest, Uussh Visshta. There are also funny events such as the Champ Hydra/Champ Wurm/escort with a lost child. At the 3rd waypoint, there are also two Forged events that's a defense, and another at  \[&amp;BGAKAAA=\] . 
---
Sorry I kinda rambled..it's kind of hard to explain what goes through my mind when I command these maps LOL. It's all very impromtu and on the spot.
---
2 to 3 month cycle? We got used to delays and 4 month releases. Lmao
---
gold per hour really depends on your route and efficiency .
---
for example last night i made 48 gold in one hour gathering varietal peppercorn seeds with my 20 characters(tho i play on China server). and before that i was making 20ish gold per hour by gathering varietal clove seeds .
---
so farming really depends on your efficiency and route planning.
---
I agree. I also did not play HoT at launch, so it wasn't just the nostalgia that influenced my perception. Played the core game at launch, came back a little while before PoF and played all the HoT content.
---
I still think HoT was just leagues ahead of anything else in the game at that point and today. I thought the zone design was incredible, I loved the replayability offered through the complex vertical design. Even tangled depths, which I initially hated like everyone else, I grew to love.
---
There's so many hidden elements on that map and surprisingly shortcuts that most people aren't aware of. Showing someone around makes you fear like Bear Grylls. Reminded me a lot of the interconnectivity of the world in the first Dark Souls.
---
The map design also plays into this underlying sense of being deep in a hostile jungle, behind enemy lines. It's a feeling I really enjoyed, and I thought overall the atmosphere of the levels matched in really well with both gameplay and story elements. 
---
I felt the difficulty was right in point. I enjoyed the extra challenge in the hero points and how every hero point felt like an accomplishment, either pulling it off solo or coordinating with some people in map chat to take it down. Needing to communicate and find people to do a hero point with felt much more engaging than any meta or heart events in the game. Much of GW2 suffers from actually just being too streamlined - it's too easy to jump seamlessly from event to event. It works great at first, but eventually I think the way GW2 is designed tends to just push you towards playing the game on autopilot. HoT really changed that formula for the better and made you think about how you moved through the world a lot more.
---
And then as far as Metas go, Verdant Brink is hands down my favorite in all of GW2. It's the only one I will go back and play just because I think it's fun without caring what the rewards will be.
---
Was saddened when I saw so much negative feedback from the community about the maps and then how different PoF was by comparison. HoT will likely be the only content I consider going back to replay in the future.
---
I'm guessing Dragonfall, is just doing the meta events all the way through on repeat?
---
Sounds like the job market.
---
Still say that first time in heart of the north was my best guild wars experience, I miss classic guildwars :(
---
yeah nice work.
---
tho farming is pretty dead in China server. nobody's doing farming  when you can just buy 500 gold for 34 yuan(4.7 US dollars). LOL
---
&gt;Pug groups will always run with a healer (in over 250ess i havent found a single group wanting no heals).  
---
&gt;They always want healbrand and say heal ren is trash.  
---
&gt;At least this was my experience.
---
What is heal? I can't hear you over the sound of my DPS
---
It's not even a "show off."
---
It's just pure annoyance, and these people 'love' how annoying they are. The secret is that they don't, but they change the narrative to justify the purchase they did.
---
Ok. You have no confidenve to run it nor wish to "bother" to learn any of it...
---
Why are you complaining about something you don't want to do? Sorry English is not my 1st language please eli5 to me
---
Well there's a huge difference between announcing it in a public map chat and telling your friends or family about it. Fact of the matter is that most of the time if someone is genuinely feeling at their lowest points the last thing they will be doing is going out in the open talking to completely random people in a public venue. The first place someone in a very dark state of mind seeks comfort from is from the people that they care about the most, or the people they have formed actual bonds with.
---
Idk as someone who has undergone this sort of stuff personally, to me it sounds like the person described about in the OP was just feeling genuinely miserable and wanted attention. That said I don't think it's a bad thing at all for people to drop what they're doing and try to comfort them, but I think you should know that there *are* a lot of people who do genuinely just want some positive attention and a helping hand to feel better about their lives and themselves. It is dangerous to assume that everyone who says they're going to do it is just an attention seeker, of course, but we shouldn't immediately assume everyone who says they will is being genuine about it either. Talk to them, find out what's going on in their life, and see how serious it is. Direct them to help if needed be.
---
Gonna kill someone if ele gets shortbow, I hate shortbow. I wouldn't mind anything else.
---
I agree completely. And having at least some cool mount skins and armor/weapon skins in game would keep people playing, which ultimately means a healthier game and more people who are likely to buy gems for other things. Right now so many stop playing regularly because there’s not many cool rewards to earn in game itself after you reach a certain point. Losing active players means less people to buy gems. If anet would invest in the health of their game they would see more profits in the long term.
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
I don't use tekkit or any other guides. I can't find any guides of how I do it..but I'm sure many people do this similar route. So I figured out where all the rich iron and platinum are and I go from left to right then to the middle in terms of the world map. So Brisband (&amp; spinach), Kessex, Gendarran (&amp; spinach), Harathi, Lonar, Snowden, Frostgorge (butternut squash), Diessa, Fireheart (&amp;butternut squash), Iron Marches, Blazeridge, Fields of Ruin, Dredgehaunt, Timberline, Bloodtide, Sparkfly. If I wanted extra nodes, Dredgehaunt and Timberline were great to run around in. I know that's not really a guide..but I hope that gives ya a good idea of where I go. 
---
I didn't use gw2efficiency because the other one was more pretty LOL. I felt like the UI was better. Though, both can get wonky if you've sold or bought stuff from the TP so I only use them to as a secondary source to keep track of my materials.
---
simple, it means "interns at work"
---
I want it to be better than that, allowing us to pan, zoom and turn in all 3 axis like in GW1's dye preview.

I'd be even better if they merged all 3 separate previews into one: The one in the hero panel, the one in makeover kits, and the one from right clicking gear.  
---
That way we'd be able to preview any appearance with any gear and any dye.

Davie!

If you can smell something then you probably have a pretty good idea of what it tastes like. You don't need to actually eat shit to imagine what shit tastes like, you smell it every day so you can probably guess.
---
I can properly taste cilantro so I wouldn't know the soap taste people talk about but I imagine when they taste cilantro their brain makes a connection to the smell of generic soap and then they think "this tastes like soap."
---
Updating every minute is nice and all, but that means that you can be 59s later than the bot.
---
Also the api itself updates every 3 min
---
Yes. The escorts from a fresh map, to doing all those mini events, to the pre-meta events, to the meta, and ending it with the champ train.

**1) On the bloodstones and Balthazar's taken divinity**
---
The third Bloodstone, which Linsey Murdock called the Shiverpeaks Bloodstone back in the day, was located in the [Bloodstone Caves](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Bloodstone_Caves) in GW1 that would be in the cave in northeastern Straits of Devastation in GW2 times if we look at that_shaman's [historical guide to Tyria](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-840&amp;y=670.875&amp;z=3) map. :)
---
If we visit that cave area in GW2, though, we simply find an empty vault with no means of going deeper into that former dungeon area. It's unclear if lorewise the stone is presently supposed to be farther inside the caves, or if someone has removed the bloodstone from the cave and transferred it somewhere else, possibly to that so far unexplorable patch of land, once called Snake Dance, between present-day Sparkfly Fen and Timberline Falls maps.
---
The locations of the fourth bloodstone as well as the fifth bloodstone (which also doubles as the Keystone that can be used to unite the bloodstones into one whole again) currently remain unknown. I wouldn't be surprised if we found one of these two bloodstones either somewhere in the charr lands or in the Far Shiverpeaks at this point if the story ever decides to return to the subject of the bloodstones as theoretically all the four bloodstones should've charged up from the demises of the Elder Dragons, particularly after Kralkatorrik's death as Tom Abernathy suggested on the [Lore Q&amp;A thread](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1007220/#Comment_1007220) that Aurene may not have absorbed all of Kralk's magic upon her ascension.
---
&gt; **Q:** Aurene absorbed the power of Kralkatorrik, did some of his magic escape and reached other remaining dragons too or it's solely hers now? (we know that when a dragon dies, his magic gets absorbed by other dragons in a distance)  
---
&gt; **Tom Abernathy:** Good question. Highly relevant. Strong chance it will get addressed.  
---
&gt; **Tom Abernathy:** (answering a question about what happened with Balthazar's magic) Balthazar's divine energy—assuming you mean his magic—went into Aurene, Kralkatorrik, and, presumably, every other Elder Dragon on Tyria. And yeah, that probably matters enough that it will come up again at some point.  
---
As we learned in the Season 3 plot, the Maguuma Bloodstone was supercharged by the magics of Zhaitan and especially Mordremoth, not helped by White Mantle tinkering with the bloodstone and turning it unstable as it began rapidly expanding its mass. The same would have thus happened to the other bloodstones (Ring of Fire, Shiverpeaks, and the two unknown ones) on some level as even dragons quite a distance away from Mordremoth and Zhaitan such as Jormag and Kralkatorrik received the slain dragons' magic to some extent.
---
The curious thing in these answers is that Tom seems to have misunderstood the second question about Balthazar's divinity as he thought the person asking it meant Balthazar's energy as it was released at the end of PoF when the asker meant where the gods stored Balthazar's taken divinity since Balthy's failed insurrection (as the Balthazar we met in Season 3 and PoF was no longer a god as confirmed by Kormir herself; at most he would be at demigod level after absorbing the magic of the Maguuma Bloodstone and some of the magic from Jormag and Primordus).
---
We've yet to learn who if any replaced Balthazar as the new deity of conflict in the pantheon of the Six as his divinity had been taken long before Aurene hatched, and Nightfall lore with Abaddon and Kormir revealed that a god's divinity can't just be taken without giving it a vessel (like Kormir took in Abaddon's power) or else the magic will run rampant and destroy everything in its path.
---
The bloodstones haven't been perfect containers for magic as they've been slowly leaking out magic over the centuries until the deaths of the Elder Dragons have released more ambient magic into the environment.
---
If any of the four bloodstones was destroyed or drilled through like we saw with Maguuma Bloodstone, the fallout from the explosion would be massive as the Maguuma Bloodstone's explosion radius would've easily wiped out as distant locations as Lion's Arch if Balthazar hadn't absorbed the blast. It's possible that if such a catastrophe were to occur with any of the four bloodstones, Aurene or another Elder Dragon might swoop in to absorb that blast. Primordus, being the closest to the Ring of Fire Bloodstone at the moment, would no doubt take the lion's share of that bloodstone's magic, but it's less clear cut who'd get the biggest slice of the explosion of any other bloodstone at this moment and if they'd be fast enough to prevent that rapidly expanding magic explosion from destroying a large region of Tyria (given how fast the Maguuma Bloodstone's explosion spread in the cinematic).
---
**2) On Menzies**
---
Menzies is an unknown entity as we don't know if he's just a mortal with unnatural powers or a demigod; all we know is that he and Balthazar are half-brothers but we don't know if that shared parent is mortal or divine. My bet would be on Menzies being like pre-ascension Grenth: a demigod except far more sinister than Grenth was. We did see members of Menzies's Shadow Army fighting both the Pact and the Branded due to sensing Balthazar's magic in Kralk and Aurene (and thus innately hating each dragon due to their curse to fight anything Balthazar represents), but we sadly don't know Menzies's fate.
---
The [Strange Burning Scrolls](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Strange_Burning_Scroll) written by the Herald/Devona suggest that something happened in the Eternal Battle to shift Balthazar's focus from the Shadow Army to the Elder Dragons, and we also got a statement from Scott McGough in which he explained that part of Balthazar's reason for wanting to take on the Elder Dragons was boredom. These clues would suggest that Balthazar and the Eternals defeated Menzies's Shadow Army between GW1 and GW2, but there was also a statement from Peter Fries during one of the guild chats that they had originally planned for more Menzies references in PoF until such references were mostly cut out for unstated reasons (likely during PoF's late rewrites that altered the narrative somewhat).
---
&gt; Captain, Balthazar pursues the whelp of Kralkatorrik, Vlast. All is as it should be, even if we do not comprehend his grand strategy. He is the lord of war, and he will not be questioned. The Elder Dragons will fall to our might, and Vlast is the key. Your faith will be rewarded. Your hesitation will be punished. **Things have changed since the Eternal Battle.** We must adapt or be swept away in his burning rage. Do not speak of this again.  
---
Personally I'd love to find out that Menzies survived via some trickery and made Balthazar believe he was dead, thus turning Balthazar's attention from the Shadow Army to the Elder Dragons. If written well, Menzies could become a great antagonist either in a raid or even in a living world episode if he acted like Abaddon's demonic servants (the Fortune Teller and Terick/Razakel who manipulated Shiro and Khilbron) did and appeared in a disguise to goad a "front villain" to wage war in Tyria which Menzies would ultimately benefit from as the Lord of Destruction. Even with Balthazar gone, Menzies could view the Commander and Aurene as his primary enemies not only for killing his half-brother before he had the chance to, but also because Aurene seems to have consumed Balthazar's soul (thus the greatsword reacting positively to Aurene as opposed to Kralkatorrik) and could become the object of his wrath. And if Balthazar has been replaced in the pantheon by a new war deity (possibly the GW1 hero to explain his/her odd absence from world affairs and why he/she neglected to help Vlast, Elona, Cantha and Kryta in their time of need), consuming Aurene's power and crushing the Commander would be Menzies's first step at getting his revenge on the neo-Balthazar so he can finally become the god of war himself.

**3) On the dragons**
---
Tom Abernathy confirmed in War Eternal guild chat that Kralkatorrik's torment predates his consumption of Zhaitan, Mordy and Balthy magic, and that Kralk was never a "good guy" in the past; his sole redeeming trait was his genuine love for his family, but he seemed to have despised mortals and didn't want peace with them in the past for unknown reasons and thus worked to prevent the prophecy from coming to pass. It would be interesting if this hatred was somehow tied to his "mother"; if in the past mortals killed his mother, and he held a grudge against all mortals since.
---
As such, we don't know if all the Elder Dragons started out as neutral beings until they became greedy junkies for that delicious magic. It's also possible that some if not most of them were jerks even before they became "corrupted" by magic because, as Glint explained, Elder Dragons never had the same kind of intimate, understanding relationship with mortals as Aurene had, and thus they could not empathize with the races. Even Glint struggled with mortal races until her telepathic abilities allowed her to read her victims' minds and made her realize the importance of the "lesser" races.
---
**4) On Cantha**
---
Aside from what little we've been told in the Movement of the World article about Cantha becoming isolationist partly due to the Emperor's policy and partly due to Zhaitan's rising of Orr which blocked contact with the outside world, we did get hints in Season 2 prologue that the Zephyrites may have visited Cantha before taking a "detour" to the Crystal Desert to grab the egg that contained Aurene. Marjory pointed out how the decorations the Zephyrites had brought with them reminded her of the stuff her parents had inherited from her grandparents, and we know Marjory has Canthan ancestry from Season 1 dialogue.
---
So, as recently as 1327 AE, the Zephyrites have visited either Cantha or one of its outposts, and apparently Canthans were willing to trade with the Zephyrites despite some Zephyrites not only being non-Canthan but also non-human at this point in time. Whether this means the current regime's policy has become more lenient after that trade blockade from Zhaitan, or if Zephyrites were simply more diplomatic and only took their Canthan members to trade with the locals, is unknown. But theoretically aerial access to Cantha is now possible as Zhaitan is no longer blocking any route through Orr aerial space. :)
---
&gt; We need unique reward for each map and type of gameplay
---
What kind of unique reward you mean?
---
Good catch but I think they also made Abaddon one of the original group that arrived in Tyria? If so, then it's an inconsistency at worst and a retcon at best.
---
The only other thing I can think of right now is a new god of war. We never learned what happened with Balthazar's original "godhood", they never really talked about this or hinted anything. (I remember someone saying they wanted Aurene to say "I am a new god of war" after she ascendes. It might be just my wild imagination but if not, it would make no sense since Balthazar's powers came from the Maguuma Bloodstone and I'm glad they didn't go with it.)
---
Interesting, I was really curious, thanks for the quick response :)
---
I like gathering because it requires literally no setup and there's close to no variance in the results.
