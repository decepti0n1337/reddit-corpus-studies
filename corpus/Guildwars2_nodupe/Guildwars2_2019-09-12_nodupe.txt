What kind of monster are you?

You committed to that. You went out of your way to achieve that. You sacrificed in order to give yourself a steeper hill to climb.

Get mounts and fly through all the maps now.

It would be way too strong. Imagine a second: you would be able to stop someone with Muddy Terrain, have some nice hammer time on them, then use Lightning Reflexes so they can't touch ~~this~~ you.

Anet is a company consiting of many peoples. Only a certain few will make the rules.
---
The people who enforce the rules are likely not the ones who make them and it seems, they are unsure on what they even are.

Is Anet trying to become a meme? Because between how they "handled" the criticism after the last announcement and things like this...that's how you become a meme. And I'm not even talking about the mods of the official forums.

Gw2 would come smashing into azeroth and solve its problems in a year.

Thank you, I usually don't have much trouble with remembering them which made me think that the requirements for a password must be different than at other sites, but I'm not very sure.
---
Now that you mention it, I would like some armor masks from the Iceborne expansion. Since it's snowy
---
If you value charged quartz at buy/sell price then provisioner token are not that expensive, but you're missing the opportunity cost of crafting and selling stuff that sells for a buttload of gold on the tp.

Did ANET promote their forum mods into GMs? Oh dear...

The Witcher!

Sounds more like a condition to me. A buff would have had someone give actual help

WoW, mostly for its story / lore.

100% the first thing that came to mind.  I'm glad I am not the only one bahaha

Even then "launch" trailers usually come out a day or even a few days before the game actually launches

If you get a t4 DryTop, you can get 19 quartz on the map - two near Crash Site 1  \[&amp;BHUHAAA=\]  (going up the mountain to the vista), one either by Crash Site 3 \[&amp;BJYHAAA=\] OR underneath at the Inquest Base  \[&amp;BJMHAAA=\] .  The rich node is at Cragrock Palace  \[&amp;BIoHAAA=\] You can't get in until xx:50 (during the sandstorm), and you have to beat the Skritt Queen and a bunch of name skritt.

Guild Wars 1. I'd love to be able to go back in time on my current character and just play that content differently. You know, jumping over logs that used to block my way for no real reason. lol
---
While we’re at it, let’s make all the gen one legendaries have the same one-second-trails that most of not all of the gen two legendaries have.
---
Thanks :)
---
&gt; You're just acting toxic and entitled.
---
Now that's what I call projection. I don't act anything since I do not play that kind of content anymore (the MMO part). You can ask yourself why that gamemode is unfun and Anet is going to basically abandon it. It's only my fault if you blame me for not wanting to play it.
---
Darkest timeline.
---
you got this backwards
---
Great job I have been 3/4 of the way with this one for a bout a year lol. Impressive!
---
Your footsteps change too! Daytime they glow, and nighttime they sprout coral
---
I bought both gw2 expansions a few years back but eventually stopped playing thinking of coming back for a bit
---
I'm mostly interested in PvE content. What content is active? I remember dungeons not having that many players but the other PvE being unkind to newbies and undergeared players like I was at the time.
---
Is chronomancer gear still a pain to get? I forget which gear it was, whatever made buffs last longer.
---
The full thief with double quip raid when unload got buffed was a wonderful thing
---
I recently made Rogort because it was less flashy. I prefer being able to actually see my character.  Personally I think some legendaries are ridiculously glowy and believe having an alternative is good for people that aren't into that sort of thing.  That way both types of people have options.
---
Aha. And now?
---
Jumping puzzles aren't group content.  If you're using a mesmer to port to the end, you're by definition, not doing the jumping puzzle.
---
Literally first result of searching trophy, you bad at reddit and bad at life
---
Lol, bringing back the bunny thumper from GW1? Yes please.
---
It is not supposed to look modern, it is supposed to feel like diablo 2 and it does a pretty good job at that...if you disclude the MTXs :D
---
I wish they'd redo the armor system to have revealing AND tactical armor sets for all characters regardless of gender. Pretty sure m/f charr and asura have the same body model regardless of character gender so they'd really only need to revamp 3 races. We'll never actually get to see it happen but I can dream.
---
I dont think I've seen this post so far.
---
&gt;Now that's what I call projection.
---
No it's not, you said, and I quote, 
---
&gt;Nah if I did raids, I would just fake KP and ruin a few runs until I learned the mechanics.
---
That's toxic and entitled.
---
There's a control option to select an ally which targets basically any non-player allied unit.
---
Hahahaha did you see that thread about Ronald McDonald ingame cosplay? At least a dozen comments about how cancerous the guy with the faint pink glow next to him looked. This meme is completely backwards.
---
and made the game unplayable every 3 months

what the fucking shit

Housing system was AMAZING

You didn't go zone at a time?  You have fucked up now.

I'm pretty sure Gpose lets you modify stuff like pose, lighting, etc.

At least that's what it looks like from doing a quick google search.

You mean enameled emblaze is best dye

Sorry, maybe you misunderstood my comment. I do believe you!  I was commenting that other people downvoted you, not me :)  I get very good performance with a similar setup, that's all I was saying. Probably you get a lot out of overclocking, which makes up the difference.
---
Question: Is world completion necessary for alts which I will actually play instead of being used for things like only doing dailies? If so, why? (new player btw)
---
Oh I know I just didn't know a better comment to reply too to post that
---
Add it to the list...
---
I know we can take screenshots with *Print Screen*, but it's a shame they haven't added filters and all that sort of things. Like Horizon Zero Down or Shadows of Mordor. Both games have photo mode.
---
It is a pity that we have to open the folder, find the screenshot and edit it ourselves instead of doing it in the game.
---
My Charr is an engineer and I like carrying my flame thrower with me all the time so I run upright.
---
What is the wrong if ipay some mesmer to jump jps for me? This is mmo right? Players help each others
---
Yeah I keep an alt parked at Issormir's Body with a couple of stacks of quartz. Log in, charge, log out. Part of my stripped-down daily routine.
---
Boon chrono is still take in basically all raids to cover quickness and alacrity. You'll still see it in other content especially pug fractals but higher tier fractal groups and more meta raid groups are running a firebrand (power/condi/heal) and a renegade (power boon/heal) to cover quickness and alacrity respectively since they provide more DPS and utility than chronomancer alone. Heal firebrand can carry groups in fractals really well and the DPS version provides perm quickness while still having high DPS. Renegade provides perm alacrity and a lot of utility, lower DPS than Firebrand but still decent.
---
Sharur was my 3rd legendary when it was released, but i think that need a visual upgrade
---
The only thing stopping me is hammer builds.. hammers in this game is weak and has no love
---
So, actually.......yes, there are cases of this. She'd potentially get flagged as buying gold.
---
Dungeons and Dragons Online
---
DDO now has travel between the different realms of Eberron, The Forgotten Realms, Ravenloft, and Greyhawk. They also made a lot of classic rpg Modules like Halls of Eveningstar, Temple of Elemental Evil, White Plume Mountain and others playable in the game.
---
The game was quest based instances up to 6 people at a time (12 in a Raid) with some explorable wildernesses thrown in. Its kind of the anti Guild Wars 2 where Dungeons were the focus with open world zones being secondary. Every quest was like a Guild Wars 2 Dungeons but a million times better. Every dungeon had its own story, unique setting, monsters, and storylines that spanned multiple quests and even raids. 
---
Also DDO had some of the best raids back in the day. Classic chromatic Dragons, Giants, giant Warforged Titans, and even raids against the Devils of Hell. Game was amazing back in the early 2010s.
---
I would love to take some Tyrian characters for a run through that world.
---
This is actually kind of funny.. more sad but funny.. I’m sorry OP lol.
---
The WvW community “communicate with us about the the road map for the game.  Fix the lag, fix the balance issues, ban the botters/hackers!”
---
Anet response “OMG  go get that guy in the LFG offering 1g per jumping puzzle, but just remember selling raid spots in LFG is ok”
---
Thank you Anet.. my game just got so much better because you got rid of that player offering 1g for jumping puzzle help in an mmo game....
---
Lol................
---
Cause it's dumb and unecesary and hurts the eye.
---
:(
---
:eyes: With enough characters, you could go around Mount Maelstrom, Kourna, and Sandswept. I believe there's more herb farms but those are the ones I can think of on the top of my head right now.
---
Well it’s doing the total opposite for me. The more they show the more clear it seems to be that there’s nothing significant.
---
They will be scales for 10 open world players in random gear and builds this means that any half competent 5man group will still faceroll them but maybe see a mechanic instead of bursting it in 5sec.
---
I hope they don't scale with player count so I can still try to lowman to increase the difficulty. They will be balanced to be completable with a random matchmaked squad that doesn't even cover boons or has players on raid builds. Any decent 5er group will still be able to have double to triple the group dps of a 10 player squad if there are no raid or fractal players in it.
---
Looking forward to complete them with 5players aswell but having no scaling is  the only way to not instakill it in seconds because i'm pretty sure that it wont be balanced for raid builds.
---
Whack-a-mole
---
It's more common in S2 because the Commander didn't get voice lines.
---
Another funny occurrence is when you have a transformation during Omadd's machine. I try to remember to use one every time I do it. Some get rather weird results.

I was literally gonna say Dark Souls BECAUSE of the content.
---
Introduce world pvp in gw2 and make it real! I like killing players,  but doing it with style on pink asura with pink shiny outfit 🤣
---
or at least learn to hold your phone
---
My asura agrees,  got outfit and highlights in hair 😎
---
Or they could spend dev time on actually delivering the things they said they would deliver and have been "working on" for the past year+.
---
Your armour needs to be repaired.
---
Anyway, how much Volatile Magic do you have?  Go buy Trophy Shipments.  If you're really cash-dry and can't afford to do that, you can convert Laurels into Heavy Crafting Bags, but the better option would likely be to clear out some of your bank/materials for gold and then get Trophy Shipments.
---
Point is you don't have to focus in farming something specific, like T6 in your case.
---
Just farm meta events, fractal dailies, do gathering and anything else that is profitable in the game, then sell EVERYTHING that you don't need for this legendary armor --&gt; make golds --&gt; buy what you need.
---
Also mystic curios at crafting 450-500. Easy, quick and cheap. (For Weaponsmith,Artificer and Huntsman).
---
Gw1 for the gvg+HA
---
&gt;hurts the eye
---
Yeah let's not exaggerate things. I'm sure there are people whose eyes are perfectly mine.
---
ArenaNet once took over publishing from NCSoft. Did NCSoft take it back with the lay-offs?
---
I guess in my mind if I was that into the whole fashion thing and I wanted pics of my character or whatever I would just open and edit. As it is I have used the print screen method for a few of the more stunning vistas I have seen.
---
Just so you be aware raising your crafting discipline to 500 will Not be the longest Part of this Journey 
---
You need a ton of Mats/gold and pre-crafting/gen2 collection steps 
---
Look Up Guides and dont let it dishearten you If IT Takes a while :)
---
In the meantime If you Like; After aquiring reaper spec you can Go for the reaper collection wich gives you Dark Harvest a pretty awesome acsended GS
---
If it's a trade between 2 accounts not associated with RMT .. she would be fine.  If they bought gold and had it send to her account, then no.
---
I guess those LFGs offering port for skyscale stuff shouldn't be allowed either then right??
---
Such a beautiful world to discover and you run straight past those things :(
---
Also each completed map gives you a black lion chest key!
---
Firebrand also doesn't need to spawn 3 clones before outputting any meaningful damage
---
Wing 5 would make the top for me if not for the two filler events in between the real fights. I would have to go with wing 6 because of the largos fight and the devs encouraging the groups to split to kill the twins. I know portal strat exists but the clearly divided paths takes the cake for me.
---
W1 will always have special place in my heart as it's the one were everything started but one best wing, definitely W5.
---
Humiliation Dye, obviously.
---
Don't you dare touch my HMS Divinity. It's the best legendary in the game.
---
W1 and w2 back when doing mechanics had to be done with more than 2 people. Powercreep, especially PoF one, ruined many parts of the game including raids. W5 along with them as well as last boss of every remaining wing actually feel like raids. Everything else is just a story boss with bigger healthpool or an open world escort.
---
&gt;Oh and what makes you think you are entitled to not play with noobs?
---
The same reason better jobs have higher requirements.  Experience.
---
[removed]
---
In terms of story I really enjoyed the wing 1-3 arc. Talking with Bennett and other NPC to get some clues about what's happening felt really nice and the climax fight atop of the Twisted Castle felt like a great ending. I also liked the fact it was heavily tied to the events of LS3 ep 1 with the White Mantle diaries and all.
---
Though I agree the Mystic Forge is an amazing setting and it's probably the wing I enjoy the most despite hating the Largos Twins xD
---
You're already sitting on the computer. Press PrntScr, tab out and upload the image to reddit. That's just less of a hassle.
---
That asura looks a little bit disappointed she didn't get any top stats.
---
I wager you spelled Quartz wrong due to having a few too many pintz.
---
Dishonor! Dishonor on them! Dishonor on their family! Dishonor on their cow!
---
Wing 2 because I love playing heal necro on sloth with bad groups
---
Most pugs got just better and compositions got optimized. While i wont deny that some of the current specs need dps nerfs hot had also some super op stuff. No meteor shower restriction and air overload being way stronger for example. Hot condi engi had 36k dps for aswell. Condi berserker with multi hits etc.
---
Old druid was also super busted. It had more than double the heal on top of grace of the land, stronger spirit and goe.
---
Around the time they updated the PoF meta events to be in better timers and drop hero choice chests
---
Sometimes finding cosplayers on city maps takes me a whole 5 minute to enjoy the details 😍
---
The Wintersday raid
---
Halloween raid please Anet. ;)
---
I like the opposite. JPs, Vistas are fun... I hate to do those missions...
---
Blade and soul or City of Heroes. Maybe even Lineage. That would be so awesome! Imagine if the game itself played like MOBA and you could play as Rytlock?!
---
W1 -  Each Wing subsequently was worse in one way or another with W7 being the laziest one they've done yet. 
---
I would say the exception is W5 which is basically a sundae dessert spoiled by the two turds that are statues and RR.
---
W6 and 7 are garbage and I hardly even bother doing them these days.
---
If you can, try right after the patch hits next Tuesday.  This will reset all server instances and fixes most stuck events.
---
Glad I’m not the only one who thought this.
---
[Pof-SPOILER] When i played the Pof story and got in the death cutscene where the player dies just in the same Moment i got the Guildactivity Victory sound while My character got Killed by Balthasar
---
I did them one a day in between other stuff. Most take about an hour at most and it was nice reliving the exploration and discovery of the game as there are a lot of places I'd never been back to.
---
He is playing in his computer. So he used his phone to take a pic and used the reddit app so he can do that while playing gw2 still.
---
You call the hearts the easier part ? I'd say it's the other way around  :o
---
Give us [Barioth](https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Monster-Hunter-World/barioth_fix.jpg) as a Strike mission in the Shiverpeaks, Give us its [Armour and Weapon](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D--7oohWwAIc_ux.jpg) and maybe even Barioth as a Raptor Mountskin.  
---
While MHW can have [Samarog](https://massivelyop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03-07-2.png) as a new Raidboss monster as Behemoth replacement for masterrank, crie sin PC masterwait.
---
But maybe it is worth mentioning that those sales were really a lie. The gold to gem conversion rate spiked up so much that the sale prices were the same as the pre-sale prices, when you factored that in.
---
how on earth did you manage to get *only* 18 POIs and 46 WPs after doing all the hearts. what the fuck
---
I got lucky tbh. I went away, did some story missions, came back and got a new map. You just have to hope enough people join the map in your absence so that the server spins up another version. Failing that you can always try immediately after an update, all the maps are spun back up afterwards
---
Wiki, Dulfy, and many other sources have the info you need.
---
Map completion isn’t important if you’re not on the urge to craft any Legendary.
---
And certainly get mounts ASAP as they enhance your in-game experience immensely.
---
Mine are. That means I know how to tilt my head too, so it doesn't hurt my eyes or my neck.
---
Since people just like complaining though.
---
I send a gem refund request for HoT because I was eligible, and I got an answer the same day. But these are fairly easy requests to handle ...

Infusions suck's. Stack all this on one character don't add you good taste!

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.

Cool, thanks for clearing it out! :-)

FFXIV. Where we learn that Tyria is just a very specific shard of FFXIV universe, Commander is basically a Warrior of Light, dragons are just powerful primals with unbound magic being an Aether.

In the chat box, type "/wiki " then Shift+Left-Click an item/skill/waypoint, then hit Enter and it will pull up the Wiki page for that item.  If you're still not sure what to do with it, you can ask for advice from other players.
---
You can level crafting very easily by following https://gw2crafts.net guides.  Crafting isn't a bad way to get gear, but you can also buy lvl 80 Exotic gear from the Trading Post for not too much gold if you want it quicker.
---
If you want to focus on story, here is a [great guide, including supplemental material](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/).  I wouldn't worry about getting 100% map completion first; not necessary, and would be much easier with mounts.
---
WP just started this new series about [builds for open world PvE](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxmChRD2epfS9j4gS8D-tdQbPAajODOv).  Should be a good place to start, but don't be afraid to customize to your tastes once you're comfortable with the game.
---
Welcome back to Tyria!
---
I only at the first zone, and already have 2 [Black Lion Chest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Chest). Was reading you need a Key to open, and those Keys are quite rare to fine. Should I just sell those in the Auction House for now? or because price changes a lot - It's better to stash it in my bank for later use? Is the content being randomized upon opening it? or when picked?
---
We have a very different interpretation of the phrase, a lot. I think there were maybe three or four male heavy armor sets with significant torso exposure. The rest were almost exclusively biceps or shoulders and still that is maybe five more?
---
Women's armor just tends to show more vitals and I wish they could look more like the male ones and vice versa. The two can be vastly different sometimes.
---
After cutting off two of your horns.
---
You'll get some keys from personal story. BLC are basically loot boxes, where the overwhelming majority of content is trash. By themselves, chests are not worth that much anyways, it's the keys that are the bottleneck. (But you can buy those for gems ... of course!).
---
I keep a chest or two around for when I get the odd key, but other than that, don't worry too much about it.
---
Raid fucking content.  Glorified DPS golems with handwaved passes for DPS meters and selling content clears.  What a joke.
---
They freely handwave content that communacatively is as sterile as a lab rat but when it comes to actual interaction with people offering IN GAME CURRENCY AS PAYMENT it's a fucking bannable offense?  
---
It's a fucking MMO.  People are going to pay for shit and interact with each other.  The thin line I could draw in agreement with this is the idea of "advertising payment in LFG" which I think is the only decently justifiable explanation for this.
---
But then you got people selling clears for raids because lol.  This is so stupid.
---
Or Arenanet has shitty management and wasted a lot of money?
---
If you want some help in game, and you're on a US server, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563.  I help a lot of people get back into the game, particularly casual players.
---
Runescape is among the most underrated MMOs out there, period.  The world isn't built around the player at all, the content is based on how YOU as the player progress, and each quest is individually written.
---
When I played WoW and GW2 for the first time (RS being my very first "MMO") I was extremely disappointed by the fact every major map location was essentially a leveling zone, where the levels didn't mean anything because the difference between a level 1 raptor and a level 50 raptor is fucking level scaling.   
---
There's no "low level" demons (barring the small shitasses) in Runescape.  When you encounter a demon they're way higher leveled and actually pose a threat relative to their stance in the world. In most MMOs the only thing that matters is the fucking number next to their name.  
---
Personal story aside, I'd love to see GW2 oriented in the same fashion.  Starting as level 1 as a charr you'd be a fresh or lowly grunt in the legions.  Or a level 1 human, sylvari, nord just starting on their adventure.  A level 1 asura as a poor, unpaid intern at a crew doing menial tasks.
---
Orient GW2's world so that none of the more fantastical monsters appear in low level zones.  Hell do away with "level zones" entirely.  In the wilderness near villlages and cities make stuff level 1 through 10.  But that random cave underneath Kryta?  Level 30 bandits.  Suddenly those bandits have a lot more weight in the world and you realize they pose a threat, to you and your inexperienced ass.  Suddenly location and setting carry more weight and become significant.  But then the rewards would also be more significant from higher leveled enemies.  
---
It just pains me to see that numbers mean nothing in GW2 (and the majority of MMOs) and aren't used to define the world but are rather purely as a sterile marker of progression.
---
W4 because I can effortlessly clear first three bosses with my casual friends and then not even touch Daimos guy because I'm too laid back and casual for that.
---
Ugh my charr is basically rocking all pyre and I love it. Such a good dye.
---
Also shout-out to the entire winter chimes dye kit, which slaps my whole bod. Amazing metallic dyes.
---
NEKOPARA ... for reasons ...
---
Remember when people actually complained about shit being grindy like 10 years ago?
---
The skyscale (and a huge portion of end game GW2 content) is literally the definition of a grind.
---
The little gear icon in the top right of your inventory window has the option to "deposit materials" which sends almost anything you can craft with to the materials tab of your bank. That can really help lighten the load in your bags. Don't even worry about selling that stuff off right now; keep it until you either want to do some crafting or make some money off the TP. 
---
On a related note, it's rare to sell anything to the merchant that isn't a grey junk item. Most stuff can be either salvaged into materials, or sold on the TP.
---
It's on the gem store on a 100% sale, so yiu get it for free if you only think to check the gemstore and click the right thing.
---
Or at least, that was the case à week ago. I don't know if it's still on.
---
How did you manage hitting so few Points of Interest? That's impressive as heck.
---
1 thing to say.
---
Pig magic....
---
I feel sloth would be a better fit for mh than samarog.
---
dont wvw ones also get unlocked?
---
Its because of the Krait shard home instance hero point. The scrolls are likely coded to give you x hero point unlocks, where x is the total number of hero points necessary for 100% map completion. But thanks to the home instance one, this number is actually x + 1. The issue arises because the home instance hero point is still counted as central tyria, thus counts to that total limit the scrolls have.
---
No matter if you have channeled the krait shard in your home instance by hand or not, because of it you'll never finish all central tyria hero point challenges by scrolls. There will always be one left out and you have a 1 in (x +1) chance that this one left out hero point is the home instance one, but a x in (x + 1) chance that it is any of the map completion relevant hero points.
---
Thematically? Wing 4 definitly, I really digged the Saul story, as well as the visual design of Samarog and Deimos. W5 is very nice and nostalgic as well, but since I have not static raiding groups, my experiences with PUGging Dhuum are just too painfull...
---
But my favorite boss overall is probably Matthias, he felt the most rewarding way back when I did my first W2 clear.
---
A fresh character will always run into this issue because of the krait shard home instance hero point alone. It may be possible to further increase the left over amount with Dry Top and Silverwastes hero points.
---
I'm editing my post, dude. :D
---
Wing 5 definitely.
---
The challenge is there. I have yet to have another feeling like killing Dhuum for the first time with pugs.
---
The rewards. Oblivion is still one of the best staff skins, the throne is still my favorite chair, and mini Dhuum is one of the coolest minis.
---
The atmosphere. Dhuum is the most intimidating boss out of any of the raids.
---
I wish W6 and W7 had lived up to W5.
---
Smough
---
Worth noting old benchmarks were done with all buffs.
---
Yes, thats a beautiful place as well. And I just love the skritts, they are so cute.

It has precedent - bunny thumpers from GW1 were great build.

- if you're worried about low grade gear, there are other ways to obtain exotics that might be more appropriate;
---
- story: ideally you'd do it chronologically. You can jump directly into the first Pof mission and get the raptor with negligible spoilers. It will take months and many gems, assuming you have nothing from S3 and S4 unlocked;
---
- map completion is convenient and required for a legendary, but that is it.
---
For me this is where the fun part starts..
---
Anything "realistic" like the Witcher to get rid of all the clowns that have polluted the game with their ugly ass outfits and auras
---
&gt; (It should have nothing to do with the money involved; afaik)
---
The gold is the only relevant point. You can ask for all the help you want. You can't offer to buy or sell it though in LFG.
---
Roger that
---
Ionia is cantha
---
Also i can't think of anyone more fitting than lissandra to be jormag's right hand
---
&gt; How do I know what to do with all them? What should I keep, what is good to salvage, what to use, and what I can sell?
---
The wiki is a good resource for that. It'll tell you which items are unique, which are discardable, which are sellable ...
---
&gt; Also, last time I played I got a little bit into crafting (lvl 175, just scratched the surface) and I wanted to go back to it now as well. My thief keeps using lvl 60+ gear and I get beat up a lot. What's the best resource to quickly understand and guide me in crafting?
---
Players don't craft randomly discovering things, they follow a guide 1-400 or 1-500. [GW2Crafts](https://gw2crafts.net/) is the usually recommended resource.
---
&gt; Lastly, I've never finished the story in Guild Wars 2, and I'm contemplating buying DLC's - should I complete main story first? Is the DLC's story directly connected? And should I reach 100% map completion first (currently at around 50% on two different characters)? I just want to get the new classes and mounts, but also curious about the new maps! 
---
You're not forced to complete story and maps first before buying the expansions. It's up to you what you want to play and focus on everyday. As a little tip, if you didn't buy the core game (and thus are still F2P), you're not cumulating daily and anniversary rewards. So if you intend to stick to the game, the sooner you buy the better, as there is no subscription.
---
DLC's story is directly connected yes.
---
Current story order:
---
- personal story,
---
- LW1 -&gt; dynamic events, now unplayable,
---
- LW2 -&gt; 8 episodes, to buy,
---
- Heart of Thorns (HoT) -&gt; expansion, offered if you buy PoF,
---
- LW3 -&gt; 6 episodes, to buy,
---
- Path of Fire (PoF) -&gt; expansion,
---
- LW4 -&gt; 6 episodes, to buy (last one free if you log in while it's up).
---
&gt; Any direction (specifically with the items and crafting) would be really appreciated, thank you!
---
Crafting is useful, but not the only source of gear in this game, especially endgame with ascended rarity (the highest possible stats). Taking two crafting disciplines corresponding to your current character's needs would be a good start. You can create more characters for further disciplines.
---
Just reminded me of season 2 with Caithes memory of Wynn. My mini quaggan in bed sheet ghost outfit wondered into the scene
---
or actually make use of the dodge mechanic! :P
---
hmmm yes. they also have a fanged Beast skeleton now so it can work.
---
I chose **WoW** only for:
---
* **Mounts** (I only talk about skins, differentiation and the possibility of unlocking new skins with achievements, quests, vendors, crafting ... not only gemstore).
---
* **Biome differentiation** ( in gw2 there are very few biomes and all are very realistic biomes. While WoW has many totally fantasy biomes (forests of giant mushrooms, air-suspended islands, infernal lands, dark forests, crystal forests, bioluminescent environments, and much more) .
---
* **Lore** ( Only a few years ago. Lately the beautiful lore that WoW had came much less).
---
* **Playable Races** (only 5 playable races are very few).
---
* **Fishing**
---
I chose **Conan Exiles** only for:
---
* **Base construction** (it would be perfect if in guild wars 2 i could build my base as in conan, recruit soldiers, and then defend it from hordes of mobs).
---
* **Action combat** ( I love the gw2 action camera, but having a much more action combat would be great, even if it's not possible)
---
**Thats all!**
---
Even as a primarily wvw player i dont think you should skip on t4 fractals. With cms it takes an hour,even less depending on maps and you average about 30-40g depending on rng daily. I think in gw2 you have to play multiple modes for the game to feel rewarding. I have a raid day with my static, usually do fracs and the rest is wvw roaming, so i get my wvw fix but manage to always stay above 1000g. Fractals also help change gear without paying much gold because of chest drops.
---
Nothing. Endgame armor should stay obtainable through crafting and non gold currencies only
---
I’m at work so can’t really check the map here, do you mean _inside_ the Lion’s Arch map?
---
did you intentionally avoid all waypoints? I expected you get more of them only by goring from heart to heart.
---
Is there any cool content for players that are in a 6-9 squad? We can't make full 10 or 5 to go to fractals so I was wondering what you can do in such a group besides World Boss rotation. :)
---
Leggie armor is not soulbound, its about convenience
---
Tbh most hardcore raiders i know that play raids exclusively have 2-3 accounts while also doing fractals on multiple accounts, then send all their gold to main.Its a lot of gold overall. Its not as rewarding as flipping but it keeps you motivated to play your favourite mode without bleeding money for consumables. Alt accounts usually have cheap exotic gear so not much gold needed there.
---
Fighting Balthazar is LS3 as a human elementalist was an interesting experience. "Feel the fires of Balthazar!" "Balthazar, give me strength!"
---
Map specific Armor/Weapon skins
---
They aren't meant to be useful for endgame. They are meant to be useful for newer players while they level up.
---
Coming from a game where every race is a reskin of human (swtor), I fell in love with the charr. They were *different*, they actually ran on all fours, how cool was that?
---
Still cool as heck, still love the murder kitties.
---
Yes, I avoided as many as possible
---
I did ask if other people see this. 
---
Stop being petty.
---
Weapons in Warframe have a visibility toggle.  They also have a ton of options for manual positioning.  If you don't like how a weapon is placed, or how it looks on your character, they give you a lot of options.  Anet could learn a thing or two from DE.
---
WvW runs so much better than PVE.  Though I haven't been in since before they added the Warclaw so maybe that's changed.  All the mounts, mount skins, chairs, legendary bling, etc etc. really pulverize the FPS.
---
why shouldnt other players be able to see the same players you see?
---
The game is literally free to play, ofc people will try it out, what's there to lose?
---
I really like Wing 7 as a whole since the bosses feel much more agnostic to damage types (condi vs power) than Wing 5 and 6. I enjoy not being pressured to play something I dislike. I also enjoy the option for true boon thief tanking on Adina where timing evades and blocks feels like it can have a major impact on how smooth a run is. Reminds of active Death Knight tanking from way back when in WoW. The variation of comps that can be used on the first two bosses is an absolute breath of fresh air after having to play the character select screen so much in Wing 5 and 6.
---
Finally, I really enjoying having a kiting mechanic that shares responsibility, keeps people engaged with the actual boss and not playing a mini game and can be salvaged if someone fails.
---
However, it isn't difficult enough. If I am wanting a touch more a challenge I prefer Wing 5 with Dhuum as my favourite normal encounter.  Samarog CM wins for the CM encounters with Adina CM close behind because seeing people fall in holes and die is funny.
---
Grats! Raids as much as you can (1 kill per boss each week. No reason to kill the same boss twice) fractal dailies every day. Meta events in HoT and PoD maps for the gemstone. Sell what you don't need but what you do
---
PoF and LS4 Bounties are a good pick for this party size. Maybe some legendaries will be a bit annoying but champions will be very enjoyable because they will not have scaled (or not too much).
---
If you are closer to the 9 than the 6 you could also technically try your hand at some raid bosses. Sure being 10 helps a lot but some are not too problematic to do with less than 10. You can also finish the group with 1-2 random people from LFG and that shouldn't be too much of an issue for your group as long as you advertise your group appropriately in LFG (ie. "training" if you are beginners).
---
The problem is that its too repetitive for me.  I enjoyed raids because they felt different but I got tired of the same 2 people always screwing it up for the rest of us because they failed to see mechanics.  I could never get into fractals or dungeons though.  It was just stacking on a boss while maxing my DPS before doing it to the next one.  It got old really quick.  I think my fractal level is maybe 14?  Maybe if I had a solid group of friends where we could joke around and such while we completed them it would be different but that ship sailed years ago.
---
Not all merchants are meant to be useful. Many of them are there just to add some flavor and depth to the game world.
---
My mini plush gryphon somehow ended up way in the foreground of that shot, and did its sit-and-doze animation which made it look sad about the tragedy unfolding behind it.
---
All good my friend, its just frustrating, cant do anything, and alredy got stuff for legendaries. Feelsbadman
---
New player here (started on Sep 8).
---
I'm pretty experienced MMO player, so it wasn't that hard to understand basics.
---
First impressions:
---
1. Large number of people in starting locations. I'm currently lv30, still no problem to do any events because there's always someone else around.
---
2. Unlike large number of other MMOs, GW still gives you a chance to find how game works through experimentation. Lack of in-game explanation of mechanics is a bonus for me. On the other hand, plenty of guides online on any topic.
---
3. I like the combat system so far (started as a thief). Seems like in late-game there will be a plenty of viable builds which are skill-dependent, so top equipment or OP class is not an auto-win.
---
4. Story sucks so far.
---
In general I like the game and don't want to use lv80 booster - it is fun enough to level up for the first time.
---
Red, green or purple one?
---
All of them
---
Ive got friends that recently joined and no one is leaving due to a dungeon, let me tell you
---
Do the adventures. They give a ton of experience when you get gold for the first time.
---
Map metas are also good. Not sure about PoF, but Hot metas give something between 150k and 300k experience in about 15 minutes (the time it takes to do the meta). The only exception being Dragon's Stand
---
Yeah, looks like it is still a thing, cause one guy was passing by that hp, and said, "they cant fix this for one year lmao", that actually scares me a bit xD
---
At least they could have add a collection for all recipes.. for poor idiots like me who keeping unlocking everything. (my poor crafting UI..)
---
I see More people tío
---
Earning gold has no cap, as far as we know.
---
However, you can only send a specific amount of gold each week to someone which is 500g.
---
&gt; There is a weekly limit of 500 gold that you can accept through the mail system. Gold will be held in your inbox until it can be collected. [source](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mail)
---
Oh my god I had the same, though it happened if PoF when my character died (and before getting to the Mist). It kinda killed the feeling tho.
---
Does the same happen with the guild armor where you can see the guild emblem?
---
Oh boy I had the same happen to me! It kinda killed the mood tbh.
---
Super-productive achievement: Greenback Earner.
---
Cut a few lawns, sit a few babies. The quest-giver can be found in practically EVERY neighborhood in the (real) world, and will reward the adventurer with the local (real world) currency, which can then be converted to gems!
---
And it's repeatable, too!
---
Fractals also count for the Central Tyria experience and you get a bunch when finishing one.
---
Back in the days when the masteries came out people were farming Central Tyria experience in pof p1 since you can get an unlimited amount of enemies in the room before the bossfight through activating the circles and killing the enemies spawning.
---
There is a 500 gold per week limit from mail. See https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mail#Mechanics
---
I wish there was a metallic infusion that kept your colour scheme but just made you shiny
---
Its an mmo, everything is repetitive,even in wvw you end up doing the same stuff over and over. As you said its the people that keep you active in the game. Even the most boring and mundane content like guild missions is entertaining when playing with friends.
---
Pencil --&gt; Scrap of note paper --&gt; password SAVED.
---
You just reduced customer support's workload by one unnecessary task.
---
Go have a beer!
---
Is that a Mike Z cosplay?
---
Wait just in my inbox? like where?
---
Because I can't see the remaining gold anywhere.
---
And whats weirder then is that is the first time someone sended gold to me D:
---
Well I mean, everything in life is repetitive at some point, its not just tied to MMOs or gaming.  My point was that content like dungeons and fractals is just too repetitive.  5 people moving 20 feet to kill a boss only to move 20 more feet and do it again isn't my idea of fun.  I'm not bashing anyone who does enjoy it, don't get me wrong.  Its just not for me.  I can see how people don't enjoy WvW though too.  The running to a fight only to die and do it again does indeed suck but when you get a really good fight, it makes it all worth it.
---
What if the vendors offered to add specific runes / sigills to your weapons/armor. (fitting to the level of the area / no exotics or only very specific ones like "ogre slaying sigil" while in oger territory, ect.)? Now every new player would always check out those dudes, maybe one of them has a rly good sigil to offer, which fit your build / playstyle.
---
Also let them have certain karma weapon / armor skins or crafting skins (would only make sense, for them to have these kind of skins in their store). Now you can either do the heart and get the skin for karma or you go buy it right away, because you're too lazy to do the heart. (Could lead to some lvl80 players run around and collect all the missing skins, without having to do heart quests first)
---
If they'd also offer a limitted amount of certain materials (daily limit), this could be an awesome addition as well. Let them sell it below TP prizes and maybe we gonna see people reach out to those merchants and buy some of their goods DAILY.
---
\--------------
---
Taddaaaa, everybody likes those merchants now. :)
---
I'm a fan of the female asura's "Oh, what a pleasant surprise!" when receiving a bandit death mark.
---
I always thought the hearts were the worst part
---
The story doesn't get any better so don't get your hopes up.
---
I do key runs every week and i have not really seen a bigger influx of players it simply always is busy in the start area and a constant flow of new players. Some are ofc key of the week player as me but you can spot them from miles ahead :)
---
Level 10? I already level 13 and never got a key..
---
Not?
---
The past weeks I stormed through season 3, 4 and PoF and always got a key for each map.
---
... this is turning into the most boring copypasta meme ever
---
sPvP  5v5 you can jump in and do now already. Gear is normalized in sPvP and you get scaled up to lvl 80 with everything unlocked including the elitespecs from expansions if you own them.
---
The only thing in PvP you need to pay attention too is the pvp tab on your upper screen were you add build, weapons, runes/sigils and a amulet. This is what will determind your game play in sPvP matches.
---
For WvW you can join this as well and you will be upscaled BUT the upscale do not unlock anything so you will still have what you have unlocked in PvE and the scaling is not really working very well and the things you did not unlock yet will be missing out. Which put you in a vulnereble state were you will die a lot faster then anyone else which might rally enemies up. You also do not get xp in WvW but you get tomes of knowledge when you rank up. Not as fast to level as in PvE but sometimes it can be fun to try new things out and change the view.
---
But if you join WvW whilst being upscaled make sure you run in the back and avoid as much damage as possible, buff your allies if you can, ress in the back if you are not in danger and aoe and cc were you can. When you hit lvl 80 and get proper gear and build you can throw your self in there and be what ever you want. Join teamspeak/Discord that your sever have and it will be even more fun in fights.
---
As for roaming in WvW as upscale well i would not suggest that really. It will likely end up with you being frustrated so waith with that until you hit lvl 80.
---
Guild wars 1 because the two share nothing besides name.
---
He's talking about the fact that this same question has been posted several times a day for at least a week and clearly nobody searches this subreddit before posting.
---
Can I give you my account for a week and just let you have your fun?
---
/r/titlegore
---
I did actually do a search, I just ended up searching for the wrong thing ("inventory bug" or something like that), so I didn't get any hits.
---
And then once someone helpfully pointed out that I could search for "trophy" I found what I was looking for. 
---
Stupid oversight on my part not to check New - I'm sorry for ruining everyone's day by asking something that's been asked already.
---
Didn't spot that :p
---
I approve of that. If it's not purple, I don't want it!
---
I love the setting of 4, it feels like a completely different take on the game, where the enemies and the mysteries are very unique and there is a very satisfying payoff in the end.
---
You don't need to search anything, it is literally on the new frontpage.
---
Everytime this kind of thing happens i always imagine this person who just alt tab from the game, and then windslam make a thread on reddit without even so much giving a thought.
---
Other way around, they should make everything less flashy.
---
My eyes hurts when I'm in LA.
---
Just make cool skins no need for the blinding lights everywhere.
---
There's still room for tweaks from the optimal raid setup. Power chrono for example can take Persistence of Memory and suddenly you have a ton of boons.
---
“Doc, im back from the future!”
---
“Great Scott!” *faints*
---
No it doesn't.
---
&gt;"There would be a LOT of system optimization. (Some of you don't know you want this, BUT YOU WANT THIS)"
---
Uh... are you talking about PoE on this?
---
The game is running like crap for top end pcs for *years*. What are you talking about system optimization? Or did I misunderstood completely?
---
I wouldn't say it ruined my day, it happens. I'm glad you got an answer.
---
I think that this can be a stupid question, but i didnt see this info anywhere. My question is, if i buy the game (standard version), will the future expansion be free?
---
Plus sloth has good movesets too which work well with mh such as poison, slams, fire breath and an Aoe of hurt. It also helps that it can fit into the Ancient Forest biome with relative ease.
---
can we stop asking this question now?
---
I would not put so much blame on quality when it comes to people quitting. From my point of view, the lack of dungeon updates mean that they are still the same content I enjoyed when the game came out. They did not cause me to quit.
---
A lot of people quit back in the day too. Yes, of course they would slander the game, and yes they did say some thing that were true. However, the real reason they left is that the game just didn't click with them. No amount of bug fixing could have solved that.
---
It's just a normal thing that happens.
---
W3, the concept is really cool, storming a castle to end the WM, and the ending lead really nice into LS3. W1-W3 just has really great story-telling in general though
---
Can you use a search function? This has been posted multiple times per day since the bug came out.
---
...what issue? What is the harm in making them actual merchants? It's good to be able to sell stuff, so why can't some of those generic Merchants be labeled Blacksmith instead for RP reasons?
---
&gt; They do seem to respawn super fast, after gathering them i went to grab the hidden stashes on the jumping puzzle to open the chest, and by the time i had looked them up on the wiki &amp; grabbed them (around 10mn I'd say ? I was half-afk), the nodes had respawned !
---
Yeah I don't know what to say.  I haven't bothered timing them, but I have farmed them on 3 characters, swapped to a fourth who then did a 10min match in PvP, only to come back and be able to farm them all over again.
---
I typically will farm them when I log in, any time I decide to switch characters, and just as I am about to log out.   I figure I'm farming up at least 1-3 peppercorns a day, and at least as many seasame, all without having to actually move around on a map.
---
I expect ANET to nerf this eventually, as we aren't allowed to have fun things, so enjoy it while it's around.
---
Someone who simply can't find a weapon of the type they want for their level. 
---
It's a safety net. Your weapons are your main skills, after all.
---
Thought he was misspelling Goose
---
Team Lara Croft
---
Also, it would be nice to have that high-quality screenshot feature that saves a better-than-max-graphics BMP screenshot.
---
Except that Charr looks like he is wearing a diaper...
---
The thing is that in this game you can ignore personal story altogether.
---
It is just safety net for those who would be absolutely lost, it really isn't anything bad. If you would make them more interesting, you would devalue the loot drops.
---
*The technology just isn't there yet.*
---
There is no way to save your slot in an instance, and I'm sure both fanboys and a (rare) dev will make up dozens of excuses as to why, but the reality is that there are no devs who could code it. DCs happen rarely, but they can cause hours of lost effort. Something as simple as reserving spot for 3-5 minutes after sudden loss of connectivity (genuine DC or pulling the plug intentionally) doesn't matter, because to truly exploit it would take dozens of players cooperating, and that's just not possible when the majority doesn't even know how to break a fucking break bars on bosses.
---
And yet the only person that needs to go still sits in the president's chair.
---
You can finish the bars even after bosses die, the timer to zero is the relevant thing there. You stil lcan do events or bring supplies to camps to get it.
---
But usually it is easier to just organize well through the first part of the night, spread around the map properly and defend as many outposts as possible.
---
You should join the Anet marketing team
---
That's not the sum total by any stretch. In that time there's dozens of ascended weapon and armor chests, t6 mats, mystic clovers, gifts of battle, dungeon tokens and on and on. I also pve, and between the two have about 15 legendary weapons and a full set of legendary armor.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Nope. Map completion does not always reward a key.
---
The biggest reason for 40 is to get the level 30 rewards as well. You get the Order weapons chest, which all cost 3-5 gold or so in skins apiece.
---
You had me at drink!
---
Wing 6 for sure. The wing itself is beautiful af and i like the bosses. Especially Largos and Qadim feel very dynamic and action-packed
---
&gt; The other 9 people are doing the content. In a group.
---
But **you** are not, which is the point you was trying to make.
---
Your just further twisting everything to fit your narrative and giving niche examples like a single achievement to justify it existing there (But still nothing about living story!)
---
This conversation is a waste of time because in your eyes, daddy anet can't do anything wrong. 
---
Peace.
---
Except in this game EVERY merchant is absolutely useless. They only exist to guy gathering tools from and to sell junk to.
---
Provisioner tokens, but people hated that. We're not going to get any useful ideas in this forum, or we would've seen these ideas in other MMOs already.
---
I mean full glass xd what is that kind of build?:o
---
Strangely there was a time where I TP’d into Dragon Stand before the event started only to find that I was on a map that had just killed Mordremoth and was running around killing Treasure Mushrooms. I was surprised because I thought I wasn’t supposed to be able to join that late.
---
Oh yea, grinding stones / oils would make a lot of sense as well! Or they just straight up grant you the boon for some $$$.
---
That's really weird. How long ago was this? Was this changed?
---
...you and I have very different definitions of "fun"
---
INVENTORY IS FULL
---
"You can never have too much treasure!"
---
"Sweet, sweet, loot!"
---
*looks at junk item* Okay...
---
Perfect, ty for all the info :)
---
This is off the top of my head so I might be off on something:
---
All heavy armor on norn.
---
Head: Funerary (PoF)
---
Shoulders: Eagle (norn cultural t2)
---
Chest: Elegy (Jahai bluffs)
---
Gloves: Eagle
---
Legs: Dolyak (norn cultural t1)
---
Boots: Elegy
---
Back: Siren's Landing Grenth Backpack
---
Dyes are a mix of Abyssal Forest, Gunmetal and Ominous Yellow I think.
---
Thanks for the compliment!
---
It works with any way you buy it, however be sure you buy from official retailers. Getting the key from (fraud) reseller sites will just make your account banned.
---
There’s no reason we can’t have both though. The current type of vendor could easily be just available I can main cities so people can gear up, that way actual vendors could be more than just a place to free up inventory space.
---
Wing 4, because 4 bosses and no event. Normal fights are easy even for pugs and CM's are decent challenge for hardcores. And it has the best lore and story!
---
Looking good! And very nice angle on the screenshot.
---
I think part of it is a few MMOs out there are dying, so there is a shuffle of players going around. I recommend trying to keep these new players we are seeing engaged and interested in some aspect of the game. The main thing is communication. Crack their shells
---
I hate it, and never once considered them heroes.
---
Back when I used to do guild JP events, I had a strict rule of no portals. People hated it at first and thanked me for it later.
---
Do you know why? It's quite simple really.
---
When you get hard carried through anything, there's zero self-improvement. How does one intend on ever improving on something if they do not even bother trying it till they succeed? You fall so you can learn to get back up...by yourself.
---
If you never intend on improving yourself, then that's fine - but at that point, you lose ALL right to ever complain about anything; and let's face it...that's not how it works, because people LOVE to complain and feel entitled to do so.
---
"Rude Asuran" I see what you did there.
---
I like the boon idea karma vendors; would help with map completion users and dailies. Neat idea.
---
You accidentally triggered the mirror force trap card
---
Anet and revisiting old content. Name a more uniconic duo.
---
I mean it's true that gear is pretty useless while leveling. It's more a flavor/rp thing. Always weird to see every blacksmiths only selling basic skin whites.
---
I‘d love it if every vendor sells just some random special item, maybe some kind of trophy. It doesnt have to be something big, just an item thats git something to do with the character / his location
---
It's annoying to do, no thanks.
---
Midway in tequatl makes it a no-no.
---
Downvoters can’t detect the sarcasm.
---
please tell me you're being sarcastic
---
&gt; "Feel the fires of Balthazar!"
---
Didn't they remove that and replace it with "NOW BURN" or something?
---
Fruits?
---
I got my character to interrupt herself when opening daily loot a while ago:
---
"Just another confirmation of sweet, sweet loot."
---
Just because you've seen a handful of lowbies doesn't mean there is an influx of new players.
---
New players come and go all the time in F2P games.
---
Also just coz they're in a low level zone, doesn't mean they new players. Alts, map completion and key farming are all reasons a player might already be there.
---
I’ve only really played rev while leveling, so won’t have great advice but at least it’s something. Mace/axe demon stance is, as I recall, condi focused, which isn’t as good in general leveling. Condis match/exceed power dmg when you get full value out of them ticking through, but with weak enemies they’re just way way slower than power, meaning many more hits to you. With that in mind, either try to kite enemies during combat so that you can stretch out the fight until the condis can kill them, or switch up your weapon set. Sw/sw is the highest straight power dmg you can do, and is easy to use for survival. 3 is an evade, one of them is an immob, and you get a lot of dmg on the auto
---
Also try training dwarf stance, the skill that makes the hammers swinging around you gives you dmg reduction while active
---
Well maybe so, but I bet he doesn't talk much about Clowr island.

There kind of is if you do the collection for juggernaut.
---
Honestly, the charm in GW1 wins out because of the era it was made in. It was peak early 2000s PC fantasy RPG writing, so I'm able to give it a better pass for how weird and stilted the writing can be.
---
GW2 doesn't really have that as an excuse, given what it originally propped itself up to be during launch trailers/reveals and that manifesto, and the era of game storytelling that surrounded it and claims to be influenced by.
---
They did sometime after this:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVsl-xt01_U
---
I don't think it'll matter until they overhaul gear/stats entirely, but that isn't going to happen.
---
The very standard stat-set + preset numbers/values/combinations that are identical across the game kind of killed these vendors since launch.
---
If you're level 20, **you're likely taking on enemies that are too high over your character level** for your personal skill level. You're using condi (mace/axe with mallyx) solo in open world PvE which in general is subpar - builds that excel solo utilize power dps (in rev's case, sword/sword with shiro). Using condi, fights will drag out longer and you'll have more opportunities to die. Dodging is the single greatest surviveability tool for any class in PvE, seems obvious but you'd be surprised. Rev also has a lot of damage reduction on dwarf stance (vengeful hammers, rite of the great dwarf).
---
Also at level 20 your gear is lacking, so it's especially important to pay attention to the level of the area you're in.
---
There's a lot of funny stuff in this game.  Let's see...
---
In the Domain of Vabbi there's [an event](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Use_items_found_around_the_palace_to_help_restore_ruined_art_and_antiques_before_the_Awakened_inspector_arrives) in Vehjin Palace where you can mix your own paint, throw it on wall-hung paintings, and generally destroy all the fine art as part of an effort to make things look nice before an Awakened inspector arrives.  The vapid snobby nobles will positively comment on your work while your character gives brief responses.  It had me rolling the first few times I played through it, and it still gives me a chuckle when I repeat the heart for rewards.
---
Hammer, zerk gear, dragon stance. Engage the enemy from max range for hammer skill 2. For hero challenges, use hammer 3 to avoid the big attacks and make sure both hammer 5 gets used. They can't hurt you when they're on their ass. Remember that the dragon heal skill converts damage to healing, so pop it while standing in damage then get the hell out. If things get too ugly, swap to dwarf, pop the heal, drop the yellow brick road, and get away.
---
Hey, I'm not your friend, pal.
---
This meme is easily 5 years old, if not older.
---
Why discover...?  
---
It is long established that humans are from another world and where brought to tyria by their gods (at least the tyrian. The canthean came like a few hundret years earlier on their own somehow)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The only open questions are WHY they came.
---
Some theories say that their original world was destroyed by something and that the gods safed parts of humankind by leading them through the mists to some neighbouring world... Our tyria.
---
You can achieve T4 by getting to T2 (50-75% towards T3) during the first bit then doing all the bosses. After and during the bosses you can still upgrade camps to get to T4. It's important to get as many camps to T5 as possible. Try and stay with 2-3 people max at 1 camp. Often explaining it in /m will help. If your quick with the bosses and lack a bit towards T4 upgrade camps, escort npc's, etc. The tier counts at the very end when you get the reward so you could make it 1s before timers ends. Hope this helps a bit!
---
I always recommend to follow story. It will take you through almost all core maps and all dlc maps. Doing story (if you have unlocked living story chapters) will unlock for you extra 12 maps to explore! Not counting expansion maps. 
---
While exploring new zones take a look on achievement panel for map or story chapter you are in. Maybe there are rewards you'd like to get? And there are plenty! Ascended items, 32 slot bags, mounts.
---
Have fun!

Convert t5 to t6, farm volatile magic, buy trophy chests.
---
Aww :(
---
Fashion community sucks tbh
---
That is convenient
---
&gt;  Meanwhile each map is filled with side story's lore and stuff to farm. I guess many Players either don't care or don't know.
---
Even if you were to lick every wall and corner for hidden bits of lore, you'd still only get *maybe* a dozen hours out of each living world update. Even then. why would I invest that time in living world when I could sit down and play a single player RPG with high quality story content?
---
The problem is the game is lacking fun/rewarding repeatable content. That's why vets are quitting.
---
The other 9 people are.  Anet doesn't appear to care what people do with group content.  But raids are group content, and there for completely allowable in looking for GROUP.  What's really funny is that I kind of think anet's a pile of failure, and that GW2 succeeds despite anet's best efforts to the contrary.  But you just label me a white knight because it's easier than admitting you're wrong.
---
Now you can play the game lol
---
They can’t use dragon stance quite yet since they’re level 20...
---
Put some clothes on man
---
On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”
---
“That’s the display department.”
---
“With a flashlight.”
---
“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”
---
“So had the stairs.”
---
“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”
---
“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard.'
---
You know what else ain't rocket science?  Bell curves.  They're taught in elementary school.  They are used to visualize distribution.
---
You just said yourself that the material is not needed by Most People.  That's the first thing you got right!  Congratulations!  A material that is not needed by Most People means they aren't consuming it.  That translates into Most People having a supply of it, not stacks of it, but the majority of how the material is distributed.
---
There is no reason there can't be a sink.  It would create a need for Most People since Most People are not hurting for the material.  Most People are in the middle of the bell curve of distribution.
---
And that's how you use simple reasoning and common sense without knowing the actual data, not whatever simplistic reasoning you're using.
---
Thanks so much for the quick response! Now I'm off to free up 15 bank slots!
---
It's a open world build for lazy people who just want to get through PvE or want to tackle difficult stuff solo. 
---
&gt; Rabid stats only makes like no sense at all
---
Sharper Images gives bleeding from crits, not just yours but your clones also. In full rabid with undead runes I can keep 25 stacks of bleeding on (Legendary) Bounties in PoF.
---
Just use Jalis for levelling. It is so easy with Sword/Axe. I perdonally use Ventari's as well because i like the switch utility it provides, but that is up to you. Hammers on Jalis are superior for the passive heals.
---
Blah, you're supposed to say, "I'm not your pal, buddy!"
---
wing 2 cos Matthias is still the best boss
---
That looks better
---
Bo isn't that much of an investment.  More of time than anything else.  I'd advise working towards it rather than going to Artificer just for an Ascended staff.
---
The Mystic Coins needed for the Mystic Staff are the big cost, but you get them for free as login rewards.  Of course, if you'd rather go with Artificer in the end, then you can use those Mystic Coins that are sitting in your collectibles tab to fund that 50 gold for Artificer 400-500 instead.  I still think pursuing Bo is the wiser course, but either way works.
---
Hammer 4 is a niche ability.  It's good that you're paying attention to specifics, but a lot of "legacy" content from 2012 is inconsistent (it hasn't been touched in years) meaning interactions are bizarre sometimes.  Hammer 5 is a 2s knockdown (crowd-control) meaning you can use it to interrupt or harass annoying foes.  It can add a fun mini-game to combat.
---
Those are very realistic to me.
---
Some residents really do go almost every day to pick up things from outside trash bins. I can watch it from window. Funny thing is, I do that too. Rich people leave more or less valuable things.
---
Family members often come check what I am doing, open drawers etc. and take/read things without permission. "I borrow this, will return it soon! :)" [never returns]. Why most of my letters are pre-opened? Why my things are in different places after I come back home?
---
Service man stole a small decoration item from table. He hasn't come back ever since.
---
I don't have a wallet. Everything is gone if someone steals a wallet. That's why I have my bank cards, driving licences, cash etc. in many separate pockets and/or drawers. Password paper might drop in grocery store when taking something from wallet.
---
Too many risks. I try to remember all my passwords instead, which is getting more difficult when growing older.
---
&gt;craftable percursors (you need to do lot of stuff around core maps)
---
They've stopped doing that for a while now.
---
EU, but got it done, thanks to all :)
---
One of the amusing chatter combinations I ecountered:
---
female sylvari: *"This rose has... Glorious combination of skills!"*
---
Then there was the time when I was in the Grove with my female norn, opening unid gear.
---
In the background a charr NPC is telling a couple of innocent sylvari about the realities of war:
---
*"The wading through gore. The blood that stains your claws."*
---
Then my character randomly goes: *"I like it!"*
---
xD
---
Gw2efficiency is good too, you can connect yourself with your API and then it will show you exactly how much gold you still need and what do you need to buy.
---
No. Achievements in GW2 are similar to achievements in other games in that they are things to do to extend the longevity of playing it. But also Achievements are the way that GW2 implements what would be "quests" in other MMOs. In a quest-like Achievements the descriptions will make references to PoIs instead of blatant "go here".
---
argh the *"Statistically speaking, this is rather rare."* line for every piece of rare gear she gets - it's not rare ffs, I get a ton of those every day 😩
---
I think all fire magic originally comes from Balthazar, so your just giving him back his shit during the break up.
---
Two heals? :O oh right, i can switch stances during fights... just assigned my mouse to it. That's really good to know.
---
It really is. This way I can send someone a pack of salt and then block him. Leaving them no other option as to remove it from their mail.
---
your character is a sadist xD
---
finding the right gear is currently the most difficult thing. I find mostly things I don't need.
---
There's personal story each 10 levels and heart vendors also have some gear.
---
Karma is the most common currency so there's no point in saving it. You'll have milions of it later on.
---
Guild Wars 1. A lot of us GW1 vets really hoped the GW2 would be somewhat like GW1 (in how skills, builds, multi-professions work, etc.), just updated and modernized a bit to have a jump axis, and more.
---
None? They're aren't necessary.
---
We are getting char cars!!!!
---
"New". Its from the video they showed off already. No different than the other  "new" tease posted Tuesday.
---
Well, at least full 15 seconds this time.
---
Charr Dune Roller destruction derby seems like it could be a lot of fun.
---
Good point. It would be awesome to have a clean T-shirt. Or a T-shirt where we can use our custom images.
---
tyvm
---
Had to be a hyper shiny green charr along for the ride
---
Same situation here. Started about 5 days ago. Lot of mmo experience. I actually don't really know why I did not play gw2 beforehand...
---
 I played gw1 and did not 100% enjoyed it, may be that's the reason. Was stuck on a bad "a priori". 
---
So far enjoying the game. Skipping all story things cause... Not my cup of tea. But the gameplay and the variety of activities is fun.
---
I mean, that is literally what the release have been stated to be, what else do you expect them to tease?
---
Wasn't nvidia ANSEL working with Guild wars 2 ? 
---
I personally can't test since I avoid GFE like the plague.
---
Thanks
---
Have you thought about crafting it to precursor only? This is how [Man o' War](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/9/96/Man_o%27_War.jpg) looks like in comparison to [HMS Divinity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/7/79/The_HMS_Divinity.jpg).
---
I feel like it’s nothing to do with story it’s just mini games and it doesn’t look very high quality no tee no shade but girllll they are lost
---
they are the charrcars from wvw, so you can test them if you want already
---
 No wonder "a trailer" comes with the prologue... they have really nothing to show with this prologue just charr bashing this, charr crashing this. All of this followed by a "big announcement".
---
These teasers are worse marketing than no teasers
---
A sad sad thing to do.
---
So the "teaser" is just an extended version of what we already saw.
---
Ahh, thank you! I didn't realise I can just buy bigger bags - duh! For some reason I thought I just need to craft them, which would take forever! Still have to check about those boosters!
---
My PvP scrapper uses another skin from r his hammer since the sharur do not match with it.
---
I'll try in wvw with my rev even if it's just an alarev I am using in fractals

There is no war in Ba Sing Se .

Check this site out.. Might help you. You need to put your API from Arenanet webset in it. It's safe to use API.
---
I got a gem shop gun cause I loved the skin. Never used it but still love it
---
 Sooner or later they will give us a ranger with rifle
---
Gpose allows you to change lightning, camera angle. You can stop specific emotes at a certain time, not only for you but everyone around you - same for skills.
---
Ever wanted to catch a cool show of the elementality Phoenix flying out? Would be easy with Gpose.
---
Even GW1 has new players.
---
The real question is what won't get you banned on their Twitch/Forums?
---
Why do people even try talking to them anymore? Disregarding the timeout, they will never answer these questions.
---
It's one of those shovel ready jobs. You've been selected.
---
Streams aren't the place to give feedback, they stream to have fun with the game.
---
People can't seem to understand that, and keep asking the same questions every stream or shit talking the devs.
---
It's probably a re-use of the charr car from WvW.
---
Ep1 should launch in November. After halloween
---
Are PoF and HoT zones and story supposed to be extremely difficult to solo?
---
I'm playing a Power Berserker, following the build here https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/power/ with slight modifications (couple of more stuns to help with break bars). I have pretty decent gear (full exotic berserker armor and accessories, couple of ascended armor items)
---
Yet I die every few minutes. I feel extremely squishy, and can die multiple times in a single story part, and have a very hard time getting maps completed and generally participating in open world stuff.
---
Am I doing something wrong? Or is this intentional? Would it help if I switched to vitality and toughness on gear, or a different build?
---
Some streamers, cliques, and loyal "fans" are not "masses".
---
As for those players that left for classic, for nostalgia, will be back...once the nostalgia starts fading.
---
The casuals...well...they are casuals for a reason: they jump ships on a constant basis.
---
It’s just disappointing at this point.
---
Thank u very much
---
there are honesty not much bosses with a dps check. largos is kinda tough, but most dont require exorbitant dps if you dont want to speedrun (like adina bursting before she gets reta)
---
Thank you! This just made me buy the DLC's - I love the sound of the Heart of Thorns maps! 
---
I think I will just re-do the locked seasons later (if I stick around for long enough), but the DLC's maps sound really good and the fact that I can get a mount and glider is great! Buying all seasons, feels kind of meh, since it seems that it's DLC's that bring most value (cool maps, mounts, elite specialisations).
---
I think I will go for HoT story line first!
---

there is a dodge on sword #3 and hammer #3 and block on staff #3
---
My PC isn't great, so I would love to play it if they ever made a console port.
---
Works great, thanks. When you load new map things load 1by1 for 10 secs but its a small tradeoff because this makes your fps much better
---
I was trying for a week to get a T4 but noone is bothered generally since a lot of people want the gemstone from just doing the bosses. Then a miracle, an organised T4 run every Friday night at 06:45 uk time and it was done. So if your in the EU, and want the T4, get on tomorrow night at this time and prepare to get your Bladed chest.
---
Domain of Kourna, head to the farm to the west where you find the heart vendor with Debbie's Cakes. Lots of herb nodes there plus some flax. My most recent trip yielded 6 varietal cilantro seeds.
---
Sandswept Isles, head to the cluster of herb nodes on the hill overlooking the main waypoint. On a good day I'll get multiple varietal seeds.
---
Bitterfrost Frontier, there are five herb nodes on the map, three along the western side and another two clustered on the far eastern side. Decent chance at varietal peppercorn seeds.
---
Timberline Falls, while mining platinum and chopping hard wood trees I came across several herb nodes with a chance to drop varietal peppercorn seeds.
---
Lake Doric, while mining for living world currency and killing some Deer on the northern part of the map I came across herb nodes that dropped varietal mint seeds. 
---
Harathi Hinterlands, I noticed a couple herb nodes close to each other in the northwest while searching for the guild bounty Brekkabek. Those nodes should drop varietal mint seeds.

Posted the idea once a couple years ago that the reason they don't focus on fixing WvW was because they get quite a bit of money from all the transfers.

Had no previous infractions but got an insta permanent ban for "Spreading conspiracy theories"

It was, but this strange new item I've never seen should take the trophy now.

I guess that explains why you couldn't die.

Nothing story related, dunno if I should be worried or excited?
---
&gt; 10 is still too much for pat, 3 or 4 would be better to avoid while leaving room for random people that show up. pat is soloable anyway
---
Yup, 3 to 4 is plenty for Pat. I haven't killed him solo, but I have done it quite a few times with a second person showing up. His health isn't the issue, it's bringing down his shield. Solo it just seems to take forever...although that's better than when there's like 20 people there and every egg only takes out a sliver.
---
For me story starts with Heart of Throns
---
Perfection.
---
I like both. What does that make me?
---
My guild has a pretty cheerful fanfare that plays when we complete guild missions. I was fighting Balthazar while some people were doing guild missions, and right as Balthazar dies in an explosion of magic they finished a guild mission and this light and happy fanfare starts playing.
---
It was the most inappropriate music to celebrate the final defeat of an unhinged god of war, and I loved it.
---
It makes me happy that even characters with cerebral palsy get to join in on the celebration!
---
I don't know. Not intentional, that's for sure.
---
I'm just a bit skeptic about those lootables you need. I'm not looking forward to farming pirates until that one particular amulet drops ...
---
I have the funds to level artificer and make the staff, but I rather don't if there's a nicer alternative. I'm still thinking about Bo, but the time investment is steep.
---
I'm only in a two man guild, and my pal hasn't logged in for 4 months :'(
---
Hey there @spikecubed - Its me, the active weird one 😅. Just wanted to add a few things here. I do atleast 3, but mostly 4-5 GW2 Streams per week - GW2 is the only game being covered on my twitch-channel https://www.twitch.tv/krokotasche - and my streams are always both, german and english. Used to be a progressive / semi-progressive WvW - Player, doing GvGs, Scrims etc. Up until today WvW is still my favourite gamemode, but you'll see me doing PvE-Raids from time to time aswell. Im curious to hear where the 'weird' is coming from 😄. Is it because I'm roleplaying as a cat, because of my raps or because of me singing and playing the piano? 🤔😊😅👍
---
Free space on their HDD and SSD's?
---
He even did a vertical one. That's advanced.
---
Precisely .  The NPC animations appear to be superior to ETC, though it has been many years since I saw them in game.
---
Maybe each subsequent trailer will be longer...kind of like a reverse countdown.
---
Fair enough. I also feel somewhat squishier on my Holosmith than in my DH for example
---
actually casual does not mean they switch among games.
---
most casuals do not have enough time to play a single game only.
---
This is great, I think I might take the plunge and buy POF. 
---
Thanks for posting this, I hadn't seen the news that you get HOT free.
---
I'd say you should be less bad at dodging and kiting. But what can I know ;)
---
Downvoted for low effort
---
Does that make you half-brain dead then?
---
Now frost that on a cake and we're good.
---
Because men have danglebits that can fall out of short shorts.  Women don't.
---
Actually, that's EXACTLY what it means...they play CASUALLY...hence... CASUAL. See how that works?
---
Doesn't matter if you want to get hurt by my statement or not, nor does it matter if you want to apply your own definition to it...because it will not change facts.
---
Coming to a gem store near you soon.

I started about 2 months ago. About to buy the expansion. It's a fun game!
---
they never talked publicly about login numbers, why would they comment now?
---
Nah you misunderstand, there isn't any 'right' place where the devs take feedback.. that's why people post stuff on stream. Even in their own forums, the devs hear only what they want to hear.

Chose necromancer because a lot of people recommended it to me because it is easy to learn and survivable. Didn't realise it seems to be a fairly disliked class in endgame pve. Will I run into problems?
---
Do people not just do the zones as they go through? I just 100% each zone when I went there during story missions and it worked pretty well. Can't imagine just blitzing through and having to go back and do ALL the hearts one after another.
---
I typed out ["lol"](https://imgur.com/clOAqSZ) in the cooking 500 stream and got timed out. Anything is possible.
---
Dunno why you got downvoted. It's stupid and flies in the face of Charr society that we know.
---
Why is Anet so adverse to just sticking with their own lore? Charr Rock Band? Really?
---
Oh here we go. “Marketing is the worst!”  
---
You are all such a whiny bunch of b**ches. Seriously. Don’t like it? Leave the game and make room for the new blood who is actually fun to play with.
---
yikes
---
wtf is this shit
---
My school the girls got the same shorts as boys but theyd buy em small and roll the top up, cause reasons.
---
Maybe they could introduce alternate weapon skins this way. Nothing crazy just take an already existing skin and create some color variants. Maybe tie the more "exclusive" skins to events or something. One of my least favorite features in GW2 is that weapon skins can't be recolored.
---
Ok, let me rephrase it for them so you understand what they meant : It's a few different angles on a thing we've already seen in a previous teaser. Oh, and it's night time. This video brought nothing new or exciting to the table.
---
&gt; Doesn't matter if you want to get hurt by my statement
---
He was not hurt, just has a different opinion of what casual means.   What's up with your hurt fixation in your flair and your reply?

Sometimes you want to hide details and that's where Shadow Abyss comes in handy. Permafrost is for when you want to blind people. I use Shadow Abyss on my Ice Encasement and Midnight dyes on the glowing slot. Midnight will dye the armor but will make the glow very weak or even disappear.

---
Sigh, you white knights are completely hopeless.
---
&gt; Can't you just scale the meta for 1 person and have the player do one loop has the story mission.
---
For some metas it would require a lot of work and for some it would be impossible without changing the whole fight.
---
The marionette and the battle of lion arch for example required players to do different stuff at the same time. Downscaling wouldn't help.
---
&gt; And why recreate maps? Those maps already exists they were used back in season 1, just need to make them instanced.
---
They actually don't. Not even a map of the old LA exist anymore. When they changed maps in LS1, they *changed* the map, the didn't replace them and saved the old one. Also at some time after LS1 they made an update that deleted many unnecessary and unneeded datas.
---
Almost like ETC has been a thing for a decade and this is supposed to come out next week.
---
People are just shitposting at this point
---
With some people, yes. Some people are kind of anal about playing the meta, to the point of exclusivity. Others don't care at all as long as you're contributing and not dragging everyone down. Most people tend to fall somewhere within the middle of that spectrum; they can appreciate a meta build played well, but aren't going to strictly enforce it.
---
Necromancer isn't bad, it's just not absolutely amazing in endgame PvE.
---
People spam it mindlessly all the times, so there is no surprise they blacklisted it.
---
It's guitar riffing giant cat beasts with crazy hair and a stage presence. Nothing emo about that, but one can twist everything to shit, I suppose.
---
around 60-70% of my guild just quit after the stream. We all hoped we would get a big content drop, instead we got pretty much nothing. Glorified dragon bash arena, a world boss that gives no rewards after you are done with the achievements and again an episode you log in for 2 days, complete the grind and be done with it.
---
It reminded of Shards of War, so perhaps another relic from the times of the searing.
---
For people like me who don't fully understand the basics of the market could be useful to use simple terms and many examples. I tried in the past but it is like a work and I didnt really get the theory behind finding good markets
---
How is this against the lore? Is there lore stating Charr never celebrate or make music? That they never ever have fun? What?
---
When the Starborn Outfit was released and being talked about, people compared the crotch plate to a diaper. It looks nothing like a diaper either.
---
Actually, y'all got it right at least once. The Wedding Outfit on male charr *does* look like a diaper. But that was like 4 years ago that people drew that comparison.
---
Because it is important to.
---

&gt;Leave the game and make room for the new blood

Except that there isn't any new blood coming. It's just people leaving and the game dying. [Look at this chart of their earnings, it's obvious that between expansions that few people are buying the game or spending any money on the Gem Store.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cz9mob/i_was_interested_in_guild_wars_2s_earnings_since/?st=k0h0kvpc&amp;sh=82f27cfe)
---
It's more like an autism epidemy.
---
I'm shocked they didn't answer your bad faith complaint pretending to be a question.

I think you convinced me! Lvling the masteries will probably take the most time, but I'm running around in Maguuma for now anyways!

What makes Condi Chronos safer than scepter miraged?
---
Right?  this literally was updated 4 years ago with HoT...
---
The only time I remember it being done was when WoW was at it's peak or when a game just launched and they try to justify why the servers collapse under the strain.
---
It's like an industry golden rule not to talk about in-game populations. Literally nothing to gain from doing it unless you are a monster like WoW used to be, and so much to lose by doing it.
---
There was nothing for ArenaNet or the community to gain by engaging with this comment, the people asking it know that.
---
Wow, what a grind. Congrats on the kill, and more importantly, congrats on maintaining enough sanity to share your accomplishment. A part of me is really happy to see the Condi Chronos succeed where the Mirages failed. The words "added safety" are especially appealing.
---
So make the r/guildwars2 be about just criticism of Guild Wars 2 and drive people interested in it away? Because judging by how this post has been buried, you'll be happy to know that that is just what the mods are helping you make it. So have fun.
---
Next patch is Tuesday, so I'd wait until then.
---
Also, if you have a nice mouse, try turning down the polling rate as that has affected framerate in the past.
---
You are really overthinking this.
---
[There is...](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d35mbn/am_i_the_only_one_seeing_more_players_start_gw2/) ;)
---
I'd also be nice if we could buy a t-shirt outfit with the guild emblem. Something like 100--200 guild tokens and 50 gold should be reasonable.
---
Yeah, it should probably be something simpler, like "Waster Potential Wars 2".
---
If you don't like it, just leave.
---
Bit bored now I've hit the time gate, but it is fun tbf, introduced me to a lot of fun bits throughout the maps I didn't know existed etc.
---
r/guildwars2
---
Literally downvoting content teased by the developers out of sight, and any positive comment regarding it within the thread.
---
Nah, it's the new mobile Guild Wars 2 battle royale game coming soon™.
---
Add unique skins to each and every of their shops, I've started talking to every Karma Vendor and finding skins I didn't own and merchants as well, that'd be pretty cool tbh
---
I would watch that. I think you should start covering the basic stuff ( like daily crafts ) and then hinting the argument of the next video ( like "next, we'll talk about exclusive skins as a market", anticipating BL weaps skins investments ).
---
&gt; erect 
---
heh
---
As far as I understand it has to do with what are we actually seeing when looking at things like mounts or armor pieces. It seems that "mounts" are not entities themselves, but rather a persistent animation on your character. While armor pieces are entities that interact with your character, and as such, capes would "clip" with the different animations the character does, specially on models like charr.  
---
It is an excuse, it's certainly something that can be solved, the problem is most likely that ANet doesn't see solving it as a profitable use of their resources. As it would require modifications on the engine, that from what they've said, they don't feel too comfortable modifying due to the possible implications and bugs that would cause on other aspects of the game.
---
A proper roadmap would do a lot, if followed and explained properly. But you know, ANet doesn't care about programming ahead of the next gemstore release.
---
It will fail.
---
It's going to be like an appetiser before the real Living World starts. We'll get a few fun mini-games and a bit of lead-in story, but I wouldn't expect too much out of a prologue. I suspect they'll eventually convert the prologue's mini-games into a charr-themed annual event to fill content gaps.
---
Add the [command line arugment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments#-bmp) -bmp and it will do that!
---
&gt;GW2 is famous for it's pvp system
---
Like i know you say you're new. But that is meme levels of comment right there.
---
Ok, let me rephrase it for them so you can understand what they meant: It's not even the same event or even the same area within the new map.
---
By asking a question that takes all of 5 seconds to answer? And I think you might be high if you think ppt’ers give a shit about the game mode and are not just there to get the gift of battle
---
They all share a the same vendor tabs, so we can't give each vendor some random unique item you can buy from them without making a change in the vendor tabs to have that variation. Anything you put in any of their tabs will be given to all of them.  
---
There's 16 different tabs in intervals of 5 levels from level 5.  
---
They sometimes scale to player level (like the PvP vendors), and other times they scale to the level of the area.  There's currently no way to know which one will be until you check the vendor.   
---
They are only really valuable for level 5 and 10 characters to get helmet and shoulders early as they are not available crafted until level 10 and 20.
---
One possible change that could be done to give them an use is giving them gear gambling like Wirt/Gheed/Kadala in the diablo series:
---
* They would have a third tab with gear at the player's level range that is 10 times more expensive, but when purchased has a chance to be better than basic.  
---
* The lower the level, the harder for them to produce rarer gear.  On average, the gear bought would be mostly basic up to level 10, fine up to level 30, masterwork up to level 50, and rare over 50.  
---
* They would also be the only way to get level &lt;18 exotic gear, but you'd have to be very lucky for it.  
---
* A new 'Lucky charm dealer' vendor type could also be added across the game, selling Basic trinkets and offering trinket gambling. Worry not, they would not be obsessed about breakfast cereals. 
---
* All gear obtained from them would also be account-bound instead soulbound. They would not be usable in the mystic forge, and when salvaged they will produce 2, 9 and 16 copper junk based on level instead materials. 
---
* They could also have a chance to produce all sorts of gear, including mystic forge weapons, champion bag drops, bloodbound weapons, ascended and even precursors, but it would be extremely rare even at level 80. 
---
 * These extremely rare jackpots would be salvageable as usual like the exotic gear from login rewards, but they would also be account-bound, so this would be gambling to use only, gambling to sell would have to remain in the mystic forge. 
---
They could also bring back gear Customization from GW1.  
---
* Gear would no longer be Soulbound by default anymore. Any gear that is now soulbound when purchased or equipped will remain account bound.   
---
* You would be able to visit these vendors to Soulbind your gear. Binding a piece of gear could take something like &lt;Gear level&gt;/10 + &lt;rarity value&gt;*2 spirit shards, and a minimum of 1. 
---
 * So binding a level 80 exotic would take 80*10 + 6 * 2= 8 + 12 = 20 spirit shards.
---
 * And a level 1 basic would take 1/10 + 1 * 1 = 0.1 +1 ≈ 1 spirit shard. 
---
* Soulbinding would increase the stats of the item by 5% (Average stat increase per rarity like fine-&gt;masterwork is 10%).
---
* Ascended and legendary gear would not be usable for this.
---
What am I supposed to be looking at?

Its a Build i use for wvw roaming Just switch scepter for staff.. But yeah People think clases are  Just too stiff... Those die first
---
Ah, the good ol' "I can't come up with a proper rebuttal so I'll call you meaningless names to try to act like I'm superior" reply.
---
this is for fresh install, normally if nothing eating performance on your system, things should load in less then 1-2 seconds.
---
&gt;vannilaa 
---
That has to be intentional. But why?
---
They've got overzealous moderators that will not stop to think about context.
---
Mindless praise
---
Offending would be something more like insulting them for no good reason, this was asking a legit question about a serious issue wvw is facing
---
Na, it's the new talking point for a shittily moderated subreddit.

No, see, if you don't look at what's actually happening in the world then it doesn't exist! /s

This isn't an episode, it's the prologue. It's not meant to be heavy story, but it will definitely have some.
---
You sound fun to play with.
---
Really scrapin' the bottom of the barrel for pointless criticism now, huh?
---
As someone who has dabbled with the TP and playing the market, but not been able to make more than a lucky buck now and then, this would be greatly appreciated.
---
Not sure how much interest you'd need before you make the decision to start but it's probably something that many would really enjoy and get real value out of for this game.
---
lol I like you. Couldn't be more spot on.
---
The text is not centred.
---
It's not worth watching anyway
---
Nah, I don't usually do map comp on my way through a map; only the occasional event (which usually nets a bit of progress on a heart) and pois that I happen upon. The only thing I go out of my way for are waypoints.
---
Please.
---
I suspect it's and item meant to replace champion tokens from the last champion rush. So people don't hoard them before the next rush. 
---
I'd I'm right, then any player that logins with a character that had those tokens, or having those tokens in the bank or shared inventory will trigger a script that removes the token and gives the junk trophy.  
---
If you participated in the Champion Rush, check any character that may have had a champion token. If you can't find any but find this trophy instead, that could be it.
---
Hi, is there a way to keybind consumables, such as cc consumables for fractals? 
---
Thank you
---
That was probably intentional.
---
As a veteran who has monitored the state of the sub for the past few weeks, I am confident that this is exactly what will happen.
---
No devs going to give you a responce to such question.... are yall serious here?  People have been saying the player base is quitting and leaving en mass since the game launched.
---
I wouldnt have timed you out but you would definitly be ignored.  I mean what proof does he have of this "situation"?
---
Why the fuck wouldn't you get upset about someone wasting your time?
---
The Asura looks like she has a swarm of flies. The stinky Asura with no awards. :P

Gj only reading the first half of my post bud

Censoring forums, censoring twitch... I'm surprised ANet hasn't announced they've made deal with Epic Games at this point.
---
I just picked a number, I don't remember what 480p exactly looks anymore. It's 2019 after all.
---
Is that a "yes" to my question?
---
I don't expect anything anymore.
---
Nope!
---
Bro I'll join your guild
---
&gt; If you reveal too much, you might find that you yourself lose out on some profits.
---
...and death threats from people, whose markets and techniques you've revealed. Look at posts on this sub, where someone reveals a JP skip, profitable farming spot, or even a kiting spots in PvP.
---
I got banned fr 9 min for saying NA servers

Theirs very few times where you can insult someone for good reason so no, but if you read my post you’d see that I said I didn’t think he was insulting them
---
No, it's just a screenshot of the search function. Better check a thread fully before answering in the future
---
Yes and no. While they often reuse assets from before for the updates we need to acknowledge that they used mainly PoF assets for LS4 which were new and therefore look really good. Here however we can see that they went all-in on the 2012 asset copy and past spree which lets the map look really old although it's new. So there's that and based on the teasers it does look lazy and old so far. 
---
Despite that youre somewhat wrong with your "every single MMO does exactly the same thing". ESO, as well as WoW and FFXIV, reuse older assets however by far not as many as Anet does in Gw. And by far I mean by far.
---
Necro is a very safe class because of the shroud and the pets so it's very possible to get to 80 almost by accident by just running at everything and letting your pets deal with it while having a huge amount of health. This playstyle won't really help you at end game and is a liability when playing with other people. 
---
Necro can be pretty powerful and definitely has a place at the end game, but you have to turn the safety off to do it. Experiment with different skills - if you can survive without all your pets out and your shroud up, you're probably doing pretty well.
---
&gt; So make the r/guildwars2 be about just criticism of Guild Wars 2
---
HOW DARE YOU CRITIZISE A GAME THAT YOU LOVE!!!!11111!!. 
---
*If you don't blindly follow Anet and under no circumstance critizise them when they fuck up, then you are not a real fan.* 
---
This is you and anyone who isn't a complete dickriding moron should be embarrassed by this. Wether you agree or disagree about the direction this game is taking, telling people to leave and cease communicating their grievances is idiotic. You are contributing nothing, neither for the people that love the direction, nor for the people that hate it. Critizism about a product is extremely valuable for a company and anyone that tries and shuts down this critizism is stupid. If you can't handle, that a substantial amount of users on this subreddit don't like the current direction, then leave this subreddit and join a community that better reflects your opinion and prefferences, but stop shouting people down that love the game just as much as you.

I would like them to be some sort of pseudo-Trading post for weapons and armor only. It finds the recommended gear and you can buy the gear straight from the TP.
---
&gt; but if you read my post you’d see that I said I didn’t think he was insulting them
---
I did and I saw. 
---
&gt; Theirs very few times where you can insult someone for good reason so no
---
That's actually a "yes" to my question... 
---
There is *never* a reason to insult anyone, that're basics of ethic.
---
You... you meant that the other way around, right?
---
New to the game? 
---
Make sure you post the picture you took with  your phone of all the people in the human starting area and how Shadow Behemoth was some of the most fun you've had in an mmo in a long time and how friendly all the people you've met in game have been.
---
I would love to see this
---
y'know there is a middle ground.  I've played with both types of commanders: the one who doesn't even bother to collect nodes before running to the next objective, map dodging enemy zergs, and I've played with the other type who intentionally gets marked to draw attention, and might farm bags in the lords room in enemy garry for 30mins straight without even trying to take down the lord.
---
But between that are the rest of us: players who like to get the rewards/XP from flipping objectives, but also enjoy fighting the defenders, or just groups forming out in the field.  We don't avoid marked to run from fights, only to keep our position tactictally hidden so our commander can best choose the ground (which is always the high ground!) for the battle, or to give us time to get our siege up before counter fire rains down.
---
I frustrates me that so many in the community seem to think you are either in it just to fight players 24/7, or you only want to PvD and flip empty objectives all day long.
---
It takes a narrow mind to see the world only in absolutes.
---
I wish it was more over-the-top. In fact, I wish all boons had cool visual effects.
---
Nice to see they still don't give a shit about wvw 4 years later.
---

---
u/ANetHoGM Is there a point to all this? Because it looks embarrassing on this end.
---
Seems fairly likely, although the colour scheme and general aesthetic give me the impression that it could be something related to Aurene.
---
They can't even be tone deaf when they're not even bothering to listen at this point.
---
Hey devs I love guild war- (timed out)
---
Agreed.
---
The idea that these guys aren't on the clock is a bit mindboggling.. Does Karl really look like he plays the game a lot in his free time? Have you seen Karl play DH?
---
It is kind of funny honestly. Makes me think of those dystopian settings where if you step out of line at all then you are on the chopping block :p Just smile and be positive and they won't come for you.
---
Apology accepted, I guess? I'm very frustrated by this but also genuinely curious what the rationale is for this. The trickling out of "teasers" that don't seem to show anything really new. Meanwhile we'll get a trailer for the prologue... when the prologue comes out?
---
Having taken about a 2 year break from gw2 I logged in last week and got that outfit. How do I remove the outfit. It replaced all my hard earned skin items lol
---
Yes, no one has ever had fun playing gw2
---
Turned you into Lara Croft
---
I mean... You are not wrong, story is pretty bland. I made the char named Boring Story for this exact reason. 🤣
---
Could it be that you were timed out before then for 600 seconds and when you typed lol it just reminded you how much time was left?
---
&gt; he is the biggest white knight this sub has probably but you completely failed at making good arguments.
---
Sure you are.
---
Not apologizing but always glad to hear constructive feedback. :-)
---
This is the way marketing has chosen to move forward for this release. Trying a new rollout. It will either work or not work, with learnings either way.
---
Praise Anet
---
No exclamation mark at the end? That's a 3 day ban for low energy.
---
Huh? Are you trying to imply that a WvW Commander can only be good if he's in a dedicated WvW guild? That elitist and asinine.
---
Thanks for advice, tried my first PVP today. That was hilarious! Glorious victory against people that seems to be as experienced in GW as me xD
---
You realize you just quoted them doing exactly the thing you're describing with the comment above theirs, right?
---
This i agree on would be really nice if they come to youtube because there are alot of pixles on my screen watching this so i can not fully enjoy it. So if possible please add them to youtube too :)

imagine how freaking op stacking alacrity and quickness would be. holy shit
---
Bad faith complaint? OP WANTS to keep playing the game and he’s frustrated that the game mode that has kept him in the game is dying/dead.
---
I’ll see what I can do :-)
---
Obviously it would have to be rescaled.
---
Imagine how OP burning, bleeding and confusion would be if they had the same damage per stack as before they were converted to stacking.
---
I got warned for saying the reason they're nerfing the hot classes so much is because they want people to buy POF and got the same conspiracy theory.
---
I couldn't get personalized license plates for my Tacoma truck with the word "taco" in it for the same reason. It's not just Arenanet, welcome to the world we live in nowadays. Lame!
---
They know. They don't plan to fix it/change it/improve it, which is evidenced by years of inaction in wvw. (Alliance soon, TM). Its the Players who simply refuses to acknowledge. I want YOU now to acknowledge that you are aware of it.. Anet will never come out and state "we stopped wvw development".  If that's what you were expecting, you are living in a bubble. Anet will continue enjoying whatever little population there is left. It doesn't cost them anything other than some outrage posts in reddit once a month.
---
You really think they don't know wvw population is shrinking? They fucking know. To them it's not a problem worth putting resources into, for good or bad. As customers, it's for players to take it, or leave it. I have reduced my play time. I stopped spending. And I am a stupid dumb pve casual with occasional wvw.
---
All I’m getting from this post is that I should give up on ANet and shouldn’t bother people who are complacent to their development strategy.
---
To be perfectly honest, I only log on to this game if my guild wants to WvW or maybe PvE raid if I’m feeling up for it. But WvW has been stale for god knows how long and we haven’t ran a fun WvW raid in a very long time. 
---
I’m bitter because I got a taste of the good days of WvW. The combat system for this game is one of a kind. It’s fun and rewarding group play back then. If ANet had put just a little bit of effort into WvW, they’d have made loyal customers of me, my guild, and many like minded people.
---
These are people who pay gems to transfer to servers. Some of us pay gems to buy their silly little outfits. Some pay gems to get gold because the gold rewards for WvW is laughable, and we rather spend time in WvW having fun than grind in PvE so we rather pay to skip the grind to get the gear we need.
---
I’ve accepted a long time ago that ANet doesn’t care. At the end of the day, I WANT them to. While I have many complaints about this game,  I STILL want to play it. There’s no good alternative to it. You can tell me to fk off and find a better game but I can’t because there is no game for me and my guild that can satisfy us as WvW did.
---
I don't disagree with you, but they take it a step further.  Simply being ignored is one thing, actively being censored for seemingly arbitrary reasons is another.
---
*looks sadly at aura rework*
---
The divines smile upon me, imperial, can you say the same?
---
If rock = emo music then rap = good music.
---
&gt; The game doesn't run on those.
---
The thing you don't realize is it really does run on those.  Guilds create content for other players.  The more guilds that quit, there less there is to do for everyone.  You like PPT as you mentioned before, I'm sure you also found it fun trying to defend against a guild trying to take your keep?  
---
It takes a group to take initiative, actually leave their territory and attack something for most "action" to start.  The fewer groups willing to do this, the less action there is.
---
Again, not even comparable.
---

---
&gt; They've got overzealous moderators that will not stop to think ~~about context.~~
---
Fixed that for you.
---
*Literally shaking*
---
It is absolutely the fault of the casuals though. They hijacked the GW2 community and influenced developer sensibilities.
---
Ironically, it is the devs who pandered to the casuals, creating an endless feedback loop.
---
Due to neglect and recent lack of news regarding WvW improvements a lot more players and guilds have left the game recently.
---
ANET promoted their forum mods Kappa.
---
Joking aside, I'm inclined to believe the comments by former devs calling ANET management troubled. Their moderation policy absolutely comes from the upper management.
---
I'm sure you have checked and come to realize I'm none of those things.
---
You must be new here. People downvote patch notes since forever.
---
Something only support can help you with.
---
Thanks for playing.
---
Yes, even though it is 2019. Space is still finite.
---
IMO the issue isn't not answering the question but timing him out for asking it.
---
Colloquially, "dev" is just used to refer to anyone who works on the game, not specifically programmers.
---
While yes, updating Windows 10 can fuck you over, Windows 7 and Windows XP had to deal with the same issue. Sometimes it's a weird combination of updates/software interacting in weird/non-favorable ways as well. Saying that it never happened with XP and 7 and everything was always safe is just plain wrong
---
I'm not sure this can be considered censorship in the same way:  
---
1. It's their twitch channel. If they want the topic to stay on the videos topic, that's their prerogative.
---
2. It keeps the chat clean so that viewers in there to talk about what the video is about aren't buried by others barraging the streamer with questions, anger, etc.
---
3. The issues that players ask about are quite well known, so I highly doubt they're trying to censor/ignore those users so much as just keep to what I was talking about in #1 and #2.
---
I agree with you mate. And I share the pain. I have never played another game for more than 3 months in my life. I have short attention span. And here I am.. Still here after years. So I really know what you mean. And I am not telling you to leave the game. Its not my place to tell that. I am only pointing out that Anet will not respond to the specific point you are raising. That problem you/we need to be self aware of. That's all. Anet has closed themselves for "open feedbacks" like AMA or Q&amp;A. (but again, the dev stream is not a place to ask this. So I don't agree with OP either) 
---
You see this "who is ur fav quaggan" quotes very often. The reason the dev can answer that, bcoz that's a personal question. Dev has the freedom to answer that.. You ask me which is my company's fav product, I tell you in a blink.. Pester me for my company's product roadmap in 2020 , I will be silent and probably stop talking to you. That's the difference here.
---
Sorry if I got carried away. It was more of a rant and was not personal. Apologies.
---
I'm still triggered they removed the female human idle animation because a post like this :(.
---
Where is the offensive comment?
---
Here's a helpful visual aid

their stream is extremely censorship
---
If we're going with aa bb naming (Bound by Blood) for episode releases, maybe the next one will be called Charrs with Cellos.
---
Probably more than a few years ago, honestly, now that so much is stored in the cloud. I doubt it's a concern for most desktop users, but for mobile devices, it can be.
---
&gt; Don’t like it? Leave the game
---
[Good thing you are not writing this on the forums](https://imgur.com/a/pZuizob) (check out the title of the post at the bottom)
---
They're running low on resources, and this is all we get. Which don't get me wrong, it's cool, but far from what should be the priority now.
---
I don't even know why we're getting another stupid festival instead of some serious story. Why does everything have to be fucking joke?
---
Ah OK - was just wondering if anyone had experienced the same thing and knew why it was showing invalid despite it being valid in reality.
---
How is that question trying to instigate anything?
---
This makes it MORE playable.
---
More that the devs catered to their audience, rather than a delusional minority that seem to think a game with the mechanical depth of a puddle could ever be hardcore.
---
Dude, Windows 10 Update bricked my friend's computer and he had to completely reformat and re-setup software. And since he's a digital artist, his career is on the line whenever these things happen.

You speak about simple code monkeys tho. Those can be completely cluess people or even pakistanian outsourcers. And I don't really think they show up on streams anyway. A-net still has 250+ employees - no one knows or cares about most of  these. 
---
Who does show up are all kinds of designers and team leads, and they should have an idea of how things are (going to be) working in game in general. It seems that in a-net it is these people who are supposed to talk to community directly about the game (not about  prde parades and favourite quaggans), and they don't really do that a lot.
---
Good luck getting the subreddit logo changed to "Wasted Potential Wars 2".
---
you dont speak for me, I find taking keeps, towers and castles rewarding with small groups. sorry to hear that you dont enjoy it but there are those of us who do enjoy making an impact with a small unit.

No, that was because he was playing necro.

Thank you, much appreciated.

Is weaver really hard to learn? I just boosted an elementalist up to 60 and finished leveling to 80. I dont know if I want to go with a weaver or tempest. Weaver honestly looks amazing, but im afraid I will go that route and be completely overwhelemed.

I also have no idea what Tempest is all about, other than using warhorns which seems "meh" to me.

It's because "EZ" on better twitch TV in some channels turns into a Pepe with sunglasses, and ArenaNet believes Pepes are nazi propaganda.
---
Act like Peachy and you won't have any problems in the Twitch chat or any other Anet media channel ever.
---
Just think, all your effort at shitposting and creating alt accounts will finally be rewarded! Maybe this one can go past 17 days.

And when i updated, absolutely nothing bad happened.

The hardest part is wanting to do things that require gold but doing things that make gold are so boring.

Wouldn't it be cool if the Charr Bikes become a mount? Been wanting one for years. And thought for sure we'd get charr bikes when they released rollerbeetles...
---
I'm sorry for making you confused. Thank you for your message.
---
ah maybe, but it definitely wasn't my norn that said it.... it wasn't said as like part of a story or anything it was one of those dialogues you'd find by just staying in one place long enough to hear the npcs talk to each other.
---
We could all start saying "Anet employee who works on the game or promotes it."
---
I play the game off and on, I bought it. I can play it how I wish.
---
Also helps in hiding Vale Guardian teleports!
---
We only know one just one side of the story.
---
I find OP rather suspicious. He seems to delete a lot of his comments/topics. Just check his comment/topic karma and his recents comments. It doesn't add up.
---
Of course he might be right in this one but there is still confusion around this.
---
Usually, my first inclination would be to agree with you on the "ignoring them" part of it, but if you've ever seen a Twitch chat channel (and you've probably seen more than I have), you know that trolls/spammers/angry gamers can take over the chat really fast making it difficult for anyone to read what's being said. 
---
It's also ANet/streamer's responsibility to ensure that their viewers get what they came to that video for and so deleting comments that are off topic is definitely in-line with creating a better experience for the swath of users NOT there to ask other questions.
---
I don’t use shoulders, traditional helmets (I’ll use horns or w/e), or back pieces because they all look so wonky to me when my character moves. I still spend hours on outfits.

That last line was the guy who raids.

The RX 580 and Ryzen5 2600 are a good match. Just don't forget to budget for any other parts of the PC you might need to buy.

Dumb thing ? everything was fine no ? xD :( LUL

Some people hate anything on this sub that isn't negativity/complaining

i hope the full trailer isnt in that cabinet at least

W5, since W5 has Dhuum.
---
That's what any market will do. The point I am trying to teach is how to take advantage of those margins while they exist. Every guide I see tends to gravitate towards a certain item without explaining why that item was chosen. I want to teach how to find that item consistently, regardless of what it is at the time.
---
to bad arenanet doesn't have much going on for marketing or community department, besides cringe mediocre merchandise or meaningless fluff / drawings of your character of course...
---
Dark Souls for fashion. Seriously, I cri every time I see Dark Souls' armors/weapons and compare these to GW2's counterparts. I'd pay 2000 gems to wear even standard Knight Set from DS3. This game lacks simple yet good looking armors.
---
And helmets for the love of God. Simple closed helmets.
---
If you're struggling with core ele, weaver will definitely be a pain. It's definitely the hardest elite spec to learn, but it also depends how quick you learn and how good you currently are.
---
Tempest is easier considering that overload mechanic is quite slow so you cant mess up that much, but you're still fairly squishy and all of them are in melee-mid range. Generally for pve purposes, non warhorn tempest builds are rather weak considering that staff got nerfed and sc/wh has huge burst output from range and is one of the best open world builds on ele.
---
Check metabattle for some builds and tips.

this town certainly has changed.... and not at all for the better

Equating rude internet comments with domestic violence...

Rude comments == Domestic violence
---
Mate... Leave the internet and go out into the real world, you sheltered, naive child
---
well gee sorry someone pissed in your cornflakes bud but it appears you are projecting a whole of nonsense onto me over nothing. All I did was point out that the fellow you are ranting about included GW2 in his statement.
---
I'm wondering what other MMO players would say.
---
maybe not the devs them self should talk to us but we dont get anything from the upper management or community manager either...
---
I’m the chip.
---
The Saul d'Alessio arc is one of the best Anet has ever pulled off, including both games
---
I suppose what I was getting at is there are few items that it is worth paying for the convenience of not crafting it or buy ordering it yourself. 
---
So inherently any profit made on the trading post is someone buying the convenience from you. Either you bought and held a inventory or you waited for a buy order and flipped it to some else who didn’t want to wait.
---
From what I have seen of core ele, i find it really easy. I know exactly what abilities to use on what element before switching. I can quickly kill stuf by switching from fire to air. But I havent played any harder content with the class yet. I think I will just go with weaver and if stick with solo pve if I suck lol. Thanks for your response! :)
---
Not talking about enjoyment, I'm talking about it being rewarding. Its not rewarding in a literal sense and given how easy it is with no resistance I don't see how it can feel rewarding psychologically unless you are new. As for tipping the battle well if you think ppting means anything with the current state of the mode well all I can say is that current WvW is definitely for players like you.
---
This is a driving force in a market, everything has a time cost. Everyone values time differently. This is exactly how you make large amounts of gold on the trading post, you convert time to currency. I make more on the TP than I do farming, but I still hear people who say it is impossible to do for one reason or another. My findings are more along the lines of I would make far more money if more people knew how to use a market properly. Volume makes money.
---
It's called "exaggeration". It's an aide that allows you to establish similarities. Sort of like what you hypocritically have no problem doing.
---
Abuse doesn't need to be physical. No, it's not the same as domestic violence, except for the extreme similarities on what the core of the argument is founded on. Your relation with ArenaNet is an abusive one. Just recognize it.
---
I know maybe like 4 of these guilds. I quit playing a year ago or so but case in point MANY guilds have quit. A few take their places but all of us try hards have quit and if new tryhards show up I doubt they'll last long, the game mode gets no love.
---
This might not interest you really that much, but i got it now for 1€ in Saturn (a german electronics store).
---
Nice to see the whole raid community come together for a kill!.
---
JK, congrats guys, nice kill!
---
Name and flair checks out. Nice.
---
that would also be acceptable.
---
Core game is quite easy so even if you mess up, mobs still die with 2 random skills in glass cannon gear. Expansion maps, especially HoT is where it can get messy. You cant know until you try, just make sure that you ddont slot in weaver before you unlock the main dps traits because it's rather meh without them.
---
And you're allowed to.
---
Completing a map, you just have the chance to get a key but not granted. Guess you have to much lucky.
---
GOD.
---
I'll take Warframe's overzealous word filter any time if it means regular content and balance updates, and devs interacting with players, instead of shunning them and acting more like corporate soulless husks instead of gamers.
---
If you would put words into action and stop supporting the  centralisation of power to Silicon Valley, by using an open source, free of bloatware operating system like Linux this would be a NON ISSUE.
---
I was just trolling, my point is PoEs content isntanywhere near expansion level content.
---
Nothing since this whole thing began because he linked the birthday present and other MMOs don't really have that.

Check out [this recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d2caqa/need_some_help_upgrading_my_rig_for_gw2/).

If you can save the extra $60 for a 3600 it would be a much better upgrade.
---
Also be sure to budget for a new motherboard, as Intel and AMD CPUs require different sockets.

Nice!

It is known to bug.  It will appear once upon the creation of an instance and then not respawn.  
---
If you need it for a collection or for ap, the best time to try for it is around reset or on patch day.

Why is windows consistently a piece of shit?

Whats that purple aura? Mallyx revenant?
---
Imagine getting barrier AND alacrity effect on renegade while spamming kalla spirits. Its awfully ugly.

Please stop tee hee please guys come on now stop already hee hee thank you but please stopppp but keep going
---
The game has plenty of players. If your referencing posts about the game dieing, its mostly the long standing veteran players that are upset with end game content releases and balance. 
---
The game as a whole is still an amazing and has a ton of content to which most of the recent complaints are irrelevant.
---
Not only that they make the world feel more populated/interactive, you also can sell all your stuff there. They aren't useless at all.

It's hard to say. Wing 1 has some of the best bosses (Sabetha is still a real treat) but has tedious pre-events. Wing 2 has two genuinely difficult and fun bosses but a boring and frustrating trash mob fight. Wing 3 has a cool theme and decent end boss but a plethora of bugs and escort. Wing 4 has some great story telling and neat designs but some trivial bosses and a cheesy, frustrating final boss. Wing 5's primary saving grace is Dhuum, because the rest of the wing is a cheesy RNG fest. Wing 6 is gorgeous and has fun fights, but has long roleplay sections between bosses. Wing 7's Adina and Sabir are excellent bosses (the former especially), but the final boss is not fun in my opinion and the wing in general is undertuned.
---
I think all things considered, wing 6 is my favorite, followed closely by wing 7 and wing 1.
---
there is other places to do that. talking about windows 10 exclusively (or any OS in general) is not under the subject of the game.
