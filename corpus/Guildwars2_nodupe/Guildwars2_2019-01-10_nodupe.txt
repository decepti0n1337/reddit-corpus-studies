Once this is active, you cannot enter vaults. So it is impossible to rush it just right before reset, for example.

---
---
Oh man that sounds phenomenal. I wish i had a way to test out these runes.
---
PMed. 
---
Sometimes Sloth makes me want to ragequit :-P
---
Maw becomes immune below 8% of health. A single crystal thrown will kill it, but if everyone dies no crystal is thrown, hence boss doesn't die.
---
Yes! Tougher mounts are PARTICULARLY needed in PoF I think.  
---
Minionmancer for best class 2019. Hope to see you around sometime in the auodrome again!
---
It's epic by Living World standards.
---

---
Totally upstaged Kourna's little skirmish.
---
But it will never beat HoT's entire Dragon Stand meta.
---
The final confrontation with Mordremoth in his mind and the battle with the Mouth on the physical level, with all the regrouped Pact members and allied races still feels way more epic.
---
The mind battle may be pretty simple in terms of planning but the Mouth meta is definitely well planned and executed.
---
Larnthir's commands during the final boss phase also helps bring out the feeling of a coordinated attack and I keep playing DS meta for that one reason.
---
If only people can coordinate and CC on third bite .-.
---
&gt; Two weapon sets, two hidden weapons, a ton of weapon-specific tasks and collections for those weaponsets
---
Which is pointless if you're not interested in those though. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the time and care that went behind these weapon sets, but we're already drowning in weapon skins, unlike armor sets (which felt like a better selling point but that's a matter of taste I guess).
---
But fair enough.
---
&gt; 2 meta events,
---
Already mentioned these. They play once every hour, last 15 min max and there's hardly anything to do in-between. 
---
&gt; a LOT of little secrets, amazing verticality etc.
---
Unless you have a griffon (and I do), the verticality doesn't do much. It's a nice change of pace compared to previous map, granted, but it's just that: a map design. Gameplay wise this verticality is hardly used: there is no event to rush us into the voids to collect flying elements, there is no griffon race, there is no leyline for the gliders. Just. Void.
---
&gt; especially when you look at your comparison with Jahai.
---
I really don't know if I'm being biased though, because Jahai definitely feels more alive with its tornadoes, its rift, its constant flow of events. Surely I'm not the only one who feels something is missing with the new release?
---
One of my favorite little voice lines in this episode I stumbled across while playing through a second time with a friend last night. In the camp, there's a Vigil soldier writing a letter to her daughter back home, reading it as she goes.
---
A few times she pauses to rewrite a line because, "What if I die? If I say it like that, she'll think it's her fault..."
---
She ends by just telling her to be good to her uncle, say her prayers, and that she loves her always.
---
Something about this simple little monologue hit me really hard with the weight of the episode, and made me want to go through the chapter yet again, just to see if maybe I can find that character somewhere in the final battle, to know if she'll be able to go home to her daughter someday.
---
You bet! Although it won’t be a carry lol
---
I hate to be a misery, but I found the QC quite bad on this episode. On multiple occasions I had to log in and out because where I stood became covered with rocks. I wouldn't mind so much if I was trying to break out and got stuck, but this was just playing the story; not to mention mounts which also landed me in sticky spots, despite their being no good reason why (e.g., in the final fight, if you try to fly down, there's an invisible wall above which can trap you). Likewise the camera changes broke on multiple occasions so I missed Kralk entering the Auditorium. Disappointing really when the story was OK. 
---
That's so nice of you, thanks :)
---
I'm not saying this goes for everyone, but a some people already got all the raid/fractal achievements, did all the achievements in open world that they wanted to do, and have no interest in pvp. Raids and fractals don't stay interesting for over 2 years after initial release, and with current balance aren't even fun to begin with
---
I was shocked to scroll through the story achievement screen and see only one achievement with an award: the meta achievement giving the Corsair legs. Not even volatile magic or a mini for any other achievement. It makes the achievements feel barren and meaningless.
---
Also, the heart vendors don’t sell anything but map currency and minis. As someone who doesn’t care about minis, there’s basically no reason to ever do the hearts unless I’m grinding out the purple crystals.
---
I agree, this release just feels super anemic.
---
Honestly it would be pretty ballsy to keep her dead, and I’d actually kinda like it.
---
On the other hand, they just gave Caithe a new purpose after not knowing what to do with her for a while, and there’s so many hints like Ogden mentioning Joko’s passing was important, Glint having a secret talk with Aurene and Aurene probably having some of Joko’s lich magic in her as well as Kralky’s face being partially Aurene-branded in the last cutscene. Just makes me think she’s only dead temporarily, or if she stays dead she will somehow still have done something to move the plot forward.
---
Also, Aurene died to him in every one of her visions, but Kralk also saw a vision without him. Feels like her passing was going to happen either way then, but Kralk is also going to die later on somehow. 
---
Dunno, there are like 24/7 mesmer portals up if you take a look at lfg. Plus it's not really meta locked if you can buy the meta rewards over tp. Prices will likely go down in a few days or weeks too.
---
They can't just drop Awakened Sylvari and not give us THE GODDAMN CULTURALS. COME ON
---
Theorycrafting:
---
&gt; dragon can see visions of the future
---
&gt; dragon foresees death
---
&gt; dragon consumes Joko in a way that seems awkward at the time
---
----
---
&gt; [... Profit?](#s ... body gets bodysnatched next episode by an unknown faction, and having nothing better to do than sulk, you decide to follow them, and suddenly, you have dragons getting raised from the dead because a group of the fanatic necromancers think they can bring back their leader if they free him from the dragon that consumed him.) 
---
now with antlers!
---
My story as a ranger charr not sure if it changes with race or not but I cant get this mob to follow me lvl 15 story
---
My hope is that we go on a big quest to resurrect aurene, but it comes at a price. We also bring back our beloved King Joko.
---
If you are even a little bit active in this subreddit, you will see this exact same question everyday. And everyday it gets answered.
---
I'd say the guano hp is the most requested. The bat dude is pretty hard to solo. The frog guy as well.
---
Golem I've solod many times, literally just need a good amount of dodges/evades so he cant pull you and then a ranged weapon and you're set. The one down the vines near the start has a small fight but it's hardly difficult.. granted it's not just exploration, I feel those ones are easily solo-able with a bit of practice whereas the guano and frog HP's pretty much require a group
---
I've done 9/11 in verdant brink on all classes relatively easily and the last two I listed were the only ones I needed continuous help with.
---
Even Dutch van der Linde is ashamed of us at this point.
---
I'd like to think that too, but FWIK she's only recalled her past conversations with him when she was hanging out in Camp Resolve learning about advanced metallurgy from that one Iron Legion Charr. 
---
I assume when said Charr was busy doing something for the Pact, she wandered around and pestered people who she felt were smart enough to impart information to her. And one of those people was Trahearne.
---
My main is Ranger. I liked the idea of Human, Norn or Sylvari. Sylvari and Norn had an advantage because cultural appropriateness. Then I noticed they all had different choices of starting pets. While the Norn pets are pretty cool, Sylvari get a freaking leaf-dog. I'm not sure why it didn't click that I could get a leaf-dog regardless of race, but it didn't and I made a Sylvari Ranger to get the freaking leaf-dog.
---
Main reason I don't put money in the game anymore. I haven't enjoyed WvW in a long time.
---
you can walk around lion’s arch and half the interactable objects will mention her being dead, lol
---
It ain’t much but it’s honest work
---
Yea I said it’s due to a lack of having a better word for describing this behavior. It’s especially weirding me out since GW2 wanted to break up this behavior of stealing someone else’s last hit or heart progression item 
---
The ways that I imagine that he'd come back at this point would not exactly cheapen his sacrifice, but would emphasize how much of a mess resulted from how he died.
---
Like, we'd run into him in The Mists, and he's... not doing great, due to being partially possessed by Mordremoth.
---
I enjoyed D/D ele though, played it as a might stacker back in the beginning. Probably not optimal but I had a year full of fun with it!
---
It's a shame the only thing they replaced was the vision crystal, making these much more time and money intensive than a normal ascended weapon.
---
Jade constructs littered the floe. Not even a corpse? Not even debris at the bottom of the water in ice floe? It's only been about 200+ years, not 2,000. There are still civil war relics being unearthed in the U.S.
---
Just as long as the legions remember to do their business *in the litterbox* and **not on the living room rug.**
---
I've been that way for a while now too. I come back for the story updates but every single time they release more bullshit where you have to spend 100+ hours getting a handful of AP, a few skins, and more inventory bloat. I get that there needs to be stuff to do but I've already put 5000+ hours into this 6.5 year old game. I've got shit to do and it's too much effort for how little you get. If I farm every LS achievement point I only need like 500 more seasons to get to 60k.
---
I already have many legendaries, thousands of skins, have done fractals and raids endlessly. Why the fuck would I grind Thunderhead Keep for the new Branded Mass or whatever it is for yet another set of weapon skins. It's grind just for the sake of grind. 
---
This games general path diverged from my interests a while ago. Everything is increasingly gated. Daily, weekly. For children and those with no responsibilities that's fine but there can be periods of time spanning months where I don't have enough time for video games. But if I get a weekend of time to binge, it does me no good because this game is increasingly built around keeping people logging in daily and doing tedious work so that gemstore offers can be dangled in front of their eyes. 
---
It works for some people but I'm just not into it.
---
Would love play fractals with a dev. Just for the feels. Must be a night time shift tho, I guess there aren't any devs that plays when EU is up :'D
---
Sorry, I misspoke. I didn't mean the mission entirely, just the portion where you're actually fighting in the keep. Same basic premise as the meta.
---
My take: Aurene will use her lich powers she got from Joko, but in order to use she needs to take the life of one of here minions (that's kind of how lich's immortality works IIRC ?), so Caithe will have to sacrifice herself for Aurene to come back to life. That's why she was branded, otherwise that would have been pretty pointless to develop her character that way if Aurene just died in the last instance.﻿  
---
Only 400 gems! WAIT! Gems are blue. Aurene is blue! Gems are Aurene, everyone! ANet Gems are Aurene!
---
They are in the other maps
---
Plate prices are going to drop over time, aren't they?
---
&gt; Let's not forget that Glint wanted to talk to Aurene about the ascension privatelly. We don't know what she told her.
---
You highlighted the point I was so happy to hear about after the trial and gave much joy to Caiths new connection. Additionally, we got a important hint of how dragons acts. What I needed to highlight here:
---
&gt;He foresaw the possibility of a world at peace. \[...\] A world without him.
---
Noted that Kralk had similar powers and needed to overthink how threatening the possibility could be, means that the following quote of Glint:
---
&gt;To use power responsibly is to know when and how to share it - and when not to use it at all.
---
... marks down as a common knowledge for all dragons and one reason why they even use Champions: to not blow up their living space.
---
This is adding up to the behaviour of Mordremoth and why he used Ceara: to level down his own power and to try to regain his lost seed for new possible champions: the mother tree.  
---
The last quote also highlights my favourite part of fact you noted here:
---
&gt;She ate Joko she has his magic.
---
So I really hope you're right about her death.
---
See, if I were referring to the T4 of this fractal, I could understand this non-argument. However, this is beginner level. I do fractals daily, and even the occasional raid. I'm not a new or bad player. The second group I was with was competent. It was still disproportionately difficult for a T1 fractal, which is where the newcomers to fractals are going to be playing. I feel that this should be adjusted for first tier of fractals. 
---
Then we are both biased though because you are also disregarding various flaws or absence in Episode 5. You didn't touch really the lack of mount races or bounties. No didn't really disagreed with the lack of collections *outside the ones involved in the weapon crafting*. 
---
So it goes full circle, really.
---
&gt;  they're there and implemented much better than stuff like the Elegy Armor sets. 
---
Opinions. At least with the elegy armors we got the possibility to dye it at will, giving the armor skins a more versatile purpose. Not so much with the weapons. It's even worse considering each require a definite amount of laurels so you're bound to artificially wait in-between.
---
While the Elegy Armor quests involved a random Sigil and lots of map currencies, at least you can work toward these between steps. Can't say the same about laurels.
---
I appreciate the idea of each weapons having its own quest but I won't get to experience them until X days or unless I hoard laurels.
---
&gt; So 30 min per hour is filled, and inbetween there's still stuff like the skritt event that spawns a lot, etc.
---
No, 15 min per hour is filled. Thunderhead Keep plays at maybe XX:45, then Oil Meta at X+1:45, then Thunderhead Keep at X+2:45. 
---
I spent yeterday 20 min flying around the map searching for an event. That never happened before in previous releases, because either there was a bounty, a mount races going on or a simple event. It's pointless to do a big map if you cannot fill it.
---
&gt;  It makes the map much bigger, much more engaging to explore, a real sense of size. It's used in a lot of the hidden stuff in the map like the dwarven chests, dwarven catacombs, etc.
---
None of which is hardly replayable. The grandiose feeling is nice the first time, but beyond that point? In Dragon's Stand we fly around Mordremoth and between various isles, we drop bombs. Episode 5 introduced the Dragonsblood Spear and we can use them from our mounts but their use never went beyond the keep meta or the story instances. Would have been a perfect opportunity to use the verticality.
---
As for the exploration, it didn't feel any different from HoT's maps or various PoF's map. While I get to use my griffon more often, I still ended using my Springer's jump all around anyway. I'm not trying to dismiss the quality they put into designing the map, it's really not that,  exploring was fun, but exploration is not what makes an episode replayable.
---
&gt; every weapon has its own collection and little lore set
---
Except there is no way for a players to know or study these unless he have laurels to begin with. Gating the very first part of the main attraction of the episode was a dumb move. Laurels are given at specific moments during the monthly daily reward logins. Tough luck if you have none and you're days away from it.
---
&gt; You mention in your original post a lot of things in Jahai that are also present in Thunderhead that you conveniently ignore. 
---
Except I said Thunderhead keep was beautiful visually? But alright let me develop these points:
---
* It hardly respect GW1's geography so you can't really make many throwbacks, not as well a Jahai Buff.
---
* The catacomb puzzles were good, but to do them you're reliant on two key dropped with the hourly meta events and even so you're given access to 3 random rooms out of 5. Doesn't really motivate me to invest my time in this.
---
* Most Dwarven Chests are isolated, so you have to go out of your way to even reach them... For one chunk of crystal and *maybe* a rare unid kit.
---
&gt; Then you state stuff about Thunderhead that's just plain false
---
&gt; 2 dwarven weapon skins, hidden title for crafting an ascended of your choice, etc
---
You mention two things and imply more with an "etc", but there is no etc. Two weapon skins and a title for crafting a weapon (that is gated behind laurels) is very little compared to the various unlocks of Sun Refuge, the optional Golem quest + 4 weapon from Sandwsepth Isles, or the two weapons + tool unlock progression from Istan.
---
"no collection **outside** the weapon set", gotta read better :P
---
&gt; 2 adventures definitely count
---
But still no mount races (which have a multiplayer aspect), no bounties (which are group events), no maze events (multiplayer). I guess I just have different definition of "minigames".
---
&gt; Then you have criticism that applies to the maps you praise as well that you're selling as specific to Thunderhead, like Most achievements also have a grindy nature + long cooldown between metas
---
It's a question of context. I'd take grindy achievements *along with other type of content* any time. I will also take a long cooldown between metas *as long as I can be kept busy between*. But none of that applies to Thunderhead keep. Rifts are infrequent, Pepperseed is hard to locate when it's activated, the Skritt Archaeologist is probably the most frequent event but how long until you get bored?
---
&gt; If you keep the big faults of other maps in mind (like Jahai lacking almost all replayability since most of it is one time content, bounties and races only being run for achievements once by most people, etc.) Thunderhead actually comes out near/on top.
---
While I can't argue against Jahai lacking a bit of replayability, it definitely didn't fall short on the rest and kept me entertained and motivated for a while. I'm two days in Thunderhead Keep and I'm not remotely interested in pursuing. 
---
Reducing the cooldown from events and removing the first laurel gating from the weapon crafting would actually give a better pacing and a better sense of purpose to various players who are starting the episode with no laurel.
---
Also, one meta reward per account per day is also way too little and prevent people from investing their time and energy in these meta events for the Plate keys.
---
More rift events wouldn't hurt, actually, I think they have a problem spawning which doesn't help.
---
Awakening is still corruption, but it's different from dragon corruption.  They, and other freed awakened, say that Joko's will bore down upon them, and they were compelled to obey.  
---
One of the biggest things separating Joko's Awakening from dragon corruption was that you did not have to obey the will of Joko if you couldn't hear the will of Joko.  Hense Koss.  
---
Actually, their description of being under the influence of Awakening magic smacks of descriptions of what Sylvari were exposed to when Mordremoth was trying to take them.  
---
I always think Sylvari were meant to be just normal elves in early art like this of them
---
These was not a hint of cantha anywhere....
---
The seed is inside, like Mordremoth.
---
Unfortunately, she was introduced and killed as part of the season 1 temporary content. The replayable story picks up a short time after her death, investigating what she had done and why. 
---
With diverners gear, might share deadeye might be a thing?
---
Also if I’m correct maw just doesn’t reset at least it didn’t used to. It’s a weird boss 
---
Mine was silent, thankfully.
---
I did appreciate that they also took Rytlock and Logan off from screaming at the fighters. Gorrik was still bitching about camp logistics, but oh well.
---
My hubby and I play together every night. I would love to one day be able to get this and the pvp acheivement with him (pvp is our nightly ritual). Hes be so excited.
---
Story is getting better and better. The only thing that annoyed me a bit was that my character was stuck 3 times within rocks flying around after explosions. Had to restart the last part. Fortunately keeps your progression.
---
Thank goodness they got rid of the "tripping and falling over" condition. Although I miss the "I have a castle on top of my health bar" boon and they need to add it back.
---
Can't wait to get it in my guild 
---
If you're in a story instance (or any instance without a waypoint) the /stuck command works. You just have to make sure not to hit a key for 30 seconds and it will remove you to a checkpoint. 
---
Hmm in that case what's written in the guide is false. I'll try that tomorrow if I find a couple of people to speed things up.
---
Unless you have the reward ding happen right as it fades to black like I did
---
Most if not all the most recently added fractals appear to not be balanced correctly at lower level as the difficulty is not in range of the original and LWS1 ones.
---
On the other hand it's been 2.5 years that they seem to only cater for the hardcore players so I am happy I stopped doing fractals altogether. It used to be short and fun (except for those farms or Mossman abuses), it's not anymore.
---
the real test of will is just getting where you need to go.
---
*checks flair* Well, glad I never got rid of my flair... it'll be fun to  know if it is still relevant.
---
Same. In near 10k hours I've never seen an Anet tag ingame, so these kinds of achievements seem to be off for me. I guess that's the disadvantage when you get paired with Germans all the time (as I am one myself) :D
---
&gt;!It hurts me that she never got to come to her new nest and see how many people loved and cherished her.!&lt;
---
&gt; Jade constructs littered the floe. Not even a corpse? Not even debris at the bottom of the water in ice floe? It's only been about 200+ years, not 2,000. There are still civil war relics being unearthed in the U.S.
---
Above the waterfall there is a mastery point that is a jade construct.  
---
Depends on what your goal is. Survive in open world maps, feel confident with all the abilities the class has and able to swap utilities as needed, do presentable dps in fractals or raids, get good at pvp/wvw, etc.? Tune the practice activities to fit.
---
Survive in open world - start from easiest, kill mobs in core Tyria, try some veterans and champions. Go to PoF and try mobs there. Go to HoT.
---
Figure out what’s blocking progress. Lack of understanding of the mob types you’re facing and the optimal strategy for taking them on (from range or melee? are things like condi cleanse or blocks or stability or reflect needed?) 
---
Or lack of understanding of the classes’ tools for dealing with the above, ie. cue wiki skills reading time. 
---
Or lack of willingness to switch skills from a group raid optimised meta to deal with a solo open world situation without the support it presupposes, cue openness to experiment and trial and error some things.
---
If your goal is to optimize dps in a group setting, then well, the strategy changes. Do the required research from website and video guides, maybe even do your own wiki and theory construction for deeper understanding. Put in the practice at the combat dummy with arcdps on to refine theory and muscle memory. Start looking for available mobs that have similar chunkiness in health to practice in a more live setting - I personally found bounties pretty helpful, but other avenues are open world champions, open world metas, fractals, easier raids, etc.
---
Basically, just use a bit of targeted analysis and deliberate practice to shortcut the otherwise subconscious trial-and-error process that would happen over time by trudging through the whole game again.
---
The "create your own" content argument is nothing more than a cop-out, always used to justify a game that fails to produce adequate content. The initial releases of No Man's Sky and Fallout 76 are good recent examples of this, and I see many of the same arguments used to justify the shortcomings of those games now being applied here.  
---
"Just play another game between updates" They say.  
---
"GW2 is an easy game to come back to so the lasting value of content doesn't matter" They say.  
---
But healthy games do not need to have these excuses made for them.  
---
The reality is, having to defend a game in any of these ways only proves it is falling below the reasonable expectation of what the game should be. That it has shortcomings that need to be addressed, not embraced.  
---
I wouldn’t necessarily call it trolling, and I do get their reasoning behind some of the points ( I personally would’ve liked to see some more armor skins or dwarven weapons as a continuation of the PoF ones for example )
---
But overall I enjoy the map a lot. I love the dwarves and everything related to them in this game so that’s a big plus, same goes for the snowy area. The map, while exploring desolate and abandoned regions, still feels more alive than any other LS map they released so far. The little details and visual storytelling are incredible. 
---
I can see myself going back to do events and hearts here just because they’re fun, which is honestly a thing I never thought I’d say about a LS map. 
---
And I want almost all of the Dragonsblood weapons so I have a decent long term goal now. It’s not the heaviest in terms of rewards, but what’s there is genuinely great imo.
---
It's same as other chests, depends on the distance.
---
e.g. Oil Slug meta, I just autolooted. North meta, you're often too far from it when it spawns - just like Chak meta chest.
---
Quite amazing that we kept you around for as long as we did, all I remember is that it was a big clown fiesta.
---
Either way, big thanks for not only helping me out with the raid achievement, but for taking me on a fractal and pvp tour aswell. Stay amazing! &lt;3
---
&gt;I'm not sure if it even appears on regular 100. ​
---
I've had invisible Arrk on regular 100 a few times. Sometimes it appears invisible to only 2 or 3 players in the party while the others can still see him. 
---
Hmmm. Maybe I should do a raid run through sometime. Give people a chance to get this achievement.
---
I will definitely need carrying.
---
Yeah, Twilight Oasis was/is also a major overtuning of just rando mob difficulty that it sounds like they just dialed back with this release, so I might just chalk it up to the usual "ANet doesn't play their own game".
---
What happens to those who want to get completion after this becomes stale content, and is abandoned? What about those who play at odd hours who can't get into good meta maps because it's dead when they play? I appreciate the mesmer portals, but completing a map shouldn't rely on either that or obtaining an item.
---
Also another thing to note is going the "normal" route of obtaining the item poses another issue - you can only gain access once per day per account. 
---
The title for a second made me expect a Drew Carey Scarlette crossover image. 
---
I just do Fractals and sell excess mats and I avg  a legendary about two months 
---
Damn. Now I gotta get good at raiding.
---
I don't know if I've randomly ran into an  Anet employee enough in my years playing since launch to know if this is even realistically possible.  Anet  employees: how many are you out there?
---
You should rename yourself to DedRam
---
omg i though just the same thing, the background music during all this chapter reminded me a lot to the style of the background temple like music of TLoS games lol
---
DBL had and still has many issues, most of which were clear since the closed beta test, with the lack of gliding perceived as one only being a symptom.
---
people aren't struggling with these lords (though they can be a challenge with very small groups), that doesn't mean they cannot dislike them, or regard them as nuisance.
---
HoT is harder and, arguably, poorly designed. The devs were enamored with playing as a party/group and HoT is basically based around/tuned for group play. The maps are best played as part of a "zerg" or massive group of people.
---
Nah.. she ate Joko, she retains his magic and will probably be able to come back at least once.  
---
Her visions of her death were there because, cough, 'there was no other way'. She couldn't see passed this because death was a wall that prevented it, but there is very likely more to her story.. and when we are in a pickle, Aurene will show up and save us out of nowhere. Another theory I saw is that she planted herself in Caithe through the Corru-.. Connection. She has Mordremoth's magic, Mordremoth did the same thing to Trahearne. 
---
Asura male VA nailed it, as always
---
Just put them in a safe slot
---
&gt; I did the Fractal twice at T4 yesterday.
---
So, you're saying you have no clue about the T1 experience. Wouldn't it have been shorter to just type that?
---
[I just googled Guild wars 2 October 2nd](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/56766/game-update-notes-october-2-2018)
---
[They're also on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/October_2018) I found them by going to Game Updates and hitting archive.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah, this is why I'm iffy on Aurene being dead, which is a great thing since it's not something like before where plot points were either telegraphed with a sledgehammer (I wonder if Joko will escape the Domain of the Lost HMM) or not at all (Hey, fuck you I'm Balthazar now. And fuck THIS lesbian in particular!). While I get that, from a narrative perspective, keeping her dead is the smartest thing, it feels like they've added so many outs for themselves that it's going to feel equally BS to say that NONE of those somehow work.
---
The return on Auric Basin is higher than Istan in terms of Gold per Time spent.
---
Only issue is you can only do the meta every 2 hours.
---
The saddest part about Season 1 is explaining all the cool parts of it to people and having to say "parts were really cool!  but you'll never get to play them, since they were removed from the game." I did a recap with a few guildies last weekend, where I went through all my old unobtainable achievements and explained what happened for each one.  Funny things like "hit 10 signs" from S1E1, and cool ones like "escort 2000+ civilians" from fleeing from Lions Arch.  
---
Um, I meant the patch for the tenth on January. I just downloaded a patch an hour ago. \^\^'
---
Kralk was also very aware that he barely got out of that fight alive and with little energy left to stay and finish up. I do believe Aurene will return, I am very hopeful that this doesn't count as our fight with Kralk, and that we get another battle instance against him, because as epic as that one was, I don't want his actual death to be shown and not experienced.
---
Uninstalled. 
---
just adding on to this: as i see this you need 3360BM and 96 jewels for both collections. some serious grind.
---
And thats why im trying to get into green room every day and stay here for at least 2 hours to port some ppl here with my mesmer. Its still frustrating that they are blocking pois tho ._.
---
Is it too late to get in on this? :x
---
I feel like if they want to make Longform 5 man content they should just take the time to make a new dungeon.
---
The issue with long fractals is rewards don't scale, an sort fractal and a long fractal still give you the same daily t4 chest. If they made a dungeon aimed at lategame players, or even make paths different difficulties to accommodate more players like lower teir fractals do, they could fine tune the rewards to match the length and difficulty. 
---
If more and more long fractals come out then fractals get less lucrative, and players chase profits. 
---
You can comfortably tank most bosses with 1.5k toughness. The only boss where i run full minstrel/nomad is desmina. VG also hits quite hard on his autoattacks so i wouldnt tank it on 1k but 1.5k should be enough as long as you are distorting the greens.
---
No matter what people tell you, keep in mind to take enough toughness to make you comfortable.  Nobody's gonna give you a medal if you successfully tank vg on 1k toughness but people will be upset if they have to constantly res you. If you are inexperienced with tanking/chrono take as much toughness as you need. Nobody will judge your dps.
---
Maybe I'm not doing the efficient thing but I wouldn't want to auto salvage as the unidentified gear drops sell for decent prices at any rarity.
---
Anet sure has been binging the Marvel movies if a lot of that comes to pass. But yeh, I like the death was unavoidable idea!
---
ᕦ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ᕤ
---
What did you set your binds to?
---
Damn I got a deimos kill with someone from Anet a few months ago. 
---
&gt; specifically, the fate of your order mentors
---
Wait a minute, don't tell me something happens to Tybalt!
---
&gt;I can now move in any direction and cast skills at the same time.
---
Okay, this actually makes a bit of sense. Though technically you're still limited to combinations of forward, left, right, and back; using a controller doesn't enable analog movement or movement in more axes.
---
However, it's also common to hold right-click and just run forward all the time so that you can still use skills with your left hand while moving without putting them on different keys. It's also not as necessary because many skills can't be used while moving.
---
&gt;No more unwanted skill activations.
---
Just don't press the buttons on the keyboard/mouse!
---
&gt;I found a controller mapping that is perfect for GW2. 
---
I know this will be different based on personal preference and what profession you're playing, but you didn't even share it!
---
I checked Mist trinkets, now you can select Diviner stat. I don't know if there are more changes beside this.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also I bought LS3 trinket yesterday and selected Diviner stat. Those trinkets are still there w/o changes(phew).
---
As an English major, thank you for avoiding the deus-ex, haha.
---
Yeah, the biggest reason I think Aurene will come back is that we didn't really get a resolution to their relationship. Sure, we don't have a way to kill Kralk without blowing up the universe without her, and a way to not blow up the universe should have been around before to really justify that (and we know that it has to be a dragon, else Balthy taking it would have been fine), but the how-do-we-win conundrum is besides the point. If you only take the instance into account, their method for killing off Aurene was pretty much perfect. In a larger story, it would work as-is. The problem is, they don't just need to kill Kralk, they need to kill Kralk right now. Actually, even an end-of-the-world scenario could work well... if this was a larger story. It's the all hope is lost moment. It's when you rip out the audience's hearts. If you ever read something I write, be prepared to cry, because I absolutely love moments like this. Nobody kills of their main character... it's the main character. There is no story without them. What you need is a secondary main character to carry the torch. In the moment when only the main character can win (Harry Potter, Eragon, or really any Chosen One story), the main character HAS to survive. The Star Wars prequels worked because despite Anakin being the chosen one... we knew he was going to turn. We NEED Kralk to die, or the game just... ends. Turn off the servers. In Star Wars, Luke comes in as the second chosen one to win in the end. You have a build up, you have a variable period of time where it's only despair and no hope at all, and then you have a new hope (pun intended) and a new hero, chosen one, or newfound way to kill the enemy. This can be done in one story (I would consider Star Wars two stories), but you absolutely NEED that second method. Aurene is our only method. That's it. We can't just smite Kralk like we did Zhaitan. Even if our spears can kill him, if he dies, so does literally everything else in existence. Aurene IS the main character. She's the ONLY main character. There is no replacement. Either she's alive and takes Kralk's power... or nothing.
---
We've spent all this time building up their relationship, but there is no moment of downfall. There is no period of time in which we can despair and then find the right answer. Even if there was, all we had with Aurene was buildup. We never actually had a real and proper moment where we saw ourselves with her at the peak of her power and the end of her story. This was the middle of her story. This is the moment when the hero is defeated and then comes back and hits back just as hard. In GW2 terms, this is when the commander dies. This is when the entire pact fleet is massacred over the jungle. But when the commander dies, we know they're going to come back, because Anet didn't delete our characters and give us a start from scratch. We knew we could still take on Modremoth without the fleet because the people were still alive. It would be difficult, certainly, but possible. Without Aurene, and without a deus-ex, this is impossible. They could take the time episode-wise to establish a new method, as this was the last episode of the season, and the next step is the next season, but considering the world is ending, that not only leaves them with very little time chronologically (which is essential for establishing a new solution), but also defeats the entire purpose behind Aurene. If she's just going to die like this, what was the point in her being in the story at all?
---
Here's... actually... the only real way I see a proper resolution to this plotline with no Aurene at all is with other dragons. Elder Dragons. Wake them up, have them stomp Kralk. Why would they? Because he's going to literally devour the universe itself... which logically includes them. Or fetch Bubbles and watch the showdown. But even that seems... off... the Jormag and Primordius went to sleep before Kralk started doing his thing, but Bubbles isn't really doing anything. So I don't think they really care. And we'd still need a proper container for Kralk's power, and as I said, we know that even Balthy containing it would have ended the universe, so it has to be a dragon. There are ways to kill Kralk, but the only way to not kill everything else at the same time is with Aurene. (I mean, I guess we could try cleansing another dragon, but we're a little short on time and that's... yeah...)
---
Realistically, the next season is going to start with the Commander in despair, remembering their own ressurection, and then saying to hell with it and going headfirst into the mists to bring back Aurene. "If I can come back, so can she."
---
Last quick note, I dislike the Joko theory. I think it's a major cop-out. She's also a dragon, so her magic is going to work differently than Joko's, or he probably would have tried anything to bring back Glint or another dragon champion.
---
Ah, sorry for the long reply.
---
lol i wish. i gamble at least 3 times a week buying united rare and then using an alt amounts mystic stones to try for a pre. but yesterday i really felt like i broke the game. opened 100 BL chests and got a glyph and a super rare skin with some smaller rares. but nothing too crazy and i was too tired to try the new LS. so i gambled and 3 pre's was unheard of to me all within 10 minutes.
---
How is the game atm? I haven't touched it since last june (2018). Has there been any big content updates or anything like that?
---
Would be handy when replaying it for achievements on your main character for sure. Though I would say most of the reason I replay the story on alts is to hear the different race/gender combos' voice lines (since the rewards aren't too good).
---
I'm using a DS4. 
---
In short: 
---
right buttons - skills/menus/mounts
---
left buttons - interact/shift/alt/weapon swap.
---
L2/R2 - modifier for skills
---
L1/R1 - mouse click
---
touchpad - targeting/zoom
---
L3 - action camera 
---
R3 - mount/skill5
---
Share - ESC
---
Options - special skill/settings
---
PS - Map
---
What is your other contender for best patch?
---
I've heard nothing but good things about that VA. Unfortunately I've only made one male asura but I don't really connect with him enough to play him often.
---
I'll have to do something about that.
---
This.
---
You somehow made that group look better than the one I run weekly raids with, I'm really impressed with how easy you make explaining bosses look. Definitely going to have to use some of your tips, especially your Sab explanation. Love the training vids!
---
Charr male VO in this episode was just awesome, the last line give chills down de my spine (I... dont know)
---
Could easily be argued that a lot of this was in design and planned far ahead of when the movie released though. It takes a bit more than a few months to push out these stories, yet alone the design and coding around them, I think they just shared a lot of similarity, but if you think about the overall concept of future sight, it isn't even something that stands alone with Infinity War to look ahead to multiple outcomes.. I think there was even a Nick Cage movie where he can see like 2 minutes into the future and he just keeps going through several timelines within that 2 minute future sight in order to get the 'best' route to go for himself, such as moving out of the way of gunshots and other action sequences.
---
It's a team building exercise in futility. 
---
Same thing happened to me in the last damage phase, i used a blink attack and my char got stucked inside kralk
---
Even if you do manage to get that pre-event to fail, there are only 10 soldiers in the next one for everybody. The brand crystal they're in is extremely weak so they'll all be broken out in seconds. I've done the soldier event twice now and gotten credit for 1 soldier. The rest of the time, the pre-event doesn't fail or it just bugs out entirely.
---
If Arenanet doesn't patch this somehow then it'll just have to do be done late at night 2-3+ months from now when everybody has deserted this map.
---
I don't get why they keep adding events which require a previous event to fail. You'd have figured they know it was a terrible idea from all those times they've done it before e.g. the precursor collections. It just has a feel that they're browsing through the list of individual events in isolation when coming up with achievements and nobody bothers to check what is necessary to trigger it. Doesn't feel like there is a lot of testing either -.- Does somebody just make up a bunch of achievements 10 minutes before shipping a LS episode??
---
No, we killed Joko too early to have this.
---
They're up now. RIP SKRITT MATH!
---
What for... is it hard to click 2 buttons and salvage it yourself? 
---
Really dont knopw, but many of the people waiting for meta on squad (including me) had like 3 game crashes already.
---
Oh so glad they fixed that. Was jokingly offering 100g in map chat to whoever threw that skritt off the cliff.
---
Name 24 of them.
---
I miss there being the compass and a separate map like in GW1.  It was really nice having a compass that showed the enemy units as red dots, with an aggro bubble around yourself so you could attempt to avoid fights when need be.
---
It's not really corruption, since the idea of corruption is something that fundamentally transforms a material into something else, while removing the mind and will and creating a hivemind.
---
Awakening is just typical undeath with underlying mental hooks to enforce servitude.
---
The two are very similar - particularly to Zhaitan's corruption given the undeath motif - but they're not close enough to say they're both corruption.
---
And it should be noted that the Mordrem Guard weren't corrupted either - their body's change was a part of standard sylvari physiology, though to an extreme (we see this in use with Scarlet, Caithe, and Canach), and their minds were never enslaved and their will removed. They also didn't have a proper dragon hive mind, but was merely subject to telepathy via the Dream (which itself is repeatedly stated to not be a hive mind).
---
Friendly tip, instead of saying "English is not my mother language," it sounds more natural to say "I am not a native English speaker"
---
i found her cute and likeable :,D
---
Oh, thank you for the tip XD
---
I think I saw you today actually. Lol 
---
Alright so my original statement stands...though the .bat file works, it would be sexier as a pure PowerShell script :-)
---
No please, don't think of the children. D:
---
I've always wondered how this game would play with a controller, I'll have to test your bindings out. :D
---
I cried earlier and now I’m crying again. I hope you’re happy! 
---
At least we have mounts now, just think that people had to traverse these maps without them
---
It's important to note:
---
&gt;**Glint:** I am not yet prepared to face the Elder Dragon—and distressingly, I cannot see beyond the coming battle.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**Glint:** Is it because I die? I can't die without finishing my work. I have to stop Kralkatorrik. 
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystalline\_Memories#In\_Glint.27s\_Lair](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystalline_Memories#In_Glint.27s_Lair)
---
Glint could not see past her death. So how could she prophecize Joko's death, let alone Aurene's birth?
---
The Snowcrows build (full dps with just a few boon duration thrown in) assumes that you play with two chronos and have a solid party who consistently stands in your wells/ToT/etc - if you’re most pugging raids, you’ll want more boon duration than what they recommend. I’d recommend running enough diviner’s gear to get you to around 40-50% boon duration to be safe. The rest can then be usual zerks/assassin’s.
---
Fractals is completely different - since you only have 1 chrono, and fractals are frequently chaotic enough that you can’t guarantee everyone will always be in your wells, you’ll want to get to 100% boon duration so you can keep up boons as long as possible. 15% of that will come from fractal pots so you can just aim for 85% bd.
---
Regarding whether it’s worth to swap or not - you should definitely be running enough boon duration to support your party if you want to be a support chrono, so it sounds like you’ll need to swap some gear anyway to hit at least 40% boon duration. Easiest way to do this is via trinkets - trinkets contribute way more to your stats than your armor does. Also consider using pack runes or leadership runes instead of firebrand for boon duration - the firebrand runes assume that you perfectly hit everyone with Tides of Time to cover alacrity, which will frequently not be the case.
---
Maybe, I was on for a short bit. Just let me know and I'll help you open the maps, get elite specs and a f'ton o'MPs. 
---
Alternate take from the Deus Ex Joko idea for Season 5;
---
While we did spend the entire instance poking it in the eye, Kralky didn't lose it until the final beam battle with Aurene.  Along with now missing an eye and it also backed off instead of finishing us like it could have. Also I think the color was slightly bluer when it left. 
---
I'm thinking that Aurene partially branded Kralky (and thus making it somewhat subject to her will) and Season 5 will see us trying to come up with a way to strengthen her influence over it.
---
Replace them all with a crafting material
---
Called “The Hero's Journey“ 
---
One of the oldest concepts in storytelling. 
---
The concept fits well with Aurene as hero; especially when you remember the commander's line, that we never looked at the situation from Aurene's perspective (context was surely another, but I started to rethink about her story/life from ls2 untill today).
---
More info here for convenience:
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey?wprov=sfla1
---
**Hero's journey**
---
In narratology and comparative mythology, the monomyth, or the hero's journey, is the common template of a broad category of tales that involve a hero who goes on an adventure, and in a decisive crisis wins a victory, and then comes home changed or transformed.The study of hero myth narratives started in 1871 with anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor's observations of common patterns in plots of heroes' journeys. Later on, others introduced various theories on hero myth narratives such as Otto Rank and his Freudian psychoanalytic approach to myth, Lord Raglan's unification of myth and rituals, and eventually hero myth pattern studies were popularized by Joseph Campbell, who was influenced by Carl Jung's view of myth. In his 1949 work The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell described the basic narrative pattern as follows:
---
A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.
---
Campbell and other scholars, such as Erich Neumann, describe narratives of Gautama Buddha, Moses, and Christ in terms of the monomyth.

Many WvW veterans would prefer if you could not upgrade SM at all so it always stay paper or is just a building on the map that we can fight in. 
---
If someone own a tier 3 SM, the map instantly get stale and boring. To many SM huggers and pipfarmers occupie it contributing with nothing but taking up slots from players that want to get in and actaully play the game mode and not hug SM sitting on siege or repairing walls for pip farming. 
---
Forcing SM to only be paper would make a lot more fights happening between the servers because defending it is not as easy as a tier 3 fully siege are. 
---
I participate in the meta events once after story and uninstall the game. I don't find any motivation to play this game further than that as metas are just mindless Zerg, I don't even need to be in group then right click and salvage and then further right click and eat mf.
---
Worst part is achievements tied to replaying story missions. I hate this shit I already played them and I saw it all. Now I don't need to play the story again at specific moments just because I took some damage or didn't kill boss in 6 mins, these kinds achievements are complete bullshit, its like forcing you to do challenge runs in dark souls and I will definitely try to do that  in a game that has built in mechanics to achieve such feats where as this game is like not designed for that.
---
So I find guild wars 2 utterly boring after doing story and meta for first time. This game will just benefit from being a co-op instance(open world is an instance) game with story dungeons type encounters and no leveling.
---
There are so many players out there in WvW who do not give a crap about PvE. Forcing them to care is not really what they want. 
---
And if anything we do not need more visually clutter in WvW. It is terrible as it is now already. 
---
What do you want then.
---
How would you use chat?
---
The other preview article that came out said "penultimate episode," so I wonder if that was just a miscommunication.
---
You gotta know the right places. Ive also had the game since 2012 and i have probably 30+ Dev sightings. I say hi every time. 
---
*hint* a couple of them can be found in PVP mists lobby often
---
I think I saw maybe one event outside of the metas? I was exploring yesterday and already have 97% map complete. Usually I like to just join in on events as they happen but I only found one. It feels very big and beautiful and like I want to be in the zone more, but it feels like there’s nothing to do. 
---
I really hope we find an eidolon or seer corpse anywhere nearby as well^^
---
There was tons of PvE when the map came out. The whole middle area was PvE and lagged out the whole map to a point were we could not even walk on the map when it was up.  The lords still are painful and annoying as hell. I want to fight players in Lords room not deal with a raid boss whilst doing so. 
---
I mean we can easy turn it around. What if next PvE raid is in WvW and you as a PvE raider are forced to participate in it to get your weekly raid loot and everything else. I mean come on is it hard to kill the boss? No but you do PvE raids for bosses not for other players to kill you whilst doing so. WvW players are there to kill other players not to to jump waves or deal with a teleporting bosses who knock you over or fear you off when you trying to have a fun fight with other players.
---
Textures for the racing scarf appear to have glitched, it's now way too shiny and even the darkest dyes will only show up as a pale grey.
---
One day :/......maybe!
---
Huh, could be. Now they definitely need to clarify things.
---
On one hand, this episode had a very powerful ending and I could see it being a conclusion to this season. On the other hand, it doesn't necessarily have a hype ending, so maybe ANet wants to end the season on a more determined note.
---
Links need to be removed now, servers need to merge, torunaments need to be added. All this is something that already been in the game so i do not belive it take as much work to fix as the alliances. 
---
RIP Blish 😢
---
Bring back Joko, and Awaken Aurene. Problem solved!
---
But I want to succeed...
---
So, here are the title statues I have left:
---
* Eternal Champion
---
* Eternal Commander
---
* Eternal Skillz
---
* Eternal Gladiator
---
* Eternal Hero
---
* Eternal Defender of Ascalon 
---
* Eternal Savior of the Luxons
---
* Eternal Treasure Hunter
---
* Eternal Source of Wisdom
---
* Eternal Conqueror of the Deep
---
* Eternal Conqueror of Urgoz's Warren
---
* Eternal Conqueror of the Underworld
---
* Eternal Conqueror of the Domain of Anguish
---
* Eternal Codex Disciple
---
Of those, the following are hard areas I've basically accepted i can't do unless someone ends up carrying me:
---
The following ones are pvp related, and i've never done pvp, nor do I really wish to:
---
This leaves the following titles I could earn to finish HoM:
---
Defender of ascalon requires a new character spending a long time reaching lv20, treasure hunter requires like 10k lockpicks, and source of wisdom requires like 10k unid items.
---
My plan is to get luxons to 4, but that will take a somewhat decent amount of time.
---
In my estimate, I would have either (a) gotten GWAMM at the same time, since all the GWAMM titles count here, or (b) gotten GWAMM first, since again all the GWAMM titles count here...
---
Unless I'm severely miscalculating how easy the PVP titles are? Or people are jsut assuming the difficult group areas are "easy" and thus "done"? Sure I could have gotten the wisdom or treasure hunter, but as far as I know those have to be maxed, meaning that I actually would benefit GWAMM if i did those. The only one left that doesn't require max for HoM is the luxon faction one?
---
So, at least to me, a player who pretty much solo'd the game, GWAMM was easier than finishing HoM, especially when you compound that basically all of GWAMM helps out the hall, while you also have to acquire minis, weapons, armors, and such on top of that?
---
But again, I'm probably missing that I could have gotten some of the titles without maxing out GWAMM, so maybe my estimation is only true if you attempt to solo only...
---
People on Reddit just love ripping open my wounds like this 😭😭😭😭😭
---
I would bet that we're going to Kralkatorrik's original resting place in the the Charr homelands for the finale, since that's the last bit of map pixel changes from like a year ago that hasn't amounted to anything yet.
---
Thanks for the confirmation.... it was soooo hard not to buy all new trinkets yesterday (even though I had prepped all five Mist ones). 
---
i think i have a better shot at getting into Anet as a dev and getting carried than carrying one
---
What series is that from?
---
RIP mapwide Skritt Announcement System
---
What disortion is there other than the scythe?
---
*whispers in your ear* "Eat the salad.... eat the salad...."
---
Too bad I can't get this retroactively, I did a fair amount of raiding with a dev some time back...
---
I want links to be removed, servers to be merged, torunaments to be added so that we actaully have a valid reason to be more competative. Links are not working at all. Reducing the servers and giving the players on those servers a free move to those left would fix the rollercostar that server going through. Being host, loosing people to links, being link, gaining people, being host, loosing people to link and so it goes.
---
I also want them to remove the desert border. And i know there are some players who like the red border but the fact is that it is the least played border and most players feel they are punnished being red.
---
I want to remove upgrades on SM and let it only be paper. SM makes EB stale and boring. When it is paper a lot of fights and interactions are going on. Whilst being tier 3 we have tons of siege huggers and pipfarmers reparing walls taking up slots doing nothing at all for their server. SM have so many spots to place siege on that are not possible to deal with. It also have tactivators that are pretty dumb such as the airship defens, looks damn awsome i know, but is just dumb.
---
^ This x999999
---
I mean, they *are* the dragons of Life and Death. Convenient.
---
Someone slap an eye patch on him! Arrr!
---
Honestly I feel like that's one of the bigger weaknesses of the game. These days not much carries over to future content, I don't feel any reason to work on Sun's Refuge if it loses all relevance when the next episode releases y'know.
---
I love when map chat devolves into frustration and name calling
---
More chaos please
---
Makes it double as sad when you only raid with your guild and don't have the time or nerves to pug them on top of the weekly schedule. Devs are a rare sight to behold as is, but expecting them to *find you* is like hoping for a needle to jump out of a haystack and into your hands.
---
The "kill a dev in PvP" one appeared in the game right after I finished my backpack grind and decided to take a long break from the gamemode. Now the knowledge of the existance of a raiding achievement of similar kind will forever tantalize the achivement hunter in me. :(
---
I'm not crying! YOU ARE!
---
*sob*
---
Starting to not be able to stand fractals. I found a pretty regular pug group that starts 15 minutes before reset, but sometimes I get home and logged in minutes too late and miss them.
---
If I get in with them, everything runs smoothly and we are done in 45m-1h. If not... christ, PUGs seem to get fucking more and more stupid the farther you get from reset. It honestly makes me not want to play, ever. Now I'm not claiming to be some fractal god but for fucks sake, they're not really that fucking hard.
---
I plugged some values into dT's gear optimizer with duel/illu and came away with the following loadout (pieces mentioned are Diviner, rest are Assassin):
---
All trinkets minus 1 accessory
---
Chest and legs
---
All weapons (2x sword, shield, focus)
---
No stat infusions, leadership runes, force/impact sigils, and superior sharpening and power/ferocity food. To get 100% boon duration without fractal potion (i.e. if you're raiding or something), just swap out food/utility to concentration consumables and you're there. Same gear. I dunno if these are optimal combinations, this is just what the tool told me. Seems like a pretty good setup to me. You can move some things around and use Scholar runes, their damage score was generally lower on combos I plugged in using those.
---
Which one is that?
---
So what you're saying is that it's easy for one person to troll the map by completing an event?
---
It was a pretty cringey moment but it paid off when he told my character "you're a tall glass of water yourself," to which my asura responded, "uh, you and I *both* know that's not true"
---
Cleared it in T1 (it was a rec) first try with a pug group yesterday, in 5-10mins. Some quick pointers for the last boss:  
---
\- Dodge the wind gust AOEs (this is pretty telegraphed, and has about the same timing as the wind gust AOEs in Deepstone; you have quite a bit of reaction time to dodge out)  
---
\- Dodge the Captain's AOE attack (roughly 120 degrees, telegraphed, giving you plenty to time/space to move out)  
---
\- Break CC bars (although iirc there aren't that many, its pretty much just DPS)  
---
\- Don't stay in the water, you take damage over time; get back up on the ship asap  
---
\- Bring AOE cleave (this is probably true for all fractals in general though)
---
Tbh I think that the difficulty was well balanced, with the pre-events giving you plenty of opportunity to learn the mechanics. Once you have the mechanics all laid out, with everyone knowing what to do, you'll find yourself having a much easier time. Give it a month, and I'm willing to wager people are gonna start complaining about how easy it is.
---
For the the achievement "It's getting hot in here" uequip your armor and back piece once you're inside the dwarven sauna (blue plate) before you proceed, right past the entrance.
---
Yes, the list of fractals that they should remove it from is: all fractals.
---
The list of fractals that its ok, and fun, in are: none of them.

Agreed. I still hear Taimi chirping about being a dragon interior designer and Faren bragging about his stint in Kourna... but I came there to hold vigil for Aurene, and that's what I'm going to do.
---
Let's be honest, "very experienced" fractal players are not likely to be doing T3 dailies.
---
I remember seeing those stats in pvp and thinking dang wish I could get that for pve. Now that I can get it I kinda dont want to. I'm waiting for someone else to tell me I need to lol!
---
I'm in the same boat. Someone else needs to crunch the numbers for me!
---
The metas, which are required for map completion, are an hour apart... and there's no real reason to stick around after map completion.
---
I'll never bend the knee to a Dark Elf you traitor.
---
Casul
---
I don't get much of a "loop" feel.  I've got two completions and two near-completions done and just can't get a pleasant rhythm down to exploring the map.
---
Except, you know, the being that is now linked to her through becoming her dragon minion confirmed her being dead. Also her flowers wilted into dust. 
---
That doesn't mean it's not possible for her to come back. But she's dead.
---
And I know this was a joke.
---
“Would you settle down and have another cup of coffee?”
---
I appreciate your service
---
It was that way for Lyssa. Eventually Anet just gave up at all the reports they were getting from people who were butt hurt because other players were toxic toward them for not letting Lyssa fail.. so Anet fixed it so you get credit regardless if it fails or not.   So I kinda thought they learned their lesson.
---
Okay, good, I'm not crazy. I kept seeing this happen on both maps and had no idea if I was supposed to do something during the countdown to actually start the event.
---
Looks kinda like Aurene blasted off the right side of his head too though.  That horn or ear or whatever it was appears to be missing.  Also some of his teeth on the right side and that half of his face are covered in blue Aurene brand.  He's gonna need to see a plastic surgeon about this.
---
I just crafted the ascended sword, didn't get a collection for it. 
---
As a map experience... I've got almost none of the achievements and I already feel like I'm done with it.  Sandswept and Jahai were both really fun to poke around, but the design of Thunderhead feels like a forced grind.  Two mets an hour apart with not much to do in between, to get two pieces of a key you can use to open a puzzle to ding POIs to complete the map... but only once per day per account.
---
Timegating altcoholics for the first time in the development of the game feels pretty harsh - harsher still in that I was still finding new and neat things to do on my third and fourth completion in Jahai, while on my second time through Thunderhead it looked like I'd already seen everything.  A fact reinforced on my third and fourth trips - alts now left at the bottom of the stairs to access the puzzle later in the week.
---
Or dental procedures. Thats anyway how I feel while doing Dragons Stand meta.
---
"now spit" 
---
Hmm I could not find any usage of this mastery, maybe I am just missing its purpose. Can anyone explain a few possible combos to me please? :)
---
i tought Canach was a bland and boring character to add to the commander's party, i could never be so wrong.
---
Even very early in the morning, where only very few peeps had been on the map I had been in, this "situation" generated quite a bit of a stir in map chat.
---
Real bummer for the whole map population, even if not directly involved, as it just generates toxic vibes. 
---
When you're doing the Mouth of Mordremoth and you griffon up and then remember toy can't use updrafts or ley lines
---
Some story dialogues do not play their respective voice lines, leaving only voiceless speech bubbles. That affects not only Ep5 story, but also any other story you can replay (Was helping a friend with PoF prologue and experience these problems that weren't around on my first playthrough)
---
Agreed.  We need Blish back.
---
This would make a lot of sense. My first thought at the end was that it seemed odd to make a brief point of Aurene being able to speak through Caithe which is kind of a big deal and then not touch on it again. But Aurene being encased in her own magic and using Caithe to tell us how to get her out would be a good way to start season 5. 
---
For me I mix it up between open world metas, raids, &amp; fractals.  Occasionally dungeons.  I just play what I feel like when I think it sounds like a fun way to spend a few hours.  I even do map completion for fun from time to time.
---
Having friends/a guild to chat with is also generally a boon to keeping me in game as well, but it's not 100% necessary.
---
I expect to see it being used on Pvp Boonbeast and Danger Chrono.
---
Based on the hordes of branded Awakened we fight, I don't think that would solve much. 
---
Sould not a more people, be able to scale the event up and not do it. Making it impossible for few or even bunch of trolls/unaware people to complete it? Matriarch from hot vb for example would fail a lot, back in a day.
---
&gt; So to break even, if you want to move from using Silver to buying Runecrafter's, you'll have to make 225'54'00c/64c= ~35'240 salvages.
---
So basically a few runs through SW opening chests.
---
My sister's 10th birthday :D Thanks for sharing. 
---
Yesterday was already Stage 1: Shock
---
Today is stage 2: Denial
---
I don't think anyone really thinks Aurene is truly gone, there is definitely something else going considering Glint's private talk with Aurene and all the cryptic dialogue to us. Like you said, no way they'd spend 2 expansions and 3 LW seasons to build her up just to have her die in 1 blow. 
---
PMed. I'll hook you up. 
---
That was the first place I went afterwards too. Made the mistake of talking to Taimi who asked if I thought Aurene was going to be ok.  *cries*
---
I am currently feeling this pain.  Between the wood and the daily gated stuff it's taking me forever.
---
&gt; "uh, you and I both know that's not true"
---
On the tall part at least. Considering for a Human body there is an average of 57-60% water (so most than half), I'd say that if proportions are respected even for an Asura, we're technically a glass of water anyway. Just not a tall one.
---
In her visions and in this episode there is a crystal spear going straight up her neck and jaw, that seems like a little more than branding to me.
---
Related, the plate only seems to drop if you kite the graveling away from his spawn point. If he dies on top of it, you can't get the plate.
---
That's the alter to our gods at Arena-Net. Often, late on monday evenings you'll see them sacrifice poor asuran souls to sustain their bloodlust... and to hope for a bug free patch day.
---
"I would consult the pale tree." Well, you walked right into that one and now he's gotcha.
---
I'm pissed about it right now but if they really kill her off just like that? I'd be.... (echoed heroic voice) SUPER PISSED!
---
It saddens me I'm so many years removed from the game that I wouldn't even know what to do if I had a Dev to raid with. 
---
Just give it time. Eventually people will lose interest and move on. 
---
*Bagel flashbacks*
---
Very nice!
---
Yeah it’s pretty weird I finished the episode and none of the stars are showing up in the map or durmond priory.
---
Think I’m just bugged and gonna do the episode again. 
---
Regarding the whole Aurene-coming-back... *thing*, I will concede that her somehow using Joko's powers to resurrect herself would be an... *acceptable* solution to the corner they've written themselves into, although if it just sort of *happens* I will be *wildly* disappointed - at least make us put some effort into it, give it the proper emotional impact. I will, at the very least, resist the urge to rain too much more vitriol than entirely necessary down on them until the arc has been fully resolved, just in case they manage to bring it to a satisfying conclusion without having to resort to a full-on Deus Ex Machina (if you haven't guessed by this point, I'm feeling a bit miffed with some of the narrative choices that were made for this episode) and they can somehow make properly finishing off Kralky even *more* climactic than our most recent battle (which was, in fairness, pretty spectacular, even with the weird camera bug at the end). I do not, frankly, have the highest of expectations at this point; I just hope we don't have to wait another three months to find out.
---
On that note, ideally they'll be able to get Episode 6 out some time mid-March, so they don't have to delay it until after the Super Adventure Festival. An early May release, while a lovely birthday preasent, would also be entirely too long of a wait for a cliffhanger of this magnitude. Beyond that, I would be absolutely ecstatic if they could manage a release of the quality and scope of S4 every two months for S5, but more practically speaking I'll settle for them actually meeting their standing 2-3 month deadline for at least, like, half the episodes. In terms of the plot direction, I'd honestly prefer it if they dialed the tension down a bit - the stakes have been raised pretty much every episode since HoT launched, and frankly if they try to squeeze any more out at this point it's going to start breaking people's immersion. Give us a breather for at least half an episode, focus on some B-plots for a while, and lead us into the next looming Armageddon a bit later in the season. I'm reasonably sure they'll lead into the next expansion after S5 - they've never said they're stopping expansion development entirely, after all, and unless they start making the cash shop a *lot* less player-friendly they're going to need the cash injection eventually - but it's not inconceivable that they would go as far as S6 before an expansion if they're feeling confident in their business model, particularly if they release something big like new Elite Specializations with S5.
---
I'm sure we'll end up dealing with the rest of the Elder Dragons eventually, although once Kralky is relieved of his *other* eye (with the greatest prejudice possible, if I have may way) the remaining three probably won't be immediate threats, seeing as two are at least temporarily dormant and the third is still basically a non-entity. Until we pick up the main plot again, I'm betting that we'll be headed in the direction of the Charr homelands, or possibly the Far Shiverpeaks for some new Norn/Svarnir development. My personal dark horse is going to Cantha, which could tie nicely into going after the Deep Sea Dragon (which would make sense to me as our next focus, seeing as it's the only one that is technically an active threat at the moment), but seeing as PoF and LWS3/4 were all fairly Human-centric I think a change of species would be entirely reasonable. We could, in theory, go into the Depths to pursue some Asura-related stuff, but if I'm remembering my lore correctly that would throw us into conflict with Destroyers pretty much instantly and, on the technical side, would present some logistical issues in terms of how the maps would fit into the existing game world. So, in conclusion, lots of interesting possibilities to explore, and no doubt many exciting adventures ahead of us - here's hoping they can wrap this one up without it blowing up in their faces. Also this comment seems to have turned into somewhat more of a venting than originally intended, so, ah, sorry about that.
---
I’ve just started playing as this.  Loving it.
---
Everyone else wears leather armor. (Or silk.)
---
Yeah. I really enjoyed that collections told the weapon's story. It caused immersion and actual feel that its a legendary weapon and not an another skin.
---
So lame that they only require materials now.
---
Whenever I quest I skip all things in all mmos. Gw2 forces me not to. 
---
I don't like that. I just want rewards. Care not for the story. 
---
You can go to Lion’s Arch through the PvP map and access the starting zones of other races if you want to train in lower level zones, which really doesn’t matter because scaling exists.
---
Oh I loved HoT as well, I just think for the general players it needed some sort of buildup to teach them how to play that content. And 1-80 don't. 
---
I still don't get why all the jumping puzzles in the game weren't converted to adventures... it would allow them to give slightly better rewards, have JP leaderboards and stop mesmer and ability cheese from effecting those times. 
---
That’s where we play “Guild Darts”!
---
As peeved as I am over how they decided to progress the plot in the end, I have to agree - the fight with Kralky was pretty spectacular. I just hope that finishing him off *properly* doesn't end up feeling anticlimactic by comparison.
---
I am following your instructions and they are perfect so far. I am doing the focus and I got Chasing Tales: Storm's Eye. I have to Defeat the temporal storm elemental in Thunderhead Peaks while wielding a focus. Anyone know where I can find the temporal storm elemental? 
---
One of the "GW2 way of doing things" have been creating no competition between players over things like nodes, events, rewards etc. so breaking it now leaves an even worse taste. I really do not know why they are still trying to tie achievements to failing events. For the legendary quest ones, it just created extra work for them as they had to check most of those events to fix so causing the same problem both for developers and players again is mind boggling
---
It’s very telling about the 3 different teams and the priorities they have. It seems like Team 1 is set on delivering active maps that feel full of life and activity to bolster the story and Team 2 and 3 either lack motivation or creativity. Or both. Or, maybe they just don’t feel a connection to the game. 
---
I think he meant because Dredge are blind. I'm going to assume that he smells you or something and guesses your race correctly.
---
^^^^5
---
I didn't make smart use of mechanics and got gold easily.
---
Inb4 dev abuse ;)
---
Was it? I couldn't make out the images super well.
---
Jesus dude, did you fill your 2019 raiding schedule in this thread? 
---
Get some food for exp boost ^^
---
"Suicide Area"
---
Maybe they are trying to limit the amount of playability for some maps so that the population is not divided equally per map but rather concentrated in specific ones.
---
My main is human commoner and I found this dialogue today. The anti-capitalist implications made me smile. I'm glad they put this in the game for Dredge. I rather enjoy dialogue that makes me pay attention and isn't just some superfluous text. I wish there were more NPCs in the game like this.
---
Power Herald might be able to make good use of it
---
Gotcha. Still seems like a niche complaint. In a couple of days the wiki or Dulfy will be updated and you can look at what you need. I mean I haven't even started the weapons yet, I'm still exploring the zone. I've done the story on a couple of different characters. I love the dwarven catacombs area.  The metas aren't bad.  In general I'm having fun.
---
One thing you have to know is that you'll need the branded masses, which is the zone currency. You can start collecting that at any time.
---
I also want to point out I love the new mastery that comes with this zone.
---
I remember at launch when dredge mobs were immune to blind, but then they took that out.
---
This doesn't necessarily work if you're a free to play player. Free to play players can't access LA till level 35. What does work, now is that all starter waypoints for all 1-15 zones are unlocked when you created a character, so you can waypoint to every starting zone directly. Just thought I should add that.
---
 Or maybe join as invisible 11th man and check if it still triggers.
---
Engis have no shouts
---
I've got several lvl 80 ( ele, mesmer, thief, warrior and ranger) and I have no idea who to play. I've played lots of ele before but I want to have a second best character to play around with and I'm not sure who to pick.
---
this, too, was the first thing i thought off when i read the new mastery.
---
I never said that Gold wouldnt be possible by other means. I did it myself with rather chill speed and got gold. I just noted towards the OPs methods.
---
This definitely was not my experience. Make sure you're doing things like map completion, vistas, points of interest, and hero points as well as events you find. Every starter zone is paced pretty well to where, provided you're actually exploring, doing events, and the content as it was meant to be played, broken up by personal story instances, it's very difficult to have heart quests not keep pace with your progress. And this goes without saying, but generally you wanna stay in the same map if you're looking to get a consistently paced experience.
---
Fair enough. I just hope the map will be kept busy for a while and doesn't become a ghost town.
---
Super Adventure Box. It's an april's fools platforming-like minigame which has different levels of difficulty and various worlds. There are 2 of those, and people have been waiting for worlds 3 and 4 to come out for ages now.
---
OH SHIT I NEED THIS
---
I didn't dance, but I walked all over that thing before realizing what I was standing on.
---
Dry Top &amp; Silverwastes are lv 80 maps so make sure that you're appropriately leveled for those areas or you will have a tough time, especially without mounts.
---
Kralk's dragon balls?
---
stupid baubles too
---
I mean, he is totally correct, any culture that allows a group of small Josef Mengeles have much to learn
---
Nah, this is pretty much a typical week for me. Raid raid raid raid raid.
---
Do Not reccomend Chaos on mirage anymore this trait variant is as dead as power reaper. 
---
Yeah. But it doesn’t fit in the timeline for her to obtain so much info in so little time... she may not have met him at all actually. Trahearne was so busy preparing for the Mordemoth fight and had vanished by end of LW2.
---
Taimi: Are you going to see Marshal Trahearne? You're friends, right? I'd love to tell my classmates that I met him.
---
PC: I'm sorry, Taimi. Things are too serious right now. Some other time.
---
Taimi: Okay, I understand. 
---
The dialogue in the previous episode should’ve been reversed, woulda made more sense that the commander had known those details about him, instead of Taimi. 
---
The Commander’s final words to Trahearne in LW2 were: “Be safe. We'll share a drink and stories when we meet again.”  ;(
---
Lots of dialogue is LW2 suggested that they were quite close - spent much time together talking and telling stories. 
---
Rox said “I figured you'd be in there for hours with Marshal Trahearne, catching up on old times.” Commander replies, “It wasn’t that kind of a visit”. 
---
One my favorites - Commander says, “I’ve been away”. Trahearne replies, “I had noticed”. 
---
Can we have similar achievements for other companies 
---
* Google, 
---
* Intel and/or AMD
---
* BMW
---
will see
---
I'm willing to pay 100G for Aurene to come back *please*
---
Have you started the latest LS episode? Sometimes they don't unlock until you start. 
---
My left-field theory is that she doesn't get resurrected, but stays dead... albeit still in the mists.
---
And then we realize that with her gone, replacing Kralkatorrik by killing and absorbing him is no longer an option. We need to do what we did in Flashpoint and find his opposite (Bubbles) to pacify him. That would be enough of an excuse to justify a completely different season.
---
That's hilarious. 
---
This was exactly my experience, I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one!
---
Soon they'll be holding hands. 
---
Well if you don't show us anything to compare with, we can't really answer. Wiki images should be enough for you to compare.
---
Can say for a fact that my Charr Engineer and my Charr Revenant are the same as before.
---
&gt; Free to play players can't access LA till level 35.
---
Technically they can with a help of HOT owned guild: ask someone to open a guild portal to LA, follow the light ^(^(I am controller of Planet X. And I've invited you here))
---
Again, it's irrelevant what gear my toons use. They are level 80s, they are perfectly capable of being in the area, and considering the area itself is a level 80 area I would say that we agree they do belong there ;D
---
Where did I say you were being elite? I don't believe I did, nor did I imply it.
---
I'm aware it's end game content, but map completion has always been something you could do regardless of events. That's the part that you seem to be missing.
---
I'd suggest seeking an anger management course.
---
Love it! 
---
Whatever works. But probably steve is gonna use his balls for aurene.
---
Yes okay, that's true. Doesn't really change what I said. If the free to play -player is trying to follow the instructions of that guy and he doesn't have a character high enough level to enter LA, he very well might not be in a guild or know that. I just think teleporting directly would be smarter than bothering the guild to open a portal to LA anyway.
---
Oh i never raided so far, would totally sign up to be carried by a Anet dev. :3 
---
"Need" to do that sometime anyway to get all masteries. :D
---
&gt;I take issue with this. I was a sysadmin on the east coast in that year, and while "devops" wasn't the buzzword concept it is today as evidenced by my still being a "sysop" instead of "devops engineer", the processes are all isomorphic. 
---
Ok, first and foremost. DevOps is **not** about a title, role, technology, etc. It's about culture, specifically people and being empathetic. It's about an organization being on the same page for how they architect, develop, run, sell, and market their products. And DevOps is very org-specific. It's open-ended. It's a set of high level values that are used to create internal processes, tools, etc. It's also about creating feedback loops at every level so that teams (people) can make more informed decisions about where the product needs to go. This is why CI/CD, containers, K8S, Prometheus, etc are such a big thing in that world... not because they ARE DevOps (you can do DevOps without those), but because they help create those feedback loops.
---
&gt;We used piles of puppet/nagios back then (which with a thin amount of glue code and/or VCS hooks was easily as powerful as CI pipes nowdays if not as shiny), and Xen/KVM were in vogue instead of Docker, and often treated physical clusters via IPMI as a k8s cluster might look nowadays, in terms of creating umbrella infra to manage scalability and transparent deployment. Tech has not changed so much that these learnings are novel, in any respect.
---
See my points above, the technology doesn't make DevOps or not. You very well could be doing DevOps now, I don't know. My only point (something we push hard for in the DevOps community) is that each company's needs and challenges are different. So for you or I to say that "ANet needs to do it X way" is ridiculous. We don't know what tech debt, culture, requirements, infrastructure, etc they have.
---
My main point this entire thread is to simply have some empathy. ESPECIALLY if you've worked in Admin or Dev. The idea that "X amount of testing will catch all bugs" is ridiculous. I've seen tests - MANUAL AND AUTOMATED BOTH - pass in a dev or staging environment, then do something completely unexpected once put in production with a production load..... so have some empathy for the ANet devs.
---
My friend literally deleted his account after finishing this chapter.  He's a bit dramatic sometimes.  
---
Changing what you said was not my intention, i don't think i did.
---
Maybe you're right and maybe you're just over-generalizing, but that hasn't been my experience. In fact, the worst experiences and decisions I've seen made at my job were at larger, more well established orgs that ignored facts constantly because mgmt wanted to do something "their way"...... and continued to do so not only after being warned that it wouldn't work, but even after watching it fail before their eyes.
---
Scent, probably, Canach was described as smelling like fresh-cut grass (before his current cactus-inspired look).
---
It is already automatic the moment you click salvage all, so why do you want to put even more automated options... 
---
It's pretty effective. You just shout at people to GET OUT OF THE DAMN FIRE and usually that keeps them alive for a little longer.
---
Whenever you get to a heart, prioritize events around it, add the packs of lonely mobs whenever you can. If after all that heart is still not complete do specific stuff required. Gonna reach 30 in no time.
---
* As others mentioned, you can go to other low level zones to catch up on xp, but hearts are not main source of it.
---
* From 30, do a path of a dungeon, gives around level and a bit more, 2-3 story modes will let you do explore modes - mix that with your leveling routine 
---
About?
---
Lionguard 1: What you do think? 8.5?
---
Lionguard 2: 7.8. Nice accuracy on the dive but the landing was limp.
---
Hmm...by my count the only statues I have that you don't are the four hard mode areas and the luxon one. Thing is, I'm at 44/40 statues in Honor, so either you're missing something elsewhere or you'll be at 50/50 just by grabbing the Luxon statue.
---
As much as I love her and don't want to let her go, I really do want this to be real. I want them to find another way, as unlikely as it is. I want this to have an effect on the commander and the people that trust them. I want to hear my commander really grapple with the loss, be angry and depressed and make more mistakes because of it and eventually, many episodes in the future, learn to accept it.
---
shrine?
---
actually, can't compare with wiki either, characters shape may change and the "big shoulder" issue was a lot related to the shape chosen on creation.
---
i'm asking for this reason, i have this feeling and want some confirmation.
---
can confirm about some better effect on legendary armors and backpack interations tho, also shields.
---
I had all backpacks on medium characters hidden after crafting legendary medium coat, today i checked and most of the backpacks now are closer to the armor, so yeah, i guess we got a stealth fix on characters look
---
"Son-of-a-Skritt"
---
mode?
---
I actually like this! What if everything Glint has done has been to ensure Kralkatorrik’s survival? What if she never intended to help us but was actually working against us behind the scenes? Now that would be a good twist!
---
You did not answer my question though?
---
Small correction: it was Ogden who said that
---
Encased in her own crystal? She was impaled
---
&gt; My dps has increased.
---
Somehow I doubt this is connected to the controller you use.
---
Answering with another question
---
Apparently not a guide dog because this isn't dyejobs &lt;3
---
How is "They will make their way in to the wallet at some point in the future." the same as "shortly after the Festival of the Four Winds"?
---
I think I randomly found it yesterday. After the North meta I found a fire elemental looking minion called temporal elemental or something (my game isn't in english). Seemed like a veteran. 
---
Is there a way to quickly loot all the chests on top of the minimap all at once?
---
I feel the same way about the power gap in the sense that there isn't a logical alternative outside of going all the way to Cantha and convincing a Saltspray Dragon to go along with our crazy plan that's failed twice already with the last two dragons.  
---
It seems like every part of the build up is intended to instill doubt in both directions.
---
I think my biggest mental factor is that it would be my luck to put that much emotional investment into that adorable little shit, and she stays dead.
---
I'm not sure I agree that Joko's magic should be discounted because it's not dragon magic. It's still magic, and how dragon magic mixes or matches against it is not clear, since they were able to call upon and clearly utilize Balthazar's magic, which is that of a human god.
---
There are a lot of bizarre cues throughout this episode and the previous ones that are unclear.
---
Other things that are unclear to me:
---
* How much did we actually injure Kralkatorik, and will this be used as a method of depowering his more immediate threat level.
---
* Was Kralkatorik threatened enough that he actually couldn't have just finished us there. Surely he's powerful enough to sense that we're not dead. Some people speculate that Aurene could have taken over his body, which I think sounds neat, but is highly unlikely. 
---
* There's always some kind of follow up on the end of chapters/episodes where we review the perspectives of the cast, and its unclear if the lack of this is to indicate that there isn't so much finality to this, or that the common perspective of despair should be very clear.
---
* What the significance of breaking off Kralkatorik's eye will mean for us.
---
* Why Aurene didn't detonate into a gigantic explosion of energy to be absorbed by Kralky.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced heroes of different classes there that can guide you to the right direction.
---
The fact that you have recipe books for Exotic "regular" Diviner weapons, Dragonsblood Exotic weapon and Ascended "regular" Diviner weapons will probably confus the heck out of some people and will cause trouble especially since the drop rate of Serpentine Jewels seem very low or very time gated (that or I just have a very bad RNG which is also very possible).
---
 New player and all, i have a good idea of what classes i want to play  and level at my own pace but i want to boost a character to lvl 80 so i  can start playing and seeing some lvl 80 content in preparation for when  my other classes get to lvl 80. What class is best as being solo in the  open world and doing quests? 
---
ANet killing off Aurene
---
stop farming, you can do various content a day, the stuff you like and still have income. first make a list of what you like. 
---
* See what fits daily rewards - so for example you don't go vista for daily, but when you do your fav vista it happens to be a daily; and that's your 2 gold. 
---
* Do 1 run of AB, and mix with hero points to help others out?
---
* Do pvp (some rew tracks also give blc chest keys)
---
* Do fractals (does not have to be t4, if you like to help others for example)
---
* 8 dungeon paths can be done in 20 min, if organized well, and that's your 5+ gold
---
Or maybe not try to perfectly match both things when they are only a parallel in some respects?
---
That's not an answer though.
---
So far:
---
1) Bounties removed in flavor of champ spawns - **Good**
---
This is good imo, hardly anyone actually did Bounties and even with daily bounty at Jahai there was no one doing them. More old-school way to spawn champs
---
2) No race - **but why?**
---
Seems same as Bounties. Guess too little people did it to make it worth putting checkpoints in circle? No one does them so we it it slide
---
3) 2 "metas" - **Mediocre**
---
North is just "lot of mobs, just aoe and try not to die while getting max loot"-hard. Boss at end is pretty cool tho. And I like the new oneshotting mechanic of dark red circles.
---
South is just defense to kill regular mobs. Only thing hard is to make people spread. Of people listen it's just lootfest as usual.
---
 Boss at end seems lacking on mechanics unless you are strict melee char.
---
4) Catacombs Chambers - **Bugged or rng?**
---
I only got 3 plates when I did it. Apparently you need to kill the skelk thing multiple times and hope for plate to drop? Oh ok. Also the light "searching for chest" was bit confusing.
---
5) MUST..DIG..THROUGH..PAIN - **Basic as event can be**
---
It's just waves of hard hitting mobs from last map.
---
6) Atmosphere and music - 9/10
---
Same here! Always when I think I'm in the clear Aurene uses her power blast and kills everything, ticking the crystal. 
---
&gt; This game has to be played with a controller!
---
Why? I would have to buy and learn to use a new type of controller that very likely has fewer buttons than my current setup (keyboard+mouse).
---
If anything I do get that you might feel more immersed with a game controller because you might be able to keep your eyes more on the screen than your hands. But that really depends on how well you can use your keyboard and mouse. If you have to look down to your keyboard while you play (for the most used things to press), you have to work on your keybindings - and you will feel just as immersed. Then the difference in immersion just comes from your own skill using the respective input device.
---
I'm sure I can get my static to do a boss or wing with you if you want. We're on EU and raid usually Monday / Wednesday 7:30 PM CET. 
---
This is definitely the kind of motivation players need to get introduced into raiding!
---
Truthfully these optimized meta builds are only for minimizing clear time. You can do fractals with pretty much any build imaginable. Raids have enrage timer, so optimization is more crucial there. Regardless, DPS Chrono is totally viable anyway, just depends how you want to play the class.
---
I suppose they smell different? 
---
For raids you pack very little boon duration on gear outside or rune/sigils now so yeah you're gonna have a bit maybe but not much. For fractals it's kinda nice, I tried a random setup right after patch with Legendary Armor in diviner + Leadership + Rest zerk + Concnetration Sigil and you get ~80% boon duration without food (but with pots ofc) so it's good enough imo.
---
"Ok, first and foremost. DevOps is not about a title, role, technology, etc. It's about culture, specifically people and being empathetic."
---
I'm not even going to argue it at this point, devops has been so mangled as a term that it's like arguing about "OOP" vs "functional programming".  From a pragmatic standpoint, there is nothing we are doing now under the label of "Devops" that was not done before, even under the somewhat fluffy definition you gave that I read primarily as "have good communcation, don't silo your orgs and throw shit over walls" which is just _good business sense._  I brought up the technology only to draw parallels between any "non-organizational" aspects of devops I could think of offhand.
---
You've also put words in my mouth with "anet needs to do it X way."  I criticized your initial posts insinuations re: startups and the impossibility of a test env, and I stand by that.  Anet does not have a fantastic track record in terms of not releasing _really painful_ bugs to prod.  There's really no room for interpretation there, they pay a lot of attention to some aspects of their releases and clearly less to others.  I did not proscribe a given method or claim it would catch all bugs, but I will assert that these common methods _should not_ be prohibitive in a well functioning org, nor should perfection in any way be the enemy of better.
---
Let me emphasize clearly:  I have also _never_ criticized the devs themselves in this thread, only outcomes, in the same way I would critique my own org's outcomes at work.  I have been at various points QA, Perf, test and support, so I'm well aware of "thankless jobs."  My point is only to hammer in that there are aspects of improved quality assurance that for whatever organizational reason or decision Anet has not had a good track record of utilizing.  
---
I'd even go so far to say, from having been a dev on teams that made similar prioritizations (towards features and away from QA/engineering rigor), I was often _relieved_ and vindicated to hear external users pressuring the company to focus on these facets.  I honestly chuckled out loud while typing this because of how ironic it is to say in the context of gaming subreddits (who often complain that the company doesn't listen to them) because _no one_ is ignored quite like a dev.
---
As long as I can set a mix of gemstore kits and mystic/black lion kits, I would really like this implemented.
---
I prefer boon chrono because I enjoyed playing the utility role back in the days of the 1 mesmer 4 warrior meta.
---
FelsEUMan
---
Canach is fantastic. 
---
Same. I just log in for dailies but I'm fine with that. No sub cost.
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
You can apparently only drop 7 puddles before they start to despawn.  Going through the fence is a lot less puddles.
---
He didn't even say anything to me when I brought him water on my male sylvari.  
---
I'm going to let him die of thirst in the future.
---
High = ascended
---
did you disable ArcDPS? 
---
Are part of \[Not Fun at paarties\]? :P
---
When you go into HoT maps, remember this: everything and everyone will try to kill you...
---
Enjoy!
---
Another achievement which is. Impossible in eu. 
---
Pretty sure that's actually a polymock arena. They really need to bring it already, that poor asuran has been working on the portal for 7 years! 
---
Ooh. Like the rabbit you follow in eye of the North? 
---
&gt; daylies and farctal dailiies
---
That is a good start. What you should have told us though is what is usually the thing holding you back. Money? Collections? Account-bound materials? Gifts of Battle? Depending on that you should change your schedule.
---
I would think with a routine like yours money shouldn't be the issue. If materials is often an issue, do visit a few of the permanent/semipermanent rich nodes each day. If it's those account-bound mats: do the metas now and then. WvW dailies are the best for casual gifts of battle. There is no way around the collections, but you can take them slowly.
---
Radiance is a cheap alternative to leadership but you do little less damage. 
---
should you go around purple stuff?
---
I decided to work towards HOPE over Christmas and these style of achievements for the Infinity Coil or Gates of Arah are utterly awful. I don't like trying to spam join maps during world events or checking the game super early in the morning in the hope (intended) of the mob I need to kill to be up.
---
Anet really should have realised by now that designs like this aren't fun. It seems to happen with pretty much every story release. 
---
This bug is no bug, you just didn't solve the puzzle.
---
I'm all for above water spears. 
---
&gt; They are level 80s, they are perfectly capable of being in the area, and considering the area itself is a level 80 area
---
GW2 max level is 80 that doesn't mean the maps will continue to stay as easy as core 80 areas. You need to gear up your characters now. Maybe not fully acsended but you just cant expect to rush 70 tome boosted toons (that what that sounded like) through an area where the devs seriously expect characters to have at least some acsended stuff. Not fully, but some and no green/blue. And I understand that you guys do not want to wait for other players either, but this also counts toward progression in end game content. You need to play - multiplayer in an mmo in fact - to progress some times so deal with it.
---
There is a reason - and you can thank arenanet for that - that you do not need end game maps for 100% map completion, because you can't and the devs are not designing those maps to be rushed.
---
Completing an end game map is awesome and I congratulate you if you have set yourself that goal, but I can tell you if you want to rush something it's the wrong goal set, especially with 70 tome boosted toons. It's just not anets fault at this point.
---
I am angry because this is common sense. The devs do not have to cater to your kind after 9001 maps further down the core Tyrian easy as fuck 80 maps where you could just skip content with every toon that weren't even 80 gear equipped.
---
Play with the people, but don't expect to rush these maps with your toons. In my head 70 toons are insane anyway.
---
At that point we were seeing her memories of her past self.  
---
Since then she aquired more knowledge especially if she was still able to see her gift in the mists.  
---
  
---
Based on how Glint was reacting to us through the episode (when we died, she told us it's not our time to die yet, talked to us, talked to aurene, ect. ) it's safe to say that what we interact with wasn't just a recorded occurance but Glint from today with knowledge and visions accumulated after her death.  
---
Ogden at that point also mentioned that he's due for a visit, implying that he was visiting Glint one way or another in the past too - hence the knowledge about the updated prophecy.
---
Theres been like 3 threats no? 
---
If they did an awakened playable race they'd need a really good solution to the 1-80 leveling process since an awakened player character would only really be possible after joko's death; you can't be the pact commander in the original personal story if you're mind controlled by joko. Tbh it wouldn't work at all cause if you were awakened you couldn't have taken part in any of the expansion or living story pre-joko.. so it'll prob never happen unless they shoehorn in some free awakened faction that existed while joko was still alive
---
How is it now? 5 months later have you tried the entire story (if you still play)? Asking because I just started a noble human.
---
I always preferred [this interpretation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EscOE4sSYOo)
---
This. Just learn shorten paths to reach fire.
---
Just play Thinking Man's Scourge aka Support Scourge, it makes even the most unskilled players look amazing at support, like me 😂
---
&gt; I can't even take a joyride on my raptor with out getting blown up by some thing
---
It's the jungle, and not a nice one. What do you expect? You are at war there, with that jungle.
---
&gt; getting ambushed by tiny raptors
---
The usual mistake with them is to try to run away. Hit them, and they will die fast. Try to run, and you will die.
---
&gt; getting poisoned by THE AIR!
---
Get the mastery and that won't be a problem anymore.
---
And maybe, to get the real feel for those maps: don't use mounts.
---
An elder dragon just ate the mists bro
---
Just the first? Finish the whole story chapter, then hit "Replay for Achievements" 
---
Its so cute how you attempt to spare the fence :D
---
Besides what people said, death in GW2 seemed strange to me in the first place. Kralk killed Glint several years ago and she has existed in the Mists ever since then. Once Kralk was able to go into the Mists they continued their fight. Aurene was just killed so shouldn't she be in the Mists as well?
---
i was able to see home node but people arent.Then they fix it so you should not talk sir.
---
tried that too,i love casuals in this game you know so much about everything but have no success in this game funny guys.Keep downvoting this.
---
If you're not tanking in raids you don't need the survivability. And even with that, tanks mostly take toughness for the aggro mechanic, less for the damage mitigation. If you want the survivability, you can play any build you want and it'll probably be fine, but meta builds are always going to leave survivability out if there is higher damage potential, because the meta is focused on speed clears.
---
Might have been stealth tuned with the most recent patch. I got it first try, and I swear that fish was half in half out. 
---
Well... we will see in the next episode! (Now that I think about it it feels like some tv show) 
---
DragonHunter, you can easily solo most of HOT HeroPoints, with core guardian as well.
---
Other might say Reaper, which i also agree to.
---
Maybe she farmed enough HP in kralks lair to dual specc?
---
I think the FB/Ren comp is probably better/safer for CMs but for some regular factals that are a bit more events/trash and a bit less boss oriented Chrono will probably work a bit better (so for example chrono might be better for Cliffside/Aetheblae but FB/Ren might be nicer for Mei Trin). But in any case those are the regular T4 and any variant will do the trick.
---
There will also be some difference between setting up a group in full pug and setitng up a group with friends/guildies.
---
And if you're holding a crystal for the final laser beam it's automatically thrown
---
This isn't a bug. You only get so much oil out of a barrel.
---
The way to win this is to lead it to the fence, run around the fence, and continue the oil spill.
---
With the exception of calling Kralkatorrik's branded (as that term was made after Glint's death), every bit of wording was ambiguous enough that they could have been pre-recorded into memory crystals. She never used Aurene's name iirc, nor the title Commander, only scion and champion. She never talked about current events either, or post-mortem events, like Kralkatorrik's new power grabs with Zhaitan's, Mordremoth's, and Balthazar's deaths or his foray into the Mists.
---
Ogden's line about being due a visit I took as the Champion (aka commander) visiting him.
---
&gt; The boss "mechanics" present in the keep lords on the desert borderlands drive me nuts. I don't want a bunch of complex CC and other bullshit messing with me while I'm trying to focus on enemy players. 
---
So what you are saying is that the complexity of a really simple boss is too high for you, but on the other hand you can deal with tens of enemy players easily?
---
For me it's usually the other way around. All those lords aren't too difficult at all. Their skills are announced pretty visibly, and you know exactly what they will do beforehand: not a problem. A group of enemy players: not so much.
---
So we're casuals but if you couldn't do this part without breaking down and sobbing on reddit, what are you now? 
---
Just go through the fence. 
---
This “bug” isn’t a bug it’s a feature. 
---
Ah so that's Captain Weyandt!
---
Iirc dredge are not to 100% blind.
---
i got that event today and tagged 7 crystals and got 0/10 ... apparently you have to LAST HIT the crystal to get it actually....
---
anet.. you gotta be kidding.
---
I think it is not random that they have showed us a dragon minion awakened now - out of all other episodes.  
---
I believe it's foreshadowing of Jokos magic being applied onto Aurene. Technically a minion from Kralkatorrik
---
Players in T1 &amp; T2 tend to have a common problem.  
---
They often blame their struggles on lack of a healer.  They don't look to their allies -- or even to themselves for the necessary support skills.  If even 2-3 players in a 5 person group swapped out a DPS utility for a support utility most common problems could be avoided.  
---
There are reasons that you go into Fractals with a strategy, and brute forcing content isn't a strategy inexperienced players should adopt.  It's something for experienced players to consider a [risk vs. reward] scenario.  You can't emulate speedclear strats in a T1/T2 pug group.  You have to learn to respect the content and take powerful utility or trait skills for damage mitigation and support.  
---
Whether it's condi-cleanses, reflects, projectile destruction, stability, condition-transfers, boon-corrupt or condition conversion the game gives all classes tools to succeed.  It's up to players to respect the content and *themselves* enough to not blame their problems on others and be willing to engage in trial, experimentation, error, repetition and practice. 
---
Knowing the better strategies and being able to directly influence the outcome of instanced PvE is what makes a good player. 
---
Yeah.. but in this case it isn't actually a bug. It is a feature, that require you to plan and think a bit. There seem to be an actual bug connected to it though, but that shouldn't effect you in that clip, since it requires others to be there to override your puddles. And while there is indeed someone else in the clip, you would fail anyway, since you are not doing it right and thus won't have enough puddles to actually complete it. 
---
All (F)or Nothing..
---
That's how mafia works.
---
Confirmed minionmancer buff inc next patch!!!
---
do the first mission of the respective story, like you did on your main...
---
ye very politely mister casual number 2
---
Come on
---
tried fence to mr genius
---
It's not a bug.  Your strategy just sucks.  You can pour oil and connect it through the fence.  You're also not getting enough value out of each oil pour they *barely* need to connect.  So long as you maximize the value of each oil (and make sure it's on the tank) you can just path through the fence and complete it in 2-3 attempts. 
---
It is always wonderful to hear how someone was inspired by a story!
---
However, I would caution on how you translate that inspiration to your personal work. Games, movies, series, anime, manga, books etc. deliver their narrative in different ways and you can have identical plot points fall flat or succeed depending on the presentation in the medium of choice.
---
All that aside tho, I wish you the best of luck with your writing!
---
Yes thats True... however on the Next Step ist better to have kess Players since you basicly compete afaik at each other who gets the Count for Doing it
---
Fire goes through fences. Just think or ask your guildmates for help before you rage on reddit.
---
If this was such a major bug that made it impossible to complete, why do you seem to be the only actually having it?
---
[Minion master reaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr3wKK-xPSo) and [condi mirage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYmC833WVD0)
---
You mean bouncy mushrooms?
---
try&lt;3
---
its a feature.
---
Yep that certainly is hidden. By which I mean nobody can bloody see it.
---
good luck on your chrono adventures
---
I finished the last instance right before work, and I was apparently shook by it so much that my boss noticed and asked if I needed the day off. 
---
I would of said yes if not for needing money for tissues to sob into XD
---
I personally think those kinds of achievements are good but the events in question have to be big and easy to fail. Such an event should have a harder time succeeding than failing.   
---
Can't slap that on easy shit
---
If events have a big impact on achievements, the map or spawn interesting other events than they should be on some sort of timer where they definitely fail. Also looking at Temple events here. The orr maps are fun right after reset and event empty for a week. 
---
The worst will be when the map becomes less popular. Good luck doing the meta then. 
---
This won't ever happen, because it basically auto manages inventory for you. Therefore, you won't need more bag space in your inventory as much as before, so bag slots lose usefulness, and don't sell as much.
---
But I've waited for this update 3 months just to play one day, do the story and map completion. I don't like dragons blood weapons  so I have absolutely nothing to do on this map. 
---
Maybe it's just latent nostalgia from seeing dwarves architecture again, but something about this episode... the colors, the tone, the environment, the characters... it felt like the original Guild Wars did. It threw me off guard in a really good way.
---
Let's not mix up our stages here! Proper order according to the Kübler-Ross model are:  
---
1. Denial and isolation
---
2. Anger
---
3. Bargaining
---
4. Depression
---
5. Acceptance
---
So today we're all getting ANGRY AS FUCK!  
---
Save your gold for tomorrow.
---
Do the 1st Story Mission or if possible use a guild hall located in HoT/PoF and walk out by the front door/portal(not sure if it works in case no character of your alt account has ever done the 1st story instance of HoT since you can't go though the portal int he Silverwastes by foot unless you did the 1st story on a character).
---
Hillbilly raptor too pls
---
ючяЧ:щщщэййнйфыфф
---
Isn't that the last story map?
---
So Qadim is still bigged i guess? 
---
The rift in the Deldrimor ruins is still the same it seems.
---
I'll wait for another patch then.
---
Good work on the rest.
---
Aurene is still alive in the mist.
---
Prove to me that her magic was consumed or taken somewhere else, or I stay with my belief.
---
&gt; If the way I want to play is to do map completion first, I should be able to. 
---
What you don't get is that you can map complete, but you tell yourself you can't.
---
It's just the way you have to map complete these end game maps goes against what you expected, but that is not anets fault.
---
I am also around since BWEs and?
---
The Last Instance "Crystal Dragon" Kralk was charging powers of Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Balthazar.
---
Need more devs on EU
---
We just use lyssas mirror to reflect his magic back on him. It's a pretty big tell
---
They've been dead the whole time
---
Na I quit playing the game shortly thereafter so I cant help you son. 
---
Because I dont agree with you, thats why
---
I would help you doing it every spare time I can gather and bring friends.
---
Another thing about his eye being messed up.
---
The cut scene the Eye of Janthir shows us at the end of LS3 actually shows Kralkatorrik with a messed up left eye.
---
Try and do as much events as you can. And stick around for a bit after one event ended, there might be a follow up event. 
---
And you can always port to another starting zone. I think every starting zone has at least one waypoint unlocked? For me it seems to be that way at least 
---
Can someone run through the what useful things there are to spend with each of the LWS3/4 currencies. Aside from the obvious ascended trinkets with HoT stats. Some of the currencies (e.g. Kralkatite Ore I think it was) don't appear to be useful at all?
---
No she switched bodies with Caithe, Captain Ginyu style
---
Gonna have to gamble. No way to get that if you lost it
---
*new episode release day* 
---
I'm so ready for this! Let's go!
---
*after playing the episode*
---
I feel lied to and cheated. I didn't sign up for this...
---
&gt;Honestly it would be pretty ballsy to keep her dead, and I’d actually kinda like it.
---
It won't work as a story. Just think about it - all this time we're following Glint's grand plan. Now it fails and we save the world by improvising? Just how cheesy would that be? Nah. My money's on "part of the plan".
---
I still remember when Gw2 had mana potions, what a hellfest it was
---
Reanimate and control because she strong. Obviously I'm memeing but like everything zhaitan reanimated was under his control.
---
this is really good&lt;3
---
I like them. Or not. 
---
finally she is dead. Hope we can kill Caithe too. 
---
I mean, I don't think it will be all that useful for my Condi Mirage for example. 
---
While I fully expect her to not stay dead *now*, when I was playing I totally cared. It was gut-wrenching ending, strong and emotional, beautifully done. It worked in the moment perfectly. That's all that matters IMO.
---
Didn't they remove the failed event requirement from precursor collections one month ago?
---
On every map youprobably have some minis and tonics if you find value in those (most notably you have the giant and mini tonic in LS3 that are very funny and sometimes useful).
---
Lake Doric has a few skins that cost Jade Shards that you could find interesting. Jade shards also used if you need exotic Seraph inscription/insigna.
---
Fire Orchid are used for the Magnanimous oil/crystal/sharpening stone (mostly the oil will be useful in PvE iirc). Also you can get some Oakheart Essence (the vine thing tha tyou canshoot) for your Guild hall.
---
LS3 Currency is used for Aurora (250 of each at least).
---
Kralkatite can be used to craft the [Astral](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Astral_weapons) and [Stellar](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stellar_weapons) weapons.
---
Difluorite can be used for the [Position Rewinder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder) (very fun and useful gadget to have in shared inventory) and for [Coconut Milk](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bottle_of_Coconut_Milk) used in the cheap power food alternative [Avocado Smoothie](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Avocado_Smoothie) or the optimal food for 2 PvE condi builds iirc [Plate of Beef Rendang](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Plate_of_Beef_Rendang).
---
Inscribed Shards useful for exotic Plaguedoctor inscription/insigna. You will also need some for the heroic commander back item (the one which colelctions starts by speaking to your herald in Kourna).
---
Mistonium is used for the Requiem Armor sets.
---
Branded Mass is used for the Dragonsblood weapons (you will need 210 in total for each exotic + ascended weapon you will want to craft).
---
I am level 80 so that's all good. Thank you!
---
Yes, if they intend to keep Kralk around for another 2-3 seasons so they can set up a reasonable alternative plan to deal with him. However, they stressed on the importance and urgency of the threat he poses, both in this episode and the previous one. So there's no time for setting up. Either Glint's plan is still going and there's no plot twist or we're about to see a monumental deus ex machina.
---
So helpful! Thank you!!
---
He did, but you don't get.
---
Love this meme rofl
---
Very interesting, I havent raided in prolly over 6 months, but if this could happen I might get into it again 🤔
---
Pretty sure I can get a run going every evening of the week, we are on EU and raiding anyways^^
---
There are two problems with this:
---
1. Kralk is too much of a danger already to have a whole season of us dallying about with Bubbles. I mean, come on, just let him on a rampage in the Mists and in the Domain of the Lost and basically wherever he pleases? 
---
2. Putting the dragons to sleep isn't a solution. It is how every cycle ended so far. Without them magic seeps back, attracts their attention and they eventually wake to wreak havoc and destruction once more. The intent is to create a balanced system where this no longer happens.
---
I love this piece. I believe this is the track that's playing when you first enter in THK it instantly made me feel so gloomy and sad. It's really a great piece of music. 
---
diviners has been in pvp for a while and hasnt been used, why now?
---
Straw Hat did indeed become the king of pirates.
---
Oh wow, didn't notice this at all. Thanks.
---
Power firebrand too, manages more than decent dps with 5 man quickness
---
Don't use new reddit layout, that will fix it :^) They had to break everything xD
---
All depends how far they jump in time, and if all the main races are still allies. For instance, iirc, the massive air ships are a result of combining multiple race technology and skills. 
---
If we're taking Charr in a vacuum (and another 250 yrs), I'd imagine stuff akin to fighter jets. 
---
They will have a hole for their tail in every armor set.

Time to return to raiding scene 
---
Add a spoiler tag will you
---
Gonna restart raiding soon
---
they made you work hard in this one
---
The time the troll was killing the innocent player and roaming around xD
---
I would also like an invite if possible, we can try if I can outdps you (EU) 
---
*smooth*
---
Nope, there's no reasoning there. It may look like there is, but there isn't. The fact that things are somewhat automated doesn't mean that making it more automated is a bad thing.
---
But what if you could support fully and do way more dps than saaaay minstrel
---
\*my mesmer friend going after Caithe memories with the centaur tribe, after slaughtering them\*  
---
I COULD OUTRUN A CENTAUR !
---
Thanks for the tipp with the crates, I'm gonna try opening them more regularly now.
---
"I call dibs on his boots"

Thanks for this tipp, never thought of it for getting the Gift :)

Yes, the actors have been doing a wonderful job in the past releases. I was particularly impressed by Brandon Bales going through so many emotions as male sylvari when interacting with various characters all the way to the fateful conclusion with Kralkatorrik where we saw the weight of it all crushing down on him. And I gotta hand it to Cherise Boothe for Zafirah's wonderful line delivery; this episode and the previous one really showcase her talents as an actress. Any chance of sharing what other NPC roles she's done for GW2? :)
---
Speaking of voice actors knocking it out of the park, may I ask who originally voiced Glint in Path of Fire? And why was she replaced with Jocelyn Blue for Season 4? Although Jocelyn brings her considerable talent to the role, there was something otherworldly with Glint's warm PoF voice while Jocelyn's sharper timbre is a different take on the character. I've been curious about answers for both of these questions ever since I noticed the difference, and I wonder why the PoF VA couldn't be brought back to voice Glint and other ambient roles to fill the contract time requirements.
---
Currently Tyria has computers, robots, airships, mobile phones, etc. and the society of the combined races is pretty much modern but fantasy. Way beyond steampunk already besides the charr aestethic.
---
If there is a sequel after a time jump it would be straight scifi fantasy. Flying through space on magical airships and such.
---
You can give each mount an unique keybind in the settings!
---
I only mentioned it because when people used to have all but 1 wipe or of they didn't actively throw the crystal it would appear that the final laser was just part of the death animation rather than being a final move before the automated crystal throw finished it off.
---
^(You are looking at this from GW2 perspective, GW3 won't have levels or zone scaling, it will be one big map with player housing, few ability-skill heroes like in OW, and free market, gear will be visuals only. Group PvP may be instanced so they wont get ganked. )
---
This. I dunno why you would consider this to be a bad thing, really. I come in every few months and get to play the next part in the story. 
---
I'm sure I'll get the bug to get back into things at some point and there's going to be so much to do. 
---
Yep, as of ~1 year ago.
---
It's not that GW2 is bad or anything, I just played plenty of it. Modern MMOs have continuously gone lighter and lighter on their social interaction, so my main reason for MMORPGs was already ~gone.
---
Now that I've seen everything often enough to be done with it, there's just little to do. I log in once every story patch, finish it in 2 hours or so, and that's done again.
---
That being said, this isn't necessarily a sad or bad thing. I have a huge backlog of games to play, and amazing games come out all year. I have managed to get endless hours of quality gaming time out of titles such as Ghost of a Tale, Return of the Obra Dinn, Kingdom Battle or Octopath Traveller now that I've mostly quit GW2.
---
What I'm trying to say is (i guess): even MMOs have shelf-lives. It's not a bad thing either.
---
Hope they add diviners gear to the fractal vendor &amp; them not having it when lw3 stuff did was an oversight.
---
Yes and regardless of how Kralk and Bubbles are handled, Jormag and Primordus are asleep and so will wake up in however long and do just that, or do you think we’re going to find them when they’re sleeping and stab them in the eye?
---
Yes, and probably a few abuses where mount and gliding exclusion zones don't overlap perfectly. Or just cheesing extra height with springer+griffon. Basically they explicitly said mounts were designed so you *can't* dismount midair because of gliding abuses, then went back on that with this mastery.
---
Where did you find this OP?
---
What did they do
---
Healthy games don't have infinite content and replayability. GW2 has a ton of content, but you will eventually burn out if you play it every day for years. NO game can generate content faster than power users or long-term users will burn through it.
---
Seriously? Hah, awesome!
---
That's an excellent idea. As a rev main, the 1 or two quotes have gotten a little boring. Some more (especially situational ones!) would be very welcome!
---
They have an Arenanet icon next to their in-game character name, it should be hard to miss. Though I've heard they're mostly in US servers, I haven't seen one in EU so far :(
---

---
Nice.  Thanks for clarifying.   As I had guessed then.  It was a super cool moment.  I honestly thought Braham was gonna bite the dust there and then.   (And i'd have been ok with it.)
---
Was it implied Braham stopped that beam with his shield, or that Aurene helped/did most of the heavy lifting?  I know she flies in, but all Braham's talk of 'hey i can totally deal with this, get behind me' made me think the game implied he stopped it.  Or is it classic Norn claiming feats that aren't strictly true? :)
---
Defeatist attitude is pretty much the guild wars staple though. Everything the player does makes things far worse until just before the end. It was like this in Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall, exceptionally not in EotN, killing zhaitan was bad, killing mordremoth was bad, etc. Everyone can die, and if you interpret the fear not this night lyrics in a certain way, they will.
---
On topic, if she's full dead another way out from here would be to try and find another dragon who apparently might know some relevant dragon secret related to ascension. Enter Kuunavang and Cantha :p
---
Shadow trap new meta! I approve.
---
And leaving her dead would make everything since her egg was introduced feel cheap and pointless. Like, okay, what do we do now? Have some random spirit from the mists give us info on an artifact that can serve the same purpose? So now we have years of story invalidated with a swift plot change that people claim is “ballsy?” How is it ballsy to build up these characters and then axe them just for the sake of adding drama. The universe is unraveling if we don’t kill Kralk and Tyria unravels if we do kill Kralk. The stakes are high without constant deaths. And Aurene eating joko most likely had more reason than just helping a friend. The events that have conspired have happened as part of the plan for her. So why would Joko be a big part of this prophecy if it weren’t involved with Aurene reviving herself? How is that a surprise or far fetched to anyone? We as players may immediately make the correlation, but you have to think of it from the characters perspective. They would be reeling with grief, not just immediately say... well she ate a lich so she’s obviously going to come back and then be upset because it’s a “cheap move.” They’ll be surprised and excited. It would just be so much worse if she was just gone from a story perspective. And if she just joins the mists it’s almost as bad because how is her being in the mists any different than what glint could have been doing this entire time? Because now Kralk is injured severely? Diminishing her death in this episode, which wouldn’t even be the case if her dying is necessary for her to ascend or for us to discover the effect of Joko or even Zhaitan on her, is a lot better than diminishing literally years worth of story development and emphasis on character building just to make her some martyr for a cause that wasn’t even completed and if the death sticks leaves us finding some completely different solution that will have to appear out of nowhere and have escaped the mind of a prophetic dragon for some unknown reason....  And the black screen saying I don’t know might as well have been a to be continued. It’s pretty obvious to me the way it ended and the banter from Ogden and Glint that she is most likely not dead. Also, she didn’t crystallize and shatter like Glint and Vlast, so I guess we’ll just ignore that if she is dead? Just chalk it up to a silly inconsistency or pretend it doesn’t matter when we’ve been communicating with shattered pieces of Glint and Vlast this expansion? Not to mention Glint died via Kralk and shattered, so why would Aurene not unless there was more to it?
---
Everyone just keeps saying how cheap it would be if she were brought back to life or that it would be “mcguffin” because they want to be edgy or think they’re better st writing the story... but if you consider the facts that we have there’s no reason to believe that her staying dead is better than her using the absorbed power of a lich or the spheres of Mordremoth and Zhaitan OR the remnants of a mist traveling god to be able to resurrect herself. Blish died and is serving his purpose. Trahearne died and served his purpose. There’s no reason on top of the years of story that Aurene needs to stay dead to make a bigger impact. And who is to say that we don’t finish Kralk out of necessity because of the risk he poses to the mists itself without Aurene only to find after the fact that Aurene is alive again.  It keeps her out of the fight with Kralk but still lets her fulfill her destiny to become the new elder dragon, and gives closure to this years long journey. Then people argue that she will negate the threat of any villain we have in the future, but once she had became an elder dragon she may not be driven by the same will to protect us and Tyria that she has right now. Balthazar and Joko May have just been fated for her to fight to gain what she needed, and once she’s an elder dragon it could easily be written that she’s fulfilled her purpose and have little to no involvement outside of future elder dragon magic balance. And if they put the elder dragon stuff on the back burner after we kill Kralk, that means we are on our own with whatever threat comes after. Sure, she may empower us or give us some kind of Glint-Like visions from time to time, but that’s nowhere near the level of involvement she has had up to this point.
---
Anyway, I just think it’s a little short sighted to keep bashing the idea of her coming back saying it’s cheap or to say that her death is necessary because she’s a deus ex dragon or whatever because it doesn’t reflect the significance of the events that we’ve already had and dismisses story that hasn’t even been written. 
---
Basically there were no stamina but instead each skills required an amount of mana, and the blue bar was your mana, you had to drink a potion to refill it then use skills
---
i believe its intended that it resets when that happens. but i'm having trouble imagining nobody having a crystal at that point in the fight.
---
Excuse my ignorance, where do you get the LoD from?  I rushed through the story and didn't have long to explore the map too much last night.
---
Fractals are not raids, you just described precisely what raids are (focus on boss mechanics, lots of unique fashion rewards, and lots of background lore to be found lying around). If Fractals are supposed to be 5-man raids they should undo most of their developments over it and embrace this so that they can focus on exclusively making bosses, which I would enjoy but, I don't think that's their plan (to make Fractals equivalent to raiding on a lesser scale).
---
The closest thing to a trampoline in-game is probably the big hole thing in the fractal lobby.  If you jump in, you get teleported up, and then fall down into the whole again, then get teleported up, and you can loop that indefinitely.
---
Yes, I completed the last mission.
---
Yeah, since we don't hear Revenants talking much (no shouts, very little idle or combat quotes) i thought this could do the trick.
---
No problem! 
---
I don't like playing wvw, so I Just do the easy dailies, like big spender, flip some camps, kill some veterans, etc.
---
Considering that a legendary is a long term thing usually, you'll probably have your gift of battle ready, when you have the other stuff together. :)
---
I don't think these fights were designed with very specific strategies in mind at all. There is plenty of leeway to do most of the mechanics, specially the few insta kill/nearly insta kill ones. We're just used to ignoring the fact that there even are instabilities, because they didn't do much before save for the ones that were important to prevent "stack and hack" strategies, and so we have only one single build for all sets of instabilities when in reality a true instability system would force us to switch on demand, kind of where they seem to be heading. A smart player who adapts might even break speed records when instabilities like the one that increases our damage are put on. We have raids for content that is more or less predictable and does not force you to adapt builds (not a coincidence, many raiders don't enjoy this aspect of Wing 5, specially in Soulless Horror), and I like it very much that they are making Fractals more of its own niche with instabilities.

---
Kinda the only reason i miss personal story
---
I just play the class, really. It's frustrating at first, because you just wanna be a master at it instantly. 
---
I made my Renegade at Halloween and levelled her via Lab farming. I found that to really help how to learn how to play the class (because I got to learn it against bosses like the candy corn viscount). I learned my defenses, when to dodge, when to use my heals, and how to time my legend swap so I get the benefit of Charged Mists. That really helped me and it's probably why I fell in love with the class so much. 
---
But I've since put in 330 hours on her, I've really gotten the hang of it and feel most comfortable on this class. But I still don't consider myself a master.
---
Just play the class, take it to world bosses, do some metas, that sort of stuff. It's not gonna happen overnight. To get better, you gotta put in the time, no way around it. 
---
I find doing a berry farm run in Bitterfrost is a good way to test a new character. Those mobs hit hard, you have to down em fast. 
---
Lore-wise. I never said there was a hint lol
---
The fact that so many people are upset at the ending shows, to me, that ANet's storytelling is in a good spot right now. Folks wouldn't be literally crying if they weren't invested in the characters and story.

Dang, I want them to add a quaggan mafia to the game.   A quaggan NPC in Lions Arch that will loan you 10G just for asking, but then anytime on the next daily reset a dozen level 90 quaggans dressed like ninjas attack you randomly wherever you are, whatever you are doing until you are downed.  The beatings  continue daily and the only way to get it to stop is to pay them 12G.
---
Jahai Bluffs. Weaker patch in terms of story and while I prefer the looks on the new map, Jahai Bluffs had better events.
---
It also had more raw content with the Sun's Refugee instance. 
---
Finally it had a raid too which is better than the new fractal IMO. 
---
Just wanted to add something - even if you do the metas and do the puzzle, its not guaranteed to get the plate for the green room. How is that good design?
---
This was supposed to be a miniature battle arena (designed after their logo obviously), but they scrapped the mini pokemon fighting thingy.

Charr biologists will at some point develop the Legendary "Charr-Nip" (a legendary version of [1]). At this point, all further progress will stop, at some point revert, the Legendary will be lost, and the cycle repeats.

Thanks for sharing! Glad to see you continue chronicling Scarlet's journey via your art and showing different sides of her. Although your version is more busty compared to the original, I like how the shading captures the uncertainty of Ceara's future lying in front of her, and the face captures her calculating genius from the few moments she was shown pondering what there was to life. Keep up the good work! :)
---
Here's to hoping we meet Ceara's ghost in the Mists one day as she still has so much she could tell us or even aid us in our plight. :)

What about the envoy precursor? Does it have div yet?

Oh, i must have missed that. I guess that also means that beyond that there's no more info about it.

I guess we can only speculate when it will be released or how it would look. 
---
&gt;  I thought they were intended to be added shortly after the Festival of the Four Winds.
---
That's unfortunate. Nobody from Arenanet ever promised or suggested that.
---
I think it would be a good way to get rid of those characters we don't see much lets be honest they need to kill Zojja off its been 3 to 4 years since we saw her last there is no point in having her alive anymore. Also this episode was good in setting up the finale if there is an episode 6 obviously there are contrasting reports on this with redbull saying this is the finale and MMORPG saying its the penultimate episode. I think the finale should be bigger and this episode obviously hurt us and I think next episode we will fail worse wanting revenge we pull our army into a massive battle with Kralkatorrik and we get our allies killed. Leading to season 5 being us coming to terms with failing badly which I think would be an interesting story to cover. Obviously I like Logan, Marjory and Caithe but just cause I like them doesn't mean I think they should protected from death.
---
Faren is still racing. Koss is on Koss.
---
Yes, I really enjoyed what little we saw of dredge in this episode, and Steve Blum voicing Sergei and Mikhail was quite nice in how different yet similar he made them sound, not to mention the surprisingly grim subject matter. The dredge ambient dialogue is quite interesting as are the few written dialogues we get to experience, not to mention us finally meeting female dredge! I would've wanted to hear more regarding their feelings for letting Thunderhead Keep, the stronghold of the dwarven race they so hated, stay intact without tearing it down, and how the Moletariate as a whole is faring following their failed alliance with Scarlet, but understandably there's only so much one can do in one living world episode. Still, I appreciated the dredge's return, as they are one of the many fascinating races on Tyria. :)
---
They'll nuke themselves back to prehistoric.
---
wait, thats specifically sylvari related? i remember having a downed ally close to a downed PvE enemy and when the enemy was no longer a valid target for a finish, it finished the ally instead.
---
So if I stopped playing somewhere around scarlet's marionette how much does unlocking all the living story/living world things cost me ? 
---
After thinking about the whole thing, I sincerely doubt Aurene will stay dead. She's played a huge role since the very beginning of season 2. Her egg was the main focus of season 2 and HoT and then when she hatched she was one of the most important characters in season 3 and PoF. I just don't think Anet would have the balls to kill her off. If she does stay dead, then I'm sure her death will serve a 'Greater Purpose' (Glint's legacy?). 
---
\&gt;  Then they used the bond between Caithe and Aurene to hammer in the point that Aurene really is dead and finished for good. 
---
Which they really only established this episode, haven't they. Very "helpful".
---
I can't see any McGuffin out of this corner either and it leaves me (potentially) very disappointed in overall arch, despite the very good moment-to-moment writing and flavor.  
---
\&gt;  She really should stay dead so that her death means something and the story needs to find an other resolution. 
---
Absolutely, she should. But she can't... or McGuffin.
---
If we are choosing between wasting her death or wasting the one masterfully developed connection of PC and NPC in this game, I think I prefer Aurene back. It is not like death means much in the story by now any way, which might be a subject for a whole new discussion (bringing Eir back cheapens Bram's arc, bringing Snaff back does same to Zojja - who, btw, is completly out of character for not appearing in the story afterwards; PC comes back to life all the time which is cheap on its own since we know we can't die in MMO...)
---
Yeah. It just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.
---
Feels like there's very sudden jumps in story writing lately.
---
* Joko is immortal... until Aurene eats him.
---
* There is only one Dragonsblood Spear, which had to be destroyed... until oh look, an extremely convenient and sudden discovery of not just another but the means to mass produce a whole bunch of them!
---
* Glint can't see beyond her death... until she apparently could and prepared for Aurene? 
---
She dead now
---
It would be pretty nice to hear the revenant legends' dialogue, especially as there's a specific location on this map and an act you can do which Jalis would find interesting. ;)
---
It's a bit of a shame that these specific lines can't be implemented more often. At least Kalla got unique lines if you have certain items linked to her in your inventory or if you pass by her statue in the Black Citadel, but it'd be nice to hear more one day if the VA budget allows for such.
---
there are other ways to write a character out of the story besides murder.
---
also i think that next episode won't be this big but more us establishing the arc of next season
---
Yes look at the GW2 story up until this weeks episode we have always won. Zhaitan we won, Scarlett we won, Mordremoth we won and Joko we won. This game has never dealt with a story arc of use losing badly. Try and remember the tag line Anet used which you can see on MMORPG.com this episode will change the landscape of Tyria for good. I think if there is an episode 6 that tagline will be put into full force and Tyria will deal with massive deaths and with the thought that an elder dragon can travel through the mists and is actually unkillable.
---
Aurene level similar  spyro the dragon flying around burning little trains and going through hoops
---
Yeah you got a massive point there
---

He said the original statement though, just no follow-up. Perhaps he thought I was a female syvlari in his half-dead state and got all embarrassed after he drank water and realized his mistake. 
---
It would have been some nice representation, though, and my character would have liked the attention after plant husbando's death. :(
---
Unless they want to waste 5 years (and arguably even more) of setting Aurene up, that's not going to happen in all likelihood. 
---
Yep, exactly
---
I've got 52 of those XD Don't see what ppls problem is here. You have to do "harder" content in order to get somewhere in a game. And it's not just  "walk/run/fly - done". Booohoo. 
---
But saying Zojja just went on holiday. Also I think she should be in the next fight with Kralkatorrik. I find it weird she wasn't in this episode I get it voice acting issues with Felicia Day. Hopefully it can be like the finale of season 2 where Zojja came back. She comes back in episode 6/episode 1 season 5.
---
I really really doubt GW3 will ever be a thing. The only reason people even speculate about it is because GW2 is technically a sequel ('if there's a GW2 why wouldn't there be a GW3?'). However, it just wouldn't work. If GW3 does come out at some point I believe that the Charr might not even exist. Otherwise we'd end up with a really technologically advanced race and I don't think Anet would like that. You might not know but a long time ago even rifles and pistols in GW2 were very controversial. And many people said they wouldn't even try the game because of the engineer. Can you imagine what would happen if they started using even more advanced technology?
---
I mean.... end of Season 2 wasn't really us winning... the Pact basically got wiped out in a single attack. That isn't really much of a win. 
---
&gt; But even if this feels like deus ex machina, it's better than giving us a new main character that is essential for the story, kill that character for the drama and then just bring him back because you need him for the story.
---
You mean, like Balthazar killed the Commander in PoF story?
---
I don't agree it devalues the character. In the very same logic, every danger devalues every character in every story, because you always have "plot armor" in the back of your mind. That's not an issue. Stories need main characters and they need to play their roles in the resolution. That doesn't mean characters shouldn't be exposed to danger, or even death, to provoke strong feelings in the audience. That's what art is about, after all.
---
Mistlock Instability: Slippery Slope  -  Enabled
---
Considering that Anet won't change the running game anymore however, that story would have to be restricted to the next map. Which kind of lessens the impact. Or do you expect them to actually pull a pre-searing-esque move again? Like WoW did with Cataclysm. I couldn't imagine that in an update. Even an expansion is questionable. They've been so focused on moving forward, barely stopping to work on what they once created.
---
When I first followed the rabbit I thought "Oh boy, I'm about to get jumped by Vaettir" since there were already quite a few nods to GW1 in this episode.  
---
Next, I thought for sure there'd be an achievement after I needed to call for help as the little bugger tried to stunlock me.  
---
Crazy Jackalope smh
---
And that's exactly why I hope they really have a good solution to escape the corner they wrote themselves into.
---
It's a bad thing to create a McGuffin to solve the problem.
---
It's even worse to bring back from the dead a main character you killed off.
---
From the two options I prefer the first.
---
But I really really hope they have a story solution that is better than the two options here.
---
Reminds me of when I did the season 2 bit where Caithe kills Wynn in a flashback.  I had that quaggan mini where it's wearing a bed sheet as a ghost.  Ruined the moment completly

The point of layers is to not load things.

I can tell a car uses an engine by looking at it, it's just how things work. You can't tell me I'm lying because I haven't opened the chassis and examined it thoroughly. Software development isn't a mystical art where each wizard has a secret recipe.

I don't think you can remove them entirely, but you can train other crafting professions to replace the ones you have.
---
They could left it, I was sure it was supposed to be like that, and it was cool to hear from time to time.
---
Actually, it is done over and over again, multiple times in GW alone, which is hardly refreshing. Was unexpected the first time and is completely predictable every time afterwards.
---
&gt; You don't play/read/watch to find out what happens. You do it for the experience.
---
Speak for yourself. I engage with stories to see *how* and *why* things happen and I base my experience on that. This is why when the writing is bad, my experience is bad with it.
---
nahh, i meant more like:
---
* day one after the assault on kralk was denial (joko power theories
---
* we're on day 2 now, as in stage 2
---
I would gladly join you in this crusade.
---
I was really waiting for it because sometimes, developers underestimate the effects of their jingles. I could not have been more proud of our anet gang for disabling it for this specific moment to let the final scene sink in properly.
---
What sort of hdd/ssd you got? Have you checked the error logs? 
---
What I see is more and more people stop being emotional about it and start asking questions about the quality of the arc so again, I don't agree.
---
I think that 1 hour timer is bad, rather than failing event cuz if it was 15 minutes nobody would care, that much.
---
I'm not going to state with certainty that the next project is mobile, but I'll happily stand by every single word I stated above. 
---
&gt; I'd ask you to please stop being daft, but that conspiracy theory is so far beyond all sanity that one would have to be clinically retarded to believe it. So I'd rather ask you to just pick that blatant misinformation, insert it deep into your rectum, and fuck off with it. 
---
Thinking that anet might have a next project is clearly beyond all sanity and I'm clinically retarded to believe it. Blatant misinformation will be inserted into my rectum. 
---
Wait weren't you that person that cried about feeling physically repulsed by toxicity and elitism? Right - another one of these super friendly casual players that believes their casual playstyle makes them friendlier than everyone else. But when push comes to shove it turns out they can't deal with any disagreement or conflict whatsoever.
---
I suggest you go back to the official forums. I hear that place is healthier for you. 
---
You mean, because ANet has never spent many years with something just to abandon it suddenly?
---
Black Citadel movie productions?
---
Specialists in making action-packed movies. 
---
&gt;I don't think the Ancient Karka (or even combining with the Phase 2 events) is worth a zone. I'd rather they get converted into a (few) Story Journal instance(s).
---
No open world version? The Ancient Karka wouldn't be a world boss anymore then. If so, what's the point? People want to see LW1 content return, as it was or better, not a 5-man downgraded version.
---
The best part of LW1 was open world content, if you start killing that and turning everything into instances or fractals, you're ruining what made LW1 great in the first place.
---
&gt;They don't need to move Cragstead or North Nolan Hatchery, they could just bring the Flame and Frost events back as they were. There's no need to change that. It'd be no more intrusive than the Side Stories content in all honesty. Besides, if you're making new zones, then you're not bringing back the content. You're just reusing art assets for new content, like the Nightmare Fractal was. There were events, but most of Season 1 story content was, in fact, in instances. And almost all of what events exist, were mere side content that could be brought back without qualm as they'd be no different thematically than the Iron March's mordrem events.
---
Most of LW1's open world content in the old zones was way too disruptive. They could afford it because they lasted 2-4 weeks only, and then the flow was back to normal. The likes of Scarlet's Invasions wouldn't work as permanent content, so you either take them to a new zone, or scrap them altogether.
---
Some of them, like the Sonic Periscopes or the Krait Obelisk Shards could be repurposed as Side Stories, but the big ones wouldn't work.
---
Flame and Frost events were also pretty bad, if they are to bring LW1 back, it would be dumb of them not to improve them. New zones could help expand the old stories, so it's old content but it's also new stuff (like the Nightmare Fractal, where the only thing they recycled were art assets, everything else is new).
---
&gt;If they had copies of Kessex, why aren't they used in the PS maps? I ask again. Do they actually have them, or is this another case of you using words of certainty, while making things up. You seem to have a bit of a bad habit doing that...
---
You could learn datamining, or alternatively, check them live through GW2Tyria, Toxic Kessex Hills was there last time I checked. They're still missing some old maps, and some doodads don't load properly, so what you see in GW2Tyria isn't everything.
---
Logan is literally around the corner too. Shame
---
I never get the prompt to do the combined attack. I was wondering if anyone has a video showing it or a better explanation that the very simple one on Dulfy’s?
---
I know, they are not my own screenshots 
---
yeah, no. i have to disagree with this
---
The OP of this sub-thread is talking about GW2 being put in maintenance mode in favour of a mobile game. That's retarded. If you want to change the goalpost from "maintenance mode in favour of a mobile game" to "Thinking that anet might have a next project", go ahead.
---
Most Gen1 Legys are \~1000g cheaper to build than their Gen2 counterparts.
---
So if you want a "skinless" Legendary Axe which is cheaper than Astralaria... Just get Frostfang?
---
Map completion has to be done on any variation of the core profession, so you should be able to use core engi with no problems.
---
you could always experiment. you can use paints you've not unlocked yet when previewing.
---
Istan is somewhat more replayable than certain other LS maps, but it's mostly vastly more rewarding than ... literally all other LS maps. To the point where it effectively hinders the replayability of other maps (which cannot compete in terms of rewards). 
---
If you want a good example of "replayability", look at HoT maps, fractals, raids, WvW and PvP. All that content the casual players said didnt' belong in GW2. Turns out all of these have far more replayability than any of the LS maps other than the ones you farm for gold. And this was true even without the rewards.
---
Also there was a saltspray dragon in Elona.  In the hidden djinn city
---
There is another one where you have to remove your armor in the sauna room to be confortable.
---
I'm returning to the game after several weeks, so I'm out of the loop. It's possible to dismount midair now, at least with the griffon?
---
Ohh, I see. Thank you so much. I don’t mind having the icons but it seemed stupid that I chose both a light and medium armour trainer. I’m playing Necro and heard Tailor and Artificer is a good two for my class, thank you again!
---
I would prefer Charr Master Race
---
typical elitist
---
Look elsewhere in this thread where I actually recommend nightmare runes.
---
I was keeping this answer relevant to the question of what rune from the choices, and in that scenario you took chaos to make up the lost condition duration. Once more, yes chaos is bad.
---
You are totally right. 
---
Open world, PvP and Maybe fractals. 
---
Or aurene becomes the elder dragon replacement in the mists
---
OR the dead aurene isnt actually aurene at all but a branded sculpture of her
---
OR Aurene actually won the fight and took Kralkatorrik's place quite literally.
---
if you are with a friend, do NOT res him if he is killed by the rubbles; he will be stuck and will have to restart 
---
So they pretty much just took her out off screen?
---
You are the Professor Oak of the Guild Wars verse. If you complete the DevDex, will you publish your results in a scientific paper?
---
Cant talk for pvp or wvw but pve is as strong as ever and the current story update made sure that everyone and their grandmothers will be back for the next season. I would say it is definitely worth playing.
---
This actually follows heroic myth, where the hero dies, but returns to slay the monster. It definitely was tense, and follows in the footsteps of actual mythology, you call that bad writing? Maybe the execution wasn't golden, but compare that with Zhaitan's death. Anet has been improving massively.
---
Now if you want death to be permanent, pick a pulpy eighties thriller.
---
To be fair, gw2 'elder dragons' arent real dragons like in other fantasy stuff, I dont know about aurene etc tho, they are champions of the elder dragons, so technically they could be real dragons (created by the magic come to life-elder dragons-)
---
Kind of like that one portal in Rata Sum that the Asura was building that was meant to go to the Polymock arena. Back before they decided to scrap all of the minigames they had planned.
---
I _think_ some of the weapon skins in the tp dropped in price recently. Over Halloween I looked at getting a few of the spectral and glacial skins, didn't have enough, carried in with life. Checked again and they're cheaper than I remember them being? I didn't write down the prices so I can't confirm definitely 
---
If Aurene can go fight an elder dragon at age 2 despite facing certain-death, you can get through the rest of this workweek. 
---
I didn't mention mobile games. In order to get to mobile games you need to go up the chain quite a bit. 
---
&gt; You moving the goalpost from "maintenance mode in favour of a mobile game" to "Thinking that anet might have a next project" does not make the notion of a *maintenance mode in favour of a mobile game* any less retarded.
---
I tell you I don't know if the next project is mobile or not, and leave it undefined. You respond in saying that this  generalization doesn't make a mobile project in particular any less retarded. You didn't say anything about the generalization. You specifically did NOT state that GW2 being in maintenance mode for other projects is retarded; but again stressed how it'd be retarded to do it for mobile.
---
So why is the notion that GW2 is in maintenance so retarded for mobile in particular? Or are you simply unable to deduct logical relations from your own 2-line sentences? If you are, then that explains why i've never seen you have a coherent stand point on pretty much anything. 
---
Hulk Hogan.

&gt; No open world version? The Ancient Karka wouldn't be a world boss anymore then. If so, what's the point? People want to see LW1 content return, as it was or better, not a 5-man downgraded version.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The best part of LW1 was open world content, if you start killing that and turning everything into instances or fractals, you're ruining what made LW1 great in the first place.
---
The Ancient Karka wouldn't work as a world boss anymore anyways. That's no doubt part of why they won't bring it back. Having a map where there is literally nothing to do but a singular world boss chain is not a map worth having.
---
Almost all other S1 content can return as it was, but not Lost Shores. No one will give a damn, even if they include the phase 2 chain into that map.
---
&gt; Most of LW1's open world content in the old zones was way too disruptive. They could afford it because they lasted 2-4 weeks only, and then the flow was back to normal. The likes of Scarlet's Invasions wouldn't work as permanent content, so you either take them to a new zone, or scrap them altogether.
---
&gt; Some of them, like the Sonic Periscopes or the Krait Obelisk Shards could be repurposed as Side Stories, but the big ones wouldn't work.
---
The only "disruptive" events would be Kessex and Lion's Arch. Nothing else was disruptive at all.
---
Twisted Marionette's close, but only because they reshaped the map after removing it. Just un-reshape it and leave it active. We don't need the corpse, and the dialogues add nothing but unreliable narrators that are wrong in their statements (or got retconned).
---
Following that, there's Scarlet's Invasions that many would think would be disruptive, but if you scale it down a bit, you can just set it up like the Awakened Invasions. Mordrem Invasions too.
---
After that, **every** Season 1 event is just either soloable events or 5-man events.
---
And sans Kessex Hills, none of Season 1 blocked other content.
---
&gt; Flame and Frost events were also pretty bad, if they are to bring LW1 back, it would be dumb of them not to improve them. New zones could help expand the old stories, so it's old content but it's also new stuff (like the Nightmare Fractal, where the only thing they recycled were art assets, everything else is new).
---
They were simple, but not bad.
---
And if you move the old stories into new zones, they're not the old stories or old content. Nor is it really new content or new stories. It's rewriting of old stories. And that's what ArenaNet wants the least. That combination is the **absolute** most work for the absolute least gain.
---
Nightmare Fractal is not old content or stories either. It's new content and new story with old assets. That's fully different, and not what a Season 1 return would be.
---
To be fair, the game’s logo is literally a dragon.
---
Black lion chest content also changes, which results in quick price drop of its skins. There's also guaranteed skin unlocks.
---
The polymock arena was going to be in Rata Sum, it was going to be from the portal the asura was building there. What the op pictured was another minigame they had planned where you could duel minipets.
---
it's not an issue of making sense, it's an issue of emotional manipulation.
---
The hero sought to save the world. "If I keep trying, I'll be able to win," the hero thought. But the harder the hero fought, the further the world seemed to tumble away.
---
I fully expect that if she does, we will no longer be her Champion and she will very much not favour us any more. Some Champion we were, constantly ignoring her fears and feelings. 
---
While we see nothing to suggest Kralkatorrik took her magic, it is interesting to note that her body didn't crystallize like Glint's and Vlast's, who retained their magic. One could postulate that the lack of crystallization was due to a lack of crystal magic in her body.
---
But how do we make Sure they behave in the future? I mean elder dragon Aurene could kick their tails, but that wouldn't be pretty either.
---
I have seen that one (an elite ember/fire elemental) near the heroic font.  There was another one _____ Sun (can't remember first part of name) near there as well in case it is needed for another collection.
---
I wouldn't bother paying them for that hilarity.
---
She's been brain dead since HoT.
---
I haven’t played this game since 2 episodes, who is that in that last frame?
---
If only that deity wasn't hellbent on seeing the world crumble by getting rid of Kralkatorrik and taking his magic instead of giving it to Aurene for free.
---
Maybe not. Maybe that happened just to move Aurene to the mists.
---
An Aerith of sorts.
---
i don't think ghosts can be branded. mostly because ghosts seem unaffected by the brand all the way back in vanilla gw2 (somewhere in Blazeridge Steppes iirc)
---
It won't be emotional manipulation if Aurene comes back with a huge disadvantage, and/or after a long time, and/or thanks to someone else's death. So is is an issue of making sense; as long as her death is meaningful to the plot, then it won't be emotional manipulation.
---
This is true... pocket raptors are like Pringles to a Reaper, thanks to the Giant Ball Of AOE you get from Shroud attacks - bet you can’t eat just one. 😏
---
If you only have a little time to play each day, use the money you earn to invest. I have made around 3000 g since September, while only having time to play about 2-4 hours each week.

Getting the Plate from the Graveling is pretty 'fun', too; especially when tied to the limited length of the Light of Deldrimor buff. 
---
When i read posts like this i always remember how happy i am, because i don't give a single f*ck about achievements 
---
Then wouldn't her scions be helping Kralkatorrik instead of hindering?
---
More likely, in the evil Glint conspiracy, Glint isn't after saving the world, but just personal petty vengeance, and she's willing to sacrifice billions to see it come through, even her own child.
---
She just wants Kralkatorrik dead, and doesn't care what has to be sacrificed to get it.
---
what build are you running? 
---
step back and then you can bunny out of it
---
it's still emotional manipulation if they bring her back, that doesn't change because they gave aurene a cold
---
If you join the discussion of a sub-thread without picking up the issue at hand, don't feel addressed if the issue at hand is being called retarded. It's context. Reddit even has a link for it, so people know what is being talked about. Let me know if you're done moving the goal post. Right now we're at you're complaining about how you never participated at the issue at hand.
---
I did manage to complete the other 2 achievements, namely "kill 30 enemies with an axe" and "kill 4 enemies sequentially within 20 seconds of one another". Though that last one also took me a meta of tagging like crazy to get. Just wondering if anyone managed to do this 10% health one and how.
---
To be fair it's also called guild wars and I haven't been in a single guild war 
---
I have such a soft spot to the dredge. They created their own unique society, particularly compared to some of the supposed "good" societies they have more redeeming features. 
---
Yeh. I am still shitty about Queen Jennah using shock and awe tactics to make the only semi-democratic branch in her government shut up and do what she wants. 
---
I think he just meant the memory crystals. Which while Vlast (seemingly) shattered, doesn't require such.
---
Same, except I get some rewarding feelings on the game modes. anyway, PvE, archievements and collections are draining af. I got many collections open since years by now, because of the heavy farming you need to do (ressources, gold or timed items). Everytime I need periodically long breaks from the game itself to even get a feet into these things again.
---
Interesting, I saw Sean Connery.
---
&gt;And leaving her dead would make everything since her egg was introduced feel cheap and pointless.
---
I don't get why people keep saying this.
---
The fact that you're emotional and hating her death made all that purposeful.
---
then they should've turned her and not killed her. death is so effective  as a narrative devise because there's supposed to be no coming back from it. killing of a character just to bring it back is cheap especially if you kill said character at a cliffhanger.
---
OooOOo, debtor better pay up, otherwise quaggan has to perform a compulsory liquidation. Fuuuu!
---
OOF
---
killing an enemy in this context might mean delivering the killing blow and not only getting credit for a shared kill.
---
This is a GREAT service and thanks for offering. 
---
If I might: I’d suggest that you get this rolling by doing at least one train in HoT and PoF on a recurring schedule, and name it something consistent in LFG (something like ‘Crazy Janitsu’s Daily HP Train - Noobs Welcome!’). I’d also announce it in Map chat 10-15 min. before you set out, to give folks time to assemble, contact friends, etc. 
---
This way people will bring word back to their Guilds and groups, and make them much more open to the idea of putting together a ‘HP train fund’ to pay you for chartered, group outings (if that’s your goal). 
---
Last, and speaking purely as a player who is looking to join the occasional HP train to level-up alts, I’d recommend stating clearly before setting out what you expect characters to have access to to join - I’ve been in HoT trains that were very noob-friendly, and assumed that players might not have all the Waypoints unlocked, and ran manually to each HP after announcing in chat the next, linked Waypoint, whole others were lead by Ritiln junkies on griffins who flew off the instant the HP was claimed, clearly expecting everyone to just ‘follow the tag’.  Letting folks know ‘Please have Gliding and all Map WPs unlocked before joining, as we will be teleporting to each HP site’ or ‘No need to unlock WPs as we will be running to each HP’ or even ‘Glider/mount not needed - Mez will teleport players if-needed’ are all HUGELY helpful, as not everyone is at the same point in their progress. 
---
Good luck! I’ll definitely check this out!! 
---
If you are taking danger time aren't you overcapping crit by 8% assuming permanent slow?
---
Hey I thought I was cool
---
Not rework old ones, just make a new one.
---
The difference between time committed and rewards is the issue. If one fractal takes twice as long as another and gives the same rewards then its much worse value for the time invested.
---
That's a problem Imo, anet should be looking to make fractals more attractive to play as they add more fractals, if length increases but rewards don't eventually we'll see situations where people don't run dailies because they're all long ones for the day, which would be a shame.
---
You literally said you would avoid a daily fractal because of the new fractal. 
---
Killed all of them solo, but yeah I think it does work like that.
---
I think you meant Braham
---
She may just wake up as a zombie-like branded in the next episode, you have absolutely no way to tell it won't be the case from the last 2 seconds we see her.
---
And Ornate Rusted Keys from the underwater treasure chests aren't in wallet either.
---
One question, is simply dropping wells under your own feet a viable tactic in raids? I have serious problems with allies who dodge out of my wells and then complain about not having enough quickness. 
---
* pvp - highly depends on what role you would like to perform, for example guardian is good in team fight and can deal burst to a single target; ranger/mesmer/warrior are gud duelist roles and can go off to side objectives solo; and so on. just make sure to read the class guides and descriptions; it is even better to multi-class at pvp and fill the role needed, before the match starts (make sure to have builds set up in advance from pvp lobby).
---
* pve/fractals - go with warrior as support/boon rip or a thief as pure dps and possible skips provider, if you are more into hardcore support spec a druid healer.
---
* pve/open world - anything works really, but if you choose warrior for fractals with just few utility and trait changes can be a beast and fun to play; in case of a druid/ranger - spec back to dps for that.
---
To be fair: Six months later is shortly after?
---
perma contracts usually loose a bit of value around new releases when the BLC gets updated and plenty of players are using keys.
---
Also, glyphs, tonics, HI nodes, weapon skins and exclusive dyes that rotate into the loot table usually crash in value quite significantly. A fully unlocked BL weapon set that goes into the uncommon loot table can easily loose a couple of hundred gold, the same with dyes.
---
it's not an issue with making sense you fucking inbred
---
Upgrade them, spend them, downgrade them. All options always available.
---
Yeah, the Eater of Souls really made a point about the mortality of ghosts. I wonder if Kralkatorrik ate him, too.
---
I'd be rather surprised if ghosts can actually be branded. [They're more like focused magic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9rq648/lets_talk_about_death_magic_lore_thread_by/e8j44my/?context=10)
---
Play and find out.
---
Hint: It's not Taimi.
---
this is gold
---
LMFAOOOOO
---
Not a lore expert but for what I've heard the Guild Wars were two events in the game's history, and AFIK they didnt happen during either of the games. 
---
I also have to disagree. I may be in a minority, but for me the impactfull thing about the death wasn't that it was somebody I cared about. At least not more than about any other npc in the story. The important part was that she was our ace in the sleeve, our only chance against the destruction of Tyria. Be it by dragons or killing dragons.
---
Bonus: Why don't I care so much about Aurene specifically? Because she didn't have enough personality. It is possible I wasn't paying enough attention in some story parts in the past, but I can not remember anything beyond generic pet behaviour.
---
&gt; Aurene becomes the elder dragon replacement in the mists
---
Y'know I hadn't thought about it in exactly those terms, but it'd be super damn cool if it does play out like that. Anything that gets us more Mists lore is good in my book.
---
One of these comments is not like the others...
---
It's not RNG. As far as I can tell, you have to be the person who spawns the Graveling in order to get the plate when it dies.
---
The Commander has always been the bitch of all the "cool" Characters. Destiny's Edge, Trehearne, I was feeling like somebody who actually does something worthwhile for the first time when you fight Balthasar yourself in PoF. Before that you were sitting in the backrow, watching all the other guys be busy with stuff
---
No need to worry...the rewards are pretty garbage - this is coming from someone who has almost 37k AP.
---
And once the slot is full (happens to blue ones quite fast), you lose the rest. I prefer to manually do it and even be able to abort it if I accidentally initiate salvage-all.
---
Now I'm just curious if the somber "fear not this night" track at the end of the trailer was actually a track, or if it was only made for marketing purposes.
---
I won't detail it piece by piece but it's a mix of zerk, assassin and diviner with Scholar Runes and Concentration/Force sigils.
---
For the record, I think it was found out that almost all "shroud" type abilities count as Staff kills.
---
Are yu sure yur not mass murdering stuff while in Photon Forge or Shroud? 
---
Yea and it's become that again I feel like. 
---
no you didn't. all you've done is say "but they could make it hard". does making her return hard change the fact that anet would have her "dead" (which is only effective as a narrative tool  because it's supposed to **be permanent**) just for the sake of a cliffhanger? 
---
no, it doesn't.
---
if they wanted to bring aurene back they should've done it before the end of this episode instead of reducing death from a serious story implication to a mere cliffhanger for the sake of cheap drama. they should have aurene burst from the statue just to fly off with kralk or they should've have her kill Caith so she could resurrect herself as an undead abomination. not end on her cold unmoving body with a character literally saying us that "aurene is dead".
---
Don't eat yellow snow
---
That is a really nice addition. The past couple of releases I only completed those achievements i felt like, because AP rewards felt unreachable. I really miss the old days where Achievements were 5 AP minimum. Aaaand Achievement Chests could be buffed a bit as well, they really feel dated by now.
---
I have read (not confirmed or anything and haven't had the time to try it, so just in case it could have helped i'm putting it there) that some people managed to get it when you don't kill the mob right where it spawned but that it moved a bit from spawn.
---
Taimi is probably gonna be Golem'd into Scruffy's chassis.
---
I was about to say, "wasn't there an Arena net over that?"
---
Misleading in the greatest of ways.
---
Yah, saw it happened 11 Dec. For me that really sucks, burned out on Raids so right now the only thing I run my Chronos for are the Tour of HoT and 'basic glide' HP/HP&amp;MP runs and not having the third port is going to be huge. RIP helping more than 39 people at a time I guess.
---
That's how *pirate* works
---
FTFY
---
Just checked on my human male, scaling is still the same as before. Shoulder armor is awfully oversized when using the buff body.
---
For me, one major question that could use answering is: how much magic is enough?  In the past, we've been told that dragons consume magic until they're "done," and then go back to sleep. But more recent accounts seem to suggest that dragons only stop consuming magic when they run out of magic to consume.
---
So maybe this is fundamentally incorrect, but assuming there is a point at which a dragon is "full," how much is that? Surely Kralk has reached that point, right? He's got Zhaitan's, Mordremoth's, and Balthazar's magic (where Balthazar was even a notable portion of Primodus's and Jormag's magic).
---
So if we do head back to northern Ascalon, is he maybe ready to call it a night? Like Jormag and Primordus, this could be infuriating because he could bury himself too deep for us to properly attack him. BUT it does give us a chance to feel the impact of his reign and figure out an alternative from all our failed plans.
---
Pack rune boons get removed at the start of a raid.
---
If this is true you can fortunately respawn the graveling a couple of seconds after it was killed which means it could only really be an issue during peak time.
---
Man, people on this subreddit really have no idea what a Deus Ex Machina is, huh
---
Loading code and executing code are two different things. The first is text with barely any impact whatsoever, the second is where the real load lies. The art assets aren't loaded until the executed code tells them to, and if they're never told to load, they never will.
---
They're still there though, but as a short text string indicating id and coordinates, which has zero impact on the engine and the rendering process. It's completely illogical to manually edit or remove this information every time you work with a map, when you can easily turn it on and off. The artists does his thing, leaves the required flags around, and the programmer works with said flags, never touching the art himself.
---
Also, you can tell image editing programs to not load layers, or even keep them in different files, which can be loaded separately. If you do professional editing with huge files, this is the only way to work with them.
---
The car reference is a reply to your "how do you know it works like that" question.
---
I think core does a great job of teaching basics, it's just that there's no learning curve between that and the HoT content.
---
Difficulty-wise, PoF should have come first, then HoT.
---
PoF is a lot like huge silverwastes/dry top maps with most enemies that can be handled solo, provided you fight smart and don't agro too many...but with a few that are better off avoided unless you brought friends. Escape is difficult but possible, yet death is only a few bad decisions and unlucky events away at any given time. Through all this, the maps are broadly fairly simple and straightforward to navigate.
---
Contrast this to HoT where individual enemies can still often be soloed, but they usually travel in packs, enemies that can't be easily soloed are commonplace and you just have to learn which ones to fight and which to avoid. For many situations, by the time you realize things are bad, it's too late to escape, and on top of it all, the maps are a nightmare to navigate!
---
I think that a lot more people would have adapted better and faster to HoT after the experience of PoF as opposed to the order we got them. And I think that's why we're here in 2019 still seeing posts like this, while days after PoF dropped, people were commenting on how easy most of it really was.
---
Either use the warrior channel or the ask a question channel and people will chime in!
---
I always thought that story with the cut grass was referring to the aftermath of how he got his head foliage burnt off by Noll's thugs (that's when his new model was introduced)... I don't actually know if that was intentional of if I just assumed it.

Oh is the dying not part of the story? Thought it was like when you fight balthazar and then boom dead. It's wasn't death from playing. Was stood there then full health with no fighting happening then boom you were defeated and respawn option. 
---
I spawned it 30-40 times and it didn't drop until it was too late. Nobody should kill the same enemy soooo many times for something like this.
---
This is why developing an MMO sounds like an absolute nightmare and I'm kinda ready for the medium to die off. I like it when creators have fewer constraints and more creative freedom.
---
That may be, we didn't test that, but it's not intuitive. Please /u/anet_ben look into this. (pinging you because I know you like to look into weird bugs).
---
Currently it seems they only get stripped from you and not your allies, plus fights are still longer than 20-30 seconds so you could have to kickstart speed+fury with a banner (rip) for the opening and have the rune help maintain them after (because if you are not with the druid having to produce/maintain those boons can be very painful).

#Bond of Betrayal
---
it's +- 20h
---
Tried with and without shroud. Neither worked.
---
Huh...don't think we have. She would have so many questions.
---
Damn this is beautiful, your mom has some awesome skill!
---
Maybe she was scared not because she was afraid of possibly dying, but she knew she had to die in order to set in motion whatever is coming next. That is what I think.
---
I think the ending had such an impact because as others said, she was the answer to the problem. Now she is gone. So gloomy and uncertain now for the future. I like this direction.
---
So what ? What's the problem with a cliffhanger, that made everyone feel emotion and stirred up a lot of lore discussions in the community ? So what the episode ended on a high not ?
---
You're acting like it's a bad thing there's suspense. It's not.
---
I confess, I too tried it this way at first.  My only defence was that I had limited playtime and was rushing.  Did not think it through.
---
Plenty of others have given the correct solution.  So Just to add, in future, just ask people on map chat, rather than spending two days letting it sap your hype.  I was helped out by a very tolerant Commander who gave me the heads up when I exclaimed on Map chat.  It was an embarrassing realisation.
---
Did you miss the whole Scion and Champion instance?  We're the ones who can help Aurene channel her energy.
---
Caithe losing her flowers was impactful because she only gained them from letting Aurene brand her.
---
Commander just woke up from a concussion and is traumatized by both failure and loss of an ally.  Probably magical trauma too as we're bonded to Aurene.
---
God from the machine, a Latin translation of a Greek theatrical device were an actor playing as a deity entered the stage by descending from above with the help of a machine and brought the solution to the problem or completely changed the plot
---
He stole enough magic to send Primordus,a Dragon 3 times Kralkatorrik s size,and Jormag,a dragon who bitchslapped the entire Norn race,both to sleep without causing any downside. We had to go and destroy the machine he used for that.
---
thanks!
---
It's clear they're looking for ways to increase retention; to keep players invested in new maps for longer than a couple of days.  Thing is, they managed to do this indirectly with Aurora and ascended trinkets in LWS3, but LWS4 seems to be experimenting with other concepts - which is fine, though the design decisions made for LWS4 metas, collections, events, and content have me wondering what lessons they'll learn and what they'll apply to future expansions and episodes.
---
GW2 should have tons more death though, we've been at war with natural disasters for years.
---
One thing that gets me with the whole mists theory is how is Aurene any different than Glint if she is alive in the mists? 
---
You need leyline gliding maxed to purchase the Gift of Gliding anyway, so this is entirely pointless.
---
I'll just say this: GW2 is a company with good writers and mediocre developers and economists.
---
The company just doesn't listen to us. The last season shows that no matter the quality of the story they make they find a way to screw up the fun of the current map. How they are naive enough not to learn from stuff they've had to patch in the past is beyond understandable, and they might keep doing it as long as they have a loyal fanbase to lick their boots every time they crap out anything and they're ready to defend them for the most minuscule things.
---
40!?  That's only quickness though, not alacrity.  Also, most people do not have full +9 infusions to get the extra 6% BD.  If you are in fractals with double well you will be looking at:
---
* 10% from Firebrand runes (40% for Quickness)
---
* 10% from Sigil of Conc
---
* 6.7% from food
---
* 15% from pots
---
That's only about 42% BD.  For Quickness it is 72% BD.  Tides of Time has a 24s cooldown with alacrity (assuming you get the 10s reduction) and gives 2.84s Alacrity with the BD.  SoI extends that by 5s every 24s and Well of Recall gives 7.1s of Alacrity every 24s.  That gives you: 2.84+7.1+5 = \~14.94s.  That's only about 15 seconds of Alacrity every 24 seconds which is not enough.  If you are using IA, the cooldowns for Tides, Well and SoI would all be 15s instead which means you have absolutely zero margin of error there.
---
In reality, taking some Diviner's pieces to get you more concentration is much more preferred than having a razor thin margin for keeping up 100% Alacrity.
---
Even if you had the 6% BD from infusions it would be 15.36 seconds of Alacrity which is also a very small margin for any error.  If you have to dodge a mechanic or res someone or whatnot you will easily drop Alacrity.  In Raids, you have an extra 5 seconds on top of that from the other Chrono which amounts to almost 19 seconds of Alacrity every 15 seconds.  With IA that is enough and gives you almost 4 seconds for dodging/mechanics as opposed to 0.36 seconds.  Still very small.
---
To give you some breathing room, taking more Diviner's gear and pushing your BD higher is better than dropping Alacrity.
---
nothing if they keep her dead.
---
the current suspense is "what do we do now that aurene is dead aka gone for good?" which is good. but if we bring her back it's aney going "tricked you you just have to get her back to full strenght again" so they could pretend the stakes in the story where higher then they actually were. 
---
which is just shitty writing.
---
She will eventually waypoint, 'cause commanders always yell at fully dead, lul.
---
This, thanks for doing it.
---
Sure, but they never said it would be anytime soon at all, they said it would be at some point in the future. While to OP claimed that they would add it shortly after the festival, which is clearly not at all what they said. 
---
Maybe I see it differently, but I have a hard time attaching meaning, to character death in the Guildwars Universe. We're in a magical universe, depending on the nature of that magic and the afterlife, there is no point in attaching meaning to death.
---
Also, you mention overused trope a lot. Remember that over, or underuse depend on the setting and the context within it, its internal consistency, just as much, if not more so, than its external consistency. And the externally consistent work that comes to mind when I think of GW and its sequel is Dungeons and Dragons. In DnD we have access to spells like True Resurrection, where you can bring back the dead from 200 years ago, provided they are willing. So as far as I'm concerned, bringing important partymembers back from the dead is internally and externally consistent with the story that is being told. 
---
As for arcs getting undermined, I was glad we had our closure moment with Eir, where she told her baby norn that she couldn't have been what he wanted. He's too stubborn to work that out on his own. It also showed that the increase in ambient magic is weakening the border between the Mists and Tyria, showing the damage Kralkatorrik is doing to the World. And Braham's fit wasn't great to begin with. Not that Eir's death was good either.
---
As for Zojja, I'm afraid she's dead. Snaff might have alluded to that already. Would explain her absence and inaction.
---
As for good game writing, I'd argue two things: 
---
One, you can't approach game writing in the same way as you'd write a novel. 
---
Two, that nothing can kill your story quite like excessive character death.   
---
These characters keep the player, or reader in the written medium engaged. Even if all their deaths are perfectly executed and meaningful, the audience will experience fatigue and no longer care. In a novel, that's too bad, because it marks the end of the series, bad guys win, I guess. Hovever, the context of video games is way more lenient with gamey concepts like 'extra lives', 'powerups', 'respawns' etc. This actually makes traditionally "good" writing "bad" in a videogame context and vice versa. (Barring TPKs and such.)
---
In Final Fantasy VII, Aeris' death scene was good novel writing, but bad game writing. In the game you could revive dead characters, but now the plot demands she stay dead? This lead to gameplay and story segregation and the publisher had to explain it away, claiming your characters were not "truly" dead, despite the game showing "dead" (older titles, not to mention resurrection spell, which makes no sense to use on K.O. characters) when your character got blasted away. 
---
Might and Magic did it better, the game acknowledged that reviving magic exists and your party is among the privileged to use it extensively, but others are not so lucky. Also, you could bribe the corrupt grim reaper, which was acknowledged in a Heroes III campaign.
---
In the context of our game story it is natural that we need to get Aurene back. Again, this follows the theme of your RPG table, where the party paladin got killed by a Blackguard. The party took the Blackguard down, but at that moment everyone was just shocked, that the paladin went down.
---
And finally, sorry for the pulp comment, It's clear that you just have different tastes and we agree on many points. But I disagree that every death must be a novel death.
---
Think he would have been better off spending the 1-1.5 hours getting mastery points for ley line gliding.
---
&gt; So why is the notion that GW2 is in maintenance so retarded for mobile in particular? 
---
I'll literally repeat my own question because it does pick up on the issue at hand.  
---
&gt; Right now we're at you're complaining about how you never participated at the issue at hand. 
---
Right now you are avoiding replying to my questions related to the issue at hand. This is because you're unable to read and unable to form coherent arguments related to "the issue at hand" or anything else for that matter. 
---
As soon as your points of view are challenged you're the person who repeatedly avoids discussing the topic through actual arguments, logic or reason. 
---
In not one of the last 4 posts have you told us /why/ the issue at hand is retarded. I have meme'd and seriously posed questions and reasonings as to why I disagree. You still haven't defended yourself. You still haven't explained your point of view. 
---
In fact, you only stated that in order to believe these things you need to be on drugs, put the misinformation into rectum, have to be clinically retarded, ... Yet you're rambling about how I never participated. I'm afraid you yet again confirm the only retarded thing in this entire discussion is you. 
---
I don't have a male character to preview it on. But Lunatic Noble outfit is the closest thing to a suit I could find under medium armor that wasn't an outfit. Maybe Lunatic Noble Coat; Noble, Rascal or Rogue Pants; Duelist Boots; and maybe Mask of the Jubilee for the head. 
---
So simple, yet so helpful. I was just thinking the day before that it'd be nice to have an account-wide search feature for any given item (as someone with way too many bank chars...) as well, but this is an even better idea! I'd love it if it could also say if a specific character has something too.
---
half a second...
---
I had the same bug yesterday. I didnt drop the plate from the mob but I had luck that the room was the last before the treasure room. So a friend could port me into the treasure room and I could loot the Big box. Dont know if this also works when the bugged room is not the last one.
---
One Question: which class do you play? I played power chrono. I have a feeling it is buggy cause of the illusions.
---
You know that the item isnt looted from the dead mob but it drops it on the ground, right?
---
Is it? I mean sure it'll continue to run for another 5-10 years without a doubt. But GW1 is running and still has a dev on it but i wouldn't call it "alive" much less say it has a future. 
---
If the community of the game has given up on growth or even sustaining their current population, and anet themselves do the same and move on to a next project, what future do you see? Stalled out decadence is a given, but it's not what i'd call a future. 
---
Don't do hearts, they suck. Seriously do the dynamic events and poi/vista/WPs when you're by them. Hearts are more markers of where dynamic events start and map completion fill in stuff than efficient leveling tools.  If you're trying to level like WoW where you just do quests it will take you forever to level. 
---
I don't think Glint would have sent her child to her death. Why would Anet go out of their way to make Ogden act like Joko dying was needed before we faced Kralkatorrik. I believe its because Glint being prophetic knew Aurene would need to face Kralkatorrik. That why I think Ogden mentioning Joko was to hint that Aurene can't die in a sense maybe if Kralky eats her. Obviously this is a theory of mine.
---
And what do you have to do to drop it?
---
Haven't raided since around the release of the Hall of Chains, because the person who was basically our raid leader went MIA.  
---
Haven't explored that wing much (Only did restore the statues I think) and not touched Mythwright Gambit at all. Would love to have a go at them.  
---
Still a handful of LI away from legendary armor though, so the others are cool too (EU).
---
...this episode.
---
Conditempest, 30stacks of burning and close to none phisical damage.
---
Will pay more to keep her dead. First right thing they did in a long time
---
I am forever wanting pictures and posters from the game, but my resolution and screenshots are so poor. This just makes me envious and want it more, lol.
---
Their*
---
You can bounce in Mistlock Sanctuary. :)
---
Ok so its not a problem with Chrono. Thx
---
The strange thing was: A friend helped me and he got the plate after the first kill. AND he saw another plate on the ground after the third kill. But I never got it in like 8 or 9 tries. The drop rate is soo strange
---
I started playing Assassin's Creed because I wanted to play an action game with templars.
---
Please stop killing all the templars :(
---
Nope. I honestly expected to die what with sitting inside aoes while blind. But I just went out of combat after some time and cutscene started.
---
If your goal is "playing with your guild", then that won't last forever either because most guilds require somewhat regular players. And the more of these spread out over different games, the less reason for the remaining players to log in and have fun. Further accelerates how there is nothing to do. 
---
LS is designed ot not require any interaction, coordination, teamwork or gameplay. You just go in and win! You're not going to get communities like you had for drytop or TT or DS because you literally have no need for them. 
---
Plenty of other content does promote playing together as groups... But all this content is "on the table". 
---
If your goal is raids, then once you're done you can quit safely for an entire year before anything changes. Or you can do monday clears once a week until you get tired of those. And trust me - statics are burning out of doing the same raid wings every monday for 2-3 years. 
---
If your goal is WvW then you'd better love roaming or karma training in circles for no reason.
---
Because challenging fights are rare and far in between. Good matchups are rare and far in between. Healthy communities... hihi xD. Caring about PPT? Yeah that'd require a community with a goal. Many GvG guilds don't have enough enemies and competition to keep going. And why would they? No balance, no fucks given by anet, community would prefer to tell them to go play GW1 and how IT'S AN EVENT IN LORE!!! than consider people might enjoy it. 
---
PvP ... Yeah anyone suprised there aren't many pvp guilds? High end PvP dead. Low end pvp is literally a bot farm. Meta is more static than chess and that game doesn't even get updates... Oh wait chess is balanced. MY BAD. 
---
GW2 is a singleplayer where people pretend pressing 1 in the vicinity of other players' glow counts as "interaction". Repeatable content and diversity was removed to cater to only one subgroup of players, and the game will continue to lose players (including the "target audience") because of it. 
---
That would be an extra.
---
I meant having a new [upgrade or power up](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_Super_Adventure_Box_upgrades_and_skills) you can grab to ride a mount, inside the SAB.
---
Oh wierd really don't know what happened then because there didn't seem to be any mechanics happening that I saw. Will see what happens when I run next char through
---
Poor little Joko. He was so young!
---
More DPS Chronos.
---
What am I supposed to be looking at? That ugly fashion sense?
---
It's purely for the sake of numbers, obviously your build at any given moment is going to have to adapt to the current situation. This build exists because there are scenarios where it's feasible to have 100% slow uptime, but it's well known that this build is only for those scenarios.
---
&gt; It's entire ~~RNG~~ broken.
---
You spelled that wrong, so I fixed it. ;)
---
EU or NA?
---
I went into the cave, ran all the way to the end and there is a cave in. I checked the wiki and its apparently part of the final stage of the meta, where you fight a big devourer.
---
I couldn't find any other way into that PoI and the wiki even says the meta often gets stuck. So I just abandoned it, I've gone there every day since (10+ days) and its still broken, only in a different way since the patch.
---
the principle of *failing* an event first in order to gain a certain *achievement* is absurd and kind of contradictory.
---
PMed.
---
That is clearly a perfect Sam Elliot
---
It can happen. PMed!
---
It's really tiresome. It's obvious some of the developers haven't gotten the memo about this yet.
---
*After 6 whole years.*
---
You'll be fine. PMed!
---
It's not often I get to let people know on Reddit The pure facts about an item however the arena show 2 mini pets  battling because originally when the game was coming out there was a mini pet battling system where many pets would be used to fight other players and NPCs in a Pokemon Style battle it was unfortunately scrapped slightly before release because of technical issues and majorly World of Warcraft recently had an update that had pet battles I'm not 100% sure if the code works still but when the game came out there was codes that you could copy and paste in the chat to Ping a mini pet battle item that let you register many pets as part of their team another item to let you challenge players it sounded like an amazing concept and early on me and a bunch of Guild members all heavily requested it as a feature to come out since poly mock didn't seem to be returning this is some really odd random thing that I was always super interested in and not many people know about.
---
to be fair its still a guild war between the commanders guild vs the elder dragons guild if you think about it
---
&gt;This is why developing an MMO sounds like an absolute nightmare and I'm kinda ready for the medium to die off. I like it when creators have fewer constraints and more creative freedom.
---
If the developpers were creative in solving the issues the genre wouldn't be dying. 
---
On release GW2 had lots of revolutionary features found nowhere else in the genre. 
---
In the last 3 years, they've done quite a few things /well/ but I don't think they've done anything revolutionary, innovative or creative in terms of gameplay / quality of life / ... and many of the earlier innovations were lost. 
---
e.g. base game had stuff like no gear treadmill, standardized pvp, high degree of freedom for fashion, lots of quality of life features such as material storage, salvaging, fully-shared loot and gathering nodes, account bound fashion and gear unlocks, hearts, unlockable waypoints... 
---
Since HoT they did what? Add stronghold as a failed moba-copy/pasta? Add mounts which by all means are done well, but literally exist in every other game. Hell they didn't even account how mounts affected other games when introduced later, seeing the issues how the maps now are huge, look nice but have much lower gameplay density. Powercreep elite specialisations that do very little "unique" and very much "do more at once"? Many elite specs aren't even "new unique way of playing X" but rather "core class on steroids". 
---
And then there's deadeye - which has a unique way of playing and hteme to it. Sniper thief. So original. Much wow. Extra funny because it's impossible to balance for all three gamemodes. Nice creative design.
---
You can argue for creativity in the story line, that's fair. But gameplay / mechanic wise? I don't know what creativity you're talking about. They don't even have the creativity to think of fairly obvious game-changing build / trait / ... interactions when they do balances, probably because they don't play their game. 
---
I find it kind of hilarious that this:
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that prevented players from selecting &lt;new stat combo&gt; stats for some ascended items.
---
was in all LW hotfixes since S3E4 (Seraphs). You'd think they expect it by now...
---
Creating this post took maybe 3 minutes and can be done from anywhere with a crappy laptop.
---
I wouldn't say not worth it. The current chest dropped the Advanced Leather rack from 800g on the TP to a little over 200g. So they do good. 
---
You create retention with good repeatable content, not shitty timegates.
---
Look at dungeons. It took a long time to get all the weapon and armor skins, but the content itself was fun and had a lot of replayability.
---
You can buy the item that gets you through the door, or a Mesmer can portal you in (I assume). It's not *directly* locked behind the meta, just some tradable items that come from the meta.
---
Browsing Reddit on the toilet at work is much easier than playing GW2 on the toilet at work.
---
This map has done what GW2 has rarely done (and usually fixed fairly quickly) - made me not want other people around. You need people to finish the 2 Metas to get the Plate Halves, but after that, they're a nuisance. 
---
Either let everyone get a Plate when Graveling is part of the daily rotation, or shut off the timer on LoD so I don't get stiffed in the last room because I had to wait 15 minutes to get the Graveling's Plate.
---
Reading comprehension.
---
I don’t have time to really sit down and play the story until the weekend because of prior commitments. Yet I still have 15 min here and there to spend on Reddit.
---
I’m not here to complain.  But the meme posted resonates with me because I find it funny that that movie is exactly how I’ve been treating the sub so far since the patch.
---
Eh, I think a lot of us saw it coming. It' like having a dog in a movie. Pupper is doomed. 
---
Woah, I really fucking wish, my parents would be into games. 
---
Maybe he is glad there are spoiler tags in the first place.
---
Op isn’t complaining, someone is just projecting their assumptions.
---
It also sucks how all the characters kept calling her evil and she was never accepted until she died. Very heartbreaking.
---
Same. I think that Kralk is too injured to be able to go into the mists now, so he probably retreated too his resting place to heal. 
---
So are you Boy, Girl, or Malorie?
---
This is pretty epic. I am happy to see your parents have a passion they share 
---
This is my favorite comment of the morning.
---
At what % slow uptime does danger time become better than improved alacrity?
---
I'm really not sure how to estimate this, but from weekly clear logs, I see between 40% and 75% slow uptime depending on the boss. No renegade or chronos with slow trait in these cases.
---
I'm not sure when to be swapping this trait other than when I want a CS off-CD earlier for split phases.
---
There were plans for a pokemon style minipet battle. It was never implemented, even incompletely, to any public version of the game. The name of that battle activity was Polymock.
---
Anet wouldn't not do Polymock because of WoW. It existed in GW1, though that didn't use miniatures.
---
&gt; I'm thinking this is unlikely because the information from Arah has not mattered since the very beginning
---
Then this is a great time to use it. Think back to both Arah and our free chicken, and Siren's Landing; unbound undead, and now Awakened, are common lore, but that element hasn't ever been used *strategically* in the story.
---
From Wiki
---
&gt; The Ritual of Purification was an act performed by Trahearne to cleanse the Artesian Waters of Zhaitan's corruption. 
---
I guess we can scratch that
---
...did you just agree with everything?
---
sooo... you're saying you don't like aurora?
---
does anyone know where can i see a image of how the fully built nest from this achievement looks? [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Good,\_Better,\_Nest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Good,_Better,_Nest)  the videos ive found dont show it after getting all the gifts, i would do the achiv myself to get it but im still kinda in the post effects of the last ls chapter so not really felling into it.
---
Personal theory: During the trials, Glint tells you about Kralk's prophecy. Meanwhile, Glint is "explaining things about Ascension that are easier shared between dragons". I think Aurene had to die, as she foresaw, in order to "Ascend" in the mists and truly take Kralk's place. Other supporting line from Glint: "What she must do will seem impossible to her. You must carry hope for her"
---
oh it changes the area during an event? Well, the more you know. I was extremely confused there for a second \^\^ 
---
Not that one, I'm talking about one of the Arah paths where we purify a Risen Chicken 
---
After I finished the episode I wanted to go kill every Branded being in existence.  Every one of them!!  Shatterer? DEAD!  Death Branded Shatterer? Super Dead!  Random Branded Ogre?  Oh, you know it's dead.  I will mount Kralkatorrik's head on my (extremely large) wall!!
---
Please tell me it was normal bunny sized.
---
It doesn't matter, since all things you can craft are account bound on acquisition.
---
If you have a crafting license so each character can have 3 available at the same time, it was actually better to have all 3 armors in 1 character, and all 3 armors in another, since each group shared many recipes between the other 2. 
---
Now that all non-discoverable recipes are account bound, it doesn't matter that much for armor, but for weapons it's still better, since you may want to craft a weapon set for a new character, and having all 3 in one character would allow you to craft weapons from all 3 weapon disclines without having to switch characters.
---
Thanks! This is a ton of useful information.  Points (9) and (10) seem like things I would never have discovered on my own.
---
Right now I'm full exotic beserker's with GS + Sword/Focus. I'm using the Radiant Greatsword build from metabattle. I feel like Sword2 is great for the blind/teleport and Sword3 is nice for having a bit of range (though the root sucks).  Is Scepter significantly better?  It seems more ranged, which I think would be helpful.  On Chrono, I use GS + Sword/Shield and alternate between melee and ranged and really like that style of play.
---
How important is ascended gear?  Most of what I've read said it isn't really a requirement until later fractals and I don't have any ascended stuff on my Chrono, though Chrono is loaded with active defense.  It might be interesting to work towards this just to have something different to do and getting a GS would be useful on both my characters.
---
Great arguments. 
---
In reality, unlike all these monkeys saying "all mmo's die after 5 years except wow" I think GW2 has a huge amount of "potential". I really did enjoy the game and i still do on certain occasions. I don't hate the game. 
---
What I really dislike is the direction it is going / has been going. I highly doubt i'm alone in this sentiment. Watch teatime and they'll discuss exactly this for 1-2 hours straight literally every week. 
---
So why do they keep discussing it? Clearly they must all /hate/ the game! Except they don't. They LOVE the game and they HATE how the game (and huge parts of its community) are neglected. And so much as voicing your opinion about it will repeatedly get you told "fuck you, stop playing, play something else, you and your prefered playstyle are bad and not welcome".
---
If I really hated the game, I wouldn't bother. What I hate is how unless you're hypercasual, you're not welcome in this game. That's why I'll happily fight toxicity with toxicity. 
---
I'd love to come home, log into the game and be able to just jump in and have fun. Frankly i'd not bother posting on reddit and just play. 
---
So I log in. 
---
I'll go into WvW. There won't be any enemies. No really. The only chance at enemies is by asking a few select groups if they'll be willing to go fight in EOTM because I know for a fact that there won't be anything in my matchup. So I'll talk to some people and see if we can /force/ content by avoiding 90% of WvW and bypassing matchups by going into EOTM just to be able to play as we enjoy.
---
I'll look onto the raid LFG. I'll be rather dead with 9/10 groups looking for chrono. Do I want to raid that badly to join an 8/10 pug raid that is looking for 2 chronos? I guess not. 
---
I'll ask in 3 different raid statics if people want to raid. The vast majority of players wont' log in. I say they're raid statics but none of them actually raids every monday... Because literally all of them struggle to have 10 players every monday after having the wings on farm for years. On a good day, we'll be 5-8 players and we'll do some meme raids. 
---
I'd queue for pvp OH JUST KIDDING IT'S OFF SEASON. PvP is complete garbage - if you thought high end games were dead before wait until you try unranked during the off-season. 
---
So yeah I guess I hate the game... Nothing to do with literally no updates to pretty much all content outside of LS during entire 2018, and pretty much ever since PoF... Making "fun interaction" more and more rare.
---
I don't hate the game. I hate how the community insists "everyone can play how they like" yet they demand everyone plays as casual as they do... I hate how anet has become disconnected from huge aspects of their own dedicated fanbase, and lost those very players because of it. 
---
tl dr : People upset with anet / the game in its current state don't hate the game; they care about the game and are sad to see the state it is in. These are very different things, and continuously ignoring this feedback won't help. 
---
Character selection screen and guild roster. 
---
There's also the Forgotten path in the Arah dungeon, where we liberate a chicken's will as a proof of concept. In theory the [Altar of Glaust](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Altar_of_Glaust) should be capable of freeing dragon-slaved minions from more than just Zhaitan's control.
---
I also think this is a great time to use it, I'm just doubting that they will.
---
Screw that. I'm staying in Denial until next chapter.
---
Yeah, my expectation is "something something time travel, something something The Mists" instead.
---
The price will probably start fall during the weekend when when the majority of the player base gets to try the new map.
---
But she only just learnt how to talk (through a surrogate) if she's done that a few episodes ago, then she would have had way more obvious personality.
---
Thanks, I like the Bitterfrost idea.
---
Missed a "not".
---
Oh, I only did each path once for the achievement long ago. Nevermind then.
---
I didnt miss anything, but it doesnt feel consistent. I felt 0 emotion from the commander. Just "well darn" at best. I did not enjoy the emphasis on caith, why not my commander since shes a sylvari? What's so special about caith? 
---
 Nothing really seems impactful, and the story is too short. Time to wait another 5-6 months for a brief follow up. 
---
They've already tried changing his mind, his hunger is too strong that he is pretty much a mindless hungry hurricane.
---
&gt;Snaff stared at his reflection in the compound eye of the beast—stared so long that he passed through the reflection and found himself on the other side...
---
&gt;Within the dragon's mind.
---
&gt;It was like standing in the eye of a cyclone. All around, a great storm raged, tearing down the heavens and churning up the sands and whirling all in primordial chaos. Tortured coils of cloud mixed with dissolving seas of silt. The winds scoured away rock and rill, tree and blade, flesh and bone—and tossed them all in a crystalline tempest.
---
&gt;All things were fuel to that storm.
---
&gt;Everything was a feast to Kralkatorrik.
---
&gt;How does one fight a hurricane?
---
&gt;But only now did he understand.
---
&gt;The center of every vortex is a great emptiness—a hollow longing. &gt;The storm tries to fill the emptiness, but the more it hungers, the deeper the emptiness becomes.
---
&gt;And Kralkatorrik's hunger was insatiable.
---
Removed: Low effort / Low value post. Also, that's what the [no spoiler](https://qq.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/) filter is for.

Aurene = Dr Stephen Strange 
---
Sincerely your Commander, T Stark
---
It feels like unlocking single ascended weapon will take a month for me (one meta a day, depending on when I get online, three jewels for just exotic one, a giant pile of essences), so I'll just skip it :(
---
Hopefully some people will be able to complete it before it becomes hard "only first meta after reset succeeds" abandoned land
---
What ofc your phantasms gain the banner buffs
---
Nope next episode we'll find out there truly is no hope and we die too, then announcement for *GW3: Unbranded* which takes place 250 years in the future in a post apocalyptic world with only a few survivors who don't know of the world that isn't branded.
---
Aww man good call. To bad you can't edit titles. 
---
so? which is the trick ? i crafted it long ago but was just curious. or is this just a wisper bait ? 
---
Considering she was part of Kralky's army in the past and how well she can put her words in our heads and the heads of others, she can use chaos magic, which has a lot to do with mind.  
---
Same as a mesmer can create clones, control other creatures minds and more, Glint can too but on a much greater scale as her magic capacity is higher as well.  
---
In other words, being in one place while sending a piece of her own mind/conceousness doesn't sound too hard for such a being.  
---
The way the journal was written, it feels and sounds more like Glint is currently doing this, especially since she let us know that she knows the original spear was destroyed. Meaning, even if it was a recording, it was recorded after we destroyed the spear.
---
Oh my god that would be so funny
---
and nothing will happen.
---
follow my advice : pvp is just a minigame u can do to get some money and the wings. maybe the armor and weapons . nothing more.
---
You break out of the map, find a tiny hole above the mastery, and then glide down. I can't describe how to do it here and i didn't make a video. If you want more than this comment, i can party you in game and show you if you're NA.
---
Right now, it appears that whoever triggers the event is the one that gets the plate; if there is a mob of people in the room and someone parks on the coffin spamming 'F', there's no way you're moving on to the next room. Meanwhile, your LoD buff is ticking down. 
---
People *could* organize, and portal people into the last room, but there's still a choke point where a single person can delay the whole group.
---
I genuinely think this might be possible
---
That’s awesome - I’ve actually considered changing MY Mez to be ‘group-friendly’ this way to help with HPs as well, but know I’m not nearly learned enough in the specifics of the points (yet) to even consider leading a group. I’ll probably take notes watching how you handle things though, if that’s OK... 
---
no ty i   did astralaria yet . 
---
I respectfully disagree as there have been memes posted to our sub that were of even lower effort (not even ms paint editing, they pulled an image from an image hosting website) and used only a title and were left up even after having been reported.
---
The way the choir swells when you channel during the Kralkatorrik fight is liquid hype.
---
Honestly, I prefer the previous fractal a lot more to this one in terms of the story it tells. Weyandt is an established character, sure, but he's not exactly impactful and we've seen pirate curses before. Had we known the background that Dessa was describing (i.e. that he was heroic or something) only to find out he was quite twisted, maybe it would have been more interesting, but we really just find it out during the fractal. I guess my complaint is that the whole story basically starts and ends with the fractal. In Deepstone the characters themselves aren't that important, but the dwarven secrets were very interesting and left room for a lot of speculation. 
---
This is all just personal opinion though, but I like fractal stories most when they either (a) are something kinda' vague and interesting but leave lots of room to speculate (e.g. Deepstone, Uncategorized, Cliffside), or (b) visit a story beat that we're actually quite familiar with but either give us a different angle to it that we haven't seen or reveal something more (e.g. Urban Battleground, Twilight Oasis). 
---
As for the rest of the fractal (gameplay, music, environment), I definitely enjoyed myself and overall think it's a success. 
---
Not really, do you earnestly believe that the current model of content delivery is enough to sustain long term players and bring new players in?
---
It's basically a prefect recipe for decreasing the population.
---
Those actually need to remain as inventory items due to how they interact with the SAB - changing them to a currency would break most, if not all, of the things that interact with them, possibly in ways that are difficult or impossible to fix.
---
They actually did say that it was planned, but they didn't have time for it last year. I personally wouldn't expect them to be added before this year's Festival, although I could be wrong.
---
So I was lurking here because I seriously have no idea either and I am still waiting on Guides how to manage to do that.   
---
The 30 Kills were no problem for me today. I've done them earlier with my Condi Mesmer (Axe Mainhand) and all 30 Mobs I killed were counting right away.  
---
What I cant seem to manage to do so far (I didnt try long so far though) was the 20 seconds waiting for killing mobs. How did you do this one ?  
---
And then the 10% health.... Ive been tryin that yesterday and... Idk... it's so little health that until I reach it and would be able to kill the mobs, that they are already hitting me to death then. Idk what anet is thinking doing such quests for this weapon?!
---
The map challenges seem to be there to encourage the practice with the new mastery, with some creativity and practice it seems to open up new ways to get around. Although I'm sure there will be even more arbitrary challenges in future releases (unless it becomes like the beetle doors that didn't show up in this map).
---
That's awesome!
---
The drop rate needs to be fixed or this item could be tradable. Farmed both metas and chest and didn't get any of those items.
---
Well they said they can feel something similar to zhaitans magic in kralkatorrik
---
&gt; I felt 0 emotion from the commander.
---
Yeah, that's typical of shock.
---
&gt; What's so special about caith?
---
You're doing a really poor job convincing me that you paid attention to the previous instances...  Caithe's connection to Aurene is from when she raised her in the exalted temple.
---
&gt; do you know the com has a concussion?
---
We're dealt enough physical abuse to black out, and upon waking up our vision is tunneled and our hearing is poor.  Yes, we have experienced a concussion.
---
You may not have experienced a tragedy similar to what we see at the end of the story, but the gamut of reactions that ANet portrayed is realistic.  Some people scream and cry, some look for blame, some isolate themselves, and others (like the Commander) shut down.
---
It's a shame, I love reading lishtenbird temper tantrums. Some of the most entertaining content on this sub tbh
---
I don't know why you're being downvoted for speaking the truth.  AP rewards are a joke to long time players. 5g for what is essentially amounts to months of work? Fuck off. If they want me to care about ap they need to buff the rewards substantially. I haven't cared about ap since I got my radiant chest piece. 
---
Sure! And if you are playing on EU servers, I can give you some time with me on the maps, to see what I do and what you'd do. Learning from each others etc. :).
---
I came here to comment "that looks like sam elliot"
---
Until i zoomed in....its harrison ford, with a smirk.
---
Please ANet, just make Tiktak an actual npc. 
---
How long does it take for customer support to reply? I got a sudden itch to play GW2 again, after a couple of years off, but I forgot my password and character name. Got the serial number of my copy but I need a character name to recover my password. :(
---
Understandable, but this is something we're working to remedy. We don't catch them all, and we are revisiting our rules to have a more clearly defined stance on memes in general.
---
It's worth noting that this was one report away from being automatically removed anyways. 
---
I’d suggest you play it if you have an extra char slots it’s really fun it does a great damage with the soldiers gear I got from the lvl 80 boost I imagine it does a insane damage with berserkers gear, and even better as a condi renegade. The energy and upkeep mechanics are very fun as well
---
you can pause though o.o
---
If I remember correctly, it's still the same people working together in the same groups; the main difference is that rather than being three distinct teams they are now one team split into three parts, allowing for easier communication, better planning and more efficient resource-sharing. It's really more of an organisational change than anything else, but it should still be beneficial in the long run.
---
don't forget to unequip your backpack
---
Yup, that's the main one that came to mind. Of course, only people who played the PS on a human will experience that (assuming they didn't skip over dialogue out of not caring). I think there's a handful of other events that touch on pirate curses, since it's a pretty common idea wherever there are pirates.
---
I definitely don't mind this kind of story by any means, I just feel it's not as interesting as some dark "shadow creatures" with some unknown language that the dwarves fought off. Using the Light of Deldrimor was also a much bigger "wow" moment for me than seeing Weyandt because we used that light back in Guild Wars 1. 
---
actually true, my numbers are slightly higher above 50% - but as you  can see, i havent at all spend too much time making this, i'm sorry &gt;&lt; i think 20k should be doable even without fear though :)
---
Or you try to avoid :P
---
That’s what I ran while I did PoF HP but instead of the staff I used the hammer to tag mobs at range 
---
&gt; added shortly after the Festival of the Four Winds

Never promised.

Lore condensed to an espresso:
---
-Magic bad, titans bad, chaos, destruction
---
-Elder races seal magic
---
-Peace, prosperity, world has a future
---
-Enter the human gods
---
-Humans spread like an infestation
---
-Greedy god unleashes magic
---
-Magic goes buckwild as humans suddenly get a massive weapon
---
-Three world wars (speaking figuratively, the three guild wars events)
---
-Magic resealed (seals dubbed bloodstones)
---
-Mankind in anarchy, god falls, pretty much big problem.
---
-God sealed, little bit of magic unsealed, elder dragons shaken, not stirred.
---
Being creative isn't easy. Neither is innovation in a business with huge initial development costs and where the effects of your choices are only felt several years after. 
---
That doesn't mean the genre isn't sustainable. When MOBA's were warcraft mods they said the same... And then moba's blew up. 
---
You say someone would be doing it yet... Howmany western mmo's have we seen in the last say 10 years? You can mentoin eastern ones too if they're not strictly P2W ;). 
---
MMORPGs as we know them can die, don't much care. Frankly that's the natural response when businesses don't innovate as much as their competition, and right now mmo's have been very stagnant compared to shooters and action style games. 
---
I don't think there is suddenly not going to be an audience for immersive multiplayer worlds. This theme tends to speak to people, both before games were a thing and it will continue. Personally I think the complexity of mmorpgs make them more difficult to grasp and market - but it's also one of their strengths.
---
Need to know who inspired 30 skritt indeed.
---
Well when I did it the first time I didn't even have to kill it to get the plate.

Removed: Please keep discussion about bugs contained to the [Bug Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/adx8ul/patch_bug_thread_8_january_2019/). There is already a discussion about this there. 
---
Nah fam, she full Pepsi
---
Gorrik and Blish are also ex-Inquest.  More friends!
---
I got achievement with my backpack on though.
---
There are at least a few events outside of the metas, although the number isn't huge by any means. It definitely is one of the less content-dense maps, which I find odd considering how big the patch was - my gut feeling is that there's more to this release than meets the eye, although I don't have any proof to back that up.
---
Agree, the story was great, but the fight itself was lame.  If you're going to point me where you want me to look and make success only a matter of going to a particular point in a particular order without any way to vary things a bit, then just make it a cut scene.  If it's a fight, stay out of it and let me lose a few times and figure out how to beat the damn thing.
---
There was a sarcastic comment from a Dev responding to a comment asking "is this the last episode", and he replied "is it?"
---
I read it in Joko's creepy voice
---
But it's so juicy!
---
And why are you telling us this?
---
There are two types of illusions, clones and phantasms
---
Phantasms are the high damage dealing ones from skills like phantasmal defender, phantasmal swordsman, etc.
---
Clones are the super low damage dealing ones that you use to set off shatter skills
---
Phantasms come with a particular skill, and they use their skill, for however long that duration is, and then they die and are replaced with clones
---
Signet of Illusions summons clones, and will not touch your phantasms 
---
Yea. I think deepstone has more world building lore than sirens reef, but the new one is still pretty fun and has some funny bits to it. Its cool to see weydant as the cabin boy lol.
---
no, but mine doesn't have plaguedoctors either so they might be based on when you get it
---
My least favorite is in bloodtide coast with the pirate event. There's a vista and HP you can't get when the meta is down, and it's a slog to finish. So much so I literally moved all of my characters to get them last time the event was done, so I wouldn't have to repeat that again for a long time.
---
I'm afraid. Snargle needs a hug.
---
a few days generally, I'd estimate ~2, maybe 3 max.
---
As long as you provided as much information as possible (the serial number really helps), they can likely give you back your account information. 
---
You can only have three _clones_ up at any time. Phantasms are unlimited, and all phantasms turn into a one 
---
The signet you are 
---
Thanks! 
---
They've removed direct and indirect failure requirements all over the place. However it takes a long time and new ones constantly slip in.
---
I love this so much. 
---
Yes, there have been occasional sales on unlimited tools. Only Anet knows when the next sale will be though
---
/u/that_shaman Do you intent to extract the new model for a direct comparison?
---
I did not register that it's Steve Blum. Thank you. That guy is a legend. 
---
To answer your creation, yes I'm in the same boat. I've done all you said, + quite a few legendaries, I've tried raids, I've done a lot of fractals ( while ago, but still), I had my WvW time...
---
I still consider this game my "home" or my "go-to", but honestly it's been ore than a year now that I only log in for special events or releases, otherwise I do my daily (even though I capped AP on that a while ago) and leave.
---
Even before that, I would pretty much only login to farm tons of mats, and that was my daily routine and it kept me occupied at night while watching some series on the side. It's grindy, but it's another way of enjoying the game.  
---
As some people said, I think it comes down to setting goals for yourself, and if you can't find goals that motivate you enough, I don't think there's any harm in keeping GW2 close by while playing other games. Playing other MMOs can sometimes be a good way to enjoy GW2 for its specificities, even though it also means you get to see what you think should be more like another game you enjoyed more in a specific aspect.
---
We've been playing since launch, it's been... 7-8 years (?), obviously we'd get a bit bored of a game's mechanics by that point, whatever new exciting stuff is introduced.
---
Welcome to how it feels to be Charr.
---
Beware that the Heart of Maguuma maps are dragon too, since Mordi was a Mind-Dragon, that could transfer his  **consciousness** into other beings that are connected to him, he has no "Official size" other than a quote form the HoT story "That he is the whole jungle we are walking on"
---
I dont find the picture anymore, but a datamined of Primordus whole snout-end was overlayed over Queensdale (i think it was) and it took the half of the map, so i think primordus is actually the biggest dragon with an actual dragon form
---
Giant Skritt world boss please. Tiktak is just ravaging the land and you have to find shinies to throw at it!

Which pvp reward track gives blc keys? I’ve never heard of this 
---
But they can keep players interested for much longer periods between content updates. GW2 struggles to create enough content and incentives to keep players engaged for a few days, let alone the months between updates.  
---
Can you share your build?
---
I was close to what I'd call "close enough" on my boon share chrono when it got the nerf. Haven't played it except to farm iron and flax since.
---
It’s one of the locked rooms you access using the plates (Blue one iirc)
---
The boonduration cap is at 100%, the additional 30% quickness would just be wasted 
---
You smell....different?
---
I remember toughness having an effect aggro on the ettin in the raving asura fractal, but it's been a while.
---
No one likes having to fail events...
---
Them tendrils are under every HoT map though.
---
Fair enough. Just wanted to make my thoughts known.  I do appreciate all of the work you all do to maintain our subreddit. :)
---
Just finished a few minutes ago. This scene hurt so bad. Dammit. It's been so long since I felt that in-game.
---
&gt; why not my commander since shes a sylvari?
---
Cool. And what about everyone else? I play a Charr. Mammals don't Brand well, and there's evidence of such all over the place.
---
Canach is a cagey, vaguely paranoid ass on a good day, and Rytlock has every reason to worry about dragons after he and Destiny's Edge tried to take down Glint and Kralkatorrik. Kralk killed Snaff *and* Glint, remember? Rytlock still feels partly responsible, and he's understandably wary of anything that might go awry.
---
That 'Well, meh' feeling you're describing is emotional numbness. It's shock. Go scroll back through the subreddit for the past few days; folks have been popping back to the Precocious Aurene instance just to sit with her and other folks have gone back to Sun's Refuge just to curl up in the nest we made for her there.
---
It's shock. Everyone is looking to the Commander for an answer and we *almost* had it... We *almost* pulled it off, but we had to rush it and things failed and now we don't know what to do.
---
if its anything like john wick, we gonna get another puppy soon 
---
In underground fractal, at the phase where you have to press 2 buttons to access the door opening console the dredge aggro the player with the highest toughness when in range. Idk if there are other occasions where this takes place, on bosses it doesn't tho
---
Killing off a character that has been developed for 3 living world seasons and 2 expansions is not growing balls or adding teeth, if she doesn't come back then it just feels like a waste of time.
---
Had a similar conversation of NPs in which they talked about their doubt of Aurene and whether a dragon can be good at all, maybe it was the same? 
---
Hit me right in the feels, though. 
---
Gotta be the first hit. Got 1. 
---
Did the event 3 times yesterday. Quite enraging. 
---
&gt; book
---
While we're wishing for things, I'd like somewhere to store my library, please?
---
We see a tiny bit of Kralkatorrik in the instance though. It is basically just his head that are stuck in the cave. So surely quite silly to compare just a head with the full size of all of Zhaitan? 
---
Again, you're trolling or seriously deficient. This thread is not a discussion of whether or not the feature will happen. It's a discussion of whether or not the feature was promised to be "added shortly after the Festival of the Four Winds".
---
&gt;She practically went into a Hyperbolic Time Chamber with her mom to train for Ascension.
---
It was the opposite, we were in there for 10 minutes and Caithe said it had been 2 days.
---
&gt;Aurene's body was branded
---
She was impaled by crystals.
---
And so far I haven't seen anyone who thinks Aurene is actually gone.
---
That’s what I was guessing. Was hoping boon specific boosts would exceed the generic boost cap. I think it could have been really cool to play around with additional gear/rune/class combos. Thanks for the info.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release
---
If it works like the slaying achievement, that weapon needs to be the one delivering the *killing blow* for it to count. So for axe, power warrior offhand is probably the way to go.
---
That dredge is lucky none heard him, or it might becomes purging time.
---
&gt; Maybe she was scared not because she was afraid of possibly dying, but she knew she had to die in order to set in motion whatever is coming next. That is what I think.
---
That's what I thought as well. When she lay with her mother in the beginning, it reminded me that Glint *also* foresaw her own death and understood that it had to come to pass for her legacy to fulfil itself. Glint prepared trials for her scion and its champion because she knew that she was going to die and that the fate of Tyria would fall to them.
---
Aurene definitely understood that she was going to have to die just as her mother did for the sake of Tyria, and that there was no way around it. As she lay there beside her, it was a moment of perfect empathy.
---
And although I fully expect her to come back (I'm guessing at Tyria's multiverse, or time travel), it doesn't quite make up for the fact that she, a child, had to die.
---
She had a jack sparrow baby
---
Scourges were originally humans Joko tried to train to use his necromancy.  
---
Many of them realized the kind of magic Joko was teaching them was very bad, so they ran away and changed the way they use their magic from enslaving people to protecting them with sand shades.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Akesi_Xuni
---
But the important bit from this is that awakened didn't need Joko to make more awakened. A few awakened and mordant crescent also learned how to make more awakened. But it is not clear whether that was their own power, or them channeling Joko's power through their connection to him.
---
This mean there must be at least a possibility that more awakened may be made. 
---
off course, if they kill a character that ppl are invested in it will ruin their mascara 
---
Fun fact: this achievement required some light tech work. As a result, we now have a condition we can check named "Char is Naked."

Worth it.

So now that we'll have a reason to strip, any plans to let us dye our underwear anytime soon?  :p
---
Randomization is the only realistic way to somehow increase replay-ability. Otherwise I don't even see why somebody would waste their time on clearing exactly the same fractal again and again. Seriously, what could be the reason? It's just same old stuff, so boring. Randomly layered challenges spice the whole thing up, a bit. At best, they just need to be fine-tuned on per-fractal basis.
---
I think DH is really solid, especially for fractals! And on some raid encounters it can be particularly useful, like when there's lots of adds to cleave down. I pug fractals on my DH pretty regularly, and find it both straightforward and enjoyable to play.

Now with the new access to Diviner's stats, I'm probably going to be looking at building out my chrono finally, though I'm still kind of reluctant to do that given all the talk of "chrono jail." But I'm hoping this new gear will be perfect for off-chrono, it seems like it will.
---
The jungle definitely was Mordremoth. The tendrils are not mordrem, they are Mordremoth himself. Obviously he wasn't a giant dragon shaped creature the size of the jungle, but he was the size of the jungle.
---
Some say there will be another episode in season 4, some say season 4 is over.
---
What's correct?
---
Could have been neat true, same goes for specific conditions (stupid easy to cap burning for guard and engi)
---
For the stubborn achievement in the new episode, does taking and using one of the dragonblood spears count for accepting help? I didn't get the achievement but I definitely didn't eat the meal or accept help via the dialogues where it warns you that you won't be eligible. I did have to restart from a checkpoint (was standing where the rubble piles up when the dredge break the wall and got stuck inside). Maybe that messed up the tracking for the achievement.
---
Like Mario!
---
&gt; but because the more repeatable, relevant content you make, the more spread out your playerbase becomes.
---
Bullshit. This argument is a stupid fallacy which has been debunked over and over again, with multiple approaches.
---
One of the better solutions is copying the GW1 model: Rotation of dailies. Give each piece of content its own special day every few weeks where you get bonus rewards for going there. If it works for GW1 with barely anyone playing, then it's going to work for GW2 too.
---
For fuck's sake, I can find a group to kill fucking Duncan the Black in hard mode (a certified pain in the ass) in GW1 (a "dead game") faster than I can find people to do any story mission in GW2 (a "living world").
---
The problem lies in neither the community nor the medium, but the failing design behind the content itself.
---
&gt;We don't need a lot of maps that compete with them.
---
If you don't compete against your own content, other games will.
---
&gt;They don't want to make old content irrelevant by nerfing it completely.
---
It sure doesn't look like it. Their current production model is a copycat of fast food chains, treating customers like locusts with no taste whatsoever, constantly throwing short-lived pieces of shining junk at them.
---
Stick to something and refine it until it's good? Nah, let's just throw away new ideas every patch, who cares, look, it's NEW STUFF. Oh wait, you liked that and want to see more of it? Too bad, it's not returning ever again. But we have more and more NEW STUFF coming, how exciting, am I right?! Also, we have more explosions this time, too!
---
Guild Wars 2 is the videogame equivalent of a fast food chain hamburger, its recipe and menu extras changing every week. And everyone knows how unhealthy those are in the long term, for both the customers and the employees. This business model is not sustainable, because you either get tired of eating the same thing over and over again, or you get mad your favorite recipe isn't coming back.
---
can confirm &amp; by ogdens hammer its glorious on FB. (very glassy though)
---
I wanted buy to but my parents think spending any money on video games is a complete waste 
---
I just hope Aurene doesn't comeback and her dead body becomes some shrine or something. Please don't bring her back because she ate Joko.
---
i found that using herald/dwarf build with maurader gear is quite tanky and bursty in open world. I use the sword/sword and staff. For long fights that cant be bursted down, i would use the circling hammer the dwarf provide as a utility to life steal and dps at the same time. For point of reference, I'm able to solo guild bounties with this build without any trouble. Pretty much could stand there taking hits and heal back up with the hammers hitting every second. 
---
I noticed that blue glow as well and am glad it wasn't something I missed every episode beforehand.
---
Its frowned on by the mods but the best way to get rid of them is to video record them in action, load it to youtube then plaster it everywhere.
---
Sadly many of them use free to play accounts and don't even have to by new cheat software since the same ones have been around since original launch.
---
That's so cute
---
That's what I see happening too.  It would actually be kind of interesting though if Taimi ends up deciding not to go through with the golem thing but Gorrik puts her into Scruffy anyway.  He's already been hit real hard by losing Blish and if anything happens to Taimi I can totally see him going damn the consequences, I'm not losing someone close to me again.
---
There will be a 6th and final episode for Season 4.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
I m pretty sure it was stated in game that both dragons were incapacitated due to Baltha succing them very hard,although i can imagine the opposite energies also played a part in it. Regardless of that however,the energy Balt absorbed did not damage anything or anyone,nor did it corrupt the world. Also,last i checked as long as something absorbs the magic and it doesn t contaminate Tyria,the world is just fine. So no one would have died if Balthazar had absorbed the dragons.
---
He only cared about getting back at the other gods,he had no interest in destroying Tyria after that.
---
I thought the same. But who when will be replace of Kralk? If not Aurene? Noone left. That means she will revive i think. Aaand its...not lame, but meh(
---
Just my own observation, but "intelligent" mobs seem to attack me most whenever I play support with Minstrel stats. Animals and such I think aggro on damage or proximity.
---
Just don’t have near those Puritanical Firebrands - they’ll only cleanse it.
---
I have suspicion people who vote for a change like this aim to just do each fractal one or two times, and move one somewhere else (another game), so they don't really care about replay-ability that much. For those who like the game's mechanics, but lack any really opportunity to use them to its fullest in open-world PvE due to it being dumbed down and made "casual player-friendly", fractals become the only place to go - and doing one of them, like, dozen of times just hardly possible and fun, unless your experience differs each run, preferably differs greatly (even if it becomes harder, challenge is ok, but static content is guaranteed joy-kill when you have to do it many times).
---
Well yeah, but you don’t need full nights sleep on week nights right :\^)

Isn't Team 2 known for timegating? They were responsible for The Wayfarer's Henge and Mark Y Golem after all.

Doing a single instanced quest that takes 2-8 people at most is not equivalent to populating multiple maps and shards full of enough people to do massive meta events (15-50), continuously, all day, for months on end.
---
Fuck off with that "lol it's easy, myth busted" bullshit. You want to talk hard, make equal comparisons. 
---
GW2's "unsustainable" business model has been more successful and lasted longer than GW1 was in its heyday. You're barking up the wrong tree if you think the "GW2 is dying" meme has any accuracy at all. You personally have been saying that on this forum for at least 2 years that I've noticed; **what the fuck are you still doing here** if that's what you believe?
---
I think you have to consider that when he was bigger he was also mostly magical looking. It is possible and somewhat likely that a dragon's physical body can change sizes. If primordus, for instance, was unable to shrink...him digging from the shiverpeaks to the ring of fire would pretty much destroy the world at his last seen size. Also his gw1 size was very small in relation to even tequatl.
---
We already know Mordremoth's size was undefined by a physical body. Zhaitan was just a bunch of dragons and adding more would make him bigger. Kralkatorrik is a giant storm and also a dragon. How would he hide for years if he was always at his giant storm size?
---
More like saying the storm is Kralkatorrik, and it is. The brand his his corruption.
---
Thanks, somehow an extra period got into the URL.
---
Condi mirage or condi scourge are safe bets. If you decide to go for support Mesmer at some point, I recommend the condi mirage for now, and stat swap when you decide you want to change it up
---
Delete.. in 3 - 2 - 1

Me too. I don't think I'll be able to bear it. After I left I put Spearmarshal's Plea back into my bank. When I found out it could teleport you not only to Spearmashal's Rest but also to Sun's Refuge in ep4 I was so happy. Now I don't ever want to see it again, ever.
---
Condi scourge, Power reaper. 
---
Condi mirage, power chrono, support chrono
---
Power weaver, condi weaver, heal tempest
---
I’ve only tried the Necro and mesmer they’re lots of fun and do what they do in great way and have an amazing survivabilit  and fairly easy to learn and gear, the elementest is not for me because it’s a glass cannon 
---
So if Taimi finds a magical fizz wizz which just so happens to be able to remove the disease from which she is suffering, that’s not a deus ex machina?
---
That isn't what I mean and you know it. I mean having an egg that we rescued in LS2, then nested in HoT, taught in LS3, killed Balthazar with in PoF, then battle bonded with in LS4, and having her die in an end of the world outcome would be a waste of 4 years of development investment.
---
There's no clear answer to that question really. It's one of those "play what you enjoy most" kind of scenarios.
---
I can give you a subjective answer though. I personally do everything open world PvE wise on my Reaper. All the Story stuff and map completions as well as achievements. But for fractals and raids I play my Harrier Druid (since that Druid is incapable of doing anything in open world PvE by himself obviously).
---
I wish I could do everything on my Necro and I was really trying (open my own groups instead of trying to join others etc.) but I just had to give up, bite the bullet, and realise that I have to split my "main" for different game modes if I really want to do any end game PvE.
---
35k to 39k will require at least 2 expansions. 
---
No, it is called creating a connection. 
---
I hope not :/ 34.5k here and running out of stuff I need to do that isn’t 1ap for a lot of effort 
---
It's a good thing NCsoft has nothing to do with Guild Wars development. :)
---
Congrats! I love to forge precursors. 
---
Actually, if this and the datamined Primodus head model tell us anything, it should be that we shouldn't be using actual ingame models in actual size comparisons, because those models clearly aren't meant to be compared with other models in terms of size, and that aspect of them isn't given any actual thought because it's not important.  What is important is that they look good in the specific situation in game where they're visible, and that's what they're designed towards.  
---
Imagine if Primordus' ingame model wasn't so ridiculously huge that it could be an entire continent by itself.  Now consider what that would look like when we see him in LW Season 3 Episode 5.  He'd just be this tiny little thing off in the distance that's barely visible.  He could be moved closer to the camera I suppose, but that would also decrease the awesome sense of scale you have during that whole battle.  
---
Same goes for Kralkatorrik's seemingly inconsistent size.  His size during the final battle in Path of Fire is perfect for being this massive head looming in the distance, lit up like a thundercloud, firing crystals at you and Balthazar.  If he was the same size as in All or Nothing he'd be barely visible at that distance, like Primordus.  Now consider if his All or Nothing model was as big as he was depicted before.  At that scale you'd barely be able to tell he was even a dragon instead of just some giant stone wall while standing next to him to attack his vulnerable bits.  At his current size you can actually tell you're stabbing a dragon in the neck instead of just sticking your sword into the side of a cliff.  At this scale, you can also appreciate the effort ArenaNet's artists put into updating his model, like how the underside of his neck now looks like the scales on a snake's belly.  You'd barely be able to make sense of that if he was much bigger.
---
Making extremely large enemies in video games, particularly ones that players have to actually *fight*, is a bit of a tricky business - you need to walk a fine line between making them large enough to feel properly gigantic, but not so large that the player loses track of the scope and ends up feeling like they're just hitting the terrain with their weapon. The Kralkatorrik we fight is, practically speaking, about as large as you can make something, and that's just his head and neck. Based on everyone commenting on how huge he is it can be assumed that the version we see is scaled down a bit to avoid potential issues, which is a bit unfortunate but ultimately better than the alternative - the only way they could really convey the full scope of the darned thing is to devote an entire map to it, which would make the eventual boss battle difficult to execute well. I hope they get a chance to really showcase how enormous Kralkatorrik really is, perhaps in a dedicated story instance during E6, but it would be tough to pull off well.
---
Unlock stats from gw2eff : 
---
Chasing Tales:  Enduring Hatred is at **19** of **196,093** (0.010%)
---
Chasing Tales: Like a Wounded Beast is at **5** of **196,093** (0.003%)
---
so it's not impossible per say, but it does seem like something may be off, as i'd imagine at least the 14 that unlocked the 1st one did so with the other. 
---
Skimmer and Rollerbeetle are my least used mounts. I'm nearly always on my Jackal or Griffon.
---
The vines are extensions of his corruption. They're not the jungle. The vines are the equivalent to the Brand that Kralkatorrik leaves in his wake. The smaller tendrils are mordrem.
---
Don't kid yourself. Drooburt's their extortionist expert and division head.
---
Since i got griffon probably jackal. I still use them all for different reasons but i prefer raptor over the jackal
---
I think that was the intention from the beginning
---
Skimmer and springer 
---
Eh. Sometimes. But finding more relevance is usually nicer.
---
Not sure why folks downvote me for that though but meh.
---
bringing her back?
---
Jackal for sure.
---
If I have long distances I use a beetle, for general moving around a raptor, springer for jumping and shortcuts, and then skimmer to move across bodies of water. No use for jackal.
---
Raptor. Anything I would have needed it for has been replaced by Jackal and Griffon. It was soft-replaced by Jackal when I acquired that mount, only pulling it out for the largest canyons, but with Griffon I haven't encountered a single gap I couldn't cross using either of those two. Springer still is irreplaceable for sheer cliffs. Skimmer still gets me across large expanses of water too quickly to replace. And Roller Beetle still sees uses when I don't care about the map I'm currently on, only that I cross it rapidly, plus the races.
---
So Raptor is sitting in its stable back outside of Amnoon for me
---
I care
---
Skimmer is my least used, I haven't really ventured near water where I've needed to use it.  Then rollerbeetle, I can't control the damn thing. XD
---
I don't know who will replace her and that's why I'm so excited and loved the ending. We spent all that time and work raising Aurene to be the answer and she is just presumably dead now. I got chills when the commander just responded with "I don't know". It was perfect.
---
No, you can (and should) use the dragonblood spears. I also had to restart from a checkpoint and it cancelled out eligibility for all three achievements, so I'd say it's just that.
---
Just replay the episode, go to the mission entry, and start from the second option (the beginning of the attack) and you should be able to get the achievement without having to go through the hallways and speech again.
---
Thanks for these, it’s great to hear that epic battle music without being obscured by the actual battle.
---
It's interesting that this wasn't already a thing considering that the PvP AT statues will display a set of default armour on a winning character if they were playing naked. Does this new condition differ in some way from the system used to check for naked PvP AT winners?

Bad bot.

Media yes, games no

Chances are looking really unlikely when it looks like, from this post, only one dev that will actively run with us for both servers.
---
Will do - good to know about the vanilla Lvl80 Soldier gear.  
---
I also want to point out that the 250 oil slick one can be completed in two metas as I got around 150 from one last night. Both the oil reservoir event and the boss event count towards it. 
---
I see your point, but I have a bit more to offer.
---
Yes, it is nonsensical to rigidly compare these in-game models to each other. As ANet stated way back when, Zhaitan was supposed to be canonically 10x bigger than his in-game model. But then again, the entire map of Tyria is really just a caricature of the canon world, disproportionate and scaled down for the sake of the engine and the developers.
---
But as time has gone by and ANet has improved the engine and gotten creative with their presentation, they've been able to make bigger and more intimidating dragons, possibly closer to if not exactly as big as they were intended to be. So that's another angle of inconsistency.
---
All this to say, I don't think that anyone assumes that these are undeniable references for how big the dragons truly are. However, comparing the models gives us an idea of *just how big* the things in front of us are, since many of them are so mindblowingly massive.
---
It's important to remember, also, that each is presented with a specific emotion or reaction in mind. Primordus was presented as something inconceivably big to the point that the only part we could see of him (his snout) was already bigger than any in-game representation of a dragon we've seen yet. That seems to imply they want Primordus to come across as a slumbering giant among the dragons, even if what we see isn't always proportionally accurate.
---
for point 3. at the end caith's crystals crumble away so i doubt it sooo no
---
also i hope they have her stay dead. get the story to grow some teeth for once
---
Yes
---
I have all the .fx from the default ReShade installed but I'm definitely not using all of them. The .ini I posted defines the ones I am using. If you set ReShade to "Performance Mode", you stop it from loading every single .fx each time you load in.
---
I'm just hyped they included the Zephyrite Shanty to the first part of the map.
---
You know, I'm a pretty big hater of wings in GW2 character designs - but I actually really love your mom's take on those. Or your dad's. Whoever plays the female character in the painting.
---
This looks just great.
---
I have this same issue. It looks like the bug is part of the achievements. If you look at the achievements for "Chasing Tails: Storm's Eye" and "Chasing Tails: Torrent Of Magic" they both give the same rewards. They both give the reward item "Chasing Tails: Storm's Eye". So I would say the Torrent of Magic one is bugged, as it should be giving the reward for Torrent of Magic, not the Storm's Eye one
---
Sylvari (12).   Of those, 8 nightmare, 3 dreamer, 1 soundless.
---
Charr (12).  2 Ash, 3 Blood, 3 Iron, 2 Flame, 1 Gladium, 1 Misc
---
Human (12).  Literally the only ones not working against Kryta is an elonian and a kid.
---
Asura (11).  The only ones I play religiously is the Inquest and a slightly shady illegal doctor.  Shady characters are fun.
---
Norn (10). I don't tend to play norn much.  I was heavily turned off of them in HoT but I'm working on forgiving.
---
I honestly think that I played sylvari more when the group I RPd with tended to favor sylvari (at the time, I favored Asura but...I take what I can get)
---
As someone in the 30k+ club, I've put in a lot of effort for things that have given so few AP compared to, say, carving pumpkins on Halloween.
---
beetle, I basically forget it exists until I need to complete an adventure

Looks like a bad algorithm drew it.
---
This title is too spoilery tbh. "Big Spoil E5" + Aurene tells everyone remotely interested what happens.

Chrono or else, I guess it's never else, huh?
---
Just got some minstrel, I guess I will divine now (rrrreeee)
---
I'm gon' find another role and I won't mes now
---
You gon' get kicked and hit LFG you fucking bear bow
---
I disagree. I mean, I just cited *The Princess Bride*, a classic.
---
There's nothing to say that Aurene's "mostly" death hasn't incurred a permanent penalty the story's protagonist's will have to contend with, so I specially have to disagree with the claim it would kill all the plot tension. But that's really up to Anet to decide.
---
Who knows, maybe the next episode is a resurrection stoyline arc ... only to come to terms with the fact you won't be able to resurrect Aurene!
---
That is my point exactly. 
---
Question for both of you, do either of you hide your backpack?  I wonder if that is related since some people hide it and others don’t.
---
Rollerbeetle. Easily. Raptor is probably next least used. My favorites are Griffin and Jackal. 
---
The Branded Ley Line Anomaly in Vabbi changes a lot of things we thought we knew. 
---
There are a few considerations to take. I cant tell whats the maximum slow % u can achieve on ez bosses like sab,qairn,MO, gors but since this build is dependent on danger time, u are running with piss poor base precision meaning u get a great boost from slow but get kekt when there isnt any.U also have to take into account a lot of the merits of running improved alacrity. On matthias for example it allows for one extra gravity well, on kc unless u are running improved alacrity u will not have cs ready from one burst phase to another. It also slows down the application of boons because longer cooldowns.In bosses like sabetha where u have people return from cannons without boons it means that it will take much longer for u to give those boons back,people who will inevitably do more dps than u but get kekt so u can get bit higher dps at the cost of group dps which is counter-intuitive. Even on ez Bosses like MO having improved alacrity means u can clear squares faster where otherwise your group would take much unnecessary damage. On samarog it means having that extra grav well to get you through the cc. On deimos it means u will always have one aegis share for every slam (u can block every slam in the fight easily). This are just some examples of where improved alacrity offers way more value than more personal dps.
---
No it doesn’t? Anyone who watched the trailer and has been following previous episodes knows Aurene has a major role.
---
Mentioning her name is definitely not a spoiler.
---
This is just two amusing
---
Earlier than was intended. 
---
Basically this. I honestly both love the story of the new map and how it looks. I had an absolute blast exploring every little corner, which hasn't really been the case in the previous PoF maps so far. I enjoy the events going on and some of it's uniqueness. But at the same time, I enjoyed it so much I went HAM the first day and pretty much completed all the achievements I don't find a complete hassle and an annoyance to do. (e.g. all the time gated ones for honestly a very small reward or the ones where you collect 200 of something for 1 to 3 AP)
---
I was going to actually spend the time getting one or two ascended weapons before I found out you had to craft every single exotic first; of which most would honestly go straight to the salvage kit. I still enjoy every single HoT meta so far and could easily play them all daily.
---
I don't think I've revisited any PoF meta in months now. Only today I discovered I still have a ton of MP left in Jahai despite having 11 of them still left over after getting the new skill.  Of course trying to get those now is an absolute nightmare since there's about 5 people on the map every time I go over there. I mean; I can't really complain about that right now since everyone is obviously exploring the new map, I just really want them...
---
I don't have a problem with her dying, its more the fact that it can't all be for nothing. This is an mmo that needs players to keep playing, kind of hard to do that when the story is we gave the dragon a black eye, he killed our only hope, and literally everyone (PC, Dragon's Watch, the Pact, the mists, Tyria) is totally demoralized and gives up hope because Glint's Legacy (Anet's grand plan) failed and was pointless.
---
Your comment was basically the same as the one someone else made earlier, so I [decided to reply to it instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aebqp4/the_plan_spoilers/edqlawu/).
---
Mate, I said that GW1 quests are not the same as GW2 meta maps. I realize that the quests you suggested would be on daily rotation. My point is that you can't conclude that, because GW1 dailies allow you to find a handful of people once a day, that an equivalent system in GW2 would cause a concurrent and continuous population of players to shift around the world on a dime to continuously fill all the various maps.
---
Not to mention the fact that you haven't proven that that's even a favorable state. GW1 needed dailies because it had **no** good casual repeatable content. GW2 has repeatable content, everywhere, it's just some areas are better than others.
---
And no I'm not going to go through years of your posts. I don't think I need to. 
---
Beetle and Jackal for me. I tend to use the Griffon for everything the Jackal is supposed to be good at, and the beetle is only good if the terrain allows it (mostly older maps).
---
*There was me Heather. Poor, sweet Heather. Blown overboard in that storm... (wind) (thunder) "Help me...help me...please help me...help me...glub glub..."*

er mah flipping walrus either I or reddit butchered my formatting in the op xd.
---
3. I'm not really concerned about PvP, and base classes not being meta in high level pvp is really far-fetched for pay-to-win I agree.
---
4. I meant to put this in but I forgot and then I went to go make breakfast for the next few days, but in the event of a lack of martial artist-style class, I also enjoy fluid combo/situational rotation type classes. I also enjoy magic classes (especially fire. tbh my dream MMO class is a martial artists that uses fire to empower their attacks). I'll read into Elementalist, but is there any fluid/situational combo classes?
---
I like how you used the word *impregnated* to describe the link between Caithe and Aurene
---
Thanks for these answers, to add a little more info: I played both power tempest and power chrono (that’s why I have the light ascended armor and trinkets) but didn’t really love either of them. I haven’t played Necro in a good long while and Condi scourge seems great. Condi mirage also has my interest bc I have a H.O.P.E. just rotting in the bank. 
---
So to pose a second question: if I am just looking to do some open world, meta events, farming and so on, what would be a more relaxed option between the Condi mirage or Condi scourge? I feel like that might be the change of pace I need between super try hard dps and super try hard support. 
---
Thanks again!
---
NO.
---
And the largest combined army on Tyria ever would be quite a bit more than 200 NPCs, but that would obviously not go so well for performance. Just imagine thousands and thousands of soldiers clashing into the sides of the dragon and all being blown up. Each NPC easily represents 10 or 100 'lore soldiers' depending on the race (besides the norn of course :p) The cavern that the fight takes place in would have to fit all of them.
---
GW2 itself was in a better state of replayability back in 2012 than it is now. They just stopped developing replayable content like dungeons, and put all their eggs in the "shiny flash experience" basket.
---
Silverwastes is the perfect example of highly replayable content. Why haven't we seen anything like it since then? Instead, they spend their resources in one-time experiences. You can see everything a patch has to offers in 4-6 hours, then leave for the next 3 months.
---
A new fractal? Nice, and what kind of new rewards do we get? Oh, nothing. Sounds great. New zone? And has new rewards! Oh, they're highly time-gated, and expensive as fuck. And you don't even get anything remotely interesting after collecting them. You see where this is going?
---
If you want to talk about unsustainability, talk about producing content nonstop like if it was fast food instead of an actual permanent product.
---
Your comment is, to ! 
---
It really is spoilery. While it doesn't blatantly say WHAT happens in the title, suspension dots always have a negative connotation. And people aren't dumb. Taking other things into context you can discern that the title has a negative connotation. The episode is about a huge conflict with an elder dragon, the previous episode gave us a negative ending with a vision of death.
---
2+2=4. Skritt Math.
---
I honestly feel like taking away the builds like they worked in GW1 has had a major impact on what you're describing. I feel like builds as we know them in GW2 just hold the game back so much. Half of the skills and weapons aren't all that viable and the other half is either a meta build or something that decently works. I know, I'm oversimplifying it a bit \_too\_ much here. Your build still matters, but half of the time looking at something like metabuild, it feels like some of these are just clicked together using common sense. There's just not enough options.
---
But let's be honest here, GW1 stayed fresh for me for 10 years because there were just so many different skills to play with, so many different possibilities and so many viable combinations. Small changes in several skills would sprout completely different, new and intriguing builds that sometimes had a completely different way of playing them too. Being an active PvX member in the day, patch days were always super exciting for us, theory-crafting all sorts of new builds based on the changes.
---
I still don't understand why they tied half of your skillbar to your weapon and just completely ditched the second profession. After having tried out the beta, it's probably the thing that kept me playing GW1 for a few more years when GW2 came out before finally buying it and switching over. It just felt like it wasn't "Guild Wars" anymore. In comparison to "the good old days", I feel like skill changes just don't have that much of an impact anymore. Each time the forums are filled with people shouting how awful the changes are and how the profession being changed is now dead, but in reality I honestly don't feel like that much has changed after the last 2 years I've been regularly playing. 
---
Anyway, to get back to my point; Having tied half of the skillbar to the weapon and giving out a very very limited choice bound to one single profession for the other half, I feel like they've set themselves up. Changing it up in GW1 could happen by changing literally any of the skills of any profession and it could impact several other professions. Changing it up today means you whip out 30 dollars and buy the next expac for a new elite skill line. I don't even mind the money, I haven't regretted a single purchase I made. It just felt like "okay, this new elite line is what I'll be playing for the next year, I guess... ". If not longer. (despite having a character of each profession)
---
I honestly sound like I'm not enjoying the game, which isn't true at all. I really do still enjoy. But other than that one week after a new map comes out, it's just me enjoying the repetition of HoT maps, fractals, etc. It's not refreshing but at least the content is fun enough to keep me interested. I just wish the PoF meta's were as fun as the HoT ones. It's so sad to go back to a map and find it fully deserted. I used to think it was just a core tyria problem because HoT was more profitable and fun and was so much newer. But then PoF came.
---
I'm sure GW1 was a pain in the ass for them because of this, but it's what kept the game fun and fresh for so many years. 
---
&gt;The most famous, as she ate our favorite mummy she can perhaps use this magic to rez
---
The way Elder Dragons inherit abilities by eating other types of magic has been introduced way back in the ~~Ember Bay episode~~ actually even earlier than that, in HoT? Then it is shown that it's not only limited to Dragons eating each other's magic, but also Dragons eating other creatures such as Gods.
---
I really am expecting Aurene to have inherited Joko's ability to come back from the dead by eating the magic that kept him alive.
---
I also can't wait for people to say that it's too predictable and bad writing because the story gives us enough info to figure this out on our own.
---
This scene is so intense, holy fucking shit. Standing up and walking around slowly, dizzy, wounded and not knowing what happened to her and your friends while there is no sound or anything, just this grim feeling or aura. 
---
And when you remember that this is the exact pose she had in her visions it hits you right in the feels.
---
I can't wait for the next episode, my hopes are getting too high already.
---
Skimmer. Too slow on any surface that isn't water.
---
Thanks, I will try this! 
---
You should try the new map released in the last LS episode if you like climbing mountains.
---
Jon, Jon, Jon, what have you gotten yourself into...
---
Regarding the fluid combat: most classes have two active weapons they swap between. You can change your entire build and swap skills around almost any time you're out of combat. The game is big on convenience. 
---
Elementalists swap between four elements on the fly, so that's a very fluid choice. They have an elite (level 80, from expansion) build that lets them use two elements at once. 
---
Guardians feel very fluid when you play them; I think they're very polished in terms of gameplay. 
---
EDIT: Do double line breaks, like leave a blank line.
---
Support Chrono is really not in a bad spot right now, especially in Fractals; with the release of Diviner gear it opens the door for some really nice hybrid support/dps builds. It's certainly not easymode as it was a month ago before SoI/mimic changes, but it's pretty easy to cap boon duration now to provide good quick/alac uptime even just using wells/tides of time, while still putting out good damage numbers since Diviner doesn't throw any stat bonuses away like previous +Concentration options did.
---
If you're not into playing Chrono, condi Scourge provides really solid group support with barrier while putting out decent damage and maintaining great survivability. I have a lot of fun on mine, and it feels like it'd be a good addition to your lineup given that you already have power DPS and support jobs out of the way.
---
Mine was hidden
---
I see, I wondered if it might happen randomly, just really weird to do. When I tried manually having 20 seconds appart it wouldnt work at all (, well I was counting down to 20 in my head). How would that even in a meta work, I am sure youw erent just standing there. Hmm. It must really be completely bugged.
---
Maybe if you stopped fighting your straw man we could actually have a discussion. But fore now, the only person losing their mind here seems to be you. Oh and just FYI, you can get the POI you mentioned during daytime.
---
That would be pretty weird considering Aurene has been a huge element of the story since pre-HoT. Which is why this episode had so much emotional shock value. But it would be foolish to just throw all of that buildup away and come up with some unexpected alternative to Aurene in the eleventh hour.
---
Thanks for this.  I didn't realize there was a limit on the oil pools and I was very frustrated.
---
Not to be that guy, but skritt are long established as using a collective intelligence of sorts. The more skritt there are, the smarter each is. It took thirty to be decent at poetry. (Adjusts glasses)
---
It fucking feels like the red wedding from GoT all over again. You are so invested, you have high hopes and want the good ones to win, succeed and then you get hit in the face. Hard.
---
I lost a lot of the obsession I had for the show after that and here I just closed the game off righter after finishing this episode. I will come back to see what's happening next but right now I feel devastated. 
---
Yeah, at first I thought you just couldn't put any pools in the purple area, but then later I could, so I was able to figure out that there was a limit.
---
Two plus two is four, minus one that's three, quick maths
---
And the ting goes skrrritt, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka
---
Commander told me "Take off your jacket"
---
I said, "Babes, man's not hot"
---
A hundred times better than the forced "cute", useless, and annoying creatures called Quaggan. Even Choyas are far better than Quaggans.
---
I didn't even go in.  I moved to the next missing PoI.  I should check it out sometime
---
&gt; Dwarf: *"What? You shy about a little skin showing?"*
---
&gt; Commander: *proceeds to strip in defiance.*
---
Ever since the Commander died, they straight-up do not give a fuck anymore about people's opinions of them.
---
&gt;I cannot be the only one 
---
You never are.
---
Here's what I do: walk underneath boss so that you're almost at the center of their hotbox while still being in front of them so the boss doesn't turn around and smack your allies. Then place the edge of the well underneath you with the bulk of the well lapping over on the rear side of the boss. This allows allies more leeway when stacking on the boss.
---
Also keep in mind of boss phases. Don't drop a well if you know movement is going to happen before the well goes off. Most people will not wait. At the start of the fight sw3, sh5 into CS, TW, SoI right away. Having a group booned up 5 secs in is better than having them wait so you can do a full CS opener.
---
 If they miss a well at that point then mention SoI no longer gives boons and only extends so they can't miss a well.
---
That collection looks roughly equivalent to the Ambrite weapons collection - maybe easier, actually, but no less of a grind.
---
got two revenants that i play with both different specs. viper renegade and valk herald. both seem to play fine in open world pve. viper renegade kill stuff slower but i like the demon legend skills and shortbow playstyle
---
I wasn't focussed on using axe during the meta, just killing mobs here and there. Eventually got it. Axe is part of my standard set though (i'm a necro).
---
I haven't played the ep and I won't cause perma anger stage. Call me when Anet revives her.

Skirt = new playable race...? No. Gods, no.

Skirt = new minion-based skill? Possibly gained from equipping a special item/weapon? Yes, please! 
---
That is all... 
---
I feel like this is where I was headed. For some reason Mesmer just isn’t my cup of tea and while tempest was better, it still just felt wrong for me. I’m going to give the Condi scourge a go! Thanks
---
i think the shock value is undermined with alot of ppl because they expect aurene to come back. it's at least the reason i don't give a shit.
---
also they could make it so aurene had to die for the prophecy to come true or something.
---
I am doing the axe one and I managed to get the one to kill 30 mobs with an axe. But the other two for example to defeat 4 mobs sequentially within 20 seconds simply doesn't work for me. I tried various different tactics and methods and nothing ticked.
---
do both meta for 10days, meanwhile farm 1700~ish maptoken (+250 for possible ls4 legendary trinket)
---
there is a circle thingy in diviner inscription recipe which drops from meta you need a lot of those aswell
---
oh and meanwhile doing the metas lay mines and vacuum oil
---
Guild camel mount is my least ridden mount because it hasn’t been announced yet.

Watch out where the huskies go.

Removed: Some debate about how spoiler..y the title is. I think knowing the ending makes it seem a lot more of a spoiler than it is, but best to be safe than sorry - feel free to repost with a different title. 
---
Least to most often used:
---
Jackal &lt; Beetle &lt; Bunny &lt; Skimmer &lt; Raptor &lt; Griffon
---
that'd probably kill the story for most ppl with standards
---
Could you please show us how to do that?
---
Curious. What was really spoilerish? The mention of Aurene, the ellipsis, both together?
---
Sorry if this is a weird question, but how did this happen? Do you use some kind of voice-to-text or predictive text input? Maybe it's just me, but I see this you're/your their/they're flipping everywhere nowdays. And as far as I can tell, it started in the last few years.
---
Again, please don't take this the wrong way - English isn't even my first language, so it's not that I'm being elitist here or something like that. I just see this thing a lot, and just curious.
---
Jackal, it seems pretty much useless besides sand portals :c
---
On the plus side there was a post about acquiring the ascended recipes, and it doesn't require all of them, you just get a recipe to upgrade the one you created.
---
I don't think they're the same. Those weapons only require insects, which are given by reward track in addition to random drop on the map. New dragonsblood weapons require 3x jewels which are only available from the meta (I'm not lucky so anything that has "very low chance to drop from N" practically means I won't get it as a random drop). if rewards track gets adjusted to give those (none right now) -- maybe. Full reward track doesn't give enough masses to complete even one exotic weapon. So way, way, way more grind and meta grind and masses grind :(
---
It will be cool. N00bs are welcome too. PMed ya.
---
* Humans come to Tyria by the gods and eke out a living in some places.
---
* Humans tend to form groups around  disciplines: arts, farming, etc.
---
* Governments aren't particularly powerful or useful in resisting the natives, so humans start to lose bigly.  
---
* Abaddon (the "bad" god) wants the gods to intervene.  The other five are more interested in playing keg brawl.  
---
* Abaddon gives magic to humans.
---
* Humans promptly realize that magic requires multiple disciplines. Humans reform into cross-discipline guilds to build the resources needed to exploit ever more powerful magic.  Infighting between humans begins.
---
* A series of three major wars involving the guilds defines much of Tyria's history; notably, the third and final Guild War that ends when the Charr take advantage of human myopia on the war and shatter the human strongholds with the Great Searing.
---
Thus, the game is the history of the Guild Wars.  Guild Wars 1 is pre-Searing/post-Searing events of the last Guild War, including dealing with the resealing magic to manageable levels.  Guild Wars 2 is 250 years later, with the humans gods having disappeared long ago and magic is running amok again.
---
Stay below 1300 unless you're the tank you'll be ok
---
Skimmer I think. I don't own the beetle yet, though. Raptor is probably a close second, though I still really like him; it's just the jackal is... well... better? 
---
I think that's somewhat retconned out by the new lore in this episode that describes Kralk as a seer and at least capable of intelligent thought.
---
More generally I think by the time of HoT ANet had made the decision that having "insatiably hungry uncaring forces of nature" doesn't really work out as great villains.
---
It's a silly theory in either case anyway.
---
Tldr; Maybe Aurene will resurrect herself next episode. 
---
I think like 99% of all "what will happen next" stuff is exactly this statement.
---
What's the best PvP build for Ele?
---
naked lupi solo achievement when?
---
Update: The 20 seconds quest I just made it in the meta too. I think Anet is not capable of english and means WITHIN 20 seconds and not 20 seconds apart. Still one to go.
---
You can skip many of the points (maybe that's even preferable timewise?) and get gold.  Seems relatively forgiving.
---
Didn't we spend an entire episode learning that outright killing the dragons is bad? Am I missing something, or are we just ignoring that now?
---
It felt like the scene where the player char suddenly turns on/stops trusting Caithe during HoT, which I didnt like either &gt;&gt;
---
Really? The halo effect is pretty cool I think 
---
Twelve seconds apart. Impressive.
---
i'll put my post here then:
---
or point 3. at the end caith's crystals crumble away so i doubt it sooo no
---
Jackal for sure. Raptor or Rollerbeetle is for crossing long distances most of the time, but if I start high up then I use the Griffon instead. Skimmer is the fastest over water (I think), and Springer is just specialized for tall cliffs.
---
God damn, 3360 is an ungodly amount. Those jewels also take some time to get. 
---
No it doesn't it means I have a different opinion who are you to tell what my standards are with any type of story. Aurene ate an undying lich, consumed his magic its perfectly reasonable she can use that magic to revive herself.
---
So this would be the very first "real" defeat of the Commander The loss of hope of a Tyrian with the elder dragons? 
---
I might not've been attentive enough either but I've been wondering the same the whole episode. Maybe at some point it was established that Aurene is assumed to manage eating all of that magic, or given the circumstances, we're just choosing the lesser of two evils without much discussion?
---
&gt;My hope is that the guild will disband in some way (just like Destiny's Edge), with each member going off to do their own stuff and research, slowly seeing the situation unfold. I hope the overall pace of the story will slow down, with the commander delving deep into forgotten knowledge/magic, ancient ruins, etc.
---
There isn't time for any of that, in the short time after sucking up Balthazar's juice, Kralkatorrik invaded the mists and essentially tapped into unlimited magic which is not only screwing up the mists, but devastating Tyria. And after Glint's forces beat him up in the mists, he just found a new spot and quickly regenerated. This isn't like the other dragons or pre PoF Kralkatorrik that just slowly sucked up ambient magic and grew their armies, he is a hurricane of hunger devouring anything he can reach.
---
If getting carried by the creator on EU is an options I might bring out my old BS again... :D
---
&gt;Have you seen any advertisements for Guild Wars 2 lately? I sure haven't.
---
I don't know about you, but the entire background of https://www.mmorpg.com/ is a GW2 advertisement for me.
---
Ye same here. I can understand their/there confusion, however if one knows that "they're" is a combination of the words "they" and "are" there is no way to mix this one into it. However I guess brains are a big mess and a typo can happen (aka unintentionally using the wrong word).
---
Yeah was thinking something similar. Why not let her be dead once and for all, and let the commander go through this existential crisis. Then, grabbing himself by the balls, he goes on far off quests in strange lands (Mist expac?) to find hidden knowledge from the Seers and Mursaat on how to defeat the dragons. 
---
Eh, Jackal was my work horse over and above Raptor by a large margin until I could completely replace Raptor with Griffon. Jackal not only has the teleporting ability but it's easier to make work for sharp turns, with more charges. Raptor is fine for some, but it feels far less easy to manuever than even the Roller Beetle after mastering that.
---
Thier*
---
an entire season might be a bit much but it could definitely fill an episode
---
&gt; Except if you think about it... all of the signs are there
---
Signs can be interpreted differently. See science and climate change. Nobody hold the ultimate truth about GW2, including you.
---
&gt; Shrinking playerbase
---
Source?
---
&gt;  less devs allocated
---
&gt;  LS4 suddenly leading into LS5
---
Just like LS1 went into LS2, except this time Anet is in full control of their product, its technologies, its direction, and its release thanks to 6 years of trial and errors.
---
We still don't know the scope and scale LS5 will have so until its first episode get released we cannot factually determine anything.
---
&gt; It's not hard to not be a overhopefuly fanboy
---
Sure, I'm a "overhopeful fanboy" lol, that's not how you make a point buddy. It's also not hard to be a dramatic negative Nancy. But alright, let's address your other points:
---
&gt; how is the game going to survive with no expansions?
---
The same way it did before HoT. Back in May they said they went through restructuration processes and new technologies for better efficiency and cadence for living story episodes. Also, they said back in September they don't intend to hold back Expansion worthy features behind expansions and they will be delivered through episodes.
---
Which means elite specs, new mounts, game-changing features *could* be released in six months.
---
Also, while I find the Living Story too formulaic, they may be able to pull package releases, like two-three maps at once, who knows really. Until LS5 starts we have no way to tell how they plan to address things. We're still in LS4.
---
&gt; We cannot forget the increasing length between content release
---
Will be addressed with LS5 if they are true to their words. 
---
I'm afraid Snargle needs to be constrained, otherwise he could attempt to /gg.
---
same
---
pls, I would reroll all 13 alts I have to skritt in a heartbeat.
---
Soulbeast.
---
I think this is a trick of perspective. In the last story instance, he's comparable to when he was in the sky.
---
For most of the fight, he's extremely far away. When you actually get close to him in the end, a charr PC is only roughly the size of his eyeball, and a tooth on the side of his mouth is nearly as big as a dredge tank.
---
Watch the parts where you channel the crystal and he slams into the rampart. The perceived size when he's in the middle of the cave versus when he falls into it are way different.
---
I'm not OP and I agree it's better to be safe than sorry (as said by your teammate TheRabidCoder). It's just that I wasn't really considering the title spoilerish per se without context, tone and knowledge of the episode. 
---
Kralkatorrik's power is growing exponentially and ripping apart the mists and Tyria and everyone is probably demoralized and giving up, where would there be time for that?
---
Hi there. brand new player here. I was wondering how much of an impact can race make to your class choices?
---
I always hated that dredge were only ever enemies when nothing in their lore points to them being evil, so having friendly dredge was really nice... 
---
it would be ridiculous to suddenly throw away everything the story has been hinting at (i.e. the plan to replace ED with Glint's scions) since the egg of Glint (which was an extremely long time ago) just to "grow some teeth"
---
Aurene isn't just a character to kill to make you feel things, it's the culmination of the Guild Wars 2 plot since Living World Season 2
---
You have to lower your expectations to match their potential.
---
It took them two years to implement ping meter, and it's still tucked in options menu.
---
None of those things are Deus Ex Machinas, actually - her killing Joko is close, but she was already involved in the conflict and we knew she could consume magic, so it stands to reason that she could make him stay dead. A true Deus Ex Machina is introduced at the last minute to resolve an otherwise-impossible conflict without prior reference or foreshadowing, and both the existence of Aurene and her helping us fight Balthazar make sense within the context of the lore and/or the events leading up to them
---
Now, if they suddenly dropped a new kid of Glint's on us to deal with the Kralkatorrik situation, or Aurene comes back to life through some previously-unexplained mechanism of Zhaitan's magic or something, *that* would be a textbook Deus Ex Machina. I doubt that would happen, seeing as there are more sensible options available, but poor writing decisions are hardly outside the realm of possibility.
---
OH sorry didn't notice that. But yeah we're being pretty strict on spoilers because of the ending and a lot of people are probably not going to play the story until this weekend. Being a mod myself I got the ending spoiled for me within only an hour of the patch coming out. Wasn't fun.
---
Uh isn't that for Ranger? :P
---
&gt; We have to face the facts
---
But there are no facts. Your "facts" are just what you read into the statements. Please stop spreading bullshit and stating it as "the only truth".
---
Balthazar wasn't the only one to show up. There were also symbols of Zhaitan and Mordremoth present. But yes, it was to show that Kralk was channeling the combined magic of all those whose magic he had consumed.
---
I think /u/_Greyling_ put it best in another thread, saying:
---
&gt; I got a good look at them. They're definitely Zhaitan, Mordremoth, and Balthazar. My impression was that the was bringing all three of their powers to bare on us in that one mega-blast, and their images was just a shorthand to remind us exactly how deep the shit we were about it be in was.
---
[Link to original comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aeeh5d/spoilers_question_about_the_final_instance/edolbfq/?context=3)
---
And then there is bosses (Desmina, Largos) where there is no "off" chrono. So you should have a tank set anyway (unless you are confident in your healers).
---
Thanks me too ...the boys tell people all the time they come from a gamer family lol
---
I think more parents/adults should play some online game with or without the kids... They have no idea the other world they are missing...and it would give them something in common with the kids 😁💜
---
Jackal is for survival, and groups. Raptor for soloing.
---
&gt;The subreddit has had at least one post a day for a large chunk of the last week about new players asking what to do, etc. BfA Refugees and the most recent sale helped that.
---
And how many of these refugees actually stuck around? The Bless refugees didn't, and the BfA refugees are just going to go back to WoW eventually.
---
&gt;Just because devs aren't pumping out an update every two weeks doesn't mean there's less. There was 3 teams of developers working on LS4 as it is, on top of stuff like the Fractal/Raid team and WvW/PvP stuff.
---
You know the Fractal/Raid team used to be two different teams?
---
&gt;We've known this for a while. They've also said they're changing the structure of the workflow, but the changes couldn't apply instantly. On top of also having "expansion-like inclusions".
---
Agian, please think as to why they made this sudden decision. *Because there is no real future for GW2 anymore.*
---
&gt;GW2 kinda advertises itself at this point. There's lots of knowledge about the game as it is. Everyone has at least a vague idea of what GW2 is.
---
Everyone knows what WoW is but even WoW makes an effort to advertise itself. In a lot of corners GW2 still has a reputation of 'ew casual MMO with no real challenge and no real balance and no real endgame.' The last one is depressingly close to being true, GW2's 'endgame' (raids and fracs) is laughable compared to other MMOs. 
---
next episode and season 5, 
---
we know where kralk attacks thanks to the tracker, 
---
the fight has clearly crippled him, 
---
the grieving can be done over an extended period of time while dealing with kralk and maybe one dedicated episode,
---
we could slowly weaken him over the course of the arc and we could try to temporarily incapacitate him if you really need to.
---
 and that's just me spiballing
---
Cheers for the quick reply :)

Hey man this is Guild Wars 2, death doesn't mean anything in this game. It's used to elicit an acute shock response when it occurs, then that character gets cycled backstage and brought back from the Mists to fill in plot-holes wherever the writers feel necessary. 
---
6) beetle, the beetle might cover great distances fast, if there isnt a hill, or too many obstacles during boost, or if i hadnt boosted off into the horizon missing where i want to go by miles. more troublesome then its worth.
---
5) i pretty much only use the jackal during human key runs, or if exploring and want a sand portal
---
4) the skimmer for branded areas, water or quicksand. often i will skimmer off a cliff and rapidly tap space bar to "glide" where i want to go and remain at height. but for tricky ground i find the skimmer keeps sliding off ledges and cant stop on a dime
---
3) any area with verticality and i'm on the bunny
---
2/1) its 50/50 with the raptor and griffon, i will climb as high as i can get then griffon across the map, then raptor around the area i want to be in.

i havent gotten the new mastery yet, i'm sure that is going to change the order of use for me as soon as i do.

Nothing but a troll. Don't waste your time here. Downvote/report and move on.
---
I can solo just fine with Jackal lol. Like what are you even trying to argue? I prefer Jackal, doesn't mean you can't prefer Raptor, agree to disagree, and peace out. I don't see a use for Raptor and that should be fine.
---
But can you also check whether or not a character is naked?
---
I've noticed the same thing with "etc" becoming "ect" and "should have/would have/could have" becoming "should of/could of/would of".
---
i don't really like that and i wished they changed it
---
nill
---
&gt; That was before they gave up and realized GW2 wasn't sustainable without expansions. Now they're giving up on expansions. Hmm. Peculiar.
---
"wasn't substainable" or "didn't fit the scale of their vision" are two different things. If really GW2 *desperately needed an expansion*, which is a guaranteed source of income, don't you think they wouldn't have pursued with this idea? PoF brought very substantial sales, you'd think they would try to repeat that again if needed, or that NCSoft would force-brute an expansion.
---
The fact they're going straight to another season show a certain confidence in their product and delivery imo. It's a bold move. It's alright to be doubtful. But **we don't know how it will turn out**. 
---
&gt; The last one showed a stark decrease. 
---
[Yeah, such a stark decrease](https://i.imgur.com/u4jZKgx.png)
---
PoF's sales were good, granted, but the sales remained somewhat consistent between 2Q18 and 3Q18 (the latter being actually higher). It's also equivalent to pre-PoF sales. 
---
[Source](http://global.ncsoft.com/global/ir/quarterly.aspx)
---
If they can pull the same amount of features and scale as PoF through living story episodes, so *free releases*, it will bring various players back *and* maybe encourage them into investing in the gemstore. Without having to pay for the content, it somewhat justifies gemstore purchases for various players. It's win/win for both parties.
---
&gt; Consider why both of those happened: perhaps because GW2 would not be getting any more 'proper' focus?
---
Or maybe Anet is doing what Anet always does and experimenting and trying to innovate their content delivery. It's a risky move to bring expansion-worthy features through LS releases. We'll see how it turns out before crying to wolves.
---
It isn't him that left us...
---
Remember when they awarded PvP skins? Why is there no “common” version of the wardrobe unlock -or even just a regular wardrobe unlock- awarded for that same role?
---
No its not a company can have multiple departments working on different games. I am so sick of seeing these. Z or MO need to make a statement saying GW2 is continuing and there are no plans to stop. In fact no Z said in the anniversary video they ain't stopping and they are hoping for more years for GW2 but this community can't be arsed to take that as confirmation that GW2 isn't ending.
---
You get different elite skills, but that's about it. They don't really matter because nobody uses them.
---
Of course I see zero adds. I use addblocker.
---
Fox and fish also beetle
---
At this stage, no chance (there was talk about it in the early days of GW2). That being said, you **can** play Guild Wars 2 with a controller. 
---
Here is a [comprehensive guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9w1pbk/complete_xbox_controller_support_for_gw_super_fun/) for setting up an XBOX controller in GW2 from only a couple months ago.

Not quite as convenient as a console, but there's nothing stopping you from hauling your PC over to your TV, allowing you kick back on the sofa and play with a controller. 
---
I would make all my characters skritt. No joke.
---
This is a thread by players, to help each other, not an official developer Q&amp;A. You will not get an official answer here.
---
My (a player's) personal guess, based on past development: New maps: very likely. Changes to stronghold: extremely unlikely
---
Where's the blue dwarf room at? 
---
i love how the usual reaction to my comment is somebody insinuating that everything somebody has been doing in life is immediately unsalvageably lost to the void upon their death.
---
What upsets me the most is the whole situation. Like everything in the final moments before the battle and how it turns out. If you walk around and talk to the npcs in the final instance, there's so much confidence and trust in the commander and Aurene. There are people talking with friends they thought they lost (but were awakaned), even an Inquest guy wanting to help us. It's just so sad if you talk to all of them while replaying the last mission for achievements, because you just know you will fail.
---
Where do you get the recipe for the (exotic) harrier insignia? I've spent well over half an hour on google trying to figure this out, but I can't find any information on how to get the insignia recipe. Just the stuff you can make with it.
---
Ahh ok, thank you!
---
So then PvP isnt only skill based? I cant imagine that when im honest
---
Nice, can you post some times if you are doing them this weekend? I need all Hot ones still. Would love to join. 
---
Just buy a controller map your keys and plug your PC to a tv
---
Looks like this has been fixed.  Or maybe it's just because I was one of the unlucky ones who didn't get taken to Thunderhead Keep at the end of Scion &amp; Champion.
---
If there is one achievement with 30 steps (for example find 30 chests and each chest gives you 1 ap) it counts as 30 achievements.
---
I've got everything but the single POI locked behind the metas, and didn't have any issues doing that. I don't think I followed anyone into a room. The only reason I don't have that yet is I haven't been around when a meta's *succeeded*, so honestly I'm not even sure if the reward has RNG attached.
---
I'm not happy about map completion being locked behind events whatsoever, honestly. I think it's a bad way to enforce gameplay and limit rewards.
---
I wouldn't say armor rating from those items is that significant, but it counts to your stats. Basically whatever you get as your starting eq when you enter pvp is enough
---
Black lion contracts 
---
Ok. Does anyone care though this game has the worst ap system in the genre. GW2 doesn't even have feats of strength and a ton of ap is forever unavailable lol. Big joke xD
---
I agree I think next episode she comes back and it will be our job to hide her from Kralkatorrik who will sense her. I think she "sacrificed" herself to save us because she knew the battle was going to fail and Glint told her to. Also saying next episode isn't too soon remember time between living world is the same amount of time in the real world. 
---
it is, you just have to wear basic armor so the game recognizes you have something on, it doesnt matter what level that gear is
---
If she does, any further 'message' or plot device power will have been transfered to her new herald/avatar, I expect.
---
Meaning we either get a kill reversal, or we use [Checkov's Ammo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun) without the gun.
---
**Chekhov's gun**
---
Chekhov's gun (Russian: Чеховское ружьё) is a dramatic principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed; elements should not appear to make "false promises" by never coming into play. The statement is recorded in letters by Anton Chekhov several times, with some variation:
---
"Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there."
---
"One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off.
---
Why do they keep doing these?  I like this game **because** it's so hard to screw over other players...
---
Honestly I believe if shes staying dead, then this is gonna be the last episode and nothing new will come anymore. 
---
You can get the poi by doing the story like I said but the problem is I don't want to do the story on all my alts just to get map completion. So I'm looking for another way to obtain it. It will be really sour if I have to play the story on all my alts just to get the map done. Edit: and you can buy the items of TP so if you don't wanna do that you can always buy it.
---
Players: How tf are we going to kill Kralkatorrik and stop Aurene's vision from happening?
---
Anet: I have a late christmas surprise for y'all!
---
Players: Thanks! We hate it!
---
Anet: No backsies noow.
---
Depends on you and how you play the game tbh. The most worthwhile purchase to me in the last couple years that wasn't something shiny would have to be the [Endless Upgrade Extractor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Upgrade_Extractor_Contract). 
---
I have a lot of infusions and swap Legendaries and gear between characters fairly frequently in WvW, so this is a huge convenience. You can also generate some free profit with it (or at least you used to be able to) by extracting sigils from runes that have a similar cost to the item itself, then reselling the rune and salvaging the gear. 
---
&gt;At the start of the fight sw3, sh5 into CS, TW, SoI right away.
---
Good advice, and it demonstrates why we need something better than snowcrows for average raiders, especially pugs. Those clowns recommend precasting a clone with staff 2, then swapping to sword in your inventory. 
---
With soul pastries and potent lucent oils, you get 51.66%bd 81.66%quickness (Conc sigil, firebrand runes with no concentration gear), using Sh5+TW+SoI+WoR in CS let's you WoR again outside and you can keep your alacrity for your next cs playing illusions, so yeah as I said you can throw diviner's legs for more conc if you want but it's not needed, if you are discussing about getting 100% alacrity and people are not stacking on your wells better not even try.
---
They did exactly same mistake in previous patch with one of PoIs and fixed it later. What pisses me off is that they never learn or think about these thing so we need to point fingers every single time.
---
The Inquest is an organization that formed right after the awakening of Primordus to regain lost knowledge as soon as possible and by any means necessary.
---
Imagine losing your home and the majority of your civilization and population overnight, not to mention countless amount of technology and knowledge, all while a world destroying threat looms ever-near, you’d do anything to combat that. The Inquest may conduct experiments that many would consider to be “immoral”, but they get results, results that result in the betterment of Asura-kind, even the Pact uses stolen Inquest tech in their battles against the elder dragons. 
---
There is a reason why they’re passively tolerated in Asuran society, it makes sense from their racial perspective.
---
Under normal circumstances, that Inquest should be seen as bad guys, but simply look at the state of their world.
---
*something something swimsuit outfits*
---
That was always my assumption, but one of the devs came out and talked about the scrapped parts of the mouth fight but I don't remember exactly what they said or when it was from.
---
Because honestly? It’s the first hacker I’ve seen playing this game for years, and he was using a free account “behind two proxies” to ruin people’s experiences. Basically just said he was going to bot and hack in the next arena and sell every top 50 slot apparently.
---
But I got an instant forum suspension for bringing this to their attention, and the support ticket I got back was “you seem to be mentioning your account was hacked... here are the steps you take to defend yourself....”
---
Automated response, a forum ban, and absolutely nothing done about the bots in PvP? Arena net just wants this game to die already because they treat their customers like shit.
---
Apocalypse is not what I mean. As I say in first sentence we have years ahead of us. However, I can't get rid of the feeling anet is in general wrapping up the game on multiple fronts.
---
All I play this game for is PvP. If the experience is ruined with botters and hackers, I’m done.
---
Ouch. Sorry for your loss, and the timing.
---
The one that has really become a thing is "alot" instead of "a lot."
---
There's multiple ways of acquiring ascended weapons, including but not limited to
---
Crafting (probably most expensive)
---
Fractals
---
Raids
---
Specialization collections (reasonably cheap but limited stat selections)
---
If you need a staff, /u/RSmeep13 mentioned HoT specialization collections for Bo and Yggdrasil. The most expensive component to each collection is a Mystic staff, which is expensive due to the # of mystic coins required in the recipe, but the kicker is that you only need to create it once to receive credit towards both of the collections. Other than that, it's mostly about purchasing items with HoT currencies. Staves are one of the most commonly used weapons across all professions, so it's not a bad idea to have 2, anyway. Almost certainly cheaper than crafting; Zojja's spire is going to cost 9 Spiritwood (~42g from sell orders) + 3 deldrimor (~15g) + other mats whereas a mystic staff will (inexplicably because the cost of materials is closer to 40g) run you 60g but apply to 2 collections at the same time. I only use crafting when I'm impatient and don't want to build up the fractal relics (I don't raid). Generally, I'll follow the hierarchy Collection -&gt; Fractal -&gt; Crafting but it's partially dependent on the scenario.
---
If you're in a guild you should ask someone with high specs to go on a photoshoot with you ! 
---
He most certainly did not.
---
He said they want to release expansion quality updates with the new seasons. He did not say there will never be another expansion. This was the original goal they set out for with GW2. They didn't originally plan to release expansions.
---
It was profitable enough for Daybreak/SoE to launch 24 expansions for EQ1. Do you seriously think EQ has been anywhere near as profitable as GW2 is for most of those expansions? People act like you need to be WoW popular in order to be profitable. GW2 is part of "the big 4". Out of all the MMOs out there, there's only 4 people really talk about, and one of them is GW2. This game is not going anywhere any time soon.
---
im making the focus as well, i am done with all of the chasing tales achievements, but i dont think the storm one counted? i cant use the vision crystal to commune with the font either. must be bugged, everything else is completed.
---
*riehT
---
I enjoy sending projectiles back to my enemy's face. How effective is sword/shield on holosmith in PvP, instead of the meta riffle?
---
I do believe they've thought the story through, but my main issue (which I'm sure others have too) isn't whether or not they'll bring her back.
---
It's that the mechanics of death have become so flimsy that they could take Aurene in virtually any direction without any justification. This is just a consequence of ANet playing extremely fast and loose with the afterlife through PoF and season 4.
---
She's dead, but continues to help from the mists? That's fine because Glint died and lives on in the mists.
---
She's dead, and doesn't continue to help from the mists? That's fine because Kralkatorrik consumed her magic and/or the Domain of the Lost was eaten and/or the mists were eaten.
---
She's dead and becomes awakened? That's fine because Joko was a lich and she ate him, and a lich dying was part of the prophecy because Ogden said so.
---
Ghosts can appear out of the mists, with agency, and fight things in the real world, as shown in the previous episode.
---
You see what I'm getting at? Death already doesn't matter. There are no constraints and this is a problem.
---
Also that bit in Ep 4 when Aurene wouldn't leave the Fortress of Jahai and everyone was getting really nervous about having a dragon hanging around. I think Anet clearly set up the notion that Aurene was getting more powerful and seemed to be growing beyond our control.
---
You made a straw man topic that prevented any meaningful discussion in the first place. 
---
Meta battle is reliable. I’m not sure what you are expecting though. Guild wars 2 has about 1/3rd the population of WoW and a much much smaller pvp pop. Builds listed as meta on metabattle tend to be min/max and BiS. 
---
That was it! Thank you!
---
Well I am not sure it's actually in the new map, but that's where it was in the first game and explains the Jade Construct in the area.
---
He could just regenerate in the mists like he did after Glint's forces did a number on him. He looked more angry than crippled to me and with Aurene gone it seems like he doesn't even have a reason to bother with Tyria anymore, he'd just destroy it from within the mists anyway since Glint's forces can't keep up with him.
---
Yes.
---
here's the thing tho, if it was a fake out, then anet has failed miserably because everybody is expecting aurene to come back. (ppl are saying "she *shouldn't* come back" and not "she *won't* come back" for a reason)
---
the big problem is that RN in the story most players aren't convinced death has real consequences (consequences that you wouldn't have gotten from turning the character unconscious for the time being) and when players expect a fakeout death then you run the risk of the grief to come off as insincere and manipulative giving the impression you disrespect their intelligence.
---
a fakeout death is just ineffective in all it tries to do if nobody buys the fakeout
---
Too bad season 5 has been announced.
---
* Dragon's Stand covers the entire map, and is far, far larger with far more rewards. Above all, I think it's done most for the unique rewards of the map that Ancient Karka couldn't really give.
---
* Maps made solely for a story instance is not really a waste, since they're not persistent world. Only waste of space maps there are, honestly, are Southsun Cove (and bringing back Settler events would fix that easily) and Domain of Kourna, imo.
---
* It wouldn't ruin the point. What point is there in having an event people don't do because it can't be completed? Even before its removal, Scarlet's Invasions saw few people working to complete them, they rarely got through the Molten Alliance phase (second army), let alone the third or killing Scarlet. Leaving them like that ruins the point of having content in existence, let alone bringing it back. It'd be fine as it was originally for the first few weeks, but eventually you'd need to tune it down or leave it as never-completed. Tuning down the difficulty and frequency like the Awakened invasions or bandit champs got ensures that, even with less involvement, they're still completable but not doable with small numbers.
---
* You cannot have the same story taking place in a different location. *That changes the story* because, surprise surprise, location is part of the story. And you can't just create a copy of one location and place it elsewhere on the world map, as that breaks the world map (duh), and [Anet stated they won't do such things for open world maps](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/55389/an-open-world-map-located-in-the-mists#latest). It'd be iffy enough for them to make *one* exception with the ruined LA map, let alone two for Tower of Nightmares. More are just flat out unlikely to occur until Anet's team leads get replaced. Besides, there's no need to worry about the original zones in the first place.
---
oh no our one and only plan failed, guess there's absolutly nothing we can do now. 
---
a new plan? trying to salvage what we can from the situation?
---
 all nonsense from the nonsense planet of the nonsense galaxy
---
Go to the metabattles website and click ele from the drop down menu - it will give you a list of all meta builds, the gear for it, tactics as well as user ratings for each build. It’s a great site for pvp 
---
Both are really strong for Fractals, although the build for Chrono will likely be different than in raids because you need more boon duration in Fractals due to only 1 chrono being present. DH is a blast to play because it's got really strong burst but I wouldn't say it offers a ton of utility outside of a small amount of shared Aegis. Obviously, good enough DPS for raids too but DPS can be provided by lots of different specs. You'll almost never have trouble finding a group if you roll Chrono.
---
&gt;(and something new will come in the next episode to help destroy the dragon)
---
And this Deus ex Machina crap will just piss people off more.
---
 [https://imgur.com/lmZbsXh](https://imgur.com/lmZbsXh)
---
39k and you get that? Man that's underwhelming.
---
if that's a problem that needs to be addressed then we can try to kick him out of the mists or distract him, just because we can't kill him or permanently solve the issue doesn't mean we have to leave him unattended.
---
That's the site I was using but each build only had like under 20 reviews. Seemed kinda low to determan what was BiS. I just dont want to commit to a build and find out the 4 people that said it was 5 stars were being generous.
---
Backpacks are classified as weapons by the engine. Same reason they don't get culled when we default to stock models, and the reason we can't dye them.
---
I just don't get why everyone thinks death has no consequence anymore in Tyria.
---
Arenanet has done straight up resurrection *twice*. Once in Factions, once in PoF. Even the Mists thing with Eir and Snaff is portrayed very much as a temporary thing, and they weren't able to stay in Tyria for very long.
---
I have commented on the test of your posts because Ibhavent made my mind up on the other things.
---
Ah yeah forgot that one.
---
The primary thief build, for years, has been [D/P](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Daredevil_-_Dagger/Pistol) with slight variations. This is honestly how you should learn how to play thief. [S/D](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief_-_Marauder_S/D) being another style that has been around for a long time, though it has been nuked out of viability a couple times over the years (returning relatively recently). 
---
If you want a skilled thief to learn from, check out [Noody](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-QH304zT3qOQ2PKrFmngSQ/videos). He has a fair amount of guides and tips&amp;tricks videos. 
---
Be aware that thief, along with mesmer, is the most mechanically technical and difficult class to play. The build itself is far less important than the many combos and tricks that are required to play a thief effectively as well as your own mechanical ability. If you can't BP + HS + Steal + BS combo on the drop of a dime, or know how to comfortably hop from one side of a map to the other with your Shortbow you won't be of much use in PvP. These things take practice and time though, the point being the build isn't what makes the thief. 
---
It's also important to know your role as a thief in sPvP (WvW is a different story) as you are not meant to be 1v1ing. Again check out Noody's videos as they will be very helpful. 
---
Thanks. In a way it feels healthy to have this going on in GW2 too.
---
I still have to laugh at the irony of burying my dog and thinking "Well, 'All or Nothing' releases Tuesday so that'll take my mind off things. 
---
Believe it or not : Raptor.
---
With proper control, Jackal is basically a more mobile Raptor with more frequent jumps.
---
Same thing fam. With pharus i finished my ranger with full legendaries. I suppose i could suggest, same as what im doing, to craft all the 32-slot bags. Another suggestion is just making the either core or HoT legendary version of whatever you already have lmao (like you have frostfang, make astralaria)
---
Time to uninstall?
---
I guess it's a matter of oppinion. I don't find that boring at all.  
---
And being predictable doesn't automatically mean bad or boring.  
---
I heard this comment on various occasions; From Sylvaris being dragon minions to Lazarus being fake and such.  It all comes down to how well the story is implemented and not how many characters are killed off.   
---
I would most certainly prefer to see Aurene come back to life and have more moments like we had in the last episode (with combo attacks, and focusing on the bond we created with her) than keeping her dead just for the sake of "predictability". 
---
There is no gear commitment in PvP, you have free access to everything and can swap with 0 cost. 
---
BiS doesn't apply in GW2. 
---
Yes, you can. And it's fairly profitable :)
---
How is Aurene gonna absorb Kralk's magic by being dead? You don't make sense
---
Yes I know that, so thats why I believe that Aurene isnt just completely dead and out of the world.
---
i answered based on the assumption that *"everyones stats are the same no matter what for equipment you war"* already implied an *"as long as you actually wear armor"*. seems i was wrong in that.
---
You don't actually have both kind of weapons types like my Ele Full Legendary (just missing a couple ones).
---
I mean, Bifrost + Nevermore, Bolt + Shining Blade, Frostfang+Astralaria, etc.
---
Also, what about water weapons?
---
Sad to see all the folks who never bust out their roller beetle, my mounts are bound Shift + 1 through Shift + 6, and beetle is S+1.  I understand it can be tough to move with but it's so fast and if you botch it into a wall and lose all speed you can always just hop to something else.
---
Nailing beetle turns and getting way ahead of groups of people during events feels so good, its some of the most fun I have.  I spent like 10-15 minutes just riding around Deldrimor Dig when I found it.
---
Not anymore. They did try to do this but it was getting too difficult to release new content at that pace.
---
I wanna say jackal and skimmer buy I try to use the best mount for each situation.
---
I'll try to do one tomorrow (Friday) at 1900 UTC+0, add me as a friend and you'll see when I am online so you can ask :P (because I am not good with names)
---
&gt;The Shattered Observatory fractal suggested it wasn't possible for people in the mists to punch through to Tyria, but I guess that's not canon any more.
---
I think that was because they were part of the the fractal loop that we were going through, Arkk could have actually gotten Dessa back to Tyria and the ones we encountered just realized that they were not the real ones and had to end the loop.
---
I have one 32 bag slot and the rest is 20 which is just fine for me ;-) and I made each Legendary specifically what I liked most. I have a very snow-themed character so frostfang for example fits better than astralaria, and so on. So I really don’t see a point in crafting the other (which more me fit less and are aesthetically uglier)
---
Chrono is only easier to get groups with because it is supposed to support, tank, do mechanics or all of it at the same time in the most expensive gear obtainable. There is only so many people who do that voluntarily. DH is a good dps spec and can be used almost everywhere without too much thought. Also berserker gear is easier to obtain than whatever chrono needs right now. If you need the thrill, do chrono. If you want an easy start, do dh.
---
Hehe maybe
---
Let's not say things we can't take back. 
---
I'm in love with female Asura voice, cuteness, fashion and animations. I love being tiniest and I LOVE their ear animation in fight stance. Also they have the best dance. Unfortunately my main is ranger/druid and medium armor doesnt look good on them but heavy and light armors are really good. [Here's my cutie :3](https://pasteboard.co/HVRyZYX.png) And [this is her old style :33](https://pasteboard.co/HVRzPie.png) And [my other cutie my new revenant/renegade :3](https://pasteboard.co/HVRABV0.png) 
---
Skritt are gross af, but they have their place. 
---
&gt; but if it did not damage anything else or anyone else,it is safe to assume that it would have not dispersed around the world.
---
You know, Zhaitan's and Mordremoth's magic dispersed to the world, harming it, but didn't show any obvious signs until there was just too much. Jormag's and Primordus' magic spreading into the world would take the same effect, in all honesty, and it was after Flashpoint that we started getting creatures going insane from ley energy.
---
&gt; About The All,it just seems like a huge scapegoat,since it shows circles much,much larger than those of the Elder Dragons,thus implying that their role isn't as large as we make it out to be.
---
Erm... [Not really.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGytoNXk8). When we witness The All, there are seven spheres - one large one with several rings (the world), and six smaller ones with smaller rings (Elder Dragons).
---
The 2d representation does have other circles, but when we witness The All itself, these are transparent, unimportant pieces.
---
&gt; About Replacements,i still wonder how hard it would have been for each god to take up an Elder Dragon s Role,seeing as the gods mostly match each other(Primordus and Balthazar,Mordremoth and Melandru,Zhaitan and Grenth,Kralkatorrik and Lyssa,Water Dragon and Dwayna(presumably,water and all being a symbol of healing). 
---
No, for multiple reasons.
---
First off, the Elder Dragons and Six Gods do not line up. There is nothing relating Kralkatorrik to Lyssa other than the color purple, which would also be relating every Elder Dragon but Jormag to Lyssa and Abaddon. And there is nothing water related about Dwayna's Life (while Mordremoth is called Life, but is plantlife). Besides which, with the exception of Melandru and Grenth, you're relating secondary domains that have been seen changing from god to god.
---
Balthazar is War/Conflict. Dwayna is Life. Melandru is Nature. Dhuum/Grenth is Death. Lyssa is Beauty. Abaddon/Kormir is Knowledge. Ice, water, healing, order - these things are all seen moving about the gods as is, and it's no doubt that fire and chaos (the best closeness to Primordus and Kralkatorrik) would too.
---
Secondly, ArenaNet [outright stated there is no relation between gods and dragons](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/494601/#Comment_494601).
---
Thirdly, if Balthazar could replace an Elder Dragon, our reason to stop him **wouldn't exist**. The entire reason we were out to stop him was because he couldn't replace an Elder Dragon. Because he is foreign to the world and system.
---
Fourthly, there are dozens of indications that divine and dragon magic are counteractive. From Kormir's protection spell over Sun's Refuge, to Divine Fire in Season 2, to the Foefire and Exalted being immune and countering dragon corruption. Even the Bloodstone, which seems largely invisible to the Elder Dragons and their minions without directly seeing them, are stated to be made using divine resources in HoT.
---
&gt; I sincerely doubt Balthazar would have let Tyria die,i mean sure he did not care much for it since everyone was opposing him,but after all he is the only god that we know of so far who descended in battle with his followers when they beckoned him.
---
Balthazar: Your kind will not stop my campaign.
---
&lt;Character name&gt;: Balthazar! What you're doing... You'll destroy Tyria!
---
Balthazar: Your home is a trivial concern.
---
Balthazar: They abated me, dimmed my light... But they will see me now.
---
He literally says, before "everyone was opposing him" that he doesn't give a shit about Tyria.
---
Also, Dwayna, Abaddon, and Grenth all came to mortals who called for their aid during plights. Not just Balthazar (who obviously would show up during a battle given he's the god of conflict). Kormir also granted sanctuary for her people for a short time after becoming a goddess.
---
if you look at the noteable deaths of major characters in gw2 you've got our death in pof (which we instantly recovered from) and now aurene. all the other characters we barely had an emotional connection with.
---
I’m extremely glad there’s no particle effects for this. Let it be a prestige item and speak for itself without cluttering the screen, particle effects would only ruin the clean look of the radiant one.
---
What are you on about living world releases every two to three months this timetable has not changed until Anet makes an official statement the timetable for releases is two to three months. 
---
Like I commented on the previous guys: “I made each Legendary specifically what I liked most. I have a very snow-themed character so frostfang for example fits better than astralaria, and so on. So I really don’t see a point in crafting the other (which more me fit less and are aesthetically uglier). And as said in the description I really don’t care about the aquatic, so will never be a goal for me ;-)
---
Next expansion, the patch note will read:
---
&gt;We've added a new condition to the game, named "Bareness". When an enemy applies Bareness to you, you'll loose all the defensive properties of currently worn armour, weapons, runes and sigils for its duration.
---
No joke, I'd love to see this condi in PvP. Would make guardian and necro a lot easier to deal with.
---
Skrit! I'm hit! Is the best voice line in the game. 
---
There are people who are purposefully clearing the event so people can't get the AP....this has always been a stupid design ANET....
---
who says aurene needs to be alive to replace kralk????
---
but in all seriousness just because she's dead doesn't mean we can't use anything from her, not her "pure" brand crystals, not her remains, not the magical connection she had with us and others
---
How did u the 4mobs thing? 
---
I think they might want to add more texture to some undies to prevent human female nude illusions. 
---
xbox did just get keyboard and mouse support so, maybe?, mean im pc player so doubt id play it there but option for it has increased
---
&gt; I think it accounts for any you already have unlocked already.
---
I can confirm that it does give you a discount for episodes you already own. I just paid 480 gems to unlock the 3 episodes that I missed in S3.

I honestly don't know my *actual* usage statistics other than the beetle being really low. In terms of *preference* however it's pretty clear:
---
* Jackal top dog. Besides just being way cooler with the teleport it's fast on autorun, can negate fall damage to itself, can change the direction of "jumps" in midair and most importantly for everyday use its movement skill works uphill.
---
* Griffon might be my most *used* mount though, because its freedom of movement is simply miles above the others. Since the nerf boosted dives are a little clunky but it can still cheese most HoT glides without updrafts, scale many walls with a built-in safety net (and no swap cooldown if you need to move horizontally) plus it gets a ridiculous amount of evade frames while flapping.
---
* Springer for high jumps obviously, great for vistas and of course cheesing jumping puzzles. Also deals the highest breakbar damage IIRC
---
* I really, *really* like the Skimmer's visual design but it just feels so *slooow* on land compared to the Jackal. And most water content in this game is *under*water not at the surface, so it's mostly relegated to daily Siren's Landing harvests and exploring certain maps.
---
* Raptor feels bland and boring compared to the others. Also rather clunky to control compared to the Jackal, in no small part because it uses the cartoony "leap" physics (i.e. you drop like a coyote once the leap ends and lose most of your forward momentum). Still, on flat ground two leaps get you further than even *four* Jackal ports so it's better for burst travel like gathering runs. And the 10 target pull is incredible at smashing trash mobs.
---
* And then we have the beetle. Slow, clunky, complex mechanics that aren't worth learning for anything other than dedicated race courses. Even with the Vigor mastery you're very likely to run into an obstacle, event, gathering node or some other reason to dismount and lose all speed *and* endurance. For longer distances there will be a much closer waypoint or so much verticality you can't even build speed to begin with. Losing speed uphill and completely random "ramp effectiveness" (both crossing chasms and regaining endurance via tricks) on many objects just kill it for me. I suppose it *would* make travel an interesting experience if you put in the time to master it, but the reward does not seem worth the effort compared to waypointing and playing whatever content you were headed to in the first place.

Basically you get 2 stats in pvp. Amulet give you the usual power/precision/ferocity etc etc. Having armor gives armor values but they are all the same, doesn't matter if is ascended or basic.
---
So as long as you have armor on all your slots, doesn't matter if is the 5 copper white rarity one or 50g ascended gear. You are the same as others.
---
Crafted the Greatsword and can confirm that the Infusion Slots are missing.
---
I thought some people got it already when you could get the achievement skins with the skin unlocker from blc for a short time until they fixed it
---
Damn I was gonna post this joke
---
Hahaha fair point
---
Honestly? I think her death is going to tie into how she's going to absorb his magic
---
When ppl die in tyria, they end up somewhere in the mists, glint included. What if we go fight kralk, and kill him in the mists, and while doing so, very dead aurene shows up and abrobs his magic, while still dead.
---
This could either be how she resurrects, or she absorbs his magic, but stays dead and can't leave the mists, bringing balance to tyria but never being able to be apart of it again 
---
That's actually a fun event idea.
---
Thank you.
---
Aurene's death does not invalidate the emotional build up spent since Season 3. Nor would her resurrection invalidate her death.
---
A death only invalidates emotional build up if it's contrived and non-consequential, or that emotional build up failed to get people invested (like so many Orr deaths).
---
Her resurrection would only invalidate her death if it was done quickly and without showing the consequences to her death.
---
I just hope we don't resurrect her in the very next episode. Even if it's at the very end, I feel that would be too quick to really show the consequence of her death - unless we get some juicy Side Story update in the middle. But a solid allusion to the possibility of bringing back Aurene at the end of episode 6 could work.
---
"More come, yes?" killing Skritt makes me sad.  
---
&gt;You cannot program an "auto-clicker" macro that, for instance, opens chests while you play elsewhere, or that opens a quantity of chests with a single click.
---
This is from the old policy: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/352/policy-third-party-programs-multi-boxing-macros
---
Although frankly I've never heard anyone banned from autoclicking bags anyway, and I know at least a few people that have been using it for years.
---
Something I didnt understand about those signs, it was made clear earlier that Glint couldnt see the future after a certain point, aka her death. So where do these signs come from ? Did  Kralk told Glint, "hey i saw a futur without me and here are all the signs of my demise ...."?
---
Aurene and Kralkatorik switched bodies
---
Anyone knows why they don't want you to bind doidge or jump to multiple keys ? I'm curious. 
---
Good times.. There is something fun about beta for AAA MMOs, most of the time people are just excited, generally helpful and confused at the same time. Plus it's all new and exciting. 
---
That's why I said what I did.
---
I'm more concerned about this part in multiboxing section:
---
"Multi-boxing may ONLY be used in PvE areas. You are not permitted to run multiple accounts simultaneously in PvP, WvW, activities, or in other competitive environments."
---
I got the intention but if this also contains private arenas I will be very angry.
---
I believe this is the correct answer. Entities and things native to the loop cannot deviate from the loop. It’s a closed system.
---
We can enter and exit loops on a whim simply because we are not bound by any specific loop in the mists. Like one can reread a book, stop and start at will. Skip ahead or backtrack (to a degree). We simply observe. 
---
Ghosts in the mists are different than people in a fractal loop. Like us, they are not bound by the cosmic highlight reel
---
RIP (legally) farming Keg Brawl wins (or some other activities' achievements) at night I guess.
---
Think it's the 6 year birthday gift.

---
&gt; they cant come up with anything better
---
I doubt this, and I'm sure this is setting up for something bigger, or else a lot of people are going to be really mad. I mean, this last instance was so easy, it didn't really feel like the sort of thing that a penultimate fight against a major boss has felt like.
---
Private arenas are competitive, they are just not rated play. Part where they don't care that people match-manipulate them is other thing.
---
Judging by the plates on the knees, I believe this is the commemorative armor you get on your character's 6th birthday.
---
Mhhhm ty, thats why i can't preview it lol
---
That’s cool. Where was that video shot and how does his game look so smooth and detailed? Some kind of Reshade setup?
---
Well when you have almost 1500 li you know all mechanics in raids ;-) except for chrono, because who plays chrono right
---
They are not threatened because they can flee from one threatened world into another threatened world? 
---
It was possible for certain creatures to devour ghosts before, now there's an entire dragon capable of entering their domain.
---
When the new PvP season starts?
---
Fair enough but this loops back around to the original question: Is death consequential? In this case, it isn't. Death and life are indistinguished. Whether someone dies or not isn't a problem. It's just whether or not Kralkatorrik is killed.
---
Maybe I just need to get on the dang dog, and see what he'll do, huh! 
---
HoT specialization collections all include a mystic weapon that requires 30 mystic coins. PoF collections are much cheaper.
---
Yeah, I stopped playing on my humans for the story.  Now I play on my female Norn.  During the final fight, she sounded absolutely vicious, like she was so angry at Kralk she was frothing at the mouth.  Super good voice acting this episode.
---
You're right of course.
---
I was only thinking of the Envoys.
---
Is this in game where?
---
At this point the problem isn't "Oh no, Aurene died", it's "Oh no, do we have a way of bringing her back?"
---
I'm assuming she wouldn't be much help in a "ghost" form, since Glint is just a floaty wisp
