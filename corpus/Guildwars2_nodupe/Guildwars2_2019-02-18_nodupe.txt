That's like prime time on the other side of the world. Unless you're in EU wherein most players are in neighboring countries and the time variance isn't as wide.

Exactly he had the superior team members. But i was superior to him. Proven by the duel that both started with full hp and equal cd’s. So it was a fair 1v1 and he lost the duel and didnt decap.  even when he had advantage by not having to defend a node ( which was an handicap for me, cuz it didnt allow for me to chase him freely, untill hes dead) so he could move freely to create openings for himself to engage while i was staying inside node. But alas even that didnt help him win the duel.
---
actually imo it shouldnt matter where in the mists kralkatorrik is - mists is not the all. if he is not in the all, world should be imbalanced. i don't think it's stated anywhere that "being in the mists that are close to tyria" (is that even a thing) counts as being in the all
---
There are more skeletons on Earth than living humans!!
---
What part of that post is disconnected with reality?
---

---
The short term profit driven mindset of the games industry at large, Anet included?
---
Or that it a native solution isn't easy to implement?
---
That the devs would probably like to see it happen? Because that's been my experience talking with devs in general. They want what's best for the game, and feel for a lot of community suggestions - but a lot of the time, they don't get to decide what gets worked on.
---
I may have written that post when I was annoyed and sleep deprived, and it obviously shows, but it was an attempt to have a real dialogue and propose an alternative explanation. Not that Anet was just lying, nor was the difficulty of implementation the whole story. Yeah, it would have been a technical challenge, and that's not really disputable. But the games industry solves technical challenges all the time, and this one is clearly solvable. It almost certainly isn't impossible like a lot of fanboys make it out to be. So why haven't they solved it?
---
Because there's no immediate return for the cost.
---
That is the crux of the whole post. "Game company makes bad decision based off of short sighted greed. More news at 11." The overwhelming short sighted greed of the game industry seems like one of the few things most gaming communities can almost universally agree on. So I have to say, I'm kinda surprised that I ate such shit.
---
I guess I can only attribute that to trying to articulate that point when I was annoyed and very tired. Or, you know, I'm just a delusional moron. Could go either way.
---
As someone who has heard many 50-something hillbilly chain smokers, I don't know what you're talking about. Female charr sound great, esp compared to some of the other gender/race combos.
---
And there's just enough free space left to include a Tengu if the race every becomes playable. 
---
Let me dream my doomed dream!
---
But seriously, beautiful work. I love the composition of the first image, but the personality in the second is great. So much can be seen from a still image sometimes. 
---
Your most recent reply is on quite a different tone than your first one, wouldn’t you agree ? ;) it is as if you spoke emotionally and not through rationality initially 🤠
---
... what I'd love to see is something like more like Crowfall. :P 
---
Not being a dick in another thread and getting ALL ur posts down voted for lols 
---
The flexibility of the meta is nice.
---
The story has always been wanting, IMO, but it's gotten better where WoW has gotten worse.
---
And the metas for the HoT maps capture everything I've ever wanted from an MMO.
---
The fact that old materials are always relevant. Content is never truly outdated.
---
Normally I'd add that "all the maps feel alive" but this is becoming less and less true, and I hope they tackle that problem soon.
---
Sunswept isles has a event good for 40+k with map buffs in 20 mins, unless it got nerfed. Thats my go to if im in need of a quick karma boost. 
---
I miss being able to use Heal Area.
---
I like the top one the most. The bottom one has harsher shading that doesnt fully match the scenery around it. Great work on both 10/10
---
Thanks for your help but none of it worked.
---
I thought the Asura was a Chua from Wildstar in the first pic.  Much better rendition in the second one :)
---
Thank you, that pretty much nails my problems and dislike with the original. My screen wasn't properly calibrated at the time, so the darks are far harsher on other screens than what I saw. Colors are also not as wide as I would like either.
---
The figures were also drawn started from gesture drawings and built from there. With the newer drawing, everything is built up from simple silhouette to figure out if the pose and composition is strong/natural or not. 
---
What is a supermarket?
---
thank you 
---
thanks!
---
And yet again, Cantha intensifies.
---
Disagree.
---
What are you guys soending your karma on?
---
What I'd say is that the fight was more complex than I initially thought, definitely. I'll admit to that 100%. 
---
 My initial conclusion that he gained a bigger advantage for his team by being able to 1) not die in the 1v1 and 2) allow his team to get stillness, still stands. 
---
I'm still not convinced that he didn't make an intentional choice to try to get you to rotate reactively. 
---
BUT, what I did not take into account initally (and things that talking to you did make me re-consider) were 1) cooldowns, 2) disparity in strategy between the rest of the team members, 3) that you felt that holding the node was the better choice and that was intentional as well. 
---
I made the first one because I wanted a nice painting of my OC's to be printed and mounted in my work room. Time passes and now I hate the painting. So I'm re-doing the whole project to have a nice print for myself. 
---
Because projectiles shot without a target are aimed by your camera, and your camera is faced very downward.
---
I like that i'm not sure if you're referring to sylvari or the tonic, that's how pro-tree-rp this game is
---
Factions is my jam. That was the expansion where I really fell into GW and ultimately found out about digital illustration and art. 
---
The OG campaigns, particularly Factions, holds a special place in my heart. 
---
Had to look that up, but I see the similarities between the two technologically advanced rodent gremlins. 
---
How inspiring! Makes me wanna finish work and draw something fun 
---
It's a camera thing. I am one of those many engi mains that want that skill reworked into something akin to Phoenix targeting (the ele skill on scepter). Current implementation is very unreliable.
---
You seem to lack understanding of the meta.
---
Ele and scrapper are meta wvw supports as +1s to FB. Both are run in gvg comps because they are completely busted.
---
Sure the superspeed nerf hurt scrapper a little but the change on antitoxin runes pushed scrapper into complete absurdity. Ele as well with its 1.2k res as well as ridiculous immob output are crazy good. Check out Crann’s stream vods on twitch to see just what a good player (and tbh he’s probs the best) can do with ele in wvw.
---
Also your comments about adding damage to scrapper are... interesting. Scrapper has two viable ways of playing - damage/bruiser and support. Anet simply buffed the damage/bruiser playstyle, which is good because it’s fun in pvp. 
---
I have also heard word that anet does plan to make some more changes to scrapper, particularly relating to superspeed. 
---
You should relax a bit. 
---
Thanks again!
---
Was planning on joining but something came up, have fun!
---
Never a better time than now. 
---
How well done Nightmare and Shattered Observatory fractals are. The T4 difficulty of these is what I feel the standard of instanced content should be, while the challenge mode should be what challenging group content should be like.  
---
These 2 fractals are my favorite part of the game, but unfortunately ANet isn't interested in this type of content. They focus too much on story and open world which have poor encounter design, raids aren't accessible, and fractal design since these has been going downhill.  
---
can you tell us why?
---
80% of my friends list doesn't play anymore. The only ones I actively talk to are in my guild or maybe I run into one in wvw. I've been playing for 5 years so it's bound to happen. I don't enjoy talking much when some friends come back for a few weeks because I know they'll be gone again soon. :/
---
At least my guild plays other games with me. 
---
The story and the fact that I don't feel like I'm punished for not logging on every day.

Character is my Charr Warrior Umbral Embrace, undoubtedly pondering the current world-ending crisis on her plate.
---
Nah, the new one is miles better. The values and the colors you chose are just another level, plus the composition. The first one also has proportion hiccups that in the new one are gone. 
---
It's less rendered, but it's already far more beautiful. Especially the upper left Charr and the clouds in the middle. LOVE the colors and framing.

Sorry mate I wont stop, playing the tp is my fun in game :)))

Is it usable for Mac?

---
How so?  If the game was able to run anything higher than DX9 natively, the game would run smoothly.
---
People really don't give a shit whether the game is technically well optimized or not, what they care about is how it runs in practice. Going "aaakshually..." is, like I said, a pointless distinction.
---
Playing from South East Asia and coming from a long line of Korean and Chinese MMOs:
---
• No lag (compared to other NA MMOs I've played)
---
• No grind
---
• No RNG drop BiS equipments
---
• No pay to win
---
• Equal footing PvP (I don't understand why they don't normalise equips for WvW as well, I would be more active in WvW if they did). 
---
• No subscription 
---
• Gold to Gem conversion (and vice versa). Legit conversion option helps keep gold sellers to a minimum. 
---
• Convenience and fun focused. Eg. Deposit to mat storage, TP accessible from anywhere. Minimal old school questing system. 
---
• Warm and helpful community 
---
• World detail. Devs put their hearts in creating the game, I'm always reminded of that when admiring Troll's Revenge JP, the old school way. 
---
• Fun combat. Easy to pick up but hard to master. 
---
• Sheer amount of different playstyles for the game. If I burn out from high end PvE, I can chill with some map completion. If I'm tired of a peaceful life, I can hop in for some PvP. There's also mini games, collections, achievements and of course fashion wars :)
---
• Nice story telling with **amazing** cutscenes. Anet needs to produce an animation, like ASAP. 
---
• Affordable Fashion Wars. In other MMOs I've played, one had to pay real money just to change dyes...
---
My only critique of the game is the state of fractals atm. I feel the fractal team (or their bosses) have lost sight of what makes fractal popular in the first place.  They used to be quick, challenging and rewarding. 
---
It's not a matter of git gud. I have 11 fractal builds (all fully ascended with 150+ AR) spread among various classes and can handle all instabilities thrown at me, it's just no longer fun to play. I'm always happy to see when it's only old instabilities for the day, and no Siren Reef heh. 
---
Delete Slippery Slope, Birds and new SA. New SA because not only does it artificially prolongs the fractal (eg. Platforming), it can also interferes with skill casting sometimes. Plus, people prone to motion sickness (like me) can get nauseous from too much SS and/or SA. 
---
Fractal is my main game mode, what attaches me to the game. If it continues to go downhill so will my interest to log in, despite all the perks listed. 
---
No they don't, but it's just sad how misinformed people are.
---
Do you have to target a mob in the back for it to pierce? 
---
Honestly, I think it's just all the quality of life features. They make me realize how much they matter whenever I try playing a different game.

Thanks, this helps a lot.

Do you have LS4 Chapter 1? You need to progress the story to take the boat to Istan the first time.

people, stop overhyping yourselves
---
First one looks like a concept for zhe second.
---
What I like most of both is the overall bright hue and the enthusiastic vibes the characters are spreading. Bonus points for the perspective of the second.
---
I really appreciate the contrast to most “mystic/shadowy“ images we see here most of the time.
---
I feel like I am missing something here?? 😂
---
So let's break it all down real slow like since that is the pace we're setting here. I never provided direct source for anything that I was first positing about my preferences for the design of Mordremoth, so if you interpreted them as facts, it's only through your own perspective and not an empirically measured one. We can quantify the western to eastern designs in level of importance with time shown in game and influence on the world setting. Let's look at your proposed eastern designs. One is a mini that is completely irrelevant to the game within its official capacity of what exists and what doesn't. Within the scope of the perception of the characters for the story, it's not like Rytlock or Kasmeer see little minis following the Commander around. Officially for the setting of the world, they don't really exist. The celestial dragon is only relevant during the Lunar New Year festival, directly from the wiki, "Celestial Dragons are entryways into Divinity's Reach during the Lunar New Year festival. Players travelling via them arrive at the Crown Pavilion Waypoint." 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celestial_Dragon
---
That's it, full stop. Really measures up to importance compared to the Elder Dragons, huh? (sarcasm, of course.) One non-existent promo item and another as a festival flavor piece. Kuunavang has wings so it doesn't lend itself to traditional eastern design for no wings and spontaneous flight. It is not a Chinese dragon. Not a single one has wings.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kuunavang
---
 The Mouth of Mordremoth is really the only card you have to play for a definitive eastern dragon design of canonical importance within GW2. Let's take a look at the rest.
---
Starting from the beginning with our ole boy Zhaitan and his most notorious World Boss lieutenant, Tequatl. Take a look at the concept art and in game models. Both sport wings and front forearms with claws, and Tequatl has the full six appendage design with back legs as well. Much more western than eastern.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zhaitan
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tequatl_the_Sunless
---
Next let's take a look at a more here and there in appearances, Primordus. Not really any in game models that show his whole body but a very definitive piece of info in reference to this screenshot that call's back to GW1:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Dragon_01_concept_art_(Destroyer_Dragon).jpg
---
Straight from the wiki in the trivia section, "Primordus's appearance in Guild Wars 2 is drastically different from its first appearance in Guild Wars: Eye of the North. This is because, according to developers, there is ambiguity about whether the dragon seen awakening at the end of the Eye of the North was supposed to be the real Primordus or one of its champions.[9] Despite this, there were multiple interviews with Jeff Grubb during promotions for Guild Wars 2's release that stated Primordus was the statue, and there are a multitude of direct comments stating Primordus woke up next to the Central Transfer Chamber, just as that dragon in Guild Wars is."
---
A little more ambiguous than the other's but the screenshot sports the same forearm with claw and very empowering wingspan, very nice art, very ***western*** design. His lieutenants are neutral in the eastern/western comparison as they appear more insect-like but they do have wings as well.
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Great_Destroyer
---
Next is Jormag, and his boi, The Claw. For Jormag himself they don't really have an in-game model but the concept art used and the Sons of Svanir emblem all have wings, bar none. The Claw himself is extremely able to be classified as the western design with a similar makeup to Teqautl of front and hind legs as well as wings. Moving on.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jormag
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Claw_of_Jormag
---
AND NOW we come to the piece de resistance, Kralkatorrik and his relatives, The Shatterer, Aurene, Vlast, and the lovely Glint. Given that we have had a lot of recent exposure to very definitive appearances for these dragons in recent times, they make an overwhelmingly strong case. Most recent living story we get to see Glint's actual dead body if the previous screen times weren't enough. (IF you actually play and care about the game.) The aspect of her for the Revenant class elite skill uses wings for it's knockback, very nice. We have known for a awhile what Aurene looks like of course, no discord there as to appearance. Gleam is essentially identical in appearance with a slightly more masculine design of course for snout and body structure. Now for our main man Kralkatorrik. I think the most poetic description for him comes from one of the books, Edge of Destiny, also found on the wiki for reference. 
---
"Across the ridge, spikes of stone flexed slowly.
---
Rocks sloughed from scaly ribs.
---
Talons cracked out of bedrock.
---
The dragon rose from the mountain.
---
It was the biggest living thing Ferroc had ever seen. It was the mountain—a thousand feet high with a wingspan that shadowed the world.
---
Main relevant mentions being wingspan, as if the silhouette from the Living Story wasn't enough evidence. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kralkatorrik
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glint
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aurene
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vlast
---
This is fact. This is evidence in direct relation to the game shown in indisputable detail that the idea of western dragon design is far more prevalent within the game and the world it presents. Mordremoth does not follow the extreme amount of precedent set by all these designs and therefore is an outlier. 
---
How's that for trolling? https://imgur.com/otJ5Fz8
---
**Chinese dragon**
---
Chinese dragons, also known as East Asian dragons, are legendary creatures in Chinese mythology, Chinese folklore, and East Asian culture at large. Chinese dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish, but are most commonly depicted as snake-like with four legs. They traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, typhoons, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck for people who are worthy of it in East Asian culture.

I'll add Bloodstone Fen to the list for the stat changeable ascended trinkets. Sure rubies are a pain to farm, but saving inventory slots is worth it for me. My mesmer for example has 3 different  sets of equipments.

Same graphics settings as before but seeing a pretty nice performance boost using this. I'd run 60fps leveling / open world with dips to the 40s with stuff going on. Now running steady 60fps.

No, you don't need to target the mob at the back for your Rifle 2 to pierce, but your Rifle 2 only pierce up to 5 mobs at a time in a straight line.

The bottom is the new one? I've seen it on Deviant Art 1-2 years ago.
---
Oh look it's a sapling

If only we can make those sexy eyes

And explain me please, why you shouldn't be able to do exactly that? 
---
I have over 15k hours in GW2 and I'm willing to bet a minimum of 9k has been spent exclusively in WvW.  
---
There have been many matches I haven't enjoyed and many metas I've loathed but friends, a sense of community and every fight being a little different than the last always keep me coming back.  
---
I enjoy being able to do as I please, when I please and I enjoy not feeling like I'm chasing a carrot on a stick. I don't have long term goals. The only thing I aim to achieve when I sign on is get in to as many fights as I can, to learn from every encounter and to laugh with friends. That to me is what makes WvW worth coming back to every day.  
---
I understand some people can't find enjoyment without purpose but in my perspective, grind and rewards are always secondary to my fun. That's why when I PvE, I can't stay interested. I don't feel like I belong to a community. I've done this rotation on this mob many times before. I don't care what items are dropped or what metas spawn. I have no connection to the world so I have no motivation to participate in it.
---
It gets some hate I feel like, due to its lack luster secondary control point, but overall it is a beautiful PvP map. 
---
&gt; That mes I think is actually 10k 
---
That account was banned a couple weeks ago. He's on Mez You Up More now.

Thanks! Being able to leave things rough and knowing when to hold back on detail has always been something I struggled with. Only recently been able to do that, and it's still a struggle to fight that part of your brain that wants to detail everything. 
---
Sorry how is scrapper absurd? Did i miss something?
---
The foundation of the game. From real-life elements such  as no server downtime or no monthly fees to in-game QoL such as deposit all materials, access to the Trading Post from anywhere in the game or no node, XP or loot stealing.
---
It's just super convenient.
---
Also, charr and mount running animations.
---
I am trying to make an Alex Mercer (From Prototype) cosplay but i can't!
---
How is that staff tempest a bad build? The spec and weapon underperform but it's not like you randomly selected traits and gear. 
---
Never increasing the level cap and ascended tier equipment being the best stat wise for many many years. 
---
weird question, is this usable with overlay? like the geforce overlay
---
Ah, my GW related fanart days are mostly behind me. Most of my art time is either consumed by portfolio/job related work or developing my own original illustrations and stories.

Anet doesn’t care. They are trash anyways. The game is in a bad state but anet is blind. 
---
Haven't fully made one yet to test but *Support soulbeast* for meta events.
---
Uses the boon berserker base but in **Diviner Gear**.
---
Nature magic for warhorn recharge, number of boons increase DMG and spirits give out boons.
---
Soulbeast stance trait to give wolf pack to friends, and maybe vulture stance.
---
Utility: water spirit and your choice of spirits. Sun and frost for dps, storm for fury and cc. Moa stance for boons, vulture stance for poison and might and one wolf pack for burst.
---
Dps: you are probably gonna be 'that soulbeast doing 4k'
---
Celestial Firebrand with Balthazar Runes and Sigil of Smoldering for extra Burning duration (my main for open world/story). Very good damage compared to my other Celestials. Easy to tag every Champ in Istan thanks to unlimited cc break and condi cleanse with Mantras, it's unstoppable and lives forever.
---
Wings don't store things very well
---
Maps get stale because rewards balance is awful.
---
There are two reasons to do something (in terms of rewards and progression) in this game. You either need an activity specific currency (map currencies, magnetite shards, dungeon tokens, etc.), or you need gold.
---
Activity specific currencies are inherently limited in their usefulness, as they're only used for specific things associated with the activity. This means that they aren't needed if you don't need "the thing" they buy or if you already obtained the thing. For the people who want "the thing", this is what leads to awful time gating since ANet doesn't want the map to be immediately stale but there's no actual reason to be there once you finish getting "the thing".
---
On the other hand, gold income for the overwhelming majority of content in this game is abysmal. Unlike the perfectly rational economic beings that many people use as actors when criticizing GW2's "gold is everything" economic model, people *do* play content that isn't the absolute number one most efficient farm in the game. However, it needs to be at least in the same ballpark. A difference of a few gold per hour is fine - a total reward of some greens and blues is not.
---
From left to right: weird tip - recorder - grip - recorder

Leech has seperated scaling for damage and heal.

Former is affected by Power latter is affected by Healing Power

it's about reacting to what other people are doing ..  not just dodge  your block your aegis all that count if u press the perfect time.
---
i'm pretty average at this game but i still get to plat 2 every time.
---
so tell me what are the other 80-90% of people doing in lower tier ?
---
maybe including you as well ?    if the combat is so easy
---
i didn't say combat was easy, read again 
---
Ah, I am not too familiar with WvW. However, that sounds rather fun to play. I havn't really thought of playing power renegade. Thanks for sharing!
---
Ah, the good old days back when Condi DD DAGGER 3 spam was the only acceptable build to play. I remember the good old times with backflipping into a firewall. I loved every second it. Thanks for the nostalgia. 
---
I just want them to balance the game mode in a way that each class is providing some unique, instead of what we have now where taking x class over y class is just gimping yourself 
---
 "Some folks reported this, but still no clue on origins, as they are almost all are not repeatable.
---
* Everyone is ReShaded and gw2hooked."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Can somebody explain what this means? Because I can't get gw2hook and dx912pxy to work together.
---
Also, is it possible to request for an easy on/off switch for dx912pxy? Because I can't run this tool when I'm multi-boxing or the clients will all slow to a 1FPS crawl due to resource bottleneck. I'll like an option to easily turn this on and off so i can run this tool when WvW-ing on my main account, and then turning it off when farming on dual accounts.
---
Thanks and great work\~
---
\&gt; PPT enabled (not just captured but held after we captured it)
---
this doesn't work, my guild can capture stuff now, then log off and unrelated people spend the next 5 hours defending it like mad, but then we get credit? 
---
I mean I like the idea in general because it will give guilds something to get hyped about as well as something they can note down as needing improvement. Also I'm honestly worried about Anet putting even more strain on their servers by recording extra metrics considering how laggy things can get right now. Unless they already have this info right now, but it's just not surfaced to the player in a presentable form.
---
Introducing the Diviner's Wellomancer build. Here's a [link.](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vREQNBhODbkkGasxeawlGYvxSugBFAaArgprwSYKEXF7ijRA-jBSBQBBW5nxeCAUSlAAcRA6ruh/quDR2fQwKBDAcAc+5ZezDO/8zP/8z76zP/8zP/8zP/8zLFQET2A-e)
---
So this build is very fractal-based, and is intended to carry struggling fractal parties in T3 for the lulz. Thus, it aims for 100% boon duration to share out some boons, while not gimping its DPS too much so it can still be of use. This means my reaper build is pretty boon independent, and can help buff the party as well, namely with:
---
=
---
- Protection: Wells provide protection with the Vampiric Rituals trait, and I can provide perma-protection with up to 30 seconds at a pop.
---
- Might: I can provide 11 stacks of might for 15 seconds from Well of Power and Superior Rune of the Pack. I will also have perma 25 might on myself due to my traits.
---
- Fury: 15 seconds, thanks to the runes.
---
- Swiftness: Also 15 seconds.
---
- Quickness: Only for myself, but I can get 6 seconds in Reaper's Shroud every 3 seconds, so I can actually permabuff myself by going into shroud every so often.
---
- Regeneration: About 10 seconds of regen by dodging, thanks to Mark of Evasion.
---
- Vampiric Presence: Moar lifesteal!
---
Throw in the reaper's good CC abilities and you get a pretty fun memey build.
---
they were only ever about pre-stacking, and then it was only fire fields and blast finishers, nothing else mattered to the point people would avoid putting down any non-fire field to avoid screwing over the might stacker's blasts.
---
that Asura has seen some serious shit

Thanks for making me miss when flame thrower was slightly viable

X/axe condi ranger that focuses on whirl and projectile finishers to stack primarily burns.

I could quite happily pass up on the slow instanced PvE content release rate if we had support of character biographies / roleplay profiles (because I'd spend hours tweaking it) and proper PvE balance so that lots of different options were available for alac/quickness together and all healers could bring might. That variation would keep doing the same raids weekly fun.

I liked that build lol, so much aoe is nice in the open world. Used to play a similar build to it.
---
I gues you hate high insta sell prices...
---
i dont remember single instance you HAD to use combo fields. if we hadnt 3 supports classes with can hold 10000 boons alone than maybe,but i guess that train is long gone.
---
[Fractal meta](https://discretize.eu/builds) tends to run more damage and hybrid (DPS + boon) builds rather than dedicated healers but they are very common in pug groups. If you wanted to run a [boon healer druid](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/heal-druid) in fractals it's still a common addition. 
---
[Raid meta](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) always runs at least 1 healer in meta comps and usually 2 in pug comps with the first healer usually being druid (has a ton of damage buffs for the group including 25 stacks of might for 10 players). There are also other meta support/healers but no matter what you're trying to bring as much damage as you can while still doing your job. In terms of ranking the healers I'd say: 
---
1. [Druid](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/druid/heal/), is meta in every group. Usually full heal build but can go condition damage/support as a second healer or on low healing fights
---
2. [Renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/heal/)/[Firebrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/heal/) both have hybrid and heal builds so the comp can change as needed but they are run together to provide group quickness and alacrity meaning you can drop one or both chronomancers. Very strong meta choice but again you want to pair it with the other one so it takes a little coordination.
---
3. [Scourge](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/heal/), doesn't provide as much healing as other supports but gives a lot of barrier and is the best option for reviving downed teammates. Can carry under preforming groups.
---
4. [Tempest](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/heal/), great AoE healing over time with some burst options as well. Clears conditions and provides a lot of healing. Can even get decent damage if played well but doesn't provide the group DPS bonuses you'll find with other supports.
---
5. [Scrapper](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/scrapper/heal/), huge burst healing and condition conversion if specced for it but has lower AoE healing compared to tempest and no damage buffs. Is a very uncommon build to see, could have a hard time finding a group that would take you.
---
Also worth noting that while not a healer chornomancer is still a popular support for providing quickness and alacrity to the group.
---
Jumping puzzles and most world bosses give non-loot. World bosses specifically are really cool content that are almost universally a complete waste of time.
---
Every meta sans Istan from the PoF era doesn't just give blues and greens per se, but their rewards are atrocious including legitimate content like Serpent's Ire and the Death Branded Shatterer. Bounty trains should be a legitimate source of income as well.
---
It just feels like the best farms are so much better than all the other options that there's no point doing most of the content in the game. I would much rather if there was a general expectation that doing any major event yielded a roughly similar amount of money as that would lead to a lot more overall gameplay variety.
---
Ah, the reaper is here. Feels like any necro builds could have made it on to this thread to lol. 
---
Let the necro flame begin. 
---
Jk. 
---
A bit like the full support Scourge, but with minions and Zealot's gear. Impossible to die, enough damage to solo anything, and support for the people around me instead of boons. That is, I hope to prevent them from dying with barriers and easy, fast res when (not if) they die. I believe it's starting to gain traction because of a YTer.

I mention this time and time again, combo fields prioritization is so needed but more on the combo finishers.

Projectile would be nice if 100% ICD 1 sec so no spam. Must be consistent size and visibility for any projectile. Yes I'm sorry but even legendary projectile should be unified as color-coded comets (only when comboed) than UI unpolished mess that we have right now

We were taking about this yesterday in guild chat... The combat is one of the things that actually keeps people playing.

The issue with these pieces of feedback from mega-communities is that they're shoving everyone into the same barrel, "one size *must* fit all". Games are different precisely because different gamers need different things from them, and if you "fix" such issues, you won't magically get the most common gamers play everything - you'll just lose your market niches and turn all the games into the same one.
---
As someone who played condi reaper in pve while it was good and dreaded parties with guardians who'd without fail overwrite every ice field perfectly, pls no. So many ways combo fields being a bigger thing for anything but pre-stacking would go wrong.

Not could, would.

nah, remember when anet said the desert and alpine maps would be on a rotation?

this is the announcement, red is becoming alpine and blue and green are becoming desert

I'm still snickering at the thought of the announcement being, "Return of Golem Week!" and that's it.

I mean, it'll probably be more than that (maybe). But what can you do? We all love this game and our respective game modes and want to see even more amazing things happen to the thing we love.
---
It's more that combo fields have never been reliable. He's not saying what you're pretending he said. He's saying that because he's played something that did rely on combo fields, it wouldn't be a good idea for other classes to have to rely on them either.

Cool artwork! I'm not an art guy so i am already blown away by your first one, and the second has at least concept art levels of intricacy.
---
not reworking something because it would negatively impact a very niche build
---
*the very special gw2 community*, everyone 
---
I can see that this concept is too complex for you to understand, no problem
---
... you're joking right?
---
Apart from *pre-stacking* might, swiftness and stealth, blast finishers were often used to stack might *in-combat* (d/d ele, shoutbow war), stealth was also stacked *in-combat* (thief, engi, Druid, soulbeast) and pre mounts, swiftness was always stacked out of combat for movement.
---
You mention the *occasional* water field blast but it's aloooot more than occasional. Engi heal turret/ mortar 5/ gyro f1, staff ele, sword weaver as well as various classes blasting eke and engi water fields for heals.
---
Apart from what you mentioned, light field blasting by guardians and engineers with elixir gun was a method of condition cleanse and blasting lightning fields on scrapper was an important part of playing the class at one point.
---
That's just BLAST finishers as well.  Leap finishers were also useful mechanic on many classes. We have the classics thief d/p leap for stealth, shoutbow warrior leap through on firefield for damage, Mesmers used to phase retreat their chaos storm for chaos armour, scrapper hammer 3 through their gyro f1 skill or through their hammer 5 skill.
---
As for whirl finishers it's a lot less and I can only think of thief using warrior steal skill to whirl in black powder and scrapper hammer 2 whirl in various fields
---
they didnt, announcement is tuesday its just a joke
---
Exactly what I'm saying. 
---
As things stand currently there's way too many ways to have people step on each others' toes with how combo fields work. Even the solution of starting your finisher on the edge of the combo field you want only helps so much when a lot of times you can have party members drop much bigger fields.
---
If they rework how combo fields take finishers then maybe it'll be good, but the way things are now - pls no.
---
This is so stupid that it's already smart again.

hey that's sounds like some real progress there, good to hear!
---
okay so the next thing that I see here is swapping ascended weapon/armor stats to your first zerk set.
---
the recipe in the mystic forge is berserker's intricate gossamer insignia for armor (gold named exotic) and berserker's orichalcum imbued inscription for weapons (gold named exotic). So one of these depending on whether it's armor or weapon you will be swapping stats with + 5 globs of ectos + 1 [anthology of heroes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Anthology_of_Heroes) with 10 spirit shards (bought from miyani by the forge), and the ascended piece = bammm you have berserker's stats on them.
---
I suggest if you swap your axe and 2 armor pieces (armor stats heavy starting with chest piece &gt; pants &gt; helm &gt; shoulders = gloves = boots), that makes 3 pieces of ascended added to your set! 
---

---
&gt; I don't know, I just picked a few of the remarks towards GW2. Instead of blindly guessing, what would you want in this game to play it more ? Other games might have strong points, but not all of them can be applied to GW2. So, what do you aim for ?
---
Primarily, better PvP and this includes WvW. I would start with balance. It's downright insulting to see how Mirage, Firebrand, and Soulbeast trample all over the arenas while Renegade, Scrapper, or even Druid (which has received several nerfs) get dragged. I would get rid of the heavy stealth capabilities of deadeye as well, probably by adjusting the elite ability.
---
Second, I would want some more incentive to go back to a map (big, dynamic world events, like in Verdant Brink). It's a huge shame that a map like Draconis Mons seems to have just been ditched. I would also recommend that they try not to make a map too tied to the episode. I would much rather it be like the story just happens to be in that map rather than the map is created solely for the story. After finishing the story, the new map just isn't interesting to go back to IMO. And the overuse of branded crystals makes the map look dirtier if you ask me. Same with Bloodstone Fen (which was already mediocre if you ask me), no real reason to go back.
---
Lastly, I would promote more group content. A couple fractals and a raid per year just doesn't cut it in my opinion. To me, an efficient way to sort of help this problem, is by making the significant events of a story into a dungeon. Like I said previously, turning final parts of the recent story into a playable 5-man dungeon with some tweaks here and there. I would also fix the instabilities because I don't know ***anyone*** who wants to keep seeing those damned birds in fractals anymore.
---
Honestly I don't think open world is hard at all. You can get some difficulty in certain dungeon paths but even that isn't hard with proper builds and gear (even just for your level). Most of the actual difficult content comes from high tier fractals and raids for PvE. There was a noticeable step up in difficulty for the Heart of Thorns expansion areas too. It really does come down to your build, gear, and skill for what you find difficult though. Since you own the game and you have old characters (don't delete old characters) you'll get birthday gifts and boosters that can help you level quickly if you find the story + events of open world too easy and boring. I just leveled a fresh character the other day and it goes incredibly fast if you're using some boosters and tagging events (kill yellow mobs between events for the bonus exp they have if not killed in a while). Just doing the Modniir Ulgoth meta in harathi got me a bunch of levels. Also if you want hard content in core (I'm assuming you don't have the expansions) fractal level 99 and 100 both have challenge modes that are much harder than normal.   
---
I know, it's definitely a great fit for 'horrible build' heh
---
Yeah thats about my peak performance but i dont think stat infusions would make such a huge difference.

 Guys I bought PoF and used the lvl 80 boost on my Thief because i want to play with Deadeye, but im kinda lost now. Atm im farming HP to complete the traits, but besides that i dont know what to do. I have some questions to ask.  
---
\-- Is the lvl 80 boost gear any good?
---
 \-- What stats should i use and why? 
---
\-- How can i join fractal dungeons/Raids and do i get from them?
---
 \-- Should i complete the map besides the waypoints? 
---
\-- How can i get better gear?  
---
And ive seen some player with really cool wings, are those gliders? 
---
I once made a thread on DX10/DX11 support, devs replied that it will be too much work for too small performance income. I think that over time this reply becomes obsolete since DX9c is archaic as fuck.. And this won't change. It will get worse.
---
Imagine running crysis in windows 98SE with current gaming rig (if even drivers let you launch the os)

You just want to skip the hard work, and take the easy way out. I meet people like you all the time in real life, they always end up with egg on there face. Good luck with that karma.

I don't get the hate. Where's the NSFW?

Your static won't let you play non best in slot dps class so you come to reddit to complain and whine that they should buff the class you like to play so you can play them in your static.

If you're a DP thief and you're fighting a warrior then dropping a pistol #5 and spinning with F2 on top of the warrior is a pretty nice combo.
---
Light field blast granting condicleanse wasnt actually a thing until fairly recently, and balance hasnt really changed significantly since then. 
---
Why didn't a dh just camp scepter and take over the handkiter role?
---
Good to know and thanks for all your hard work :)
---
&gt; -- Is the lvl 80 boost gear any good?
---
Its good enough to do PvE with, but its far from optimal. 
---
&gt; -- What stats should i use and why? 
---
I believe you mostly see Berserker stats on Deadeye, but it depends on playstyle. Google ''gw2 deadeye build" + play style (as in ''pve'' or ''pvp'' whatever you want to focus on). You will find plenty of builds on metabattle describing what equipment people think is good (stats, skills, traits) for what playstyle (mobile or not, stealthed or simply high damage etc). I feel the need to remind tho, you never have to follow the exact described builds there. If you like a certain skill, use it ;)
---
&gt; -- How can i join fractal dungeons/Raids and do i get from them?
---
Fractals you can join through the portal in Lions Arch. Join groups through the looking for group menu. Fractals have a new element, agony, which is a damage type that you get in Fractals. I think this was implemented to make sure you progress through all Fractals instead of going to the hardest one immediately (?). 
---
Anyway find the lowest level Fractals first, play these. You will get good rewards (ascended trinkets, other gear, stuff you can sell). You will also get Agony Resistance infusions you can add to ascended trinkets. The more Agony Resistance you have, the higher level Fractals you can do (since without Agony Resistance you will most likely die instantly in higher level Fractals).
---
&gt; -- Should i complete the map besides the waypoints? 
---
Only if you feel like it ;) Guild Wars has beautifully designed maps with lots of fun events and surprising stories or area's to stumble on. Also its a fun way to just play and get some gold. Sure its not the most optimal way to farm gold but its not tiring like doing the same thing over and over. However, if your interest is in other parts of the game (raids, dungeons, fractals, w/e) you really dont ''need'' to complete the map. Ive played this game for 2+ years now and still havent 100% map completion on a single character. 
---
&gt; -- How can i get better gear? 
---
Buying them with gold, crafting them yourself through Armorsmith (heavy armor), leatherworking (medium armor) and tailoring (light armor). Look at the [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crafting) for more info.
---
&gt; ​And ive seen some player with really cool wings, are those gliders? 
---
Some are just backpack skins, some are backpack and glider combo ([example](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hawk_Wings_Glider_Combo_\(statuettes\)))
---
The top image is their album cover. The bottom one is the image they use next to the interview.  
---
Both are brilliant! :)
---
The second one also feels more dynamic...a scene straight from (their fictional) reality, whereas the first one feels like an old painting of some legend or other, explaining the different races.
---
The thing with heal warrior is that you either make it run the meta banners wiht one shout, giving him barely any heal output or you run a bs plus heal warrior with toughness banner. At this point the only thing he does is cc, making the group a bit tankier and removing some condis while having no improved rezz potential. I'd rather have a scourge who does all of that but way better.
---
That feel when Dark+Whirl=leeching bolt is nice dps boost that made reapers benchmarks boosted when it was finetuned to that.
---
Or condi reaper where chilling bolts is essential part of dps rotation (and not getting cleansed)
---
Then you go to raids and you get cleansing bolts because reasons 🤔

I just came back to the game after a long break and bought PoF. I'm from SEA and i have no idea which server should i be playing on. I'm currently in JQ which from what i've seen, is kinda inactive for WvW in my timezone. Which server is the best for SEA/OCX timezone? is EU better? Looking at the wvwstats website, EU seems to be the better choice for the timezone but are there really more SEA/OCX people playing there or does it mostly consist of europeans?

Wouldn't have to wait if pres were being done.

It's without a doubt a recorder - flutes don't have a window or a ramp. They've (obviously) taken liberty with the dagger pointy end and the extra long head joint, but it's still definitely a recorder haha

Well he was asking how you level in HoT what, considering you only can access these maps at max. level by normal means, sounds like he used the insta level item without knowing the core game. Also because this is usually how MMO's work. New expansion, new level cap.
---
He only mentioned in his comments down here, that he already played PoF and thus he should be aware of that fact.

Thank you!
---
&gt; all the combo stuff was one of the hyping/selling points back when the game was about to come out but
---
Yeah, that's the important part: *"but"*. Due to lack of any kind of constraints on the system it immediately devolved into abuse. Instead of fixing it (with no clear cut solution in sight to this day) they chose to more or less phase the system into obscurity.   
---
It would help if there wasn't such a jarring gap in power level of different effects to start with, but at this point anet aren't willing to expend any effort on fixing the system. Stay tuned to CU for its next iteration.
---
as if anyone should listen to someone who unironically takes MBTI tests seriously
---
this is a crazy idea that would ruin everything, however i'd like if they made just the weapons available to core specs too
---
&gt;Plenty of people think their "alternative playstyles" and being "hardcore casual" is some kind of excuse for playing 10k hours and still not being able to make a functional build or press buttons that actually work. Frankly I assume these players have significant learning disabilities.
---
frankly I think you have anger management issues which you refuse to sort out and you're probably the typical neckbeard to boot since you rage just as much as one
---
also you have no excuse to call other people trash just to hide your own inability to play decently
---
Because i upvoted them when they were downvoted ;)
---
Were they ever important?
---
It was still kinda useful when I did map completion on thief but there are for sure things that need to be improved..
---
nice message of the day 
---
I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I exploded.
---
There are a lot good loking skins ingame, you can build your style eventually and will have stats.  
---
Of course oufits are like cool at first sight (mostly) but you can have a pretty good look with stuff droped / crafted
---
Firebrand (elite specialization requiring POF DLC) is a niche healer. I believe ranger has some AOE healing abilities later on in elite specializations as well. I’m not well aware of many base classes focusing on healing other players since a lot of the PVE content is soloable and most base classes have a self-heal while you’re still low enough level to be on the core tyria maps.
---
Elite specs have healers but none of them are really a hard “healer main” healer, they have their usefulness but none are really *The* Healer, afaik. 
---
Wish that were my only problem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSytEbFlN9c

Time for OP to change flair to "Charr main".

---
Ah, fair enough, forgot about that path.
---
So because I struggle with number 5 I should give up trying to raid instead of practicing? 
---
Your heal skill is number 5. Everybody gets one so we don't have dedicated healers outside of organised group content. Some elite specialisations are better at healing than others, such as druid, but there is no 'healer class'.
---
in PUG fractals, It is the best dps.
---
in Raid one of the top dps.

This build is borderline OP with group with bad Quickness and Alacrity uptime.

Its lack of a subscription fee is nice.

I can't number. I have the dumb.

I wish we'd instead get rid of most of these multipliers: the difference in output between a player that is under all these buffs and a player that isn't is simply too massive. Either get rid of that power or shift it to the skills themselves.

As others have said, there aren't any classes which are made for healing support only. The most important thing is, that every class is self-sufficient, meaning that with their healing skill they can refill their own HP and sometimes others' too, depending on the healing skill used. Every class has access to around 5-6 kinds of healing skills. Some affect other players too.
---
If you do want to heal others, you can surely build a character around that goal. Some classes are obviously better suited to be healers. The best option would be Ranger's Elite Spec called Druid. Other classes' specs allow for healing too. Namely the Necromancer's Scourge, the Guardian's Firebrand to name a few. But also Revenants, Elementalists can heal others. If you are really looking to become a healer at max level, don't pick Warrior or Thief, as they are not suited for that. Also, even if you are looking to heal others, while levelling, you still should go for equipments which enhance your damage. When you reach Lvl. 80 then you can look for armor that compliments stats used for Healing.
---
Play around with different classes, see which feels best for you. And there is definitely use for a good healer in most groups. The most professional players, who can avoid all damage will not take a healer in their teams but for all other cases, you will be welcome. Healers not only heal usually, but also give positive buffs (called Boons) to players that make them stronger. There is a lot of ways to be a healer, but they don't come at Lvl. 1. 
---
Have fun!

Too much Elonian wine to go with his existential crisis and depression

Coming from WoW, I appreciated many original gameplay features, most of which are thought-out very well and fit the MMORPG incredibly. They include:
---
* Weapons = subclasses, basically; they play out quite differently, and easily interchangable out of combat
---
* Crafting mats of all levels stay relevant in endgame - just mostly, but still beautifully done
---
* FFYL (fight for your life) system - being "knocked down" and having additional unique skills while being so is very cool
---
* "Scaling" system for downscaling high-level players in low-lvl zones is as good as it can get in any game, in my opinion
---
* "Sufficient open world" - zones are instanced, but they are pretty big, so the world still feels quite open, AND there is always sufficient amount of people around you, because it's easy for server to control instance population. It's a huge problem in modern WoW, in my opinion
---
&gt;majority of raiders are these "super toxic elitist" which really isnt the case
---
&gt;Have fun, learn to fucking dodge

They don't need an "excuse" for being bad at the game lmao. Some people don't want to get good at games. That's fine, leave them alone with what they find fun.
---
You can also dodge the teleports with distorts.  Use your shield 4 and then use any signets and F4
---
I would say the 20k mark depends a lot on when you look at the boss DPS you do. If you look at a VG log for example while you may be at 20k during the boss phases you may end up quite lower than that if you look at the overall boss DPS because you don't deal any damage to the boss itself during split phases. Same would apply to any boss that has phases that prevent you from hitting them (which is a lot of them).
---
Then of course on some bosses mechanics are 100% RNG and if you are veeery unlucky (looking at you Matthias) you can end up not being able to correctly hit the boss for quite some time without being able to do much :p
---
Thank you! I sometimes look at drawings I made 7 years ago just to fill myself with a bit of hope that you do actually improve the more you practice :3 
---
soo.. you wanna be carried through all wings?
---
Damage is already respectable but its potential is even higher when you can get high Slow uptime on the boss. So you need an actual boon chrono or some other class.
---
I mean they should know to shut up after seeing you top the damage board since Power Chrono's damage is insane.
---
Gw1 had more accurate life steal. 
---
As much as I applaud you for putting effort into training people, I'm not sure if druid staff camping gameplay is the best gameplay to be showing prospective fractal players.
---
It's two completely different games if you have no idea what I'm talking about lol.

I've just finished the main personal story and have just completed "Torn from the Sky" in HOT. I've started to explore Verdant Brink and the Silverwastes, and I honestly feel a little overwhelmed. There are always so may meta events going on and there are new icons that I dont really know what I should be doing now. 
---
Is there any general explanation anywhere on how to go about tackling HOT, like which items to save and collect, or just how to start the area? Everything I've seen so far are in depth guides for specific events that I don't really understand or haven't done yet.
---
They literally agreed with you on the content though...
---
Just a protip: Those artists draw those things in lower detail because they have the knowledge on what amount of detail is necessary to tell the brain what it's looking at, things don't need to be hyper-realistic to convey the information. Aka if you wanna learn that you should learn how to paint in general. You have to first know the rules to bend them. Your missing a lot of knowledge on the drawing fundamentals (anatomy, form, light and shadow etc.) so my suggestion is learning the fundamentals in order to make your drawings more appealing and allowing you more freedom to draw what and how you want. The difference between an artist who knows their fundies and one who doesn't is astronomical. You will improve MUCH faster and your work will be way better
---
Have you tried it with two of them?

"We're not THAT DIE, we're the GOOD one! I swear!!one!"
---
&gt; I would predict a lot of reddit posts like: If you're not committed 100% to GW2 I will just leave and maybe check out your new game in 3 years. Bye, Felicia! 
---
But the current situation does the same thing. We get one big patch every 2 to 3 months with 2h of story content. You can maybe get 1 week of fun out of the new map until you unlocked all achievements and thats it. Waiting for 3 months to repeat.
---
I don't play GW2 daily anymore. For me, it is really just a side game I hop in and out as I want to. But I can only imagine that people who play it daily are highly unsatisfied by now.
---
Healing output isn't very good. Heal Scourge is mostly used as a revive-bot and barrier-on-demand bot, which makes him an insanely good pick even if you don't have a dedicated healer.
---
It's funny in a sad way in WvW groups. You'll often see players that think individual actions / gameplay is irrelevant in large groups because of the amount of players.
---
But especially in most pug groups, the 20/80 rule applies. 20% of the players do 80% of the group performance. For these players, individual actions and gameplay really matters and has a big impact. 
---
80% of the players do 20% of the group performance. For these players, it's true that their actions are irrelevant. Not because of the number of players, but because they're too bad to make a difference.
---
This isn't just in terms of damage. Corrupts, healing, buff application, resses, ... 
---
The difference becomes smaller in guilds and organised / stacked groups where everyone is expected to carry their weight. But even if you make a "meta" pug groups you can expect several players with negligable value. 
---
Keep evading the question and cope harder. If you're ever against FA take your guild to south island on our raid days so I can shove some CoRs in your useless tempest's face like every other bottom feeder in this godforsaken game.
---
oh god dont remind a guardian main about that we have ptsd
---
gUYS ITS JUST MY MINOR ZEAL TRAIT IM NOT DOING IT ON PURPOSE I SWEAR
---
Camping druid staff, repeatedly failing Arkk orbs, and not using cc? Sorry, but you got carried hard.
---
You can disable that random chatter in the sound options.
---
It's funny cause you're talking about PvP.
---
The poster you're replying to has clearly been talking about WvW throughout this thread. (WvW thread, talking about ranks, referal to mithril, ...)
---
it was horrible druid showcasing and I felt bad about saying it here but thanks for giving me courage.
---
Also, at some bosses it is beneficial to talk with your group. As thief breaking rota on bosses shouldn't be a problem, since you can get back into it pretty easily, it is more important to know what makes your rota good (for example as DD: Stand behind, have less than 100% endurance, then you're set).
---
I really learned to apply golem knowledge when playing fractals, since there you have to be fairly flexible on your rota at times.
---
Cheers! I understand what you are saying - Back to Basics. Sure, it comes off a bit harsh but I was the one asking for feedback :3 
---
It's because you misgendered him.
---
&gt; Training people in fracs
---
- Plays druid and camps staff

- Doesn't CC

- Improper timing on glyphs

- Doesn't use elite spirit for stability when it's needed

???
---
Cheers! Means a lot to hear that :3 
---
Wow, reading comprehension is not my strong suit this morning. Still, it's not like I've not seen the same comparison made in this sub before.
---
Lol DIE isn't Wavy, KEK, VR, or Rise. I'm not worried at all xd.
---
Well said.
---
This looks rather off.  
---
Specially the hands. Charr claws grow straight from the tips of the fingers, not covering the  upper side of the finger like human nails.
---
This may be a human in disguise.
---
We've been there is Arena Net as well before the HoT release. Then only half of the promised stuff was ready and the other half was not as fleshed out as we were let to believe. I think Mo even released a statement that they won't announce big things anymore before they are not 100% sure that they will make it into the game. Thus resulting in the PoF reveal event 1 months before it was released. While it was not the best expansion an MMO has ever seen, they delivered on what was promised. The same with LW episodes. While it may not be much for most of us, the general structure of every new release delivers stayed the same since LW3. We get new story and a new map. With some fractals and raids sprinkled into it. (not nearly often enough, but it happens)
---
The problem with Arena Net promises is, that they are poorly communicated. Like when Mo made an statement that they could release 6 new raid wings every year, but don't do it because the "quality" would suffer. What kind of info is that supposed to be? "Yeah we could release more content but we don't because of reasons" is not exactly the best marketing idea. And after this statement also backfired, the big silence we know today began.
---
Yeah, i feel like new instabilities are well thought out and fun. Birbs need some fine tuning but everything else is fine honestly. Raid wings are also fun. If they touch up some of the older bosses then it would be perfect. Or if the add minor instabilities in raids. OH YEAH YEAH!
---
The Female Norn’s moan when she takes a falling damage 
---
A full clear is obviously never going to happen. With the right mindset and more strict rules clearing a wing within 2-3 hours is very doable. Even more so if you have 1-3 experienced players to take up the "carry roles" (aka chronotank).
---
You'd be suprised howmuch easier training raids get if you get strict requirements. Just insist that players actually meet certain golem benchmarks (for boons or for dps) before they can join the training. Then players have actually practised their DPS rotation for a while, at their own pace, and suddenly half the W1-W4 bosses are quite easy. 
---
It also lets the entire group focus on boss mechanics more than "gorseval killed all of us because half of you do sub 10k dps, lets try again and please magically do more damage this time".
---
Definetly a meme. 
---
not really considering i can do it on an alt with full exotics, i personally know people that just started and can do at least 15 with bare min effort, also i said around 20k so thats really anywhere from 17-23k
---
You might wanna consider a written guide instead then.
---
This so much. I only raid these days and that gets pretty repetitive after a while. A good group of friends goes a very long way :D
---
Super cute. I'd love to have any of my asura drawn in this style
---
That would be a bad idea, since people may make mistakes and buy too much of something, so they may want to sell it back.
---
And flipping isn't really bad except for a few items as it keeps the value of items high and stable.
---
What would work to avoid having people buying items only to sell them is giving accounts a 'trade volume quota'.
---
This would be a variable amount of items that can be bought within a certain time based on 3 values: 
---
 * The stock of the item. The lower the stock, the lower the initial trade quota accounts get for that item.
---
 * How often the item is being bought and sold by the account. The more frequent transactions, the slower trade volume quotas take to refresh. 
---
 * The difference in value between purchases and sales. The higher the difference, the more quota gets used up per item. 
---
This would only kick in under a certain stock. For example, if an item has 9999 stock or more, there would not be quotas for it. 
---
And the calculation of the quota would have to be adjusted to affect only people who buy large amounts of a low-supply item only to sell them much higher. 
---
So someone who made a mistake and sells the items for a value just high enough to recover the original buy cost after tax would get 0 of this quota added.  
---
Another possibility could be adding a new "Account bound on [x] trade(s)" property for very rare items that are meant to be sold if not used, but not meant to be speculated with. This would only be applied to very rare items like rare drops required for collections.
---
So, for example, an item could be sellable only once or twice, and the last time it is received from the trading post after using up its trades it turn account bound.
---
You can run daggers on weapon swap if you need some more cleave. 
---
Yes. Transmutations are item-specific. This is why people mostly change skins only on max-level weapons.
---
Actual feedback / constructive improvements usually get burried, especially on reddit, when compared to the posts that blow off steam. Of course those are more popular. 
---
The amount of players that agree with "this is an issue and should be fixed in THIS particular way" is always going to be lower than the amount of players that agree with "this is an issue". One is a subgroup of the other. 
---
So obviously the sentiment dominates over actual feedback. Not to mention that the community isn't interested in debates because as soon as a post is longer than 3 sentences, they can't be bothered reading. 
---
All that said; there's plenty of merit to the feeling. MMORPG's have lost a huge market share to other types of games; imo for good reasons.
---
Fire for Effect Deadeye is still one of my favorite builds in the entire game. With Diviner's, it feels even better. Unfortunately, outside open world meta events, it's very limited since most of DE's damage comes from traits and it doesn't bring much beyond that.
---
I'm also a fan of support Scrapper. Superspeed, 50+% team damage resistance, massive condi cleanse/conversion, big heal spikes, and absolutely no damage or damage amps for the slowest clears you'll ever see.
---
I find certain charm in this non-pro style.
---
Saying "fucking" makes you toxic. Swearing is bad kids. 
---
Telling people to learn how to dodge is clear and rampant elitism. You can't tell me how to play the game! 
---
Toxic elitist confirmed.
---
I also frequently train people, teach mechanics on the fly, shotcall everything, and play all sorts of different classes while doing so. Sometimes, my rotation totally goes down the drain too when I'm doing all that. I get it!
---
But I would imagine that what people are mostly taking issue with here is that you're posting it on Reddit for educational purposes. This gives new Druid players false information on how they're supposed to play in fractals.
---
Your quickdraw management was almost non-existent, you failed many mechanics, you didn't detonate spirits before split phases, you didn't cast nature spirit when you should have, you camped one pet (and the wrong pet, at that), your glyph of empowerment timing was often off, you camped staff almost the whole way through, you failed to properly CC, you sometimes healed at nonsensical times when people were full or nearly full health... I could go on.
---
You might know all this stuff already (you're a fractal champion so I'd imagine you have enough experience to know this stuff). But a new player won't know that stuff.
---
If you want to be properly informative, then record yourself doing some proper gameplay, and then edit it and splice it up while talking over it. That means the gameplay will be properly representative of how you're supposed to play in CM fractals, AND you'd be able to explain to people how mechanics work.
---
I just tried it out. With food and the usual buffs (refer to snowcrows for the specific ones) I got to 27.38k DPS and I am by no means a very good Ele player, so I guess the benchmark would be around 30k-ish (huge Hitbox). So not a "bad build" per se, just getting outshined by almost every other Ele build out there.
---
Did you get enough attention from this, or should you post it in another subreddit?
---
Yeah it didn't seem bad at all. I needed to stock up on machetes though. Have to go back and do some of the previous HOT maps to get stuff to buy them. After that I think the only thing is going to be doing the meta to get as many amalgamated gem stones as I can until I can buy the rest.
---
THE MAD LAD FINALLY DID IT
---
what a very selfish post
---
Dude... 20k is 90th percentile on every w1 and w2 boss, impossible on xera besides p1 ofc, impossible for sama, 90th on deimos, impossible on dhuum 90th on largo's with bis class and impossible on qadim. That means new people most likely will only hit it on kc, xera p1, cairn (though new people make this a shitshow), mo, sh and ca (shitshow with new people). That means out of 16 bosses only 6 bosses hit it. Thats less than half
---
&gt; Let's look at your proposed eastern designs. One is a mini that is completely irrelevant to the game within its official capacity of what exists and what doesn't. Within the scope of the perception of the characters for the story, it's not like Rytlock or Kasmeer see little minis following the Commander around.
---
**Absolutely** irrelevant! It doesn't matter if minis are "real" ingame or not (actually they are!). What those minis do is showing that Anet bring eastern style into the game and **that's** the important part.
---
&gt;The celestial dragon is only relevant during the Lunar New Year festival, directly from the wiki, "Celestial Dragons are entryways into Divinity's Reach during the Lunar New Year festival. Players travelling via them arrive at the Crown Pavilion Waypoint." 
---
Yeah... can't you read?... GW**1**
---
[Try this one](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Celestial_Dragon)
---
But you are not trolling, nooo.... sure.
---
&gt;That's it, full stop. Really measures up to importance compared to the Elder Dragons, huh? (sarcasm, of course.) One non-existent promo item and another as a festival flavor piece.
---
Okay full stop!!!
---
Does anyone mentioned any importance? Please explain me **why** is it important to differ between mini and Elder Dragon, if you only *want to show that Anet uses eastern style in the game*?
---
To show that there are more eastern elements than Mordremoth. 
---
Right, it's absolutely not important, because it doesn't matter if it's a mini, a festival or an Elder Dragon? 
---
Oh and btw, it's not only a mini and a yearly festival, it's a **whole game** called Guild Wars: Factions. So is a whole game enough for you to compare with the endboss of one meta event in an expansion?
---
&gt;Kuunavang has wings so it doesn't lend itself to traditional eastern design for no wings and spontaneous flight. It is not a Chinese dragon. **Not a single one has wings**.
---
What a bold lie...
---
&gt;Chinese dragons are occasionally depicted with bat-like wings
---
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon
---
&gt;The Mouth of Mordremoth is really the only card you have to play for a definitive eastern dragon design of canonical importance within GW2.
---
You haven't played GW1, have you? Because you ignore everything about it and if not, you take some short information from wiki.
---
You forgot that a whole game (GW Factions) is made in eastern style. That's more than enough to prove that Anet uses eastern styles. And knowing that they use it (since Factions) is more than enough to justify an chinese styled Elder Dragon. 
---
Yes Mordremoth has a unique style and doesn't look like Kuunavang, Tequatl or the Shatterer, neither do Zhaitan or the other parts of the Elder Dragon we have seen. 
---
&gt;Starting from the beginning with our ole boy Zhaitan and his most notorious World Boss lieutenant, Tequatl. Take a look at the concept art and in game models.
---
Yeah, look at Zhaitan again, no legs, only tails. Not the typical western dragon. 
---
You should keep in mind that all Elder Dragons are unique. Sure they are inspired by similar things like eastern or western dragons, but still designed to fit in the world of Guild Wars. 
---
&gt;How's that for trolling?
---
Pretty much the biggest troll you ever made, since you literally repeated the whole original discussion without minding **any** of my arguments. So I had to repeat all my arguments -&gt; *even those I wrote just one comment earlier!*
---
Yes, you didn't stop trolling and I think you really giggling because of that. [Stop trolling.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11111/111111327/3192486-trolling-is-for-losers-stop-trolling-now.jpg)
---
/bow
---
all right thats cool dude
---
i mean if one single post is enough to make you not do end game pve content then you probably should be on the internet to be honest, doubt it would actually affect anyone to that extreme though
---
Hmm, I can't really think of any that I would expect a beginner to be able to manage that though - a quick scan of GW2raidar shows that only Cairn and Soulless Horror have maximum 50th percentile numbers (the class with the highest 50th percentile) above 20k, and on those bosses only Renegade and Mirage manage it.
---
:(
---
&gt; The Heart of Thorns maps aren't inhabited by any playable races
---
Don't mistake immortality for invulnerability.
---
Anyway, even if the commander was not alone on some decisions, who would have had the strength to make them a reality ? Killing the commander would indeed put a sharp braking to all tentatives towards dragons.
---
Someone woke up on the edgy side of the bed this morning.
---
Bitterfrost frontier is inhabited by kodan amd quaggan but it has renown hearts so I'm not sure what playable race has to do with this
---
&gt;So basically what I'm trying to say is Joko was never immortal, and Aurene will not be ressurected by his magic, because he never had such an ability, and the fragments of Staff of the Mists he somehow restored gave him a barrier, the same like to Livia. And Joko was Abaddon's lich.
---
You massively underestimate the power of the asspull that anet writers possess.
---
The thing about living world, is that it adds nothing for the average player other than another generic map.
---
I play the 2 hours of story content, and then I quit the game for 4 months until the next one come out.
---
What else am I supposed to do in lw maps? 
---
There's nothing TO do in them. I already have the ascended trinkets I want and even if I didn't a new map isn't going to suddently make me want them.
---
The problem with LW is that while pretty on the surface, it adds nothing of value or depth to the game. It's not long term content.
---
Friend of mine plays Hammer Support Guardian in fractals and I love it. No damage and very few boons just minor healing and a big hammer. 
---
“Pay attention to me, inferior species member.”
---
tl;dr
---
Anet just seem scared to make a statement of any kind off-schedule. They seem scared of creating another PR nightmare, but are slowly in the process of creating one themselves.
---
I get that there are things that you want to keep under wraps for story purposes and to create hype, but this isn't the way to do it. Silence on the future doesn't build hype, it builds anxiety. Drop a tease, a snapchat/tweet/Instagram/whatever of a photo with some cheeky "Oops, forgot there was something 'secret' in the photo we shouldn't have posted."
---
I personally know the game isn't "dead" the way other people are thinking, but the silence really makes you wonder sometimes.
---
No. Need to simplify the game to death!
---
Guild Wars 2 at release was a much superior game to today in terms of gameplay and community features (actual server communities? What a concept!). Shame what this once great game has devolved into.
---
In fact, you can get even more. For example, I get between 110 and 140 each time.
---
What??? He's helping!!!
---
&gt; If he was truly immortal, he could just throw Aurene away with one swoop and restore himself at once
---
Immortality doesn't work like that.
---
Yes, Joko is a manipulator. However, there are so many possible layers to his deception that people wonder how much truth he gave us in disguise as his usual melodrama.
---
The thing about liches in the Guild Wars universe is, as far as we've seen, they are able to use the souls/life force they collect to sustain themselves.  It's not like a typical necromancer.  Liches are always able to come back as long as they have souls/magic to feed off of.
---
In GW1, we are able to defeat Vhizier Khilbron, another lich, by "killing" him over and over again.  Each time this happens, he leaks souls.  Now, while he could normally keep reclaiming them, he is unable to because he is near mursaat soul batteries that actively absorb the souls before Khilbron can. He eventually dies for good because he simply ran out of souls.
---
In a similar fashion, Joko (clearly a more experienced lich since he's been around a lot longer than Khilbron had) has been able to build up a reputation as unkillable because he likely has a huge store of souls to draw from.  In fact, I'd be willing to believe his needing-to-pull-life-from-an-awakened-to-speed-up-his-healing was actually just for dramatic effect.  I doubt he'd ever leave the house without a few dozen extra "lives." Not to mention he now reigns over Elona, so he definitely has resources.
---
So how was he defeated? A dragon, that can consume magic attacked him.  Like the soul batteries that drained Khilbron, Aurene was able to quickly absorb his entire stash of magic, finally breaking his illusion of immortality.
---
So yeah, he probably isn't truly immortal, **however,** he was clearly ancient and managed to survive roughly 1450 years (if not longer, since he might not be human?).  Plus, we don't completely know what he knows about the Mists, nor if lich magic is something that can be transferred.
---
So sure, you can point out his lies as much as you want, but it doesn't change the fact that we don't know enough to disprove these theories.
---
One of the big issues for me (next to rewards being so heavily tied to new ascended gear types: which means if you do not need them, and as open-world PvE hero, I don't, my rewards are really just more green and blue un-ided gear) is that each expansion gives you one elite spec which comes with 6 new utility skills and a weapon and using those prevents you from using the first spec. It's 7 years on, and I am still stuck using the same old boring skills from lunch.
---
It's certainly not what I want from a GW game ...
---
&gt; If he was truely immortal, he could just throw Aurene away with one swoop and restore himself at once
---
The fact that you've decided to define "immortality" this way doesn't mean that's how it works within the Tyrian universe. The majority of the "proof" you offer is in a similar vein where you've just decided something must be so.
---
you also missed the part where i said to do mechanics and im speaking from the aspect that they would be pugging, stop acting like im asking for the impossible also i said around 20k so thats legit anywhere from 17-23 dude
---
They had a solution to this: Current Events. Intriguing world-wide events and mysteries and all kinds of cool lightweight content to keep us interested. I genuinely believe that model works.
---
But they've practically abandoned it now.  Didn't even finish the most unique ideas that they had started.  Why?  Seems like a ridiculous decision.
---
It’s pretty clear half the people responding didn’t even take the time to read what you wrote. Your feelings are valid and felt by many. I miss my old friends too. But they wanted to leave and I havnt found something new worth investing my time in, so I made new friends :)
---
Do you already have all of the hero points? If not, a great solution is to join a hero point train. That will get you access to quite a few of the mastery points as well because most hero trains also hit any mastery points they come near.
---
That hurts to listen to, I hope you have some sort of screen protector!
---
I read it in Louis CK's voice from one bit, which pretty much sounded like Borat. [Link](https://youtu.be/4h_I4AFJpwI&amp;t=2m32s) 
---
Funny that you mentioned it... I just threw away that shadow stone yesterday since I thought they'd abandon it anyways.
---
As a veteran player that played off and on again. 8500+ hours played so I guess I was on a big part of the time even do most times especially since PoF released I just chated... which kinda says a lot about the game.  
---
Pre HoT I played mostly pve daily dungeons, fractal 11-20 .... 41-50 when you could still trick the boss and a LOT of farming (remember frostgorge sound champ train, karka farm, Severed breach waypoint, or even better Shelter Peni? pepperidge farms remembers). When HoT I got even more active all I did was run hot maps for months. Got my "the golden child" done first (somewhere in the first few weeks doing 6-10 AB meta's per day) as I wanted it for all my asuras .... Even after finishing that I figured out you can relog to alts and loot the chest's so I had 8 parked there (The loots omg 30s+ per ecto) and the rest of the maps as time went on. Even do I never bothered with most of the collections as I dont really care about AP.  Fractal daily's, Weekly raids with progression runs when new wings came out.... played the episodes when they came out had a ton of fun.   
---
Now after the PoF release, its just ..... Meh
---
Finished my first run of the story (except the last episode) on the first night, After that I started playing but something felt of ... took me 1 full week to realize the maps where actually ... dead nothing really there some mobs scatered around, some small events and bounty's ... that was it every map seemed empty especially late at night. A problem that HoT didnt really have I was doing AB at 4am no problem... I mean yea you had bounty trains and hp trains ( which they made pointles) people trying to get achivments done but there wasnt anything real there not like on the HoT maps, less collections, map currency or the envelops and the other thing leg bountys where ok at first if you wanted PoF stats but after a couple of months they made them useless.....    
---
And they are continuing on this slope. They started adding some collection's but they dont offer any real gameplay most of them are just gold sinks and opportunities for the rich to get richer (\*cough\*nullification\*cough\*). We get less and less actual content with each map. The only map that I sometimes visit out of all the PoF maps, expansion and LS would be istan.... and even this one I rarely do as they nerfed it pretty bad and the map tokens on all the LS maps are useless   
---
The only interesting things they add are for gems. You rarely see any cool skins optainable in game with no mount skins optainable in game (and imo the way they launched the mounts at first was on purpose. So they can later add the 1200 gems consumable without people making a fuss.... People actually thanked them ........... like what the heck. It was planned and because they added that they forgot about the rest of the problem number off mounts and frequency...)  
---
Anyway my point is. Game isnt as fun as it used to be, yes I did play for a lot of time and that is part of the reason I feel this way but I still have a lot of things to do in game, that I would do but it is hard for me to get motivated when the game isnt as interesting as it used to be or worse as it could be.
---
I’m in a similar situation. Over the weekend I joined a hero point train and that was a lot of fun and a great way to explore even though I missed a few HPs from struggling to keep up. 
---
An additional question: story wise, should I wait to work on the storyline until I can buy LWS2 or does it matter really? Anyone have a personal preference?
---
as said  when mounts were anounced,they gona make large maps and you will not meet single person. downvoted to hell and now you have extremly large maps,with nothing but empty space and one person flying on grifon on horisont. mmorpg at its best.
---
Looking through old character screenshots I'm almost certain it's a design feature of Norn women but it could just be a result of how lighting/shading works in game.  Across multiple armor sets and weights the tops of the breasts seem to have that "bikini tan line" effect.  It's more pronounced the lower the top is cut and it shows more on darker skin tones which is why I think it's more likely some design feature to the skin itself.

around 20 dude
---
Guild Wars 1 wasn't a shooter. It was more of a strategic lobby game. No, I don't think it would have done better.  Remember, when Guild Wars 1 game out there were very very few multiplayer games to choose from. 
---
Guild Wars 1 was too complex to capture a huge percentage of the population.  It relied less on twitch mechanics and more on thought. Pretty sure most of the people who play shooters today would find it hard to play.
---
Judging by the revenue reports, it's not only a problem on my end.
---
&gt; Some people like the game as it is, with plenty of things to do. These things just do not match your vision of "long term content".
---
Objectively, what is long term about living world? Like what about it fits even the most stretched definition of "long term content"?
---
Do you ever go back to previous lw maps for a reason other than shits and giggles?
---
you cant loot the ab grand chests if you dont have meta participation...
---
yeah pretty much  this people see 20k and act like its 200k i swear and besides i said around so thats legit anywhere from 17-23k
---
Looter shooters aren't really true shooters. They have shooting mechanics, but enemies still have health bars (we're not talking about downing enemies with single headshots like in Counter-Strike or Quake) and abilities play a large role in the damage dealing too.
---
Lol, thank you 
---
The amount of stupid shit written in the post jesus... abaddons servant? Right, go read a gw1 summary first...
---
This isn't unique to Guild Wars 2 at all, sounds like any guild in any MMO frankly.
---
Over time people will get bored of the content no matter how good/bad or anything in between, the parts you mention about expansion hype and then enjoying that content together rings true especially for this, it's what causes the biggest in-flux in WoW for both new players and players leaving, Expansions KILL guilds but they can also birth new ones.
---
Just the natural Ebb and Flow of an MMO and it's players my friend, I'm sorry they're gone but there are others who still enjoy the content I think the best approach is to join those people that remain, until inevitably the cycle repeats. I know it sounds bleak but from what I've played of MMO's it seems to always happen like that, hell with any sort of repeatable kind of game in all honesty.
---
I'll admit that GW2 feels slightly at odds with the MMO aspect at times, well when they're not making cool map meta's and such but it's kept me going for 6 years precisely because I don't entirely have to rely on a large group of others to enjoy the game, it's a double edged sword really, because a lot of the content they put time into is easily arguable as single player stuff while five man content is updated fairly well with Fractals, Raids take quite a bit longer and that's got people interested in that chomping at the bits constantly for new content and let's not get started on WvW/PvP which I kind of enjoy but it's obvious to everyone that they are not a large focus, if ANet had the time and money however I do believe these modes would have teams the size of those for Living World, but alas, that is entirely unreasonable with their size and how they currently develop content.
---
All I can say is, if  there is a certain aspect of the game you want to play, you can play it and there are definitely people to play it with even if you don't know them yet, so that is some very small solace I guess.
---
It's magic! Maybe they would just have steamy/boiling effects like the elementalists' underwater fire skills.
---
&gt; Take Draconis Mons for example, I don't even remember returning to it after I finished my story and I thought that was one of the better maps. The recent map, with a phenomenal music track by the way, is also an example of this to me. Then you have mediocre maps like Bloodstone Fen. I'll probably be downvoted for this but I don't believe that every episode has to have a map
---
Agreed. I think the issue with some maps is that the map currency isn't "guaranteed" to drop from their respective nodes, and I only stick to maps where I am assured to get the map currency (like Bitterfrost Frontier and Siren's Landing). I frequent(ed) Thunderhead Peaks when I was invested in crafting for an item I wanted (plenty of Iron and Platinum Ore to be gained there), but the repeatable "treasure hunt" took over an hour to even start (need both halves of the plate to start that event) so I did it maybe twice, got meh rewards, and was done with putting that much effort in for such an event. Dailies are also pretty bad imo.
---
 &gt; Events seem to be less and less fun, but maybe that's just me. Though I love the way they made the events in HoT, especially in Verdant Brink.
---
This. Like I was just saying, in order to engage with the treasure hunt event, I need to hang around and do two metas first. So to do an "always-active" event, I have to wait for metas that exist an hour apart. I work all day, 10+ hours every single day. I only have a couple hours per night where I can comfortably game. Sure I can accumulate the half-plates over two days, but then it feels like I'm achieving nothing every other night in my playtime, and honestly the rewards don't feel worth it for two nights of playtime. Meanwhile I hit Bitterfrost almost every day for Winterberry harvesting, because it just feels worthwhile even if I'm not currently hunting for a new Ascended item or whatever. The Dailies there take ~10 minutes at absolute most, and the rewards are worth the small time investment in doing the quick events there (a couple Yellow/Rare tier items for ~10 minutes of playtime is pretty worthwhile imo).
---
I was starting to do Istan runs about a week before the announcement to chest changes was released. That killed Istan runs for me as I never seem to be on when these groups are running the meta there.
---
And then seasonal events seem meh since Halloween. I spent all my free hours engaging in the myriad Halloween activities; meanwhile Wintersday and Lunar New Year (and their location in Divinity's Reach) rapidly lost appeal, especially Lunar New Year. Sure, the Red Envelopes are "worth it" for getting money and luck, but I was extremely bored waiting for races, or doing the Firecracker lighting for the 10th time. Dragon Ball offered an okay change of pace, but the mode was super buggy and once one team managed to gain momentum, it always turned into a steamroll.
---
You've got nothing to answer my challenge with, and I've refuted your claim completely, so you resort to "look at how big my dick is."
---
I'm glad not every Linux user is as completely insufferable as you.
---
&gt; and they just give every important boon with no interaction whatsoever with combo fields
---
And that right there is my biggest gripe with the powercreep. Too many boons, too easily spammed, and too much uptime. 
---
I miss the time that ~50% Protection uptime on old cele ele was considered proper gameplay. Now, everyone and their mother has Stab and/or Resistance out the wazoo.
---
&gt; Judging by the revenue reports, it's not only a problem on my end.
---
It's the same problem for every MMORPG, they're always perpetually falling down, and bounce back at every expansion/breaking change.
---
&gt; Objectively, what is long term about living world? Like what about it fits even the most stretched definition of "long term content"?
---
If you want my objectivity, I don't think this term can apply to any game at all, neither solo nor MMORPG. You'll always get fed up or be left with things you don't want to do (ex: not interested in PvP).
---
There is so much you can do, and once it's done, where's the shame in taking a break ?
---
&gt; Do you ever go back to previous lw maps for a reason other than shits and giggles? What is the "plenty of things to do" in them that I'm missing?
---
Well, I did Aurora for instance. But that's indeed an exception.
---
Anyway, I fail to grasp how people didn't realize earlier that the end game of GW2 was ... cosmetics and completion. It always was. There is absolutely nothing new in it. We have new shinies, new gameplay (glider, mounts) from times to times, but at the end, it's either convenience/cosmetics, or gear grinding.
---
And if that doesn't appeal to you, if you're not a completionist, maybe the game is not wrong, you're just in the wrong game.
---
Yeah, I will finish this long before any of the other things.
---
You can, I leech tarir daily
---
I am not getting bored at the game at all. I just don't see how using all that dev power for LW is worth it (negatively affecting other game modes) for maps that you complete once, you do the achievements, a few collections and then you are done. Do we really need 1 map per episode? Does the game really need that much dev time for this one map per episode design? WvW still hasn't a third borderlands. How many new PvE open world maps have we seen since the last WvW map release? I think the focus on that design hurt the game overall. Will the game become better, without the 1 map/episode design? Imagine what all that huge dev power could do.
---
Good question. I took a long break, returned, just picked up Ydalir, and was feeling the boredom set in. I wanted to avoid getting so uninterested that I would leave altogether. Managing content is one way to do that. I also have friends that play that i don't want to let down.
---
Is he actually trying to teach? or is he advertising for raid sellers? I'm confused
---
Which is funny considering they have exercised and demonstrated a split in balance between modes in at least a small part to avoid the argument that PvE kills PvP or vice versa, yet they don't use this split often enough and, well, here we are.
---
I enjoy PvP simply for the combat system, that's true. But the balance is less than favorable. But I think I would agree with you.
---
This is so true. And I find that on average gw2 players are more cooperatively minded than some other MMOs.
---
Should be one out with the next Living story, which we should get within the next two months. :) 
---
Yes. The post was about me getting frustrated with great MMOs that are so close to being perfect for me but just aren't. It was a rant, which I acknowledged.
---
I'm actually confused. Were you saying you miss the GW1 Heal Area or was GW2 overpowered but enjoyable? Do I just suck at reading?
---
I love this game, I have 3500 hours, 11 characters and 6 legendaries. But I find myself playing less and less now, and like your friends, I also feel I'm about to quit at any time. To me, here's what's wrong with the game right now:
---
- Waiting 3-4 months for a LW episode that is in the same region we've been for the past one and a half years, just to finish it in 2h and see the map get abandoned by players in a week;
---
- Good items only ever come to the gemstore nowadays, with rare exceptions like Requiem armor that honest feel too little too late;
---
- This is something that has always existed but feels more apparent now that other areas seem to be struggling: loot satisfaction on this game feels very poor. There's nothing good for you to drop or for you to lust after. Apart from the exceedingly rare drops that most people will never see, all you can drop in this game is vendor junk and mats;
---
- WvW (the game mode I most play) feels more abandoned than ever. The matchups are a joke, my server is on T4 with the same link for the past 10 months and week after week we are farmed by severs with 4.0 KDR while we sit at 0.4. I very much doubt any effort is still put into WvW server balance;
---
Most players I know that have played for similar amounts of time feel similarly, like either there's nothing else to do in the game anymore or just that it has been mostly abandoned.
---
I left for almost a year. When I returned, the group that I introduced gw2 to was now instructing me on what to do.
---
&gt; It's the same problem for every MMORPG, they're always perpetually falling down, and bounce back at every expansion/breaking change.
---
That's the thing. Gw2 didn't. 
---
HoT made less money than gw2 launch did and PoF made less money than HoT did.
---
They didn't bounce back, they're on a downwards trajectuory.
---
&gt;If you want my objectivity, I don't think this term can apply to any game at all, neither solo nor MMORPG. You'll always get fed up or be left with things you don't want to do (ex: not interested in PvP).
---
Can you stop beating around the bush and just anwser the question? What long term content do lw episodes add? They add a 2 hour story, and what else?
---
&gt;Anyway, I fail to grasp how people didn't realize earlier that the end game of GW2 was ... cosmetics and completion. It always was. There is absolutely nothing new in it. We have new shinies, new gameplay (glider, mounts) from times to times, but at the end, it's either convenience/cosmetics, or gear grinding.
---
Cool, how does living world affect either cosmetics or completion? Because you have a new map to 100% in about 2 hours? Yeah that's hardly completion. It also adds store cosmetics... except buying shit from the store isn't exactly "gameplay".
---
In 5 episodes we got 1 new mount. Gliders were part of the expansion, NOT the living world...so...?
---
&gt;And if that doesn't appeal to you, if you're not a completionist, maybe the game is not wrong, you're just in the wrong game.
---
I feel the need to ask, why are you deflecting so hard? It seems with every question you beat around the bush and avoid giving a clear anwser.
---
and what else do you want? Give us example how they could improve living world maps. You cant because there is nothing more they can do. We have metas, even good ones but peolpe dont play them because someone said on reddit they are bad just like PoF metas, and they are not, and PoF metas asctually give lots of money but people with HoT nostalgia glasses cant understeend it. We have collections, lots of skins (whole armor and weapon sets for god sake) What else you LW haters want? All I see is whining, tell us what is wrong then. I just think people like you get bored of the game and is looking for a reason other then themselfs and you pick living world maps. Like other guy said there is planty of things to do on them. If you burn through them too fast maybe play less? There wasnt and will not be any mmo which will get content fast enough for hardcore players to always have something new to do, its just impossible. LW maps are not a problem, they are full of content. Stop with the hate on them as we may loose them that way (happened with WvW content people hated on new map and now we get nothing) LW is the last bit of content we are getting in this dying game so stop the hate or we will get nothing.
---
Good answer, thanks.
---
Thanks! Yeah, the bottom one is the older one. My dislike for it is specifically the contrast being too dark, palette falls apart around the darks as well, and issues with over-detailing. 
---
With the new piece, it's a "less is more" approach in terms of contrast and detail. 
---
I think a big part of the game is really giving yourself goals. Once you finish the story, there is so much else to do but nothing makes you do it. The game offers stuff to do, but you need to be the one to set the goal. I like this kind of thing a lot, but sometimes it can be work. Recently I have been working on getting a legendary. There is no reason for me to have it, other than it looks damn cool and the journey has been good. 
---
After that, unless its new map/story time, then it will be back to finding a new goal for myself. Which speaking of that, let me throw this off topic idea out. Wouldn't it be interesting to have some living story episodes that didn't give a new map and instead took place in areas we have already been to?
---
At this point if they arent building Guild Wars 3 i dont know what they are doing.
---
Judging by the revenue reports Aion and GW2 will soon be doing comparable numbers. I wouldn't say that is healthy.
---
It's definitely a flaw in the game models. Just pointing out that it shouldn't be carried over to paintings of the characters.
---
im telling people of all skill levels that there is a community willing to take them
---
I guess my reasoning for a bad build is that it sacrifices too much opportunity cost for the sake of fun lol. It was indeed a very fun and strong build back from the HoT days, but IMO what makes it have a place currently in a bad build thread is that it giving up the insane 16 seconds of burst that regular scepter tempest gives while also not giving the amazing DPS numbers of weaver. 
---
Correct. Maps are ok, but the emphasis needs to be on meta-events and associated rewards.
---
Last "current events" did shipped at december, it is called Roller Beetle races. 
---
Previously, they shipped whole updated Festival of Four Winds, with a lot of new stuff. 
---
They are still there and doing stuff. Even in same cadence as previously, maybe even more than before. So the real question is, what are they working on since december? Can it arrive sometimes soon? Or will it arrive at the start of april? *speculations intensifies*
---
&gt;Mate, you're thick-headed. Wasn't it clear from the beginning ? There is no long term content, none. It doesn't exist, it's a fallacy, an utopy, whatever illusory name you want to give it.
---
No?
---
PvP is long term content, raids are long term content, fractals are long term content, WvW is long term content.
---
Just because you're too stupid to figure it out doesen't mean it doesen't exist.
---
&gt;You want long term content ? Go elsewhere. Elsewhere where you'll find there is no "true endgame" either, and you'll move again after a couple of hundreds/thousands hours.
---
I swear to god, assblasted fanboys telling people to leave the game always perplex me. It's like, you base your entire identity around a product... and you tell people to leave so the product will die sooner?
---
Eh, it's not like they're the brightest bunch anyway.
---
is this meta-trolling
---
Thanks! People do come with me for commissions every now and then.

Up until this single quarter, Guild Wars 2 was most likely exceeding expections. It's just now fallen down to where it was a while after HoT launched, but it maintained the higher numbers longer. In other words, we had quarters less than this quarter years ago and the game is still here.  Judging any game by a single quarter's results, particularly without taking in the WON exchange rate differences, shows a lack of insight into how those details work. 
---
In other words last quarter was fine. This quarter is lower than last quarter but it's not the lowest quarter the game has had, and it's gone up since those low quarters. 
---
The game will probably lull until a big release of some kind, which is what MMOs do.  I'm not sure what the basis of your theory is, but I'm not seeing it.
---
my friend you clearly dont know how anet works. Having less LW maps wont change the thing in WvW. They work in teams and WvW have 2 devs working on it. If LW team work less it wont help these 2 guys in anyway. And the reason we are not getting more WvW maps is reddit haters on desert map btw. If we not start the hate on LW maps we will get nothing. And I think there is no problem with new map that will take a month of my playtime even if I never go back to it again. Its like a good episode of the tv show. I watch it once and never watch it again so what? It was still a good episode I will remember, same with LW maps. Anet dont even want us to replay this map over and over they want and expect us to move to the new one. Thats the point. If you dont like this system its ok, its fair. But let me ask you, is there even an other way to do it? How would they expend the world and still keep us on the same maps? Maybe you want all maps to have big metas like HoT maps? But wait... they have! Istan have a great meta that people farmed more then some maps in HoT. Sandswept Isles have 2 metas, the Inquest one give loots of loot trust me. Third map was a mistake yes. But Jahai have a world boss with three mini metas you can do that lead to it with lots of chemp bags in them, lots of other events to farm, even interesting bounties. And the new map have 2 metas with interesting mechanic of exploring catacombs when you do both of them. Its fun! So where is the problem? I belive maps are as good as they can be my friend, we have metas, bosses, lots of skins (3 armor sets and 4 weapons sets) collections, achievements, story. Dead God what else you people want? 
---
A lot are yeah. some arent.
---
An instab that makes you change the way you play or die is harder (not "more annoying" in my book).
---
I think slippery slope is bad, and birds are in the fencd (everyone but me hates them).
---
The rest? Not so much. I think they are better and more fun than they used to. And some people can't do them, i like that too.
---
I have enough slots to have one of each profession and then one extra. So ten right? I have some parked at JP's and flax locations. I'll have to check into the orbs though. 
---
Ya'll are making it seem like I really might not be that far off!
---
Not really. We were wiping at the last 10-1% and it was mostly due to SS.
---
1 heals was enough (i was healing). DPS was low though.
---
&gt;And the reason we are not getting more WvW maps is reddit haters on desert map btw.
---
Yeah nothing to do with the fact that desert maps made half the WvW population ragequit. WvW players hate on the desert map because it's worse than both other maps without updates. 
---
Besides there's a lot of things they should do for WvW, making another map isn't one of them; Too much effort, too little to gain.
---
I don't know if those are in the spirit of Current Events proper, but I believe you're right that it's the same team. So maybe I'm being a bit harsh.
---
The last *Current Events* that was actually labeled as such was the whole voting for a favorite pet, which lead to the Basenji dog whistle on the gem store.
---
Before that, it was Awakened Invasions.
---
Meanwhile, we are so close to the Mists in current stories, but we haven't finished the rift stabilizer story. So now that all the festivals have been updated (except SAB, rip), maybe we can finally get back to engaging subplots running alongside the story.
---
This so much!
---
All the other skills that used to work like engi ft2 have already been reworked (guardian staff2; even all the underwater skills). Its just the ol engi kit that still works like 2012.
---
Gw2 stopped being hype when colin left
---
If you haven't done the Silverwastes at all, start there. It's more intense than most other core maps, but not as punishing as HoT maps. Otherwise, Verdant Brink has different events during day and night (in-game day/night). During the day, most events are part of a chain. Do an event, then hang around a bit; another one will probably start up soon. The same is true for the Silverwastes. I have put a brief description of the Silverwastes and Verdant Brink metas at the end of my comment.
---
Regarding items, type "/wiki [item]" to search an item or object on the wiki. You can either type out the name, or shift+click the item to insert a chat link.
---
Some general HoT tips: 
---
- turn on "show all enemy names." Know/learn what you're up against.
---
- If you see a HP (hero point) train in lfg, hop on. Getting hero points is way easier with a group.
---
- you will die a lot. You will get lost. It's ok. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Don't be afraid to adapt your traits/skills.
---
Silverwastes meta events: there are 4 pact forts around the map. Escorting a dolyak to one will upgrade its supplies. Doing events around them will help with fortifications. If a fort is attacked by mordrem, they will overtake it if the defense event fails.
---
The Verdant Brink meta events: you have 5 outposts around the map. Doing events around an outpost makes the outpost stronger. During the night, mordrem attack rally points (this is one of the new map markers you may be seeing) near each outpost. After a certain amount of time, pact choppers arrive at certain rally points, but only if they are held by the pact. Taking a chopper to the canopy will a take you to a boss fight, and each outpost has a different boss. There are also events on the ground to retake fallen rally points.
---
I have already reported this as a bug, I have it too so it's Anet. When you see the black and white checkerboard thing it means the texture didnt load. Which is odd because Zoijas armor loads corectly when not inside of the cinematic. I have only ever seen this cinematic texture bug with zoija so far
---
"Say hi, Rytlock!"
---
*Grrr* "Hi"
---
Those reasons are all pretty valid.
---
When I was exploring Thunderhead Peaks, I saw complaints from people in map chat asking if the map was bugged and nothing hostile was spawning. Barely any dynamic events and huge sections of the map locked as story-only. It's very empty and boring. Predictable and formulaic too with the usual list of new stuff but never anything like guild halls (PoF only had 1 with it come on now), guild missions, world bosses (Shatterer again?...), or any new and creative map meta designs like the Silverwastes. Same renown heart events, same escort events between them, same limited map currency, nothing cares that you're there. The story is better at least, but they should've made GW2 instanced like GW1 if they wanted the story to carry GW2. The world doesn't feel threatening or that it cares and just happens whether you're there or not.
---
Higher magic find I guess 
---
Yes, it's like 2 hours
---
Btw you never use fire signet on power builds, it's there for passive crit chance. Active is only strong for condi/hybrid builds.
---
Definitely important to balance the details! I'm a big fan of lots of detail myself, but I'm not good at rendering it. Also even with a lot of detail you'd want to keep it to the necessary details and not to details for the sake of details. There's merit to both simple and intricate though, and again the balance is the key. 
---
Minus 1 day ago
---
Asura and Taimi need to be toned down massively.
---
They effectively know everything and can do anything at a moments notice.
---
There’s no point in any of the others even existing because the ‘smartest’ Asura can do everything.
---
I feel like the way the story has become intresting is a bit hollow. 
---
Every episode and expansion they constantly raise the stakes again and again and again, at release it was "civilization will fall" and now it's "Kralkatorik will eat the entirety of time, space and the multiverse itself".
---
The issue with the looming threat of a constantly impending apocalypse is that you eventually have to actually follow up on it.
---
How much bigger can the threat get than kralkatorik eating the multiverse?
---
BDO is really nice and relaxing if played casually in PvE mode, not caring about having the best gear in game and ignoring P2W and PvP elements.
---
Guild Wars 2 is always my #1 choice, but sometimes it gets boring.
---
The gift of exploration is from map completion of all zones in central tyria, not completing individual zones. The zone reward is given in a chest that appears above your minimap.

Maybe I am misunderstanding, but it sounds like you may have got 4 gifts of exploration without actually completing the map, so you should be able to complete the map to get more. However, if I were you, I would avoid contacting support to get gifts of exploration again, because it might start to look like you're exploiting them for free stuff. Instead, be more specific about your problem if you're still not getting individual map rewards. Note that cities like Lion's Arch give reduced completion rewards.
---
You must be on NSP/SF. I know your pain.
---
Same, saw this during dialogue while running Ruined City of Arah.
---
Except then they die because they don't know how hands work or don't have enough healing because they're in berzerker gear, and then you're in the same spot but down a dps. 
---
oh they CAN but they wont. Do LW devs can make more guild content? YES but they wont. Anet work is teams . If the team is making LW they wont do any WvW even if they have free time and skills. I still to this day cry because they deleted a guild team, it was our only chance for new guild content (this is mmo..). So yeah.. WvW team have 2 people and its all you get. Also wonder why we are getting less raids? Raid team was marged with fractal team. So they can work on raids 100% of their time anymore.
---
The thing that's really missing for me is repeatability of the maps, particularly in the form of large group metas. My favorite era of GW2 is when we had things like the Marionette or the Battle of LA. I understand that we've got rose colored glasses for S1 but all the same. When you've run through the map once there doesn't seem to be a reason to return.
---
You can use stealth to snack the hero point. The fire beneath the platform of the HP is fake.
---
Solo kill is probably possible but might be extremely difficult to pull off.
---
And you didn't specify that mechanics should be taken into account, in fact the way you phrased it "If you can do this and mechanics" implies that this would be the DPS to aim for *while* doing mechanics. Also if you say around 20k I'm going to take that as 19-21k personally.
---
The point is that 20k is a useless mark to aim for without context, and beginners aren't going to know the context. 
---
You can stealth in there and to it (assuming someone didn’t already make him rain fire on it).
---
Another option is to forgo it and just do it last via Notorized Scroll of Maguuma Heroics (I think that’s the name) from WvW which will then give you it without communing with it.
---
You know I've been enjoying fractals since they added them 3-4 years ago. Nowadays instead of being more fun they become more annoying. 
---
I'm pretty sure no. It's very much a group based HP boss, which is normally done around the AB meta either pre or post meta.
---
There was also a time where mmo (particulary wow) and rts are very popular.
---
Terrormancer necro builds used it as well. People considered those players the lowest of the low, but it was just too effective.
---
Mesmers back then were all about the shatter burst, and while cc is an intergral part of that, they didn't need to spec into lockdown all too much.
---
Druid (ranger) is your best bet for things like fractals and raids. For open world, firebrand (guardian), herald (revenant), or tempest (elementalist) are good options.
---
When's the last time the norn did anything?
---
Anywhere?
---
Like, in the entire 6 year gw2 run?
---
Shadow Catemoth
---
Try and ask in mapchat after the meta event if people can help you out.
---
[December 11th](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/62731/game-update-notes-december-11-2018).
---
The newest map was the first map I didn't 100% the day/week of release. I haven't played since completing the episode's story. There's nothing to do. Achievements? What's the point? AP rewards suck anyways. 
---
ANet hasn't added any meaningful content to the game since Wing 4. W5 and W6 were so lackluster, the maps in the Living Story are getting more and more boring. Meanwhile, ANet is pumping out Black Lion items like it's the only team they have working on the game. I'd buy some of these items if I had ANY reason to log into the game at all. I didn't even play Wintersday or Lunar New Year because the festivals are solely based on recycled content (aside from the snowman raid which I did do once because there was no reason to do it any more than that). 
---
I've been a huge GW fan since Factions release, but I'm having less and less faith in this company as Guild Wars 2 pans out. The raid release "schedule", the festival recycling, the massive push for gem store items, lackluster living story episodes and maps.. It sucks, but it's the way ANet is taking this game and we really can't do anything about it.
---
Thanks for the quick response! We are using atm and its working wonders! It has a minor bugs thou, how can we submit our crash reports?
---
&gt; i can't talk mechanics while doing it myself
---
Honestly, why not? I know some ppl are really bad at focusing at two things but these mechanics should be pretty "reflexive" at this point after repeating them for so long.
---
"Neither he or the Commander have such an ability, it's the Dragons that throw the reality into chaos, the Commander at least tries to prevent it"  
---
Did he? The dragons are driven by natural/primordial forces, the world is in constant cycle of destruction and rebuiliding thanks to their dragonrises, different races and civilizations rise and fall over time, but the world itself move forward, now here are we, suddenly decided to fuckup the natural order bringing the world to the edge of actual destruction just because dragons where doing what they're doing before and we're preventing chaos?
---
&gt; "Every LW episode is the same"
---
This is **BY FAR** the biggest hype killer for me. It's why I stopped playing. It's **utterly** generic. The episodes have become so samey that I cannot even remember characters, story elements, aspects of the zone, **nothing**.
---
I mean, even of the most recent episode, thinking about it, I had to strain a bit now to remember **any** part other than the very final thing. It's that utterly soulless that it escapes my mind the moment I'm done and the zone just turns into a boring slog of a grind.
---
That was a bit uncalled for.
---
Again, the point was that those maps (HoT) were warzones. Points are constantly falling into contest, and there are very few locations where one could just AFK and be safe, zones are in a constant state of flux, and having a heart zone indicates that it is actually safe enough to do so, which no part of any of the HoT zones has. It helped create a sense of danger and apprehension and was PERFECT for the feel of the expansion. It was a design decision that allowed them to create the perfect feel for such an expansion. 
---
Fractal Spoon will comment soon.
---
Alright, let's try and unpack here.
---
&gt; Yeah, for sure... He called us nemesis, and then he calls us impotent, where is logic? He was playing a dirty game.
---
That is correct and all but outright stated.
---
&gt; He should have told it to the Pale Tree, she gave us hope to kill Zhaitan, because it was right.
---
Joko isn't all-knowing. How much of the Pact knows of the vision the Pale Tree gave us, let alone a dictator on the other half of Tyria.
---
&gt; could actually see the changes in balance, and could step in, but no - he just wanted to stay in his Elona and improve his acting skills.
---
He was busy ruling an entire kingdom. He had cut contact with the rest of Tyria. He is not the hero type to help us, he is a narcissistic tyrant. Also, I don't understand the numerous jabs to the fact he was acting. He's theatrical. That's it.
---
&gt; Because noone ever said them they are being manipulated?
---
Yep, and he was trying to actively hurt the Commander there if only just for fun. That was literally what he was doing. Manipulating people. Propaganda. I don't see how this is an argument against Joko somehow. In fact, sofar none of the comments are.
---
&gt; Neither he or the Commander have such an ability,
---
Figure of speech.
---
&gt; It's been like the whole Pact.
---
Spearheaded by us. And we did the killing blows.
---
&gt; And we were never stupid, just misled.
---
No shit.
---
&gt; You must kill the whole Pact and the Gods before. 
---
Again, we were pretty important in the whole Dragon-slaying business.
---
&gt; If he was truely immortal, he could just throw Aurene away with one swoop
---
Not how immortality works.
---
&gt; I speculate that he could restore some part of the Staff of the Mists, that gave him an ability to control the Awakened and to force the spirits from the Mists to be under Joko's command.
---
Proof? Argument?
---
&gt; And he was Abaddon's servant all along. 
---
What?
---
&gt; Dragons can actually consume only Dragons' and Gods' magic, not the magic of mortals 
---
That is quite literally not how magic in Tyria works.
---
&gt; I think Joko as Livia used the magic of the twin weapon of the Scepter of Orr: The Staff of the Mists, and when Joko throw away his staff during the cinematic, he lost the barrier and could be killed
---
Again: proof or any argument?
---
&gt; Aurene in shadows steped in when she noticed that and used it to our advantage so I think we are alive just because of how Joko was reckless. Also what is interesting about Aurene appearing out of the shadows can be explained by that Caithe raised her, right? And also when you look back at the first chapter of A Crack in the Ice, you can see Aurene stealthy, and I'd say she must have learned those tricks when Caithe was carrying the Egg. And those shadowy, stealthy tricks must have improved when Caithe was guarding over her in Tarir. 
---
Sounds nice but I doubt it. Also, the egg bit makes no sense.
---
Probably not, but it's still true.
---
That's about how I feel. 100% of a story and map every 90 days isn't as satisfying for me as getting 25% of it per week over 4 weeks and then only waiting 60 days.
---
Inevitably, this is more complicated and would just delay the release and not solve anything... but if they could take pieces of this idea and make use of them, it could help.
---
He’s talking about **looter shooters.**. Meaning the MMO-lite genre, which is a category GW1 fits into quite accurately. 
---
Always go for the gemstones first but that's just my opinion.
---
There are recipes to craft the gemstones, you can also buy them from the TP, but if you want to do the meta in order to get them then here you go; Meta Amal-stone Train.
---
Verdant Brink - Leave your character at the top where the Wyvern spawns. The event happens every 2 odd hours. I usually go after reset. 00:00 - 00:10. It spawns in at 00:10. (It should take the people there about 2 to 3 minutes to kill). Then go to Tangled Depths.
---
Tangled Depths - Be sure to go there as soon as you finish VB, 00:12 - 00:30. It starts at 00:30. (the meta last around 12 to 20 minutes. Plus an extra 5 minutes for the wall to open at the end (if you want the chests there) The go to Auric Basin
---
Auric Basin - Be sure to come here as soon as you're done with TD, 00:45 - 00:50.  It starts at the next hour 00:00. it should take about 10 to 15 minutes to complete and get the Grand chests at the end. You have about 15-20 minutes to get to Dragon Stand so take your time.
---
Dragon Stand - Come here after AB, 00:10 - 00:30. It starts at 00:30. The meta is the longest which lasts about 1 hour and 10 to 30 minutes depending on how quickly can kill the dragon. Get the pods at the end for your crystal ores - remember to also kill Treasure Mushroom for an extremely low chance to try and get the Invisible slippers worth up to 3k in gold. Even if you do get it good luck having someone buy it.
---
It should take about 2 months and about 10 to 15 days to get your 250 Amal-stones if you're only doing it this way. And don't worry about the spirit shards, you'll be getting a ton of exp while doing the metas, so you'll have more than enough.
---
Remember to reset your character back on top where the Wyvern spawns in Verdant Brink for the next day.
---
civilization challenges your mind and you get a sense of satisfaction once you succeed. a movie entertains you for a couple of hours and can lead you on a rollercoaster of emotions, going on a hike exercises you and you can sightsee and experience nature. the game has many different aspects, some people play for pvp / wvw / pve / story / raids / map metas etc. so if someone who plays for the raids does not get any content when a LS episode is released, it doesn't mean they dont enjoy the game, it just means they don't want to play the story. some people want loot, some people want lore, both are disappointed and satisfied with GW2 at times. personally, i love the story in most games but i just do not enjoy the GW2 story, as much as i try. I like most of the other aspects of the game, combat, customisation, scenery (in some places..) but a few story episodes that i don't like every 3 + months is not going to keep me invested in this game. right now i'm just waiting until the new ESO expac releases, then i will probably take my annual 9 month break from this game until something is interesting enough to bring me back.
---
Because the key to playing an MMO is motivation. Motivation is created by having a goal to strive for. There are barely any goals in GW2 that feel gratifying. No motivation = no commitment. No commitment = no community. It's pretty simple, really.
---
Nothing unusual, for every post like this ~50 people quit in private
---
I mean the odds of it being soon are pretty good, and we know we're getting a patch tomorrow. It's not a wild guess.
---
it was the same in eotm, there was a community there and me and my friend used to just do it for the hell of it, make a new character just to go back there and level it. there were funny conversations, cool people and good commanders (sometimes). they just destroyed that for no reason, its only purpose was leveling and they may has well have removed the entire eotm from the game now because no one plays it anymore.
---
actually when i say around 20 im talking about anywhere from 17-23
---
I said it back in season 2, we should have 1 map **per season**. A really big map, size of a PoF one, we either slowly uncover Dry Top style, or morph, LS1 style. Mix those two.
---
At the end of a **season**, we'd be left with one really rich in content map which also, importantly, **acknowledges that time has passed and story has happened**. The map itself shows what happened during the story, though overall changes, while people replaying the story get zoned into older versions of it.
---
if theres no new expac on the horizon then it's just maintenance mode until the mmo eventually dies.
---
the champ isn't part of the HP
---
An example of how to properly build hype is DE with Warframe. They have regular long developer streams showing off and teasing coming content and talking about their plans and answering questions from chat. Beyond that even, their people are constantly teasing stuff on twitter. 
---
&gt; what more you people want?
---
Maps not feeling like the general lasts-for-3months-throwaway they are.
---
They are also *really* powerful when playing two-player co-op.  Having access to lifesteal/poison/stealth/etc on classes that normally lack them is a game-changer.
---
The reality is, is that even if a balance patch hits tomorrow, or next week as I suspect (due to the snow and power outages that anet had last week), it will 100% not fix any of the real issues in any gamemode. 
---
&gt; you clearly dont know how anet works
---
And neither do you, as is quite evident by your post tbh.
---
it makes me sad that you're probably right
---
Until you have accumulated so many transmutation charges that you couldn’t possibly use them all in a conservative way.
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
how is warframe like monster hunter???
---
Doh your correct, thank you.
---
Deus ex machina
---
it's great
---
Well, sure, if your legendary is gen 1, as you can just buy it from the TP, but it might just be
---
That maybe just maybe
---
They're making a legendary for themselves and not for the benefit of others?
---
It all comes down to personal appeal. I still love and play the game for massive guild interaction, occasional frac runs with the mates, and getting better at the classes/roles I'm weak at playing. The story and writing are decent but not the main appeal of the game for me. And hey man, if I ever feel that things are stagnant, I just take a break then come back after a few weeks sometimes. It's an MMO for sure, and meant to always have something to do, but it's a game like any other. Too much of anything can be detrimental to having fun at times. If I only log on to do dailies, so be it. If I log on and end up having an 8 hour session cause I'm just having a blasty-blast going from one thing to the next, all the better. Everything is in the moment for me, and what I'm having fun doing.
---
What was the issue with retaliation
---
Incorporate this into monthlies.
---
After struggling for years I found a guild to call home.
---
The people were funny, helpful, chill and so on.  I started to really enjoy the social aspect of the game.
---
But after a month or two, the leader said the guild would become WvW focused and those that could not be at the training sessions would get kicked. I got kicked. End of story.
---
On the topic, what I always did to improve the return value of the game was to build another alt, go hunt some achievements, etc..
---
But after thousands of hours I've got the point where I barely find any reason to even login and collect the daily chest. It's that bad.
---
Well they talked about "being one of the cool people"
---
Sounds an awful lot like they are doing it to look a certain way to others, which is misguided because no one actually thinks you're cool for having a legendary. 
---
Or maybe I'm reading into it wrong
---
Four months*
---
There i fixed that for you. 
---
I use them in open world. When I'm on my DH in zergs I always run Hallowed Ground. Not for stab or retal but Fire Field. 10 seconds. I cast when the boss still has Invul. but since it's the first field when the Invul drops all Might and Burning explodes out from the +50 ppl.
---
They're not, but the incentive makes a big difference in player counts for open world content.
---
Ex. I really am not a fan of Dragon's Stand. It was worth a few runs, but I didn't have a huge drive to repeat it over and over for weeks. However, I also ran Chrono in instanced content for a long time. So Leadership runes. People who *do* enjoy DS get players to fill the meta who are there for rewards.
---
Compare this to the Vabbi meta Serpent's Ire. That meta is actually kinda interesting to me because the coordination required is fairly unique among metas, but it's virtually impossible to pick up a group for it because you get almost nothing from it, so you don't get the gear grinders like HoT. It doesn't matter if you like the Vabbi meta or not, you aren't going to get a clear since nobody else plays it.
---
Why would I bother with very low yield content I want to play when it's this hard to organize if I could just play rewarding content I enjoy just as much or more, like SW or Fractals?
---
Can you explain the abuse?  I started this game about a year ago and well, quickly realized the PvP had huge flaws despite massive potential.  
---
I've been wondering why combo fields got neglected.  
---
just because you chose something at random doesnt give you a pass at not even looking at the thing, like youre using this to make a point but you couldnt spend 5 seconds like i did to even think about what you were even looking at
---
one of the old fractal instabilities was "enemies steal boons when they hit you" so if you had Retal then enemies would steal it and your team would wipe just hitting the bosses.
---
really puts birds in context doesn't it?
---
those floating balls must be toys!
---
Is that the wyrven that is on the bit plateau where you need to glide around and drop eggs on em? Or the smaller dragon on the metal thing? I know, I have a way with words.
---
I am gonna farm some of the other maps, buy 1,000,000 machetes. 
---
That's basically what I did... twice.  The guild I've been with for the past \~3 years is the reason I kept coming back from my small breaks, and now I'm fully in love with the game again.  I understand why people have left, but even with over 5k hours I feel like there's so much left for me to finish or achieve, but I think part of that is that I enjoy almost everything on some level.  I really enjoy LW stories, I poke at achievements, I run WvW with my guild (now I roam sometimes, as well), I still love dungeons, I run fractals, mess around with alts, grind for gold, and sometimes I like to get my yearly dose of salt by spending some time in PvP.  There's a massive amount of stuff to do, but if not all of it appeals to you then it's quite easy to feel like there's nothing there.  I think the only thing I don't really get into is raids, and that's mostly because if I have uninterrupted time that I can be in voice comms I'd rather spend it elsewhere.  
---
Shut up. Just shut up.
---
The quarterly cadence that never existed?
---
Thanks! :) We're recruiting. Although, unfortunately, we don't have any room for no name tempests on BG/ET who make fools of themselves on reddit.
---
"Right now, it really doesn't feel like Anet really loves their game, just that it's their job to work on it."  
---
Ouch.  You hit the nail on the head there.  It does feel like they've lost that lovin' feeling.
---
but isn't that the same reason you created this post?  ..to change people's opinion about how easy/hard it is to start raiding?
---
Look up their crafting recipes. You can typically craft them cheaper with the 10xAG for 25x3 Orb/Doubloon recipe. I’m surprised you need to grind spirit shards, as I’ve always had a surplus, despite plenty of legendary crafting. 
---
Looks like you don't have anything left, feelsbad :( 
---
You can keep saying that you want, but the only person upset here is you ;) I'm low effort goading you and you still take the bait lul.
---
The smaller one - Matriarch's Perch POI - The one where the ground is Metal.
---
And now imagine all of your friends left GW2 long ago, even long before raids were introduced... GW2 was ruined for me by losing the players around me. Sure you can -  and I did - find new people to play with but can they really replace friendships that started in GW1 and lasted nearly 10 years? 
---
My advice is to start searching for an active guild (meaning active during your play-time) that you can mesh well with.  It might take joining a few different ones to find the environment you're looking for, but I'm sure you can do it.  Twice in my time in GW2 I've been close with a small group (smaller part of a larger guild) and now none of them still play regularly.  It sucks, and while it's not exactly the same you can forge new friendships.  Keep an eye out in /map, maybe ask commanders or mentors around the maps if their guild is recruiting, or check out the subreddit for guild recruitment.  Find a new group, and keep moving.
---
Unfortunately you are not the only one. The problem is that there will always be an exploytable feature that will reward farming because that is what produces more in game time for the statistics. When you did your daily fractals thats the end od it what now? But when there is ain infinite moneymaking method that js always an otion to play
---
Ah, I see. I thought maybe the source was changed to be SFW because the pic itself is not NSFW and someone mentioned cat tits. Thanks!
---
Yea for me, the maps don't entice me at all. There's a noticeable difference between newer maps and older ones; older maps had way more content, events, unique locations etc... Whereas newer ones are kinda... Just there.
---
I literally have no reason to return to Kourna, Istan and now Thunderhead peaks (maybe to craft the new weapon types but even then, they're not really upgrades :/)
---
I was done with the new map in a couple hours because it presented literally all of the same activities and ideas from previous maps. It doesn't really have any major events that you need to participate in (all of the rewards are meh) and the map is so empty and only has a couple points of interest.
---
We need a refreshing take on the world with the enxt season, we need a callback to the base game with new world bosses that actually matter for veteran players, we need exciting maps to explore with activities, events, secrets etc... 
---
I stopped playing after HoT came out. You can see their lack of insight into what gamers wants from the game, it's quite obvious that they're unable to deliver an experience that holds value to the players. 
---
Rewards is a huge issue for me, I don't feel good when I get a new skin or some wvw rank that does nothing, or a pvp Rank that does very little. 
---
Skins as rewards is just the wrong way to go for a modern MMO, it might've worked for gw1, but there you had other goals to work towards, different builds to try and to work on unlocking skills. GW2 lacks any of this.
---
For PoF, I played the beta and I was sure, that they just added another zone, like many before. Mounts are great, but they don't make a whole expansion worth it. 
---
I didn't feel like I was back in gw1, back in the desert, seeing places I was long ago, and the impact my actions had on the world back then, no sense of nostalgia at all. And that's good and bad at the same time. You want the player to feel something new, but also tickle the nostalgia a little bit. 
---
But whatever, I'm also just ranting, I haven't played gw2 seriously for over 2 years now, and I don't even know why, the game is very good, but it just gets boring very fast. 
---
Also.. leveling a new character and having no nodes unlocked and the whole map hidden by the fog of war is just nonsense, it ruins the experience for me, there's no value of unlocking them once on a character, just to have it still locked on your other characters, just saying, this really ruined it for me, and I didn't want to come back to play, just because of that. 
---
I don't understand why do we have to have another season of LW after this one... after waiting another 2 years for the next expansion it better be fucking worth it
---
Dream on, the cost of making an MMO &gt; projected revenue, by a long shit.
---
I'd love it but don't expect it.
---
That's why I said "run around". Just run.
---
It's the same for me. I left and km waiting for sokmething really new and exciting. Just logging to unlock episodes. The nail in the coffin was the announcement of two living seasons in a row. Some people defend them by saying it's not different from an actual xpac, but it really is. I'm no more motivated to play the game, and the fact that 90% of the stuff in game is gem store related make it even worse. I'm the person number 1000000000 saying it for the 1000000000 time, but gw2 is wasted potential. I really want to play it, but anet keeps cockblocking me with their bullcrap. Only reason why the game is not dead yet is because all others mmorpgs are equally bad 
---
Excellent Ideas
---
* **Daily Nodes** - I think it'd be reaally cool if there'd be a 50% bonus at extra gatherings for the specific map
---
* **Daily Raids** - This should be changed to _**Weekly**_ but with a slightly bigger reward - it is not as punishing to those that can't run raids daily, and at the same time, more rewarding if you can run it that week
---
* **WE NEED MONTHLIES BACK.**
---
I'm all for this, but with rewards more significant than 30s worth of random mats (I know you said it was a placeholder, but I also know that's on par with what Anet would usually give).
---
I dont understand why you do this to yourself and work hard on something no relevant person will read.
---
Ya... thinking about making the bow, didn't like the fractal.
---
Everything else can be considered 'Living Story Content' from the last patch. I quite liked it personally, and I'm working my way through all the weapon collections because they are really nice looking. This thread addresses that many people could benefit from a variety of release methods or a change of pace from the current structure of living story. Change my mind.
---
but GW1 is neither of those things ...
---
I love how in the first game you could be a pure archery (or even melee) oriented Ranger w/o having a pet with you.
---
Fractals and efficient raids give optimal money. The only way to make more money is Istan, tp manipulation, and infinite upgrade extractor. So I don’t think it’s that they don’t reward enough its that the rewards are boring and suck.
---
Damn, I got to do Escape from Lion's Arch but I joined when the Tower of Nightmares fell
---
it’s a mmo, the game will never be rewarding if all you do is farm for gold. You should make your adventure, make friends. Don’t let greed control the game - just play to have fun!
---
&gt;The fact that the last rise of the Elder Dragons is considered pre-history can attributed to the dragons themselves—few records exist of the last cycle of awakening (believed by the Durmand Priory to be over 11,000 years ago, to coincide with the disappearance of the giganticus lupicus), and most of what is known comes from dwarven legends and jotun stelae.
---
&gt;The Tome of the Rubicon speaks of the dwarves fighting the dragon's champions. Tyrians have since learned of other races fighting the dragons long ago—mursaat, jotun, Forgotten, and Seers. The mursaat used their own magic to flee the world of Tyria, while Kralkatorrik's champion Glint betrayed her master and hid the remaining races.[25]
---
- From the [Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elder_Dragon#History)
---
It's definitely a thing that Dwarves, Jotun, Forgotten, Mursaat, and Seers were present during the previous rising. See the [Mursaat Lore Tablets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mursaat_Lore_Tablet). 
---
How mobile you are. It just feels nice to run around the maps or ride on your mount.
---
Combat is actually fun. You rarely just stand around spamming numberkeys. 
---
That i don't have to play it just to keep up with the latest level expansion or daily grind. If i burn out, i can take some months break knowing that i won't miss out on progression.
---
No faction reputation system that you have to grind for weeks at a time.
---
But the biggest one? There is no forced competition. You don't lose xp or loot if someone else kills an enemy with you. You don't have to race towards the mining node if someone else also wants it. Working together with someone else is never punished and most of the time rewarded.
---
I forgot eotm still existed lol
---
&gt; For example fishing
---
What's the appeal for this? Honestly, people keep asking for this but why?
---
GW1 was an artfully designed and complex game created by a team. GW2 is a casino with in-game ads for itself that's managed by short-sighted opportunists who idolize cats instead of better people.
---
CaN u HeLp QuAgGaN???
---
&gt; guild halls are a bore imo, it was a complete failure unless you have a guild with hard-core gold farmers and create stuff to do inside
---
They really fucked that one up imo. 
---
Warframe and it's clan system did the exact same thing perfectly. 
---
Costs to upgrade and develop the guildhall/dojo scale with the number of players the clan/guild has.
---
The basic "ghost" clan, has costs appropriate for 10 weekend warrior style casuals or one "pro", and from that point on, as you hire more people cost for item research and room upgrades start multiplying to a 1:10 ratio like [this.](http://prntscr.com/mmuc70)
---
So, a 1-10 people clan has basic costs, while a 30 man clan has x3 the cost and a 1000 people clan has x100 the cost.
---
That way if you want your clan to just be you and your close circle of buddies you can do it without crippling yourselves.
---
Clan events are also adjusted accordingly for unified scoreboards while also having segregated ones.
---
It doesn't help that the group events aren't terribly rewarding and almost all achievements tied to them are "do once and forget forever" types of affairs.  That was poor planning.
---
One of Anet's most commonly repeated mistakes is failing to account for how content is going to age.  Especially group events over time as a map's population dwindles as that relates to loot, event difficulty and one time achievements.  You simply have to offer something worth coming back for to get people to come back, and some super-cali-fragi-ultra-rare mini doesn't cut it.  
---
Ultra rare drops like that are a nice touch, but meaningless if nobody's going to do the event because they expect it will never drop for them anyway.  
---
You have to bring people back and the only way to do that is by offering them something shiny... Either a reasonable shot at some kind of drop (Teq's ascended weapons for example) or some baseline elevated amount of loot like Istan/SW or any HoT meta.  
---
They keep on failing to do that so these vast maps that already spread people real thin just don't bring the players back.  The lack of waypoints doesn't help this either because events need to be gotten to quickly when called... The beetle isn't ideal for huge swaths of the mounted maps, and finding a high place for the griffon isn't any better, thus limiting the places Anet can drop events.  The makings of a vicious self-limiting-design cycle imo.
---
Yeah. Good luck hitting 20k as a new player trying to learn mechanics. 
---
Getting BiS ascended gear is the easy part. Hitting 80%+ on golem benchmark is also reasonable with some practice. 
---
Putting it all together while not failing mechanics, maintaining DPS, and having a patient/understanding group is where the challenge comes in. 
---
I like this a lot but have to lay down one word of caution:
---
Bots.
---
Adding significant value to things that are easily repeatable can be pretty dangerous even just by producing inflation (of gold or fine mats or whatever your reward is as long as it is tradable).
---
I agree world boss loot isn’t great, but it isn’t two blues and a green bad like JPs are.
---
But IMO JPs are on the same level *generally* as random open world events and should reward similarly.
---
As far as problem metas like Serpent’s Ire, it wouldn’t matter how much they buffed the reward for it, the difficulty is too high for unreliable success to get enough people to play it to make success become reliable.  It’s like the old version of the Chak Gerent.
---
This is  so cool! i want to  do this aswell, thanks for the inspiration! :) 
---
I find it funny, although not at all surprising, that we cheered when monthlies were banished and now the players want them back (skimming over the rest of the replies here). 
---
6.5 isn't enough? Probably be closer to 7.5 since they should have been doing that before the game launched.
---
I've been stockpiling legendary crafting materials since W5 came out "just in case"- the hype was real. But with each LS that came out without a peep and with no release with W6, I've stopped holding my breath. Hopefully with W7, which will release... eventually....? Any sort of information at all would be great.
---
just wait until you discover static discharge...
---
In the same (sort of) vein, I loved the AMAs ANet did after the release of a LS episode. Wish they kept up with them. 
---
His roleplaying game is on point.
---
I have 9000 hours. I have not touched the game in 6 months, except to quickly play the story releases, which I find more boring the more I play them. I didn't even try the last one.
---
Use an open world build from meta battle
---
funny how you encourage people to try raiding and to ignore the "super toxic elitist" while also sounding pretty much exactly like one of those "super toxic elitist".
---
I'd be happy with build templates and an official anet dx12 wrapper like what that one guy did.
---
Other small additions that would be nice:  
---
legendary wvw ring, trinket, and amulet.
---
Rotating bonus weeks:  +100% wvw xp, +100% to reward track, +100% magic find, +100% to node harvesting, +100% wvw guild mission rewards.
---
Full pip rewards in EoTM when 4 maps are queued.
---
I'd agree that the pace wasn't good for drytop, but I think the idea has potential.
---
When PoF released with massive maps, I was hoping that the living story would be desolation sized, with living story map size chunks introduced every 3-4 months just like drytop. The story would have built on itself and we'd push further and further towards a confrontation with Joko.
---
My best idea to pull this off was a meta that failed because awakened or Joko himself overwhelmed us and pushed us back, then with each release we make headway and progress the meta a little further.
---
It would have been a nightmare to balance rewards to keep people interested but had it been tied into some of the weapon sets we've gotten in Istan or Thunderhead Peaks, it might have been cool.
---
If Anet set terrible, false deadlines and don't take in community feedback, that is anet's fault and not the community's.
---
The problem is that splits are still limited to number differences and sometimes the mechanics are just not suitable for one mode or another.
---
Nothing wrong with this?
---
Besides for the nail thing, I'd say that this is pretty good.
---
GW2 taught me that i like to grind for stats not looks.  
---
Looks are important but stats are the fun part.
---
I grinded heavy for all ascended gear and really enjoyed it crafting one by one.  
---
I wanna be able to two shot that low level boss, or tank 100 risens and laugh at their weakness.
---
Its an MMO i wanna feel power and powerful against AI enemies. The way gw2 is made is to standart everything to keep it challenging and thats important, a game to easy goes away fast but it lacks power too.
---
They do that in LW stories but its a script made up so you can kills gods.   
---
Not real power 
---
For me what's killing the game is the class balances for months. Now I got a lot of alts but I prefer some professions to others. Every time something gets axed I feel like a chunk of my desire to log in dies.I don't even remember when was the last time I raided with my main cause it's been out of meta so long..
---
I sometimes wish GW1 would have came out on the Switch so I could casually play it rather than carrying around my laptop everywhere like I do.
---
Yeah, but the current weekly raid system is punishing to those who can't sit down for 5 hours straight, and it also leads to the raid lfg being dead outside of Monday and maybe the weekends.
---
Maybe the rewards could just be reworked so that they don't take away anything from the people that storm through it on a Monday.
---
Sorry, I didn't mean to come off as negative. It's just that the quality of writing has improved dramatically in recent seasons when compared to Season 1.
---
Yep. Which makes it that much more of a shame that anet completely abandoned those aspects of the game. 
---
It’s debatable. I personally really liked her as a villain. Way more than for example Joko. But hey, preferences.
---
The Ancient Karka attack was my favorite slideshow ever! Truly a good time, even though horribly optimized.
---
I've been playing it daily since day1, my hours are in the thousands.
---
The thing that I'm guessing you're complaining about is the swipe mechanic. I don't care about that swipe mechanic and it could easily be replaced with just a clickable arrow that would work just as well.
---
Other than that, I don't see why this would be such an issue. The GW2 interface has received a few UI updates and they have been fine.
---
I was enjoying BDO until one day I got drunk and tried upgrading my tet weapon to Pen. I woke up broke and a few months of grinding had dissapeared. I uninstalled the game and never played it again.
---
If I ever went back I would only get new gear from buy orders and just save for it. THe way to upgrade gear is just too frustrating.
---
I only revisit old zones whenever i need map completion in order to craft a legendary and make a pretty penny.  I do this every 2-5 months with 2 or 3 characters.
---
Heal scourge :)
---
Returning player - I used to grind ishtan (or the ol leather farm lake doric...silverwastes before that, daily teq....dungeons before that...) I can no longer stand it though. I hate, hate hate zerg and most group content. Sadly I also hate most of the solo ways of grinding gold such as gathering mats. Is there anything else or am I just done with the game? Any mobs or events I can solo grind that would actually make gold? I have thousands of hours so I am aware of the basics like daily ofc. Thanks for reading.
---
If it was updated I'd be all over it.
---
I'm a big fan of Diablo 3's seasons and bounty system and wished GW2 had something like it. I play more D3 these days because of it, and only touch gw2 when new content comes out (even though its the superior game). This kind of thing would be awesome but with more long term goal, like people have suggested, bringing back monthly achievements.
---
You could make it so that if you've done all raids on a Monday, the raid resets if it becomes daily. for example, you clear all wings on day 1. Hall of chains becomes the daily raid for day 2, you can now repeat hall of chains and gain all the rewards you normally would have + the daily rewards.
---
It’s okay, my only real performance taste of Scarlet is in LS2 when you encounter her holo diary in Dry Top. I enjoyed the brief transition from Ceara to Scarlet in her logs. 
---
Actually, There is population problem as well.
---
For example, ocx/sea time in NA us terrible. We have no people to do anything. When compared to the least poplated time in EU, the most populated time in NA has less people than it. Then the least populated time in NA is... You can guess.
---
So, dungeon, fracs, raids, wvw are all ruined actually.
---
Oh, well, you might think I overstated this, but I believe you can't deny I am half right somehow about that we have no people as you but want to deny the time is ruined.
---
I would only want to see monthlies back in the form of quarterly achievements rather than monthly. 
---
In one month not everyone has time to do varied things, so it'll be limited, and people would try to do just the fastest stuff. 
---
With 3 months, there could be achievements that require long term non-repetitive tasks, like completing every dungeon explorable path, every fractal level, defeating every world boss, fighting in 9 raids, defeating 3 raid bosses, conquering different WvW locations, winning matches in different PvP arenas, etc.  
---
That way quarterly achievements would encourage people to go different places that may be getting depopulated, instead just going to the one spot in which farming a monthly is faster and get it done in minutes.
---
The old monthlies were too simple, like "Kill 100 X", and many people would get them done right on the first day. 
---
Where are you getting the information that he was Abaddon's Servant? It has never been explicitly stated or even implied...
---
You tackle the issue of bots in other ways, you shouldn't cripple a game just because someone can write a program around it.
---
As for inflation, you could just hand over mats and no gold. Tbh, if this system actually made it's way into the game, the rewards would probably be just barely underwhelming.
---
Yes if that system includes the design of PvE enemies otherwise all the work will still amount to nothing in the end.

---
1000% this. I dont think they should give up on training guildies or friends, not everyone can play flawlessly all the time.
---
aghhh good times that
---
A yes, but didn't you know a boon share chrono increases party dps by 20%? So while you might be doing great dps, you are being very selfish and actually generating less dps than if you would swap back to your boonshare and let someone else be best dps. &lt;--- Things I've been told when I play power chrono rather than boon
---
Guild's come and go. It's sad, almost heartbreaking, but always end like that, no mather how awesome a game can be. Good guild whit true friendship only happens 1 or 2 times in your life. Like true love. Once you feel that a guild is "the one" no other can replace it. Keep the good memories and don't blame the game too much
---
My wife and I met trhough GW2 and both of us stopped playing for the reasons posted above, we even decided to pass this year's "Friend/Ship" event because well... we don't like the current management and state of the game enough to help advertise it.
---
GW2 is a big bag of untapped potential being handled in the laziest way possible.
---
"Why hasn't Anet done this yet" proceeds to thank a player for doing this.
---
WvW pov:
---
One part of me would kill for them to make combo fields relevant again (I always loved blasting fields with guard hammer back in the day) but the other part remembers the unholy lagfest that is blob 3-way smc fights where fire-and-forget skills wouldn't even go off... just imagine not even being able to lay down the combo field to begin with. Damn.
---
Sure in PvE/PvP it'd be welcome to get things rolling but WvW.. good luck even pressing a single button.
---
&gt; They started to fix the roughness of her story with LS2, but it was after she’d already died. 
---
This is what I think made Scarlet bad.  Her cheesy escapes were fine, but we had *plot* progression with no *character* progression.  The whole time she just felt like a generic bad guy who just wants to destroy the world.  She's somewhat interesting in retrospect thanks to Season 2 and HoT giving her more backstory, but she was given no depth fot the entire year she was the focus of the plot.
---
They did too good a job of making it feel like a desert.
---
I think you hit an important point. The communities in this game are not thriving like they once were. A great many are dead or on life-support, and the rest are in decline.
---
Part of that is no doubt a natural decline with time. It happens in every game.
---
Part of that is ANET neglecting those communities (intentionally or otherwise), or side-effects of changes plus the neglect harming those communities.
---
Part of that is ANET intentionally deciding to kill communities they don't like (since non-benign neglect wasn't effective enough), like say the entire dungeon community.
---
ANET's efforts really aren't creating new, healthy communities to any significant degree. They're not reviving communities that have died or that are on life-support. They're not even meaningfully stemming the decline of the currently better-off communities.

Yup, people complain a lot about the state of fractals and instabilities nowadays, and all I think of is the triple swamp days and boon thieves.
---
We still have some stuff to work out, but fractals are in a MUCH better place today.
---
(I can't speak of the fractal state before the scales rework as I hadn't gotten very far in fractals at that point)
---
give them 10 and we'll see how far along they are 
---
You have summed it up perfectly, particularly point #2. It may help their bottom line in the short term to push everyone to the gem store for new skins, but in the long run it is a game killer.
---
It's a play on the quote by Mark Twain: "The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.", which is used widely as a stereotypical saying when some does an unlikely comeback. 
---
As for the magic itself, it looks to me that he could not be killed for as long as an awakened was still around. He seemed to have a connection to all of them, even those created by other awakened, and as soon as his body was damaged enough to die, a passive spell would kick in and consume the life force from the nearest awakened to revive himself.  
---
The fact that he used a much faster version of that to restore himself faster by killing a nearby awakened makes me suspect that even more. 
---
So all he had to do was leaving a bunch of awakened around, and he would be practically immortal for as long as they lasted.  With enough of them, he could bluff his way out being killed enough times for the awakened to get wuped out, as people would eventually give up on killing him after enough times if they do not know the secret. 
---
Back when Turai Ossa defeated him, many his awakened were in the Sulfurous Wastes, and nobody was able to get there unless they could ride Junundu, so they were safely out of the way, keeping themselves from being wiped out by the sunspears, and keeping Palawa Alive and forcing the Sunspears to trap him in a magically sealed prison since they ended up thinking they could not kill him. 
---
Another suspicious point comes from the [Elite Scourge NPC](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Akesi_Xuni). She tells us that Palawa is the original Scourge, and he taught his magic magic to others, but then they finally udnerstood his powers and how he wanted to use it, they escaped and changed how they used Scourge magic from enslaving and using life force directly to support and creating sand shades.   
---
One would assume she means that he had planned to spread his reign and create more awakened even faster, but it could also be that they realized that the more awakened are around, the harder to kill Palawa would become and that everyone awakened would become linked to him.
---
And is we believe the message he left to his loyalists, his magic had become 'unbound'. 
---
That could mean that when Aurene ate him, the spell linking him to all awakened was unbound from him. Breaking the link frees all awakened and keeps their lifeforce from reviving him again.  
---
Getting digested probably didn't help either. 
---
Now the question is: Did the magic get bound to aurene instead, or just unraveled and consumed by aurene and turned into just more raw dragon magic?
---
That is missing the point. My small guild of friends have had our guild at lv67 for a long time. We **could** max it out. There isn't anything that is stopping us except for the that fact that is it completely pointless to do so. Alternatively if you ignore the guild upgrades and just go with decorations at some point the number of decorations per area limit will give you the middle finger too.
---
Honestly, minor events in the world should still reward more than they do. I'm not saying they should give rewards on par with big metas, but it shouldn't be a complete waste of time to stop and help out in dynamic events. Jumping puzzles would probably be on a similar reward tier.
---
How do you find fractals? They're normally moderately profitable and your group size is capped at 5.
---
You could park an alt at several different jumping puzzles and open the end chests daily. 
---
Speaking of being done with the game... What else do you enjoy? Grinding gold isn't all there is to do by a long way. What are you grinding the gold *for*? People here might be able to speed things up or give you alternatives. 
---
You can be 100% correct, but if you have a bad attitude, then it will result in failure. Presentation needs improvement. 
---
I'll have to second this. You have reason to do core tyria maps all the time, map completion, collections, current events, rb races, world bosses, etc. the list goes on.
---
This post is a nice UI mockup and an explanation of the current daily system where all those like the Event Completer already exist. Prime example of reddit crowd disconnection to ingame.
---
Yes, but part of the reason that Weekly works is because not everyone has the time to deal with even a single raid every single day. 5 hours on Monday works a lot better for a lot of people, because they can set aside a night for raiding (honestly this is how it's always been when I've been in raid guilds in any MMO in the past, from Everquest on -- your guild has scheduled raid nights, so everyone knows when they need to attend and can set aside that time and/or everyone know early if they have a conflict and won't be there). Many people only play on certain days, and people who are heavily into raiding have probably made one of those days raid reset day.
---
I see what you're saying, just don't forget that "people who can't sit down for 5 hours straight" isn't the only group of people who need to be accomodated... and many raiders aren't among that group, anyway. I personally would rather do 5 hours in one night so that I can spend every other day doing other things, rather than throwing away an hour or more every single day trying to complete a Daily. 
---
I'm not sure it would have a positive effect on the raid community in general, either, considering that we'd now be adding a tighter time constraint. If we think PUGs are toxic now, just wait til they're even more frantic than usual to get the kill and get it fast, because many of them may not get another shot at completing the daily before reset if this group fails. 
---
Overall I really love your ideas, though! I think the raid thing is the only thing that I'm not 100% on board with, and I'm sure it can be tweaked into something that works for as many people as possible!
---
Aw yis, nothing more rewarding than a kill x number of y quest, my favorite 
---
RP and Fashion Wars.
---
&gt; I can't remember the last time I've been in frostgorge sound, metrica province or mount maelstrom.
---
Claw of Jormag, Fire Elemental, and Mega Destroyer respectively.  People show up, burn down boss, get loot, and head to the next map.
---
The Ley-Line Anomoly is more the type of world event I think you're after.  People show up, coordinate in Map Chat checking various areas along the route to find the boss, get everyone together when the boss is found, completely ignore the boss mechanics and people trying to explain them in chat, lose the event horribly, and fill Map Chat with salt.
---
They are clearly working on their next game with just a small crew to finish up GW2. They can't announce anything until that game is probably a year out as the second they announce they will lose gem store purchases.
---
That situation was a fucking debacle in which MO caved almost immediately to gamers, one of the most notoriously shitty groups on the internet. I get that he's in charge of a game studio, but it was still a pathetic display. The same reddit that circlejerks constantly about not taking work calls when you're not on the clock (a notion with which I agree) got furious at a woman for not having her work face on around the clock, on her personal Twitter account.
---
And then, because firing a woman for standing up for herself in a sexist situation would look fucking terrible, he went ahead and fired a man for defending a woman standing up for herself in a sexist situation to try to get ahead of what would obviously be (and was) a horrible press response.
---
This Twitter thread encapsulated it all better than I ever could: [https://twitter.com/beaglerush/status/1017050472681598978](https://twitter.com/beaglerush/status/1017050472681598978)
---
&gt;I would only want to see monthlies back in the form of quarterly achievements rather than monthly. 
---
When monthlies were around, most everyone that I knew had them done within the first day or two of them being refreshed.  They were typically stupidly easy to get done in a couple hours total (like 2-4 if that).  If they were to be quarterly, they would have to really ramp up the rewards and requirements to complete them.
---
Twisted Marionette was the best, whish we could do it as world boss again ... one could dream
---
Oh, PvE seasons could be something different. Maye greater, or as an additional task along quarterly achievements:
---
When you use an Expansion level 80 booster, the gear from the character is [packed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Package_of_Old_Equipment), and they get temporary gear, level and stats until they confirm the boost.
---
Something similar could be done to have a level 80 character "Rebirth" for PvE seasons.  
---
Once a character does a rebirth, they would go back to level 1 and have their old gear packed, and then the PvE season could have a series tiered tasks to perform as they level up again. 
---
Tomes of knowledge would not give them exp as they have a 'fake' level so, for rebirthed characters, tomes and writes of experience would work like for level 80 characters, and give only spirit shards. XP bonuses like from food and boosters would work as usual, tho. 
---
Rebirthed characters would keep map completion and they would not have the locked skill and trait progression, allowing them to equip all of the skillbar and 3 use the Hero Points earned from that to unlock skills early. 
---
So what would reset?
---
* Level -&gt; Back to level 1, in the starting tutorial. 
---
* Skills learned -&gt; Hero points from map completion would be refunded. 
---
* Specializations -&gt; Hero points would be refunded, and elite specializations would still require getting back to level 80 to be equipped. 
---
* Equipped gear -&gt; Packed into an item.
---
* Main story progress.  
---
What would not reset? Basically everything else that is character-based: 
---
* Map completion. 
---
* Progress from non-repeatable content. 
---
* Progress from side stories. 
---
* Crafting disciplines.
---
How would making a daily raid wing tab in this reduce the amount of time you have to play the wing? The only reason I would see that it reduces time is if the daily wing was same for everyone so most raiders are playing that wing and pugs fill faster.

When a grieving person asks themselves "why?", it's a rhetorical question. It's a natural part of the grieving process. You're not really supposed to answer, because there usually isn't a real answer. And you're definitely not supposed to *argue*.

^^^^^/s
---
For sure, and I hate to echo the doomsday viewpoint because I also love the game and don't think it's as bad as some people have been perceiving. However, with so many of these posts popping up combined with the lack of communication on Anet's end; regardless of whether it's company orders or otherwise, it's a worrying trend.
---
Realistically, rather than being pure doom and gloom, it just feels like Anet is old fashioned. A lot of their practices in PR feel antiquated, like they're not really sure how to interact over social media. It seems like they're used to the days where you exclusively use the forums to check for problems/suggestions, and release information to gaming news sites. The problem is that social media is such a *huge* part of pretty much any medium these days, whether it be film, gaming, hell even *law enforcement* use twitter to blast information and crack a joke every now and then. A lot of currently popular multiplayer games are linked because the developers of those games are becoming increasingly transparent as to their design decisions and influences; whether they're successful or not, people value that transparency. 
---
I've made a few metaphors about it already, but it seems like we're talking at Anet rather than with Anet, and that doesn't really feel good as a consumer in 2019. That would be fine 20 years ago, but not now.
---
&gt;  the best they can do now is be some combination of loud, selfish, and whiny

Except that's exactly what Norn were in Guild Wars: Eye of the North. Biggest difference was they weren't downplayed for comedic effect. They were boisterous, solitary and only cared about themselves. Anyone who would get in the way of what they want would meet the end of a weapon.

Fuck, Ogden's first description of a Norn in Eye of the North is exactly THAT!

1. Once I proposed new currency system for core tyria. Each zone like kryta, ascalon, could have it's own currencies awarded by participating in events. We could buy lots of skins, minis, maybe exchange them for materials too. Also, there could be permanent account bonus unlock system similar to fractal one. Imo it's super amazing. Bonuses are small yet prestigious. We could get bonuses to garnering in zones, karma gain, exp etc.
---
2. Bestiary. Huge encyclopedia of all enemies, divided by category. Killing enemies will award us with progressive description system and give small bonus vs enemy types. This could be rewarded purely with AP, because having descriptions of all enemies in game would be awesome.
---
This two "simple" things could spread all population among many zones.
---
You're ignoring the signet mechanic, it inflates damage a ton.
---
“What’s coming?”
---
That’s a question that there should be an answer to: Is there an expansion in the works? Any big new things that could be hinted at?
---
We know, at least, that we get a new living world episode every few months. But we only get suggestions of what we’re getting a week out, then ANet disappears for months again. It was mentioned in interviews that season 5 would be coming after season 4, but what about the main site?
---
ANet has always been tight-lipped. But after a few instances of not delivering on what they announced, it’s been taken to a new extreme. Not having regular communication with your fanbase and giving hardly any info on what there is to look forward to next is a death sentence for an mmo.
---
As an spvper the list of troll builds climbs high for me: 
---
Condi1shot trapper shortbow soul beast 
---
Full signet 1shot rifle warrior berserk amulet Core warrior 
---
Celestial minion axe torch  scourge 
---
Condi fire brand 
---
These are just some man the list is endless 
---
Poppin heads with 1shot rifle war is the most fun tho. With the signet ferocity stack. People get so confused xD 
---
I see the current state of Activision Blizzard and WoW... and I wonder where is Anet? How aren't they out there taking advantage of it? Is like they don't care, like they are just fine the way things are..  
---
Checking reddit from time to time, scrolling over Fan Art waiting for some news, relevant news... and IDK feels like this is it. Feels like anet is not capable of transmitting a drop of passion for their own project/work/game... feels like they are done with it. Like its Living Story, mounts, seasonal festivals and that's it.
---
Sorry for bad English.
---
20k DPS is just insurance against getting launched out of a pug when some joker forgets how to do mechanics or can't squeeze a buff out of their rotation for the life of them.
---
Things fail, and then everyone starts looking for things to blame, if your DPS is below that, then expect yourself to be one of them.
---
&gt;"Every LW episode is the same"
---
&gt;"It's getting predictable"
---
&gt;"PvP and WvW are being neglected, and are a mess"
---
&gt;"The maps feel empty of people, devoid of content"
---
&gt;"I don't feel any sense of reward playing the game anymore"
---
&gt;"Everything has become formulaic"
---
Well, all in all that's only 6 statements from 6 persons. Surely some others will agree with some points, but that's pretty few compared to the hundreds of thousands of players GW2 has. 
---
However, critism shouldn't be ignored ofcourse.
---
Yeah, I understand it's **really** not easy.
---
I keep thinking that a good way of handling it would be to have quite a lot fewer maps added, but make each one something inherently unique and memorable, as a combination of 4 things (not always all of them):
---
* Some unique theme.
---
* A distinct reason for this map to exist. That's something many of these tiny maps are missing. Or they're large in m², but only because everything is very dragged out, which also feels weird.
---
* A mechanic which is bound to the theme. Usually this would be part of either the meta itself (think defending/taking the forts in Silverwastes) or part of some final bossfight. But it could be anything, so long as it relates to the map directly. 
---
* Some way the map is directly relevant for more than just 2 hours. Returning to it with multiple LS-episodes is the simplest way tbh.
---
I would see the following as my "ideal" way of adding new maps:
---
1. New LS season brings in a new map in the first episode. Initially only a small part is available, or there's nothing in the vast majority, or some other way it feels distinctly "not explored"/"not settled".
---
2. Each subsequent episode expands upon this is one some way. Either we get more of the area accessible, existing area is transformed or activated, or already existing content within an existing area is permanently transformed in reaction to something which happened in the store (think the tower exploding in Kessex Hills).
---
3. This slowly "builds" a meta, a chain which gives rewards each step, until at the conclusion the final fight gives a slightly bigger reward + a daily one-off reward as usual.
---
4. Ultimately, the whole zone is active with event chains including branching ones and those going back-and-forth.
---
5. The zone is aware of the store. That is, the final state of the zone is canonically **after** the story that season told, even though at the beginnig it was **before** the story, or well, just at the start of it.
---
I'd call that a "suboptimal" build, not a "bad" build.
---
"Bad," to me, would be running stuff that doesn't really synergize at all -- like gearing for condi but using a weaponset that doesn't really stack conditions, or picking traits that enhance an ability that you're not even going to make use of, etc.
---
Man, guy actually puts together a training group for people (when nobody else is doing it on LFG and KP required is going up each week) and people giving him crap for not being the best. So what, least he is helping the game mode rather than just having exclusive groups for only those that have cleared it 50+ times before people started requiring KP. 
---
Amnesia - After one too many blows to the head, the commander has forgotten where anything is in "X" map. 
---
After accepting the choice, have the map reset from an exploration point of view. All poi / hearts / vista / hero points / waypoints and fog of war reset, completing the associated task to reopen them will give some kind of reward (not extra hero points), even the possibility of a Black Lion Key for map completion.
---
dunno,for me its rather important to see ppl in mmo,there is  100 better sp rpgs,i wana to do stuff with ppl towards something,interesting events or metas. for me best example of this is probably AB,where you NEED ppl to cooperate in smaller groups and at the end all gets nice rewards. its not dumb boss like all metas in last  3 years,where  50 ppl aa some golem with 500 000 000 hp.
---
Well I was a student back then, lots of free time x)  
---
I tried Tera and Tree of Savior for a bit but GW2 really is the best I've played.
---
It's obviously a Mighty Morphin Dragon Dagger
---
Why do Event Completer when you can just do other dailies that take less than a minute?
---
The problem with the current daily systems(!) is that most of them are useless or not worth it.
---
The Daily Completionist daily is okay but as I already said some of them are much easier or faster to complete than others (with the right setup you can do 3 in less than 5 minutes).
---
The map specific dailies (living story) are just a bonus and not worth it unless you need the map specific rewards. Since ALL of them are active EVERY day there is no incentive to visit all of them. You either do the ones that give the best rewards or you do content that actually gives decent rewards (like Istan).
---
The game really could use some better daily system that actual encourages you to visit different maps every day.
---
So the wow players (me included) that has been playing for 14(!) years now, are addicted? You could say the same thing about any hobby that one might enjoy, keyword enjoy. I know times change when one gets older, im only 25, but I cant sit on my computer all day and play video games. But again, if a game really is that enjoyable to you that it makes sit for hours playing the game (over the span of a deccade..in moderation ofc), I'd argue thats a pretty good game.
---
-30% hp+birds+bleed fire = death within 3 sec if you dont have dodge on cd. (on dps with 10k hp)  4 necro meta inc?
---
Honestly, BDO plays like an advertisement for a game that doesn't exist. The combat is fluid but actually fights are dull. The visuals are stunning but pop-in was *dire*. The character creation is amazing as long as you want a character to basically look like a LA porn star. There are lots of crafting skills but they're all puddle-deep and heavily reliant on obscene levels of grinding. The horse auto pathing uses the most jagged, unrefined paths so it's fine for a while then jolts 90°. 
---
It's a bunch of cool features that are *just* developed enough for a demo to show they exist and then they stay like that. 
---
GW2 does have some abandoned areas (guild puzzles and dungeons) but BDO felt like they developed features just enough to be able to advertise them and then moved onto the next selling point. 
---
I always thought they we need PVE reward tracks just like we have in WvW and Spvp!
---
You mean Monthlies? :) :) :)   
---
Yeah it's time to bring them back! :) :) :)

---
I love this video, how many memories =)
---
I did really like how Vindictus handled i-frames. Each class had their own usage of the invulnerability, but for the most part Vindictus encouraged players to dodge into the boss, rather than away.
---
Guild Wars still handles dodges well with endurance and methods for increasing endurance gain.
---
&gt; for a LW episode that is in the same region we've been for the past one and a half years, 
---
But I like Elona :&lt;
---
(I agree with the rest of your post though)
---
how am i doing it?
---
i'm not the one saying that people completely new to raids should do around 20k dps before even considering joining. even if we assume that 17k is the minimus toxic elitists like you are willing to tolerate without saying you should just buy your raid kills.
---
according to raidar those dps numbers you are demanding are better than 50% of recorded data for most bosses. you are literally asking people to be better than half of the population on their first try or then just not even bother trying and go to raid sellers if they want a kill.
---
you are not offering any helpful advice, not pointing people to the many recourses available for raid training. you are just saying "git gud or gtfo" in a more lengthy way and then bitching about every commenter that calls you out on it
---
Honestly the only way I do is finding a good group of people to play with.
---
&gt; Put out a new base map per quarter or so
---
Hey, that's what they're doing right now! 😛
---
But hrm... yeah, dunno. I mean I'm envisioning pretty big maps which also change quite significantly during the story progression. I loved that part of the old LSes tbh, where the world wouldn't be frozen in time but in fact keep changing as time *actually passes*.
---
In part because they attempted to nerf Signet of Inspiration which only allowed Chronos in raids to run even *less* boon duration and enabled pChrono/Mirage to carry bad boon Chronos.
---
If Anet was open about balance and communicated with their playerbase Chronomancer wouldn't be going through the hell that it has been going through for three years now.
---
Legendary Gear.
---
I LOVE how they implemented it.
---
Especially with precursor crafting. They are all different and really build a story around how you go at getting a legendary built. 
---
The stats aren't any better than ascended, so you don't have to go for them, it is entirely elective. Yet they still feel rewarding to get, with the ability to change your build at a moment's notice (out of combat) is really nice.
---
It's so fucking sad that the gap between raid releases is so large that by the time the new wing comes out with the completed legendary ring all of the raiders that want it are going to already have everything needed to make it within 30 minutes on patch day unless it requires some timegated bullshit in W7.
---
But it got appropriately nerfed at some point, meanwhile in future Tyria mirages, soulbeasts and deadeyes are still unbelievably fucking broken.
---
Their new maps are great though.
---
I think monthly GUILD achies would be good. like the pvp/wvw ones were you need x amount of guild members in a party to do y amount of metas (or world bosses or whatever). also simple tasks like gather 10k of x (should scale with guild size).
---
i wonder why you keep trying to imply that i'm not an experienced raider? i have crafted all legendary armors and deleted hundreds if not thousands of li because they just take too much bank space.
---
you are trying to say that i'm a bad raider and try to drift the topic away from the main topic because if you didn't you would have to actually counter my argument that you are the toxic elitist new raiders try to avoid, and there is no way you could disprove you are pretty much a textbook definition of a toxic elitist according to this thread and all your responses to comments on it
---
People don't change that much in just two or three generations. Maybe one person can change their ways but as a whole, a society won't. 
---
&gt; You completely ignored every other mention for The Claw, Tequatl, Aurene, Glint, Vlast, The Shatterer etc.
---
Because they are absolutely irrelevant. It absolutely doesn't matte if there are western styled dragon minions or not, it doesn't change the point that Anet **also** uses eastern dragons as inspiration. 
---
It doesn't matter if Zhaitan or Kralk or Tequatl looks like a western dragon, the point is that Mordremoth is inspired by eastern dragons and look more like them than like western dragons **and** the point that Anet used eastern style since GW Factions, which proves that they didn't start with Mordremoth. 
---
These two points are the important one and say everything. So stop your trolling and humbling grammar nazi sh*t. You got the answer to your original point, if you can't deal with it, it's your problem, not mine. Learn to deal with clear answer and logic and stop trolling.
---
&gt; 1 healer with condi cleanses. Needed for the second tower phase. Maybe firebrand? Is there a class that can remove conditions from 10 players?
---
Heal scourge is godlike for unorganized, less experienced groups here. Lots of condi cleanse (from 10 players, yes), lots of CC, can even help pulling adds with spectral grasp.
---
well,players are happy now in pve,chrono was finaly nerfed,so meta for fractals is SUPPORT GUARD,DPS GUARD,DPS GUARD AND DPS GUARD. i guess thats better.
---
Zone-specific reputation that earns you special keys, and a daily quest that gives rare materials and upgrade items in exchange for a set of various types of keys. This way, all content can be worked into a system that rewards grinding, even when the quest isn't active. Plus it will allow players to work towards long term goals by grinding specific content that will reward them with what they need.
---
Ah yes, let's turning playing a game into a full blown job to get any reward out of it
---
Tfw Fortnite does Living World better than GW2
---
I still think they should bring back vanquishing from gw1. we still have instanced maps, why not use it?
---
Absolutely. 
---
If you're playing just to get gold, what's the gold *for*? Try some collections or achievements. Get some rare gear. I'm currently doing the short collection for astral gear, based in Istan and it makes the farm squads feel worthwhile. 
---
If all your motivation is gold, then what are you playing for? What will the gold get you? Is there another way to get it that you would actually enjoy?
---
I don't have much time atm, so I didn't read everything, but don't we actually have this idea ingame -&gt; daylies?
---
If you're considering bringing staff Weavers for that though you're already thinking completely wrong.
---
There's a reason SC stacks pChronos. Not only are they really strong DPS-wise but they bring a lot of good utility. pChrono can run GS for effortless shard clear or Focus for emergency pulls in addition to having CC through Grav Well, and boon strip through Phantasmal Disenchanter. Frankly, pChrono (and just about any other power DPS) will outclass DH on Xera. If you want more CC, bring it in the form of a DPS like pHolo instead of running pBS. If you want shard clear, bring pChrono running GS and have a cBS  to focus shards while the Holos throw grenades or whatever at them when their rotation allows.
---
Mirage mirage yeet
---
Gonna second this. If you're not running 1 Chrono, 1 FB, 1 Renegade comp, Scourge is your best bet for clearing conditions. It also gives a crazy amount of wipe recovery thanks to traited Garish Pillar + Well of Blood nearly instarezzing a whole subgroup.
---
For one, that only happens when she's standing in the shard AoE and if she is standing in the shard AoE, either your tank or your shard-clearers messed up. 99.9% of the time, she is not going to be standing in shard AoE nor should she be, because...
---
Point number two, it doesn't make much difference whether you bring a condi class or not. Cripple is a condition. Chill. Vuln. DPS classes *also* inflict conditions, passively and actively, and constantly reapply them, even if the durations are shorter.
---
I'll say it again for emphasis, though: **If Xera is converting conditions to boons then someone is not doing their job properly**.
---
Thanks! I know I'm far away from a good piece, but if it as thumbnail got someone fooled then I'm on the right track ^^
---
So just to scoot in here with an opinion nobody asked for. The reason I don't like other MMOs and I do like GW2 is specifically because these types of content where repeating a certain task is involved (big bad killing # of X monster, largest bad delivering or gathering items) aren't a thing. You do have hearts, which are my least favourite thing of GW2 besides world completion. And I understand this isn't entirely the same because you're not forcing players to do this in order to get XP like a lot of other MMOs. You're simply trying to reward people for playing the different maps. But I'm strongly against the idea of adding more grind to older maps in order to give them value. Yes, this is a voluntary thing that simply means playing the map is more rewarding. I understand that. The problem is that it's a reward that will either be pointless or mandatory. It's just like the map rewards already existing, except the already existing ones allow you to do *any* event on a map and you're awarded with extra. If you add rewards that are based on doing *anything* rather than a specific thing, then you're not forcing the players hand. It's the worst feeling looking for that last kill on X monster for several minutes because you're not the only one there and while rewards for kills are shared in GW2, spawn rate is not tremendously increased and monsters are fairly quick kills on all maps in all levels, so there will be other players competing for those kills.
---
The way to bring people back to old maps is adding new content or improving on the content that exists. Such as the Current Events. There's less (or none) of that during the living season, which is a shame, but I also figure that serves to not divide the player base between new map and old map with new event. And a lot of those Current Events suffer from the same tedious and trite concept of completing *specific* things a number of times.
---
Bottom line is, although I must admit I did not read the entirety of your proposal, nor the comments, is that this is just adding (ways to) grind and I am not a fan.
---
This is entirely accurate, but it's kinda the point of GW2 isn't it?  They want to make a game that everyone can feel like they are doing well at.  You don't get rewarded in any way for actually performing better and there's not an obvious way to even tell if you are performing better.
---
I'm with you on that, enjoyed that period of GW1 way more than what we have, I'm just pointing out the common pattern
---
Well often times what I see is that people seem to imply that all the balance lies with the balance team and issues with skills and traits but IMO that is not the case. It also has a lot to do with lackluster encounter design and PvE enemy designs in general. As long as it is like that I don't think we'll see any real improvement, only shifts.
---
holo is better than dh because dh will lose the cleave when switch to scepter, but holo can remain strong cleave in 360degree 
---
this this idea that people need to be hand held through content because they cant be expected to play a tad out their comfort zone is ridiculous, explain to me why exotic gear is this unreasonable thing to have for entry lvl raiding
---
There's no reason to avoid condi classes. Xera gets boons by standing in the shards' AoE. So if she is getting boons, you either need your tank to position her better, people to clear the shards, or more/faster CC. 
---
If you use a power warrior as you suggested, they won't be able to help clear the shards unless they're standing in them (ideally you never get to this point) since they're full melee.
---
Use two druids, one with Water Spirit and one with Healing Spring. Split the other four spirits and have both bring Empowerment and Spirit of Nature.
---
A ton of DPS classes can work, as long as they have or can fit some range in their build. Power DH, rifle power holo, power deadeye or daredevil with a P/P set they can swap to for shard clear, staff weaver, condi renegade, condi SB (they can also bring Bear Stance or another Healing Spring if you're really having issues with condi cleanse), and condi scourge (they can insta Epi down a couple shards if they time it so the mobs are dead at the time).
---
If you've tried it before, it helps to know what issues you were having, as that's easier to diagnose than setting up a general comp.
---
Grocery lists are my least favorite thing about online games, especially MMOs. These ideas would be cancer for me.
---
i think that pugs get worse and worse
---
good god nobody cares about your guild
---
Damage negation, but scourge can instantly rezz multiple players with 90% health instead of 50%.
---
Oh that means my accounts 5th Birthday will be next Month! (Yes I‘m still sad I missed this by a month.)
---
You still need people to clear the shards in the first place...
---
You claim Warframe did it perfectly. Then you gave example of scaling but scaling doesn't fix the fact that its all useless and the decoration limit gets in the way even if you are doing it only for decorations.
---
Scaling would only enable everyone to reach the point where the GH is irrelevant at the same rate instead of smaller guilds taking a longer time to get there.
---
When someone says something is perfect I expect some sort of improvement over the thing that is not perfect.
---
Just one thing to note on that, about the "was only 23 years old" part, she's a Sylvari.  When she was born, she already had a good understanding of the world and its forces, and was fully equipped to learn further.  Sylvari skip the physical and mental child steps and move straight to intellectual (if not emotional) maturity.  The PC commander Sylvari is only six years old, for example.
---
Were Scarlet a human, she'd be the equivalent of 40-45 years old, in terms of how much learning she was able to acquire.
---
Water spirit is imo largely not really worth it with two healers, especially if it's a druid you'll eat into the other druid's CA gen not to mention pretty much every single heal build gives out regeneration since regeneration is like one of the most useful, important, and basic healing things a healer can have. 
---
Healing Spring would be better in a two-healer scenario. Still provides regeneration - but also condi cleanse. Take trapper's expertise with it too. 
---
I think you're overestimating the CC. It's enough to justify bringing it but a warrior's scorched earth is really nice to have because of its huge cleave.
---
A Deadeye is a safe choice that can bring CC (Basilisk Venom) and ranged DPS when needed (rifles for buttons, shards). Daredevil to a lesser extent but you have to much more careful in your positioning. 
---
A Power Holosmith is also a very safe choice with a lot of CC and cleave.
---
Go for it! What is your character? Or shall I ask for main since a lot of players, me included have like one of each xD
---
I remember vividly how many ppl threw a hissy fit every other week about how dailies and monthlies tied to a specific region or map is "not playing the way **I** want"....
---
yeah, now see how that turned out.
---
Dang this sounds fun, I would love this. 
---
so let me get this traight you chose a SC, log skim through it and cherry pick the 3 lowest dps in the squad without thinking about why that is, and someone im at fault you didnt bother to think about it. You might have as well picked a deimos log looked at the HK's dps and pointed that out too, like obviously if youre  being asigned to a mechanic that takes you across the other side of the map for the entire encounter your dps will be shit. and lastly if you can manage 20k dps while doing mechanics properly then people will take you in anypug regardless of what your kp is
---
It is a major problem that each new LW episode needs a new map to feel worthwhile, and that each map needs a large-scale map meta to feel worthwhile. The player population feels great in HoT metas and more recent living world release maps, but I agree that it's unsustainable.
---
While your proposal would likely help funnel more people into each meta, it might also result in people having less time to play each day missing the metas they might enjoy, simply because if they miss one playthrough they will need to wait several hours before the next one rolls around.
---
If meta timing is ever spaced out in the future, I hope it's on an alternating-hour rotation (e.g., THK is on at 9:45 and 11:45 today but will be on at 10:45 and 12:45 tomorrow).
---
The team could also develop more resources to reworking and improving existing maps and/or metas instead of building one from scratch. Maybe alternate between adding new zones and reworking existing zones between episodes. That way,  the devs are adding content without adding more maps to further spread the population.
---
Water spirit is extremely redundant in this scenario imo. There's no need to provide regeneration to the other subgroup from that one druid with it since the other Druid can already do it on their own between Healing Spring and Call of the Wild and it'll cut into the othr Druid's CA gen as well. 
---
Much of the value of water spirit (10 man regen) is lost in two-healer compositions imo. 
---
&gt;  Then you gave example of scaling but scaling doesn't fix the fact that its all useless and the decoration limit gets in the way even if you are doing it only for decorations.
---
Except that's the thing.
---
The use is that's a fun creative outlet that gives you bragging rights. So much so, that exceptional halls are offten showcased in the weekly dev primetime streams and make up a big chunk of the warframe's content.
---
"Use" doesen't automatically mean minmaxing.
---
My original point was that because of the other Elder Dragons it's inconsistent and I take issue with it, as well as the underwhelming boss fight that was just a fat Mordem model. It's lazy. They are relevant because if literally every other Elder is of a consistent style and then one isn't, it throws off what makes sense as established by the game previously for an Elder Dragon. I can see it making sense for the Sea Dragon when he comes out because that's an entirely different environment underwater, of course he wouldn't need wings, he swims not flies. That is logical. And it's fine if the designs were far different for Cantha, thats a whole different continent. All it boils down to is they just went a little too far left field with Mordremoth, ***only in my opinion*** since you need to be told that, when they had set this design precedent for so many more models and dragons. He's still a kickass entity, just not really a "dragon." That would be really cool if they made some connections for Mordremoth to Cantha, he would tie in very well with the rest of all that lore for his design. Yes, at the end of the day Anet and it's devs can make all the design decisions they want, no matter how inconsistent, because it's their game, but players have and do point out those inconsistencies. I have fun playing the game regardless, I just want compelling boss fights man, not what we got from Heart of Thorns.
---
* The world building, especially the original core Tyria zones, is amazing. So much to explore and discover, so many little touches that bring it alive.
---
* The story has been pretty uneven at times, but overall I've enjoyed it. My enjoyment of the game would be signicantly lessened without it.
---
* The mount system.
---
* Jumping puzzles! (Most of them, anyway.)
---
* The large array of cosmetic choices, even if some of them make me roll my eyes hard or flee in horror.
---
* The fluidity of the combat and the way dodging is incorporated.
---
* Dynamic events
---
* The cooperative play concept that underpins the whole PvE  side of the game. This one is huge for me. HUGE, I tell you!
---
b.PL: Before parking-lot. 
---
I dunno if you’ve looked at my post history, but most of the views I share on this subreddit are not popularisation, especially when it comes to my views on progression in gameplay.
---
It should also be noted that for the past year I have been actively involved with developers giving direct feedback on balance and the pvp game mode as a whole. I can say quite easily that none of the feedback that I, or others part of the initiative has really been listened to or acted upon. As you can imagine, this has given me a good amount of experience of the whole process such that my ‘popular opinion’ is more akin to an insightful comment.
---
I do also find it bizarre that you think I will find something else to cry about as I have actively praised ArenaNet for stuff that I think is good. For instance I felt episode 4 of LW was a good episode with an all round mix of content. I feel the new pvp map is good, I feel that AnetBenPs communication is good. 
---
People like you always make hefty assumptions about people, and their trends. You would do best to stop :)
---
You'll be fine with the GTX 970.
---
It's only when you go up to 4K before you'd see too much GPU load for GW2.
---
Of course they're scared. We treat the creators of this game like shit when things go wrong. If they tease something early in development, and that something doesn't make it into the game exactly as advertised, the developer responsible will get roasted alive. 
---
So they give us dead silence until the content is finished. Because that's the best way to keep us from overreacting. 
---
They won't change their behavior until we change ours. 
---
With lead the wind strained of course, that’s part of the build, 4 is on autocast!
---
&gt; a feature pack will bring build templates
---
Yeah that's how you know it's fake.
---
And then give me half of your earnings
---
gold give aways are impractical in gw2 environment due to 500g weekly received limit and potential risk of being flagged as gold trader; item giveaways happen more often
---
Yeah I can see that. I can just hope that Arenanet will at least have the courtesy of warning us more than a week or two ahead if they intend to go into maintenance mode, but my best guess is that we'll be safe at least until Season 5 is finished. Beyond that, who knows. You can ride the GW1 nostalgia train only for so long, too, even if my favorite continent (Cantha) is still missing completely.
---
You stopped having anything interesting to say a long time ago bud. Just stop it now, you're embarrassing yourself, it's painful to read.
---
You called me a siege monkey and then betrayed that you couldn't into any current fight guilds and then couldn't handle that fact as evidenced by your dumbassery. It sucks to be you, face it.
---
Last Serpent's Ire, I went to with TTS was super easy.
---
It should go well.
---
Hoelbrak was built more than 200 years ago out of necessity after their entire civilization was forced south out of their ancestral homes. Their mentality hasnt changed much. This is reflected well on Eir and Braham's relationship, a mother who couldnt be one because of her Norn Outlook on life. A son who later dealt with the societal preasure of living up to his mothers name. Even old whitebear acted as if the Norn still don't unify under one banner when you go to recruit them form the Maguuma campaign. Norn áre very much the same as they were in eye of the North. Only major difference is that A-Net uses that one track mind as comedic relief. Which is apropriate considering they're taller, lumbering drunks who love a good moot.
---
Would I need to change any settings?
---
Extremely rarely, but more often than you would find them on /r/ffxiv, /r/elderscrollsonline, /r/runescape, /r/2007scape, /r/wow, etc.
---
Most "gold giveaways" I've done were found in-game. I've earned 1 legendary weapon from winning a scavenger hunt, 1 legendary precursor weapon from winning a series of Crab Scuttle races, hundreds of gold from trivia competitions, a couple hundred gold from other races, and a bit from gold lotteries.
---
and nobody cares about your base ranger either, sweaty ;)
---
This is 100% the correct response to this thread.  Arenanet may not have the greatest communication with their player base, but this is mostly attributed to the HARSH player backlash when a strong communication was present in the development cycle.  Arenanet cannot announce what they're working on, simply because if the feature/content they announced doesn't arrive on time (or at all), the players enter a frenzied state of blind rage.   
---
The real problem is exactly as you've stated here-- and it's not even really a problem.  It's the nature of the game that is being developed.   MMOs will ***never*** retain their playerbase across content installations.  People come and people go.   The players you've retained are simply the ones who come back.  
---
   
---
People who leave will always find an excuse to leave.  In this case it's communication, but in the past its been "failure to deliver on promises".   It's truly a situation in which ArenaNet can never win.    
---
    
---
Experience and explore the content you've got in front of you, or simply take a break and come back when there's something fresh.  It's okay to do that.  
---
I like this, it reminds me a lot of the Destiny 2 Weekly/Daily bounties! 
---
I think those are signs of poor writing. I've never been a fan of the games story or its characters and that's 100% on the writers. Outside of Eir and Braham though the Norn, to me, seem way more community based rather than individualistic. Their "story" thing is just a way for them to grow and experience the world. That's my interpretation at least. I guess I have this opinion partially due to my mains being Norns. I get to experience the commander as a Norn and it gives me a different interpretation of their society as a whole, just because of the commanders character.
---
That expression is priceless. It's like she's just gotten done reading the next balance patch draft.
---
Outflanked. Pretty much my bad tho, messed up blind AoE.
---
hey I'm not sweaty, I took a shower 3 days ago and mom says I smell fine
---
I suppose it would have to be my attempt at a [hybrid holosmith](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vdAQJAqanUUB1ahVID+dBcJjF2C77FkhOA9tx3YeE8DtBCAA-jBSAQBnVpXIVGAgHAQXV/htKBBz+DTVPQ0OBABASAuYWMAcxWsSdxWsFTLGLGL2itYkCwPlVA-e) that uses grieving and baelfire to get 100% burning duration and 90% bleeding.  I do use it sometimes in a random raid if we need condi and I am not feeling the other classes I have but hardly see more dps than the BS.  I have loved the flamethrower on my engi and it is the reason I initially made her, so I always try to find a way to keep it "in fashion" for myself.
---
Lol thanks. It's true it's a meme run and i only called out mechanics as that's what i was asked to do, specifically. Many things happening and people watching stream spiked up made me nervous and being distracted with discord DMs cuz high amount of people watching stream live, instead of 1-2 people. Although i can only response shortly like I'm cming &amp; streaming exactly like what i replied to my whisper in game but still hella distracted. Some of the people who watched stream and chatted on it have more kp than these guys and they are more chill cuz it's obviously meme. I don't get why these guys are furious. I'm so bored of running a content so fast, it feels like doing a job. And this is our fun way to learn and laugh =] 
---
I ran gw2 at 2560x1080 (uw) on a 960 and it ran very well.
---
I took an ill-advised break from the game and missed the Twisted Marionette, sadly. I am surprised they've never put it back in as a fractal or kept it as a meta event.
---
&gt; You stopped having anything interesting to say a long time ago bud
---
Yet you're still replying /shrug
---
The monitor Im looking at is the aw3418dw just to clarify iono if the 21:9 ratio would have an effect
---
Just open gforce experience, pick the game and select “optimal settings”.  It will select the best settings for your specific card in the game.
---
They have their places in raids but are barely sought after. You mentioned the biggest reasons for that. It is currently easier to just play as condi DPS, as there are more slots available. It is juhh st too convenient to just grab druids.
---
Just have model limit on medium or lower and you'll be fine.  
---
People started to zone out to omg it's a shitty role model for future druid. Yes it is. But gosh oh my, do they really think that's how i really run with pugs in higher kp groups? Seriously. when as nowadays everyone literally has a healing class available so you could kick and replace that so awful druid like me and be mediocre and still beat the content. Like come on, think. It's a fun meme run and people who asked for it actually learned it better than those short flawlessly YouTube vids cuz we actually says shit that matter in a run and we die like in a real pug run with actual pugs. If I'm with a static, there's nothing to say anymore. And the "learning" is from the call outs which i got specifically asked for when i make this. This is not about what you should be doing as a druid. Geez. 
---
Some of the people responded to chat on stream on stream i swear have more stacks of ess than these salty comments i received from the majority here but nobody pointed out crap cuz it's meme for the sake of meme. Thanks but no thanks. Effort would continue and we'd still have fun and lol learning place. When it's serious, I'll get serious but this is not one of those times. 
---
It is honestly just a fact that balance will never be perfect. It is just how you deal with it.
---
Scarlet was the most meaningful and accomplished antagonist this franchise has ever seen.  There..I said it.
---
I know exactly how you feel. I started shortly after season 1 and found a really nice guild. We did nearly everything together and we loved the game. We were watching the announcement stream for HoT and got hyped and kept screaming of joy. Sadly some time between HoT and PoF the first ppl started to leave (well, it were still the first once). After PoF dropped we quickly noticed that it's quite bad and ended up doing it solo because we just couldn't motivate us to really do it. In the end, I and one or two others pushed everything from PoF (ok, except a few collections) to get everything done.
---
The following LS episodes were also just plain and didn't feel special at all. You could literally guess after around half of the content what would happen at the end.
---
More and more ppl lost their motivation and started to take breaks more often and every time a bit longer...
---
Right now out Discord is mostly filled with just 2-4 ppl who are trying to keep it running somehow.
---
Don't get me wrong the last 2-3 episodes were quite good (IMO) but they are still not so good that they can keep us going for more than a month (and that only because there are achievements that require some time to do).
---
I would really love to see anet to go back to how they performed with HoT because this time was just the best. We had so much to do and the maps felt rewarding and fun. You could always explore it again and again while still having fun.
---
[Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWBDQqyxujE). xD
---
I don't agree that it's the true problem tho. IMO GW2 is always strongest when there's other players participating in events with you. The events can be boring as all hell, other players make it fun even if you never say a word because you did something together.  
---
Without other players it becomes clear how boring these events are, so I suppose you have a point, but as far as I'm concerned give players a reason to stay and their presence can make the most boring task fun.
---
&gt; Wouldn't be surprised if instead of a new expansion we'd get a maintenance mode announcement.
---
I wouldn't mind us moving to GW3 as soon as possible. GW2 made a lot of mistakes during the early months, and we've never recovered from that damage. Take everything GW2, assets and systems, and make a new game with all of that. A game with GW2 wardrobe and mounts from day one.
---
ArenaNet has showed no signs of learning about anything though, and I fear GW3 would just repeat the same mistakes, or even worse (mobile cancer, even worse monetization, etc). But hey, at least it would be better than a slow agonizing death.
---
Taking advantage of it how? If they actively say hey WoW sucks come to GW2 they will get criticised for kicking another game when its having problems. Anets issues come back to its overall PR, there's no PR material out there emphasising the game strengths without kicking other games.
---
Make sense , but what I’m trying to find out is a good comp to carry games , because in ranked lately is basically having 2-3 useless people in team very frequently, so me and my friend are trying one comp that would be able to easy carry ,we tried mirage scourge but I think mirage ranger or guardian would be better 
---
Mirage/Mirage
---
&gt; I don't say gw1 is perfect but rewards were much more satisfying in gw1 and the game world felt more exciting and dangerous.
---
Rewards are pretty much nonexistent in GW2, and the gem store only makes it even worse.
---
gw2raidar.com
---
They could use GW2's engine and assets. They don't need to make GW3 from scratch.
---
MMOs on the whole seem to be a dying genre, likely because of the time investment required to progress -- Battle Royale type games are easy to pick up, play, have some fun, and put down. MMO's tend to be grindfests, and no one has the time (or desire) for that anymore.
---
&gt; "i dont want a unique thing because it makes a spec that isnt designed for condi that nobody plays irrelelvant"
---
Wth are you talking? o.O
---
Reaper is pretty good for condi dmg. There are even traits that benefits only condition stuff, so why would you say it's "not designed for condi"? That's absolutely wrong. 
---
Also your "that nobody plays" is just wrong. Why would you lie?...
---
**YOU GOT A FIIIIIIIIIISH!!!**
---
Living story is something which move on. A season don't move on. It's a "back to the future" over and over again.
---
Two different things.
---
You’re filthy rich with that monitor man
---
"Cats. Cats never change."
---
&gt; They do not create hype because it is better to stay silent and release the product when it is ready (Soon™).
---
This is just wrong, or at least there are other options. The WvW alliance announcement was something I applauded them for, however where they went wrong is then taking far too long in implementing it. The issue is not the announcement it was and is the implementation.
---
The customer ruined the product. Doesnt make sense in any other business.
---
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a role playing game, items and character progression are one of its key elements. Without it, you lose the drive to invest more time on the game.
---
A build isn't "very niche" only because it's not meta, lol.
---
However, that wasn't even the point.
---
I’ve tried watching this before, the audio quality just makes it a hard sit through for me, but I really appreciate their effort to bring this story to players who missed out. 
---
&gt; instant gratification
---
Not really the case here. I'd argue we don't have any gratification to begin with.
---
What we need is long-term progression systems, where it takes time and effort to get your rewards, thus making them valuable and attractive to get. There's nothing like that in the game, everything is obtained by farming mindlessly.
---
I love this idea, I was just about to be like "but wont this make it hard to play with your friends if you're desynced?" but then I saw the partylink thing you added. I really like this idea. Too many times I get on wanting to do stuff but not really knowing what to do so I just do my easy to do dailies and log off. Having a clear, constant river of directions telling me where to go would be pretty rad. They'd be kind've like champion trains without the zerg, since everyone would be desynced for the most part. I can dig it
---
I've been having issues with low frame rates as well. I'm on the DX12pxy mod, and that haled a bit, but lately it seems like FPS issues and high ping are a thing.
---
i7 5960X @ 4.5 GHz / 128GB RAM / OS/Apps on m.2 SSD, Scratch disk is 2x PCIe Drives in RAID0, storage is 2 SSD's in RAID0 / 980Ti -- I shouldn't be having issues.
---
You can also barrier people through the button damage if you are quick with it and they self heal to full before it hits :)
