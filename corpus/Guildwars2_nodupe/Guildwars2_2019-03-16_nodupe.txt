Yup, it's an atrocity and should not be in the game like this. And while we are at it, please remove social awkwardness and birds - basically anything that takes away control over my character's movement and/or is nothing but an annoying hassle (birds).
---
Well firebrands are easy to find. Renegades on the other hand...
---
"Grind out a mount too". Takes at most 8 hours. Get yourself a mount and you will see it will be worth the effort.
---
unfortunately anet seems either too stubborn or maybe there is some technical limitation/other reason for why they don't do it
---

---
it has been requested over time for certain skins found on NPCs across the game for years now..
---
so yea, sorry to disappoint but for one reason or another it's probably not gonna happen
---
Speaking of Darksiders, GIMME A HORSE MOUNT SO MY NECRO CAN COSPLAY AS A HORSEMAN OF THE APOCALYPSE DAMN IT!
---
Bleed Fire is kind of stupid in some fractals, but on its own you can deal with it like you do with Frailty or Outflanked. It just scales badly with many mobs and the daily rotations like to give you exactly those instances.
---
No Pain no Gain is really bad on exactly one fight, Subject 6 if you try to burst him. For LFG groups it actually becomes a tough DPS check, and boonstrips are rare. Same for Sugar Rush, that on Subject 6 is a tough draw.
---
Birds are stupid in hundreds of ways. It's a drain on endurance you have zero control over (i.e. getting birds milliseconds after a mechanics dodge) with no counter or balance. The actual bird spawns aren't even mentioned in the description and mess with everything from combat status to target cap to scaling with certain other instabs like bleed fire, toxic trail or others. I personally think that this instability in particular needs a rework ASAP.
---
Slippery Slope is, as I mentioned in another reply, unfit for fractals and should probably be removed. Social Awkwardness is another one that you can find many places in the fractals for that aren't made with this in mind. The gimmick of not being able to stack is fine, but in some areas you don't have enough space for five players, or some have to eat mechanics because LOL. That's just as dumb and I personally was fine with the pre-patch SA.
---
Yeah true, I'm dropping to sub 30 fps regularly with my newer i5-6600, gtx 960 machine so it doesn't scale well.
---
Pop all your boosters and put your level-up point (dunno what it's name is) into the Warclaw. Usually people would love you to have more supply capacity but there is no use for supplies if you can't keep up with the zerg. Additionally, just follow commanders who give you at least some chance to keep up.
---
I know two people irl that have spent £4K each on Fifa in the last year alone.
---
Trailer after at episode 6 final ofc.
---
&gt;  2 hours every 4 months. Life is Strange has a better schedule than that. 
---
Life is Strange is a story only game, lol. What a comparsion. 
---
If you only rush through the story, ignore everything else and call it an episode, it's your personal problem. Every episode have lots of achievements to do, skins to unlock and things to explore. Every episode contains tons of content, you just ignore it and complain about "the short story" instead. 
---
About your next few paragraphs -&gt; the same old "we need a roadmap mimimi" thing again? That's yesterday's snow, absolutely obsolete. Answers were made and the topic is done. Why do you still annoyed with it?
---
LW3-4 maps? 
---
- Bloodstone Fen:  Stat swapable ascended trinkets. Since Aurora is the only legendary trinket, the bloodstone trinkets are the cheapest and best ascended trinkets to get. 
---
- Ember Bay: Still a good map for champ/event trains, also a good map for solo karma farm.
---
- Bitterfrost Frontier: Winterberries.
---
- Lake Doric: Leather Farm.
---
- Draconis Mons: Not that much to do, but you can get a very cool, interactive guild deco by playing this map.
---
- Sirens Landing: Meta event has a pretty nice chance for doubloons. Absolutely an alternative to JP's. Plus a T5 wood farm area which gives you ~60 wood within 2 minutes.
---
- Istan: I think we don't need to talk about this map, since it was the best farming map until that last patch. Now it's still a worthy daily run. Plus the Sunspear Caches run, with gives a decent amount of loot and the chance of a 50g weapon.
---
- Sandswept Isles: Good spot to get Karma.
---
- Kourna: Don't ask me...
---
- Jahai Bluffs: New world boss and the chance of an expensive infusion. Another event with the chance of an endless Djinn tonic.
---
- Thunderhead Peeks: Haven't done everything there yet, so I can't say. 
---
- For all LS4 maps: Daily Adventures (mostly griffons). Gives quick loot and tons of Exp. You can literally finish every new masteries within like 15 minutes only by doing griffon adventures.
---
There are reasons to play all these maps and if you visit one, you will find peoples doing these things, even in Kourna. 
---
I suppose so. I guess I'm used to other games having a designated trade chat for transactions and many games manage to operate just fine with people pushing for what they're selling. And if the argument is that TP provides a tax for gold sink purposes then you can implement it into a mail trade system. The removal of tax isn't the main point of the idea.
---
Shiro used double swords; that's what he's wielding in his image...
---
but you know; that's like a thing you would know if you read anything.

Starting your journey to take down the Elder Dragons, huh? But due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;questioning session&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).

If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.

Free? You mean they are doing it for charity purposes and we didn't pay for an MMO? Or do you mean that, if they didn't do it we'd still be playing this game after a small amount of time?
---
It is not free, their model is buy to play with in-game purchases. "Free" updates are there to sell more in-game purchases as they need to keep you interested and add new things to add new skins to etc.
---
I'm sorry but it is just dumb to say "hurr it is free why hate?". GW2 is not free. End of that topic right there. And people would simply laugh at them if they tried monthly sub with such little content delivery as well and they know it.
---
gankdara
---
Me as well.
---
Down for me too
---
[removed]
---
I'm in game and it says the login server cannot be found. Chat is broken too.
---
Login took a while and all of my HoM achievements are currently missing.
---
same here
---
NordVPN does actually work fine for gw2 though. But you don't need nordvpn to get around campus firewalls for gw2 specifically.
---
Login servers appear to be dead too, so might be something going on with the game in general
---
yeah I couldnt enter PVP lobby
---
This is a very solid argument from a story-telling perspective, but I can't help but feel it would have been perfectly okay in that he was focused on Aurene and Balthazar in the PoF story. And yes /u/LinguisticallyInept is right, I hope this isn't a technological precedent that will affect the future of how the elder dragons are depicted because it would be totally annoying and at this point noticeable specifically because of his general size already being established.
---
Get Rings from pristine fractal relics and infuse them, salvage them for matrixes--
---
Sell your entire bank, dont keep anything - why do you want to have a full bank while being broke.
---
Get Fractal God done and get even more bonus loot.
---
Get a good team so you're done with t4 + recs (maybe CM) within an hour.
---
Deal damage, you should get 30k ish easily because bosses can be stunned unlike the golem.
---
Down for me in North East US. Never have an issue logging in.
---
I can't get in either. :( And WvW reset is soon. 
---
It's retired, though. Can you still progress/get AP for retired achievements?
---
Same... can't log in to the game or https://account.arena.net/login
---
NA side seems to be down
---
appears to be down
---
yeah, lfg is broken for me probably tied to login servers.  I'll try again tomorrow I guess.  Have a g'friday night y'all. 
---
Yeah I couldn't log in either
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's actually  not so bad, I'm MOSTLY an fps player ( I play STALKER: Anomaly, wildlands and I guess skyrim among others) like, for example, anomaly  is good for it because it has diferent buttons for nightvision, flashlight, Geiger counter, suppressor, etc. I'm pissed logitech kept volume controls out of optional keybinds though because FN key volume buttons sux
---
Ninja didn't use katana.
---
I only have four mouse buttons that do anything in GW2. M1 -&gt; primary click. M2 -&gt; move camera. M4 -&gt; heal ability. M5 -&gt; weapon ability 2. Then, I massively overhauled my keyboard layout. To start, you don't need strafe keybindings. M2 + A/D strafes. To give a brief idea, my skill bar keybindings looks like this: \`, M5, 1, 2, 3, M4, E, R, F, 4. My interact key is Q. Profession skills: Z, X, C, V, B. (B can be awkward. Sometimes, I use my thumb instead of stretching for it). Shift for mount/unmount. Tab for weapon swap. Binding M3 for profession skill 1 and then just doing Z, X, C, V for the others would makes playing chrono much easier, but meh. M3 is my scroll wheel, so I don't want to accidentally scroll when I'm in the middle of combat. I also have a modifier button on my mouse, but i use it to make M4 and M5 map to volume control.
---
Joined a party and disconnected so hope they arent waiting for me
---
What the hell is an MMO mouse?
---
Holy shit, the orgiastic martial history nerdgasm that just exploded in this thread.  
---
Side note: There is already a katana skin in GW2, but good luck getting animations to match the fighting style associated with Samurai.
---
GW was never trying to be historically accurate. GW1 Factions meshed all Eastern asian cultures into one. In plenty of games I have seen ninjas using light, two-handed curved blades.
---
Can't login reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Yeah, I was having issues with the Black Lion shop. Attempted to relog and cannot.
---
This game definitely has less binds than, say, WoW.  But having 6 new instacast mounts does complicate things.
---
Are you honestly going to sit there and claim that streaming the run wouldn't constitute proof?
---
I see 5 side buttons. Those are enough.
---
Keep in mind only Fractal Gods can get that much money tho, normal players only get 5 encryptions from 61!
---
You will only get half of the money (well ... 5/9) an endgame player will earn so you sit at about 20g/hour from encryptions + about 10-15g in loot, you'll still get about 35g/h but you better upgrade to fractal god since encryptions are where the money's at.
---
So for the casual 61 pays you about 30-35gold with a bad team and 35-40gold with a good team per hour, its all about the dps - if you deal more damage you're faster and get more loot per hour. So deal damage at all costs, if you have a chronomancer in team there is no need for quickness since he can provide that himself with his ult + timeshift so get more DDs and no more supports.
---
If you're a fractal god you get shittons of money so its worth even more the more time you sink into it.
---
Anet should introduce a rent-a-mount....i dont know like,50 silver for a buff that give the possibility to use the mount untill reset.
---

---
i could personally burn about a million stacks of auric dust to make golden things for my guild hall, i really cant ever have enough... those guild decorations are awesome. saved you those 3 slots + your mats tab slot.
---
I LFG as renegade healer and I get a firebrand in 1/5 of my groups if I stay on it.  Meanwhile every group already has a druid, so I end up having to reroll to holo or banners every day.  It's all relative.
---
I used the Darksiders series to get my GF into gaming she's loved every minute of it so far, even got 100‰ completion on DS1. She's about to beat Darksiders 2 and this is all very discouraging to read. I've been pretty stoked about 3,its a shame to see this. 
---
We'll be trying it anyway though, maybe she'll still enjoy it.
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/laurels
---
Oh yeah, and those - same props as the skritt ones, I believe.
---
Come on Character Slots! I can almost taste it!
---
very much the dead players do no dps
---
God I love my G600 for this game 
---
Takes me around 30-45 minutes per map. I skip all dynamic events (unless heart related) If you complete one map per hour you are doing fine.
---
This, so much this. So many fights specifically require exact positioning and movement so when you remove the ability to use that with no counter you just make everything frustrating. It’s super bad design and like Zman said extra frustrating on certain classes.
---
Those looked horribly uncomfortable to use
---
I like how ESO sells personalities changing your idle animations. But, selling visual upgrades to skill particle effects and animations will be very controversial among the community.
---
Yeah, we all know that I'm referring to the effort put in, 434343 spam basically with some modifiers thrown in. Although, daredevil is a bigger joke. Dodge, 2 1. Rotation complete, yaay, thief so satisfying \*cough\*
---
&gt; But to get the mount you don't need to grind
---
OP is playing WvW for the first time. In order to complete the first warclaw collection, you have to have a WvW level of 50 or greater… I would call 50 WvW levels a grind.
---
That and they are also actually useful in a zerg.
---
Guild chat was down for me less that 30 min ago
---
Because its one and done content. Not since Heart of Thorns have they made open world content that last more than a week or two.
---
Yes, they exist in the lore and one od the novels very briefly mentions them. A lot of dialogue throughout both games do, particularly for gw2 in relating different tribes od centaurs to different breeds of horses.
---
Came here to say this. 
---
You could spend them on T4 mats for 75s per laurel right now.  If someone isn’t willing to sell their laurels for that price I doubt that they would sell them for MCs (which would probably spike drop in price to equalize with the fine crafting mats at the release of the change).
---
Then they would hang out at about the same price.
---
You forgot:
---
* Banished Dream Riders in gw1
---
* Celestial Horse in gw1
---
* Iron Horse Mines in both games
---
* A seraph in DR who compares centaur tribes to horse breeds
---
* Canthan lore that tells us that thr first emperor, Kaineng Tah, died from falling off of his horse.
---
* Edge of Destiny has Logan and Caithe seeing a field with horses through a malfunctioning asura gate
---
* several common phrases with the word horse being used (e.g., "old warhorse" referring to an old soldier)
---
cant que in pvp at all
---
still cant que
---
If you're SEA, try jumping on around 7PM\~8PM Seoul time (GMT+9). That's the usual start time for SEA prime time depending on your server. Can always check with your server's discord, website or TS3 for more information. If you're not sure about your server info, probably easier to ask in WvW map/team chat.
---
You’ve got pretty much my thoughts, up until the food bit. While it can last multiple bosses, pugs are notorious for taking forever, or just being trash. It takes time to build that trust back up, until then, I don’t feel like wasting 1-2g per food, and bail after a bad group, to waste a bunch of it waiting around, to then waste more for extra pulls. It’s why I carry BIS and SBIS foods.
---
I spent several years playing with a touchpad-- I adore my g600 and would prefer not to play without it anymore, but I played basically everything with just a touchpad, or with a basic logitech wireless mouse with just left click, right click, a scrollwheel, and bindable buttons tilting the scrollwheel left and right (I made those dodge and heal, since I already changed my other skills to be around the movement keys.) 
---
*something something prices are only high because people have thousands of stacks hoarded something something it's on the players to burst the bubble something something*
---
Came here to say this to that.
---
WvW doesn't give any exp anymore.
---
Also exp gained in GW2 has always been percent based. After the NPE changes lv 1-15 also requires half the expected amount so those levels actually go by twice as fast.
---
Still nothing posted on Twitter. 
---
This is completely incorrect. Firstly, you cannot complete the old mini achievement because that depended on putting miniatures into the bank's material storage which is a feature no longer available in the game ever since the wardrobe. The mini collector title you got comes from the **new** mini collector achievement, which requires putting the minis in the wardrobe.
---
Secondly there are many activities of historical achievements you can still do - such as buying an omelette from that one crazed sylvari in Southsun Cove, or just doing crab toss - which will not trigger the achievements. Another prime example being almost all historical festival achievements. You cannot complete 2012 Halloween achievements at all anymore.
---
You cannot progress any achievement in the Historical category.
---
Lfg still broken for me, can’t join any group. 
---
Does the birthday buff work with pvp as well?
---
Heal scrapper does so much cleansing its completely ridiculous, most of the condis In zergs will actually get converted to boons by the “purity of purpose” trait on engi 
---
This issue was talked about so many times over the last 7 years.  Anet purposely did this to prevent scam, and to use as a way to control coin value.  They will NOT ever allow direct trade windows anymore.  If you do use mail system, Anet will not assist if you get scammed.
---
My problem is that i never find a zerg during the day so by the time they start up i get maybe 1 to 2 hours and then its time to put my kids to bed. So sounds liks im better of just farming pvp
---
I remember D1 of Kamadan would just flow endlessly with trade spam.  If you wanted to talk to someone, you had to switch maps.  It was bad.

Honestly, dungeons feel almost more alive that latest content these days. I think that's a problem. I'd say that LFG is quite representative of at least group activity in the game.
---
\*because HoT maps are better.   
---
PoF maps are similarly as dead as LW maps IMO.
---
I thought it was funny.
---
You can go to Edge of the mist, where mounts and glider isnt allowed. There you can do all objectives for mount.
---
Yeah, that makes sense for WvW.  I was, indeed, talking of its uses in Raids as that is all I seem to do these days :x
---
Oh. Well that definitely could have confused matters.
---
I use flamethrower Engie, really great for taging and stability. See build here: https://youtu.be/HiCl2scdnU8
---
During Halloween, I switch to shortbow/staff Daredevil, with lots of dodge and speed to keep up with everyone.
---
That mouse has 5 macro keys to use realistically.
---
Rmb and lmb upper mouse could be used to mount or look back. You can also click the scroller for look back just like you would do in shooter games
---
The side 3 keys that is crucial in PvP would be 1.) stow/equip 2.) About face (turns your character and cam 180 degrees 3.) Toggle action cam on/off
---
You can look up in the subreddit why such could be useful
---
Lol. That was great.
---
Still can be used as a niche build in some places.
---
Limited bag slots is the reason why I'm reluctant to try playing another proffesion. Shared slots helped a lot, but you still have to deal with limited inventory space.
---
It depends on what you play. If you play an engi, I can't imagine not owning one. Other classes, not too bad. 
---
Did mot know u could get hp from pvp thought it was per map lol
---
Just to be clear, it's really easy to keep up the participation once you reach level 6. It may take some time to reach it if you are by yourself but just taking sentries and camps will do the trick.
---
After that you just have to not let it decay by being afk for too long. Kill a guard somewhere, maybe flip a camp, kill a veteran creature, almost anything will do and a zerg is not required.
---
Better than destroying their brassieres
---
I've just done it to the point of never wanting to do it again! 
---
Solo adventurer DESTROYS flaming hot braziers 
---
Sigh. I'm just bored of running in circles round Bitterfrost Frontier. Thanks
---
While I don't know about fucking that hitch. I  play with the second cheapest mouse and keyboard I could find and do find and it's all good. 
---
Yo you know that the problem is not because of demand for mystic coins is high, right?
---
It's people hoarding and not wanting to sell. Dun worry MCs will drop drastically next story or raid if it were to come with the last second gen legendary: the greatsword
---
Loool Google knows your preferences
---
i just buy heavy crafting bags, those mats are needed for legendaries and they sell like hotcakes
---
Who would want a horse that could talk back?
---
owooo
---
It is and this is just shameless karma-whoring
---
Staff/Dagger can't be used at the same time.
---
Not necessary.
---
lol
---
Am I the only one who enjoys map completion and don't feel the urge to rush it?
---
You can just do zerk weapons axe + focus(force + frenzy) and scepter + dagger/torch (frenzy+bloodlust). I personally love frenzy but many ppl don't like it.
---
Marauder armors with strength rune and Cavalier amulet/rings/trinkets/back. The more confident you are at surviving the less cav gear you need. Can always throw more marauder/zerk for extra dmg.
---
Curses223 scourge121 (CD on heal, breach and stab is nice while harbinger shround is a lil' too weak)
---
The last one can be soul reaping112(more dmg) or spite113(more boon corrupts).
---
That's a basic scourge build
---
Sorry in advance typing all this on phone is hard .
---
wow amazing analysis
---
Thank you!
---
That's right, you have to go dagger/staff.
---
I have a g502 and its completely fine. You don't need an mmo mouse for this game tbh.
---
You 100% do NOT need an MMO mouse. The mouse I have has two side buttons, which I only use for targeting enemies (nearest enemy and the other button hovers AoEs over the enemy). Other than that, opening my inventory is middle click, skills 1-6 stay the same but 7 is on Q, 8 is on E, 9 is on R, and 0 is on X. Mounts are on Z (raptor), N (skimmer), B (Springer), U (Griffin), and J (Jackal). It works quite well for me personally but just test your setup and mess around with a little bit. It may take a while to learn and be a bit annoying at first but you will get used to it.
---
Unless i am mistaken, ranger doesn't seem have a lot of AOE skills.
---
This was really well done actually. Gave me a good laugh!
---
I've yet to see a scrapper. What do they do well? I'd love for more healers to make a debut.
---
Help me plz
---
I wonder if it would work to prevent death by buttons on Xera, or will it not reset the stack like downstate does?
---
Differing opinions on things like this are why actual speedrun communities tend to have multiple categories like 100%, any%, glitchless, etc.
---
One is not necessarily more valid than another, it’s just a different set of rules.
---
FINELY controlled movement. That means something like a small platform you have to jump to. Movement on less than 90 radius space. You know, where every milimeter counts, where you'd edge your way forwards.
---
What you are talking about is normal movement. In a circle of &gt; 400 radius. Thats... Idk... I wouldnt even call that controlled movement, and sure as hell not FINELY controlled movement.
---
But that aside, your problem at Skorvald and Siax isnt actually slippery slope. Its slow cc and low dps or bad support. Because you can either insta cc and burst, or aegis/barrier the attacks you are describing. And if you really look at each complaint in regards to new instabs (or to be more precise: since chrono rework-nerf), thats always the case. People that before could brain afk run through t4 fractals thanks to OP chrono are now faced with a bit more challenge. And instead of adapting their comps, their builds or their playstyle... those players then go on forum and reddit and complain as loudly as possible about how UNPLAYABLE and UNFUN new instabs are. All in the hopes Anet turns t4 fractals in a total snooze fest that they can then... a few weeks later... complain about being SOOOOOOO BORING.

Do you even listen to yourself? Ohhhhh... but I want CHALLENGING CONTENT. But it has to be FUN CHALLENGING CONTENT. And its not allowed to annoy me ! Aaaaaaaaaaaand I dont want to have to adapt my build/comp for it. ANET NERF IT ITS UNFUN!!! ANET WHY ARENT YOU PRODUCING MORE CHALLENGING CONTENT FOR US!!!!!!!111

Damned kids, always stealing my breasts.

I'd love to steal my sister's breast.

greatsword mirage offers the best tagging capabilities by far (both instant damage and high target cap, which is what you want for farming) . however, depending on where you wanna farm, some of the other classes may be better due to factors like mobility or being able to hit before mobs become targetable.

A referral system that converts new \*cash spending\* players into gold (not gems) for players who probably don't need to actually buy more things.
---
mee too.i motify the arcdps.ini but not useful.
---
Can't make it work either, I want to get rid of the shift mod so I can use the build templates without it always choosing all of the lines with the same name and use the "need modifiers to click" so I don't click on the windows in encounters. 
---
because they are not good. Putting all effort and resources into living story instances which most people play only once and then fuck off from the game for 3 months, isn't smart. If at least open world maps had fun, compelling events to do on them, but no. Thunderhead meta is a joke, it was on farm mode 1 day after it released, it's face roll easy and boring. The only good parts of those episodes is story and story is something that most of the population finishes in one day and never returns to it. Such big focus on living story is what will kill this game.
---
Oh my god yes it works.
---
So remove the ";" symbol from start of the row. 
---
yeah;;;;;;god luck;;;;;

Dann Google and saving dearch preferences!
---
Do you even pug fractals or no?
---
For farming and given that mounts exist I would say quickness firebrand. It depends on what "farming" means for you exactly. If you are running meta events you will never be alone so you are traiting a minor loss on personal damage (compared to an power dps thief/staff daredevil without support capabilitys - not the shortbow one ;) ) for huge support. Sometimes you will not have 5-10 good ppl around but with yourself plus two or three additional one's it will add up already. If farming means to also gather all and everything you will stumple upon, a quickness firebrand will net you with a free glyph of industry without loosing the benefits of an actual glyph inside your gathering tools. On top of that you can pretty convieniently tag large groups of enemys if you are using you tome of justice so there is no staff needed. Staff will actually hinder you on events where you want to have selfsustained damage and the staff aa chain traveling speed is often to slow to reliably tag enemys. Same goes for the elementalist staff autoattacks. The radiance traitline will enable you to have the tome constantly up as long as something is dieing around you. That is why you don't need the "archivist of whispers" trait even in large groups of enemys. It is up to you if you prefer condi or power variants. Both will hit hard enough to give you credit and loot for everything you are looking at. Personally I would recommend a condition firebrand but to craft vipers armor can be challenging for newer players. A power firebrand will need only berserkers gear besides some diviner trinkets which you can get from thunderhead peaks. If you are struggeling to keep up movement wise than drop one utility (a signet or a mantra) for judge's intervention but most of the time you should be fine with haste alone. Not many players are actively trying to be upfront all the time - not even in champ trains - and even if you are confronted with a rly nasty situation of getting stuck in combat your tome/weapon range should be more than enough to cover distance. A flamethrower ingi has way less range and is still considered quite strong for tagging. A quickness firebrand will not be always the best option for every situation but you are fairly close to being the best nearly everywhere farming related.
---
I don’t get this question. Does it imply that they’re coming with LWS5, or does it imply that they’re coming with an expansion and Anet should release them 2 years early?
---
Even Dwayna won't be able to help them. Once you pass the line of yiffs and owos, you can't go back, unfortunately. 
---
how is this even related to gw2?
---
So force people who main a certain class to wait for no reason?
---
it really was just an attempt to monetise the mode more with mount skins
---
Not sure why you are downvoted; Kralk took up more than 1/3 the size of the entire sky in the Pof story; was hoping he was as big in the newest episode for the awe factor.
---
Yeah, I would just go with an engineer for farming. Grenade and Mortar kits allow you spammable range AoE and Flamethrower is good cleave. Make sure to trait for faster Grenades when using the Grenade kit in farms with a lot of people.
---
I was on GBL, quitted then cuz of Skilllag, then i was on EBG and quitted again :)
---
Ah thanks! So, I checked it and it seems it requires a certain amount of gold to invest into crafting things with the spirit shards. I can't just turn the shards into gold without spending gold first, right? I have around 1800 spirit shards laying around. 
---
Got if, thanks!
---
source?
---
That's the best attempt at stoking flame you could come up with in the thirty two minutes since your last comment.
---
Are they allowed to use their Weapon skills while mounted? :D 
---
This one isn't funny.
---
Farm fractals like hell and craft/buy them all by yourself
---
Yeah, the devs appear to be pretty attached to stupid ideas. They may correct them one day, but it will usually take a veeeeeeeeeeeeeeery long time. Like in case of boon thieves, probably the only instability that has ever been more stupid than some of the current ones.
---
Absolutely! 
---
Excuse me?
---
apology accepted
---
Spider farm in early HoT days provided the best social interactions I had in this game ever. No raid and no fractal ever game that feeling of playing with my friends while talking many different topics while watching our experienca bars filling up slowly. Not to mention the fun we had "optimizing" our cleaves so everyone can tag every mob. Fun times, that will never return. Maybe with another game.
---
...\*Unzips\*
---
I never understood AP hunting, but thats probably why I refunded path of fire
---
I'm sickened, but curious
---
But even autoattacking should yield much more dps than a healer can produce.
---
I thought asura were smart enough to figure out how to use both.
---
I bought one a few days after starting playing Weaver. A simple one, with "only" 5 additional buttons on the left side. I'm sure that if you're skilled enough you won't need it, but it made playing this spec extremely smoother and more enjoyable.
---
Just face it - this game is not your cup of tea. I dont feel the same about the things you've described at all. 
---
I agree with you on the HOT maps. And the lack of a good tutorial / help explanation page in-game. The other complaints are either lame , or just dumb. Sounds like a different game would suit you better. See ya.
---
lol the post is barely related to GW2 agreed, but you are giving more bait than OP. Kids? Breast Cancer? lmao
---
"No one rides free"
---
The thing with the Replicator is that because it’s worth so much, it’s very easy to propagate misinformation in the hope that it’s true. 
---
I too believed for a while that you could get it from the champ, but it’s unconfirmed that it can no longer drop. 
---
Apparently an intern added those, as an exercise or something like that.
---
Naughty lil cutie :3
---
you shouldn't be playing with the zerk to be honest (at least on higher tier servers) if you don't have meta build and other stuff.
---
if you can't be bothered to get the mount which can be done in a day, you better of just roaming
---
If anet can change aggro mechanics and add in new path-specific mobs, then they can add in a drop to a boss
---
As a four-year player (with one long hiatus), I don't personally agree with this. I love HoT's large, sprawling maps. Sure, a pain to complete, but the depth of the map makes it much more interesting than stuff in PoF.
---
Masteries aren't hard as well, I can easily find out which ones I need to do and complete. Hell, they're even *color-coded* for your convenience. The story bosses aren't that hard either. Agony mechanic makes sense, I wouldn't want to do T4s with a newbie.
---
Seems like this game just isn't for you.
---
Charr hold the dagger with their tails. That's why the rarely seen Charr elementalist dominates.
---
Really sad to hear...  really wish they were fixed, as a collector, I'd really like all those dungeon recipes\^\^
---
We need Margonites with 4 arms, so we can play double Staff Ele!
---
Where's the joke
---
That's a myth
---
I've been making comments and posts similar to this for over a year now, talking about the bugged Diminishing Returns and bugged Recipes to no major avail.
---
They looked at Diminishing Returns and tried to fix it recently, sadly they failed fixing it. I was told they're not gonna relook at it.
---
I assume someday, maybe even soon they'll fix recipes - the diminishing returns change was quite recent and that shows that they're aware of at least some of the major dungeon bugs and care a bit.
---
(unrelated but relevant) they also changed the eggs in Fyonna's room from spawning Elite Spiders when walked over.
---
also Shukov's Launch Codes have never been been implemented into the game, most likely being scrapped for a Dungeon Backpiece instead, pls fix those too anet.
---
r/rulethirtytwo
---
I am tired of ppl like you.
---
The problem is core Tyria was too easy and simple for a large portion of the population who wanted the complexity. I find the HoT maps fantastic. I'm was tired of the flat, core Tyria maps.
---
Obviously not all things will be for all people. I wish you luck in whatever game you end up in.
---
just use "other" as report reason and you can write a specific comment
---
Have you tried Anthem?
---
Til
---
Farm 61, yesterday I had like 1300 something +1 Infusions, enough to get 5 normal +9s ... then just get those Matrix cores and combine them.
---
Just buy them of TP or do 99/100CM.
---
Thanks for all the fish!
---
A bit glassy maybe, but should be fine for general use.
---
&gt; If you aren't into Fractals or raids, you're going to run out of available Mastery points way before you run out of things to put them in
---
There are:
---
15 Core Tyria Mastery Points available in Fractals, out of 82 total. You need 49 Mastery Points to unlock every Core Tyria Mastery. 
---
18 HoT Mastery Points available in Raids(W1-W4), out of 198 total. You need 144 Mastery Points to unlock every HoT Mastery.
---
3 PoF Mastery Points available in Raids(W5-W6), out of 121 total. You need 90 Mastery Points to unlock every HoT Mastery.
---
There are more than enough mastery points out there to complete all trees without doing raids or fractals.
---
I noticed that over the past 24 hrs of me switching, NA EST and PST were stacked, huge que's. This may of been due to reset but still. SEA was dead for us, dragonband consistently stayed stacked in all timezones. NSP isn't all too bad right now. I haven't experienced OCX or EU timezones yet.
---
Did exactly that thanks. Only took 2 more days. Now on to WvW leggy armour...
---
A Friend of mine rerolled from Ele to Necro and is pretty viable in fractals!
---
There is certainly a spot for Necros, you just need to be good.
---
Condi damage isnt as great since your target is dead before your conditions run out.
---
Came here to stop this madness.
---
Was the same thing on blue border and on EB. I was never on red and did not ask if they had skill lag but i would guess they did too. 
---
It was also very obvious to us that the enemies was struggling with the same issue due to movement and respons to pushes and so on. 
---
Fractals are numbered. It refers to no. 61. 
---
Thanks Dak! I've added you and will take a look at the new meta builds! 
---
In what possible way, are they making you work or smth., for example?
---
Mirage by far i would say
---
What you need is a guide, a guide on how to stop doing things you don't like. Yes, some people do need a guide like that.
---
Cuz no-one ever use sb on thief.
---
?!
---
You forgot the best horse, [Gum Drops the Noble Steed.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gum_Drops,_the_Noble_Steed)
---
Mirage has no AOE skills, the only thing is greatsword
---
Wow your love for firebrand is commendable.
---
"Rider LF Ranged DD for Drive-by-shootings!"
---
Sand through glass (if i remember corectly), jaunt, aoe shatters. I never have downtime in aoe tagging, And everything is instant.
---
Also gs with sigil of stamina makes it sort of a permanent dodge/triple beam gs
---
That's why so many people stopped playing fractals, got it.
---
Yeah. Season 1 eased players into higher difficulty content, so now there's that massive gap that not everyone can overcome.
---
They need to bring S1 back.
---
I don't think S2 is that hard, though. I mean it has a couple of harder fights, particularly toward the end, but you can definitely learn in S2.
---
I like it and have a lot of fun with Slippery Slope, even when it messes my positioning on slopes on Urban, or makes me miss marble on f100.It's challenging, but not impossible. Pretty much L2P issue in my opinion.
---
Agreed. If you are having trouble unlocking everything without doing game types that you dislike, then you haven't found all of the mastery points available. I never do raids or fractals or dungeons and I was able to unlock all of my stuff without having to do any of that stuff or without trying. 
---
Go into the achievement pane to see which masteries are still available to you. It may also help to look at lists on the wiki or in guides.
---
Do u mean husbando simulator :3c
---
"pugging"? Arah?
---
I greatly appreciate the reply, but I am not familiar with these terms.
---
Love the asura :D ♥ I also have a simple background for all my characters, they all try to fit a theme.
---
Knight of the Thorn achivement, I'll check that out, thank you!
---
I didn't even know 10 player group "raids" were in this game, thank you!
---
Spend 8 hours hours in wvw and just get the mount. Also, iirc one pvp track gives you the part as well.
---
&gt; I can’t play Civilization VI anymore cause my dodge key does nothing.
---
Legit made me laugh out loud.
---
Still, thank you for the feedback. While it doesn't help me find things to add to my GW2 bucket list, it was a very amusing read.
---
Any suggestion for a super-easy-to-get-into PvP Build? 
---
I asked a friend of mine for a beginner PvP build, he gave me [this soulbeast one](https://i.imgur.com/XHv3WZ5.jpg) and I'm quite enjoying it. Damage output is high, easy to play. Perfect.
---
But you know... It gets kinda repetitive over time. So I'm looking for an easy alternative. Any ideas? :)
---
Episodes come out every few months. If you logged in regularly, let's say once every two months you should have all of them unlocked for free.
---
On the other hand if you didn't logged for 3-4 months or more, it's possible you missed one that came out within that time period.
---
The XP levels for the HOT masteries seem unusually high to me. I was sitting there yesterday looking at it as I have three HOT mastery tracks that aren't complete yet. And instead of the grind, I logged out and did something else. The HOT mastery tracks just don't mean anything to me so I opted out of pursuing them. 
---
I disagree, but only because I can aim blink.
---
My take: op is rank 4k+ and just wants another dick measuring contest
---
Thinking of getting back into World Completion.
---
Back when I last looked at it, I had this in-game overlay which gave optimum routes to take for all the locations - does that still exist?
---
I use the G502 and it's perfect for GW2.
---
Well that would be cool, I thought about flying weapons for elementalist, but honestly, this is a far better idea
---
100x this. I can’t even log into the game anymore. I don’t see the point as the game feels like there is I future. And it’s been radio silence since layoffs. 
---
I keep looking at this reddit. Hoping... praying they announce a roadmap that actually gets me excited... I want to love this game again so bad, but the announcement of ls4-ls5 confirmed no xpac to me, which really translates to no future. 
---
Your ele is prettier than all my lady characters combined.
---
So that's why the map is always full 15 min before the meta begin. Gotta get the multi lootz by leeching...
---
Yup yup! If you do fractals and enjoy boss fights like the one at the end of Deepstone or Nightmare, raids will be the next step up in terms of challenge. They tend to have pretty decent lore, too. If you don't enjoy prolonged, mechanically complex boss rights, you will not enjoy raiding. 
---
In Lion's Arch, go to the Aerodome just south of the fractals portal. Raids tend to work best with guilds, as using pick-up groups can be very unpredictable and they are very tricky to pick up as a beginner as they rely on learning certain mechanics and running more efficient builds than much of the game requires. 
---
If you search for 'training' in the LFG under raids, you will likely find a friendlier group (I've had both very good and very bad rando training groups), but finding an active guild that does raid training will be a much more enjoyable experience. 
---
Didn't say otherwise. 
---
Ok enjoy your diablo immortal.
---
Ah Heal Engi also exists although its niche is super speed, extremely strong heals, and super speed. Half the time though Scrapper is only taken because it's the least worse of the third traitlines available sadly in PvE. 
---
I haven't done fractals in at least a month for this reason.  The new instabilities don't feel like a challenge, they feel like punishment.  My static started skipping Twilight Oasis, Deepstone, and Siren's Reef when they were recs, and there was audible "mom I don't wanna" on Discord whenever they came up as dailies.
---
I miss the days when the biggest groan was 25/50/75 being a rec as it meant a lot of waiting for NPCs to stop talking.  Now... I have everything I wanted from fractals and no reason to persist with them, so I spend that time in other games.
---
Oh it´s just one guy? Thought it´s a group of people
---
You’re not wrong. This game still feels young. But they seem determined to kill it. 
---
Yep you get 10 medals and turn them into the Hero Challenges NPC in the marketplace. 
---
I accidentaly crafter 6 pieces of harrier ascended insignia with 3 pieces of ascended inscriptions aswell, my question would be, 
---
How do i get Harrier recipes for armor and weapons without spending gold on TP ? I looked up and the chances look really gloom. 
---
Stat swapping doesn't work on Ascended recipes so i am a bit screwed over this T.T
---
excuse me?
---
This is a crime against charrmanity.
---
If you enjoy a bit more High Risk High reward with a harder class I'd recommend [Power Revenant](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Herald_-_Power_Shiro) 
---
Best way to explain this build is , very effective in teamfights with Staff 5 disrupt and Elite disrupt from both legendary stances. Very strong burst damage but weak under heavy pressure.
---
Try to roam and help your side lane 1v1 by making it 2v1. One of the most deadliest ganking characters in the game and is a Thief killer if you know the class well.
---
Fair point.
---
I love how guitar solo synced with [Soul Spiral](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soul_Spiral) xD
---
No, it's not L2P issue, at least not for me. I hadn't had issue managing it since day 1. I'm not dying there, even with Frailty on my 8k-hp ele. It's not challenging me, it's annoying me. Much like the other control-impairing cancer, the new SA.
---
I've gotten owned just for stepping out of spawn.
---
Couple of 1v1 roamers just hiding behind a wall next a choke point where people tend to leave spawn from. Waiting there just to burst down one unsuspecting person then stealth away.
---
I've never rolled my eyes so hard in my life.
---
It now sounds more like a romantic getaway than a burning hellscape.
---
Why would u delete a character in first place , you lose the birthday gifts 
---
They all look awesome! Your photographer skills are on point too :D I think  my favorite one is the human druid (and I usually don't like humans, lol)
---
From what I remember, Bounty's additional chance% effect works independently from the Item Booster's additional chance%, so you're not just getting an additional chance for one extra hit, but also a slim chance that its two extra hits (I don't remember where, but I believe someone chained a single node with a consortium sickle a couple times in a row). Additionally I've heard that because the Unbound tools have that multiple tap effect lets it roll for Bounty's extra hit multiple times, though unsure if this also worked for the Item Booster as well. Its been a while (IIRC some of these tests revolved around bitterfrost frontier's berry nodes during LWS3's heyday. I'll try looking around and seeing if I can't find these posts).
---
Do you mean the heel order the claw in the back? 
---
I feel like this isn't brought up enough.  I have everything from special skills to mounts to about face using "Shift + key" style bindings.
---
My theory is that the guide has us take all the forts at once (or taking two alternating forts) to make the loop a bit more solid than the RIBA one. RIBA's flaw is because of how outdated it is that mount movement speed and mobility abilities adds speed to an already slow farm (due to the forts more or less being on a timer, and escort events often have you double back to tag the defense on the fort you just left, just to go back to the fort you just arrived at before the backtrack to tag that one). This might make it so that you just head to the nearest fort under attack following the circuit (which might promote healthier spacing in the farm if the events are spaced out unlike the dense cluster around the commander tag with most current RIBA farms).

Me: hey can you ask the twins if they need the volcano achievements?

That's also because \~15 mins before Tarir begins, TD has just finished so most of the people doing that meta will rush the AB map to get a spot in a populated instance.

Depending on how big your hands are. I have small hands, and with left hand on WASD I can only comfortably reach keys from ~ to 3 in number row. Skills on F keys, number row from 4 and onwards? I have to click. So while, say, ranger and necro were doable, I definitely enjoy the game more now that I can activate those unreachable with left hand skills with buttons on my MMO mouse.

If OP needs a new motherboard, then he can probably get faster RAM too. He's probably still rocking DDR3 RAM rather than the newer DDR4?
---
Edit your original post to add the solution so people visiting the thread can see that it's solved. Otherwise they'd have to scroll through the comments to ultimately find your solution buried here.
---
Out of the human gods in the Guild Wars setting, I want to say Lyssa.
---
ALSO, I would like to extend an offer to a guild I'm in. It's called Friends Vs. Dungeons and it's exactly how it sounds. Shoot me a mail, I can't remember if I'm high enough rank to inv lmao but I can definitely get you in invite!  VeggieCat.6198
---
Easy enough to do that already if you mass siege.
---
Granted something more to counter shield generators would be nice.
---
Why do you have 32gb of Ram but an ancient 1050ti?
---
&gt;Processor: AMD FX 6300 Six Core 3.50Ghz
---
AMD FX CPUs are bad. Anything before Ryzen for AMD is terrible. I own a Ryzen rig.
---
It's not a Deus Ex Machina if it's been set up in the story beforehand.
---
So you just collect ideas from other people and fish for attention, gotcha
---
I honestly don't understand how some people have the mental fortitude to complete the maps over and over again on multiple characters. After 6 years of playing I have one map completion, and even that happened after mounts were released.
---
I understand that chilling around in the open world can be relaxing, and I fully get the satisfaction of popping those sweet PoIs and vistas. But after it's done, especially multiple times, I don't think it'll feel all that rewarding anymore.
---
My biggest beef is with the god-damned hearts though. If map completion was just running around and exploring shit, I might do that on a couple more characters. But completing 300+ tedious, pointless repetitive tasks was enough on the first time around.
---
I love mine. Got it when GW2 came out. Do you need it? Based on the comments, no. Do I love it and feel handicapped without it? Yes I do. 
---
We **were** due for it this month before the layoffs, I suspect we won't get it until late next month, after SAB at the earliest.
---
Anyone knows if the cap is still at 69 characters ?
---
Tempest/Elementalist is quite well designed in this instance, it's just that most other supports are overtuned, have loaded Kits and hardly ever have to make build choices/sacrifices/comprises. 
---
Glad you liked my shitty joke. I know how you feel, though.
---
As a non WoW player I can not help you relate it.  However if you do not have any expansions you can not play revenant as it's an extra class that comes with the HoT expansion and it sounds like your f2p right now? Correct me if I am wrong. You will find revenant in a leveling manner similar to warrior or guardian.
---
1. It is both though generally melee unless you are playing the renegade elite spec which tends to use a short bow for condi damage.
---
2. Leveling is easy though imo all class leveling is easy you just have to learn how the class plays. (Mesmer is one of my mains) That said rev is particularly a cake walk being a heavy armor bruiser type class.
---
3. I play them both I prefer gerald for open world stuff due to its mobility and power damage burst. I also play renegade for damage or support in fractals and raids.
---
4. You should never boost a class you have never played before as you will not know how to play it and may find you do not actually like it I suggest saving boosts for a second if a favorite class. (I have two theifs/warriors/mesmers/necros)
---
I just took those icons to be a visual reminder to us as to how much magic Kralkatorrik has gathered to make us realize that he is going into a "final form" mode on us. 
---
Its helpful for /crossarms
---
1050ti is good.
---
Leveling is easy, but a bit boring without the elite specs.
---
I wouldn't boost. It's easy to level, and the only way to get good at energy management is practice.
---
the problem is, there don't seem to be any other viable options for how the story could advance without her (kralk has to be dealt with asap or we fail, and 100% of our efforts are on this plan), unless they pull something new out of their ass in episode 6 (aka deus ex machina)
---
also aurene did use mordremoths(?) power to corrupt sylvari, so its likely jokos power can also be channeled
---
just checked it and nope, it doesn't reach the ground 
---
Obviously you're going to get different opinions but for me revenant is pretty boring. Each legend has it's own set of utility skills giving you zero diversity. It gets very bland after awhile. The legends and traits you pick based on your build are very stream lined so it leaves little room for build creativity and theory crafting.
---
While you are definitely correct, it is essentially still the same concept. Someone died, but oh wait that doesn't matter because here is an undo/redo button.
---
So while the other commenter did use the term incorrectly, they're also not wrong about it being a convenient plot twist to make the previous episode seem pointless.
---
The discounted character slots on sale today can be helpful, with some inventory bags you could increase your total space by a bit, try another class, and obtain the rewards from leveling. 
---
HELP youtube turned german and i cannot undo it!
---
Go play  Facebook mobile games then
---
Aurene resurrection idea is lame as fuck, therefore it's 99% what's going to happen.
---
It was cheap. and I had 4gb of ram when I did that upgrade. 
---
Gosh, i like reddit
---
Oof 
---
so more like 4 hours of content every  4 months and then you have the option of repeating braindead, uncoordinated farming on dead maps for little reward.
---
Also Jahai doesn't have a new boss; it has an old boss with one mechanic switched out for an easier one. 
---
Or add the recipe to the dungeon token store for a lot of tokens, 2.5K+
---
Technically you can have 70.
---
"If an account had the maximum number of character slots before purchasing the Deluxe or Ultimate edition of Heart of Thorns, it's possible for it to have 70 character slots instead of 69."
---
What was weird for me is that it mostly only happen with GW2.
---
while that's a fair point (and i did use deus ex incorrectly but i didn't really know what else to call it) i think that if you're gonna do  "ou-of-left-field twist they should have consequences and having aurene just come back because "joko magic" is just trying to have their cake and eat it with their cliffhanger.
---
How do find people to do specific champion bounties?
---
Why is this a guessing game?  
---
Ideally you should have tried to play each class to level 10ish and maybe playing around in PvP lobby areas a little before setting on a main, let yourself experience how they play.
---
its almost like the maps with entertaining events that encourage cooperation with other players are the ones people playing an MMO will want to spend more time with. 
---
Tag up, advertise in map chat and hope.
---
I was going to say the same thing. If you aren't used to having boots with a cleared heel it feels really weird at first unless you have a pair with a thick sole under the ball of you foot to compensate. If I had a dewclaw Id rather use a heel than rip out my nail. 
---
RIP gem conversion rates.
---
Dump shiro for dwarf. Spinning hammer with staff 1 is top dps on lord. The dwarf elite is op in fights. Shiro is a bit selfish.
---
I mean, I have played on a laptop with just key-binds and the track pad for the past 6 years, so definitely not "necessary". But I almost exclusively play PvE, and get trampled every time I wonder into WvW or PvP. It's main benefit is in movement and reaction time.
---
Right now, it's 800 gems for a Copper-Fed-Salvage-o-Matic. However, it MIGHT go on sale sometime this month for the March sale. If so, it could be around 600 gems, meaning if you have 400 gems, you can trade some gold for the rest. Honestly, whenever people ask what the first thing they should buy is, most everyone suggests this tool.
---
If you have HoT and don't have all of S3, get Bitterfrost Frontier (S3E3)
---
It's the easiest way to get ascended trinkets.
---
What a fascinating theory.
---
None of us have ever thought and theorized this before.
---
Thanks for sharing, but I don't give karma...so you need to wait for someone else to give you internet points.
---
Well, you have to buy the commander tag or earn the mentoring badge from a mastery before you can use them. After that, you can tag up somewhere in the party UI.
---
lmao you win the internet today
---
Adding the useful slaying potions &amp; sigils for the fractal dailies would increase the value for those entries. 
---
There are also other valuable consumables like Ash Legion Spy Kit for the Molten Underground frac.
---
I remember when the BL store started working and I turned every single penny into gems to buy skins, minis and stuff. God, gems were costing copper back them. Only if I knew... 
---
So not the extra revealing Asura clothing that we were discussing a week or so ago? 
---
My bad, missed that line, but i also have not run into that experience.  🤷‍♀️ Maybe thats due to specific utils? May be worth testing.
---
Are you a fucking idiot? You can't counter slippery slope or work around it. It renders a lot of skills on classes completely useless, that's not good gameplay. Don't be a stupid dumbass.
---
What is the best thing to do with unused exotics that cannot be sold on the TP? E.g. I have some pieces of account bound bladed armor (I think from the HoT rewards?), should I just salvage them or chuck them in the mystic forge or something?
---
The ones with subs and endless gear grind do.
---
You've said it before and so have a billion others. It's the No. 1 theory. 
---
To make a new thread for this was not necessary. To reinforce that dragons channel the power they consumed doesn't bring anything new to the table. 
---
The 2 I have noticed it with are magnetic aura and chrono focus 4,5 with the trait.
---
Makes sense, ive been leaning on guar/rev and havent been using those other two in my fractal groups recently
---
HoT maps are hard at first, but as you learn them and get masteries going, you can travel the maps quick and fairly easy. Specially with a mount.  
---
Large energy bars on creatures shouldn't be an issue. Grab more CC or simply kill the monster without using CC. If you can't kill it alone, you're probably a bad player or you are attempting to try monsters that are clearly meant to be taken down by groups of people.  
---
Obtaining masteries across all areas of the game is very easy. I really don't see how you can keep running into max XP walls. Matter of getting those masteries first. You barely need half of em to get to max mastery rank atm.  
---
Currencies are a mess, i can agree with you on that. But regardless, you learn to handle them properly with some wiki info and things like gw2efficiency  
---
Bosses who regain 100% health? Where does that happen and how often. Or is it because you died and are complaining about the boss resetting?  
---
WvW's big crowds don't always mean you will win. And even IF that's the case, then you're free to go form your own smaller party/squad to go elsewhere on the map and be helpful. 15fps really only happens if you have an older system or a laptop or have Player quality and quantity settings on max when you shouldn't have.  
---
Sub 60fps again only happens if you have a pre 2012 mid tier GPU and/or sub 32nm Quad core CPU without HT/SMT in areas where the population is huge. I'm running gw2 maxed out (other then Player quality/quantity and the useless super sampling which is essentially a really bad form of AA) on 60fps easily with a freaking 2400g and it's Vega 11 IGPU.   
---
Can't comment on the agony in fractals, haven't touched them in ages.  
---
Achieves menu, again, use GW2Efficiency and make your life a lot easier.  
---
Be glad there's a wiki to rely on and easily accessible by the "/wiki hurrdurr" command. It's one of GW2's best features and it's a luxury many other games simply do not have. Have you played EvE? Lotro? Rift? It's a nightmare compared to GW2.  
---
TL;DR: Take a break / Leave if you dislike the game in it's current state.  
---
Oooh, wiki out of date or did I miss that part?
---
They are still obsessed with reinventing the wheel every time so content is cast aside once their next new shiny obsession comes up.
---
I get that you want to feel like your idea is *super proprietary* and you love to have it be called *the esteemed noplaynocry’s revolutionary RIBA farm method,* but nobody gives a shit unless you actually tell us how to do it. 
---
That's the spirit ;)
---
It wasn't terrible considering the price, but they are definitely aged much worse than same gen intel CPUs.
---
&gt; you waste your burst to kill their mount
---
I legit got dismounted by a thief's Heartseeker yesterday (crit 11K HP) from stealth. I don't know how easy/difficult it is to pull off, but *please*, you can't tell me that they wasted all their burst on dismounting me.
---
I can't remember the conditions, but it's abnormal.  If I recall, you needed to have the max characters before the first expansion came out.  
---
You can see several of the accounts with 71 on GW2 efficiency.
---
If I have 9 character maxed (one of each class) and 1 level 49 bag alt, what can I use additional slots for? Storage?
---
A shit I'm going to have to buy a lot more gems now. 
---
I see your point, but as would be the problem with any other new race. 
---
A new race offers a new, shared starting option many players desire, especially when thinking about starting a game, however makeshift it is. 
---
Using the already existing different looks, we could f.e. use returned Mordrem, ANet would have many upsides of creating a wholely new race while avoiding some downsides aswell as safe massive amounts of time. Ofc. this would require introduction, but so would any other new race. The introduction of already known Ethnicities / Cultures as new race could also be kept somewhat Shorter and offer a great way of showing off a Little more About them. 
---
This would be a quick way to offer such a restart option and give players a little hope about being someday getting a completely new race. 
---
Yes, hearts are the not so fun thing about it. But, I completed the map with “only“ 4 of m characters and found always some new things. Funny dialogues, new events, got some legendary achievements etc. It is nice to chill out doing some maps while listening to music. 
---
For me fractals, boss events are just the stupid farms are boring, so I skip these, cant understand how someone can farm like 4 hours doing the same thing, every day.
---
When I was new, there were always a few charr from the same guild standing outside a bar in the black citadel doing the crossed arms pose. I was kind of intimidated to talk to them and never did but I figure some might get curious, and it was obviously a recruitment tactic. 
---
open vs sell fractal encryptions?
---
Bags yesterday, character slot today?!?! Stop doing this to me AneT!
---
Exactly, death has become extremely cheap in gw2 and it would be nice to have an actual meaningful death for once. Having Aurene just pop back to life next episode will just feel like Anet saying: "That huge emotional impact we were trying to get out of you was just us having fun, now let's get back to the story." It will seem like they wrote in Aurene eating Joko to be a planned dues ex machina to allow them to kill her with no consequence which also cheapens an amazing villain like Joko to just being a plot device and doesn't do him justice.
---
&gt;Good storytelling involves having strong themes and characterization that are carried throughout the plotline and are ultimately the key to resolving the story.
---
You know what else is a core theme through the Guild Wars universe? Ascension. They can achieve everything you said using a far grander theme and conclusion that the mists and ascension can provide rather than eating Joko in a LS episode. I'd much rather have a resolution involving stuff that was a huge part of gw1 and brought back into gw2 and even directly called in the last episode.
---
My hope is that she is physically dead, everyone is grieving, but then she appears from the mists. Everyone is still accepting that she is dead and will probably stay that way (supported by Eir and Snaff coming back for a time previously) but have a renewed hope and join the fight in the mists. And Anet can even bring back the human gods since Kralkatorrik threatens even them now, everyone makes a last stand and we can have a grand finale in the mists, make it in the Fissure of Woe to top it off.
---
That seems much better than "Oh Aurene's back, now let's go finish off Kralkatorrik while he is crippled."
---
How come noone has mentioned [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases) yet?
---
&gt; and the anomalously low unlock-rates on GW2 Efficiency
---
That seems more like normal than anomalous since those recipe sheets have very low drop rate to begin with.
---
Contact support, they'll usually refund the difference when you make a purchase so close to the sale.
---
Yeah, because you do what else on "popular" maps like VB, TD, DS, SW? Oh, right! *Braindead farming*!
---
&gt;for little reward
---
Seems like you never tried the karma ones or even the wood spot in Sirens Landing. But yeah, complaining without knowing sht is what ppl can do at best. 
---
&gt;Also Jahai ~~doesn't~~ have a new boss; ~~it has an old boss~~ with one mechanic ~~switched out for an easier one.~~ *that's the same. Rest are new mechanics.*
---
Let me correct that for you. 
---
Seriously, tha new shatterer only has a similar model (ocf) and shares only **one** mechanic with the old one and that's his knockback stomp.
---
Everything else is completely different. But well, "*it looks like the old shatterer, so it's just a copy*" right?
---
Little trick: the name change contract has [a dynamic checkbox](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:NameChangeContract.jpg) that can tell you if a name is taken, so you don't have to punch enter to ask if you can have a name.
---
&gt;Skill ceiling is incredibly high on Rev but it’s fun getting there yourself
---
Higher than Mesmer?  I'm pretty trash.
---
Anomalous by definition refers to deviation from the set. eg, no one runs HotW P2,3 yet more people have unlocked the recipes from those paths than the commonly-run P1 (ring of blood)
---
The 2-3 month cadence ends on the 8th of April but with the layoffs it could be delayed.
---
As someone else said, you have to learn where the new people spawn in each zone and just hang out there. Look for people without guild tags. 
---
In general, advertise in mapchats, put down a guild banquet and watch for people without guild tags (that’s how my best friend got recruited into our guild) also there is /r/guildrecruitment that you can utilize to get people to help ya get started. 
---
If you’re looking for members to help you build and grow the guild let me know! My acc name is my flair (although I won’t be on for a while have to work) the fastest way to get a hold of me is on here or discord. Just message me for my discord tag if you want it. 
---
even if aurene comes back we probably would need to find something new to fight kralk with given what happened last time
---
Theres many reasons: The allure of anything undiscovered, new creation Options, a new starting Option you share with all Players, to just name a few.   
---
The latter is probably the biggest reason in GW2 for most People. 
---
Also it would offer a new perspective and a Chance to clean up some undesired loose Ends in the Story, f.e. what happened to the returned mordrem? What about that second pale tree, and how is the Crystal Desert working without Joko?
---
Then theres the harder to implement races, f.e. the Tengu, which are even more interesting in many aspects.
---
Introducing a new race also gets you immense Magazine Coverage and interest, since many players care lots about that kind of stuff.
---
&gt;Having Aurene always near to solve everything for us is indeed bad
---
Anet has definitely written themselves into a corner with that one with all the Glint's legacy stuff and Aurene's purpose all starting way back in HoT and all throughout the story up until this point.
---
The CPU has poor performance and you should really consider upgrading but one thing you could try is to disable every second "core" via affinity mask.
---
Bulldozer has this weird thing going where every 2 "cores" share one FPU, so halving your cores but having one full FPU per core might net better performance.
---
The core stat ones can be bought from the crafting trainers for fairly cheap. 
---
&gt; warclaw legit killed roaming
---
it didnt, ffs. ganking is not roaming. ppl who roam **want** to fight. and they will fight when you meet them. no matter the mount.
---
Oh he was definitely multiboxing. They all afk'd and one of them is a mesmer, which he used to portal all "alts" from grand chest to the next one.
---
It wasn't even subtle anymore.
---
Haven't played since end of HoT and want to return. Does Herald have smooth rotation?
---
Man...  The more I learn and play, the more I see a possible conclusion that GW2 and I just aren't compatible.
---
It just doesn't seem like all classes overwhelmingly excel in one area, but are short in others.  I mean, my Mesmer for example just doesn't seem awesome at anything.  She can't DPS worth crap, and yet wears light armor and can be killed really easily.  My heavy wearing Guardian is squishy as hell.  Just seems all messed up.
---
&gt; Yes they were
---
Then tell me please. I want to know.
---
So like someone said in the other post this might have been added at the same time to hide viability?
---
It's so fucking annoying. Warclaw should be for mobility only. I had 4 peeps today just running on mounts while being hit. It's open pvp ffs
---
ESO has an action camera feel. I don't think it has GW2's depth in build making, but it is has a similar feel.
---
Ive also seen him doing branded shatterer multiple times 
---
Unsurprisingly, my desired names weren't taken.. consider my username. It's a franken mix of my real name with a name I used at 13 years old.
---
1) Its mostly up close, unless you go with renegade and use shortbow. Hammer is long ranged but its mostly used for spike dmg and heavy aoe cc. Mace skill 2 is very spammable but focuses on burning dmg that cant really stack as much burning stacks as other burning condi professions.
---
2) Not bad at all. The legend skills are actually quite strong and trait lines are as well. S/S can spike down a target very fast, including multiple targets at once. And tagging mobs with mace is very easy and can be fun.
---
3) Herald. I like boons, i like sharing them. Renegade can support as well but in a more different and offensive way.
---
4) An instant lvl 80 rev can be easy to understand as soon as you understand how legend switching and energy works. Unlike other professions where you have instant 20 utility skills and you have to learn them all and worry about which might be more useful and which ones are less, Revenant utility skills are sorted by legends.  
---
And you have a legend for dps, one for healing, another for condi, and another one for sustain, very simple. 
---
Revenant trait lines are also "categorized" not just for their role like with other professions but also with legends them selves. 
---
If you decide i want to be pure dps its very easy to figure out which weapons, utility skills and trait lines you should have equipped.
---
Learning what skills do, what traits do can be easy.
---
The only real hard thing to do is to understand energy,legend swapping, and how different traits and legends can interact with different legends and traits.
---
I'm missing a Necro, ranger, rev and bagslag so I'll take 3 please!
---
Agree. Hopefully Guild Wars 3 will do things better! 😀
---
Sort of; being dismounted knocks them down for a few seconds.
---
Great job!
---
I dont know how anyone except a direct employee with Knowledge of their contracts should answer that correctly 
---
You can get both xpacs on dlg gamer for 36 bucks. Best price around and they’re partnered so you know you’ll get a legit key. 
---
I just got into the game and bought the bundle. If you are gonna buy one for full price, you’re better off buying both on dlg. 
---
36 bucks isn’t much considering there isn’t a sub fee. So it’s like 2 months of wow. Just thought I’d let you know. 
---
FFXIV
---
Yeah dismounting them + Scorpion Wire-style pull would be pretty great. Superior Battle Maul doesn't have to dismount/CC people since Finishing Blow (which also finishes downed enemies) doesn't CC either.
---
Heeeell no. Go SPvP 
---
tengu playable race 
---
TERA or Vindictus, maybe
---
FFXIV definitely does not have dodging or any sort of useable Action Camera.
---
i think SAB will only give me a new daily and probably 2 more crimson weapons this year, i have nothing else to collect from it =\[
---
Hard to say. My screenshot from the post I linked was when Roller Beetle Races were in swing, and then the wall was only raised. 
---
Well... I am personally playing purly necromancer. But you have asked for optimization and efficiency.
---
Not at all necessary imo. Depending on how versatile with you’re binds and far away you wanna go from main position, you can bind everything comfortably without modifiers. 
---
Someone posted a keybind map for their dad yesterday, I think. That would give you a good idea on what their is to be bound skill wise and otherwise. 
---
Well their plan was apparently to add expansion level content through LS updates
---
Ah, his guild tag is "dapper".
---
Silver was on sale last week, don't think we'll see cooper this time around
---
Whenever I see the Zojja armor with the bra helmet all I can think of is Lilo and Stitch, [that scene were he wears a bra on his head.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/739c237d09138b564ee51f43024dcc61/tumblr_mm12i3M1Mo1qdikipo1_500.gif)
---
Hard to say when the wall itself got raised. Are there any patch notes that specify when it got added?
---
But do you have Three Golem Monte?
---
Any way to elaborate on that? I am not understanding the appeal.
---
The wiki says you save 0.5 copper per use, which seems like it'd take forever to pay off for 600 gems worth. That, and it's only a basic salvage kit which is the worst kind, so would it even be beneficial to use this in most situations?
---
It's better to purchase something you will use a lot. The LS episode you will play once or twice and then move on
---
I have one, not uncomfortable at all. Just need to find one that fits your hand. 
---
10 k ap reward iirc
---
I wish they made these tradable, or added them to the vendor.
---
As far as I know, [Shukov's Launch Codes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Recipe:_Shukov%27s_Launch_Codes) have never ever been available.
---
No, his CPU is actually poor for the game.
---
You can play the game without an MMO mouse. It's just easier if you have one. Especially if you play a class like mesmer that has more F skills or if you have small hands like I do and it's difficult to reach buttons. 
---
You could try and contact support and see if the'll return the materials you used to make the ascended versions. Otherwise it's just farming buried treasure really and like you said it's rare. 
---
Staff 1 and 5 are also fine.
---
600 per slot, down from the usual 800.
---
You just have to force yourself to use the buttons until they become a habit. It takes more effort but will be worth it long term. Skill clicking will really hold you back from becoming a better player. 
---
These two are awesome. Highly recommend, just beware the cash shop.
---
Dammit! I am away for the weekend :/
---
There's nothing like it, sadly.
---
I strongly recommend *not* using an 80-boost to make your first max-level character. It's not that you'll feel lost on revenant in particular; rather, you're going to be cheating yourself out of a lot of the skills you'll need in order to stay alive fighting level 80 mobs (particularly HoT because those are harder, but everything becomes a bit more difficult at 80 in general). There's not really any such thing as "staying ranged" in this game. Not every mob is going to let you do that, for one, and you're honestly limiting yourself severely if you're not willing to wade into the fray occasionally. On many classes you'll be restricting yourself to only one weaponset that may not be particularly "good" or efficient (if that matters to you, totally fine if it doesn't!) and restricting your abilities, as well.
---
That said, if you really want to play mostly ranged anyway, Revenant certainly can! Hammer is the ranged weapon on Rev, though while I like the flavor of it, I find it really slow and boring to use. Overall I really enjoy Rev -- I like the lore and the aesthetic and the playstyle (particularly condi Renegade, but power Herald is nice too).
---
Thief with guns is totally doable. Pistol/Pistol has a pretty satisfying burst, but it's very much a one-trick pony if you're not interested in swapping to a melee set as well. Basically you just spam Unload, and it gets boring pretty quickly for me -- however, swapping it up to another set when you get tired of kiting can help alleviate that. Its other weakness is that Unload is single-target, so you don't really have much cleave on that set and can get overwhelmed by multiple mobs quickly if you're not careful. It self-heals really well though with the right build, so it may be worth a try for you!
---
You also may want to consider longbow ranger. The damage is poor, comparitively-speaking, but it's more than enough for simple Open World content and is very surviveable if you take a bear pet.

Engineer can remain ranged easily using Rifle and Kits (grenade kit in particular), but it requires a lot more juggling and you won't really be playing rifle optimally if you try to stay entirely ranged, because Blunderbuss does its best damage at close range and Jump Shot does a lot more if you use it right on top of whatever you're fighting (so they take the damage from both the leap *and* the landing). It's a pretty dynamic playstyle, at least, and really great damage if you're willing to go Holosmith and go in close when in Photon Forge.
---
If you don't mind minions, Necro can be fun and stay mostly at range. You can play a minionmancer build as either a Reaper or Scourge (or even vanilla Necro if you don't get the expansions). Just take a staff and an axe/whateveroffhandyouwant with you. The axe isn't a max-range weapon, but it's ranged enough to keep you out of harm's way while your minions draw the aggro from you. As a bonus, I just think necro axe skills look really cool.
---
If you're willing to keep the mesmer, a *lot* of people play greatsword mesmers for ranged combat and enjoy them, too. Using a greatsword to shoot lasers? Very cool! I personally don't enjoy the playstyle of the greatsword though -- it feels slow and clunky to me. If you get the expansion you can also go condi mirage and just use staff/staff. Slap an energy sigil on both staffs to give yourself more dodges and then it's just max range murder while your clones take a lot of the damage for you and you dodge all day.. I have a staff/staff condi mesmer that I use for soloing difficult champions, dungeons, and fractals if I'm bored, and between staying at range and spamming dodges (mirage cloak), it almost never dies, even with the recent nerfs. Personally I find axe mirage more fun, but staff is certainly safer.
---
You can also play ranged on your guardian, if you decide to keep it and get Heart of Thorns. The Dragonhunter spec can use a longbow and, while not the best weapon or optimal playstyle, it's certainly totally viable for Open World and (personally speaking) a lot more fun than Longbow Ranger. Even without expansions, core guard can stay semi-ranged with scepter anyway, and many solid Guard/DH/Firebrand builds make use of a scepter in one if its weaponsets for that exact reason.

I dont me an to be that guy but I checked I do have it. Not sure when I got it but once upon a time I did lol.  I'm sure it is broken
---
Oh no the sales finally sniffed out its prey...  my wallet.
---
I got to level 80 with under 5 gold. Now I'll spend more than that on things to throw in the mystic toilet just for funs. 
---
There was also the 3 day headstart

Salvage is guaranteed funds. Mystic forge is a gamble. I'd just salvage everything unless I was feeling pretty rich. 
---
For mentor tags, you can't be in a squad but can lead an informal group. Type /mentor to activate if you have the mastery. 
---
I don't think they've written themselves into a corner at all. Even if Aurene does end up solving this for us, that doesn't mean she's going to solve everything for all time. We've solved plenty of problems up until now without her -- and by that I mean that just because she helped occasionally doesn't mean that she solved everything *for* us or that we didn't ultimately contribute more, and there have been plenty of steps along the way where she didn't help at all.
---
Be very careful what you define as "all" or "everything", because the fact that she might end up being the key to solving *the exact plot point that she was created to solve, and which the story has been leading up to her solving* doesn't mean all of our problems are going to magically go away.
---
Well anet better start working their asses off to put this game back togheter after sending people away from gw to work on side projects that got scrapped.
---
guild wars 2 is horribly optimized
---
Tl;Dr snowflake wants to feel special and like they've made a massive innovation, so they refuse to hold their idea up to public scrutiny but only talk where they can ignore critics.
---
Preventing people to feed into the zerg or to help cut off reinforcements to defend a tower/keep isn't a strategy anymore?
---
So post it. Let everyone see. Hiding it is just showing that you don't want criticism.
---
Post it. Let everyone see. Stop hiding from criticism.

So post it

It's, in my opinion, an aesthetically beautiful piece of shoddily implemented pay-to-win grindfest, but Black Desert Online has a responsive and mobile combat system that's fun to play. 
---
The game is still terrible, with enforced PvP, the worst kind of grind, a wide array of features that are all puddle-deep, blatant pay-to-win (and remember it has enforced PvP) and *terrible* writing, but the combat is fun and the game is beautiful.

The mist champions can be summoned in the strongold mode as support on the offensive lane - [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stronghold](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stronghold)
---
I have tried for almost a year to find something similar to guild wars 2 out there.
---
Tried countless mmorpg's out there, sadly NONE can compare.
---
And honestly, with all the p2w cash grab bullshit out there, I found a renewed gratitude to Guild Wars 2 for  putting together such a nice game with such amazing combat without any overly cash grab shit.
---
Compared to what is out there, trust me, we are blessed.
---
Some single player games do come close though, but they are single player :( :S
---
I bought a new slot like a week ago. Damn. 
---
yup. with most likely nothing new coming from SAB, its just doing 3 dailies each day to get the crimson assassin tokens.
---
It's really weird to me that people seem to think that a character's resurrection somehow erases all the grief and anger and fear that people feel when the person died.
---
I don't care if she comes back fifty times over -- while it may affect how upset I get if she were to die in the future, it will *never* take away all the pain I felt that first time it happened. 
---
And it certainly doesn't erase the trauma that it probably causes to Aurene herself, which stories like this often conveniently overlook. We take for granted that lots of other story events have a lasting effect on characters even if the event itself has passed -- why do we assume that actually *dying* only has a lasting effect if they stay dead? If Aurene was a human who got jumped, beaten, and robbed in an alley during the course of the plot, we'd still consider that an event that probably had a lasting impact on her character and possibly the overall plot even though she isn't spending the rest of her life being beaten up forever. But somehow her straight-up getting murdered is supposed to only qualify as plot and development if she stays dead forever?
---
I'm honestly not expecting ANet to acknowledge how life-changing an event it would be, on a personal level (after all, they haven't touched that with the commander yet, either), and *that's* the part I would have issue with, if it goes down that way. Not the fact that she died and came back, itself. Death is only cheapened if you view characters and their feelings as disposable and don't acknowledge the realistic mental and emotional fallout.
---
you are all acting like it is 100% impossible to demount ppl. that is simply not the case.
---
Wrong episode 1 released 2 months after PoF September to November. Episode 4 again wasn't delayed. Episode 5 I don't count as a delay just because it was released a week after Anet came back.

There are many many different circuits in your CPU that do different kinds of operations on binary numbers in a CPU, there's a circuit for adding two integers, one for substracting integers, one for multiplying integers and many others doing mathematical or logical operations on binary numbers or many other things.    
---
A program is nothing but a list of instructions that tell the processor which circuits to use with which numbers.  
---
But you don't only calculate with integers on a computers, you also need to calculate with numbers that have a decimal point.  
---
These are called floating point numbers and obviously can't be handled with the same way as integers, so you either need to build a floating point operation using multiple steps of integer math and logical operations (possible but obviously very slow) or you create dedicated circuits for doing operations on floats.  
---
That's what the FPU (=floating point unit) is, a collection of circuits that can do math with floating point numbers.
---
Some applications need a _lot_ of floating point calculations and require co-processors to do it for them.  
---
Your 1050 ti that handles the immense amount of floating point math needed for 3D graphics is such a co-processor with 768 "CUDA "cores"" which are basically FPUs.
---
For the microarchitecture of your CPU, AMD decided to have one integer unit per CPU core but have every 2 cores share one FPU; an FX-6300 has 6 Integer units and 3 FPUs.
---
The operating system has to decide which processor handles the instructions of which task but Windows doesn't seem to handle the shared FPUs of Bulldozer very well, so it might put two tasks that both require lots of floating point math on two cores that share an FPU while leaving one of the other FPUs in your system unused.  
---
To prevent this you can tell Windows to never put two threads of GW2 on a core pair that share an FPU which will cut the theoretical integer performance in half but the more efficiently used floating point performance might be enough to net better overall performance.  
---
There are multiple ways to do this, so it's best that you waddle a guide on Windows core affinity.
---
I haven't tested this myself but I remember seeing a post on this sub that someone had success on the 8-"core" variant of your CPU doing this, so it's worth a shot.  
---
Another option to get better performance would be to overclock your CPU, for that check out /r/overclocking/wiki and/or waddle an OC guide for your CPU architecture (guides from overclock.net are usually very good).

Finally got a group together to learn CM100 yesterday. Got Arkk to 5% on our best attempt. Of course slippery slope was one of the instabilities.

I have 2 lvl 80s just trying to boost my rev cuz i dont like map completion lol
---
Instant tagging at 1200 range is already good, and multiple clones using gs ambush can tag a ridiculous number of things.
---
Plat takes like 20 games on new account max lul
---
Can you fuck off with the 2-3 month cadence? This thing hasn't been true for a long period of time.
---
Attracting new players is always a hot topic but I don't think you will get it with adding even more features to the game that nobody seems to be hearing about.
---
ArenaNet relies heavily on word of mouth to get players to their game. They are not rolling the advertisement wheel with it so for many the game flies under the radar, had heard of it a few years back or even left it back then for whatever reason.
---
Many of those features you mentioned are great and work great for other games but what does this mean for GW2?
---
Popular features:
---
I don't know what is really that popular about them, sure they are popular in other games but because they are an integral part of the game. What would fishing bring to GW2 for example? I can only see it as another way to get crafting materials for the cooking profession. It would also be more like harvesting, mining or logging instead of a crafting profession on its own. Housing could be great but wouldn't that mean that players are more and more split into their own instances just to give them something to work on? This will also be something that needs to be continuously be expanded or players will get bored with it. There is, for example, not really a reason to go to the guild hall so what reason would be to go into your own house? You could put the services in them but why buy the unlimited passes then? Then you would want to have your harvesting nodes in them and the Home instance, which pretty much could be reworked into a housing system, would get forgotten other than new players and key farmers visiting them out of necessity and not because they want to.
---
New starting options:
---
Great idea but doesn't work with GW2. GW2s focus is the story. Any map you visit is frozen in a specific place in time and some even changed this time through the story like kessex hills and lions arch. Giving the players new starting areas would mean you would need to create for each level range a new map for the players to play in. This would be 7 maps just to get you to level 80 (1-15,15-25,30-40,40-50,50-60,60-70,70-80). And how exactly would you justify this with an expansion? Every expansion so far was level 80 content only with masteries. Your idea would take another piece out of the puzzle a new player has to find and understand. And how exactly would that fit into the story, you are an awakened and then fight Zhaitan?! Do you lock the personal story from those players? So it wouldn't just be a "small compromise", what examples you are talking about here? Revenant was a design decision which isn't comparable here.
---
New Races/Cultures:
---
This is probably more of a technical limitation or rather work intensive thing. A lot needs to be done to create a new race starting from their own personal story, countless voice acting lines need to be recorded again, rigging all of those gear pieces to the new race. They said that they needed around 9 months for a full armour set for all Races and genders, now multiply that to the number of gear pieces we have in the game. This would be a massive amount of work for very little benefit.
---
&gt; Make the Business Model Easier To Understand!
---
Though your idea reads as "Make the business model so that I might not pay anything at all". Season 4 Episode 1 released on November 28th 2017. That means it is ~1.5 years since it released. With your idea, you would deny ArenaNet 2 years of revenue by Making a full season free for everyone in that time period. That is not how you earn money.
---
Also, Free accounts unlock the living world episodes when they play the game at that time, they only need to own the expansion to be able to play it.
---
With those ideas you will push more into the gem store direction because how else would they get their money over those years? And I mean more than they already do.
---
I don't think any of your ideas will actually do what you think they will. All those things will not attract new players to the game when they don't hear about it somewhere or know how great the game is. And even with the Ads ArenaNet is putting out those are only really visible if you search for GW2 but then you are more likely to see it when you are already in it. If they would do more advertisement instead of us spreading the news then we would also see a lot more players joining the game. Because what do we really see here? Some Advertisement of Gaming websites or here on reddit (which, as I already stated, are more because of your browsing history), every other release there is also an interview or article about it from a single website. ArenaNet got more publicity from JP and the layoffs than from their releases.
---
i remember enjoying swtor before i returned to this game a few years, i looked back into it last week and gave it 30 minutes, then i came back to gw2. 
---
swtor feels clunky compared. when it comes to movement, my character was knee up jogging while walking at normal speed, turned me right off the game.
---
Am sorry, I am actually busy explaining to the people who asking me. I have no time to read stuff from not decent people.
---
eso combat is bearable once you get the hang of 'weaving', that is; using a basic attack inbetween every skill use; so like a magblade (magicka base nightblade) might initiate with a heavy attack (just hold down basic attack button for longer), queue whatever the aoe field is called and whilst in the animation of that you can pre charge your next staff attack so you get a half charged basic off
---
it was a bug, but people said it made combat better so now its a feature
---
... the thing i really dont like about ESO is lack of cooldowns (aside from ults); you dodged that nuke? hah no problem i have it again is 0 seconds
---
He didn't say high damage, he said instant, compared to e.g. Necro staff auto which takes a couple seconds to actually hit things at max range.
---
I haven't been able to relate to any of the gripes on mount. I'm almost exclusively a roamer.
---
Just today I played for 2 hours or so running around taking sentries and camps; there's only 2 instances of enemies ignoring me and running off on their mount. Besides that there was plenty of fighting for and between objectives.
---
I don't disagree on anything you said about what roaming is, and yet I just don't see what the problem is.
---
If anything the mount give non-thief/mesmers some speed to traverse long distances and increases the odds of people bumping into each other.
---
Ranger shortbow and longbow can both be traited to pierce, have aoe damage abilities, and rangers have traps which are great for several types of farming as well as decent mobility.
---
Aurene coming back because of Joko's power? Holy shit, how did no one think of this before? Oh wait... 
---
it still won't make a huge difference. you could go out and buy a 5 thousand dollar gaming PC and you would still get less than 60 FPS if there are more than 10 people on your screen or in any boss fight, in LA, PoF maps. the game just runs badly
---
its both, every 5 K AP you get one
---
That'd be race-ist
---
I only do t1 dailies as i dont really have a group to play with. Other then that just world content, bit of pvp.
---
wildstar... wait a minute... nevermind
---
Risky click of the day
---
I'm not personally too concerned about it  either way, but maybe debuff while in enemy territory that makes you take more damage while mounted - makes it easier to knock people off mounts and people have to be smart enough to dismount to avoid the knock down, and rely on their own class skills to escape/disengage.
---
*hate* charr?
---
how can anyone possibly *hate* charr? 
---
It's an impurrfect world.
---
Is it NSFW?
---
Sigh just bought one yesterday...
---
Full HD and yes, I checked that I'm using the GPU but I'll do it again. Drivers for the NVidia are up to date, but the BIOS driver is not (there is a common issue with thermal throttle after update). I'm using Intel Extreme Tuning Utility to check temperature and load, but also throttling. Since my last laptop had cooling problems, heat was the first thing I checked. 
---
Good point about the difference between a the performance of a laptop and a desktop, but my worries come from the fact that my last laptop (i7-3537U with GeForce GT730M) was not that far behind in performance. My new one works well, but it seems it should work a bit better. Maybe I'm just worried about nothing and it is working as well as it can.
---
I did.
---
For me the 502 would be way overkill. I don't want more than a 5 button mouse for any mmo.
---
TERA and Secret World Legends are the first mmo that came to my mind. Similar but not that similar.
---
Consider sword/focus, you'll get swiftness from the focus and it's a pull that can yoink people behind you backwards if you're being pursued. Use blink, and if you go Mirage (I usually go chrono to bring utility to my group but right now you're just trying to keep up) you'll have more blinks.
---
I run chrono sword/focus and GS, with a support type build. Mirage will help with closing gaps better, along with staying closer to the zerg. Utility is sacrificed but a lot of Mesmer players have gone Mirage.
---
I mean, if Aurene "solves" Kralkatorrik in a way that requires her to leave to the Mists, or fall into a slumber, or become an inanimate object, etc then that'll put a neat bow on her ability to bail the Commander out of everything.
---
Could also be that people reserved the names you wanted in GW1. Before release it was stated that names used in GW1 would be reserved in GW2 to give people a chance to keep their character names. Only by linking a GW1 account with a GW2 one could you use the names from that GW1 account. I think they did away with that system after a bit, but that could be a reason why so many names you wanted were taken at release.
---
They could make a meter-based boosed, i.e., playing during the week builds up a bonus meter, and playing during the weekend activates the bonus based on how much you played during the week.
---
What is it actually that you need to progress in the storyline? Maybe we can give you more direct help without you having to skip ahead to get a mount. 
---
Aesthetics
---
Does this usually yield good results? I have by most accounts a good PC and GW2 struggles for me too. 
---
By high tech you meant people driving in police cars taken out of clown show.
---
Season 4 isn't available on the gem store, at least it wasn't for me. They seem to be unlocked automatically once I'd beaten PoF story. I didn't have to buy them, unlike with seasons 2-3.
---
Don't forget Shadows and Shaders. Somehow, even being normally GPU bound stuff, the actuall GPU usage goes \*down\* because of the extra CPU usage they cause.
---
If you have them automatically, it just means you logged into the game when those episodes were available.  Active players get new episodes for free just by playing the game once during the episode's 2-3 month release window.
---
Not really. It "changes" GW2's render from DX9 to DX12. While it helps sometimes, the game's main bottleneck is logic, not render.
---
Hmm. I don't remember playing in 2017 but I guess I must have. 
---
Their arguments bore me. I slep
---
you need those heels to plant those fine paws on the ground [when you're sitting on the harvest chair!](https://i.imgur.com/DDpC55o.jpg)
---
I don't think you would've needed to play in 2017.  Episode 1/Istan should've launched in early 2018, with the subsequent episodes going forward from there.
---
What is your country and budget?
---
Sadly, I do not. Probably will be another year.
---
Less of a personal "problem" and more of a time saver, start the game and just close it anymore.
---
Mad Memoires TIL 
---
People who run never wanted to fight anyway.
---
If yu see people who wanna fight they will stop and fight. 
---
Anyone part of a WvW guild that does runs somewhere between 10AM-4PM Central Time? Doesn't matter to me if the guild is based in NA or EU, just looking for someone I can join during that time frame.
---
Yeah I don't understand why they have heel sole either, its not like charrs use them
---
And still...  [https://youtu.be/Hi72wXOb-yw](https://youtu.be/Hi72wXOb-yw)
---
Well find a friend to play with.
---
I love the game personally but the issue I have is being able to stay motivated to play it.
---
&gt; death has become extremely cheap
---
No, it just doesn't have the same meaning in Tyria as it does on Earth.
---
&gt; It will seem like they wrote in Aurene eating Joko to be a planned dues ex machina to allow them to kill her with no consequence
---
A) "planned deus ex machina" is an oxymoron - if it's set up previously in the story, it's not a Deus Ex Machina.
---
B) being dead forever isn't the only consequence of dying, especially as we already established in a setting where death doesn't mean the same thing as it does on Earth.
---
&gt; cheapens an amazing villain like Joko to just being a plot device and doesn't do him justice
---
The bad guys don't need to be done justice. They're bad guys. Justice is what is done to them. Making them into a laughingstock or a dragon meal *is* doing justice to them.
---
I'm 100% with you on the Ascension thing, though. I honestly think that what Aurene and Glint discussed in private last episode was the possible necessity of her death to continue the war in the Mists. I don't think her body coming back to life is where the story is going, and her eating Joko was just that - the way we got rid of Joko.
---
When it's done.
---
Amazing
---
Finally
---
tpotHehe No it should be in fractals tpotHehe
---
&gt; why do we assume that actually dying only has a lasting effect if they stay dead?
---
Because a lot of people don't think trauma is as big of a deal as physical injury. If you can heal from being dead, you never actually died, don't you know.
---
The searing?
---
dammit 
---
Me too, I feel your pain :(
---
Couldn't say it better myself. If I only come back to the game once every 3 months for an update why bother spending money on it? (though I did make me a few legendaries these last few months old content only keeps my attention for like 1-5 hours a week.)
---
Did this one once with ppl who were better than me. How did they ? They claimed having a big TV. No achievement, bugged. Then anet fixed it. After a while, also found ppl who were better than me. Also had a big TV (not the same). Alas, still bugged. Anet fixed it *again*. No more big TV people around. I tried twice, failed, and quit because this crap is not worth it especially with a ridiculous 1AP tied to it, and unnecessary long wait between events (even if you roam all 3 spawn points) ... why didn't they make it triggerable with a permanent npc ?
---
&gt; What is the play style? Is it up close or ranged?
---
In case you haven't noticed all classes have both melee and ranged options. That said, I don't think revenant's ranged weapons find much use anywhere outside WvW.   
---
&gt; How bad was the leveling process?(mesmer is absolutely grueling imo)
---
Mesmer is not much harder than any other class though, you just need to have a general understanding of combat/core gameplay mechanics. However, revenant's hammer isn't any better for leveling, and probably is worse than mesmer's ranged options.   
---
&gt; If I decided to purchase an expansion pack, it would come with a level 80 boost. If I boosted a Revenant to 80, would I feel incredibly lost and regret not having leveled it for the sake of hours played?
---
The game does not differ significantly at level 1 and level 80. Except the mobs are all vastly more difficult in expansion zones. Anyways, you would have been just as lost at level 80 after leveling up manually, the leveling experience teaches you absolutely nothing about how key stuff works. You aren't losing much either way.   
---
&gt; On a side note - is a thief with guns pretty doable?   
---
What do you mean by "pretty doable"? It's serviceable for solo PVE - but so is almost everything, so that isn't a high bar to clear. I don't think those weapons are used in any kind of competitive content though.   
---
Yeah because current mmos aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. People just switch mmo. It is very active.
---
I don't remember this one :o
---
I kinda agree.
---
But at the same time, roamers like thieves, mesmers and that old troll ranger build had it too easy for too long too.
---
If I was ever using a Zerg build and got caught by a roamer and I actually started winning, they would 100% escape from me and there is nothing I could do to stop them.
---
They’d then come back after cool downs and try again.
---
So I won the fight and they come straight back at me.
---
Roaming was never fair. Roamers would escape from the fight all the time. Now the zergling can escape it’s such an issue.
---
I expect the storyline to continue with The Commander deep in depression because they basically sent a child to slaughter. 
---
"Our children will tell stories of what we did today!"... True, but not like we  expected those stories to be told... more like a cautionary tale. 
---
Its free so you don’t lose anything except time. Depend on how worth you time is. If you have less than 4 hrs a day for leisure activities, I would say not worth it.
---
oh upgrade to 500? that would be immensely useful
---
and if a returning player has some chapters of living world and not others , it's a huge problem?
---
Raises my highest FPS by a ton and my lowest as well.  
---
I'd rather have 40 as my lowest instead of 25.
---
I just find it very rude. It's like people handing out flyers on the street. I am fine with that but this is the equivalent of running up to you and shoving the flyer into your face.
---
I like how many fan/community related easter eggs the game has, but I agree; there surely should be *something* for that recognition but I'm not sure this is the right thing.
---
Normally i would agree with you, but when you have an ascalonian named Dulfy, we might as well.
---
Very 
---
Its a call to subscibe to flyingkitty on youtube
---
You, I like.
---
Try doing it while looking at the screen from the top down, rather than at an angle.
---
its like asking if i got my bestfriends girlfriend pregnant. i will only know once its out. 
---
70 is the hard number of character slots without needing to have the maximum number of character slots before purchasing the Deluxe or Ultimate edition of Heart of Thorns. 
---
I got to 70 character slots after getting HoT.
---
I would recommend Anydesk.
---
It's a remote desktop app.
---
Pros:
---
Free.
---
No need to pair devices before usage. Just note down each computer's unique ID and remember your password. When i need to log in, I just get someone at home to switch on my computer and we're good to go.
---
Very clean interface. 
---
Lag is minimal for me. Audio + visual. I stream downloaded movies from my desktop onto my phone. 
---
Available on android. Never tried but you can definitely collect dalies with my phone / access bltc.
---
Yep. The wife and I just hit 32 slots each. We're going to "try" to avoid making anything more than key Farmers until the next living story is announced in case it effects character creation at all like PoF did but it's so easy to make more after playing so long. 
---
How about they rename one of the junk items found in Elonian reward tracks to "Mighty Teapot"?
---
The true Endgame. I need them all to look dope.
---
69 + 2 hidden beta char slots
---
Finally.
---
Because they tried to inject a bit of impartiality in a "GW2 is a special unique game" circle jerk. But FFXIV is probably even more static than something like WoW. They try to put some movement in with most of the melee classes with positional attacks (rear or flank), but it doesn't do much to change up the old-school gameplay. I love both games equally, but for very different reasons.
---
Yeah I mainly roam and play sPvP. Coming around to dwarf and hammer for large groups though.
---
No, but there's always next March :&gt;
---
100% agreed, and done the same search. Closest wad black desert online. Now if you wanna play single player game , try darksouls remasterd, incredibly satisfying game. 
---
&gt;No, it just doesn't have the same meaning in Tyria as it does on Earth.
