Not me but happened to a fellow guild mate in WvW (few years back).

Had a decent sized squad of 40 since he was the only pugmander on the map and these pugs just wanted ktrain babyland time or were off with the fairies and wanted to tunnel vision on something, anything. Anyway everything was going fine so long as there was a tag on the map - the other 2 sides were mostly poking each other with sticks in smc. We decide we wanna AJ one side since we had the numbers, didn't matter which we just wanted bags.
---
Shortly after we leave our 3rd this random guy tags up... except he chooses the same color as our com, even hovering around him and purposely moving in front to confuse the rest of our squad. Dude kept floating around pulling pugs off the main tag in which by the time we trickled in to inner the other 2 servers noticed, pulled apart and split around inner smc. Our tag did a 180 getting the f outta there but for some unholy reason the other tag ran head on into one of the enemy zergs taking half our squad out with him.
---
Things started to get awry in map chat, people were blaming the main tag for "not pushing" despite being pitted up against 2 other zergs in an unwinnable situation all because some troll wasted time + split the zerg beforehand. This went on for a good hour; we lost people our squad was down to 15 and this guy kept leading pugs to their deaths. It wasn't long before the other 2 sides wanted to take the fight to our 3rd and basically double teamed us for ages. Map chat by then was a dumpster fire. The damage was done. Literally unsalvageable after that point.

---
&gt;Very odd, they normally do
---
Not 'normally,' no.  It's always been a bit of a crapshoot.  Or I always get new CS reps.
---
It's pretty much up to the luck of the draw whether or not a rep wants to.  And that goes for service and escalation.
---
Don't be surprised if they tell you to go pound sand, OP.  I hope they don't, you're absolutely deserving of replacements.
---
that's why you gotta get 'em fixed

Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

---
I like how you wrote the names of the human and dwarf legends because you knew writing Ventari and then centaur would weaken your point.
---
I agree Ventari is a legend primarily of the sylvari race but I don't think he weakens the argument for a sylvari legend simply because he's not a sylvari.
---
Sylvari are so young that the only person who is really worth of a rev legendary status is Trahearne. I don't think even Scarlet was as well known as the founder of the Pact, the first ever sylvari and the guy who was so diplomatically connected even the largos knew of him.
---
Scarlet was mostly a mystery to the average Tyrian right up until she attacked LA.
---
Ah whoops I skimmed over that part, thanks.
---
Really?
---
Affirmative action is discrimination against white men and that was my point.
---
You just proved that people don't care about that again proving my other points.
---
I like the idea, but don't want new Legends at all. I want a game changer. I want revenants to summon the pure power of the mists itself.
---
Hey guys, so I recently came back to GW2 (haven't played it since 2014 for various reasons lol) and am currently enjoying the story I missed plus the new specializations. Especially on my Asura Warrior (I forgot how much fun it is to be a badass shortie lol).
---
I've been playing around with the Berserker and Spellbreaker, and found that I can't really get a feel on either when it comes to ranged weapons. I always like to have a set of melee weapons and a second swap for ranged, but I can't really figure out what ranged weapons are good for either. This is for general PVE, I'm not looking for any meta builds or anything.
---
For Berserker, Rifle seems alright, but since most of the Rages are close range Skills, it feels like I'm missing some utility. For Spellbreaker, again with Rifle, it feels very clunky since Burst Skills are limited to level 1 and level 1 Rifle Burst kinda sucks in terms of damage vs cast time.
---
Longbow is an option, but I really dislike the Tactics Trait line for open world since most of the stuff there is for reviving allies, which isn't exactly something I need to worry about solo.
---
Do I just have to accept my ranged options aren't that good, or is there something I'm missing?
---
As a side note, I generally go for Mace/Mace + Rifle as Berserker, and Dagger/Dagger + Rifle/GS as Spellbreaker, and Core Warrior uses Sword/Mace + Rifle (no Ascended Axe yet, and I keep Mace since I have the Moot, might as well use it lol).
---
~~Also as another aside, has there been changes to the salvaging system I wasn't aware of? I have a Mystic Salvage Kit that says it's supposed to have an 80% chance to salvage upgrades, but every time I've used it it never gives me Sigils or Runes lol...~~
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Both GW2Launcher and LaunchBuddy simply close the handle in a similar way to handle.exe. Using one over the others won’t alleviate the problem.
---
The only difference is that handle.exe is much more manual a solution.
---
I think it's time they take the next expansion to some place new and use the rev legend from a distant land (Cantha works) and build up the lore of both that rev legend and the land it comes from. Revenant legends should be easy story telling home runs and the choice of Kalla for Elona's expansion was a massive face plant on ANet's part.
---
Ignore him. He’s rather trolly when it comes to multi boxing. In his mind it’s impossible to have a legitimate use for more than one account being online at a time.
---
I could be wrong but he may even be the one that suggested sharing resources between multiple accounts should also result in a ban. Though I’m not 100% sure and may be incorrect.
---
&gt;That took place in the real world not a fantasy world that has no effect on the real world or its politics.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If you want to make real world change, keep it in the real world, this is just a vanity project and painting targets on peoples backs.
---
Except we absolutely do have an impact, as it says in the post we are fundraising for a real life charity, and we have fundraised for other important causes in the past.
---
Also, having done this event for years now, I can say that even just the in-game component is very important to a lot of people. Many connect from countries, regions, or just families, where they cannot be out, and have to live in the closet because they're afraid for their lives. Many find this to be the first time they talk to someone else who is like them, in an environment where they feel safe already.
---
And again, we never get comments like this on our cancer or multiple sclerosis fundraisers, just this one. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand why that is.
---
&gt;I see people as people in game, suddenly I see some as "Gay" or "Former male to female" instead of "Hey a cool person".
---
I didn't know the three were mutually exclusive, but I guess that says more about you than it does about them.
---
I already said this whole thing paints targets ands in one reason to stop it but nobody seems to give a fuck but then you all talk about how people want to hurt you.
---
It's like you agree but how dare I say I say stop the special treatment
---
When we get Polymock arena.
---
I never knew I needing insulting asura voices on a rev until now, omg
---
I don't like the breast cancer stuff either because it's sexual discrimination, I bitch about it offline too.
---
Doesn't say shit about me, I get told by LGBT activists n shit they want to be treated the same and not have their LGBT status have an effect on how they treated but then attack those who do just that.
---
How is treating you like people such a bad thing?? So desperate to play the victim you act people on your side, that isn't me, that's you lot.
---
It was proper housing before they added the decay timer.
---
Most people use scholar runes for the standard zerker builds in PvE, but check metabattle to be sure, there is probably niche other runes.
---
And Mina's Target Shooting.
---
Pretty sure they will want to avoid more than anything that caudecus out of bounds boss fight area with the faces and the cealing cat , I think even a dev was commenting on the discovery giving him trouble w his boss
---
And yet, when we do our cancer &amp; multiple sclerosis fundraisers, we get nothing but love &amp; support, even though cancer and an MS diagnosis are never fun, they are always a bad thing. Multiple sclerosis does not have a cure, and we talk about serious things, like how it presents, and the fact that many people who get sick from it are not taken seriously. We get messages of support &amp; thanks for spreading information about such a poorly understood condition.
---
Conversely, being queer is not a bad thing at all, and the event is a party and a day of love and celebration. We listen to music and have tons of fun making rainbows and just in general being silly and harmless.
---
So if "people play video games to get away from real life" was the main reason people were reacting negatively, then proportionally, we would get way more negative reactions to the other two fundraisers, which are about way more serious and dark real life things, but we don't.
---
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why.
---
I like her for everything PvE, but not for pvp/wvw.  With shortbow + Kalla the kite potential is really amazing while doing great damage and the playstyle kind of feels somewhat similarly to Rit in GW1, which is nice as someone who used to play it back in the day.  I can understand why some people don't love her, though, since outside of pve her current design does have some problems that they haven't addressed yet
---
Thanks for the very interesting quotes. I hope mouse child well.
---
I think it would be much more interesting if the legend was Svanir. We could hear things from his point of view.
---
Doesn't every class have such a movement skill?
---
not for the gold value no, but if you like to collect things it is a pretty cool goal to go for.
---
I understand but like anything else, always take opinions with a grain of salt. :)
---
Please no.  Give us actually interesting characters (preferably more villains as well) like:
---
Vizier Khilbron (undead lich)
---
Svanir
---
Master Togo
---
Razah
---
Varesh Ossa
---
Aesgir Dragonrender
---
I'd be fine with elite specs that don't introduce new weapons but gave you a new skill set for an existing weapon set they can use. Like a more direct damage oriented skillet for pistol(s) on engi.
---
Craftings not the best way to earn by far but things you could look at are tradeable items that require charged quartz crystals. You would of course need to make sure you are crafting the charged quartz daily so you have a supply ready
---
omg so lucky! Can I have it?

This looks so good, that it's not a fair fight.

&gt; I could be wrong but he may even be the one that suggested sharing resources between multiple accounts should also result in a ban. Though I’m not 100% sure and may be incorrect.
---
maybe provide a quote first before making wild accusations.
---
&gt;Western nations having gay pride events does nothing for those in Africa or Asia where its illegal, the only thing you are celebrating is your differences.
---
Well lucky for us, Guild Wars 2 is a game played all over the world, and every year we get people attending from countries where it is illegal to be gay, or where trans people's rights are in danger (like the USA for example). Many might also live in countries where it's otherwise legal to be gay, but it would be dangerous for them to be out, either because their job would be at risk, or they would be thrown from their homes. In the USA, 40% of homeless youth are LGBT.
---
On EU servers specifically, a huge amount of players come from countries where we still do not have equal rights, and many European countries have actually recently passed laws with the aim of preventing us from ever having them. There are many "Western" countries where gay people still face discrimination, and hate crimes happen pretty much everywhere.
---
And, as it says in the post, a big part of this event is actually a fundraiser that helps LGBTQ+ people flee state-sponsored persecution and violence, from places such as Chechnya, Syria, Barbados, etc.
---
Overuse of ^^ is also super german.
---
how does it compare to aquisitions incorporated, only D&amp;D related thing ive seen :P, same type of thing?
---
lol whatever you there my dude
---
Oh my god wait! I had a guy last week who asked me to do something with him and I couldn’t because I was helping a friend out in the game and he got super upset with me when I rejected his offer and I was just sitting there so confused as to what just happened. Literally never talked to this guy before. So bizarre. He didn’t ask me any weird personal questions though. Just stuff about the game and builds and such.
---
Nope, never heard race for life?
---
Indecent Banana XD
---
Awesome
---
The dwarves aren't unplayable because they're made of stone, they're unplayable because Anet wanted to set GW2 apart from the competing Warcraft franchise by not using stereotypical fantasy races.
---
I remember going to help someone do a HP in Highlands and then after they said "Oh can you not come help us do this mastery point as well? You aren't busy." and I'm like yeah sure okay, it's nearby and I was on my mesmer, no problem.
---
Then they ask again. And again. And again. Finally I just said, sorry I have to go and they said I was rude and should of stayed to help. didn't even thank me, meanwhile last night I gave away like 60 curios to a friend and he showered me with praise.
---
Gold value wise , it is much too much gold to be actually profitable. The main reason to have it is it's shareable. So it's not benefitting you , so much as other people. Cause you could just catch a ride into someone else's.
---
Ah, I see. Yeah, I currently am running just Berserkers armor so that wouldn't work as well for me. I'll just stick with rifle then lol.
---
Which is perfectly within the rules you yourself linked, as well as what the dev said.
---
The only problem comes if you’re setting them to auto attack and leaving them. They are all attended, they are all just not being played to the best of your ability. 
---
Otherwise your claim also applies to people watching tv and half paying attention to the game client, absently hitting skills.
---
You using a level 78 weapon. Is this intentional? Like, is this just an open world rifle?
---
Gay is clearly the new meta build ^(/s)
---
This shit is getting circular fast.

I actually had already done Junundu Rising. I had some guild stuff to attend to.
---
I really liked your elementalist and mesmer archetypes for the fighter, I think you managed to do interesting and quite balanced classes with them - and except for a couple of things, also simple and effective mechanics-wise.
---
This one though, it feels too complicated, both because of the way you write the mechanics (as in, you could take a bit more time in writing them, so that they are easier to understand) and because of the mechanics themselves. If I were you, I'd keep looking for a way to recreate the feeling of the reaper in D&amp;D, because I think this one is unnecessarily complicated and unintuitive the way it is right now.
---
In particular, I'd remove any mention (and any need) of CR and anything similar.
---
The path also feels quite overpowered: it gets spells (I'm not completely sure the barbarian should have a path providing spells, but that's beside the point), and they alone are quite strong, and then it also gets a significant boost to damage and a lot of strong features.
---
If I were you, I'd probably completely remove the spells (maybe provide only a thematic few that can only be used once or twice before a long rest) and reword or change many of the limitations you put to balance him - I get that in order to balance his strength you gave him several limitations (like, for example, receiving necrotic damage in order to allow him to add rage damage on cantrips), but I think it would be better and "cleaner" to nerf his strength (a lot) and also remove the limitations (in the previous example, simply remove both the rage damage from the cantrips and the self-inflicted damage).
---
These are all my opinions, and my intention is to give you a constructive feedback, so don't take my criticism badly. I hope my comment will help you.
---
i think doing the plate puzzle gives 5 or so in the final chests as well
---
I had hoped it was both
---
Is that Jak?
---
I don't really like the idea of putting characters that died in GW2 as an elite spec because I mean... That is kinda like a spoiler for those who just started the game...
---
Ty!
---
&gt; I’d say the game encourages it since cosmetic items dominate the bulk of the game’s content
---
Encourages, sure.  But it isn't the focus.  It's a fashion friendly game.
---
Just tested a few of the non-Heroes Guild Banners.  I put 5 of them down in a WvW borderland.  Attempting to place a 6th gave the message: "Too many spawns of this type nearby".  Played on the map for a bit, left for real life, came back 5 hours later -- they are still there.
---
My experience was the other way around. Maybe not quite so much. O got into the discord  and was asking looking for someone to sell me the expansion for in game gold. Yes. I knew it was against the rules and such but I did love in a poor country. But I was not trying to get anything for free and was giving gold in exchange. So! This lady pm me asking questions I was willing to answer mainly to give some info on my country situation how was life here and such. And mind me. I never ask anything for free and she gave a code for PoF. She made me so so so happy.
---
There’s min max with infusions also and a lot of masteries to get

Karka hunt rifle skin should have been an additional reward for completing the minigame, tbh.

Maybe *you* have to.

This is what Aurora and Vision was suppose to be. Instead of floating balls, make it so that one accessory has flowers bloom and 2 has constant flowers then a trail. It makes much more sense and much less gaudy than what we have now.

How about using a harpoon gun like a crossbow with the bolts/harpoons being the swap-able ammo you've described?
---
I'm just looking for reasons to bring weapons like the spear out of the underwater combat section of the game. XD
---
Cries in core guard
---
Happens pretty often. I saw one commander yelling "REDBULL GIVES ME WIIIINGS" as he jumped to his (our) death.
---
Not me, but was roaming in EBG one day on TC as there was no tag.  A person tagged up, who obviously hadn’t commanded before.  I run past the tower nearest our keep and see the squad standing outside with catas hitting the wall.  This would have been fine but it already belonged to our server.
---
So not only did the comm try to cap something we owned, but the squad had built 3 catas, were hitting the wall for no damage and everyone was standing there waiting.
---
I walked up and asked in say “you know we already capped this right?” Comm acknowledged their mistake  and said they felt stupid.  The way they responded was humble and I actually felt bad for them.
---
Good news is the person didn’t give up trying to command and got much better over time.  Every time I say them commanding after that I was rooting for them to do a good job.
---
Hi, I started GW2 today and got some questions regarding endgame builds.
---
Even though I'm new and far away from the endgame, I started working on a perfect final build since I don't like playing without a certain goal...
---
My question is: Is there a right build?
---
I read through all the abilities, effects, specializations etc. for my class with build editors and I do believe that I can create a working build, but it's hard to judge if you have no clue about the game. 
---
Is my custom build going to work or should I just copy one of the best rated builds from websites since they are unbeatable?
---
It's actually a question which relates to how balanced the game is; how much variety the game actually allows.
---
Thanks for your help in advance
---
It's not slower, it just seems like you get given less new options in that range. You get specialisations 2 and 3, you get a few more maps, and you get most of the dungeons. It seems pretty small compared to what the game gives you in the first 35 levels and then at level 80.
---
[https://youtu.be/FU1JUwPqzQY?t=95](https://youtu.be/FU1JUwPqzQY?t=95)
---
That was the selling point but it has change over time.
---
If it was an outfit would be easier i think. But yeah they need to do it for other races like they did with the other ones
---
At least it revives you without having to run back.  Nothing to really be upset about.
---
I remember giving someone that I hardly knew a ride once and during the drive he starts talking about how he needs a ride to work every morning and asking if I can pick him up and stop at McDonalds on the way to work. Some people just see someone doing them a favor as a signal that they can be manipulated.
---
I mean this as honestly as possible and trying not to say this as an insult but your opinion is part of the problem.
---
I was extremely disappointed in the lack of the Dragonsblood Spear being an actual weapon skin. We even had two for a Dragonsblood and Heroic Dragonsblood skins! Could have just used the staff and rifle for trident and harpoongun like so many other sets too.
---
I wish Junundu Rising was safer, but something like half of the time when I've tried to do it since the patch, it was bugged. The box telling you the status of the meta was completely gone (even when going near the 2 forts) and the NPC conversation that kicks off the collection never happened.
---
Ironically I decided to do JR due to Demolitionist Folke falling into a mountain the first time I tried Maw after the patch. I ran into JR not starting enough that I went back to Maw and haven't had a problem since.

No one is shoving anything down your throat. 
---
Is someone forcing you to come to this thread and comment? Is someone forcing you to go for the parade? Is someone robbing you and demanding you give all of your money to gay people? Is someone forcibly trying to convert you to being gay?
---
You literally come to a thread about the very people you hate for no reason, and then complain about there being a gay presence in this thread, *no shit*.
---
I've been keeping my eye out on there. Thanks though :)
---
sex-positivity is the way to go ;D👉
---
I second the suggestions of reaper and herald.  Warrior is fine if you use axe/axe, but greatsword 3 is an important skill on a short cool down that requires directional aiming.  Reaper is effortless.  If you haven't tried it, you most definitely should.  I can even play reaper reasonably with no mouse (keyboard only), something I can't say about any other class.
---
Not only are Sylvari in the Domain of the Lost, as you and others have said, there are Sylvari Mist Wardens in Dragonfall.
---
Is that what you call a Warrior wielding a sausage greatsword doing the "whirlwind attack"
---
Oh it's the same dude?
---
He also sent me a PM calling me a "white cuntknight" (in all caps) and "defending censorship" blah blah... the message appears to have vanished from my inbox after I reported it, but I wouldn't be surprised if others got similar PMs.

Guy is soooooo pressed. 💁
---
I would love to see new 5 man dungeons (like the core dungeons) in POF and HoT with new armour and weapon sets tied to them. 
---
I'm sure there are heaps of potential side stories from the new areas we've gotten since core that could be told in this format.
---
Hope I can make it this year, it looks like a bunch of fun!!
---
They've already confirmed the next plot won't be a "world ending" plot, so it likely will be a breather before more dragons.
---
That said, I don't expect it to last very long. ArenaNet doesn't seem to enjoy their non-Elder Dragon plots (Joko and Lazarus being abysmally short and unworthy plots).
---
The Elder Dragons don't actually sleep for 10,000 years. 10,000 years is their combined "awake and sleeping" cycle, best we can tell.
---
That said, the latter: Balthazar merely drained to the point where their magic was roughly the same as when they woke up, and wounded them into a comatose state.
---
On top of that, their cycles don't *have* to last 10,000 years - when they go to sleep, they leave one of their champions to function as a "herald" (such as Drakkar and the Great Destroyer); when magic is high in the world again, the Herald wakes up and begins creating minions and gathering magic to help the Elder Dragons wake up.
---
This means that Primordus and Jormag can wake up at any moment, given that magic is **very** high in the world, and the two Elder Dragons have hundreds if not thousands of minions and champions in the world to gather magic for them.
---
Fun fact: In retrospect, the description given to Primordus and Jormag are almost perfect mirrors to Kralkatorrik's state at the end of the Dragonfall meta. Primordus sunk into the lava, Jormag encased himself in ice, and Kralkatorrik cocooned himself in crystal when they were heavily injured and drained of magic.
---
Have a quote on what percentage is considered active? Obviously 50% is fine, but what’s the line? 33%? 25%? Unless you can show me a dev answer to this you’re just speculating. 
---
You know what they say about making assumptions...
---
You're literally proving their point by being a toxic little shit to them. I guess they should turn off Reddit replies as well by your logic so they don't have to read replies like yours.
---
I'd die for a harpoon gun with CC and grapple-pull abilities.
---
They are, very often, *much* better that way. Sometimes not, but mostly they are.
---
I love that you call me homophobic based on the fact I don't agree with gay pride parades and nothing else. 
---
What you are doing is hiding, you see an opinion that doesn't match yours, you can't stand it so you give it a label. 
---
I don't know if you are LGBT or not and guess what? You have no idea if someone with my opinion is LGBT or not either. 
---
But instead of discussing you decide to attack and discredit. 
---
Pretty sure anyone who likes discrimination are the ones who do that.
---
Never seen such a meme.
---
Your comment looks pretty triggered to me, tbqfh.
---
Hands down the most confusing map in the game in my opinion.
---
The difference is quite big in a good chunk of cases. Which is why many people from my country go live there. Still, doesn't mean that anyone has any obligation to buy a game or pay anything to anyone because of it. As someone who never had money to buy stuff from games because of the current economy and still struggles nowadays, it still makes me furious to see people like this one acting like people own them stuff. If you are gifted by someone, it should be because: 1- that person can gift you. 2- that person wants to. 3- that you deserve it. All of the 3 together and not because some spoiled person begged for it.
---
Your first sentence explicitly suggests we march for left handed people in current times though, which equates left handed people with lgbt people in the current context.
---
It's not really gambling if you can heal and buff one of the choya to rig the game.
---
I am talking about the difference between putting in winter's veil, and having a Christmas event, focused on telling the story of the life and deeds of literally Jesus Christ. I may be a Christian, but that would kill immersion for me, due to drawing attention to the real world. Additionally, a pride event in Tyria would be inconsistent with lore, I mean, the LGBT+ characters in the game feel like they are a natural part of the world, and face no negativity for their LGBT+ness (admittedly, I am genuinely concerned about the replacement rate in kourna, but I can also justify the high level of LGBT+ there with the advent of immortality, so it isn't a deal breaker that literally everyone in Kourna doesn't care about babies). So, a giant world wide event to make a commonplace thing seem commonplace doesn't make sense and would ruin immersion for me. 
---
On the other hand, I wholeheartedly support the player base taking part in activism in game. It is a great way to reach people one on one, and that is how you change the world. I also do not mind ANET supporting it, at all. So long as they don't try to reshape the world to do so (or God forbid give out boxes of loot or make Sigils of Nullification increase in price by 7million% to get a new rainbow infusion, that would upset me lol)
---
TL:DR doesn't mess with my role playing, and also goes about changing the world in the correct way, so A+!
---
Jumping on the victim train? You do realise those things are very literally happening across the globe?

Raids are something they did right, something ANET needs to learn from. They have a normal difficulty for casuals who don't care about going crazy with maxing and they have super hard difficulty for people to push themselves on with no huge benefit reward wise other than beating it. (You still get slightly better gear, but to a 10-50 gear score difference does not mean anything at the casual level anyway)
---
Builds tend to hinge on the Engineer elite specs, Scrapper and Holosmith.
---
Scrappers are top notch healers, unparalleled condition removers, but they're bad at boon spreading. They're very tanky, but the tanking role is typically handled by Chronomancers who both tank and provide boons.
---
Holosmiths deal decent damage and provide excellent Crowd Control. Power builds are easier to play and deal much of their damage in a burst, but deal less damage per second than condition damage builds.
---
You'll probably want to make a power Holosmith if this is your first character. While you're still leveling up, I'd recommend running gear that gives you extra power, precision and ferocity, and try to get used to the Bomb Kit and Grenade Kit; they'll be your bread and butter later.
---
*please*!
---
I'd love to wear the wizard hat or top hat for character cosplays (or just in general!), but I can't if it makes my character bald!
---
 Yeah, Shiverpeak is really pretty too. I have a note written reminding myself to mapbreak timberland falls it is sooooo nice there.
---
and I have.... maybe 10 of each of those after how many months of salvaging?
---
I have only done JPs a few times, but when I get up there I announce that they can port via "Teleport to Friend" if they need it (Aurora, Skyscale, etc.)
---
I don't ask for tips, but if people do tip, I'll accept whatever it is.
---
One of the main comms from my wvw guild still does that. Sometimes as a meme, sometimes unintended.
---
Well at least you tried;
---
I had someone who run Dragonfall who wasn't even pinging the Waypoint we were moving to, nor in /say, /map, /squad or /party; it was purely a selfish rush to get the exp as fast as possible, and like 75% if not 85% of the squad was lost, yet the commander and the lieutenant didn't even bat an eye at it.  
---
Ended up the lost squad to move map xD
---
&gt; The rest stands.
---
So where did I say that its impossible to have a legitimate use for more than one account being online at a time? 
---
It just becomes tricky, when you start gaining rewards without active gameplay.
---
Nothing wrong with loading up 9 different accounts with alts parked at jp chests for example, as long as you open each chest on each account individually.
---
Yikes. With the over all amount of kind folk in the GW2 community, I hate to see these entitled little shits pop up. I'd hate to think this kind of poor behavior from someone resulting in future negativity. I feel bad for your guildie.
---
Funny story, friend mesmer was helping me with some mastery points in POF and a random was nearby doing the same. Friend invited said player to party to give a free ride to the mastery point. The nice man tipped 5g to my friend before even reaching the mastery point, but we was having a hard time trying to get up to open the portal and was laughing at the fails on discord. After a few minute passes the said player sighed in party chat and said, you just took my 5g and i called my friend a thief. Friend ended up opening the portal and returning the 5g.
---
It would be too fun to gamble on Choya. Just imagining swarms of players huddled around this pit rooting for their little cactus to come out on top would be intense. Maybe even have certain pits with buy-in's, like 20g pits all the way up to 1,000g (I'm rich, you know) pits. 
---
I am always in favor of adding activities that can produce income for the player with limited engagment but maximum entertainment and player interaction. I can see the speech bubbles popping off now, all the praises of victory and bouts of profanity. All in all, I'd love for more ways to interact with other players without feeling like I am not achieving something tangible.
---
They'll be hearing from the guild's HR department.
---
I had the forged meta randomly stall as well, so it seems like they didn't review any of the older PoF meta bug reports before sending a horde to them.
---
pop bond to refill it
---
Thank you for this, I've been curious too.
---
Out of curiosity, is there any change for the Crystal Sands projectiles with it?
---
I'd be surprised if all dragons are addressed in the lifespan of this game. Maybe if there's a gw3...
---
Also true! Worth noting (for those not in the know): 
---
You trade off your Accessory slots for a backpack this way and have to use 1 sub-optimal (non Attuned&amp;Infused) ring to workaround the Unique tag (which Mist items do not have), also you have to eat the extra cost of Infusing a ring this way compared to getting the Infused slot free on Mist rings. These aren't necessarily points against Bloodstone trinkets, just considerations; for players who prefer PvE solo farming to co-op/competitive for asc equips, BS is a very attractive option.
---
Only time will tell. I hope so tho...
---
I assume these people have little to no control of their real lives and are trying to control what little they can in game just to feel some small measure of power.  It's not pretty and sometimes the whispers are annoying but whatever, there are better things to do than mull over someone's impotent anger. At least that's how I try to see it.
---
If they had 3 other friends online, why were they asking a random stranger for help. Lots of scammy activity these days it seems...
---
Palette swaps of legendary weapons would be amazing! I mean, we already have sunrise/twilight/eternity, why can't we have more? How about a dark Bifrost- contrasting the idea of additive and subtractive color mixing? Separate versions of Meteorlogicus that don't change based on the day/night cycle? Other seasonal variations on Kudzu? Blue fire Incinerator? There are so many possibilities! And it would really open up some *legendary* combinations for fashion wars!
---
How have I never connected this to CritRole? Maybe because I did this ep with a friend and we just clicked through it for the achi and never even read the text &gt;\_&lt;. Warms my heart though as CR made me start playing D&amp;D :D

Not really, pushing encouragement of 3rd party apps would more than likely discourage their use or would require Arena Net to step in to remedy the situation if mods from the subreddit (a job of sorts in which they'd need to limit their personal bias to some degree to give fair ruling among other things) starting going around telling people to generate an API key to use on a site that more or less reveals to the community the contents of you bank, your in-game wallet, materials storage, character information etc. which can be a sign that the accounts for subreddit mods were hacked and all hell broke loose, something that can affect our (already fairly low in comparison to other MMOs) public image.
---
TLDR: if we did, people might assume mod accounts were hacked and that the subreddit/game itself might not be safe even though the API isn't a bypass/backdoor to hacking the account that generated the API key.
---
And giving trolls free high tier foods would do what exactly?
---
ESO's fashion wars lets you bare as much or as little skin as you want. Outfits aren't hugely different by gender (dresses stay dresses no matter who wears them) and I can mix armor weights.
---
I was doing a bounty train in the desolation and this guy asked for a legendary bounty as soon as I pick it up from the board and said I’ll be doing it next, We got a power outage for 2-3 hours, really felt like I let them down, power outages happen here often so I’m used to it but this one time felt the worst
---
Sometimes you don’t get enough participation credit for the event and hence won’t get the chest - happens a ton when there’s a lot of other players around too.
---
Because cultural armour is meant to be exclusive to each race, we already had an incident with the human light t3 armour being sold on the gemstore and there was an uproar
---
I found this game a little over a week ago, and I'm having a blast. Just hit 80 and about have cooking and armorsmithing maxed out on my warrior. Besides farming hero points what's some good first day at 80 things I should he doing?
---
I'm also excited for the pvp to keep me into this game for a while, but I've been waiting till I fully unlock my trees.
---
I give Ghostly Infusion to my Guildlies if I get it, got it twice so far, we turned it into a meme haha
---
lawd are you a fatty who is upsetty spaghetti about a meme? Im fat, its ok. We cant be upsetty spaghetti about it though. We eat the sghetti to quick. And thats a lot of carbs and we really should be watching that.
---
SW is still the best REPEATABLE farm. Just make sure you switch maps every so often and open on level 49-52, and you get 20 gold per hour. Dragonfall meta has also become popular as a repeatable farm, but we don’t have exact numbers yet.
---
But there are many daily farms that are just as great. Daily fractals comes to mind, with maximum efficiency at 40 gold per hour or something (only if you’re the top 1% of players doe). Istan also goes under the daily farm since it was nerfed to be daily. Weekly raids are also profitable. The HoT metas and now PoF metas give amalg, so could be nice.
---
Yes, it is i
---
Lord knows my forgetful butt will need this, lol.
---
This is just for the quality of life and not a necessity, like all other legendaries in the game. But it'll depend on how anet does it. Obviously they would wanna keep the economy for charms and symbols up there. With your speculation i doubt it would coz... 400g is very easy to fork out, assuming with inflation it goes to 600,is still not that farfetched for someone playing the gane casually.
---
But again, lets see how anet implements this. Note that having this without legendary armor/weapons may be troublesome for you as well, unless you could extract this without the need of an upgrade extractor. Say u put this on berserker gear u have, there's only a handful of runes to choose from, similar to sigils. I diubt you would want something like rune of the renegade or transference sigils on your full berserker character.
---
I've been waiting for years to make Tequatl burgers!
---
They're all much too busy making overpriced skyscale skins to put in the gem store.
---
I dont think it will. Unless anet goes the full on customisable route where you will get full bonuses even if u vary every rune piece to cater your build's needs. Then it becomes power creep. But i do think it will just be a regular rune set whr u can change whenever, and works normally like any rune would, with equal stats. Opens up rune diversity for different encounters :D
---
I agree with all of this! The actual daily/reward trade-offs could be argued all day, but the theory behind them is pretty sound. 
---
I was farming Kourna today for [REDACTED] and I have to say when I realized how many bug events I had to do (5!! When these events end in literally 10-20 seconds) and how many defense events (3, with each taking a minimum of 5 minutes) I was stunned.
---
The kourna map meta is great for getting currency. The hearts are great for getting currency. You have to go FAR out of your way to get the dailies done, and they are absolutely abysmal for getting any amount of currency. 
---
You can go on like this with a few of the other maps, but the ones you mentioned are 2 of the most egregious.
---
Daily rewards should be supplemental rewards to things you would already do, yes, but they should be *noticeable*. Anet has talked about how they use their achievement panel as a content guide-post, since they lack quests in the official sense, but in many cases, the daily guide is telling me NOT to do these random events because it's not worth my time. I was already farming Thunderhead peak metas, so getting daily rewards from those were great. I was already killing Hablion in Bloodstone Fen so a little daily bonus doesn't hurt. I was already getting 1 heart done by doing some random event, so I might as well go the extra mile and do another one for a better reward. But I don't want to go miles out of my way for 1-2 currency pieces. That's insane.
---
Correct. It's unclear whether the backpack is in the shield slot or the shield is in the backpack slot (at the end of the day, it's the same slot).
---
If you wield a shield and have a backpack on, you will see the backpack sliding out when you unsheath your weapon! This happens almost 100% of the time (when watching it, I don't recall ever not seeing it).
---
However, it is possible for the backpack to have it's own slot, they just decided not to add more "attachments" when "converting" from GW1 to GW2.
---
that one is in desolation, not vabbi.

---
something I stopped doing
---
Right, but the three occupy the same time slot at one point. You can get multiple Hero’s Choice chests from the same map, I think. It just depends on whether you’re doing the meta at reset or 1 hour after reset.
---
You could convert them to gold, the convert them into gems for more bl keys lol. Dunno how traumatized about them now tho

This is the pvp lobby is it not? Reaper is maxed out by default there if you have heart of thorns.

Very interesting reading everyone's replies - I'm really surprised so many not only doesn't tip but also doesn't seem to see why you would tip and some being almost vehement in their dismissal of it. I can definitely understand people not tipping and the reasoning behind it but this community is usually so friendly I didn't expect people to be actively against the practice (then again, this *is* reddit ;)).
---
I'm going to keep tipping, not out of obligation but because it makes me feel good to show my appreciation for the portalers and home instance sharers of the game - just tipped for a JP port for the daily and got a very happy response and that just feels like a win-win-win situation in favor of me: I got a port, the mesmer got appreciated/a tip and I got a nice happy reply that made me feel like I helped brighten someone's day a bit. 
---
And to all of you who do things like this just to help people out without expecting anything in return: Thank you, we appreciate you a lot, thank you for making this my favorite gaming community and for offering up your time and help. &lt;3
---
I took the screenshot in the PVP lobby but I maxed it out in PvE  and WvW ^_^
---
Thank you!!
---
Yep, I'm  third of the way through on Scourge. HP and MP trains are so much fun in the HoT maps.
---
Besides, he's not even in the mists anymore
---
It might be that because it was a bug they have no way of confirming that you actually lost more than 1 encapsulator hence can't refund 'cause there is no way of knowing if you are trying to scam support. Ppl have scammed support for leges so. Anyway hopefully the matter gets sorted.
---
Ah, you’re right.  Would be nice if you could get additional chests by doing the OTHER map meta in The Desolation and the Domain of Vabbi.
---
It's just the 2 skill, but it's not really that great for movement speed since you need to have life force available which you don't always have (especially if you're just trying to run somewhere). It's good as an emergency escape if you get attacked or slowed down though.
---
funny thing is, apart from achievements there's nearly no reason to do serpents ire over this, but in the last few days I rarely saw more than 3 other people there, if that at all. 
---
I think people just can't believe such a short and easy meta can give the same reward as the exhaustingly long serpents ire.
---
That's kind of my point - it's a game, and people are doing these things to be nice so why not show them some appreciation for it? If anything it's the waiters in the US that shouldn't be living on tips, they should be paid a living wage from their employers, but that's another subject for another day. ;)
---
Dragonfall with EXP account augments (I only have it at Lv2 at the time of writing) along with a Celebration/Birthday booster, EXP kill streak booster (or the item+exp one), 15% exp food, the 10% from a utility item, and some new year fireworks and I've pretty much got the 3 level ups needed to max out Skyscale within one and a half metas (prioritized kill events over escorts to keep the killstreak going, exceptions were the ones where you escort the NPC to kill the Mender).

Yeah I do hope everyone at least thank the mesmers and home instance owners if nothing else!

---
calm doen there cowboy
---
They didn’t get hero’s chest with the amalgamated at pof launch , only now.
---
calm down there cowboy
---
The event didn’t give hero’s chest with the amalgamated at launch of PoF, only now.
---
it has a chance to reward the chest with the named sunspear weapons, but chances are still very low and the price of those has gone down considerably (\~4-6 gold now instead of 40-80 at the start of PoF). better chance for this chest plus a few additional lootbags (especially those that can contain recipes) would be fine imho, since the meta takes so long.
---
I've mentioned this a few times in posts, but there is a way to prevent this.  He ends up in the air due to either a hookwind pull or officer charge when he takes the path over the little hill to the left in your picture .  Be there to kill everything before AND during escort start and it will go better.  Make sure to have several ppl to suppress the forged quickly just in case
---
Yes. Its a Common element Used in gvgs. 
---
(15vs15) 
---
Just to add: its a Common Thing to counter that by applying Basilisk venom from a Thief to Thema revealing scrapper to make The reveal unblockable again, going through aegis. :)
---
&gt;Coming from Australia I find tipping a rude expectation that is unjustly placed on customers. Everything here is expensive to begin with, I would flat out refuse to give more money than I absolutely have to, social expectation or no. I believe tips should be reserved for exceptional service and anything less than that is not worth more than you get paid for with your salary.
---
Same here in Belgium, though in this case they don't have salaries, doing what they "get paid for" is doing nothing.
---
I never quite understood how taking magic *from* Jormag and Primordus was supposed to put them back to sleep. Wouldn't it have just made them hungrier and *more* awake&gt;
---
Let's put it this way. We saw destoyers in PoF, Desert Highlands. That means the Devs haven't really forgotten about Primordus.
---
The good news is that they were orange destroyers instead of green, so Primordus decreased in power significantly.
---
Togo &gt; Razah, although I would love to see that dope head piece of his.
---
No. Common misconception though. They wake up not when they lack magic but when they sense a bunch of magic in the world (the two often coincide but that's correlation not causation). To Elder Dragons magic is might, so losing magic weakens them. Drain enough and they "faint" (aka go to sleep).
---
Primordus and Jormag were more than just drained though. They were injured by being shot with hostile magic. Hence the mention of Kralkatorrik who had the same happen.
---
&gt;Sure, it sounds like a bad idea NOW, but festival of the four winds is coming up soon and ectos are going to skyrocket in prices. \[...\]  rose quartz 
---
Then just order those materials directly.
---
That's money through speculation, not crafting.
---
Let them know youre willing to pay money to throw milkshakes at them.
---
All the PoF Hero Choice chest META's are just so long and boring I just don't do them. I mean one of the events the boss blocks half your damage with no warning, what an absolute shit mechanic.
---
It took me 3 casual days of getting griffon (with 250g ready), whereas Skyscale took me 7-8 days (with map currency ready). That was before the timegate change though, I've no idea how it works atm.
---
Well I have about 59g and saving to buy too LS episodes I missed this season and those are required I think. :(
---
It's kinda buffling that the effect gets worse and worse... Hope the 4th trinket will fix it in like 2 years from now....
---
I mean, they aren't by default since sylvari are (tm) yknow. Your title implies it's a pic of the ACTUAL original concept.
---
You can sorta control the collision box on landing if you can time a cannonball right. Due to the dismount, it lets you use the Springer jump height with your hitbox size.
---
That said, Scale will probably be better when it gets skins (for some reason, on my setup, if a mount is unskinned it takes a good 30-70 secs to register that I'm on a mount and not just sitting stationary on the ground).
---
Thanks I will definitely be making another pass at wording. Probably instead of saying what I am replacing in Rage instead using the formatting in Rage of 3 bullet points simply explaining all the mechanics. Hopefully will be easier to read.
---
On balance I really don’t think it is too high but I do acknowledge popular opinion. My defence is: 
---
1. Spellcasting on normal Barbarian is never works and this was the only way I could see delivering it, at least the Reaper does spend a lot of its time out of Rage/Shroud so needs something to do, but then again Necro and Transmute are such restricted lists, you can check on dnd-spells, they do nearly nothing combat related.
---
2. Rage is a super powerful ability so removing it pulls the class down a lot in power scale, hence the replaced Shroud can be quite powerful and is mechanically similar giving possibly 200% ish health,
---
3. You are only really in Shroud 50% of the time you would be in Rage, therefore damage bonus should be doubled, giving you a powerful feeling but not changing the actual damage done.
---
4. Most other abilities are also Only in Shroud and are balanced that way, giving you large single damage but not often EG. Executioner Strike is only on bloodied targets and is basically a One Attack plus sneak attack vs a two attack main action, it is like +5 damage that pushes you out of Shroud faster. It just supposed to feel epic.
---
5. I encourage you to think what would a Reaper be doing out of Shroud compared to other Barbarians, and how weak it would feel in combat at those points, and when in Shroud how little time is would actually get, I was trying to keep it feeling desperate...
---
6. Conclusion , I guess it feels complicated because each ability looks overpowered until we further consider the restrictions. I will see what I can do to rewrite that though.
---
Thanks for feedback!
---
Honestly between Skyscale and Griffon, I'd get griffon first. But since Skyscale isn't that much of a gold sink, you can do the collections together. And yeah Skyscale requires all LS4 episodes.
---
Actually it is. Watch out for his buff. ~45sec he is immune to ranged attacks, then he switch his buff to melee attacks immunity for the same 45sec. 
---
All you have to do is just changing your position at right moment :)
---
It depends on what kind of damage you do, to be honest. Metabattle has build guides, including runes. The ones they recommend can sometimes be a bit pricey off the trading post, so get an idea of what they do and find something similar if you can't afford them.
---
Every time I see someone complain about not caring about the characters I tell myself how do they pull that off because I can't find it in me to be indifferent towards anybody. *Anybody*. Even watching nameless NPCs die makes my heart sink

Exactly my thoughts about useless faren
---
How? Surely they can figure out that someone bought 6, only have achievement progress for x amount, have salvaged none and have y remaining which gives you the figure for how many were lost due to a bug.
---
Assuming they can see everything we can see through the API, the only questionable part is the salvaging but I'm pretty sure people have been refunded items like ascended gear they've accidentally salvaged before?
---
&gt;Chronomancer support is super powerful in all areas of PvE. It's been extremely meta since 2015 and it is still very much so to this day. Nothing else can do its job as well as it can. 
---
True, but it's also worth mentioning that it's not alone in the role it used to occupy anymore.
---
Firebrigades replaced the top meta spot for support in fractals. And are an equal alternative in raids.
---
&gt;It's still overpowered even after a plethora of nerfs and reworks.
---
I don't think it's overpowered since chaos chrono nerf, it used to be OP because it was giving all the OP boons. 
---
But the firebrand is pretty much the new chaos chrono in terms of carry ability through boon stacking.
---
Griffon felt like breeze getting it, same was with Skyscale. Both were decent IMO both in design and in achievs. Indeed griffon is more of a gold sink, while skyskale being more a time dedication. 
---
With the new update, if you have all the mats, you can get the skyscale in a day or 2. I would even go the extent to say that it was much easier for me to geather the stacks than to get a hold of 250g.
---
Same. The last time I played was around when LS3 episode 3 was out. Got about halfway through it and dropped off.
---
I started playing again on May 1st. Played through the PoF story, went back and finished LS3 ch 3-6, and have done LS ch 1-4 so far. I've been doing map completion as I go, as well as mounts.
---
I've been having a blast with the game again 😀
---
does this need to be open all day in a browser minimized or is it ok to close it?
---
I accidentally threw away a collection item from Keep Construct \[Stone Soul\] and i put a ticket up for it and asked them to return it to me if possible and got no response. First time contact support since BETA and got no response, seems like the support around this topic just isn't doing their jobs at all.

Scourge is rater good for "left hand only"  operation because you literally do the biggest chunk of DPS by pressing f2-f5 standing in middle of mob pack. And aside Wells and staff there is not a lot ground targeted skills on necro.
---
Every time I'm creating a new character, I want to level it to lvl 80 without dying. I remember doing it as a revenant. I was exploring Mount Maelstorm. I walked into that Inquest lab (where is the CoE entrance), got all POIs and WP. And then an event spawned. An army of Inquest came there to ruin my little challenge. I died.
---
Other goal: finish entire story without dying. I completed core story and moved to the HoT maps to get weaver spec. Auric Basin, Balthazar HP. I didn't even get to that area. I was one-shotted by Balthazar's aoe.

Power chrono with Domination trait line (last trait affects 4th skill in GS - 2 illusionary berserkers instead of 1).

GS and Sword/Sword (or shield if you're running through hell like Arah and need to block attacks).
---
Power mirage works good on Greatsword, deals nice dmg with ambush skills and grants you might (5 per target, so you can easily get 25 stack of might).

Well that makes it even worse.

Casino Blitz has a bug where for some reason you don't even get the meta chest at the end. Not talking the daily Hero's Choice Chest, but the meta reward in general. seems like 50/50 chance for me, can't figure out why it drops sometimes but not othertimes.

Honestly, It's a better time investment to just do the Noran Homestead repeatable heart, then go do the ' Safe room ' JP .   
---
It takes a little bit but it's worth more than doing all the daily chests.

Aetherblade medium gives a skirt with pants connected to it I think

The commander is pretty famous by now. Could we channel ourselves?

And if so, could we channel ourselves channeling ourselves?

nah, still use my bunny to hop. Skyscale is for getting hight to get on my lovely gryff to break map boundries.

No.

Idea for how elite specialization may alter tye core class in a fun and unique way first, theme and character second. 
---
We don't want another Kalla where actual game design came in second, maybe third place and it shows.
---
Indecent Banana, what a cumbersome treat.
---
A toy I can sit on and food I can eat.

Unlike the pie that was lacking in meat.

You're a cure to my hunger, and a freak in my sheets.

And a fun PvP spec too!
---
Are you a power reaper or a condi reaper?
---
still a risen chicken. just free of zhaitans will. which is kinda strange since i always tought the explorable modes are set in time after the story mode...and we kill zhaitan in story mode...sooo, doesn't make any sense i guess.

Disclaimer. The ice sound when you hit something can get really annoying when you’re hitting an enemy with 3 clones. That’s 4 mesmers shooting 3 (with the trait) axes for a total of 12 axes hitting the same enemy in quick succession. And that happens every time you enter mirage cloak. I don’t regret making Frostfang but boi sometimesI just disables the special sounds or limit them in the sound options. Though it’s certainly not as bad as Predator or The Dreamer
---
[Though it can look quite prety](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Imaginary_Axes_Frostfang.gif)  (notice that the axes from the original mesmer, bottom, fail to find a target to hit for some reason, and just keep spinning)
---
It doesn't give the same reward, not even close.
---
It gives the same hero's choice chest which is about 10% of the reward that serpent's ire gives.
---
had similar experiences 100% of the time, it's kids, so don't take it personally. i would have bought it for him tbh
---
He literally changes stance and his aura changes.
---
You're complaining that you've never noticed an effect, but you haven't even looked to see if there is one.
---
Relevant username?
---
Yes, same here as well, two ways how to get the hero's choice chest, but different other rewards.
---
Never liked kits to begin with, I have a cool Rifle, Sword or Pistol and am not using it most of the time.
---
Thats just dumb.
---
Really prefer litterally any other class (besides Elementalist, for the same reason)!

Many gearing questions are answered here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character
---
sorry but you make very little sense
---
for core/common stats crafted exotic was pretty much never worth compared to buying the dropable version(see nika's vs berserker emblazoned prices)
---
you are conveniently disregarding ascended crafting as a whole too, along with stat-swapping
---
remember minstrel or viper exotic crafting prices being pretty much the same as going straight ascended?
---
tl;dr exotics were invalidated years ago, they only exist so you don't run around naked while working on ascended stuff
---
Yes we all miss the good old times of naked Faren running wild in the jungle... 
---
Gosh... he's a war veteran / hero now.... never saw that coming....
---
Not anymore than the actual game does.
---
That would be truly amazing QoL
---
Meanwhile on our server we had an drinking raid. After 3 hours everyone was  loughing on TeamSpeak and our asses got wiped in every fight.  commander felt asleep and never woke up again while we opened an gate :D
---
I joined the Qadim pug the past few week and saw him as tank. I rolled eyes as he tried to make an inspirational speech. Then I was playing a solo rifle kiter. As soon as Qadim and I moved to the second platform, the Hydra blast me off from behind with his flame breath (!) I was confused as hell:
---
- Tank, how the heck did the Hydra jump past  three platforms to come next to me to kill me???
---
Jill: - Kiter is bad and should have dodged. 
---
Then he proceeded to flex his CoZ title to prove that he's a superior one in the argument.
---
The irony is I know the commander whom I took into my CM group and help him with the kills. The commander then just wanted a peaceful kill so we just reset and didn't escalate it.
---
Engineer is like the least played class if you compare them: https://gw2efficiency.com/account/player-statistics
---
Scrapper is only played in PvP/WvW for its strong selfsustain not for outgoing support/healing.
---
In PvE Holosmith is really cool, damage wise and for its looks wich are awesome but kinda lack a bit of functionality to place it in meta comps. You're locked to ONLY dps and can't support unlike Mesmer, Guardians, Elementalists, Revenants, Rangers and Necromancers wich can be played as dps/healer/support.
---
It's not like Springer is useless after you unlock (and even max the masteries of) the Skyscale though.
---
Not if you delay them with a "cast-sequence" and add some 200-500ms inbetween. If you bind that Makro to Logitech/Razor Customer Software ArenaNet has not really any clue if you're using a Makro to input commands or are manually controlling.
---
/r/JustBeggars
---
&gt;What build/gear u recommend for open world?
---
Basically, open world is so easy that anything goes. Therefore I recommend just using Berserker gear for maximum damage.
---
Thanks. That is nice. Maybe crystal bloom races will become a playable race in the future with their own racials and cultural armor.
---
if you like to do world completion you could always grind that out, or you can do some living world story for content as well as getting gear from that. there’s also the many farming maps if you want to grind gold. it’s a lot of stuff that’s available and it comes down to what you wanna do and there’s no good one answer that’s the BEST thing to do when you hit lv80
---
&gt;This implies that Jormag and Primordus may not be asleep after all, but just so injured that they went into a protective, idle state in order to heal.
---
And once they have healed enough, they'll wake up ravenous.
---
Pretty much reaper.
---
\^^
---
I thought the green destroyers were only near primordus.
---
That is just cruel. Rather use asuras.
---
&gt; and some maps have insanely easy hearts for players with 37 characters on their account to abuse.
---
g-good for them? wtf. Fine by me if you have 37 characters.
---
Oh, excellent! I'll try my best to be there :)
---
Even if somehow manages to hack account of a mod of some mmo subreddit and will be so ambitious to edit their post with link just to get API that has no control over account but only provides information and statistics then yeah... in this incredibly small chance-scenario its unsafe...
---
it isnt, theres a repeatable farm that earns much more
---
Happy cake day!
---
You don't really do it for the gold, you do it for the convenience, having different currencies and resources guaranteed every day and very very easily collected. It's a nice thing to max out as a long term goal as well to keep you interested in the game, plus if you ever get too busy or whatever its handy to just pop on for 5mins and loot the thing and log off again, passively gaining stuff like that. I also get a kick out of sharing it with new players or guild mates :)
---
If you're in no rush just use wvw for the daily rewards and you'll max the reward track eventually, without any stress.
---
They didn't care in PoF prime time, they won't care now. Don't hold your breath.
---
If it ever gets fixed it probably will be randomly by one dev who has spare time and is bored out of his mind.
---
I saw that but it didn't load anything. I'll try again
---
I guess it depends on who you are. I find it much easier to get 250g.
---
Missing the two tails :3
---
I used to do Bloodstone Fen and Ember Bay dailies as part of the routine when they were new, but eventually they became irrelevant as there was a critical mass reached with Bitterfrost and onwards. Look at the daily tab now with a dozen of these maps. No one is actually going to do all of them on a daily basis, so I would argue they don't even belong there. It feels like they are just another part of the maps' daily cooldowns and shouldn't be clogging up my UI if I'm not there. I like many of the ideas here to move it into the map or a bonus chest somehow. Even consolidating them would be an improvement.
---
if you want to do raids you should look at the weaver rotation/health pool and see if its for you. maybe talk to a few (weavers) who actually raid. i ended up swapping to druid as I found the rotation too difficult and healthpool unforgiving on weaver. dragonhunter has a lot easier time staying alive and does the same dps with a lot less effort for instance. if you're just going to do open world stuff you can do whatever you want it doesnt matter.
---
\+1,  I would love this feature as well
---
That storyline was so sad and useless, really feels like something went wrong in their overarching storylines.
---
Report, block, move on. This is beyond pathetic and does not deserve your time
---
I tried it but it doesn't work ...
---
Same man. Too bad that:
---
* Scourge
---
* Core engi is below all the powercrept brainless specs in terms of performance
---
* Roaming is dead
---
Hopefully they introduce a core week(end) in WvW/sPvP so we can play it in a more equal field again.
---
I already updated the normal arcdps, i do it first ...
---
Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
Yes, I'll grab a regular Charamel Latte please.

Dying is part of the learning process. If you rely on crutches like passive defense instead of active defense you're never going to learn.

Faren is a really nice guy underneath the self-aggrandizing and that's what makes him so lovable after all this time. I just hope the next time he does something actually badass it is not entirely off-screened

That is a very sad sentence.

And even more sad is that you're not necessarily wrong.

or just in general release more hairstyles!!!

Thanks!

This same person keeps posting to this subreddit with a fake alt saying "love it where did you find it" so they can link to their T-Shirt store.  This whole post is shitty spam.
---
Tbh I found it more jarring as a sylvari main when he appeared after Claw Island and acts like he does not know you. Like wtf mate, we literally worked together already and we're buddies! And he is so cold and distant...
---
He's rich, you know.  
---
With integrity.
---
Ok, so probably more like 20%.
---
You get rewards at the end of every completion step, as well as a bunch at the end.
---
don't craft elder spirit residue, literally cheaper on tp
---
While I'm 100% in favor of seeing Jormag and Primordus in action, I can see how 3 more dragon related plots would become frustrating eventually and difficult to make unique every time.
---
At this point I'd be okay with focusing on other stuff (Cantha, other unknown parts, ...), eventually reaching a point where we have to handle Bubbles, and consider it done. The only thing that makes me sad in this scenario is that we wouldn't have at least seen Jormag directly, but I'm frankly okay with basically never hearing from Primordus again on the other hand.
---
While it's a bit anticlimactic, especially for Jormag, I consider them "addressed".
---
RoS is a good option if you like being in tier 5 until relink, we have alot of ppl, which sits in spawn and meme all day about how bandwagoners destroyed the quality again. Team/map chat is always fun with alot of good copypasta. We also have some of the best stab ingame provided my none other than Helen. Outside of all this we even have commanders there tag once a month for like 30 mins until they quit due the quality of pugs now. If all this sounds like a bargain then come to RoS and see how playing on a sinking ship is.
---
He really deserves that moment to happen, he deserves the recognition.
---
you get a few more blue/green unid. whose price is just a few silver total. what exactly do you think is so much worth in those trash loot chests? just saying chest doesn't mean it has value, if you want to compare value, at least say what the actual rewards are you think are so great.
---
I think this comment might be a bit premature with regards to what OP is asking.
---
There is a reward track enrichment for amulets. You can use that too. Gives +10% or something.
---
I really like the idea of aesgir dragonrender.
---
We have to remember its not just "whos famous", its "who left big imprints in the mists" ie who literally changed the course of history. 
---
Aesgir literally changed history by his actions singlehandedly. Hes reason the norn race still exists. He is worthy.
---
It's somewhere in the settings, more visible party health bars or something similar.
---
Ah, it's  that time of the year again where we want to promote inclusion of people by emphasizing how different they are.
---
How about you simply treat everyone nicely and respectfully the whole year round, instead of a once-a-year showing of how 'enlightened' you are?
---
Is it possible to play GW1 still? How much effort would it take to get the [Living Short Bow](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_Short_Bow) skin (8 Hall of Monuments reward points)? It's the only skin that looks good for my soulbeast...
---
love it where did you find it
---
yes, that's what i said
---
"If your friends jumped off a bridge would you follow them?"  
---
I believe WvW has shown us the answer to this question.
---
Think retroactively this'd work really well - but what would you do for when the new season starts?
---
You’re sort of taking that one point out of context, I have nothing against those people; I AM one of those people.  I was just using that to illustrate how worthless the daily chest rewards are compared to every other method for getting map rewards.
---
Join a HP train for the HOT maps (or do the HP in POF) and then use this build [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest\_-\_Fresh\_Air\_Auramancer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Fresh_Air_Auramancer)
---
It's a lot of fun, has excellent sustain, mobility, and deals enough single target and AOE damage to comfortably run current content. Just remember to always keep moving :)
---
I'd say they will most likely come up with a trinket on/off button eventually. Once we get the full set there is no reason to ever use anything else in any build whatsoever. Right now without a full set I'm still not salvaging any of my trinkets at all and I think Anet has enough statistics to know when this is something dire to implement or if it's still a niche problem.
---
&gt;WvW
---
I have never done a Master Achievment in this LS and i have unlocked 4/6 of them through WvW.
---
We use it in French too though. And they could be Swiss or Austrian.
---
It was a random person asking a guildy.
---
Oh I was definitely focussing on that single point. It just seemed like an odd thing to criticise. I'm agreeing with you regarding everything else.
---
Or those were created before he got the boost from Z/M. Remember, dwarves and destroyers had been fighting for 250 years.
---
Yeah this one definitely sounds less like an awful person and more like untreated mental illness
---
I'd want some characters from the books.  Give me Cobiah Marriner as a scrappy thief that can summon a cannon turret, steal, and so on... or give me Verahd as a wind-based elementalist with supportive and defensive abilities.
---
HP = hero point; TP = trading post.
---
If you check the LFG (looking for group) tool for the verdant brink map regularly you should find someone offering a tour covering all hero points with no mastery requirement but basic gliding eventually. 
---
For easy gold to buy your first gear regularly do your dailies (2g) and farm elder wood to sell at the trading post (about 3-5 g per stack, always list at sell price, never sell at buy price) and sell other stuff you loot and do not need on the trading post.
---
Like some said, dont forget boosts.  There's the amur enrichment mentioned, but there's also the guild hall bartender boost to wvw reward track.  There are also personal boosters such as birthday boosters, black lion boosters, etc.  Search your inventory/bank on "boost" and you might have some that can also speed up the reward track xp.  Without boosts it can take somewhere near 8 hrs at T6 participation to complete a reward track, but with max boosts it can be lowered to around 5 1/2 hrs, and daily pot can help too.
---
They restored my 6th birthday gift to its unopened state because I chose the wrong dye kit with literally no issues, I can't see why they wouldn't restore an item that was lost that was completely out of your control.
---
You said you can do something if you want to. Not really true. Even if you want to,it doesn't mean you should. Also,it is useless to the entire LGBT community,since all this will be remembered as will be a cringefest. Bet ya 15.
---
Still the same game, don't bother starting it. You will just get disapointed. The current devs have no clue about game design and the OG devs from Guild Wars 1 are not working on that game anymore. They jumped the sinking ship which is GW2.
---
It's a decent  idea but we all know the next legend  for revenant  is Lord Faren legendary  hero of tyria
---
You can set the reward track to repeat so you don't switch to something random when you finish it.
---
There doesn't have to be equal gender representation.  Why even try and force that?
---
Interesting take on this.  So, I've actually been using the above build linked by another redditor [here.](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vdAQJAsenEIDlIjlYBWIDcJjFIkqvkT5YGcb+mT4LAimpB-jxRBQBA4BAkk9HwjeiIoE8BnAgio8Lgq/AA-e)  It's a sword and shield setup for survivability.  At first I didn't like it, but I'm getting used to it and really liking it.  My only gripe is how SLOW my character is compared to other characters in my party.  I realize the rifle build is the "top dog" in terms of damage, but if you were to rate it in terms of its performance whilst playing solo, how would you rate it?
---
Couple questions:  First, what makes sword part of a self-sufficient build?  Second, why do you say what you say about hard light arena and spectrum shield?  I'm just not experienced enough of a player to take your comments and immediately know why you made them.  From my perspective, spectrum shield is my "bubble" which I'm pretty sure saved my ass a number of times last night on the level 24 nightmare fractal(which I had absolutely zero business in).  Also, I figured hard light arena was really, really good.  So, I'm trying to learn our differences in opinion.
---
Well, we also have dragon wings. That doesn't mean the wing of actual dragons are decorative replicas.
---
they actually used skimmer to move faster
---
Yes, it's available on Steam. See this guide: https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guide_to_earning_Hall_of_Monuments_rewards#Efficient_order_for_gathering_30_points
---
I'm not sure how long it would take to get 8 points, I got to 9 without much trouble, but I had some veteran players help me out with pets.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Instant_Reward_Track_Progress
---
The more pips you get, the faster you earn these, which lets you power through your reward track faster.
---
There's so much wrong with this post, it's not even funny. There are devs from Guild Wars 1 still working on this game. And just because you don't like something doesn't mean the devs don't have a clue. Because the are plenty of people who do like the game as it stands.  There are all sorts of people who want all sorts of things. Clearly the devs can't cater to every demographic. They certainly cater to my demographic, however.
---
That resolution is terrible.  It's like you're playing on a TI-83 calculator.
---
This isn't a question but I didn't know where else to put it. I believe we have figured out the Akili bug. To get a successfully not-bugged Akili, you need to enter a map where nobody has done the Skyscale rift thing above the telescope. That seems to be the common factor for finding not-bugged Akili instances.
---
Are you one of those "playing for items" type? The predictable outcome of you returning is terribly predictable, there is no need to answer.
---
Yeah. After a season completes, once the next living world  episode or expansion is released they should group all separate dailies from a season and put them all together in one category with a selection of  achievements for all maps in that season.
---
They could even give living world dailies their own AP cap separate from dailies, and move to that cap all the unobtainable AP from season 1 story and season 1 side stories, allowing new players to get that AP without taking it away from old players.
---
I think that’s a bit or an exception given that he is a Lich. Isn’t the whole point of Revenant that you channel the mists and hero’s and villains that are dead?
---
A full stack of mithril ore right now is 1g and I’m not even getting close to that from doing AB, so I have no idea how you’re getting 10g+ from those metas.
---
Turns out it's actually pretty easy to code yourself into a big hole
---
All the possible salty, trollish responses in the world were available to you, and you picked  ...*this one*. I would say "I am so far beyond disappointed", but I suppose you're pretty familiar with disappointing people by now in just about every aspect of your life and relationships.
---
With mounts it super easy too
---
You can just raptor jump past all the traps with the exception of the jumping puzzle pit which is super short anyway
---
Takes less than a minute
---
Hahaha yes dozens
---
Bring your guardian to 80...
---
Beside that I like necros
---
Engineer.
---
You can put all of your coin except a round number (like 10 or 100 gold) in a buy offer that will never be fulfilled, like 100 gold for an item that never goes under 3000.
---
Then at the end of the session, you just substract the initial round number from your current gold.
---
probably when they fix the straits of devestation escort quests :(
---
Just chiming in a bit that if that ever happens again, asking around if anyone in your squad has siege generally works and someone would always have a cata/ram or two they can donate. Or maybe it's just that my server's nice. :o
---
If we could at least salvage them for a chance of scribing materials, all these useless recipes would not be as useless.
---
lol, what an idiot. I added the bit about being able to get more rares when tagging more champs because I felt it was more honest to include it.
---
unlike you I don't make numbers up or feel the need to lie. all you do is claim idiotic numbers with no backing and then lash out like a child. 
---
like when was a green or blue unid ever worth more than 30s individually? gw2efficiency shows the worth of items gained based on current market price. so if you want the raw data:
---
[https://imgur.com/pVlnhP5](https://imgur.com/pVlnhP5)
---
Just try them out. They all have different playstyles and even classes that don't sound interesting might end up surprisingly fun.
---
To give an idea how they look at lvl 80, you can bring them into the pvp lobby by clicking the crossed-swords icon on top. Only really target dummies in there, but you'll have all your stuff unlocked. Just gotta buy cheap weapons for a few copper coins and you can test pretty much everything.
---
People on here think they know everything about development. News flash for y'all: it's actually really easy to fuck it up.
---
However, what's not easy is releasing something that fucks up every single time it runs. You have to do one single test to see this happen. It's pretty shameful to let something like this slip by, especially when they could have just chosen some other event for the collection.
---
No. Less paid for outfits, please. Let us earn it through quests/achievements.
---
Choya used to come out and fight in the beta, but they disabled that.
---
Same as with betting on cow races.
---
LOL now this statements answers a lot of questions i had reading through your comments.
---
what back piece is that
---
I run power Chrono in open world.  It's the bees knees.
---
Make all your alts now. Each character gets a yearly birthday, the sooner you make your alts, the better.
---
As for a more precise answer, necro is easy to get into and fun, especially if you get the reaper specialisation .
---
From hero of tyria to center of the universe.
---
Thanks man
---
Only have 2 slots
---
Also as laborious as it all is, at the end of the day, SS is effectively free content that adds something fun and rewarding but not at all necessary for the game. Looking at it through that lens almost instantly made me calm down after realizing how time-gated it is at first.
---
we did the same a while ago on Elona :D 
---
but we all could laugh about it :)
---
To be fair the O button defaults to the gemstore
---
ded gaem
---
Exactly you channel things from the mists. He's not in the mists. Hell he never actually moves on to the mist in gw2 at the end of his story.
---
If you're an inexperienced player you're not going to solo arah easily, lupi is bugged for years and hits ranged attacks in melee and honestly the only path you could solo is P2 and even that one is pretty hard.
---
Oh don't worry they will sell it to you.... As an outfit! ;) :'(
---
I see what you're saying, but I don't think there's any practical difference between this and the way the game already is.
---
First, I hope you would agree that if just about any game added cash shop items to the game's loot tables that the drop rate would be extremely low.
---
Now it's true that treasure chests and mob drops often give crafting materials, but it's also true that they drop very high value items at a low rate - just like the cash shop items would be dropping at a low rate in your proposed scenario. 
---
So the way it works right now is that when you play you have a very small chance of getting a high value drop, sell it and trade gold to gems to buy whatever you want in the gem store. The way you're proposing, when you play you'd have a very small chance of getting the gem store item itself. Either way, you already can get this stuff from drops at similar rates to what is being proposed here.
---
More generally, though, I would say that if what you're really looking for is drops from mobs and chests that are not just crafting mats, well... the game already does that a lot. Yes, mats are typically the majority of what you get, but you do get other stuff at a pretty reasonable frequency.
---
It also sorts by value, so the fact that the rare unids aren't in that picture means you've edited it or didn't run it for the majority of the event.
---
(Thats every other class bud.)
---
Have you played the game? Every story line has LGBTQ characters in it and there's an NPC in Lions Arch that is trans and will tell you their story when you talk to them. And in Season 1 we saw the start of a lesbian relationship with Majory and Kasmeer, and it has continued since then. So.... if you don't want to see equality and people represented in the game, then maybe you should go find another game.
---
Well, [yeah](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bvku89/perfection/epq5dvw/?context=1).
---
Only because few sick scientists in World Health Organizaton decided, that they are Not sick? That's tragi-comedy...
---
Someone was saying that it's due to Akili running into one of the VM nodes that's part of the rift path and getting knocked back.
---
rare unids don't show up at all. I reset the stack before the meta to keep track. 
---
if you're so convinced I'm lying, how about YOU show some actual proof for your claims? all you did so far was state some idiotic numbers without a single shred of evidence. if you don't like that gw2efficiency doesn't work perfect, record a run yourself and show us all the sick loot you apparently get, but I'm done trying to convince a compulsive liar.
---
well, then you used the word original in a wrong way
---
for story explanation, the machine drained enough magic to put both of them into a dormant state similar to pre-awakening.  So enough power to have their minions like with the destroyers and the icebrood and maybe influence their surrounding area but that's about it.
---
for writing this puts primordus and jormag on the sidelines.  It's one less active plot point to worry about for the near term which is partly why the Kralk finish created a blank slate.  With them in sleep mode they can still be returned down the line through some massive targeted magic source like with Mordremoth.  Suppose a god or powerful Mists-being just channels massive amounts of magic into one of them.  Or maybe we have to wake them up for some reason.
---
There are options to bind keys for toggling snap to ground target on/off, which I use a lot when I'm playing condi holo (lots of ground targeted stuff that I wanna be sure hits). I have it on a button on my mouse so I can easily toggle it on or off. This might be an option, with it bound to somewhere easy to reach on the keyboard perhaps?
---
I can't really see a Trahearne stance because it'd be as spoiler heavy as having one about Eir
---
Youre straight so obviously youre not going to fucking relate to gay people and their experiences. "Just get on with your life" soooo fucking easy to say when you can freely show affection to your partner in public, can talk about your heterosexual relationship around your family/friends/coworkers.  We're STILL NOT equal and those even minor everyday homophobic comments gay people can face daily are a proof of that. 
---
How is acknowledging that straight people dont need a parade because their sexuality IS accepted and deemed as "normal" by 90% of the world bigotry? I love how you try to victimize yourself or something. 
---
&gt;I cannot think of a single thing you cannot do that I cannot as a straight person!!
---
Are you serious or just paaaainfully ignorant? Gay people still can't marry or adopt children. Can't even HOLD HANDS in public with their partners.
---
that's the whole point : no work nor studies nor toddlers and plenty of time. 
---
no tx. find another game and leave us the way we are
---
3 years for the most profitable nodes.
---
Over 5 for the rest.
---
&gt; Gay people still can't marry or adopt children. Can't even HOLD HANDS in public with their partners.
---
Erm yes they can, I have literally seen guys kissing in public and nobody gives a fuck, Steven Fry and Elton John got married and they can adopt children.
---
&gt;I thought it was because of the item being acc bound and they wouldn't  be able to mail it.
---
Items are, at most, account-bound on acquire. If they create the item inside a mail, it'll bind to your account when you acquire it.
---
At least that's how I think they do it. Got a bunch of account-bound Shards of Endeavor restored by GM mail when idiot me crafted one Eureka precursor twice instead of crafting the next tier of the precursor.
---
Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea :) Thanks!
---
Unless you do it in Rata Sum and have glyphs of reaping.
---
40+ bloodstone rubies per day just gathering?  What crackpipe are you smoking?
---
Just be an asura, all you can see is the hat running around, unless you zoom in and see the midget wearing it.
---
&gt;have less rights for being a guy
---
Lmao, are you serious dude? Alabama just dictated a law that jails women for an abortion and it's MEN who have less rights? Unless by "less rights" you mean not having rights to have sex with women you like, incel.
---
I see you are on f2p, getting ascended gear is quite the challenge so i would stick with another class of same armor type: warrior.
---
Downsides of having 2 lvl 80's on F2P is a) you wont be able to max your Silverwastes salvage loot on lvl 49 alt, but on the other hand there is not much you can spend on, b) you wont have spot for all your pvp alts (all the classes - make/play/delete).
---
The Lazarus arch could have been stretched out to two seasons yeah. But I guess another expansion was in the works (delay the Balthazar Reveal until episode 6' cligfhanger)
---
Season 4 would have been the hunt for actual Lazarus (Steamspur mountain blood stone/Orrian map/Door of Komalie map) and some episodes of figuring out where balthazar went, with a map south of Fields of ruin &amp; one south of Mount Maelstrom.
---
What are the easiest meta classes to pug T4 (and eventually CM100/99) with, bonus if they don't rely on others stacking in a certain way to get the most out of them? 
---
I otherwise like Quickbrand but the puke mechanic with teammates that don't stack and how squishy you are with F2+F3 down (if you don't have a healer) makes a lot of fractals like Cove pretty rough, feels like I'm constantly juggling targeted AoEs to affect enemies and allies
---
boobs. and my dick is the stick ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) thats why i prefer my GF and clubs over gaming
---
As reported in the FAQ for Arcdps: 
---
"make sure vs2013 and directx june2010 runtimes are installed"
---
Did you check this?
---
Have you looked and line next to "how do i install, update, or uninstall it"?
---
Some being a patronising cunt and acting all superior, you're not.
---
I'm a newbie in this, but I simply put the d3d9.dll from ArcDPS in the GW2's bin64 folder and it worked normally.
---
It seems you put other files in there that are preventing GW2 to start.
---
Other than that, it seems you reinstalled Windows. As far as I know, you need DirectX 9 to run ArcDPS, did you install it?
---
I see it more like an alchemic metaphor of birth. We're getting something out of that flying turd by LS7E6.
---
The LS episodes currency nodes are definitely worth it if you have a bunch of alts. I keep a stack of each currency on hand for that very reason. The recent patch made them even more worth it.
---
&gt; glint posed a threat to him and his own visions.
---
ED doesn't fear death. So why would Glint pose a threat to him?
---
You totally misunderstood me... I have a lot of friends - gay-lesbian, and they are great people, we are partying together, getting a lot of fun. I love everyone on this planet. The problem is, that LGBT is wrong way to get this along. My gay-lesbian friends are against LGBT and You know why? Because it's aggressive, it's hurting those people, because it's like putting them on rapid-fire from conservative people, who don't accept them. Additionally this censorship over the Internet getting ridicolous and it's giving "Power-boost" to people, who are against. This is not the love-work, it's hate-work and something that make people aggressive (from both sides!). I love this game, I love people and I will not accept politics and any other movements who are making hate in global. Computer game is not a place for Ideology War, don't you think?
---
maybe try check for and try all the troubleshooting suggestions plainly listed on the arc website...
---
What is that? I don't get it
---
I have been wondering a while, so now I must ask!
---
What IS your character?! A toothy beast azura? Details please!
---
Yes, the gold number is how many mastery points you have spent.
---
&gt;Edit: and then a Deadeye uses their elite to counter the counter of the countered counter.
---
so deep even Kanaxai is filing a lawsuit
---
Two blues and a green with some Bloodstone Dust on the side.
---
r/whoosh
---
sadly there is no universal answer besides "rifle bomb build is better overall"..but imma try to clarify my perspective
---
sword is self-sufficient due to personal quickness especially if traited with enhanced capacity..that's around 43% quickness uptime assuming 0 boon duration JUST from sword 3(quickness&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;15% dps modifier)
---
another advantage is that it allows you to skip bomb kit and free a utility slot..i know i said bomb is strong and it is but it depends on your goal: survive/have an easy time or do big dps(you can and should swap utilities around when solo)
---
for mobility you should spam holo #2, use rifle 5(if you have it) and maybe invest into executioner axe or choya pinata tonic..holo isn't the fastest out there either
---
hardlight arena is a glorified protection source cuz regen is pointless and you can get fury from better places..waste of slot
---
spectrum shield is ok for it's purpose however in pve there are, again, better answers than it(such as taking elixir u and dealing more damage so stuff dies before it gets to hit you)
---
you can and should learn to use the defensive abilities you have available instead of taking new ones..between blinds stealth kiting soft and hard cc holo has enough answers in most scenarios to not resort to using such tools
---
the other build you linked is pretty bad..why?
---
it's mostly a meta build modified with silly options..grenadier is a joke(other 2 traits are both better) and enhanced capacity is better solo
---
marauder? air sigil? VAMPIRISM??
---
i would describe it as taking a cake recipe but using mayo instead of milk
---
i think your mistake is trying to find a build to play everywhere..if you want a more solo-focused build i would suggest some diviner pieces because you can be quite self-sufficient with some of the important ones(fury, might, quickness)
---
Visual c++ solved it, thanks!
---
I had logged in and played WvW earlier. I use Launchbuddy to set my graphics for my so I don't have to constantly keep switching them between PvE and WvW.
---
It's the eternal alchemy. Something something balance something something short people.
---
I switch between WvW and PvE quite a bit so I use Launchbuddy to set my graphics settings. Sometimes I play PvE content with my WvW graphics settings. Most of the time, I don't.
---
Knew about it, never tried tho...
---
Should be noted, I finally got credit after killing her for the fourth or fifth time.
---
Gen1 Legendaries. High investment but insane gains.
---
Maybe not the best time x money (since you need both a world completion and a gift of battle).
---
But I sold a Frostfang this weekend and doubled my bank.
---
Actually I think (tinfoil theory here) that Lazarus plot was planned to be dealt with raids but seeing how many players were feeling the story was robbed from them if they weren't raider, they had to change both ep6 and wing 4 encounters.
---
Apparently things also changed after pof and if you read Price's tweets, when she arrived in July 17, she had to break the story into different episodes but the main assets and maps from the first three episodes were already advanced in production (and ep 3 got released almost a year later... And provoked the drama we all know). I would not be surprised if the original intent for Joko was to get freed from the mists by Kralk's assault (Gwen mentions the attack in ep5) but eventually it was decided to not follow two storylines in parallel. While it may have created a better story for Kralk, Joko's one got cut.
---
and hoes does that play into rng o.o
---
Oh and for Warclaw you'll have to capture a keep.  Know that you don't have to actually be standing in the circle when it's captured to get credit.  You can kill a few of the Vet guards outside of the wall and it will count when your server captures it (as long as you don't leave the map).  So if you're going to spend time on a map, it's worth it to make your rounds and tag every tower/camp/keep that way.
---
While this would be nice, I don't think this is the simple fix people claim it to be due to how the game handles textures. 
---
Player Character textures have to fit in a 1024x1024 space, with only around 500x200 for the hair or hat worn by the player. The Swaggering Hat works as it was expressly designed with hair in mind, thus having both the hat and hair in this section. This means every hat would need to be retextured and remodelled to make this change, for every hat and hairstyle combination available across all five races. Unless of course they only did a handful of "hair compatible" styles, then there would be slightly less work. 
---
The only "quick fix" would be to add short scalp hair (which they previously had) as this is handled in the Player Character's skin section.
---
I am supporting LGBT people and I Love everyone, but promoting aggressive ideology is the other thing. I have a lot of gay-lesbian friends, we are partying together, And guess what? They're against LGBT movements, because they think, that's hate Work, Not love-work, it's making both sides aggressive against each other. It's putting them to rapidfire grom conservatives. I love this game, but it's sad, that it's promoting aggressive politics... Hope you get it. MAKE LOVE NOT WAR. MAKE LOVE NOT LGBT politics/ideology.
---
Have Anet said anything about adding Stellar weapons to the Vision collection for Istan? Surprised they weren't counted.
---
They should bring Dragon Bash back, but this time to celebrate Aurene and other friendly dragons instead to celcebrate killing one, and make Basket Brawl its activity in place of Dragon Arena.
---
Jesus Christ. Even in Guild Wars 2 you still end up in fucking Blackreach.
---
It make me sad that there is no soda pop in the game. I made ronald mcdonald toon just to mail random people burger and fries. I can't mail coke because there is no such.
---
When you adventure in gw2 you know exactly what will happen. You find a cool cave, you discover a treasure chest, whaaat treasure, then you open it and get 3 crafting materials and a green weapon hahaha like what the actual fuck, then dont call it a treasure chest? Call it a crafting material chest or something. Even when I go magnet fishing in real life I tend to find weird shit, imagine throwing a magnet in water giving better rewards and adventure then a fantasy game 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Faren has been my boy since day 1, I wish the human noble could recognize this is the man who is still crashing in their estate six years later and hang out with him!
---
So now you're equating a parade for EQUALITY to literal *war*? You sound like a privileged teenager who has never had to fight for their rights and cannot comprehend that there are people in the world who are less fortunate than you. Grow up.
---
&gt; it's making both sides aggressive against each other.
---
Says the one who came to this thread *just* to comment toxicity and try to rile up arguments. At least try to be consistent.
---
This is an incredibly good idea.
---
Run greatsword and spin to win as guardian! Warrior is also plenty of damage starting at a low level.  Really, any class has more than enough damage for 99% of content to be easy mode if you set your build up right.  I recommend picking a class you like the theme and aesthetic of
---
Charr Necro
---
I can assure you that i don't care about Faren.
---
I care more for the interpersonal drama between two random NPCs in Lion's Arch, than I do about Faren.
---
Not as long as theirs mount skins to make
---
Very nice video and intruiging soundtrack choice: can I ask what is the source of the music?
---
Hahahaha! You guys are awesome!
---
Agony resistance hasn't really changed, so it should still be the most efficient method
---
Well, I don't think you can repeat the Warclaw Reward track.
---
Let's state it clear - I Love people, love gay/lesbian people and I want just help them, help them live normally in society. I am against LGBT aggressive movements, because it brings the same from opponents. Don't call me racist or bigotry, because I'm against this kind of people. 
---
Can't there be someone who is in the middle of this? I am against racists, against bigotry and against aggressive LGBT promotion and censorship over Internet.
---
Is it something wrong about me? I just want help LGBT people, Not fighting them, Not accepting ideology war. Simple as that, so Why are You aggressive against me, and calling me the worst?
---
Guess i didn’t see the first ones so I didn’t know. That’s cool tho!
---
top 4 recommended mmos is not niche, niche is playing a game like doofus or wakfu.
---

---
Don't worry about crafting until you h it level 80.
---
Engineer is cool, but be warned that they're not a straightfoward class to play in any of its forms and if you're new you'd better off taking Ranger, Necromancer or Thief.
---
Engineers are fun to play in base, Holosmith and Scrapper forms, but with their fun in versatility also comes difficulty and... some issues.
---
For example, base Engineer and Holosmith are everything you're going to see if you wanna play PVE, core Engineer to a lesser extent. Engi is used as a condition damage dealer (which means, weak attacks that accumulate negative status in the enemies for heavy damage over time, not recommended for open world or story), which is incredibly hard to play; rarely they're used as Power Damage Dealers (Power meaning direct damage) because Holosmith already does it, and better.
---
Holosmith as stated above is mostly used for Power Damage, but it's a very risky class; you can enter Holo Mode, a special form that gives you unique and powerful abilities that cause lot of damage, but also accumulate heat. If your heat surpasses a certain threshold then you explode, suffer damage and become burned. Holosmiths are squishy and they don't have the survivability of other damage dealers, they rely on killing everything before they get killed, or on support from their companions. And also, on you paying attention to not blowing them up. The more Heat they have the stronger they become, so you constantly have to switch in and out of Holo Mode and manage your gauge efficently.
---
The riot you mentioned was because full T3 cultural without effects, only usable for humans costs 120g. Flamekissed had better textures, special fiery effects, was usable for all races and costed around 80-90g when it was released. All the people that spent their gold for the more expensive yet vastly interior set felt rightously scammed.
---
&gt; that would condense the ever-growing list of daily categories immensely
---
This is the most important reason to do this.
---
Done and done! Thanks
---
I used to follow a Commander that would take shots for every structure she took.
---
She, uh, got better as she drank more? Other Commanders that had resigned to not be able to take SMC had logged out after numerous attempts and then she comes in like "hand me a beer" and we had it in her first push. I miss her honestly, most fun I've had in a zerg and since server rematching I haven't followed as competent nor fun a leader since.
---
3 first LWS4 maps give 5. The 3 last give 25.
---
So If someone only owns a single living story, he will get 12 dailies on the same map every day? :D
---
Could be Swiss.
---
https://gw2crafts.net/ is the easy way.
---
I've been recording them fine on meta runs and Dragonfall metas all week. You're just a liar.
---
Piken is the best
---
and once you hit lvl 80 and want to level a craft, maybe use a guide like gw2crafts.net
---
Dude like you find this EVERYWHERE. Its infuriating.
---
IM the kind of person who sees a homeless person asking for food money and ill go and take the person to buy lunch ( sometimes they over did it with the amount of shit they ordered but who cares atleast i know it was food) and while ive had some mildly annoying situations i put up with some of the attitudes.
---
Once though, a guy asked me for a sunday at McDonalds. I agreed. And while im waiting in line The dude popped his head into the restaurant and started screaming at me  asking me " How much times does a single fucking sunday take? Wheres my fucking Sunday?"
---
And u can guess that sadly since , I haven't been as generous to anyone begging on the streets.
---
20% is fine, I think
---
And I'm fine with that. We need more lore-relevant legendaries.

Or Austrian.
---
I said screw meta and got a set of runes with 25% runspeed bonus.
---
Time makes a huge different. Im in a tier 2 (wvw rankings) sometimes T1 server and we're still dead sometimes with no commander. It could be as someone said you're playing on the servers off time. Consider hopping servers or joining when reset occurs (Fridays?) that's when a TON of people play wvw.
---
Where did I call you racist? Would you like to link any evidence or are you just lying again?
---
&gt;I Love people, love gay/lesbian people
---
You literally compared them to CANCER in another comment. Quit lying. You can't be both a hateful bigot and a good Samaritan at the same time.
---
&gt;Is it something wrong about me?
---
Did you actually read my previous comments? Why are you trying to waste my time? I've pointed out plenty of logical errors and hypocrisy in your comments, why can't you learn to read instead of badgering me and pretending you don't get it?
---
Yes really.  Oh and I am against Affirmative Action.  You have no point to make, you've done drunk the koolaid friend.
---
in all the years i've been playing, i didnt know this one existed
---
as others have said, [gw2crafts.net](https://gw2crafts.net) is the site to use to level up crafting. 
---
Once you do level it up to 400, you'd eventually want to go up to 500 so that you can craft the time-gated stuff daily. Those can earn you gold whenever a net mat sink is introduced.
---
For example, the Vision legendary trinket requires xunlai ingots (which uses the time-gated lump of mithrillium). If you have a stockpile of those, then you can craft a lot of xunlai with a high mark-up price - easily &gt;2 gold profit per item.
---
I mean I'm very sorry the government taxes their tips, that's fucked up. That ain't my fault. It would appear to me that waitresses are one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. If you show me a piece of paper that says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it. Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it. But what I won't do is play ball. And this non-college bullshit you're givin' me, I got two words for that: learn to fuckin' type, 'cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent you're in for a big fuckin' surprise.
---
As others said - the game provides decent enough drops until level 80, and even then buying exotic (highest tier purchasable) gear pays off more than crafting it.
---
Crafting then plays a part for higher tier (ascended/legendary) gear, food and utility buffs and collections.
---
Just gather up materials and gold as you level up so you have a stockpile for when you need it.
---
stay on PvE sound a good solution if you want to get carried
---
how to spot a german, just look out for the "\^\^"

If it's a simple JP, a simple thanks, if it's a complicated one 0,50 to 1G.
---
Thief or a warrior I'd say.
---
&gt; you accept them and trying to help them get along in the society.
---
...by coming to a thread about pride, shitting all over it, calling us cancer, calling us mentally ill, saying our existence is as bad as warfare, and *using the suicide of your friend as a means to say "I told you so"*.
---
I've explained this to you over and over again, but you don't understand. You are not a kind soul, you are not a good soul. You think you're "helping" but what you're doing is being hateful, spewing unscientific, unconvincing and unsubstantiated lies. You probably don't actually do anything in the real world to help people. You come here and you think you do good by insulting LGBT people but you really just make yourself look embarrassing and backwards. You literally came here with the intention to [shame and belittle people](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bvnf60/tyria_pride_2019_eu_and_na_information/epw9ja2/) so fuck off with your "I'm just trying to help" lies.
---
This is my last word to you as you clearly still don't get it. The fact that you unironically compare being gay to a literal disease, cancer, warfare etc, and you still try to make yourself look like the good guy, lol. Blocked.
---
Are you sure you have talked to Hilina? (the one near the forge ; not the volatile magic npc on the forge area) if you've talk to her I really don't know why she doesn't sell you anything :/
---
depends on how you play i guess. i got my 80 boost and bought a set of exotic armor and started raiding week 2. definitely something to think about. cant see how its not relevant. a lot better to think about it first rather than being like me and having to make the reroll decision.
---
never seen this one before!
---
I see crafting for 3 goals
---
* Fast and cheap way to exp a character (cooking to 400 is less than 5 golds and gives you 10 character level)
---
* First ascended armor (lvl 500 needed), as you'll later drop a lot but the first one is hard to get without crafting
---
* Daily crafts for money making
---
During your progression to 80, don't bother doing crafting except if you want to exp your character faster (check gw2craft already linked). For your gear, buy cheap gear (rare at best) of your level from hearts in the map or from the Trading Post (O key). If you're power you can find exotic gear (berserker) in dungeon (citadel of flames, arah and crucible of eternity) before focusing on crafting ascended armor/weapons
---
I never did like the whole "do all the things" mentality of dailies. I don't want to divide my precious daily game time across several maps and activities. I'd rather focus on just one or two things.
---
this is exactly what needs to be done - for alot of items!
---
no its not
---
[removed]
---
Yes, it's a good choice. You start the story from H menu.
---
Simply activate PoF from your story journal. You'll get a mount in the very first mission.
---

Higher tiers just have more people and usually worse quality of players. Generally it doesn't matter at all.
---
I don't think there are 12 dailies for a single episode atm (even including the rotating dailies) but maybe 6 would be fair?
---
Thank you! Perfect
---
Awesome good to hear!
---
&gt;Drain enough and they "faint" (aka go to sleep)
---
Can you then capture them with a pokeball?
---
I don't tip daily JP but put my xera portal after finishing it
---
I don't tip home instance and don't expect tip when I open it (only game content, no gemstore)
---
I tip when I teleport 10 characters to a farming spot like malchor's leap yeah
---
If you don't care about the story, it won't hurt you that much. Getting a basic mount like the raptor, which you get from the first PoF story mission, will also help you elsewhere in the game. You can begin it by starting "Sparking the Flame" under path of fire act one in your story journal, and following the story from there.
---
Read again.
---
I'm really sorry, if you feel bad about my words, I was using hyperbole about some important facts, that fight with anyone You can do bad things. This discussion shows it perfectly. Think about it. Love each other!

I had to react, that something, that someone's personal sexual perception is Not the point of making ideology and showing it to everyone. Everyone's sexuality is his own thing, people can feel offended by many things. I feel offended when someone showing something unappropriate.

I would be ecstatic if i could just PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD turn legendary effects off
---
i only need legendaries for convenience sake, but i have to choose between that and my character's looks being ruined...

Yes!
---
It's a bug with Mesmer clones.
---
If a Mesmer is wearing either Aurora or Vision, their clones will have the effects of wearing both for some reason.
---
If a Mesmer is wearing both Aurora and Vision, their clones have an effect that includes a black ball linked to the other four glowing balls.
---
Here is a good [video guide](https://youtu.be/-Y2czD6BREw) for getting Action Cam options set up so he has the best experience.
---
I agree that Thief and Warrior are probably the best picks, but Guardian and Ranger would be decent options too.  If he's looking for a more complex character down the road Dagger/Dagger Elementalist might be a good fit.
---
So your parents tossed you out of the house at 16 because you were straight? EMTs refused to treat you because you're straight and white? You got thrown out of your apartment because someone found out you took a girl home one day? Someone refused to hire you after they found out you have a girlfriend?
---
Stop being so fucking delusional.
---
Smoant replied to my post. Between $25 ~ $35.
---
what?
---
What about Caudecus? Him sieging DE was mediocre, too bad it wasn't more fleshed out and longer. He was arguably the best "normal" (not overpowered being above other ones) villain for human race so far. Anet should release each villain/antagonist that endangers specific race.
---
Skyscale actually can go as fast as springer, because it has a boost. There was a video recently comparing the skyscale to the springer and other mounts. It also is more precise and less prone to a single error sending you plummeting all the way back to your starting location. 
---
The skyscale best use case is difficult terrain. Too high for springer, too far for raptor, a gap with the far side higher than the near side so the griffon can't make it, overhanging ledges, etc. But it's a good general-purpose mount as well, because it can handle almost anything you throw at it.
---
That’s true, and thats why my comment wasn’t very serious. However he has 100+ statuettes, so that’s still over 200 gold by your estimate. I’m guessing that’s from buying [T6 mats](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heavy_Crafting_Bag) and selling them on the tp.
---
However, right now is an AMAZING opportunity to make money off of [black lion claim tickets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Claim_Ticket)! (This is getting into playing the tp so if you’re not comfortable with that that’s fine) The branded skins are super nice and probably going to jack up in price when it goes off of ticket rotation (over 200g). Since the tickets are 50 statuettes each, and branded skins are 1 ticket each (for a limited time) that’s double the worth of t6 mats, if you do it right. Just wait as long as you’re comfortable, since you need to sell it before it comes back into the ticket rotation, plummeting the price. I’ll leave choosing the weapon skin up to you; you want to pick the one that you think is the most popular.
---
Or if you’re scared of all that, [golden bl keys](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Golden_Black_Lion_Chest_Key) exist as well for 50 statuettes. Hearn it’s not the best value, but it’s still a guaranteed rare item.
---
I personally just farm map completion for keys, and got the branded back piece out of it. If you’re lucky, that’s a viable option too.
---
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.
---
We DO bring severe problems to the table, it's not our fault that every time we bring up said severe problems you tell us they're not real problems and refuse to listen
---
personally, i think the next season will be us dealing with Taimi's situation.
---
Ahh thanks
---
What severe problems do you bring in a game that already accepts you? Oh please.
---
Balthazar was the center of an expansion
---
since you said you really don't care about story..i would say just go ahead and do all of pof unlock all the pof mounts and if you complete the pof story you can start the griffon collection. go to wvw and spend 1 point in the warclaw so you can start that collection. run season 4 and unlock roller beetle and skyscale.
---
Is there a map completion train planned? Sadly I missed the last one.
---
Slapping Shadow Abyss dye on random Heavy Armor pieces is as much a cosplay as me painting my face green and calling myself Green Goblin at Comic Con.
---
It looks good, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't at all say "WC Death Knight" to me. It looks like a generalized fantasy Dark Knight.
---
So then maybe it's you who doesn't belong in the game rather than LGBT pride :)
---
Late to the party here, but I would argue that Trahearne isn't a Reaper at all. He's a core necro who can replace his weapon skill bar with Caladbolg's skills (as do you in the Sylvari personal story), which bear no resemblance to Reaper skills. 
---
Now Marjorie, SHE'S clearly a Reaper, and they even sort of show a training process as she works on the elite spec.
---
If you're already thinking about playing something else. Consider making your guardian an alt and start leveling your engineer. Best class.
---
Just set it like you would for the folks that don't have expansions or don't have high level characters yet: replace those dailies with ones that are actually doable on that account. Ever looked at the dailies on a low level account? Guarantee it "Orr Forager" isn't on it, nor anything to do with expansions that aren't owned. If the dailies for that day include something impossible for your account it will reroll that one to something you can do, like "Brisban Wildlands event completer" or something.
---
It depends who has the best  PPT night squad
---
Tonics can't be dyed =  Failure.
---
LGBT pride is about our right to exist in the face of adversity 
---
You called that "dumb problems"
---
therefore our existence is a "dumb problem"
---
So how about you fuck off already
---
Lmao I have a reaper but I'm poor so I use cobalt's skin too. Actually I never even bought it, I just saw it in my inventory one day and thought it was cool. Sad that it only lights up the area for you though
---
Far better than Jora, that's for sure.
---
Legends are also a good opportunity to create new characters from an ancient past. For example, what about someone like the last queen of the jotun?
---
No legends at all would have been fine too, using "obscure schools of magic" instead, or alternatively, go full dervish and channel gods from obscure religions, like Zintl or Koda.
---
I think they went too hard on fanservice and nostalgia, and it kinda falls flat.
---
We had Moa gambling and/then the fighting duels in thunderhead, so why not let us bet on choyas fighting.
---
What's the reward for creating PVP alts?
---
It's true that the poor in one country may have a higher standard of living than the poor of another country, but people still live paycheck to paycheck in "rich" countries, and what is considered a necessity here may not be in another country. I mean, getting a job nowadays pretty much requires an internet connection, a lot of people need the internet for work, etc. 
---
I'm mostly speaking against the perception some folks have about Americans that we're all rich and never have to worry about anything, when the only reason we're considered "rich" is because a few people have billions of dollars
---
Open world PvE (Quests/leveling/exploring) literally any class you find fun. Some are stronger than others but they are all viable to have fun. Guardian and Necromancer are generally pretty good choices.   
---
If you plan to play WvW (large open world PvP) Guardian, Necro, Engi (specifically Firebrand(PoF), Scourge(PoF), Scrapper (HoT) respectively) are all core classes to a WvW group. (This is generally level 80 content and for the most part "require" the elite specs from the expansions)
---
Fractals of the Mist (like dungeons with increasing difficulty)/Raids (Endgame content): TBH I wouldn't worry about this at level 12. You have so much to see and learn and you never know how the meta will change.
---
Those are nobodies, or just don't have any unique magic of their own. Also, they would fit other professions better. Pirate with cannons? Move it to the engineer.
---
It's a strong and fun class. If you're worried about engi being a jack of all trades, don't. Because every class in gw2 is like that too.
---
Every class can dps (condition dmg or power dmg) ,support or be hard to kill.
---
Bold assumptions. Also, i do get to do so.
---

For this one I'm using a mix of Starry Night, Royal Blue, Midnight Ice, and Shadow Blue.

being able to play all classes
---
Is this guy a one-character-fits-all type of player, or does he like playing different characters with different themes and playstyles?
---
I play 12 toons, and always use action camera. My favourite professions for a fast-paced action camera world solo/world boss adventures all require expansions (GS/SS Chronomancer, Staff Daredevil, Dagger/Warhorn Weaver). The one profession I'd suggest for a free account would be a Power Ranger with Greatsword/Longbow. It allows you to charge into melee with a greatsword most of the time, but also disengage into the backlines and keep firing from a distance. You also have a choice of pets, where some like bears can act as a tank for soloing, and other pets fill various other roles. 
---
I like [this](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger_-_Longbow_Beastmastery) build, but I've replaced "Protect Me" with Lightning Reflexes **only** because I play with action camera. This should be doable with the free version of the game. :)
---
As soon as your friend caves in and buys the expansions, though, direct him to the Daredevil or the Mirage. These two professions are all about dodging and active skills; you become near-invulnerable by the sheer virtue of always doing something, going somewhere, hurting someone. The mirage is extremely flashy, so should satisfy the Mortal Kombat/Tekken/Street Fighter aspect of fast-paced combat as well, whereas the staff Daredevil is a bit more Devil May Cry and Dynasty Warriors. If that makes sense.
---
It's almost 100% Coalescence (raid ring) which is supposed to be coming with W7. The entire theme of the collection around coalescence is calming, controlling and condensing malevolent energy. So the inky black orb of evilness being held together in a bubble fits thematically.
---
... why the fuck not tho?
---
BIND ACTION COMBAT CAM FOR HIM. It is in the options. I have it bound to Mouse 3 for easy back and forth.
---
I actually wanted a Joko stance with cute undead Minions but Trahearne would work too for that. :3 His minions could use some uniqueness added.
---
(What I really want from Trahearne though is a similar face added to make-over kits; he's the prettiest boi)
---
TBH even after you hit 80 on your first char, crafts are not 100% necessary. I only started crafts with 3 lv80 chars after gearing them with cheap bersekers or rampagers exotics from the tp.
---
My first asc were from fractals, but u can easily get them from LW maps now too. I started with asc trinkets (fractals or LWs) before starting to move on to armor.
---
The only exception is if you have a static raid group requiring asc. but that's not necessary for raids. Just exotics
---
(With asc trinkets) and a good build(+practice) will do.
---
For everything else just enjoy the game til you find yourself wealthy enough (100+ gold) to start crafting for asc.
---
While that would be neat, his death may be a bit recent for Revenant. Like a new player could pick Rev and see Legendary Marshal Stance and end up learning it before they even finish the Orr story, let alone get to HoT, which would kinda spoil it. But if you really wanted to go Sylvari and Caladbolg, there is always Riannoc. He dies before the game starts so there is no risk of spoiling anything there.
---
Personally, I'm hoping the next or a future Rev spec is Snaff. I'd say he is the perfect pick for a GW2 legend. He died before the game and honestly barely comes up in the game at all yet he is very important to the game. Also, a Legendary Genius Stance focused on Golemancy would be pretty neat.
---
Because not everything has to be equally represented for arbitrary reasons?  The only reason you think they need to be equally represented wasn't for any reason other than gender representation in a video game.  I know this because you brought up the point and explicitly grouped the legends by gender.
---
Dont worry about it man, everyone was there once.  And even veteran players can get rusty on stuff.  Some questions on your edit that put in #5.  Do you have vanilla, heart of thorns and/or path of fire.  Do you want to dps or condi shit?  Do you care about meta builds or is something  non meta ok with you.
---
Have to ask as I rarely run meta, personal preference  really meta builds are by and large better than what I run.  I just like to accomplish tasks in my own way.
---
I should be able to remake an old build of mine that I used for years on my guardian.
---
If they're selectable rewards, the UI should be like [Skirmish Chests](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skirmish_Chest) where opening the chest pops a vendor window with the option in the bottom-right corner to change quantity.
---
Otherwise we end up clicking through menus for a 1 trophy reward each time.
---
I think a more important problem to solve is the abandonment of maps that aren't generally rewarding enough.
---
Yeah, Elixir Addiction could be updated to make the rewards suit the effort, but that daily being in the state it's in doesn't prevent Bitterfrost Frontier from being one of the most populated LWS3 maps.
---
You mention Lake Doric at the end of your post, great example. Whenever I include that map in a tour, all I find myself doing is going to the northern area to get the apple and unbound magic dailies done, then I leave. Bringing up the other dailies could improve engagement with the rest of that map. Then again, so could a popular achievement, a rare boss drop, or something else.
---
Thank you for this lengthy response!  So, I'm learning from this.  I've never considered sword 3 very useful for quickness, as it only lasts for 3 seconds.  That's because I didn't understand boon duration gear - until now.  This all makes sense.  Tonight, I'm going to go through my build, piece by piece and refer to this.
---
Buy the scroll items to teleport any character you want to those maps.
---
You need to buy the portal scrolls which will eat into you violital magic big time or TP to friend.
---
Skyscale? If so TP to F to save magic
---
You don't need to do the story. You just need to buy the to scroll for the zone https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Portal_Scroll
---
Oh yeah forgot about the scrolls thanks
---
did it without guide and took 10min max per item while finding many of them right away
---
Okay - looks like the GW2 fairies have fixed it already -)  5 mins of mayhem.
---
Forgot about them, thanks

It's not supposed to lead you directly to the item, it's encouraging exploration of the area.

---
All pugs are bad, but bg pugs beat CD or nsp pugs any day
---
And those are the better clues. Check out the egg clues. They're all just "Somewhere in X". 
---
But beyond clue quality itself, I think there's just an issue where I know there is so much collecting to do, there are many steps after it all, and there are time gates. With this in mind, wandering around the same map over and over with these clues hoping to find each one just feels like punishing myself. The real value of the whole system is merely that they're all individually marked and numbered. Gone are the old days of just being told you have 18/21 eggs, good luck guessing which you don't have.
---
The Skyscale of [Element] step of the whole process is much better IMO.
---
hopefully they are gonna fix it soon i really wanna start on those  neat looking stellar weps as soon as i can :D
---
I'm a non LGBT and i most definitely don't hate anything about it, and i'm going.
---
The only nonsense here is your stupid post... Maybe stop being an asshole to others?
---
&gt; I'm drunk, but I do think I have a case..
---
That's fair; no one should force you to like an elite spec or theme after all since aesthetics/preferences are subjective.  That's the beauty of the 9 professions and 18 elite specs, though, is that we get variety, so hopefully the 3rd elite spec legend will appeal more to what you want!
---
This. I mained a guardian for years. And recently fell in love with my necro, who is my main for the past ~3 months. Unless you hate the way your guardian plays, level him/her to 80 first.

whilst aurenes crystals are more rounded than kralks (im sure theres a geological term for it, but im not geologist)... i dont think the flower was aurene; i think the flower came from caithe (afterall; it was a union); its not like when aurene overbrands (or when she glues kralks head in the keep) crystal blooms explode everywhere; its just blue crystal (actually now that i think about it; a lot of the larger kralk crystals are rounded/warped too so theres not really that distinction either)
---
This hints are written for a drunk 3 year old. They can't get any easier
---
Almost every heart from LWS4 is easily done, except only a select few. Check the wiki for each heart and see what activity gives the best heart% for your time. Got all the stacks in just a few days (3-4 days with only 1,5-2 hrs dedicated for hearts on 3 toons, pop some boosters for extras)
---
got to love the 4.5 salad themed armour sets we get =[
---
Unique magic isn't necessary to be a stance.  Kalla didn't have unique magic but they figured out a way to use her warband and whatnot.  
---
Cobiah could introduce the Dagger to the Revenant class, and he could have damage-heavy skills or maybe boons.  We know he was strong, cunning, agile, and persistent.  Maybe Cobiah would be a counter-CC stance that has a large attack, ways to stun/break stun, and give might/swiftness boons.  Maybe since Cobiah was the unifier of races, his utility skills would call support from others like Isaye, Macha, Sykox, and so on.  Kalla does something similar.
---
Since S3, I feel like Lake Doric and the Skyscale are some of the only collections that you could do mostly without a guide. More collections need to be like those ones where they give you enough information so you can figure it out (for the most part) without consulting anything outside of the game.
---
We've been down that path before actually. Did not end well.
---
This is the best way!
---
A cleaver advice.
---
As long as it looks enough like a sword that it’s recognizable, I guess that’s enough haha
---
I could try! But I’m not very good at coloring unfortunately...
---
Well regardless, she looks fantastic and if you keep her like this then it's still awesome! Great work!
---
The glitch previously showed only the step after what you're on at the moment, it's reasonable to believe the current glitch is showing step 3 since the 4th trinket isn't in the game yet
---
Jade constructs are green-redish because of bloodstone magic created them. Jade is green in GW and GW2
---
Red jade also exists IRL.
---
On top of this, I believe Jade can be naturally red as well
---
Also, that would be business days so only Mon-Fri
---
And that jade isn't even pure red, it's a bit purple, almost like the blue pigments in green are influencing the colors. It's almost definitely a result of bloodstone meddling and how this jade was formed that resulted in the redder tint.
---
Yeah that is exactly my point. no buts. :P
---
I'm only annoyed when someone make statements that make me feel they wouldn't trot the same position if the case was of something they personally found appealing which is basically what their comment implied.
---
They work on weekends, but yes over weekends it takes longer.
---
Jade can be a variety of colours, [not just green](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Purple_jade_%28metaphonolite%29_Bursa_Province%2C_northwestern_Turkey.jpg).
---
In addition there are actually two types of Jade: Nephrite and Jadeite.
---
Yeah but we have no idea the reason it showed step 2 instead of step 1 was because it was actually just adding 1 like you suggest, as opposed to something like double counting your accessory (both 1+1 and 1x2 are 2 after all), or something more nonsensical, because glitches are often weird. That was my point.
---
Hmm, 
---
" Exhibit B:  Skyscale Scales #6   On a moss-covered branch to the north of a moss-covered wood. "
---
Written for an intoxicated 3 year old, really?
---
I agree that the hints could definitely use some consistency. Even in the Skyscale collection the difference between the hints for the scales and the eggs was disappointing for me doing the collections without a guide.
---
I love doing these collection without guides because I like looking around in places and corners that I'd have probably otherwise ignored. With their heavy use of these collections for acquiring so many items these days it would be nice to see the system get a bit of attention. Consistency in the hints would go a long way, but there are some other improvements that I'd love to see. I'd love to see a way to "activate" a collection so you have quick access to the hints from the main HUD instead of having to open the achievement panel every time. Then when the collection was active having some indicator of whether you're actually near the object or not. The karka hatchlings in LA was a fun example of this IMO. Just some indicator, audio or visual (or both for accessibility), that  let you know you were within some specific range of the item you're looking for.
---
Yes, it's a fucking moss covered branch. You can see it on a max zoomed out minimap
---
I think it's kinda cool at least in concept, it kinda looks like the human immune system forming a cyst or something. I'd wanna know the whole story before I got excited about a cyst though
---
...That I value my time for actually playing the game more than taking part in a glorified easter egg hunt that loops the same map no less than 3 times is a BS reason?
---
You truly are drunk.
---
I was just thinking yesterday how I wish this was an emote you could do when you have GS equipped.
---
You could either go to the place in the zone called mosswood, and check high on the branches in the northern part of that area, or you know go check the cliffs of the underworld because apparently that hint sucks.
---
I Wish the choice books gave out only unknown recipes in their lists, Once all unlocked you gain a random unknown recipe for its craft, e.g.  Sinister Armor Recipe Book - Unknown Tailor / Leatherworker / Armorsmith recipe. There is a total of 3497 recipes out there including bulk recipes (that gw2efficiency has listed) so it would take a while for anyone to unlock them all.

Unfortunately ANet are pushing hard for solo content instead of developing MMO game.
---
Yeah that would be pretty awesome.  It would be a shame for them to introduce the Olmakhan and then not do anything with their unique magic
---
The higher the tier the more people the server has online 24/7.
---
For example in t4-5 you can take your 3-4 best friends and flip the whole map at night, cuz theres literlaly no one playing.
---
I heard Thief doesn't feel good with Action Camera due to Shadowsteps being awkward.
---
Lishten?
---
depends on what metas you want to focus on for rewards or achievements/collections or if you want to do pure farm.
---
Melee classes with little to no AoE targetters are the ones that feel the best with action camera.
---
So power Warrior and Revenent (not Renegade) are the ones who feel the best.
---
While things like staff Elementalist and Scourge can feel awkward with Action Camera at first due to being ranged with many AoE ground targetters, they still work fine. I personally have played exclusively with Action Camera ever since it first came out since I also have a history with action MMOs, and it just makes the game feel so much more fluid.
---
I've also heard friends say that it can cause some FPS lag, but I never had that issue. Still worth noting if your friend has a very old PC.
---
Just wait for the WvW Alliance system coming soon^^TM.
---
The widget uses a few assumptions so that its looking at the most likely set of combinations, but yeah as the others said it uses live TP prices for calculations, and the number of slots and AR required haven't changed recently so there's no reason for it not to be accurate.

If you mean the gathering node mussels, this is from the wiki "Most nodes can be used by each character on an account and will reset (for that character) a few hours after gathering. "

&gt; Hello,
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I know you all have noticed the API breaking frequently recently and I wanted to write a post about it to help describe exactly what parts are breaking for clarity.
---
&gt;render.guildwars2.com is a piece of the API that converts game asset images into jpgs and pngs for the public to use in their apps and sites. It's backed by a pretty simple standalone piece of server software whose sole responsibility is to cache the assets, convert them, and serve them as images.
---
&gt;This server has been getting stuck in a bad state about every other month or so for a while now (I think a little over a year). It has been on my backlog of things to fix, but since the solution is a gentle reboot now-and-then, I admit I flagged it as low priority.
---
&gt;Over the last few weeks, for reasons I haven't yet figured out, it's been getting stuck very frequently, sometimes twice in a day and at least once every weekend. It's gotten so bad that due to server configuration reasons, it wiped the white list server which had to be recovered manually (which is why the item endpoint died recently). Thank you for your reports of failure on the forum. I have been using these reports to manually fix the server while we try to work on a real solution.
---
&gt;The priority for fixing render.guildwars2.com has been bumped up and is being actively worked on. The current status is debugging and gathering info on why it's breaking. As soon as we know, we'll fix it as soon as possible.
---
&gt;Thanks again for your reports, and thank you for your patience while we try to put out this fire for good.

Hiya, dirty\_huaraches! You found all the GW2 hints without guide, yes? You'll never consult outside guide, and are fine with the in-game hints, correct?
---
I remember when I first did this meta event two years ago and this happened LOL
---
I was utilizing the guide. My statement was saying I stumbled across that particular scale on my way to another site, without consulting the guide for that particular scale. Some reading comprehension might go a long way in trying to refute people, or in the very least not being drunk
---
I'm a returning player that just finished the story up to PoF. I'm interested in doing Fractals and Raids, but I'm un-sure what the rewards are? Why do people do Raids/Fractals if there isn't a gear progression? I currently have full Vipers ascended on my rev. Do I gain anything? I'm interested in the experience of them for the first time but, why would I do them again? What keeps people returning and doing raids weekly? Thanks in advance.
---
&gt;1. How does these armor stats work?
---
&gt;I mean i get the rare, exotic, ascended gear hierarchy but i cant understand the sigil and runes etc things i tried wiki but still so confusing. What should i put on armor and why it like showing multiple slots on it do i have to multiple same runes to get that attributes? Or how?
---
Other people have touched on it, but yep, you get more effects the more of the same rune you have equipped. So if you have one Superior Rune of the Scholar, you'd get +25 power. Two gives you +25 power and +35 ferocity (in total, not each), three gives you +75 power and +35 ferocity, and so on.
---
Now if you're talking about ascended items having extra slots, those slots are for infusions, which are small upgrade items that often grant agony resistance for surviving high level fractals, as well as sometimes extra stats. You usually don't need to worry about those unless you're either doing fractals at or past fractal 20 or are trying to super optimize your build (the stat boosts are only like +5).
---
If you're asking about which stats do what, power increases damage, precision increases critical chance, ferocity increases critical damage, vitality increases health, toughness increases damage reduction, condition damage increases...the damage your damaging conditions (burning/bleeding/poison/confusion/torment) do, expertise increases the duration of all of the conditions you apply, healing power increases how much healing you do, and concentration increases the duration of boons you grant.
---
&gt;2. If i put one runes, sigils on ascended gear can it be swapped to other attributes later ?
---
The gear? Yes, you can swap the gear's attributes by putting it in the Mystic Forge with an exotic insignia/inscription for the new stat set, 5 ectos, and an anthology of heroes (from Miyani, the Mystic Forge vendor). However, any runes/sigils/upgrades on it will be lost, since you're technically getting a new item. Legendary items can have their stats swapped at any time, without using the forge and without losing the upgrades in it.
---
If you're asking whether you can change out the runes and sigils, you can either just put new ones in, which overwrite the old ones (destroying them), or use an upgrade extractor first if you want to keep the old rune/sigil (usually you can get new runes/sigils for cheaper than buying an upgrade extractor, though).
---
&gt;3. Does this system works same on weapons?
---
Yep, just use an inscription in the Forge instead of an insignia.
---
&gt;4. How to know the combinations, should i put every different armor piece different stat or all pieces same ? Whats the best practice?
---
Usually you'd want to put all armor pieces as the same stat set. The main caveat I can think of is when you end up wanting to hit or not go over a certain cap. For instance, some builds take full Berserker's (power, precision, ferocity) except for a piece or two of Assassin's (precision, power, ferocity) to get enough precision to get to the ~70% critical chance needed to hit 100% with fury and certain buffs (usually ranger's spotter trait and the warrior's banner of discipline). Other builds might take mostly Harrier's (power, healing, concentration/boon duration), but with a few pieces of Magi's (healing, precision, vitality) so they don't waste any more boon duration than they need to have 100% uptime, same thing with certain chronomancer builds and having a mix of Berserker's and Diviner's (power, precision, concentration).
---
Buuuuut for most cases, you're probably best off going with one stat set for all pieces, usually Berserker's or Viper's (power, condition damage, precision, expertise/condition duration) for power or condition damage based builds, respectively. At least in PvE, most builds are based around doing as much damage as you can, and using dodges, healing, and other active defense (blocking, evading, moving out of the way, etc.) to survive if needed. 
---
For runes, many power builds use Superior Rune of the Scholar, which is good, but can be expensive and mainly shines when you are nearing ~70% critical chance (100% with fury and buffs) and can stay above 90% health most of the time. You'd probably be good with whatever rune, especially if it gives power. If you want to just get a full armor set with runes already included, search the TP for Nika's armor pieces (Nika's for medium armor, Zhed's/Devona's for light/heavy), which come with a set of infiltration runes, which are pretty nice (the other two weights' named Berserker's sets have different runes, which are also good, each giving power, but are more niche, with the light armor's centaur runes giving swiftness and the heavy armor's strength runes boosting the effects of might yet not providing might itself).
---
&gt;5. Your opinion best shortbow class ? And why? (Asking because i love chooka leggy i wish to do it one day)
---
There are only three classes that use shortbow right now, rangers, thieves, and the revenant elite specialization renegade, and all use them as mainly condition damage based weapons. I'm not entirely sure which is best, since I haven't used shortbow much on most of them, and even less on ranger, but I know thieves like to use it to tag/hit a bunch of enemies at once, since most of their other weapons are best for a single target or closely grouped enemies at melee range. You can try each class out and see which you like best, in fact you can see how they do at level 80 and with all specializations unlocked by going to the PvP lobby and fighting training NPCs. Either way, legendaries aren't soulbound, so you can switch them between your characters as much as you like.
---
&gt;6. I have like 80 Mystic forge stones should i try gambling with them to get a precursor? Is it worth ? Should i do it with exotic weapons to get precursor ? Or rare is enough?
---
I have no idea, personally. I know you need exotic weapons, at least, plus I don't think you need mystic forge stones, necessarily. Iirc, they're usually to take the place of another item in a mystic forge "recipe," so if you use a stone, you'd only need to put in three exotics instead of four. Now whether that's worth it is up to you. They're also great for making Mystic salvage kits, which are like master salvage kits with 250 charges, and come from putting a master, journeyman, and fine salvage kit in the Forge with 3 mystic forge stones.

&gt;7. Regarding legendary stuff better to get trinkets first or weapon? Whats more interesting to get ?
---
Honestly, I'm not sure...again. I don't have any legendaries yet, but I have done some of the legendary collections. The weapons and other legendaries (including the armor and trinkets) that have collections are more interesting than the newer legendary weapons that just require a bunch of "tributes/shards of X." If I'm going for looks, I'd start with weapons, since they're more varied in looks to choose from than the floating orbs of the trinkets. If I'm going for convenience, I might start with trinkets, since every character and every build can use them. You mentioned liking Chuka and Chumpawat, and at least the first collection (the only one I've done for it so far) is fun, plus I heard the others are too.
---
Sorry for the wall of text, I get rambly and overexplain sometimes. Hope it helps, though! Let me know if you've got any other questions.
---
I'm not clear, do you mean you wish more armors worked like orr's temple armors or that you wish Orr's temple armors worked like the Bladed armor does?
---
Dragonfall has this feature via scouts in camps.
---
And if the effect is that same as Aurora when equipped alone, what sense does that make thematically?
---
it's 20 per map. split into 10 from the map specific collections, and another 10 from each step in the meta achievement, each of which consists of a map's specific collection, just to be more specific 🙃
---
When that kid whines for his ball, the first time I talked to all the NPCs around him to see if this was indeed a thing. Anet can you maybe tie this into that location? Otherwise with 1500+ hours in gw2, i had no idea this was in game.
---
The actual host server is more important than tier IMO.  Generally though, the lower tiers are going to be less active.  That doesn't necessarily mean T1 is where all the fun is though.  T1 is plagued with omni-blob fights and skill lag.
---
Canthan jade is green.
---
Mursaat jade is purple.
---
I find sketches like these to be more interesting than the heavily colored and doctored art pieces.
---
They are going to fix this one pretty soon, since the new legendary trinket vision also requires you to get 6 of those weapons.
---
the grass is always greener on the other side. wait for alliances. (2023)
---
Does it? I thought it just required astral
---
For me it's timing issues with doppelganger, hounds is so quick that by the time I finish doppel it is already done, serpents ire happens after so ties in the chain of metas easier.
---
OMGOSH THIS LOOKS AMAZING! Great job!
---
It's fine. I either use dulfy or the community like tdgm's post or work together with friends.  Two heads, are, usually better than one.
---
" It solidifies VB's role in the expansion as well. VB now has an identity outside of "that place you pass through to get to the real maps" into the map where **you can get entire sets of armor cheaply and easily**."  
---
Can you remind me what armor sets you can get cheaply and easily in the HoT maps.  Its been too long.
---
It depends on the hassle they save me. I always tip. A teleport to friend normally gets 1g unless it's really hard to get to I may go 2 or 3g. Most I tipped was 5g for the Skyscale Blazeridge Steps one.  I think of it as they could be farming gold instead of helping me and they're saving me a lot of hassle. I made most of it back selling the free sausage thing you can use to call your Skyscale anyway. I mostly got to places or end of jump puzzles by myself and only teleported or portaled a few times. Saying this a tip has never been demanded.
---
Metas in large groups really aren't work. You can just show up and press 1 and if I was commanding I wouldn't even notice you. I'll be running PoF metas a lot with maybe some HoT metas thrown in for good measure, so feel free to just follow the tag and go to the maps we're in and press 1 for loot.
---
She looks awesome! Well done!
---
Gold, legendary gear, skins and cosmetic items, titles and achievements, getting new gear to make new builds, for fun, etc.
---
Um.. Bladed? That's the entire point of this thread
---
Bladed Armor is cheap and easy from VB.
---
It's now a legitimately great starting place for any newbies that want their first set of Viper's Gear.
---
Yes you need 6 astral weapons for Vision
---
[What yre you on about](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/a/a0/Dragon%27s_Jade_Reaver.jpg)?
---
It's probably the best source of stat-selectable exotic armor in the game.  It has every stat now, right? So, the first map that you invest in HoT for masteries also can earn you easy Berserker, Marauder, Minstrel, Givers, Diviners, Harriers or Vipers.  I remember crafting a lot of these early on in HoT &amp; PoF.  It wasn't easy or cheap to get a lot of these sets early on.  Really good quality of life change.
---
With the knowledge of the market and patience, yes, but more investment means more potential profit.
---
How does the [Hybrid Chrono](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/hybrid-chronomancer) fare in T4+100CM pugs with Firebrands being super popular and Renegades also popping up? I have a full setup that would work, just need to stat-swap the armor and all 3 weapons from Zerk+Leadership to Diviners+Eagle, but my Firebrand/Renegade (if I share gear, I also have an ascended GS/Scepter+Torch/Staff) are just two ascended armor pieces away from also having an entire set of ascended. 
---
I'm not really a fan of Firebrand's 'puke' style of play and haven't tried Renegade yet but it looks like Chrono is easier to play than it was a year ago and I'm wondering if they're worth investing into if I pug my dailies. Only downside is I don't know any of the map skips (but neither do most pugs)
---
Would if i could bud....
---
Unless you really dislike leveling... If you do, crating can get you a decent amount of XP.
---
All the gw2 hints? No since I havent completed every collection in the game, I'm apparently not qualified to answer that question given how you worded it. 
---
I do have basic reading comprehension skills and like, the slightest sense of intuition, so I was able to find your exhibit b.  I was able to realize that a moss covered wood means I should go to the area on the map called mosswood. I was fortunate enough to learn orienteering as a child, which covered the use a compass, so I knew to check the northern part of that area. I remember from biology that trees have branches, and trees are very tall, so I knew not to look on the ground. 
---
 I realize that knowing which way north is and knowing what branches are is asking lot from players because its assuming they have some real world knowledge.  I think that is really unfair, so you have a very justified frustration with that hint.
---
We don't know if it will have the same singular effect as either of those. For all we know Aurora/Vision could be sharing because they're both accessories.
---
Honestly one of two reason why I don’t play the Sylvari. 
---
The other one is their derpy standing position.
---
HoT didn't have mounts in mind and it was enjoyable imo. Going through the jungle and avoiding what you can and cannot bite. But after having the griffon, raptors, traversing is way faster, esp, at griffon max speed.
---
Tbh I think action cam works for almost everything. Problems only arise if you have some groundtarget skill as well as skills you need to aim and on enemies with a higher hitbox. I'm thinking the first raidboss in wing 6 who I have issues when I'm playing DH.
---
I really liked the challenge of navigating Maguuma without mounts. It was actually designed to feel difficult and dangerous. Mounts will make it much easier.
---
If you don't care about the story you could run PoF first and grab the mounts. The maps are way easier than HoT.
---
I'd suggest trying Verdant Brink (first HoT map) without mounts and if you feel it's too tedious you can still grab the mounts.
---
I can relate.
---
Done both power builds and they noth have their pros. I would say for PvE, Chrono is great since you can burst a lot twice. And maybe do phantasm build (unbelievably strong) and you get great group utilities and alacritt. 
---
For me I really enjoy Power Shatter Mirage and has been amazing so far PvE. Lots of stun breaks and clone generation/shatter (I think better than Chrono's). But you do lose a lot of group utility. Does great damage though.
---
Mount and glider make the game flat from an exploration view, you can jump from 10km and still be fine, no fall to the death, no searching for a way between 2 edges you just jump with raptor and so on ...
---
Yeah every stat, assuming you own PoF as well as HoT. It makes it so much easier for new players to gear up to lay their new elite specializations as well. And if they don't like how it's working out, they're just a map meta away from being able to re-do their armor.
---
I’d be cool with that, there hasn’t been a single Asura theme’d legendary so far, even this would be barely.
---
Hey, if you have a free character slot, you can try to contact support to ask if they can undelete your first character. Don't expect fast response because they having more request than usual.
---
They can't always do it, but it worth the try.
---
yay thanks!
---
I just checked it out, this site is amazing... I can't believe some of the stats people have.
---
Thank you so much!
---
yay great, will do :)
---
Is there any good source for trinkets?
---
Did you report it as a bug? I did as well.
---
wow okay, deal! easy decision then :)
---
omg yeah, thanks, not for me atm then!
---
cool thanks! i can still purchase PoF should I not like it, though I doubt that :), not sure how quickly one gets a mount there though
---
During these kinds of big in-game events, can people pop buffs and have then have them stack? 
---
I used to play Marvel Heroes and, before it was nerfed, you could call out and gather a group of people and everyone would pop their buffs/boosts/boons. I ended up having 21days (in-game) of XP boosts. Am curious if that's a possibility in GW2?
---
i think i should experience it without mounts then? to see what it is like and later reveal the whole mount aspect of the game?
---
you'll get your first mount, the raptor, during the very first story instance, so your exposure to spoilers is limited.
---
thanks will do! is HoT a long expansion i.e. if you compare a newbie levelling from 1 to 80, how long does HoT take at an enjoyable regular pace?
---
good! thanks :)
---
But the pocket raptors!!!!!!!!
---
I will say that many of the mounts invalidate many of the masteries (especially the early ones) that it will feel more like a slog if you grab the bunny then do HoT (but that is a little bit in PoF).
---
It depends.  I think if you're in an active, communicative and semi-organized map it's fine to play without mounts.  
---
However, more often than not many of the Heart of Thorns maps become active within about [30-45m of an approaching meta.] 
---
(https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers)  If you're playing outside of such windows then having mounts like the Springer with high-jump or a raptor with canyon jumping can come in handy for general exploration purposes vs. stonewalled events and areas locked behind vines or maybe leyline gliding.  
---
The main thing you need to get used to with regard to HoT &amp; PoF is using the LFG in the contact menu to taxi yourself into active, populated maps that are organizing for one purpose or another.  Whether this is for HP trains or timer based meta-events you'll have a better time in the expansion maps if you make a habit of keeping tabs on what's going on and organizing via the GW2 LFG.
---
b&amp; for exploits
---
Auric Basin after other people completed it, VB as night time boss time hits. Dragon Fall meta's. Raids.
---
Interesting, you must play outside NA prime (the only time I get to play) because I've found there are usually one to two commanders per map minimum  to follow during that time. 
---
Though I think all servers suffer from this, the cause may be it being summer. People go on holidays or have other activities they partake in. My WvW guild suffers from both more new blood and less old guard in the summer.
---
Once again, while it sucks it's happening, at least we now know why it's happening- and that it's at least being looked at.
---
Thanks :)
---
Rifle Deadeye and Ele are only good when you have some form of distraction, they are literally the squishiest PvE classes. Would not recommend.
---
Necro and Ranger are BY FAR the optimal solo PvE classes.
---
Suit up in power gear for a start, deadeye is a long range rifle sniper. And yes you are naturally squishy. Get good and evade stuff or kill mobs fast
---
practice practice practice!
---
Also, what traits and skills are you using? Valkyrie is fine for some builds, but it suffers if you don't have any natural crit chance because the gear itself doesn't give you any.
---
They had it up for a week or so. It was good fun.
---
Why can't you smoke normal speed like the rest of us? Always going for that fancy supersperd ze ze ze.
---
I meant exotics, any easy equivalent stat selection trinkets like bladed, I don't want to jump into ascended just to try builds that might not work well.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki
---
Check out the standards if you find yourself playing alone alot. I finally caved and followed some suggestions for my Elementalist, Mesmer and Necro.. and I've gotta say I can slice through melted butter much easier now
---
Yeah it always brings back awesome memories. Between times at Tequatl and then Triple Trouble there was a lot of fun times to be had.
---
Still remember someone telling me about the easter egg and the chills it gave me. Was an incredible honor considering all the great people involved.
---
Yeah the griffon is considered a "Prestige" mount along with the skyscale, meaning it takes quite a bit more work than the others
---
Edit: Omit the ascended gear for Exotic gear and often there are varied runes/sigils you can explore too.
---
Do everything in order.
---
Thank you for sharing. This looks helpful for determining activity level or coverage for each time time zone. 
---
Yak's Bend is 5th at best during EU and NA EST times, and then falls to 8th for NA PST. Anvil Rock, Northern Shiverpeaks, Blackgate, and Henge of Denravi seem to be the most active overall, with coverage in all time zones.
---
Different ticket types will be guaranteed to have different queue times. They likely have specific people dedicated to certain queues too and so some may have more resources than others.
---
You have to be level 80 and have the base story done before you can even go to maguuma i believe
---
Anything works in casual groups. It's obviously a waste to play chrono with either fb or renegade, but otherwise it works fine.
---
Considering that casual groups rarely have meta builds, especially meta group compositions, you'll be fine on any support.
---
This is too much math for me. ._.
---
I just used the mentioned "cost efficient way" on the wiki with 2x7 8x8 and 8x9.
---
No but, honestly, you don't have to worry about jumping to ascended. If you're doing meta builds, you're basically only going to be setting them to Berserker, Viper, Harrier, or Diviner. If you're not going for meta builds, you can always keep them around in case you want to try them out on another character or you can salvage them for materials that are useful in other parts of the game like Fractals.
---
Ah, I see you too appreciate the Seer headband.
---
Bad idea to invest into it then, considering I see one or two firebrands every time I pug? Spec is insanely popular and why i considered going rene so I'd stop having to swap to DH
---
It means vanilla in Italian :P
---
Thanks :D
---
Thank you!
---
When you put all 5 together, your character opens a portal and loads into GW3.
---
Here is what I did with my account, I leveled 1 heavy-class and 1 other class simultaneously. On heavy class, in your case is the Guardian, I picked weaponsmith  profession to get those sharpening tools. And on my other class,  this is either Necro or Thief, I picked the chef profession for foods. Now if your planning to buy the expansion in the future there you can decide for 3 more classes to level, 2 of which can be boosted. The reason for Necro or Thief is that both of them are safe to level. No hassle at all. Just go minions on Necro and p/p on thief. Hope this helps you.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Your venom is a useless utility. Condis scale on condi damage, and you currently dont have any.
---
In open world I would just suggest picking up a Nika's (Berserker's set) off TP and you'll kill things fast enough you rarely would need to kite. As someone mentioned, Invigorating Precision in Crit strikes is really good for survival if you need to go melee, but you need high precision for that to work.
---
Typically if I play Deadeye (rifle) in open world, would take DA 1-3-3 or 2-3-3, Crit Strikes 3-2-3 or 3-2-1, Deadeye 1-3-1 or 1-1-1.
---
If you wanna slap on daggers, you can do pretty similarly. 
---
Hide in Shadows for heal, any mobility, stealth, utilities will work well for Rifle. Shadowstep, Roll for initiative, Blinding Powder, Shadow Gust, Shadow Meld elite come to mind. Raid build uses Assassin's Signet and Mercy so I just use that but its w/e in open world.
---
Awesome! I think I speak for all when I say that this info is greatly appreciated!
---
As long them item isn't part of an elite spec collection. *Yes, now you can select harrier in a level 30 shoes*
---
I got a friend of mine to try it again this weekend, and he is beyond excited to play!
---
It has been very cool to see the game through his experiences. It gives it new life. Mind you, he also played F2P for a few weeks. The second he set foot into Elonia he was floored. He likes Tyria, but he was in utter awe of the PoF stuff so far. I can't wait for him to see the end of Heart of Thorns with the Meta!
---
It’s dead everywhere.
---
Low toxicity, in pvp, lol :P
---
No idea what any of that means, but considering how great the websites and tools the community has come up with thanks to API stuff, I'm happy to see it getting more support, thanks, Anet and community \^\_\^
---
The aesthetic fits fantasy settings quite nicely as you could imagine it as part of a journal entry or the like. The impossibly perfect look is more suitable for sci-fi settings in my opinion.
---
I just crashed like 5 minutes ago with the same error code, can't log in with any of my characters. Hopefully it'll work again in a few minutes
---
idgi is the dude talking to himself or s/t? logging in and out of two different characters?
---
Can I somehow "redo" some achievements in Dragonfall in order to get a new Mist Shard box?  I completed (3) of the War Eternal achievements so far using light armor character 1.  As a result, I got, for example, a [Mist Shard Shoulders Box](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Shard_Shoulders_Box).  Trouble is, I've got a Medium armored Engineer now which I'm trying to obtain exotic Diviner's gear for.  Can I somehow re-acquire this armor box?  I feel like the answer is probably no, but figured I'd ask.  Otherwise, what's the cheapest and/or easiest method for obtaining a Diviner's set for my Engineer?
---
jesus christ
---
A dataset of one is really not something you can draw conclusions on. What was your ticket about? Different problems are probably sorted differently. People having trouble accessing their accounts are apparently taking longer because those issues take longer to check. Without knowing your issue, hard to say.
---
Also, did you get an email from support saying they received the complaint?
---
Come, come! Quality armor big shiny! Big shiny equals big joy! SKRITT MATH!
---
The most common ones are ARC Dps meters and templates, YOLO mouse, and TACO route packages. Their may be more, but that's all I can think of at the moment.
---
Also make sure to take advantage of great tools like [gw2efficiency.com](https://gw2efficiency.com), [gw2bltc.com](https://gw2bltc.com), and metabattle.com.
---
No no no, we have to get to the armory!
---
There are no effective ways to earn exotic trinkets allowing for stat selection.
---
I started playing Memorial Day weekend, and I’m having a great time. I’ve only got a lvl 35 engineer, but it’s going pretty well so far
---
i play other titles (pso2,ragnarok,wow,ffxiv) but gw2 is the only one of those that give me heavy problems with fps. very high demanding games i dont play them on pc, if its on console i prefer to play them on console so my main focus is to find something afordable that will let me play gw2 with decent fps, not necesarily max. i though i would spend at the least 300 on the cpu and gpu but i searched and think those two would do just the trick by a much more reasonable price, not even going above the 200$ gate, but sure, im open to more suggestions :)
---
Fort Aspenwood!
---
Yes - it is coming in handy for me now since certain alts have certain maps unlocked, in my case
---
From what I heard though, you need to go to Gorrik with the character that started the collection. They get the updates/etc, even though other alts can collect. :)
---
