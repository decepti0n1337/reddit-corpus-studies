Power Mirage is something that already exists within the game in PvP and Open world. It was very popular season 9ish in PvP.   
---

---
Asking for it to have a viable option in raids and fracs isn't a stretch.
---
---
---
As a main Guardian as well, I can relate to all those problems. specially as a DH main, people think just because of the blocks, we have high sustain but what they don't see (or rather read) Aegis only blocks next incoming attack and that for current meta means absolutely nothing due multihitting skills (warr GS2, thief dagger storm, ranger LB2, mesmer GS1 or Staff 2...) even the less when now there are traits/skills that makes attacks unblockable (which for my F3 is horrible)
---
Imo, I would rather say, buff by 2k lower pool and maybe 1k mid pool so hp classes to be like:
---
Low pool: 13,6k
---
Mid pool: 16,4k
---
High pool: 19,2k
---
Condi Mirage excels because the traits, utility skills, and weapon skills that Mirage adds to the class mostly focus on condi. It's clearly designed as a condi spec. But additionally, yes you're right, the fact that clones are designed to deal no power damage but still apply conditions is a feature of the Mesmer class at its core and Mirage leverages that to great effect.
---
I like to imagine that in lore, the Chrono elite spec mentor would give up trying to keep up with his class changes and respec to Mirage.
---
Ele can still be super tanky and at least on the golem it's still top dps… so... no?
---
Yeah, all those [damage](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) nerfs really destroyed Ele dps.
---
Ele has consistently always been at the top. If anything they need even more nerfs to bring them in line with other DPS specs. If ele gained more HP they would need quite a big dps nerf to compensate for the HP gain.
---
you can say the same for the build "healer soulbeast". people always say "just go druid" but clearly anet meant for healer soulbeast to be a thing, why would they introduce supportive type pets otherwise? healer soulbeast not being viable is a problem
---
because he said so.
---
1. condi reaper also existed. It used to be much stronger than power reaper in spite of reaper always being designed as a power spec.
---
2. There are a lot of spec-stat combos that are great in PvP and trash in PvP. Both game modes are very different. Spellbreaker is almost entirely useless in raids and yet is very strong PvP (and WvW) . Asking for a spec to be strong in one because it is or was in the other is absurd.
---
&gt; such as the ley lines eithout filters
---
I always thought that ley lines were the least contaminated if not the purest form of magic. Kralkatorrik became insane because he ate other ED magic (which started eons ago).
---
&gt; expansion of the barrier system
---
Not just barrier, keep expanding buffs in general. It opens up more playstyles and less restrictions. There is a reason why support Chrono was the most dominant support in the game *for years*.
---
so does hammer warrior.
---
Its meta in pvp 🙄
---
Look into power chrono. Some specs are built to have a bit of bias in efficiency in certain areas.
---
Ele/weaver doesn't need more nerfs, for what it does it is in a good spot in damage right now, with a challenging/punishing rotation little addition to a team except pure damage
---
I'm asking for a role, it doesn't have to be DPS but would probably make the most sense to be.  
---
Power Mirage has 0 options.
---
Can u get viper stats tho with dragonfall?
---
The only thing Mirage directly adds to condi specs apart from axe being traited is the diffrence between illusion quality as a condi spec, which yes existed since launch. But I'd hardly consider mesmer a "Condi class" when power builds existed long before.
---
Might be OP but if A-net added a trait where in PvE infinite horizon, apply 100% of mes damage so it's an auto attack spam fest from illusions, and did max ambush damage we'd see previlence simply by taking the equivalent lines adjacent to dueling and illusions but in power.
---
apart form axe applying condis there is nothing else that really says mirage is innately condi.
---
This could be remedied by giving power a way to scale illusions in same way condi does.
---
I was moaning just the other day when the Prologue came out, I use the wiki, but some things like collections, Season 3/4 backpacks  i just preferred the presentation at Dulfy and extra tips below the line.
---
Great job OP! maybe think about the ArenaNet Partner Program further down the line?
---
Power mirage is not a spec. Mirage is a spec. Mirage has an option: Condi mirage.
---
It's actually meta in 4(i think?) raidencounters. That is on top of other mesmer builds that are meta. Enge doesnt have any meta spec on any encounter - thats much more of a problem (but it isnt really, because condi holo is good enough on many).
---
She just straight up might not want to.
---
I get the feeling she's perfectly content where she's at, which is fair. People know her name already, and she's slowly gain popularity through word of mouth without really any extra effort than what she already puts in.
---
It's a pretty comfortable spot for someone who, I assume, is just doing it as a side hobby. There's also extra stress from being as well known and integral to the community as Dulfy was. For example Ayinmaiden could just stop one day and only a few people would start asking questions, Dulfy doesn't have the luxury as we can see by how often people ask about her, and how for some people "she's busy" isn't a good enough answer.
---
Savor that feeling while it lasts, OP.
---
Can you even think? Mirage has absolutely 0.0 power traits in its traitline, the most important power mainhand weapon(sword) has a terrible ambush skill for pve and that is fine. The spec is specifically designed for condition damage and you can play it power for sure, but its not gonna be good, will probably hang around 26k on golem endnumber. Also viper is really easy to get with the stat selection rework.
---
You can use the open-world guides on [metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World) instead if you prefer reading about builds
---
Please name an ambush skill associated with a power weapon that  procs damaging condis?
---
By that logic mesmer on a whole including chrono is a condi spec.  Scepter, staff, and axe all have condis in their autos so it makes sense that their ambushes will also have condis. This doesn't mean it can't be remedied for power.
---
Well normally you farm with every char and Not just 1^^
---
Okay so then ban DPS meters then, cuz every group I join is insta kick with them saying it's not.
---
Also frankly after the chrono changes I'm not feeling it anymore. If it's good enough why does no one else see it that way?
---
I remember people claiming that mounts would take away the scenery or something like that, but now I rarely touch a waypoint. Feels more immersive imo.
---
Perhaps They need to make the maps more interactive, Did you read the rest or did I loose you when I Expressed my love for Edge of the mists? You know whats a shit map? Eternal battlegrounds, its boring with little going on and no interactive gameplay. The points mean squat as does winning, I went over all of this later in the post so Id suggest reading the rest if its at all possible for you.
---
Yara it is then
---
Mirage axe and utility skills enable it to be a good condi class. Just because they don't do condi damage on their own doesn't mean they don't increase the ability for mirage to stack conditions. It is clearly a condition spec and to deny that is just naive or stubborn.
---
You can get any stat combination on any piece of equipment that allows selection of stats. They updated all the items because there were huge inconsistencies. That was like 3? months ago
---
So, because we assume they see themselves as cats, then they must go RAH instead of PARE?
---
Maybe so, but my point being that the prejudice is either unfair or easily remedied.  
---
Simply buffing clones so they scale with power while slotting mirage would make it viable and there isn't any reason not to do it other than intentionally limiting it from being playable.
---
Should clarify if you're EU or NA
---
No, they must go "RAH" because that's how the word "imperator" is actually pronounced.
---
Because they feel different, particularly after taking away 4th shatter and distortion.
---
No it's not.
---
Yeah core areas are pretty easy, but areas after HoT are pretty fun for me. Challenging is relative I guess
---
It's because it's a Charr Imperator, not a Roman imperator.
---
I just googled https://www.google.com/search?q=imperator&amp;oq=imperator&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1486j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8
---
And it goes "EM-PURR-RAH-tur"
---
Edit: Or rather impəˈrädər,ˌimpəˈräˌtôr/

1 utility is the only real difference were they to make illusions scale with power.

Yes it is:

[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imperator](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imperator)
---
I think that it's a good start! Agree with others that you shouldn't try to be Dulfy. Be you and apply your own style!
---
Agree with others that the background needs to either be changed (not a huge fan of the image currently being used), or fixed so that the scroll works. 
---
I think a new logo would be nice, not a huge fan of the current one or the "all for fans" - as someone else pointed out, it sounds too much like the merch site (the for fans by fans one). 
---
I also think the two panels in the main body should either be moved elsewhere or removed. I don't like that it pushes all the text to the right and it's not something I'd probably want access to when reading the guide. Maybe add them as navigational links instead. 
---
I think the overall instructions are pretty good, but agree with others that the headings need to be fixed, since it can get confusing to look at (including the underlined text). There are lots of typos - It would be worth having someone go over the page and just correct those!
---
We got it done, thanks!

You still get my upvote /u/StormyTDragon
---
No it isn't
---
I wasn't. But I could have specified that I don't mean all maps. I tend to avoid dailies in core maps due to the lack of difficulty, but other maps are pretty fun. I'll admit I'm not a master of any class by any means.
---
All of the Charr titles (legionnaire, centurion, tribune, imperator) are from the Roman titles.
---
That was delightful to read. Thank *you*
---
7 years later we still can't play as a party or set up custom lobbies for guilds... in a mmo.
---
Those lips aren't doing much for us cats brah :/
---
I think the problem with ele is that either you build an openwolrd / solo build and do good damage in line with other classes and still remain tanky.
---
Either you play full meta build WITH support. The best you can do with weaver is to maintain 25 might and fury with weaver alone. And it suffers more for lack of supoor than other classes. Like guard with self quickness can be quite bursty without help.
---
Chrono has totally insane self burst. Some condi builds have good self sustain DPS. If you play close to meta build and be by yourself you can reach quite nice burst but with ele it is much harder and it requires more theory crafting and off meta builds and on top of that with meta build you are indeed squishy. Lose lose situation. 
---
I think this because this awkward spot that people think ele is too squishy.
---
It's not Latin tho. Believe me, I'm someone who gets pissed when they see badly-translated Latinate char names like "Xxobitum dominae suaeXx" (No, that doesn't make sense in Latin), but expecting a *fantasy* race, which while Romanesque is not fully *equal* to Rome, to pronounce everything as the Romans did... is a bit much.

---
&gt; Power Mirage needs to be brought in line with it's surviability to at least the level of thief in PvP, and be made viable for Raids.
---
Why?
---
I have no experience in website editing of any kind but I can edit the wiki. It's really easy. I just find a page I want mine to look like and copy/paste and enter the data for the content.
---
Hold on there, you've just ignored most of my reply. You've said that mirage has no inherent condi traits, and I've just pointed them all out. I think that deserves some kind of response.
---
So here's the thing with the healer. You're missing the connection here. You are saying that something with no inherent healing skills shouldn't be reworked to a healer. But mirage has no inherent power dps traits or skills, but you are asking for it to be reworked for power dps. That is why they are the same. Can you explain to me how those two are not the same? Maybe point out some mirage traits that are inherently power dps oriented to show me why you think that reworking for power dps is okay, but not for healing?
---
You're right that clones are less useful on power specs, but if you compare to dps chrono, a power mesmer dps build that is very strong (and wouldn't get you kicked from raids or fractals), the power build gets much more value out of phantasms than the condi build. That is just how mesmer works. Power gets more from phantasms, condi gets more from clones.
---
And again, like I said before, you keep saying that it's something that is easy to fix. The first thing to note is that balance is never as easy as we might think it is as players. The second thing is that you still haven't given a reason WHY it needs to be fixed in the first place, and I think you can probably tell from most of the replies you're getting, just because you think that mirage should have a power option isn't really a good enough reason to sell it for most people.
---
Also, the infusion slots allows for more stats, which objectively makes Ascended/Legendary the BiS gear.
---
this shit is exactly what I expect from people with this hairstyle on their charr
---
Awesome! Thank you. It has been hard for me to achievement hunt without Dulfy. I've bookmarked your website.
---
My first suggestion would be to delete the gw2 cache in %TEMP% on windows (sounds like you did).  
---
If that doesn’t fix it then I’d launch the client in repair mode.  
---
And if that didn’t work then a fresh (re)install of the game.
---
And if that doesn’t work then I’m not sure I’d know where to go next other than support.
---
what the fuck cunt
---
True. I love achievement hunting, but the feeling that I HAVE to grind out as much of an unfun activity as I possibly can while it's live kills a lot of my motivation. I did one round for the daily and decided I'm just not gonna get that AP.

Don't farm Luck on purpose IMO, game will shower you with it constantly. 
---
-use it when you get it (salvaging etc)
---
-get an ascended amulet and put a Magic Find enrichment on it
---
-keep up a free 24h Guild Magic Find enhancement from your guild hall NPC
---
-when not doing intense things, use magic find food (I like pumpkin cookies for condi and dragonfly cupcakes for power) and utilities (I like the halloween claw sharpening skull or whatever it's called, for all specs), both of which are cheap as dirt. 
---
-people drop banners EVERYWHERE nowadays, it's awesome. Keep up your buffs from those (if there are none in sight, check your home borderland in wvw, or the spawn point in dragonfall).
---
It'd be nice if they'd at least throw in an NPC on the opposing team so you can at least play.
---
When you say use at own risks, what are some potential risks in using this?
---
Yes, the warbeast, sorry. But I was just trying to make the oiled hardened and I have 2 oiled components made and ready to go. They just don't show up on the discovery pane and as far as I can tell they aren't in the regular crafting list either, which makes sense as I've never used them before.
---
[Princess](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Princess)

Except for specialization collection weapons.
---
Then leave :)
---
Still works and indeed makes whole golden challenge easier.
---
I think it would be awesome if a class can fit every role, but not every elite spec. Mirage tho is pretty weak in pve, I wouldn’t mind more fun condi stuff on it besides confusion.

The standard glass cannon build for Fractal Weaver would work(either berserker for power or Viper's for Condition).  
---
The trick to not dying on your weaver is usually dependent on how you'd time your skills with your dodges, there's some skills on your set that will lock you into an animation that sometimes ends up with you getting chunked or getting downed.  
---
  
---
You can also swap your dagger out for Focus.  
---
Focus Earth 5 is a really good Invuln(not sure about the duration) - But it helps with getting more hits in on your target.  
---
Lava Skin(Earth + Fire 3) will give you some extra health in terms of the barrier that it gives.  
---
Earthen Vortex(Sword Earth 2) is a 1/2 second dodge(just correct me if I'm wrong) is a really wonderful dodge if you time it right.  
---
Water Signet makes up for some sustained self healing, though not a lot, through constantly swapping attunements and using your weapon skills.  
---
Your Mixed Element skills(3 on any 2 attunements) if traited right, will give you a small amount of barrier, it usually makes a difference from being a weaver on the floor, or a weaver that's standing and fighting.  
---
Be aware of skills that can put you into an animation lock, these usually root you into place.  
---
The ones that I can come up off the top of my head would be :  
---
Flame Uprising(Sword Fire 2) and Rust Frenzy(Sword Earth 3 - Double Attune to Earth).
---
Lemongrass Poultry Soup. Actually eat for the encounter/enviroment instead of just going for the META.
---
&gt;Do you know of any popular MMOs with less vertical progression than this one? I can't

Ley lines are unfiltered "all types of magic combined". They're a pure form of magic, but pure, unfiltered magic is dangerous.
---
Eating other Elder Dragon magic didn't begin to be a thing until Zhaitan's death, but Kralkatorrik's Torment long predates that. The only thing - that we know of - that could cause torment via conflicting energies would be the ley lines that all the Elder Dragons eat off of primarily (except, potentially, Zhaitan).

Tested it, certainly seeing improvements. Goes to show just how much work needs to be done with this game to bring it up to modern standards. They need to give us native DX12 support.

Warbeast armor requires a recipe to craft; it isn’t discoverable, so if you can’t find it in the crafting panel then you haven’t consumed the recipe. Recipe are listed on the Trading Post as [Recipe: Harrier’s Warbeast (Armor)] and in the crafting panel they’re simply listed as Warbeast (Armor).

I am bored to death with GW2...
---
Because I have been playing it almost everyday for 7 fucking years. Every time I get so fed up, I tried other mmos - I've subbed them all, ESO, FFXIV, ESO, WOW, you name it. And after a month (in some cases, many months), I just can't.... I can't go back to idiotic gear grind and RNG bullshits in other mmos. I remember grinding sets in ESO and I think I lost half my lifespan just from the frustration. There are many things that other games do better than GW2 but considering the most essential that break or make my attention, GW2 does it best. The idea of playing an mmorpg without having to take it as a second job, can you imagine.
---
[There's an ambient conversation between a Blood Legion guard and an asuran merchant that makes this painfully clear.](https://youtu.be/z-rmcHKJ3WA?t=169)
---
A lot of the ambient conversations make it clear that outsiders aren't really welcome there, even if they were invited. It really makes much more sense that there aren't any banking agents, trading post agents, etc.
---
I think it doesn't count each character but rather each account.
---
This is from someone playing for 4 months.
---
The open world content is quite varied if you have the expansions. Between masteries, elite specs, ascended gear, achievements and story, there are a lot of things to keep you occupied. There are quite a few maps, so I don't feel bored at all (except if I want to farm some map-specific currency like Winterberries, but that's not required - I just wanted some Ascended trinkets faster). 
---
I don't feel like gold is a pressing issue either, most things will give you some gold or good things to sell. Of course, there are more expensive things like the griffon or legendaries, but those are more QoL things.
---
So, all in all, there is some grind, but it feels less so, with the quantity and variety of open-world things to do. And you always have Fractals and Raids as well (though I haven't been doing much of either).
---
So then you're having your paid employees doing regular code review on a third party project whose release schedule is entirely unrelated to yours.
---
Just because a few elitist adult babies decide to throw a tantrum and say they’re going to quit the game, but then never actually leave, like the addicts they are, doesn’t mean the rest of us are going anywhere. And the community has already proven that when one person we rely on for guides is unable or unwilling to make a guide for new content, we can band together to make pretty solid guides.

Question is how long time period is "all" (a month? a week? all playtime)
---
Last time I tried to play pvp I basically saw same 10 people being shuffled around over and over and over (and it was kinda -- if these two high ranking players on our team it's 500-100, on their team -- 100-500). But it's been a while...
---
Yeah. So OP has at least 6 accounts. That's not unreasonable. I have 4 bank guilds, in which the only members are my own 11 accounts.
---
I think there is a balance to it. Some maps feels way too waypointy, where everyone just mass WPs constantly. Then there are other maps that have a nice balance of WP to reset a train, but mostly mount and on foot travel to get from event to event.
---
You seem to be forgetting amnoon, all of elona, cantha and probaly some more areas.
---
Because that's how the word is pronounced these days in the US where Anet is. Not a difficult concept to understand. I don't complain when I play a game and I see words spelled like "colour" or "centre" because I know the whole world isn't just the one place I live in.

There are three main ways to unlock a crafting recipe:
---
1. Automatically when you reach the required crafting level
---
2. Discovering the recipe through the discovery tab
---
3. Consuming a recipe item
---
Usually, you cannot discover a recipe that is available as an item to consume, so if you've only done discovery before, you're missing out on... a lot of recipes!
---
The final step in producing a piece of Warbeast armor requires obtaining and consuming a recipe item with that specific armor piece's name. For example, the medium armor Warbeast coat requires [Recipe: Harrier's Warbeast Jerkin.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Recipe:_Harrier%27s_Warbeast_Jerkin) This can be obtained from the Trading Post for a few gold.
---
After you consume the recipe item, you still cannot put the components together via the Discovery tab; you must find the recipe in the main crafting list (try typing "Warbeast" into the search bar at the top of the list). It doesn't matter if it's your first time using that recipe or not; consumable recipes don't have a special requirement for the first time you use them.
---
Just to be sure, the recipe for Warbeast armor requires specific 'oiled' components, not the generic "Oiled Hardened" components. The two pieces you need are [Warbeast Hardened Longcoat Padding](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warbeast_Hardened_Longcoat_Padding) and [Warbeast Hardened Longcoat Panel.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warbeast_Hardened_Longcoat_Panel) The recipes for these components are obtained automatically, so they will be in the main crafting list as well.
---
Also, even if you have made the wrong components, you can sell them on the Trading Post to get some of your gold back - don't toss them away! You can buy the Warbeast components on the Trading Post as well.
---
WvW and PvP balance rule this game.
---
You'll notice all drastic gameplay and numbers chanegs are WvW/PvP driven. Completely ruins the game for PvE players.

Been waiting for power revenant to be a thing, but courtesy of PvP that will never happen.

---
Agree and disagree. I generally like it, but once you've completed it it's completely dull. I wish masteries were character bound not account bound. If I take a new character into the heart of Maguuma, it doesn't make sense that they'd already be glider masters. They are mount masteres without having to get familiar with the mounts. 
---
I just wish the xp requirement was less steep, but to make it fair you'd have to complete it on every character.
---
Also I wish there were more core masteries, because at this point I kinda already forgot that there even are core masteries.
---
I think hp is good how it is.
---
If you buff low health professions, you have to increase dmg of high health professions.
---
Like Necro would need huge dmg buff as well as more survivability added (blocks,evades, invulns)
---
And some low health professions would need their survivability tuned down by a huge junk, like guard loose some blocks, thief loose some stealth and mobility/evades, ele loose sustain (healing/evades)
---
Well, before we got into expansions area, that's how humans were described. Not to mention, you don't play Elonians or Canthans. You play as Krytans. As for Cantha, we really have no idea what's going there and prior to season 4, there wasn't a human nation in Elona. It was an Awakened nation that had humans subjugated. 
---
OK, well, I guess either way I stand corrected. Still, again, in real life examples, not all human cultures or civilizations use the same level of technology despite it being a widespread thing. We still have tribal humans living in mud huts and hunting and gathering with crude instruments.
---
Just because Charr modernized and sparked the inudstrial revolution, that doesn't mean every race has to follow suit. Look at the Olmakhan. Charr, clearly not technological. And they split from the same Charr that did get techy.
---
All Asura use tech but they're assholes. And very likely, their tech is designed to be used by them and only them. Unless you're some genius from another race.
---
Sylvari themselves prefer nature to technology just as much as they, for the most part, prefer grown armor rather than metal armor.
---
And as for Norn, well, similar to the Olmakhan, they have their ways and they don't seem bent on altering them as a species. Sure, individuals here and there could operate technology but it's not a part of their society.
---
Tombs man...tombs!!!
---
To be fair, if the mounts would just function as a run speed buff like in most other MMO's, it would have killed the scenery. But thanks to how Arena Net implemented them, people actually need to observe the maps to find cool synergies. For example: I've never looked up to find platforms I could jump or fly to with my mounts, before they were a thing. I also would take great detours to get around water. Same in other MMO's. But in GW2, I can embrace the mapdesign and constantly find new ways to get around thanks to mounts.
---
No change to health for core classes IMO, as people playing their classes have adapted both class strengths and weaknesses. It would be okay if this was close to launch, but I don't think its needed now. Plus there is a balance concern and changing the health pool of a class may lead to some unforeseen consequences. For one a roamer with a suddenly higher vitality can now slot more Zerker gear to have the same effective health as before but with more damage.
---
That being said, we can have health adjustments for newer elite specs, as newer elite specs offer new ways of playstyle that people would need to adjust to and one that is balanced with the health change in mind. For instance, they can try something like lowering a new Necro spec's health and giving them more active defense such as blocks, evades or invuls.
---
they use line of sight, the triangle is just a graphic to indicate the "zone" it can trigger in, walls and objects will block it
---
You can slap nomad gear on every class and say it's super tanky. Golem has nothing to do with actual performance.
---
If you are talking about PvE, how would increased health compensate for damage loss?
---
I think blinding the troll while its alive works. If its dead and the launch AoE is still there, tough luck.
---
Are you ignoring the facts that most chrono and staff ele nerfs were caused by pve, but affected wvw a lot? And that's just 2 examples I can think of at the moment.
---
Balance doesn't rule this game to begin with and neither do pvp and wvw.
---
They are the ultimate time wasters
---
This makes me wonder...perhaps the eating of other ED magic started BEFORE this awakening cycle. The ED existed, and they've been in a cycle of corrupting and devouring magic before going to sleep. They're needed to keep Tyria afloat as part of a magical cycle, we know that much. But their intelligence gives hint to that they were something more before they got corrupted. Perhaps there weren't just 6 EDs in the past, and the civilization in the original cycle killed one/multiple, causing the corruption?
---
I have already asked them because It has been 2 years since I started gw2 ytb channel. But Anet hasn't answered so far.
---
And after that we get a new expansion: Guild Wars 2 - Charr Politic Simulator.
---
Yeah and you brits drive me nuts by making every A at the end of a word sound like an R. AmeriKER. Or WP saying DARBY rather than DERBY. 
---
(I'm not being serious)
---
Keep these type of posts coming. Brings a smile to my face.
---
You can still buy a G600, but if you dare opening yours and fixing the problem yourself, this could also help:
---
https://www.instructables.com/id/Repair-mouse-with-double-click-problem/
---
Another possibility would be to disable too-fast double-clicks using something like auto hotkey. This is just a workaround, but does not involve opening the mouse.
---
PvP'ers cried rivers about bunker chrono and roaming pvp chrono, which led to the gutting of continuum split as well as phantasm builds alongside ether signet.
---
Staff ele for a long time in WvW was a staple. The only format staff ele was not a top tier pick was spvp . Staff ele saw plenty of play in GvG. Just because it isn't a necromancer doesn't mean it wasn't meta. GWEN in WvW being a thing for a reason. Necro just thrives because someone has to deal with the holy monstrosity that is the warrior/guardian frontlines farting out boons left and right alongside a ton of CC and damage for how durable they are.
---
DPS tempest with dagger/warhorn was a thing in PvE, and the PvP assholes cried enough about dagger ele to see several changes gut the dagger/warhorn dps builds and turn tempest into a gimmick support spec with the only support additions being worthless pvp garbage like superspeed, swiftness, and some extra prot uptime and regen that nobody asked for, while support tempest remains worthless garbage in PvE.
---
I've been using this addon since a few releases earlier and I'm still amazed by the performance improvements! I've been happily using the library for some time, so thank you for your work!!
---
I do have a question. When I've got nothing else running on my computer, I'm hitting around 90/95% on (v)RAM usage and something similar on processing. When I've got some browser tabs open, at some maps, I see 100% usage being achieved and the game stutters every now and then. I've read on the github site this is expected behaviour but I'm wondering if there are things I could do about it, except for closing the browser.
---
Thank you again for this!
---
&gt;Just learn to speak English like most nordic people that play gw2.
---
I'm Russian. I know English and I work in English environment. My English is better than that of my average Nordic client/partner. I love the language and try to improve it every day. Because of that I quit all Russian forums and moved to Reddit. Because of that, I chose GW2 - it has no Russian servers, so I mostly use English there.
---
However, communicating with other Russian players in English just feels stupid (I'm sure little to no Nordic players do it), and transliteration makes me want to vomit. 
---
Nordic players at least have most (if not all) of their alphabet. Adding 66 font symbols at most can't possibly be a huge effort.
---
That is hard to say tomorrow is again balance patch...
---
Thank you I am glad to hear that!
---
Thank you. This is very valuable source of information for me. I will definitely do my best to improve it.
---
Off-topic, something I learned the other day. Keg brawl instance has no boundaries. And it's very easy to hop over the fence. And the devs forgot to do something with instanced Hoelbrak. Use this knowledge responsibly.
---
Aurene is able to withstand the burden of conflicting magics because she has a bond to mortals and can "share the burden" as presented/foreshadowed in the S4E5 instance Champion &amp; Scion.
---
That said, even with Aurene we'll still need 4-6 Elder Dragons living since we need to balance not just magic but The All itself. The All's imbalance will cause Tyria's destruction before overflow od magic will.
---
Also, the Bloodstone held a very minor role in magical balance as it only contained magic from the world after the ED drained most of it. Its purpose was more to keep the ED from getting all Magic, rather than balance magic. Though only one of five Bloodstones exploded.
---
Even underline for links is somewhat archaic
---
The Bloodstone was originally made by the Seers to house magic that the ED hadn't yet consumed during the previous rise. The "gift of magic" was (retconned into being) humans misunderstanding the act of gods releasing the Bloodstone's magic (then putting a bunch back in, as well as draining Zhaitan of some magic while doing so before breaking it into five pieces).
---
Not enough glow to be peak. But its close
---
He means the change that occurred years ago was rather fast. I think it began with HoT, really.
---
Yep those definitely reduced the gap for me. Been there, done that, what's left ist once more some collections.
---
Please note I am not saying all these collections are hard. I just find them annoying, and not achieving the goals a game and an MMO should be striving for: Fun gameplay and cooperative gameplay.
---
I've ecto gambled for a while now and I've broke even pretty much but that's after gambling consistently once per day every day for a little over 2 years ish? and if I win more then 3x-4x of investment always go for the back to back it's digital money as long as you are not converting gems to gold to gamble I don't see a problem with losing it was you're choice to gamble in the first place
---
yup that's how tournaments look for me, 4 come to farm spawn wile 1 caps all the points, and yes I am on the 0 point side. And tbh the maps with only one exit poit are the worst for tournaments
---
There is not enough Russian players for that
---
Doesn't stop ANet from changing pronunciation of a word from an old language.
---
As the Commander, slayer of three dragons and the Champion of Aurene, you get all the shiny new toys. Meanwhile, Kournans are eating dirt soup with a garnish of bone-dwelling scarab. 
---
What you're missing, good sir, is "capitalism", eat the rich, thank you and good night
---
Based on the current comments, I think you have one big misunderstanding about available roles.
---
It seems to me, that you think the roles are Heal, Tank, DPS.
---
But it is quite different actually. 
---
There are Healers, Supporter/Buffer, Tanks, Condi DPS, Power DPS.
---
Every spec can fill at least one of these roles perfectly; and can sometimes help out a bit in others. (Sometimes taking no Full-Healer is ok, because you have enough other specs that can fill it together.)
---
What you are asking, is that your spec suddenly fills a role it is not intended for.
---
CondiDPS and PowerDPS are NOT the same role in this game.
---
I personally think full marauder is the way to go.
---
The difference the average player will see in DPS is negligible compared to the survivability, especially on something like ele.
---
Well if we're simply talking mathematics here, it could be hundreds, thousands, millions of matches? Point is, from individual match perspective, you're definitely going to feel like it's shit and lop sided one way or the other. It's normal because it's small number rule. It doesn't change the fact that the matchmaking *probably* still tries its best to balance out the *net* distribution of win rate. Every match is like a coin flip where the game tries to weight head and tail equally (players' rating). 
---
If pvp has more population, it will probably more or less look the same, just not stupidly wide score difference. 
---
Of course these are all theoretical. Based on my assumption on how I think the match making principal probably works.
---
The way Shades work now should never have been that way in the first place.
---
can't relate and i farm berries with 14 characters   
---
just dodge lmao
---
I was using a Korean keyboard layout earlier on my laptop and was quite surprised to see that it displayed in chat, so I'm surprised to hear that Russian isn't supported. Hopefully Cyrillic characters do get added at some point, since I'm sure it would be used by a fairly large number of players
---
Tried that and the one to reduce mantra charge CD.
---
In the end I went higher boon duration because I don't always have someone doing alacrity in the group.
---
With alacrity you can get by with quite a bit less.
---
Mad King's labyrinth is coming soon. That's the only place for a Power Mirage. There they can shine.
---
I admire the effort you put into this and at this point I would appreciate any changes to the game mode, especially new maps, but IMO what u'r proposing here has a tad too much PvE to come to liking of general public. Also I doubt the 2 devs that take care of WvW have enough time to pull off anything close to this. Also ANet doesn't care about the game mode anyway.
---
That's a different story. But how to tell if a guild is pseudo raiding or not? I mean... I had 2 test raids with them before I've joined in older content. That's pretty much all you can do since there is no real proof that they are actively raiding.
---
I actually also didn't care about they there were not raid ready. It was more the fact that I had to level something new all of the sudden because for reasons...
---
 "Hold on there, you've just ignored most of my reply." Because it's irreverent.  
---
"Axe is a condi weapon. That is undeniable. There is also a version with scepter, but it's undeniable that axe is designed as a condi dps weapon. "  
---
\- a single weapon that only replaces one of the other 2 condi innate weps that you are going to be taking.  
---
 "Minor traits aren't super condi, but the introduction of ambush skills clearly lean towards condi dps. The only weapons that were given meaningful dps ambush skills were axe and scepter, two condi weapons."   
---
\-This is a context of the problem I want remedied.  
---
 "Self deception and infinite horizon may not be condi traits if you just read the description, but traits are all about synergies. They're not good because of some unexpected synergy, they are built with that synergy in mind. "  
---
\- Infinite horizon being attached to ambush is the point above that i Want to be remedied, and self deception can work in any build because it generates illusions and this is an illusion generator. Chrono has Illusionary reversion which was supposedly strong enough to get nerfed a bunch while people were playing power specs, and dueling has deceptive evasion.  
---
"For utilities, crystal sands and jaunt are both condition-damage skills, with additional effects leaning towards condi damage from traits."  
---
\-Crystal sands and Jaunt also have coefficents, one that was actually nerfed in terms of POWER in pvp because it secured kills.  
---
"Why is this different from asking about healing?"  
---
Because buffing damage coefficients on attacks that do damage is different from asking for a skill to be reworked to contain healing when there is no reasonable reason for it to. No one looks at confusing images as a damaging beam out of your wand to heal you and near by allies.
---
Holo, spellbreaker, weaver, mirage in this particular order on the op scala.
---
As for most annoying builds to fight it's condi thief and mirage.
---
That's debatable especially since weaver is so hard to max out anyway due to all the swapping and CD's to keep track of.
---
If your running the Condi variant of it however a bit of carrion is much less noticible of a loss then marauder is on the power one and can actually be worked in easily as the spec is very easy to cap burns &amp; bleeds out on.
---
They should pronounce it Im-PURR-ra-tor. That's the Charr's way.
---
It wouldn't. Even if GW2 had your standard horses (which is pretty stupid to not have in a medieval/Renaissance world anyway) - those would have been better than not having them. 
---
There is zero fucking reason why having to spec for out-of-combat perma-swiftness for faster travel could be considered a good design decision.
---
i think what you've made is already really good!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
if i had to be nit picky though:
---
Making the name of the achievement and its description bold (personal opinion of course), same with the bullet points listing the names of the achievements in the guide!
---
maybe a little more space between each achievement (just another enter press should do it)
---
otherwise really good job and im looking forward to follow your progress and see where it ends up
---
English is anarchy (an-ARE-key) and America (AH-mer-IK-ah) should never have been given tea to throw into the harbour (HAR-bore)
---
It's gonna be called UwU Online.
---
This is like asking to have Power DPS druid at the same level of Power soulbeast. In other words sorry but it's nosense.
---
It got nerfed recently and receives further nerfs tomorrow. I think it's within reason.
---
Tot sad the icon for taco Comes @ the same place as the PVP one. When i change language to English the most part of taco stays French.
---
Otherwise great help.
---
Nah that’s just that one guy stacking infusions.
---
Power dps ren ain't actually that bad, its about 31-33k dps depending on target size.
---
the content is good yet not as good as can be, keep up with the good work. 
---
The site design needs a lot of work thou. For example you need parallax effect  image so when you scroll down you don't see the image moving. You need an exceprt in the front page, That wordpress does it automatically.   
---
Also you have very good free themes for WP (don't confuse it with woodenpotatoes) you can use to get rid most of the design. 
---
I see you didn't miss the affiliated link in the top of the page neither the donation buttons. I would focus first in the design and content before show so much monetization.
---
Using the paragraph about the media content being from their respective owners does not free you to use it without their explicit consent. You are still vulnerable to a lawsuit from the media owners as you are monetizing the site (as such is not considered a fan site but a commercial one) .
---
Might be a star? Not sure.
---
Is GW2 the go-to furry MMO now?
---
yikes
---
The Star to guide us...
---
Exactly. Each of those statements are true, thus entire statement is true.
---
Aetherblades were also using/are technically still using holograms for battle.
---
I thought those only reside in the Mistlock Sanctuary. Did one of them break out into the wilderness?
---
I think the biggest problem your suggestion would bring is events around the keep getting upscaled due to players using those amenities.
---
I was in by myself and had an npc playing against me until someone joined, then it was 2 against 1 lol.
---
Absolutely unplayable.
---
I'm assuming this is sarcasm.
---
Agree. When developers introduced elite specs, they said:
---
- Mesmer is utility and DPS
---
- Chrono is support and CC
---
- Mirage is DPS: Both power and condi
---
This is how they are supposed to work. It is the law. Purity of purpose. Yet players manage to turn chrono into power DPS. What? That's illegal.
---
Developers also said GW2 is versatile: If GW2 is supposed to be truly versatile, every single spec should be power, condi, support, healer and tank.
---
Not everyone enjoys meta either. It is probably effective, but particularly not fun. Players play whatever they find fun.
---
Raids need somewhat meta-ish builds, at least a build what manages to do average DPS. But it is not possible. Meta-players in raids are so scared of non-meta builds so much they kick instantly instead of giving a try. It kills versatility, fun and what GW2 is supposed to be: Play whatever you enjoy.
---
I'm not surprised Dulfy took off. It seemed like everyone did nothing but criticize her and now they act all offended that she left.
---
Best of luck to you, and ignore anyone who tries to do the same to you.
---
&gt;with like 12 of those being identical to the Latin ones
---
This right here is why it's not trivial to add Cyryllic. Think about why.
---
Bad fake, next to no screeching, existential dread. Who are you and what did you do to Monstrum?
---
:')
---
I'm very curious to see how Snargle will deal with the events at the end of the Prologue...
---
Though honestly I'm all for some silly comics right now :)
---
Perhaps this is exactly how Mistlock Sanctuary looks from outside world.
---
You definitely have more chance on rare loot, there's no question around it. 
---
The difference isn't much, but it's there.
---
Please!
---
Very well produced video! Upvoted
---
Nah, it starts flaring up if you'd wait around for dawn.
---
Boonbeast is alive and well though
---
Through respect, dedications, and chemical reactions in my brain
---
Living World season 6 will be us dealing with the environmental damage caused by players with enough stacked infusions to warm Tyria.
---
Dunno, "blood keep" is a bit of a weird name to begin with. Is it the only keep they have? The main one? Why is it just a border fort then? 
---
That's like humans building a random border stronghold and calling it Fort Kryta while installing a penthouse for Jennah.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I don't think the keep is the citadel myself, but I can certainly understand the confusion.
---
same here also
---
Anet should totally revamp guilds system.
---
Or a space station?
---
horizontal =/= ascended
---
Ever been to the Black Citadel?
---
since every condi boss is very weak to torment or confusion, mirage is pretty much BiS in almost every condi boss, except for dhuum since he attacks super slowly and the stacking of renegades means you have no issue boon stripping after each phase, same can be said for QtP since he needs boonstripping aswell, and axe 3 can kill you  if you are unlucky, other bosses like Sabeth(low attack speed, doesn't move for 3/4 of the fight, sappers resetting firebrand f1 make it super strong in that fight).
---
Power Mirage was never meant to be the BiS stat choice, just look at the mirage traits and skills, only 1 weapon has a dodge attack that might have good power sinergy, greatsword, and even so its main reason is to stack might and do some aoe damage, no so much a dps efficient skill/trait like chrono has chronophantasma.
---
Is this just a random rant post or are you actually talking about something you dont even understand? chrono might have been nerfed countless times but has also been buffed quite a bit, most of the nerfs are to make up for anets mistakes of making this spec so overloaded. now that they finally brought down boon chrono to an  "acceptable level", we still have power chrono stacking on a lot of bosses since timewarp can give permanent quickness if you got enough mesmers, and since you only need 1 renegade to give alacrity to 10 people permanent boon uptimes are probably more braindead than in chaos chrono times, where at least you had to press more than 1 button.
---
TL:DR: mirage is definitely not a niche build, anet was never able to balance mesmer in general.
---
It's not a gray area. You can't protect designs or ideas because someone, who has never seen your work, could also have the same idea. Otherwise every first person shooter released in the past 20 years would have run into this issue. Or let's say, you were not allowed to release a game with the same setting as a game from another developer. Destiny and Anthem for example, would fall under this category. Tomb Raider and Uncharted as well. 
---
BUT that's different with artwork like skill icons. Here you have a pretty clear case because that can't just happen by accident. Especially if they also use the same color codes as the original.
---
This is basically the exact same route I use.
---
It's played as brawler because half of its stats are used on healing power and vitality and most of its traits are focused on defense. 
---
Why is power reaper the first thing people recommend in pve and sword weaver something that people should avoid?
---
Abstract dps has nothing to do with raid performance though. Weaver has the best dps on golem for a while now, yet the latest ERP has seen less than 5 weavers in total. Even when bosses are just dps golems, you still didn't see almost any weaver there. They are almost nonexistent even in speedclears.
---
I can agree with that and understand why, but that does bring my spirits down... I know that GW2 is gonna be alive for a long time, yet
---
I just really feel like I’m still missing a big chunk of the story even after doing all of Season 2 and reading up by a lot on the wiki. I wish I was there to experience it... I was around, but my first (and main character) wasn’t even level 80 until the end of the Battle for Lion’s Arch, so I missed almost all of it. In hindsight, really wishing I’d put more playtime into GW2 at the time. That was the height of my addiction to TF2 (and in the tail end of TF2’s Glory Days), so I wasn’t playing GW2 as much. Well, I suppose Hindsight is 20/20.
---
for the moa wings its 5s per chili atm and for the firebreather chili its a bit more complicated, since you need the chilis for the blend of charr spices and charred meat. Those are also tradeable but its cheaper to buy them atm than crafting yourself.
---
&gt; Why would anyone use or craft that???
---
The Moa Wings and Firebreather Chili give your character special effects. The Moa Wings let your character burp black smoke and the firbreather chili lets you breath fire every 30-40 secs.
---
The moa wing effect is nothing special but the firebreathing is quite nice.
---
I don't know who's getting disciplined here, but it's definitely not me
---
You are literally linking to a comment that specifies Swedish.
---
The last jump I tend to do on DH F2. I don't even know the proper way
---
Well, tournaments aren't ballanced at all. You can see the difference between a random group of silver players that just want the participation rewards and an organized group of high elo players, that queue whenever they have time to get the 1st place price.
---
Of course you get stomped. Would be terrible if it wasn't so onesided.
---
divinity is strong with this one
---
In that comment I was quoting you, that was the only Swedish part. I was talking about American Extended ASCII in general.
---
Does WvW participation decay in there?
---
I plan on going back to those eventually!
---
Once in a blue moon you'll find someone multiboxing, grabbing a keg off each other in the corner on repeat. Otherwise, it's daily day or dead.
---
What's an efficient way to grind masteries in HoT? I don't like grinding jut for the sake of exp ... much rather explore the map and do some of the PoI/Hero points/Vistas. Unfortunately I've been stuck on a few in a row last night, where I'm missing the mastery to do so, it's annoying. Leveling is ... slow.
---
Mastery points I'm managing, through story and various challenges on the map, I have what I need.
---
https://youtu.be/DxmkAoLC6_4

Good tacos require fresh corn tortillas. Maybe pick some up and try putting them in your CD drive. 
---
If that doesn’t work, try installing Adobe Reader.
---
Then you should have specified, instead of leaving the context of the comment you were replying to.  This is your mistake.
---
Thats the Divinity’s eclipse. 
---
Get with the program.
---
Do meta events basically. Check when the different metas are up for each map and try to find a squad in LFG.
---
I thought it wasn't necessary. Oh well, just a case of miscommunication 🤷‍♂
---
Thank you! I guess I didn't realized how many recipes needed to be bought and consumed.
---
I was just trying to make the regular oiled coat, not the warbeast, though those components are also available to me. Do you know offhand if the regular oiled is also a "bought" recipe? That would explain that, if so.
---
Yes, but if you play a lot of WvW, you can also get the pips / reward track while in there. Thus you get extra rewards for beeing in there and then, next time you WvW, you get your pip / reward track progress to max again.
---
(This makes it even better, not worse. ;)  )
---
I'll settle for ANET restoring the heal we used to get off Greatsword, which was changed to only activating when executing a finisher in a light field (Greatsword being Guardians' easiest mechanism to do so) until they removed it completely....because...reasons.
---
I knew what this was before I clicked and I still watched it. ITS ALL TRUE
---
this thing was so easy only took me like 5 tries to get gold and gtfo from there forever
---
That literally doesn't tell people anything.
---
Mirage was made to be a condi spec. If we follow your logic every class should be  powerDPS,condiDPS,offensive support,healer, nd tank on a meta level. So no mirage should not be able to power dps
---
That conversation more than anything made me feel really unwelcome. And it plays every time someone walks by. I now avoid walking there just so the poor merchant gets left alone.

---
Don't forget that Scarlet was a Holosmith as well and as far as we know, she never stepped foot into Elona.
---
And even if this technology originates from there. It is actually only natural that they use the burning sunlight of the desert for their inventions. I mean, we also build massive solar panels in the desert and not somewhere in the UK because... weather.
---
Yeah, I misunderstood the other comment when you said you swapped maps. I assumed it meant like Grothmar to Lion's Arch and back, haha. Was so frustrating! Now I'm paranoid every time. :(
---
Thats because they were working with Scarlet, the first Holosmith we met in the story.
---
First time but my opinion about the gods didn’t change/ after we killed all dragons -&gt; gw3 should be about hunting all the useless gods just for fun
---
Thief, stealth in all possible form, is your friend for harvesting that map.
---
I like the idea OP put up in that having different keeps offer different buffs for fighting etc.  I think it would encourage more defending and fighting in general.  However, they did implement that whole "more objectives" into WvW, that's red bbl and lets face it, that map is a nightmare to play on.  It had potential with the various shrines but the implementation didn't play out.
---
&gt;Have you played Heart of Thorns? That's why. Airships are easy to pop.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The Charr have Charr copters, which shined after the airships failed.
---
Don't blame them. It worked the first time. Nobody could imaging that the nature elder dragon can mobilize the whole fucking forest. /s
---
No but for real... Charr copters also go down like flies. I can't count how often I was killed in Dragon Fall by one of these things.
---
Weird, it’s one of the few that I don’t like. Somehow the whole brazier thing out on the ice just feels contrived and silly to me.
---
I love this idea!! Though I worry that Alliances will not be the "fix" we're all hoping for.
---
While there's no chance at us becoming the ruler of a nation, I would like to see the idea of our character (if they're the Charr PC) being potential Khan-Ur material talked about. Like it doesn't have to be in an overly upfront way, but something like passing mentions about the concerns (as well as praises) random Charr NPCs have could be nice. Somethings like; fear of our over collaboration and friendship with other races, fear of us having too much power with the introduction of an army on top of an Elder Dragon, fear that the citizens would just be used as potential minions of Aurene, maybe rumors that we're a Shining Blade loyalist, fear that we won't be able to be an effective leader with our duties as an Elder Dragon slayer/protector of Tyria, and so on.
---
This is the issue with bespoke art direction to make each area feel unique. Usually tied with the sentence: "no one will notice"
---
Someone always does.
---
Also with this game you have to accept it's a fantasy setting with medieval themes but with modern day American accents.
---
*Laughs in chrono*

Here have some aegis buddy

If I invite friends or guild mate to harvest the ascended plant I planted. Can they harvest it to? And just ask them to send me the harvested material? Or anet made it only the owner literally can only harvest it
---
Thank you. Dulfy always did good job and her guides helped thousands of people.
---
Do Tyrians really call their star 'sun'?
---
Agreed.  It would have made sense to implement them at the same time.  Still if they at least try this, it might make some of the pain go away a bit.
---
:D you can check my gender when I am streaming. But i am not gonna use makeup, cleavage so I look like snow troll.
---
I swapped to marauder's gear (Power/precision/ferocity/vitality) and it's helped so much with staying alive, like night and day. Literally was asking this same question to my guild a few weeks ago: I love weaver, but I feel like I get sneezed on, what do?
---
Simple enough, with marauders you can still use the meta fire air, take the vit talent in weaver and have 20k hp, throw in arcane shield, the spin-evades and you can evade and break out of CC like no tomorrow while still dishing out crazy dps.
---
Thank you for noticing. I check it.
---
All mysteries can be explained with 6 simple worlds: Secret Inquest Base on the Moon.

I mean, the name is "countdown", it would better have been a "XXxx"... or something more catchy.

They are account-wide, and can only be harvested multiple times with a Glyph of Bounty.

"S-shut it down, bookah."

T7 cooking mats are NOT bound
---
I completely and utterly disagree because the grind would be so incredibly painful.
---
I just want my own supply and asking question so I can get effecient way of getting more. Ty
---
Mine did this after updating. I uninstalled the mod and deleted the folder and it was still doing it. I did a repair on GW2 by adding "- repair" to the end of the target line in the shortcut properties and then running it. After which I reinstalled the mod and it all worked fine.
---
It no longer changes based on time of day. They take an average of WvW activity over the day or week to decide the population. There is a periodic recalculation but it isn't announced. Some servers have been listed as Full for months.
---
If your guild's server has a link then you can try transferring there but you'll very likely need to transfer again when the links are redone every 2 months.
---
Changes don't happen on even a daily basis. In order for your target server to not be "full", it would need to have a reduced WvW population for several weeks.
---
mate, yer too late, it's already been done
---
Bro mirage is meta at 4 encounters and an extremely strong build overall. Your class (Mesmer) has a meta build for every single encounter in the game, what more do you want? You even have power Chrono so you aren't even lacking power dps. Mirages job is CONDI dps and it does it pretty fucking good.
---
what do u get from the chests? same like other adventures?
---
After that, get a New mastery: Fractal Echoes. 
---
Unlock extra 'current character' slots, allowing you to play with more tan one character at a time, Granado Espada style.
---
 Then you'll have 3 characters at the same time who can do all roles at the same time.
---
I agree, honestly that is the best part about GW2. I used to say living story was the best part, but ever since updates slowed down, now I'd say it's the horizontal progression.
---
I just really wish there was an MMO that had:
---
- Guild Wars 2 Style Progression and monetization/business model
---
- Archeage style sandbox elements(1 giant map, ocean, trade runs, land ownership, etc) and crafting
---
- Tera style combat(pure action, dodge/block everything.
---
Such a chrono thing to do.
---
Ascended rings were added in November 2012, less than three months after the game released. They said when it was released that a) it was always planned to be the true max tier for gear, and b) the tier would eventually cover all types of gear. The last type of equipment (other than air breathers) to be released was armor, about a year later, December 2013. 
---
What I'm saying here is two-fold: a) this was not "adding power creep", this was implementing the plan that was always there for gear, and b) in order for your story to be completely true, you had to have gotten all classes in exotic gear within three months of the game's release and then been surprised and offended that they thought that that was too fast for their long-lasting MMO to have as their top tier gear, enough to quit the game.
---
If you ever change your mind and get curious about getting into raids, there are Discord servers for both the NA and the EU servers with the intention of training raids. They will be far more relaxed and helpful than random pugs. On the NA side the LFG is mostly used by people outside of statics or raid servers these days.
---
Of course, no need to get into raids. They're a small part of the game. But they aren't always as toxic as the LFG might suggest.
---
I always wondered why those can't be integrated into official wiki. There would be many people to help with that, and all the groundwork is already done as well...
---
That's one way to get rid of the elder dragons.
---
Agreed. I've found it very difficult to find anyone willing to take someone in for a training run. Honestly it's probably killing GW2 for new and returning players since they're focusing on raids which are inaccessible to new players.
---
See PvE players have stuff to look forward to Living world, festivals, current events, bonus weeks (yes I know not everyone likes these but still some people like them). PvP players have seasons, swiss tournaments coming, Automated Tournaments and balance updates. WvW players have nothing to look forward to maybe balance patches and some new reward tracks. Season in WvW that last 4 weeks would work brilliantly it would get people like me into the game type, have more people working towards reward tracks and pips maybe bring back WvW tournament meta achievements.
---
&gt;There was never a single mention of higher tier gear being intended to be in the game, if they stated that multiple years down the road it's as good as false.
---
As I said in my other post: your memory is wrong.
---
[Here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_equipment#Trivia) is the wiki link listing when each tier of ascended gear was released. It started in Nov 2012 and ended in Dec 2013, excluding the air breathers. These things were added months after the game's release, not years. There is a link to the mid-2013 dev update post talking about how the ongoing roll-out of ascended rewards was going. None of this was a surprise. You can go back to their original press release for ascended and see the quote where they say it was planned from the start, that was only 3 months after the game released. 
---
Stop fighting this, you're just wildly wrong here.
---
Nah, Ele doesn't need more HP. Nothing more needed to say.
---
That is not prejudice we talk about a fact  
---
&gt; Simply buffing clones so they scale with power while slotting mirage  would make it viable and there isn't any reason not to do it other than  intentionally limiting it from being playable. 
---
That sounds like the most fuked up, overly difficult solution anyonre came up with till now. You want to change core stuff based on a spec.......  
---
Also this would Buff condi mirage as well which is bad cause condi mirage is allready broken by design.
---
also it would have to be a huge Buff to come even close to power chrono which brings the same utility and way more dps atm.  
---
You want to Buff the clones on mirage to make up for the missing dmg....  
---
The Mirage spec brings ambush to the power version while chrono brings Chronophantasma/Danger Time/Time Catches up and Continum Split.  
---
You need to increase the dmh of mirage clones by like 200% to make up for that  
---
This sounds stupidly broken if we consider that condi mirage is a thing and i don't want to know how dominant that would be in PvP
---
I see. Thanks!
---
Thanks so much for making this guide! It is massively helpful. 
---
If you want to keep it up-to-date, we can now feed the baby skyscale four times a day.
---
I never started the Skyscale because people were saying how much of a grind it is, but I'm enjoying it so far!
---
Nah, cause you've somehow completely missed my point. You do you.
---
I know that it sounds egoistic but I always wanted my own project. I have ytb, twitch, fb and I wanted to have my website too. Later this website should be not only for gw.
---
I mean Lion's Arch desperately needs a redo so bring it.
---
I mean, Final Fantasy 14 pulled it off.
---
Boosting off of a jump with a Beetle -&gt; Bond of Faith -&gt; Griffon or Skyscale is a pretty sweet trick. 
---
Skimmer over water next to a cliff-&gt; fast double tap switch to skyscale to climb it is very useful in some places where you're definitely "supposed" to go around.
---
And that's the thing: all of the really cool tricks just get you there a little faster or in a slightly different route than the way you're "supposed" to go. It just feels really good to be able to, say, aim your skyscale so perfectly that you can confidently boost to the top of a cliff instead of saving your juice in case you need to recharge his flight bar.
---
Yeaaaaah I kind of always felt the gods were worthless in GW1, hell even when we talk to Lyssa directly in Nightfall she basically tells us to go play mom and clean up their mess.
---
Get your non-meta logic out of here.
---
I’ve played the game off and on since beta, and played all the professions. Weaver is one of the most difficult to play, I would say, and can be punishing - especially if you’re new to the game. 
---
I want to recommend another profession until you feel more comfortable with the game, but that all depends on what kind of gamer you are. It’s also a very rewarding one to play, because when you get it, the feeling of mastery over the mechanics is really satisfying.
---
Not from the menu, and i already do this but need to show some icon from far.
---
You can use the preset config file:
---
For installer, if TacOConfig.xml file is already present, installer dont replace them but with the ZIP version there is a config file with a preset of unselected markers, to mask them. You can use this. By default TacO dont mask marker i know.
---
So if you use preset file all are hidden, and you activate only what you want.Or you can disabled marker in menu, and after that, TacO keep this settings, after you activate only the mark you want.
---
BoyC the dev of TacO has already put this thing in TODO list for future improvements.
---
Should do normal mode first.
---
And then they slap you down and tell you to get back in line.
---
oh ok, interesting. Thanks. Gotta work on my dodging ;)
---
**For all comment of TacO fonction or features**  
---
go to the subreddit here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/GW2TacO/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GW2TacO/)
---
And for all comment or others for the ReActif Pack, indicate in title the pack name because there are 3 main versions:  
---
\- TacO with no pack  
---
\- ReActif Packages  
---
\- Tekkit's external pack  
---
Thanks

In lore, there is no such thing as a solar system, the Mists "begin" at the edge of Tyria's atmosphere, and it and the objects around it in "space" are less regular than they would be in a properly gravitationally bound system. The Mists aren't just a different dimension; they're also what exists instead of outer space, and the vague nature of the Mists means the devs can do basically whatever to the celestial bodies in the sky and it's still technically lore-friendly.
---
Thank you for the effort! Dulfy's absence left such a void, I'm glad someone is stepping up to help the community &lt;3
---
The muscle memory you have should carry over to a naga well from the g600. Minus the 3rd mouse click up top.
---
Playability &gt; realism. And it's pretty easy to tell when it's day or night, there's still a big difference.
---
There's no night time, the sun just gets a little bit darker. 
---
Very few maps in the game actually have anything approaching a dark night. But it looks really good on the ones that do.
---
This is the content I pay for 🤡
---
Well. All I can say is ty for your fuckup. I didn't know about this, will download later.
---
I agree with this.  Ele should be aligned with thief when it comes to base HP.  Both of them are glass cannons with some evades.  Though staff ele is somewhat stuck once they start their rotation if they want to get the full rotation of meteor off.
---
Also with the addition of weaver which was supposed to add Sword, having a base hp boost would have made sense since it's supposed to go into melee range.  If specing into weaver gave the option of having that base hp boost added as a "silent" or deliberate trait then giving the class a melee weapon would make sense.  Having the base HP stay low but giving Weaver a melee weapon, in my opinion was counter-productive.
---
They are referring to before mounts entirely, when some classes had to basically run an entire build to keep up with other classes that just needed a signet and maybe a warhorn.
---
I've heard Bloodstone dust is pretty invigorating.
---
But I am not answering OP. The comment I'm answering is far broader than "stuff suitable for beginners".
---
Twilight + desert rose backpack XD nice combo though.
---
If, um...if you toss 4 legendaries into the mystic forge, you're guaranteed to get something of legendary rarity back, right? Like an obsidian shard or mystic clover (1/3 of the time)
---
Gotta agree with that, at least for open world.
---
Agreed.  I think when Weaver was created with a sword spec, there should have been an HP boost added as the passive for choosing to spec into it.  A melee weapon means close range which means you should have a higher hp added to the equation. (I think that slotting weapons should actually change the hp personally but I understand if that's harder to implement).
---
If you're given the option of melee weapons raise the base hp, if you're getting ranged weapons then it's time to lower the base hp.  (Unless those ranged weapons only offer utility under those circumstances a case could be made for leaving them the same).
---
....or you could eat \*nothing\* and get the same gold in most content, your food isn't going to be the determining factor in whether you're successful or even significantly improve your kill time.
---
You know what, this is solid advice/feedback. Cheers.
---
I should have added that on my mbp (2016) those are the numbers I saw but even then, we can have variance in hardware (RAM and CPU) for that laptop.
---
xD Yep.
---
Well, you're in the wrong thread then, because Mindshattered and Marvelous\_Choice were specifically talking about "new" and "average" players, here. So you might as well have said "Might be true, but you can't use it in sPvP" for all the relevance it had to the thread.
---
One change to a skill doesn't kill the class. I'll continue to play my necromancer/scourge, and continue to do just fine. RIP people who scream at every single skill change.
---
Personally? I think the problem might be staff.  I think the weapon needs an overhaul.  I was using it on my tempest till the nerfs (it was at the time the best weapon for zerging and for sieging).  You still use it when trying to take down siege at the enemy tower/keep but there's only 1 viable use (meteor) which is less than it used to be.
---
There are other weapons and other builds that are far more viable these days.  I think water on staff is a bit underpowered compared to other support tier classes.  Though I agree I switch to water if I or someone near me is about to die too.
---
I think Guards have the best in game healing/support abilities currently thanks to Firebrand.  I would agree if you were talking base guard but Firebrand is best in class.
---
I do miss the previous scepter though... While I like the cc, I am not a fan of the sound effect.
---
True.  Though I still think it's best in class when you spec into Firebrand.  Though I am worried about the upcoming changes to tome 3.  I am not a fan of the aegis removal.
---
The moon is just the back of the sun
---
Looks like profile icons from Overwatch, they look nice.
---
Tempest with a decent team is a great support class and pretty good on 5 man groups. But not since mid-HoT days would I have ever considered Tempest a truly viable class for DPS. What it sounds like here was this tempest was running a bunker to distract you while the rest of their team picked you off with higher damage skills.
---
raids, fractals, wvw, pvp, fashion wars, achievement hunting, running metas for drop chances, working on alts.
---
In PvE, the general state of the game is DPS over all else. This means most builds aim at glass cannon, some are less glassy due to base stats. Weaver is this above pretty much all else. More than that though, it has to be, because it offers little else. For example, bringing a weaver to a fractal group means you have one party member bringing relatively little CC, which puts a heavier onus on the rest of the party to break bars. Usually the above is fine since its not a big ask and the weaver should put out high DPS. However, if you run low DPS, more tanky, you now dont bring DPS and you have the low CC, nor do you bring any particularly useful utility such as quickness/alac/banners. This actually highlights a problem with weaver, it isnt the easiest class to do well with DPS-wise, it is the easiest class to go down a lot, and it brings little utility; this results in a number of groups not really preferring weaver--granted, CM community isnt huge, if you get recognized as a good weaver, the DPS potential alone is enough to warrant a DPS spot.
---
(Note, this is with regards to fractal CM. In regular T4 groups, you can pretty much do whatever you want. In those groups, plenty still run druids/chronos, condi/heal scourges, etc. So if you want to bring a non-meta class, you can do far, far worse than non-100% DPS weaver.)
---
Move your donate button to the top of the page, nobody will see it burried down there :)
---
I don't get this "Not allowed to play part".
---
I cannot remember the last time I have seen someone kicked for the only reason of playing a non-meta class/build. Can't even remember when I last saw a player getting kicked for trashtier dps, and I have seen ppl on meta classes dps race chronos. As long as the boss dies it's usually all just fine for the ppl, sure you might get a nastu jab or few thrown at you if you did less damage on cairn than the boon chrono did, but kicked? Can't say that's too realistic. And I raid on a daily basis, joining whatever is on the LFG.
---
I have also seen power mirages here and there, and yes, their dps isn't too amazing, but it really ain't too bad either atleast not bad enough to warranty a kick by any means. On some bosses with fairly short phases it might even be kinda okay.
---
Really the only ppl I see constantly being kicked are the fellows who join with a core class, sub 2k AP to a relatively high req squads without saying or pinging anything.
---
You don't get ad revenue for sending info to Dulfy either, so she could edit it and put it up on her site, yet people did it.
---
Oh wow, they're really not aiming for my demographic.
---
5 attempts with less than 30 seconds of survival in any attempt and no detectable improvement across those attempts....and I peaced out, never to revisit it ever again.
---
What is it exactly you are using?
---
now if only the food was worth using
---
I agree I will continue to play my necromancer/scourge, and the change doesn't kill the class, but I appreciate the others voicing their concern for my favorite class. Most of my time is spent in pve with my guild and doing fractals, when I do wvw I understood the complaints as we were maybe a little too good. I am mostly a support scourge using the trait for one bigger shade and taking me out of the equation feels like I am only going to be half as effective as my effective shades goes from 2 to 1. I don't need to hit more targets, I hit everything I needed to with what I had. I would greatly like to have my area coverage back.
---
The trick is finding your favorite one! Nice job!
---
Oh thanks for that, when I have time, I will check them out and map them with proper locations in case they might be relevant in the future!

---
That's a whole lot of ideas ANet will ignore and keep doing the nothing they are now.
---
Then you're totally set.  Having a small group that is active and inviting you is the key.  Being solo can be complicated and a bit frustrating.
---
I think it's the hat, looks like a Bobby
---
But why
---
don't forget to eat all your birthday cards and any drawing kids give to you as well ...
---
Merging servers stops Gem sales.
---
Exactly. It's just a whole new level of excitement to have a group of active players to play with. We claimed our Guild Hall last week, we've run fractals and dungeons, etc. It's so much better than going solo or just using LFG for everything.
---
All this is just to say that yeah, finding an inviting guild to join is definitely recommended.
---

Amazing work man. Really looking forward to seeing how this project evolves over time. Is it possible to add the fog removal from GW2hook too? Or can ReShade take care of that? It's the only thing keeping me from switching off of GW2hook.

You can try to lower subsleep and lifetime values in config

It is fine for first/clean install.

You afk in Mistlock Sanctuary and blind others with your 9 stacked infusions. That's hardcore endgame

Nice! Just a little wierd that the skimmers are shown from a different view then the other mounts.

5. infusions??

7. i like killing many people, lets do that (wvw)

8. what, there is more than 1 class i can do stuff on?
---
do you mean you cant eat the food underwater or that the effect doesnt show?
---
Lol.
---
It was three months, it's not like there was a crazy long period of time between release and ascendes dropping. The idea that ascended was hastily scratched together is a conspiracy theory that was ridiculous then and it's ridiculous now. 
---
People left "in droves", nah. People **complained** in droves, because that's what people do.
---
Thank you very much for your feedback I value your opinion.
---
Thank you. This is very useful tip.
---
Easiest way to survive as a weaver is to throw a sandstorm, then your nuke, and if you get downed you'll have the downed lava font to add up even more damage. If this doesn't work you're either against a champ or you're not glassy enough

That's because the frontal view of the skimmer. (so if you would look at its head) isn't that distinctive as with the other mounts. I felt that most of characteristics of the skimmers is shown in it's whole body instead of just the head if that sort of makes sense. :P

There is a little "outpost" on Wayfarer Foothills in which you have Artesany masters and a bank and a TP on the Queendale as well. Might not be on the same place, but doesn't mean TPs/Banks are citadels uniques

Dont think that's how that works at all. Since its tied entirely to WvW participation.

Can't eat the food underwater. Only found out recently for the Halloween food because I've been using them for leveling and sometimes the food runs out while I am in water.

I mostly play solo and it's impossible to do it solo. LFG hasn't had much successful in getting a group either.
---
very nice work so far, looking promising keep up the good work.

In any case, this does not prevent the person in charge from reporting questions or thoughts or ideas for improvement or when something seems strange.
---
already it will please the person to see that there are people who are interested and then it may happen that you find something that the creator did not think of, or had not seen.
---
Recent example, a player creating TacO packs for him and friends for Role Play taught me that one of the TacO functions could be used differently and gave me examples which allowed me to discover other possibilities and avoid having to start from 0 on the use of this function (these were locationaltimer.xml which can be used for more advanced things than currently although it is not yet possible without a modification of the overlay itself)
---
I'm used to infusions, but the first piece of cultural armor in years, even though people had been asking for new cultural stuff for the longest time ? 
---
I honestly think they need to tweak the drop rate on those a little bit. Because supply is so low, that even if I wanted to buy it for thousands of gold off the TP, I couldn't. 
---
Plus, it feels like a giant slap in the face to fashion wars players ( which is different from infusions, because let's face it, most people going for lots of infusions aren't actually interested in good character looks ). Just aside from the fact that it's cultural and thus Charr only, it's also like Anet saying "here's that cultural stuff you've been asking for, except you still can't get it".
---
They really should make it so enemies (and downed players) have significantly higher priority for being drawn than other players.
---
The draw priority should go something like this:  
---
1. The player (and their pet/minions/clones, if applicable)  
---
2. The player's current target.  
---
3. All enemies, with legendary enemies having the highest priority and regular enemies having the lowest. (This also includes mobs that are not aggressive, but will attack back if you strike first.)  
---
4. Downed players (and dead NPCs pertaining to an event, like the supply dolyaks in the Silverwastes).  
---
5. Players (and their pet/minions, but not clones) in your subgroup in a squad.  
---
6. Players (and their pet/minions, but not clones) in your squad.  
---
7. Dead players and non-event related NPCs.  
---
8. Alive Friendly NPCs.  
---
9. Alive players.  
---
10. Friendly Mesmer clones.  
---
11. Ambient creatures.  
---
At least this way in a massive zerg of players, you shouldn't end up getting blindsided by a champ you weren't targeting at the time, and also be able to see the players that need help getting back on their feet.
---
EDIT: Knew I was missing something. Added Mesmer clones to the list.
---
Nope. Doesn't work that way. Even if many people leave the server, it's still locked until the aggregate numbers show a reduction in the number of player-hours in WvW for multiple weeks.

---
You can search the discord history if you want to delve knees-deep into the shit, as well as the block/unblock log in the wiki. You'll find I wasn't the first one to deal with this too. I don't recommend wasting your time like that though, you'll gain nothing and probably lose faith in a lot of people. I already told the admins my side of the story, so they'll do whatever they see fit, if anything. They weren't happy though, that I can tell.
---
I'm honest when I say I don't care anymore, and not just about the wiki, but the game in general. I'm one of those who kind of gave up after the LW5 announcement thing. GW2 is no longer my "top priority", I might get to post a thing or two in the future, more on the design side of things, but I'm never going to spend the same amount of effort again. Don't expect anything like [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Lon-ami/Cantha) or [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Lon-ami/Living_World_Season_1) ever again.
---
I already saw SC2 and D3 crash and burn, while being part of the staff in official fansites for both games, and I don't plan to go through that again. I'll make sure to have a new boat before this one sinks.
---
To some extent, I'm even grateful, if that makes you feel better. You always learn new stuff and technologies with every wiki. I'm proud of my work and I'll probably replicate it wherever I go next.
---
Yeah games taking too long is also an issue, but the fact you have to win 500 times, considering you're as skilled as the other 5 players, it can take 2500 games ... its just madness. I think they should just remove it and replace with smth else or reduce the number to 100 for instance.

Good to know. I favoured using Dulfy over wiki since I just assumed it was kept vague so people don't get spoilered or it doesn't turn into a guide website since I could never get any more info on achievements and such other than copypaste of what is being said in game.
---
I only have Charr, sorry.
---
Even exceedingly important enemies aren’t always shown. I’ve been one shot by Axemaster Hareth in DS lane phase when I hadn’t even realized he’d spawned yet.
---
Theres no way thats not what he was going for, right?
---
Much appreciated!
---
Yes, this is what I am doing exactly.
---
Depends on your class/build :)
---
As written in The Order of the Stick:
---
&gt; Everything I've seen here just confirms my belief that the gods, taken as a group, do not have our best interests as their highest priority.
---
Just flat design. Worked alot with it during my internship and wanted to make some GW2 stuff with it. :P
---
Don't complain about how others want to be efficient and think about a solution yourself: open a squad and put "everyone welcome, bring your own builds" in the lfg and then see how far you come.
---
I want to grind stuff and get the best equipment possible over a long time, but I'm still a casual player... are people really looking into dmg that intensively?
---
Sneak preview
---
Good Cub.
---
The collections aren't too bad if you're raiding regularly, but it will take you several weeks to obtain the currency necessary to craft it (Legendary Insights x150 for first set, x300 for subsequent sets). When I was new and set out to work on the collections I had completed all of the steps without much effort for the steps inside the raid and long before I had enough LI to craft the first set.
---
You can put it on dune cloak.
---
Interesting. I got around 20s so far but I'm not using swiftness. Didn't even think of that.
---
My order is slightly different. The last two are switched for me. And I don't jump up the high wall, but use the normal path to the one that's last in your video.
---
North, to ~~Vabbi~~ the Far Shiverpeaks
---
The Charr patent control their inventions and sue anyone who tries to build their equipment. It's their way of continuing to exact revenge on the other races of Tyria.
---
There is an abandoned field near my home.  It's an empty lot, full of weeds, and people tend to toss garbage there, and let their dogs poop without bothering to clean it up.
---
During the summer the municipality has a crew mow the grass a couple of times, when it gets really tall.  It certainly helps, but doesn't change what the lot is, or what it is used for.
---
They dont make those infusions for the couple of players that will get it, they make them for the thousands of players that want it and keep logging into the map to do the daily meta.
---
Not even close. The raid guides were always bad even before they were outdated. Achievement guides were handy but the wiki had the same information, usually with more detail. JP guides were always lackluster, and made obsolete by AiynMaiden's video guides. The cosmetics showcases were annoying because he refused to link image galleries, instead linking directly to the website.
---
Never apologize to food.
---
Just giving my perspective on them since every time someone mentions they are having trouble getting into raid content, the template response is "check out these Discord groups, it's super easy! You'll be raiding in no time!"
---
That has not been my experience. My experience has been responding to every "add reaction for role" ping that pops up while I am playing, and seeing familiar names pulled in to each raid, and familiar names repeatedly ignored each raid.
---
And it's not as if I have been chalked up as a lost cause and am being unanimously ghosted. I haven't been in a group or had a personal interaction with a trainer yet.
---
I'm not expecting anything here. I appreciate the idea behind what the Discord groups are meant to be doing, and maybe they are doing that for some people. That's great. But it's also possible to join those Discords based on a reddit rec and spend weeks trying to get into a group with no success at all.
---
Amazing!  Great work :D
---
No matter what time of day I log in, as I walk around DR I see people wearing sunglasses.  
---
Now I know why.
---
Because until now you had to own a specific expansion to use those. They couldn't add HoT mastery stuff to PoF content because not everyone owned HoT. I fully expect them to start putting these in now that HoT comes with PoF.
---
Play power chrono(?) c:
---
Can you link a video of what comes out the other end?  It would be nice if all professions had access to rocket boots - just sayin'
---
Dragonfall proved that they could do with optional stuff. Same with the few places you can find updrafts in jahai bluffs
---
That is definitely the Hall of Monuments. Considering the age of the map I would assume that Anet just placed the map in the wrong location initially, which is something they fixed before the game launched.
---
Nice golden colored skin glow.
---
Can you check, if the [stat change recipes on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Khan-Ur) are correct?
---
If I am not mistaken, the recipes on the wiki are wrong and require Hatched Chilis instead of Mystic Coins but I couldnt confirm since i dont have the infusion.
---
All you had to do was rip his throat out...just sayin'.
---
Lol. Convenient perspective to have when you can't respond to what I said.  
---
Doubly funny when that is how I'm being treated in here without discussion.  
---
He said axe, yeah well we have 2 other condi weps that we'd be using in it's place?   
---
It's mirage exclusive? so was shield and a lot of Chrono builds don't use it.  
---
He points out the ambush skills, which is what I want fixed. and to summarize he said "condi weapons do condi ambushes" Which is just to be expected. I'm not ignoring context the context you are ignoring is that the power weapons don't apply condis. So why do they even have ambushes? should they even bother to exist? That is the part you people are ignoring.  
---
Self deception is a clone generation skill, like on chrono, like on deceptive evasion. Other than jaunt you slot 1 more deception on your bar and cannot alone being the defining factor.  
---
I don't think any of these are unreasonable points if that is where you go, then it is you who doesn't want to have a conversation and are just projecting because in your head you are flat out right, as opposed to being able to think "hmm maybe it wouldn't be so hard to make power mirage do enough damage to at least be playable"
---
Alright bud. Have fun with that.
---
Adventures. Do them daily and you get huge amounts of XP. Stick with ones you can get Gold easily. They are once a day.
---
Leyline Run is actually easy to get gold. It's just that the descriptions for the skills gained are awful. www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1UgvAOgIrM
---
Might want to check out for other Adventure Gold tutorials on Youtube.
---
I enjoyed the showcase, but all i learned from this is that the Liquid Aurillium just gives you stink clouds
---
People have severely unrealistic views of raiding and see a glass ele that needs to be revived 5 times as being more valuable than someone tougher that does comparable DPS but doesn't die even though there's only 1 DPS check boss.
---
So to earn fractal 20 and higher you just need to keep completing fractals?
---
Thanks for help. I found that my cheap keyboard was malfunctioning.
---
If you look at the table, he is shedding his leafs...
---
It's the exterior map we dont actually get to see :p
---
haha.
---
Eating too much Zhaitaffy already makes your character puke, so maybe we get some Montezuma's Revenge Halloween Treats this year
---
This is a nice add to the game. Having food with visual effect looks fun.
---
i would wish for a system that just excludes enemys. if i set it to medium i want to see some player. yes, i want to feel like this is actually group content with some players around. aslong as i see all enemys
---
if the fps drops below 10 again, hey you can allways lower the limit to 0 other players.
---
You wont earn extra mastery points for doing it on other races. The points are indeed bound to the first time you go through those story-level steps, whatever the race.
---
That's the Chrono not the Druid you goober
---
Nice artwork. 
---
The Springer reminds me of hare from Monster Rancher.
---
It's the first of each level block you complete, regardless of race. I originally thought they all counted, but after some other topics ages ago I counted the ones I had and it only fit if I included each level block once.
---
shatterer, tequatl and claw of jormag are technicly not characters, but constructs and therefor uneffected by character model limits.
---
for example: if i put the limit to low, i cant see the boss ghost in grothmar, i cant see the devourer at the flame legion burning man, i cant see the oozes in the pit (even the legy one) and i cant even see the bandmembers of metal legion. thats basicly every important enemy/character on the new map, which is infuriating!
---
My bad. You think Druid, you right away look at the walking cabbage.
---
The thing is you actually need some masteries to do those sometimes lmao. I was trying out the mushroom race - when I arrived for the first time with a pretty good run and I didn't even get bronze, I realized I didn't stand a chance without the speed shrooms.
---
Noice!
---
yeah. we had one player on dhum cm that was not seeing the echo, aside from the moving symbol on the minimap.
---
thats the real cm, play blind!
---
It looks amazing
---
Hey man.  Just you wait until 3 years from now when I get 900% magic find and finally open all my bags.
---
This is the best advice.   If you have left over consider getting the silver-fed for yellows.  I've heard runecrafters is trash through.
---
Why not play chrono? Because it feels very different, doubly so after they got rid of illusionary persona and distortion.  
---
The remedy isn't all that difficult either and can be done without breaking anything else or stepping on condi's toes. This could be done through the lesser used traits, particularly dune cloak. If in addition to it's boon strip (which should be a true strip), clones had 100% of the mesmers damage for auto attacks, as well as it buffing jaunt's damage we could have something almost functional.  This way Phantasms become a burst before the sustain, instead of spamming phantasms for the sustain, while sacrificing everything for that, on something that frankly now feels clucky (chrono).
---
Thank you all who have tried to help. Unfortunately none of these worked. I submitted a ticket to support. Hopefully they will be able to find a solution.
---
I'm getting a lot of flickering / screen tearing when zooming around in the world map.
---
I had no idea Evon is Ash Legion.
---
They should just buff it so it's viable. I don't see why this is a problem, and frankly I think it only turns people off from raids... Then raiders be like "y no one want to raid?"  
---
If pvp is the issue, well it's a sinking ship and they already know how to split, should just focus on the things that can be salvaged, like raids. IMO sPvP should just be it's separate client.
---
Never Ever.
---
Dude GW2 mount system is incredible.. and as a whole GW2 is an incredible game. It’s taken me quite awhile to figure it out and get into it but damn I am super into now that I get how to play the game and progress
---
thx
---
This is what I use.  Very happy with it.
---
It’s in Low Power Mode.
---
These always make me smile more than they reasonably should.
---
I'm impressed they even made it through the expansions at lvl64

[BLOG] [The Guild Wars 2 Team posted on September 30, 2019](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/learn-all-about-build-and-equipment-templates/):
---
 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;    In April, we announced that we’ve been working on a much-requested feature for *Guild Wars 2*: templates. They’ve been in development for a long time, and today we’re finally pulling back the curtain on how the feature works. We’re looking forward to getting it into your hands so we can hear your feedback and continue to build on it! We’re happy to announce that we’ll release *Guild Wars 2* templates on October 29!
---
&gt;A character’s combat customization is split into two parts. The first is your choice of utility skills, specializations, and major trait choices. The second is your choice of equipment, along with any attribute choices and upgrades. The system we developed reflects this, giving you access to two separate types of templates: Build Templates and Equipment Templates.
---
&gt;Because these are separate from each other, you can create multiple Build Templates that work with a single Equipment Template—and vice versa. At release, each template tab will have its own key bind, allowing you to quickly change to the template that best suits your moment-to-moment gameplay. Swapping can be done whenever you’re out of combat, with limitations in competitive modes.
---
&gt;### Build Templates
---
&gt;[[https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3443cEN_Build-590x446.png](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3443cEN_Build-590x446.png)](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3443cEN_Build.png)
---
&gt;A Build Template stores a set of utility skills, specialization lines, and major trait choices. You’ll find your character’s Build Templates in the Hero panel, within the Build tab. With the click of a button, you can swap between Build Template tabs to activate a different Build Template. You can copy the contents of one Build Template tab to another, rename it, and clear it completely. You can also preview your character’s inactive Build Template tabs by hovering over the tab to view a short summary of its contents.
---
&gt;A Build Template tab can hold any Build Template that matches your character’s profession. Even if you haven’t trained all the skills or specialization lines used by a Build Template, you can keep it in your active Build Template tab. The unobtained elements will be automatically equipped once they’ve been trained from the Training tab.
---
&gt;At release, each character will get three Build Template tabs, which will be preloaded with their existing equipped builds from PvE, PvP, and WvW. You can swap the contents of the Build Template tabs for use in any game mode or purchase more tabs from the Gem Store.
---
&gt;#### Build Template Sharing
---
&gt;Build Templates can also be copied as a chat link in the game. You can send them to friends to help them prepare for a raid—or to your enemies to boast of your superior build. These chat links can also be copied and pasted out of the game and back into it from your clipboard, making trying a new build from another player or an external website a breeze.
---
&gt;Each Build Template chat link shows a small preview of its contents, but you can dive into it by clicking on the chat link to bring up the Inspect panel. In this panel, you can view the contents of a Build Template the same way it would appear on your Build tab, with full tooltips for each skill and trait. If any parts of the template are unavailable to your character, this will be noted.
---
&gt;[[https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/e62b2EN_Storage.png](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/e62b2EN_Storage.png)](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/e62b2EN_Storage.png)
---
&gt;If the Build Template you’re inspecting is for a different profession than the one you’re logged in with and playing, you can store it in your account-wide Build Storage. Unlike Build Template tabs, Build Storage can hold templates of any profession and can be accessed by any character on your account. You can copy, rename, clear, or inspect them the same way you would a Build Template tab, and copy and paste a template to and from tabs and storage (provided your character is the appropriate profession to apply the template to a tab).
---
&gt;Your account will have access to three Build Storage Spaces for free. To obtain more, you can purchase them in packs of three in the Gem Store. For a limited time after release, you’ll be able to pick up a free pack in the Gem Store for a total of six free Build Storage Spaces.
---
&gt;### Equipment Templates
---
&gt;[[https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/e3db0EN_Equipment-590x459.png](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/e3db0EN_Equipment-590x459.png)](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/e3db0EN_Equipment.png)
---
&gt;Your character’s equipment, attributes, and upgrades—excluding gathering tools—can be stored in Equipment Templates. To add an item to an Equipment Template, navigate to the Equipment Template tab you want to store the template in and equip your item.
---
&gt;Items you add to Equipment Templates will no longer take up space in your character’s inventory, and you can reuse them across each of that character’s Equipment Templates. Items stored in this fashion will display a link icon in the upper corner and additional tooltip information listing all the Equipment Templates you’ve used them in.
---
&gt;Equipment Templates can also record the customization of legendary items, which can freely change attributes and upgrades. You can equip a single legendary item to multiple Equipment Templates with different attributes and upgrade choices for each.
---
&gt;You can copy and paste an Equipment Template from one tab to another, rename it, or empty it of all items (including attributes and upgrades). The latter will return any items not used in other templates to your normal inventory.
---
&gt;Hover your mouse cursor over an Equipment Template tab for a short summary of the Equipment Template stored in it, including weapon types and total stats from the items it references (excluding upgrades).
---
&gt;Each of your characters will have access to two Equipment Template tabs for free, and the first will be automatically populated with an Equipment Template containing the gear your character was wearing when you last logged in. You can purchase additional Equipment Template tabs from the Gem Store.
---
&gt;### What’s Next
---
&gt;PvP equipment works much differently than PvE and WvW equipment, so it will require its own template system. Because this presents different technological challenges, we chose not to delay the release of the completed Build and Equipment Templates. We’re looking forward to hearing what you think of the bulk of the feature, and your detailed feedback will be very helpful to us as we continue developing PvP Equipment Templates.
---
&gt;Join us tomorrow on Tuesday, October 1 at noon Pacific Time for a live Guild Chat preview of Build and Equipment Templates on the official [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/guildwars2/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/arenanetofficial/live), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GuildWars2/live) channels! We’ll dive into the unique challenges we faced and the solutions we uncovered. If you have questions about templates, please post them in [this forum thread]() and we’ll answer as many as we can on the stream.

---
For me it was an RTSS problem. I followed the advice on the dev discord to clear the RTSS cache and the game launched. Open RTSS -&gt; Setup -&gt; Reset cache (at the bottom). If you don't have RTSS then I don't know. Tagging /u/akera099 and /u/ScROnZ too.
---
&gt; Items you add to Equipment Templates will no longer take up space in your character’s inventor
---
And the build templates* are shareable via chat links as well? This is definitely exceeding my expectations! Nice.
---
Only 3 people spending real life money probably isn't ideal. Unless it's Bernard Arnault trying to win fashion wars in game after he won it IRL.
---
Anet: This is our system and all this functionalities: chat links, UI, inventory management, keybinds, sharability, coherence in the current design, an on top of that we are being transparent about monetization. Happy?
---
Reddit: Monetization. Booo.
---
I've been hoping for skin templates too. Perhaps we'll get lucky and the system they've built will allow them to easily add that as a third kind of template.
---
this was about to be expected that they will sell additional slots.  
---
the important thing here will be  
---
* maximum slots  
---
* ease of use with many templates (shortcut window?)  
---
* price of each additional template
---
I'm still gonna hold off on using this for at least a couple days.
---
Things've been pretty buggy on launch recently, and a template system that interacts with my gear / possibly removes it from the inventory sounds risky as hell.
---
&gt; because of the chat codes
---
shut up and delet this before they realize
---
I play ele 95% of the time. I have over 10 different stat sets that I use regularly.
---
So we have to pay for more build templates on each character, and then pay more to store more of them account-wide?
---
build are account wide
---
equipment are per character
---
So hope you dont main chrono
---
Paying for extra gear storage I understand.  
---
Paying for extra build space can fuck right off. Idk about y'all but I'm just gonna straight up revert to saving the build codes in a notepad doc. That shit's free.
---
How so, when I'll have to click everything because I don't have any template slots left ?
---
Source.
---
Not to say that makes it okay, but this is the exact excuse Square Enix uses when you ask them about the hard cap on inventory/gear storage space in FFXIV - they don't even *allow you* to buy more slots.
---
If you have millions of players, it actually *is* more of a problem than you probably think.
---
If you are surprised by anet monetizing this, idk what server you've been playing on.
---
Why would anet invest thousands of manpower hours into something that they cannot profit from? This game has no sub fee, and they need to make their profits somehow. The fact that we get one additional slot more than we already have (for free) is already quite generous.
---
Some clarification on this would be nice.
---
Only 3 or 3 for each game mode?
---
FINALLY !!!
---
That depends on your equipment.
---
Don't forget poor mesmer with at least 4 different builds just for raiding.
---
I imagine you'll have to manually unequip it from your hero panel and then put it in accound-wide slots or the bank to transfer the items to another character. Just like it works now.
---
Aaaaand more than 2 are gemstore locked... Fuck this company.
---
&gt;Not better than Arc, perhaps
---
That's kinda the point though. I don't want to have an update make my gameplay experience worse? 
---
The whole point of build templates is to speed up downtime between changing builds. Having to do something like that is almost as bad as just swapping the gear.
---
Having to jump through hoops to swap my gear is what I'm using build templates to avoid.
---
Some people will complain that it's 3 free slots and 3 additional gemstore slots but I feel that's very fair. There will be less character slots sold in the future, that has to be balanced out.
---
well, if we can still transmog the different EQUIPMENT rather than have like a overlaying skin, that could mean it cna be used as a skin template too
---
Hm, I must have missed the part of the blog post that said you had to buy access to the system as a whole. As far as I understood it you would get access to the whole system, including a bunch of slots for free? 
---
Feel free to point out what I missed.
---
Build templates stored on your account 3 free slots and 3 free additional slots for a short time at release. Might want to clarify that it won't last forever.
---
That's the best outcome I could've had. ^:D
---
Yeah i was surprised that the topics that asked for this got weird answers even though it is very obvious for me and other ele friends that hp need to be upped because we are no longer playing the core game and we are no longer the only glass cannons and those others have a lot more hp then we do. Makes zero sense to me.
---
Let's just hope it won't be a barely functioning buggy mess for months after release. I don't have much faith in it tho. No way it's going to be better than arc..
---
Obviously. Otherwise there would be no point of templates.
---
I'm sure they realize it already and are probably just preying on folks who want all their builds to be swappable instantly for the monetization. :) 
---
They wouldn't let us have chat codes at all if they were that concerned about this lol.
---
He's using "invest" in the sense of "buy something worthwhile", not the sense of "put money into now for a return later". #homonyms
---
I wouldn't mind if can make more templates for free but with my stuff still in my Inventory like it is now
---
It's like 1 kb of data per template. They can manage easily.
---
Chat links for builds/gear will inevitably lead to build/gear checks for Raids and high level Fractals when using LFG. Wont this lead to people only accepting people into groups who are fully min/maxed?
---
Always found it a bit freaky how undead that gas mask looks. Especially combined with how the image's colour scheme reminds you of Zhaitan and his Risen. Probably intentional but I've got no idea why.
---
depends on the price.  In reality, a build template slot is only saving you somewhere between 0 and 16 inventory slots, and unlike inventory expansion, it is a lot more restrictive in how you use it.  If its priced appropriately it could be fine.
---
ok so heres the thing, as far as i remember the agreement back in the day was that deltaconnecteds buildtemllates will be tolerated for as long as theres no template system in game, and hes expected to remove them after that
---
It really isn't :/
---
This is true but not stopping links will keep on destroying WvW further until there is very little left to move over to alliances which even the most hard core players have realised wont change anything anymore. 
---
But merging and making tournament would have been faster and also probably done years ago.
---
Just save your chat codes for your builds and you have infinite storage space. Only limitation is you won't be able to swap with a single button press - more like 2-3, depending on how long it takes you to copy/paste from a text document or guild MOTD. :)
---
Can't spell Gnashblade without Ash.
---
\#arctemplate
---
Why are you complainign about a class needing surviability while also making a point where it needs to be viable in raids. You do know a spec doesnt need to have survivability to make it useful a dps spot right?
---
27 specs, default condi vs power vs support builds. Not enough templates here.
---
They're just regular chat links. If people can like \[250 Twilight\] and \[999 Raid Currency\], I don't see why they couldn't link whatever build someone requests.
---
That's hilariously terrible :D
---
Kinda reminds me of the monster hunter icons! I love em ♥
---
I like it far more than I expected to, and I love how just using my existing dye choices from the other Jackal skins I have, they all just look fantastic.
---
Also surprisingly, this doesn't look weird with a full grown male Charr riding it.
---
That all said, I still think the Shrine Guardian is the #1 mount skin in the game, and QQ because I don't have it.
---
this will need a small UI to select templates.  
---
keybinds are neat, but i dont think i will remember 12 different templates that all only have minor differences.
---
they're literally said from the start that support for Arc (build tempaltes) has to stop when "real" build templates are released.
---
[Correct](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cz1rrb/build_templates_only_available_with_legendary/eywxzz9/)
---
*Spongebob screaming: YES*
---
Problem is, for pve anyways, that if you don't wanna overwrite food, you need diff toons anyways.  If you could swap food without overwriting, then I'd say more than 2 is required.  At this point though, best to just have different toons imo.
---
I'm fine with it. ArenaNet needs to make money and even two is amazing. I'll happily pay for 3/4 eventually if needed.
---
You also can diversify what characters you play. Have daredevil builds on one character and deadeye ones on other character. Should be okay like that with free slots ( +- ) and nowadays with all the teleportation tomes and infinite port to friend it is easy to play on more characters.
---
Fair enough, good point. Easy enough to fake it I'd imagine.
---
Didn't think it was necessary, I assumed anyone reading this and hyped about build templates would check them out at release. But I did clarify it now, thanks!
---
Imagine paying gems for a slot when you can literally just save the chat codes for builds to a guild MOTD or text document.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
It is looking VERY good, my one and only concern, do they get additional slots gem pricing right, because this is only thing that can blew it for me right now.
---
Kill me
---
Well yes, but don't forget you basically get free bag space with each equip template, so one can expect that it wil lcost something.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/short-story-evon-gnashblade-disembarks/
---
Level 64 after completing them. Color me doubtful. Isn't level 80 *required* to start the story anyway?
---
IM HYPED AF BOYS
---
Yea, I am pretty sure after the official templates come out using the arc templates will most likely result in a ban
---
About damn time! Woo
---
Yeah, if you live in 1994.
---
Deduplication is a thing. Why do you think they separated eq from traits+skills? because they can deduplicate the latter easily. And storing eq is just ~~190~~ 400 bytes uncompressed (maximum 40 bytes: 2 item id, 8 dyes, 2 skin id, 2x2 upgrade id, 2x2 infusion id). 1mil eq builds is a whopping ~~190~~ 400 MB and 80% playerbase is just going to use a single one anyway. Wow much server space. One day of global chat logs takes more. Hell, one day of webserver access logs takes more with just 200k users.
---
Gotta love that, before its even out, and HEY get them gems ready, get ready for them 1000 gems upgrades, that you all asked for, ( they will also likely be character upgrades instead of account so choose wisely ) glad i play necro now, given that anet just nerfed them to dirt, i wont need the templates, feel bad for Mesmer players, and or Guardian players, you may be better sticking with ARC for templates than anets cash shop.
---
you want to put a 200% damage modifer on a single grandmaster?
---
Your suggestion of 300-500 gems for a character bound tab is over priced imo.  A bag slot is at least 20 inventory slots for 400 gems and can be used for more than just storing equipment.  Built tab only saves you at most 16 inventory slots, and is restrictive on what can go there.
---
The fact that they're monetizing this kinda killed any hype I had, it's extra shitty if this kills the arc templates. Not putting any dime to this
---
2 equipment slots? Probably enough since I never change my equipment. Now 3 build slots? That might be tight. Overall it's still a disgusting corporate decision obviously.
---
so we have limited build template space in a feature that should have been in game since launch day and that had no storage limit in gw1, great...
---
Are there template add-ons any other than Arc? I know that Arc's developer has already said he'll shut down his templates when an official system is out so ANet won't have to do anything about that.
---
I have to assume that, since there is more in the works for PvP and WvW as stated in the post, there *will* be 2 or 3 slots per game mode down the line, but for the time being you have to share the slots you have across them all.
---
I could very well be wrong, though.
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9c1khm/after_all_this_years_after_wardrobe_novelties/e57ga57/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) is just one instance, in every thread about Build Templates there were several people who proposed it, just use the search function.
---
is this a joke?
---
i have 9 builds just on reve
---
Press F to pay respects.
---
no, for the most part you can ignore the account wide build template storage. Think of it as a bank for templates.  But its pointless because if you want to store all those builds, just store the chat link in a text file.  You could even store it in game in a personal guild hall message.
---
Intentionally done. This is the promo image for the commando class April fools joke Anet did during beta.
---
That said I would totally buy this in game, even if it was an outfit.
---
My main question so far:
---
can you also link the build template to the equipment template and activate them via a key bind together?
---
arc will be not allow when this is released
---
That's what I thought would be the most obvious usage scenario. I was just a little thrown by it not being mentioned at all. I guess we should presume that a new soulbound mechanic isn't being introduced if it isn't stated!
---
Are they seriously charging for this? WTF!?!?
---
don't forget, personal guild hall message should work too, depending on how many you have.
---
Soulbeast wasn’t Ky? 
---
Awesome kill! This is very impressive. Keep up the great work! It’s an inspiration to plebes like me. :)
---
You still don't get it. The "you are doing it wrong" is just a perceptive opinion of a person, in this case **you**. That's only your way of doing things. However, that's not the *global* way of thinking, as the class allows for quite some versatility and each of us choose our limits. It's perfectly fine to swap attunements on emergencies, even if you don't like it/understand it/limit yourself, etc.  
---
Think outside of the DPS box. It's not bad to be a glass cannon DPS 95% of the time and a emergency healer a 5% of the time if it works.
---
Paul please, clarify before reddit blow up. 
---
So what this means is, we cannot have an infinite amount of just build templates links for our characters? To switch from our own personal character bags and not the equipment bag? If we want more than 2 builds per character, we need to buy more slots just to be able to swap, bag inventory aside?
---
I'm pretty sure arc templates will be discontinued when this update launches. I've heard the developer agreed to stop support on them when it's available in-game.
---
What’s ridiculous is having 20 armor sets for one character
---
None of that would matter if templates weren't editable because they would become useless after a few balance patches. 
---
There's no main point, all of it matters.
---
Any profession that would need more than 2 equipment sets, is already shared by 2+ characters anyway so it means 4+ equipment slots for free. And anyway 2 is enough for most uses, I'll gladly support with some gems if I happen to need more. I know some people are going crazy with minmaxing and use quite more than 2 sets on a character (sometimes with only slight differences) but I think 2 equipment tabs will be perfect for most players. Also, they kinda count as storage.
---
You don't have a choice (short of not playing). Your currently equipped gear is automatically going into an Equipment Template when you log into each character the first time.
---
Lmfao.... I would consider this P2W. Please arcdps, continue supporting your mod. Rather support your tool than funnel into this diabolical monetization scheme.
---
Edit: thx autocorrect
---
Its literaly like buying bag space. They are charging for the fact we wont need anything in our inv to switch the template
---
So it wasn't them trying to figure out how to do it, that took so long.  It was how they were going to monotize the most requested feature since launch.  GG ANET  Notepad and chat code here I come.
---
I'm fucking disgusted. This is the greediest move I've ever seen from ArenaNet and I'm legitimately disgusted by it.
---
Three build templates per character - if you play one character in all three gamemodes congrats, your three templates are used.
---
Three account-wide build storage templates - six if you count the limited edition free pack of three. This is probably the least offensive, purely because most people don't have dozens of characters that need builds and I assume you can clear these out once you transfer a stored build to the characters you want to run it. Still a *grossly small* limit though, considering this game lets you have up to 69 characters.
---
Two equipment templates per character - most people I know have at *least* two sets of armour for their most played characters at level 80, and sometimes more. Similarly, I have to ask; what's the fucking point of legendary armour and legendary weapons if you will limit the people who worked *fucking hard* to complete those items to *two* equipment templates? You know, with the armour that allows you to be any stat in the game and change on the fly - which was the entire point and appeal of legendary gear? 
---
This is actually shameful from ArenaNet. Nowhere else in the game are they this fucking greedy for ***legitimate game functions***. Crafting professions? Well you can have *all* of them, but only two *active*. The fee to switch isn't bad. Bag slots? You're given *more* than enough for a character to get all the way to 80 and then some, especially as you can invest in larger bags in those slots. Bank slots was perhaps the most obvious "probably need to put money into a couple of extra tabs" but these tabs are *account wide* and so impact every character you ever make. 
---
To paywall the likes of build and equipment templates in a game that fucking prided itself on the amount of builds it wanted to let you play is the lowest of the fucking low I've seen this company sink, and nothing has ever wanted to make me say "Hey ArenaNet? Fuck you" more than this.
---
Also you can have the perfect build needed for the LFG saved in a slot, but use another one.
---
Well, I know what I'm gonna use those storage guild MotD for.
---
I dont see them blocking ARC, as you use it at your own risk, i cant see that changing.
---
clarify what you are asking. Build template != equipment template
---
&gt; So are they saying, you get 3 build tabs for free, but they will automatically be populated by existing PvE, PvP and WvW? 
---
The lower part of the post says that PvP builds are for now their own separate system and unaffected, so worst case scenario, you get 1 essentially empty slot to use:
---
&gt; PvP equipment works much differently than PvE and WvW equipment, so it will require its own template system. Because this presents different technological challenges, we chose not to delay the release of the completed Build and Equipment Templates.
---
From my understanding, honestly... i kind of expected worse than this. Theres still some information missing but im not going to cry about saying this system should have been in the game years ago. It seems pretty fun and quite frankly ive been too lazy to remember builds. I have soooo much gear that im looking forward to trying out new builds. This seems the fairest way of doing things as we all should have realised the system needed monetising.  
---
I genuinly thought the system was also a long way off. So .... Really good news. I know near the end of the Software developers don't like putting out big patches. If there are issues, atleast that gives them a bit of time to fix them prior to any christmas holidays
---
Rather than actually storing them account wide, just copy the chat link for builds on your one character before swapping to another, then save a copy there. 
---
Do this and you can just use your account-wide space for overflow of your favorite builds, or to hold some in your back pocket while playing on a different class, as the article suggests.
---
Its not equal.  Especially if you have legendary armor, then each tab is only worth at most 10 inventory slots, and again you can't put any items you want there, only specifics.  
---
My chrono has legendary weapons,armor,trinkets.  Each build tab for her is only going to be 4 inventory slots or so (depending on weapon).
---
I don't have 20 armor sets, I have one armor set, legendary. I have 4 different rune sets, and I use more than 2 different stat combinations on my legendary armor over those templates.
---
I mean... this has been a feature that took 7 years to finally implement, the basics of which have existed in every MMO for over a decade now, and their first game literally had it... and now they want to charge people for it. That’s kind of scummy.
---
If it's 400 gems for a slot then it should be fine but knowing them it's more like 1200.
---
just save them in a bank guild message
---
Build storage is basically meaningless dude. Its just when someone links you a build for a different Charaktere. 
---
3 Normal build templates and only 2 normal Equip tempsa are the problem.
---
Lets not raise pitchforks before we know a price.
---
I'm asking about build templates, i don't care about the free slots from equipment templates, i'm asking if we need to pay to just be able to switch builds from our own character bags like arc dps
---
Can multiple characters use the same equipment template? (I’m guessing not but a man can dream)
---
Awfully limiting, if there's an actual hard cap to how many we can make. Not to mention the actual cost. 
---
The reality is that given what we have, some people are losing even more Quality of Life. The game becomes harder to play for Mesmer, Ele, Ranger, and guardians, and in a way that makes them spend time looking at their UI rather than playing the game.
---
I really hope they reconsider the numbers shown here.
---
I was honestly happy but then I kept reading. Arenanet doesn’t understand players who raid or wvw. We have at least 3 builds per class. And much raiders and wvw players use multiple classes. Anet giving a free pack that adds 3 build tabs to their 3 is not enough. If arenanet bans arcdps there will be a big demand for arenanet to give more then 6 tabs in the beginning. Their needs to be at least 10-15 tabs for free. Why gw1 build templates free but gw2 is charging so much is dumb. So I’ll still be using arc unless the tab packs are like 5 gems a pack.
---
I agree about what you say on the staff, but about anyone dying or not, the person above mixed a lot of things together that i did not even said and made assumptions so far of from my topic that it became hilarious. My first post was about glass build on ele in PvE. I was very clear about this in that post.
---
If we move over to WvW then you don't play WvW on a 11 k hp ele because you will be dead more then you are alive. And there is were my point is as well. Other glass professions are able to play glass builds because their hp is not that low. They will still die a lot but they can still choose to do it. As a ele sure you can but yeah even the ambients will kill you more often then not. 
---
And if we are talking about WvW and helping people then everybody on my server know that i am a stubborn tempest player who have no issues of swapping to support to keep my party or fellow players up. In fact most players know this so well that they usually move to me if they are low becaus they know i will help if i can. 
---
But i felt it is rather pointless info for others to read about this because it has nothing to do with what my first post said. But now that is also cleared out :)
---
Halloween outfit? That would be great!
---
Oh my god a business wants to make money thats it call the police this is clearly an international crime arrest everyone at Anet for wanting to make money. Dude grow up. Does it suck yes of course it does everyone likes getting stuff for free but you don't if you can't accept it don't buy the templates simple as.
---
Thx for the video, but dam infusion really are the fashion cancer of this game, this is ugly as fuck.
---
Dyes are already stored with the item so yes, it's a "looks template" too as long as you have multiple EQ sets to put the looks on.
---
The three free ones are a joke, as we already "had" them for pvp, pve and wvw~ what bothers me most is how legendary stuff uses the exact same amount of equip plates - they are literally pointless
---
Templates aren't armor sets.
---
how is this going to handle runes and sigils inside legendary armor/weapons?
---
that one didnt age well =)
---
And it lookes like even if you have a character with full legendaries you would still have to pay for EVERY. EXTRA. TEMPLATE. Kinda kills the purpose of them also since the gemstore stuff looks better anyway. Fuck PvP, PvE, WvW, Fractals, Dungeons or Raids, the endgame content is PvGemstore
---
All of you ass hats were crying for templates to show up and the majority would even claim that they WOULD BE HAPPY even if it was a gem store exclusive addition! And now you're all going to bitch about it? 
---
You even get some for free. Ungrateful sacks of water.
---
It’s a free solution and workaround, just disappointing that it’s gonna be clunkier than arcdps especially given arc had unlimited free slots. Oh well
---
**THIS HAS TO BECOME THIS SUB'S MOST VOTED THREAD EVER. LET'S GO PEOPLE, WE CAN DO IT.**
---
Quit now while you can, kid. Do us all a favor, please.
---
According to the link it's 3 free per *account* for the builds, and 2 free per *character* for the equipment.
---
Also for a limited time after release, you can buy 3 more build slots from the gem store for 0 gems, for a total of 6.
---
With 6 for me that's 2 versions of 3 professions, so currently I'll probably do power and boon Chrono, Condi and quick brand, and Condi and support scourge.
---
I think they should offer some sort of retroactive discount like half price build slots for each new character slot you've bought in the past or something, but I don't expect it.
---
You forget the fact many other games had this since before GW2, for free, including GW1.
---
You also forget this took 7 stupid years to implement when, again, other games shipped with it.
---
You also also seem to forget THEY WILL CHARGE FOR THIS. Charging, for templates, in a game where they KNOW people have a lot of them for PvP/WvW and raids.
---
I'm curious how the build templates and build storage spaces work. Is it 3 build templates per storage space?
---
So why is it ok that other glass cannons which have more dps and also can be the glass cannon from stealth like the thief. Why do they need so much more hp then ele do?
---
With full legendary armor on my mesmer and about 8 different builds for equipment in arcdps it kind of feels like a downgrade. Tbh I would probably be better of with 4 mesmer characters and 2 ascended sets on each of them. But I'll wait for the pricing and the actual implementation. We'll see...
---
would a popup menu that switches between anet templates be allowed?
---
ah we were discussing 2 different things.  
---
i just (pendatically?) pointed out that editing the template is not the mainfunction, but you carried on the actual discussion.  
---
nothing to see here. carry on.
---
Oh no some one came into my rant/whine thread and posted a rational comment with a different opinion than mine, better insult them like a child!
---
Equipment templates per character?
---
I can understand the difficulty dealing with soulbound exotics...  But this does nothing for us that use legendary gear for multiple professions.  Kinda defeats the purpose of account bound.
---
 I'd pay money to be able to load account bound equipment on different classes..  Now that would be a premium feature. Not this BS where I still have to unload equipment to use it on another character. 
---
Right now you are selling us something lesser than what we got in GW1 for free, lesser than you are taking away from us that arc provided.
---
Making more character's and equipping them is still more convenient and cost effective if these cost anymore than a character slot.  And we can have way more of those.
---
you did announced templates in april...... 2014.
---
Bbbut fashion wars! Character worth is based on your looks, so if you can't show it to people because they have it turned off, then whats the point of having legendaries??
---
/s
---
Dude. 
---
YTA. Big time. 
---
Do you call everyone that does not agree with you an Anet sympathisant.
---
Sure i agree that op is too aggressive about it, but i do find it weird that most comments basically call him an idiot when i think most would agree that build diversity is a good thing.
---
Because they will remove the compatibility of arc.. so you have to use their templates
---
If you been here all this years we asked for this. We even said that we would buy it all from the gem store if they just added it. This been said in so many ways which means we already gave them that thought and there by accepted it.
---
Gw2 has raids?
---
Does Delta release a new update of Arc for *every* game update?
---
That's insane, but also pretty convenient in this situation. I think in the past when that one tolerated/allowed dps meter added a forbidden functionality, ANet had to give people some grace period to switch off that version.
---
Op just pay them 15 dollars a month like other games with unlimited build templates.  Ez
---
Yes that’s how I noticed the issue a few weeks ago . I increased my points by 2 and it went from 11-13 but went from 10-12 in GW2. My points were always 1 less in GW2 for some reason even though HoM Rewards site and GW1 show one more.
---
&gt;**~~At release, each character will get three Build Template tabs~~**~~, which will be preloaded with their existing equipped builds from PvE, PvP, and WvW. You can swap the contents of the Build Template tabs for use in any game mode or purchase more tabs from the Gem Store.~~
---
~~read it again, don't spread false things.~~
---
nvm i just read the rest.
---
Decide what it was: flickering or screen tearing. Screen tearing can be caused due to wrongly configured vsync/gync settings in game and gpu driver. Flickering can be due to some shader cache miss. Or in the end try to troubleshoot, read about it in readme.
---
Not me, actually. But, see, I've been around long enough and observed these arguments enough to realize that my personal reasons for playing cannot be mapped onto the entire population. Different people will always like different things. 
---
Also, the other cool thing about this map is that ANet is allowing poor players who would never get this infusion to profit off of its rarity, by allowing them to sell the tokens to open the chest. That lets them make some money, and lets the players who just want to chase the dragon (heh) save some time. Everyone wins. Everyone gets to pursue their goals with the map.
---
You cannot copy/paste equipment, so it's not just two clicks: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dbhj8j/build_templates_coming_next_month/f21ugws/
---
It's also not really 'dozens' of slots. Swapping my legendary armour from chrono to mirage used two slots, runes and infusions. Swapping from chrono to condi support chrono is also runes and infusions. Swapping my toughness and build is 0 slots. I don't really care about so few slots.
---
This is going to be a downgrade for me and a lot of other players (most serious raiders use arc + build templates). I think that this is kinda the right move for ArenaNet? But don't dress it up and pretend it's going to give me some massive benefit. I'm just going to have to fork over a bunch of gems to get what I had better and for free.
---
Not for long. He said he won’t support it anymore after they release the official version
---
I love it, it's essentially a legendary looking mount skin with all the effects and animations it has going for it. My only complaint, I wish there was a separate dye spot for the footsteps from the body's dye spot. Like say if I wanted to make a white stag, then by dyeing the body white, then the foliage footsteps that appears will be white as well.
---
I was behind Anet for a long time but this is really looking like a cash grab. I'm really disappointed that we are going to have to pay for something that should be free. 2 gear and 3 spec slots for multiple games modes (Fractals, PvE, WvW, Raids, etc) sound ridiculous.
---
Intentionally stripped system being released except to unlock more slots it’s paywalled. Convenience is “winning” as it saves time. Time is money. 
---
Is it directly pay to win power? No. But at what point will developers intentionally design their games with zero QoL only to introduce it later as “convenience?” Still not P2W?
---
Absolutely insane
---
They should have just left this on back burner and left arc templates up if they are going to charge for this

[ARENA NET] [Stephane Lo Presti.7258 posted on 2019-09-30 20:29:39](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/88848/templates-guild-chat-we-want-your-questions):
---
&gt; Hi everyone,
---
&gt;We have a Guild Chat preview tomorrow about the Templates feature. You can read more about it in this blog post: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/learn-all-about-build-and-equipment-templates/
---
&gt;If you have questions about the feature, drop them here and we'll answer as many as we can tomorrow.
---
&gt;Our developer guests are Amy Giannetti and Clayton Kisko!
---
No we don't. And everything pretty is already in the gemstore, you can't obtain 1 single mountskin ingame so that's that. This is a base function for a mmo with like 8 builds per class, not a paid feature.
---
I believe this is incorrect. Each character gets 3 free build template tabs and 2 free equipment template tabs. The other 3 (+ 3 more free for a limited time) was for the account bound build STORAGE, which can store builds from any class across your entire account. Think of it like a bank for build templates
---
If you have millions of players on an architecture that does not properly scale I wonder how you ever got that far.
---
I'm using 18 builds on 2 characters combined. This will be fun.
---
So what if they'll sell less in the future? All they've done since launch is add shit to sell. Outfits, glider skins, mount skins, black lion weapon sets, etc.
---
They had zero reason to monetize Templates, especially when GW1 did it and it didn't take 7 years only to try to monetize it.
---
?????????
---
Or you could, you know, save the builds on your computer and paste them in the free slots you get if you need to change them? For a grand total of no cost whatsoever.
---
Fact still remains that calling it P2W is stupid, since it is 100% convenience. ESPECIALLY since it is something that wasn't in the game in the first place. If it were and they removed it to re-release it like this you might have somewhat of a point (still not P2W though) but they didn't. This is new functionality added to the game.
---
# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!
---
Downgrade from guild wars 1 which would read the notepads for you. :(
---
Too late.
---
Almost there. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unknown_(NPC)
---
Just a few adjustments, and it's there.
---
I don't use Arc templates either. I just change my build manually.
---
I guess I'm just really out of touch LMAO
---
Which was the most difficult? 
---
Which is your favorite?
---
-WvW power scourge
---
-WvW celestial scourge
---
-Heal scourge
---
-Hybrid scourge
---
-Condi scourge
---
-Power Reaper
---
-Open World Minion Master Reaper
---
Fuck me I guess.
---
&gt;  kid
---
What cursor app/addon/program is that in the Weaver's video? I keep losing my cursor in all the visual crap on my screen in fractals &amp; raids.
---
Won’t work for equipment though
---
I'm no expert on sPvP but I would check out [metabattle's guides](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest) and maybe even check out [WP's pvp playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuEuQiXhSXllCvOU-TtRJLaBuLI7m1V8), he does a pretty good job of breaking down the builds and what he is doing.
---
You should go re-read the article, build templates are JUST your skills and traits.
---
You get two equipment templates for free. Those are the ones that let you switch your weapons/armor/trinkets from your bag...except you don't do them from your bag anymore, all the gear is stored in the template itself.
---
So there's nothing like arc, that switches gear from your character bags, anymore.
---
Ah yeah, sorry, forgot druid is a thing. 😅
---
ooh I honestly didn't think of that! Thanks for the idea!
---
\^ THIS
---
1 - what's the gem price for all slots.
---
2 - can you elaborate on how legendary items work. Can it use one equipment slot but be shared account wide and be used my multiple chars.  I.e I have 3 sets of leggy armour, one for each weight. Does that mean il have ample equipment slots as it can be shared. And does this mean we only have to make one set of leggy runes and sigils etc.
---
Ya'll had far too much faith in Anet if you expected these not to be monetized. That's why I had zero hype for them, I knew Anet would do something like this.
---
Bag slots cost 400 gems.
---
Hey guys. So yes. We have indeed being holding onto this feature, that we got since day one because its a fucking txt, in order to release it when we were feeling like the milk from the cow was running low. 
---
We are limiting the amount of builds per character because space time continuum its at risk. But fret not! We have discovered a natural stabilizer to counter it: paid gems. Also 9/10 asuran scientists recommend the ones paid with real money but we are obliged to say by law that even those bought with ingame gold are also valid.
---
Edit: almost forgot! You know that thing you have been using for years because we have kept radio silence regarding this topic for most of the time that we were fine with it as long as you were responsible for what it might happen? Yeah, its suddenly illegal.
---
We had it for free in GW1, I would rather have had that same system than this that only saves you inventory slots, which is pretty much just a few slots if you have legendary gear.
---
They need to make a profit yea but imo this isnt the way to do it. A feature that's been overdue for 7 years now gets implemented with a cap to how many builds you can store without paying. Shared bag slots I'm ok with being monetized, character bound build slots? I'm sorry but just no. Its bs and should be treated as such. Not that any of this outrage will matter anyway but it just feels like a slap in the face that an addon does this job for free yet now we will need to pay to use more than 3 builds on a character.
---
Because it took 1 guy a few months to do it.... free.    And this is a feature has been the #1 requested since launch.  Was also a free feature in GW1.
---
You get 3 build templates per character, plus 2 equipment templates per character, plus 3 (or 6 as an early adopter) build templates on your account.
---
Character and account build template storages are separate, like inventory and bank.
---
Anet could you increase the default Equipment Template tabs to at least 3 or 4?
---
Only 2 are way to low, i know you can buy more, but whats the point of expensive legendaries, if you can only make use of 2 different configurations, without paying up big time to get at least the minimum you need for frequent raid/fractal runs?
---
Paying and having limited space for a code copypaster (skills and traits) is kinda rough. My note pad is free.
---
&gt; Seriously in GW1 you could have an infinite amount of builds for FREE
---
Which you saved locally on your computer as text-files. Something that you can do here as well it would seem.
---
Will there also be build template UI skins that I can buy in the gemstore?
---
It's laughable, at the template's release we won't even have enough space in the account storage for one build per profession.
---
h@ such a cool idea ;)
---
&gt; Just wondering, what prevents us to store the chatcode for all my builds in a notepad and have endless templates? hehe
---
It's clunky, and chat codes only work for build templates, not equipment.
---
Ah, yeah, that makes much more sense.
---
But the game wont read from the text files. Not as they described it at least
---
Don't count on it. This seems like the kind of thing they would overlook
---
&gt; Really depends on the gem cost.
---
That is the clincher. The functionality of these sounds pretty well thought-out, and being able to hotkey builds sounds great. But I *have* to imagine they're going to charge a premium for slots.
---
Hello,
---
We've just updated our product page to reflect the reality, we've got Living World Story Content 
---
Thanks!
---
Exactly. These people are so entitled it’s insane. Players that want rewards all the time for playing the content they choose to, it’s absurd. In fact, they should put all rewards behind a BLC because GW2 is a subscription free game and the developers need an income source. They don’t work for free! Plus they could just swipe a credit card if they wanted to get gems. So easy too!
---
GW1 has a subscription?
---
 Power Support Chrono - Diviner/assassin/zerker mix with tank setups
---
Condi Support Chrono - Viper's. Specific Runes and Sigils needed, Trailblazers for tanking 
---
Minstrel Chrono- Minstrel/nomad mix 
---
Power DPS chrono- Assassin/zerker mix, more assassins needed if not taking Danger time 
---
Condi DPS Chrono- Sinister/Viper mix. Specific runes and sigils 
---
Condi Mirage - Viper's, Specific runes and sigil's 
---
Open World Builds- Self explanitory  
---
WvW roaming builds- Maurader/zerker/assassin mix. Specialised runes and sigils 
---
This is just a basic list of what i already have ready on arc dps. 2 slots is not enough.
---
Monetizing more build/equipment slots is the kind of shit that makes me want to quit a game. This is demoralizing and I hope you think differently about this choice ANet because I love your game.
---
yeah, the problem with making a game free to play and then locking all quality of life content behind pay walls is that inevitably everyone just experiences a worse version of your game.  
---
Contrast that with a subscription model with no in game shop.  The developer has everyone reason to make the game as good as possible for everyone.
---
YES. Why should I bother storing in a notepad? We **HAD** (have) a better system a decade ago.  
---
And why am I paying for it?
---
I currently roll through about 6 or so for my engineer alone. I have builds for my other classes too. 2 or even 6 is not nearly enough.
---
Are we able to right click a player to check their build also?
---
Yeah if the really push us with only 2 default equipment templates  that would suck big time and  would devalue legendaries by quite a lot...
---
If you ever do raids/fractals somewhat frequently you would need way more then just 2 and now you need to pay up for it
---
*(I think you changed the text a bit after I replied, but the gist is the same, so whatever)*
---
Don't shoot the messenger, but - because it's a sub-free free-to-play game with a two-in-one B2P expansion plus some DLCs for 7 years of content, and convenience has always been a way to offset monetization. Just like when you go buy a burger with real meat, and then pay another 80% of its cost for a cup of sugared water.
---
Probably just yolomouse
---
So equipment temp eats items till deleted and those items are only usable on that char - meaning item sharing between chars is rip now since you'd have to delete the template to get them back and make a new one over and over again.
---
I personally don't mind this as i swim in asc gear but i know some ppl will be hurt after losing arcdps temps :/
---
Yeah, they are not allowing Arc after the release of their paid version.
---
Three tabs...really? That's it? At least give us enough to make the thing useful.
---
Two elite specs per character, and I've got at least 2 builds each for most of those. Then there are builds for specific content or game modes. I know we don't have prices yet, but I'm fairly sure it's going to be way more than I'd be willing to give them to cover all the tabs I would need. Especially when I can just keep using trait/skill tab screenshots organized in OneNote for free.
---
I paid for the game. I paid for the character slots. I paid for the inventory slots. I paid for the elite specs. Do I really need to be charged for the quality of life feature needed to effectively use all of that stuff? The QoL feature that should have been in the game 7 years ago.
---
edit: I guess I can just slap the chat code into my OneNote stuff now to make that even more convenient. So thanks Anet for making your own monetization somewhat pointless.
---
Is anyone else deeply disappointed and also disgusted by this? I currently have access to unlimited build templates with a third party addon that has no additional cost. This is a basic feature of most mmos, and they're severely limiting the number of slots you have just so they can make you pay for them. It doesn't sit right with me at all. I don't think this is remotely okay to do with such a critical feature.
---
1. What the maximum number of templates you can buy.
---
2. Are these account or character unlocks (see bag slot unlocks)
---
It's what I expected.
---
Not what I hoped for, but exactly what I expected.
---
I never understood why fellow players (not enemies) messmer clones and Necro/ranger pet even have priortiy and they do even over the player who own is. If you place a pile of players together. And they spawn their pets and if you try to click the player it self you will click the clones/pets more so then you click the person owning it. When this happen i always ask my self why the hell do they have priority??? In what situation ever will i be interested in the rangers/necros pets or clones? If they are my own sure then i am, but if they are not mine why should i care?
---
Not to mention you are in a area with a boss. And there are many other enemies there such as veterans and/or elite. In my head priority should go always tab Legendary - Champion - Elite - Veteran - any other mob. But this never happens. Instead you get a veteran in another area of the map not pulled or aggroed even though you have two champs and a elite hitting you just next to you. 
---
Or in WvW you get hit by a enemy in my opinion your tab target should be the one that hits you and cause aggro on you. But instead you get the npc inside of the keep when you are outside or some ambient up the hill and some necro pet. Like why?
---
Wow, this has not aged well.
---
Talk about a dick move. Btw, you might have helped up creating a build template design, even though we had been working on it and trashed it several times, but yours worked. He better get some type of compensation to be honest.
---
I would gladly pay for content.
---
Greed.  Duh.
---
Cool. Yes. Why couldn’t they implement that instead of this abomination? Money money money?
---
Eventually, everything will go down... gw2 on the other hand, is not something you measure by going up or down, it will work for longer that you would like to have it, i assume.
---
What stops you from joining the fun? If you think is it worth to invest your time in it, id say no game is worth of such an investment, but if you are ready to spend your free time on a game, why not this one, it fits perfectly and then some.
---
As I said in a reply to someone else, I do hope that's how it is, but from how I read it, it seemed to me like the character based ones were like quick reference slots that linked to a build in your account wide storage. So at the outset, you'd have three builds in there for quick reference, that any of your characters could swap to, but if you cleared out that account bound slot, any alts that referenced it with one of their character bound slots would now have an empty reference.
---
Again, I hope I'm wrong and you're right. That's just how I interpreted it.
---
Why are you monetizing a key feature of this game that you have purposely being holding back?
---
For real, I have no problem with the store. But this is crossing the line for me.
---
Hey, you can store your 6-piece of ascended armor in a template bag for the low low price of another set of ascended armor!
---
It will always be included now.
---
Because the devs need to eat. They have poured a ton of resources into developing the system, and i don't think its a selling point for new players so it has to be inherently monetized.
---
Should've known they'd try to monetize this when one thinks about it, this is ArenaNet after all.
---
But all their names aren't (Rytlock, Bonwor, Malice, Bangar, to name a few). Also, Legionnaire is French, not Latin. Latin had no silent final "e", which you'd know if you studied Latin...
---
To get gear inside a template, you have to delete the temp. So it is a choice between using a temp or sharing items.
---
&gt; That is, as long as the +1 is account wide --&gt; base 3 per character to 4 per character.
---
Uhm, as long as that "account-wide" is an option. Like, I have 20+ chars, but will only need more than 2/3 base slots on 1-2 of them. In my case, the extra fee for account-wideness would be mostly wasted.
---
Gemstore is tolerable for Cosmetics. But Major QoL improvements that were standard in the original game is where the line is crossed
---
If they start banning people for using arc templates after showing this sorry excuse of a gem-story fuckery, this game will indefintely die. Better cope than be in denial.
---
Does it fill up as you go forth?
---
What is up with the first screen shot I see 3 tabs and 4 named builds how does this work?  
---
Also where is woodenpotatoes 9h analysis (Yes I know this dropped a few hours ago)
---
Looks like an infusion icon.
---
When is the last time you saw anyone play Herald in pve outside of HK....Herald is wayyyyy worse
---
Anet will be making mad bank with this, that's for sure.
---
It's the same company that monetized sitting afterall
---
fast clears = around 80g not counting in the ascended drops and exotics  
---
not a bad way to get some weekly gold income and it just feels like chillin with yo friends for a few hrs
---
Is there any way a solution can be found for legendary armor? It would really make the armor an insane value for something like this!
---
Possibly a halloween infusion in development as thats likely the next content release.
---
&gt; Plus how did they help Delta?
---
IIRC a dev spent time discussing the parts that read and modify memory in the client.
---
&gt; people will still use it because they can store more options there for free.
---
Who are those "people"? A handful of vocal raiders? Good for them. I know I won't be using a 3rd-party tool just for that. And thousands of other people too.
---
If I were ANet, I'd just leave Delta's templates ignored to keep those people silent, and sell to everyone else. But the way they've been behaving recently, maybe that's not the right thing to do after all...
---
I think it should just be blue. Preferably dark blue.
---
I tried and it's nice but the dagger gives better damage and mobility. The air and earth skills dagger are just too good.
---
Regardless of prices if they only sell as bundles that is going to be annoying
---
Considering the fact that a character rename is 800gems I don't think there is anyway to guess at what the prices will be.
---
&gt;They have poured a ton of resources into developing the system
---
1. It's fucking templates, they don't need to "pour a ton of resources" into it unless they're truly that incompetent.
---
2. For the love of fucking GOD, "the devs need to eat"? Do they not eat from the money they've made for years out of adding almost everything into the gem store or lootboxes? All the outfits? Weapon skins? Gliders and Mounts? Did they make so little money from all that \[which they continue to do\] that they gotta monetize a system most other games offer for free and far less limiting?
---
i will be rather whelmed if its 3 for the modes.... if its PER.... i will be ecstatic
---
Yep, but don't worry, because the whale pod who've never touched an actual game-mode in their life are fine with it because 'cOmPaNiEs nEeD tO mAkE mOnEy'
---
When you consider GW1 had unlimited build storage from day 1, it's a kick in the balls.
---
I'm fine with build slot monetisation. I'm fine with equipment slot monetisation (though 2 default is a bit low). It's the monetisation of build storage that is shit. That was free on launch day with GW1, and now 7 years after GW2 is launched we get it but limited to 6, with the rest probably monetised to the high heavens and back.
---
Having 2 for a character, giving me an option for a condi and a power build per character... i cna't really complain. Would have loved 3 to be honest but i'll get over it.
---
Well, don't use it then.  You can always just spend time switching stuff around manually rather than spending money for a QoL improvement. 
---
Would you rather they charge $10 per month?  Their business model is the gem store.  You don't need this to play.
---
They do have to make money and their devs aren't going to work for free.
---
Only the account-bound storage ("template bank") has been mentioned as a bulk purchase so far. My guess would be because they're just cheap (because kinda pointless).
---
Yep, basicaly that, to give you full lost of guaranteed things. It would be Story continuation, new map/update to previous map, skins, achievments, strike missions (mini raids), and then from time to time new fractal, new raid, and occasisionaly some big features like a new mount, elite specs, build templates which were getting next month and everyone is butthurt about monetization, etc etc. Im personaly really happy and excited about the future.
---
or legendary upgrades?
---
Zero, should have been in the game from the git go. Some of the profits should go to Delta...
---
&gt;Looking at the salty reactions
---
They're trying to sell more templates when almost every game \[including GW1\] has given them for free, with less limits and you think they're salty?
---
I don't know about a dev actually helping in those things and to what extent so i'll leave that at the sides.
---
But how does Anet their template have any beneficial options over Delta's other than the equipment storage? It literally comes down to a lesser function of the current templates that looks nicer because it's integrated into the game's own UI.
---
LMFAO charging gems for BOTH equipment AND build templates???  What a complete and utter joke
---
Imagine charging money for a system that's been free and unlimited for years. This seems to be another targeted hit to raiders/hardcore players who have multiple gear sets and/or legendary armour. I have about 12 different builds just for my elementalist (some are actual builds, others more meme builds for fun) and now you're telling me i have to give anet money to be able to swap my build quickly? Fuck that, this is the final nail in the coffin. I'm off to go play warframe.
---
I think it's the [standard porn meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/piper-perri-surrounded), could be my dirty mind though.  
---
Edit: It's not Brazzers apparently :)
---
Not all wiki mods have mod rights at discord. You want to know who is who, check the names, it's not that hard. Afaik there was a discord mod post stickied for a while, denouncing the situation.
---
Again, and for the last time: I moved along. Consider me done for the topic, I don't care anymore and I don't want to waste time with this. You're free to think whatever you want, I'm not here to tell you A or B, and I win nothing from this discussion.
---
&gt;not allowing build templates to be stored locally with no limitations like they are in GuildWars 1?
---
I consider storing the templates online in my account an upgrade over GW1's local files. Back in the day I didn't keep backups of my system, so now when I log back into GW1 once or twice a year I'm left without any templates. Completely preventable on my part if I had known and cared about it as a kid but still a bad experience.
---
Unless you mean a system that allows both. In that case, I assume it's a combination of "this will undermine our monetization of the online templates", of the system getting more complicated with two sources of templates, and of what I've personally experienced when I work on a project: I work a lot on a project while I'm building it up. Once it's in a working state, I still have lots of ideas about what I could improve but I never do because it's already useable and I don't care enough anymore.
---
Pretty much this. If you would have the default amount for free but only had to pay 2000 gems to have an unlimited (read: maybe 32 or 64), that would be a lot better. The fact you would have to buy per character is just horrible. I also hate how extra bags work and only keep the base 5 on 16 of 19 characters... i won't be buying any character-limited upgrades.
---
Thus having options in this case is superior. (Although unlikely, given the record.)
---
If you’re super casual you’re fine, but most veterans are leaving or have left the game.
---
Imagine acting like a spiteful child as a large game studio.
---
This is more funny if you look at his username.
---
You better say farewell to ARCDPS templates. It is gonna be gone.
---
Already written my eulogy
---
Fron personal experience I really hope you need to atleast be lvl 80 before you can access them because templates can teach pretty bad lessons about updating your build to those unfamiliar with the MMO genre.
---
Poor anet, can't post anything without leaking stuff. Give them a break.
---
You actually have a point right there, which is a problem the gods aren’t good or evil they just don’t care about us but the gods want humans to warship them 
---
 So why don’t we create you new gods maybe the pact commander/ at the end of the story there is an elder dragon and her friend the god of tyria  
---
Both of them created a group that protect tyria while the dragon and the human travel to new and mysterious realms. ( they come back to tyria every 80-100 years to check and there’s a device to send an help message to them while they are in a different realm)
---
My main player is human, I’m not saying that the god should be a human, it can be any race 
---
Just thought about it now lol
---
Corners are no longer free, please submit your crying fee in the nearest gem store access point.
---
Thanks for your purchase!
---
He hasn't stopped updating them. The code for build templates is just entirely contained within the regular d3d9 file of Arc itself, and gets updated regularly when they stop working. The d3d9_build_templates file is literally just a key that enables the window and keybind. That's why the templates file hardly ever gets updated, because there's almost nothing in there.
---
Source: Delta himself in his Arc channel in the EliteInsights discord.
---
It was better... until your HDD corrupted few blocks and all your few hundreds builds stopped existing.
---
It would be great if there were some way to link build and equipment templates together to equip all at once. If you don't have 1:1 associations between the two, trying to remember that e.g. build templates 1-5 are associated with equipment template 1, 6 is associated with 2, and 7-8 are associated with 3 could be frustrating.
---
And all of the fractal weapons. And the skins from 99CM, and the infusions from 100CM
---
Are they? I thought those were also character-specific.
---
&gt; For a limited time after release, you’ll be able to pick up a free pack in the Gem Store for a total of six free Build Storage Spaces.
---
In case you missed it, you can get 6 after launch for a limited time.
---
This will save me so much space on my scourge
---
How nice of you to believe the developers are the ones getting the money out of this.
---
One of the biggest things they hyped at the conference... and it's gated behind gemstore.
---
Next year, their next conference: advertising LOOT BOXES
---
Everytime someone posted a thread that they want build templates several people said they should monetize it and it was always upvoted. I know you have a hate-boner for this game but come on.
---
&gt; "If you don't like a decision of your country, leave"
---
My life summarized in a sentence. Venezuela says hi, bitch.
---
Also. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/92s8m1/psa_arcdps_build_template_seems_to_have_eaten_2/)
---
Exactly. But you have all those elite guys who have like a template per raid boss for some minimal gain, of course they're all here to explain why 2 isn't enough for them (and they're right) but they get all the upvotes while ppl who think it's enough get downvotes ... not because they are a majority but because avg reddittor wants to emphasize negativity when it's possible to do so instead of rejoicing for what we get.
---
If people are mad that they "only" get 6 free account build templates, 3 free build templates per character AND 2 free gear templates per character, then they should check out any other MMO where you at most get one build template per character only. (inb4 BUT GW1!!!)
---
&gt; You forget the fact many other games had this since before GW2, for free, including GW1.
---
GW1 never had equipment templates outside of PvP (because that mode wasn't actually using equipment). Try again.
---
dito, and im also here since prophecies :(
---
I actually feel punished for gearing my character in full legendary now. All that work over the years completely and utterly wasted because its functionality is now all hidden behind a pay wall. Fucking insane. Like this is a HUGE fuck you to the most dedicated players and I’m livid. 
---
If I had known we were going to just get “ascended bag slots” I would have just crafted fucking ascended armor at an insanely cheaper price point
---
A big issue for me. I hope they find a way to fix this.
---
Yikes y'all even found a way to monetize this.
---
Anet Bootlickers already downvoting lol.
---
You know it’s going to be 800
---
Well they still have 7 years to deliver in you timeframe
---
&gt; It's fucking templates, they don't need to "pour a ton of resources" into it unless they're truly that incompetent.
---
They very well might be. All i can say is that they have spent many years implementing it. And that work isn't free.
---
&gt;For the love of fucking GOD, "the devs need to eat"? Do they not eat from the money they've made for years out of adding almost everything into the gem store or lootboxes? All the outfits? Weapon skins? Gliders and Mounts? Did they make so little money from all that [which they continue to do] that they gotta monetize a system most other games offer for free and far less limiting?
---
They are a company, not a charity. Their sole duty is to provide value for their shareholders. Monetizing this system does that. Not monetizing it, essentially wastes time on developing a feature that has no marketability and no inherent value generation. Basically people aren't gonna start playing Gw2 because it has templates. So if it doesn't generate new interest in the product it needs to pay for itself. It does this by locking extra convenience behind a paywall.
---
They didn't develop this feature for fun. It has to provide value for the company somehow.
---
Well, for me it is good news. I will soley benefit from this but I am not using ArcTemplates. For everyone who is using it it will be a sad day. But on the other hand noone who plays the game for longer should have expected that the feature goes live without the usal limitations all account features share in guild wars 2.
---
Um how much would I pay per character build slot for something that was free in gw1? Nothing. 
---
However let’s see if there’s reasonable solutions. 
---
Will character build slots be in multiple packs?
---
Will there be an unlimited character build slot account wide?
---
Will there be an unlimited storage build tab in gemstore?
---
If there is an unlimited build character tab account wide for 400-800 gems? I’ll be happy to pay. If it’s per character build? Nothing.
---
I already have a Reaper and a Scourge juwt to make swapping between the two specs easier. And the Scourge already had almost a full set of legendary armour when Imade the Reaper.
---
Yeah I'm still working on completing my first set of legendary gear so I'm a few steps behind getting a single toon with all setups. I'm just happy I will be able to quickly swap between my Alacrigade and Power Herald setup in WvW now, as the squad grows or shrinks... Likewise between my quickbrand and power DH in PvE. For someone like me with 2 toons per class these numbers will be fine. I'll probably dedicate each toon to a damage type now (power or Condi) instead of 1 per elite spec.
---
I'm looking forward to condensing my mains down, and then sinking a ton of time into farming niche trinkets for niche builds, being able to save a more trolly plaguedoctor build for solo roaming without compromising my main zerg build will be worth it.
---
(Though theres a good chance that I will lose track of where the hell I have my &lt;stat type&gt; armor &amp; trinkets even more than I already lose track of everything)
---
Honestly a bit of both.
---
I actually tried blurring the transition so it wouldn't be a hard cut either haha. But the way I see it is the logo for IBS (wow that acronym) is half purple and half blue already. Just applied the same logic here.
---
so let me get this straight. i can pay for build template slots so i don't have to copy and past them from out of game? why would i do that build templates offer nothing worth my money.
---
equipment templates are fine depending on price because you gave them armor slots seems like an ok value if it isnt stupidly priced. a bag slot better not be more worth buying than equipment template.
---
GW1 had unlimited storage for free, from day 1.
---
We now have 6 free from year 7.
---
It's pure greed. GW1 and GW2 have the same monetisation model, so it's not that which is different.
---
Too early for legendary accessory unless it is for PvP/WvW.
---
exchange rate for my country is pretty bad too, however i would be happy with paying for expansions on a yearly / bi yearly basis if they were actually any good, i wouldn't bother with another PoF. sadly they seem intent on milking the playerbase for all its worth through the gemstore while putting out the least amount of content possible.
---
It's bit weird they switched it for the current model from what we saw in All or Nothing. I think they should stick ¯\\\_༼ ି \~ ି ༽\_/¯  
---
But I agree it's super pretty. Like Barbie's wet dream, but pretty.
---
When a lot of this stuff is baseline and free in other games, it's worth it
---
I'm pretty pissed off. There's zero reason for them to monetize this, as though there aren't enough things on the gem store. GW1 had unlimited template saves.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/90htov/discussion_what_are_build_templates_worth_to_you/
---
Some folks on there are claiming to want to pay for it. Even going as far as putting a price on it. 
---
And of course, there are those saying it should be free. But my point stands. That was just one instance.
---
I'm not going to sift through hundreds of comment threads in other posts that are unrelated but yet the subject is still touched on. That's way too much work.
---
yes
---
&gt; All i can say is that they have spent many years implementing it. And that work isn't free.
---
And every game that does has it, for free and with less limits, did what exactly?
---
It's honestly just a tiny bit pathetic, just a tiny bit, to see people defending throwing a price tag on TEMPLATES.
---
We also see the daredevil in their picture being equiped with celestial trinkets but the stats that are shown in the pannel are actually full berserker.
---
Well I want it to be 100% of the Mirage's damage, if that's what 200% clone autos looks like then sure. Is there a problem?  It would still do inferior damage and not damage any other builds.
---
Before Arc you still had to manually do each one, right? Now you can at least get 3 one click away. And, who said you HAD to use REAL MONEY? Buy your shit with gold. That's how I get all of my gem store purchases. I've probably bought items with gold more times than I have with real money.
---
Fuck, just the other day I bought a mount adoption license after scoring the shoulders from the strike mission.
---
In my case, I only have up to two builds per character, on three characters out of 9. Don't think I ever needed more than two. 
---
It absolutely boggles my brain when people claim to have 13 builds on a single character. It really does.
---
Like, one for running between nodes? And another for raids, one for fractals, one for story instances, one for AFKing in DR, one for doing hearts, one for trolling in open world, another to dash while running, and one to stare at asura in Metrica Province? 
---
I know I'm being silly there, but still... just how many builds does a person need?
---
&gt; i loved gw since their first game because you could play so many builds instantly without lvling, this monetizes the core feature that i play this for.
---
Yeah, and that's also gw 1. Not 2. The amount of effort put into the original templates was minor  compared to this shit. Not to mention, gw 1's version only did it for skills and attributes. Really think about it for a second and compare the amount of data and shit that each one deals with.
---
Well now we know why they were very quiet about how build templates work back at icebrood announcement. This being paid on top of no expansion/instanced content would have murdered them.
---
&gt;GW1 never had equipment templates outside of PvP
---
"GW1 never had equipment templates except where it had them."
---
........Jesus Christ, some people's IQ are dropping way too fast.
---
If they sell a slot for $5 that goes to all characters now and future, then sure, I'll go for it.  That's fair.  If it's like bag slots and $5 per character, no.  fuck that.  Bag slots are already bullshit enough if you want to have a reasonably sized inventory on a character.
---
That was specifically for PvP.
---
They look really good!
---
I like the idea of switching from power chrono to condi mirage with two clicks. This will also free up a lot of storage as most of my characters have exactly 2 armor sets.
---
The only thing I dislike is the limitation for accountwide build storage.

I get limiting build templates to three you can easily access and switch with one click and see why you would pay for more.
---
But the build storage will literally just store a simple code. Something we of course could easily do ourselves with a text file.
---
So I don't understand why we should have to pay for the storage of those codes. They should be free.
---
Store them locally like you did im gw1 if you want to save the server space but don't make us pay them.
---
I hope they change their stance on the storage as I LOVE everything else I'm seeing here.
---
But honestly I don't think they will change it at all.
---
i hope not, because... well, fk rangers
---
Careful buddy you're gunna get downvoted by Anet's army of bootlickers.
---
Looks like im gunna get downvoted too, feelsgood.
---
Plus 3 more free ones per character.
---
I can understand needing to get paid for the time and effort of the feature that was heavily requested, but we should not get nickle and dimed for it. The free amount is fine, but we should be able to pay to have an unlimited amount of each (read: maybe 32 or 64) for a SET amount of gems (for example 2000 gems gives you the max from the get-go). Paying 100 gems (or more) for 1 slot PER character is just plain stupid and a pain in the arse.
---
You're pathetic to have such strong feelings on me not wanting to spend money on a lackluster solution for equipment templates.
---
Brilliant play by Anet, they catering to the "completionists" that will try to deck out every character with full builds and gear for every gamemode, even if they dont play each one of them.
---
Isn’t GW2 free to play now though? :p
---
Ugly af
---
I mean. This game has monetized key features like character slots, item slots, and character customization since the beginning.
---
That's the only (non-CM) boss I've never cleared. Wayyy too much going on for your average pug.
---
Yea I understand paying for more than three to switch on the go.
---
But paying to store them at all? That's pretty shitty.
---
Nope, the mob mentality took over this sub years ago. Anything positive said about Anet will go straight to the gutter with downvotes.
---
this is how i feel, why not just make build templates free and we will pay for equipment tabs. paying so i dont have to use notepad? NTY i will bypass your shitty design all day.
---
Can't wait to see them dodge every big question and make excuses as to why they're trying to monetize a feature games have default for years.
---
It says the links works externally too, so you can share them on websites and such, so we can just grab the latest code from metabattle/SC website and call it a day.
---
Why on earth would you be so mean? Not very good at art yourself I’m guessing?
---
Nice work on 15.2! Yeah, I'd love to see a sub-15 on this course.  
---
Something did seem off to me about the patterns in my attempts, I thought I was going crazy.
---
only important for tryhards
---
as you know, arenanet hates tryhards.
---
&gt;Build Templates are a QoL/convenience feature
---
Build Templates have been a launch feature on many games before and after GW2 \[with even GW1 having them, PvP only or not\].
---
It is NOT something you try to monetize. This is just as stupid as Riot Games and their ridiculous Eternals system. Plus, don't forget we had this feature through 3rd party, for free, and even THAT was less limiting than this official one.
---
It’s a free game, this is an optional component of play. Please shut up.
---
I’m happy to pay for the feature for the free game. You just enjoy complaining.
---
Thats a terrible game design choice to frontload one single trait to such a ridiculous degree. The highest damage modifier is holosmith with near 100 heat at 31.5 and it barely has access to that for than a couple of seconds before overheating or exiting forge. Your idea is to just put something much higher than that on clone auto attacks.
---
7.
---
What phrasing in the post indicated that connection?
---
&gt; time of EA monetisation
---
Come on you know that's not fair 😂
---
**EA** would have you pay for all basic unlocks + upgrades. And real money only! Not gems!
---
Mmm sure, aside from my opinion on rewards - point is, raids are not casual friendly in the slightest. And, personally, I think there should be an alternative way to obtain the rewards that are currently in raids. Thus far Ive found nearly every gamemode (pvp, wvw, dungeons, fractals, openworld of course) is or can be casual friendly, EXCEPT raids. Im not saying raids should be fundamentally changed to accommodate casual players, but that its rather upsetting to be more-or-less locked out of not only the "story" of the content, but its rewards as well. Unless you have gold lol
---
“Pure greed” from the F2P game. Yeah.
---
🙄
---
Yeah it's 1 per job, so basically 1 if you only use one job in the game. So in GW2 you get 3 for free, 1 for each of your specializations. (and since most don't are about core specs, 1 for a future specialization). The game also have a monthly subscription fee unlike GW2, go check some B2P games like ESO or BDO instead. You really think that they wouldn't monetize such a feature like this when you already have to pay for extra bag slots, bank slots and account shared slots?
---
how hard is it to learn your rotation and play your role at the bare minimum that you're expected to?
---
not a lot, because it's guild wars 2 - and that's all you're required to do.
---
They have spilled the beans multiple times about how idea greenlighting works in their company. "Can we monetize it?" If yes - you get to work on your idea. If no - you can fuck right off. We can't even have such a basic in-game need as builds without it being monetized. But of course they would, they need to somehow justify paying developers a few years worth of salaries that went into the development of this system. System, that should by no means take longer than a month to develop for any sensible programmer, even including time to familiarize yourself with the codebase from scratch, time for designing and meetings and planning.
---
Welcome to game development in year 2019 A.D.: we've fucked everything up.
---
So, you say that comparing a pile of dog's crap to a load of  bull shit  would convince you to consume the former, wouldn't it? Because, darling, that is what you're trynna make ppl here to believe in. %)
---
I don’t have very strong feelings about this, but think it would be pretty great if an account bound upgrade to the template, storage, and equipment all in one was available in the 8th anniversary birthday gift and every subsequent one as well. 
---
Or, if it was given every odd year starting from the beginning of an account, with gifts being given retroactively, that would be pretty cool. (This version would be character bound)
---
I do think they should give some extra slots for players based on account age to make up for how long it took.
---
I can only speak for the trainings guild in which I am, but you have to be extremely shit to even be called out for something. And even that is not dps but mechanics.  You literally have to be borderline trolling and actively ignoring the commander. If you want to improve and are able to do that, there will always be a spot for you in a trainings guild.
---
And yes there are people who don't focus, don't care and don't put any effort into getting better. Raids are not the content for that kind of people, and that is fine.
---
My hope is 400 gems for 3 account build storage slots, 400 gems for 3 character build templates, and 400 gems for one character equipment template.
---
It's hard to argue what is baseline so we can only compare to other MMOs. Based on your argument they could've made you pay to use waypoints. Say 10 gems per waypoint. You dont need it but its hell of a convenience. Else you can get on your raptor and run from pof to hot.
---
&gt; but to have any degree of success in bigtime raids for weekly clears and shit, you gotta give up the idea of having fun, because
---
Not because of *everyone else*, but because your idea of "having fun" will lead to a failure of the whole group. You are the problem, not others.
---

You're right and getting downvoted LUL
---
* **Build Template Slots**: Zero or very low. It's patently absurd to charge for more of these given that they're really just small text files. *IF* pasting them in from an external source is fast and easy, instead of having to go through layers of menus to replace one of your current templates, I'd give them a small pass, as it would be easy to keep a text document yourself and only use/buy slots for the convenience of keybound swapping. Even so, it would have to be a very small cost for me to even consider it. (Realistically, I expect this to be 100-200 gems like a bag slot, but I'd really only consider buying a few if it's maybe 10 per slot per character, or 100 for an account-wide +1)
---
* **Build Template Storage Slots**: I actually could not care less about these? They seem completely useless, and as such I don't care whether they're one gem or a million. No one loses any meaningful value if they're locked to three.
---
* **Equipment Template Slots**: Geez. This is a hard call. It's "free" inventory space... kinda. You get *up to* 19 slots, but only if there's *no* overlap between any of your builds. If you use legendary equipment it's *barely* any better than build templates as far as being little more than a string of text on your hard drive, but this time without the advantage of being able to copy and paste from a notepad. Realistically, these can't be any more than 400 gems each: At that point, it's cheaper to just *make an entirely new character* with 2 new slots for whatever builds you want. Given the theoretical inventory space savings of around what a bag slot holds,  I can't see them costing anything outside of 200-400 gems, but I'd be pleasantly surprised (and more likely to buy more than *maybe* a handful for my main) if they were even less.
---
Overall, build templates are so convenient and so prone to making a lot of them so you have one pre-built for every niche situation, I think they'd actually do better selling more of them at a lower price than having them be more costly to the point where you really want to avoid them if you can. It's a shame that their design of equipment templates as inventory stand-ins prevents that from being reasonable.
---
The equipment templates store your equipment outside your inventory so they're essentially extra inventory slots which most people would pay gems for.
---
Ok so story time: a few years ago the mmo game Secret World dropped its subscription system and so I decided to pick it up the game. But I am not familiar with the mechanisms of MMO since they only one that ever kept my interest is GW2 which doesnt have a lot of the traditional conventions.  
---
But anyway I start playing the game and at some point I notice a tab on my inventory that says Template. Now I had no idea what it was, but I did work on the DayZ wiki at the time where we worked with script templates which made me cery currious for this weird button. So I went in and saw a option that said save template followed by a bunch of saveslots. I pressed it and nothing happened except for a saveslot getting filled, like any saveslot does. Afterwards I forget about it and went on.  
---
10 minutes later I find a better ring for my toon and I tried to put it on, and was hit with a prompt which read: Warning, this action will make one pr more Build Templates unusable. And I, beign the idiot I was, didnt realise a build temple saved your build but instead thought: "Oh that must mean this rimg I currently have is an important piece of gear, better keep it!" So I went on my way, ignoring any new drops since it warns me that I break it if I do it, so better listnen and not do it. Up until I basicly hit a wall because my characters gear was shit and in tsw all your stats come only from gear. And shortly after I quited the game because I wasnt having fun getting curbstomed by every mob.  
---
And that was atleast my experience with templates at an too early lvl, and I heard similair stories from others I have talked with.
---
P.S. i also recomand this video about how some videogame semantics can frustrate people not familiar with em: https://youtu.be/ax7f3JZJHSw
---
Yes, ranger pets and revenant legends are included
---
Build templates is core of RPG game. Monetizing it in B2P game that was 11 years+ in development... Well, sorry but this one is big fuck off to No-Expansion Mike.
---
You're all just spoiled rotten as far as I can tell, probably mad now that the ArcDPS addon will probably remove their template system so you can't have endless templates for free. Maybe suck it up or just don't use them if you're crying so much over "only" getting this amount of slots for free, vote with your wallet right? Oh wait, not like you were gonna pay anything anyways.
---
No, technically the full game content is ~$75 USD for new players. They just don't advertise it, which is kinda gross.
---
$30 for HoT+PoF  
---
$15 each for season 2, 3, 4
---
Technically at this point you can blow nearly 600g on each season, but good luck getting that as a new player when your cash is spent gearing up so that you can play the more lucrative modes.
---
The problem with GW2 has always been project management.  The artists and developers in the GW2 are extremely talented but the project managers running the show are not.  Until ANet improve/replace their project managers, the future does not look bright for GW2.  
---
The Ice Brood Saga is really a “make or break” moment for GW2.  From a marketing perspective, they need to sell the message that “the future is strong for GW2”.  From a project management perspective, they need to deliver software updates that 100% prove “the future is strong for GW2”.  As far as I am aware, they’ve yet to achieve that with their marketing event and the Ice Brood prologue.  Their next opportunity to achieve this is Episode 1.  
---
My advice to ANet would be to not hold anything back for Episode 1.  Bring your “A Game” and “break the rules”.  From my personal experience success is never guaranteed in software development.  To deliver a successful “major software update”, you absolutely need to go the extra mile.
---
Based on the post, I read that Build Templates are character-bound, infinite, and do not need to be purchased.
---
Build Storage appears to be different, in that it is account-bound and can be shared across characters or linked in chat. Slots for builds kept in storage are limited and must be purchased.
---
&gt; Would you rather they charge $10 per month? 
---
Yes.
---
1. This game isn't "free to play" entirely. Expansions *must* be purchased. Stop using free to play as a crutch when the vast majority of this game is behind expansion purchases.
---
2. This game wasn't "free to play" when I bought it pre-release. Or when I bought Heart of Thorns. Or when I bought Path of Fire. 
---
3. This game was sold to me on the basis of having huge numbers of builds and offering a huge range of choices for my characters. Funny that a game that used this as a *selling point* - selling point, because it is still a *purchasable game*, which means they are still moving units and making money that way - failed to have a build template system for such a core part of the game. Funnier still that when they finally do create a build template system for their game that they *sold on the basis of having so many builds to choose from*, they paywall the entire thing.
---
Yes, I would rather they charge me a sub fee if it meant they would make content on time and not paywall basic functionality in this way, especially basic functionality that is related to the core aspect of their game. You think I'm allergic to a sub fee or something?
---
There's a reason I play FFXIV more than I play this game, and there's a reason I am more than happy to pay that game's sub fee every single month. Because that development team doesn't lock core functions of its game behind unnecessary paywall bollocks, seems to actually have an understanding on where it wants to take the game, and doesn't try to hide behind the excuse of being "free to play" while still *actively charging* for expansion content.
---
Im not blaming the others. Apologies if it came off that way. Im just saying that personally I dont find a majority of the builds necessary enjoyable. And, in my experience dabbling in raids, not using explicitly meta builds generally leads to being the first person to be kicked. Also, "having fun" in my mind doesnt include dealing with toxicity and elitism :p
---
As long as we don't have 2.x
---
I think the downside is that I get a set of equipment storage space per free slot per character, and that has a value beyond just the customization ability.
---
that's your self portrait stfu bitch
---
Greatsword is purely a get you in get you out weapon atm mostly for spellbreaker in wvw. Hundred blades can not even remotely carry the damage enough to beat afking from axe/axe. It's also worded  to the point its going to be tick based not "2 skills period". So  auto first tick of hundred blades, done.
---
How would you have so many? There aren't even that many possible useful  combinations between the standard ranger and the 2 elite specs. Are you like changing one trait per build lol
---
Nice reply, very thoughtful, thanks for posting it. I'm sure it sounded better in your head, at least I hope that's why you posted whatever that was.
---
&gt;other than the equipment storage?
---
Equipment is one of the biggest limiting factor in the build change. I can remember my traits / skills just fine, changing every equipment is the real factor that limits my will to play with different builds.
---
The lack of the ability to share account bound equipment leaves much to be desired from equipment templates.  The majority of the inconvenience of swapping builds is the equipment itself.  People that use legendary and ascended gear over multiple characters have no benefit from this product without having to make additional sets.
---
I am not going to pretend to know the logistics and difficulty of implementing features like this, but perhaps another approach other than using actual items as far as ascended and legendary gear for these templates should be considered.
---
Such as having legendary/ascended gear able to be consumed/salvaged/stored in exchange for enabling an unlock to be used on the template itself to equip gear onto characters across the account.
---
Armor for example, you unlock a set of heavy legendary armor you pretty much have all heavy armor in the game for all heavy class characters.  The inconvenience this product can add value by eliminating is having to move these items every time you wanted to use another character with it.
---
Instead of storing the actual heavy armor on one character, for one characters use.  Perhaps have a method that would take this out of a persons inventory in exchange for an unlock an option to select it on all applicable equipment templates that would serve the same function as the respective equipped item.
---
Just a thought,  I think you sell many more of these templates if they functioned this way.  Personally, these templates serve players like me that move gear to different characters no purpose in having as it does nothing to eliminate the inconvenience of gear sharing.  I would not invest in these in their current state.
---
Can we have templates for those?
---
Show me where they told us the pricing.
---
bag space is a baseline feature
---
more bag space is a paid feature
---
It's not a question, it's absolutely character only.
---
this comment didn't age well
---
I agree with that, 3 seems like the sweet spot
---
Soloing, raiding, wvw, or some combo
---
Only 2 slots is pretty limiting, especially for someone like my FB with a solo spec, wvw solo spec, wvw group spec, and a fractal spec.  At least 3 I could wrap my head around
---
And since these are chat codes, you can STILL make a text file of unlimited builds. 
---
Why you'd bother with the balance meta being so stale there is really only 2 or 3 viable options per class period is beyond me but whatever...
---
It took me a month or so of casual playing to finally get my Skyscape
---
Aren't you worried we might end up with toxic people that say "ping build or kick" or "run this exact build or kick" situations?
---
Plenty of other games have it. They probably have other revenue streams aswell.
---
My primary concern is that you don't understand why they did this, and seem to chalk it up to malice.
---
Yes anet is greedy, they are a company, their entire reason for existing is to make money. They don't give away shit for free. They don't make this game for you. They make it to make money. And they can't make enough money, thats not how capitalism works.
---
If you think the fact other games provide this for free is such an important feature, go play those games. Vote with your wallet.
---
This impotent rage every time they create a new monetization system is pathetic.
---
50 slots per character? wtf?
---
I'm just going to hop on the train and say build template slots being sold is stupid. I think there needs to be a limit ofc, but having the option to buy them right at the start clearly shows this is just another milking practice: the limit now is 6 but sure enough they'll go the way of bank tab expansions.
---
from previous comment:  
---
&gt;Equipment template slots don't deserve to be more than 400 gems since character slots are 800. I think it's fair to say that players still actively into this game can level up and unlock skills for a new toon in less than two hours (too many tomes/scrolls).
---
----
---
And idea I'd really like to discuss is to have an additional equipment template slot (or 2+!) that are unlockable via an achievement. iirc there's already achievements that reward items in the BLTP. 
---
How's about:  
---
* +1 template slot for entering Special Forces Training Area  
---
* +1 for equipping a piece of legendary weapon/armor  
---
* +1 for equipping a legendary trinket
---
Others?
---
I spent alot of money and have 70 characters. If I want 3 build and 3 equipment templates on each character, what do I need to buy.
---
This is literally my reason now too. Even a quick w4 gets you some nice gold and matts etc.
---
How?
---
You're not winning anything.
---
I seemed to me that you get a base tab, plus two extra tabs? the screenshot kind of shows this too, would love confirmation from u/Anet-PaulS
---
A ranger being welcomed in 5 man content for actually having a longbow? What is this trickery?
---
Meanwhile other MMOs have gear inspection and no issues with this rampant toxicity.  I swear the GW2 playerbase is a bunch of sheltered snowflakes
---
No they don't. Why do they tell these lies?
---
If you already use arcdps, couldn't you just keep using it and maintain fluidity?
---
too many edgy normies in this sub to appreciate how bad this meme is
---
&gt; how will they handle the necesity of new mayor content 
---
Another fledgling who doesn't understand what Living Story updates are.
---
Did you read the post? By default all characters start with 3 build and 2 gear templates, so you're missing 1 gear template per character.
---
Take us to dinner first.
---
Like I have at least 3 gear sets for every of 9 Professions for different builds. And additional Legendary Guard with big amount of Rune swaps. 
---
So to have basic QoL feature functional I would need to pay for 27-3 = 24 Build Template slots. And for 9 Gear Template slots. And god knows how many for actual utilization of legendary armor on 1 character.
---
Even at lowest possible price of 200 gems per slot it is like 80 USD+. Could not even try to justify it for game with 0 content.
---
That's what I'm afraid of too but a man can hope.
---
Literally saw this coming miles off. Smh
---
Why do we only get two slots for gear saving when arc provided infinite for free? At the very least we should have 6. Since that’s the average for people who use templates. 
---
It’s really a slap in the face to Raiders, WvWers and PvPers that have been asking for this for 2+ years. Gw1 and every other game provides it for free.
---
This probably took them tons of work and those workers want to get a paycheck at the end of the month, so the company decided to make some money off that work
---
Think of all those precious seconds you've lost!
---
;)
---
Can't wait to buy 15 different equipment slots just on my guardian alone to be able to continue raiding without the severe cancer caused by manually swapping full legendary gear. And then there's the other 6 classes I play. And WvW and PvP. Monitizing this seems like very sensible idea.
---
Jokes aside, you can't even deliver content worth mentioning for this game anymore and now you take away the convenience we've had for years by a great third party tool to make some quick cash on it? Fuck you, seriously. I'm done. You're no better than the complete asshats in charge at €A and Activi$ion.
---
Typical anet charging money for something we've had for more than a decade in gw1. Scummy
---
If we get 3 for wvw 3 for pve and 3 for pvp it will be ok for MOST people, of course the tryhards and raiders who have like 15 builds will struggle, but really most people need this.
---
Pve: open world, fractals dps, and a heal/boon spec.
---
Wvw: a zerg spec, a roamer (lol like this is a thing) spec, and a... well that's about it unless you are a commander and need like 14 builds to super min max a zerg mode.
---
And pvp same thing basically.
---
But if it's only 3 for all modes combined that will be a no bueno
---
Your post is super toxic and I'm probably a carebear, but I agree with you.
---
Gotcha thing is that you can only attach legendary items to multiple Gear Templates. So if you want to use the same ascended jewelry, etc on multiple Gear Templates you would most likely need duplicates, at least before confirmed otherwise.
---
It's hard to tell. 
---
Since PoF, ANET seems to have gotten greedier with gemstore decisions. However, I'm not sure great people like Mike Z put so much work in GW2 simply because they want to exploit people with loot boxes. There does seem to be genuine passion that goes into GW2.
---
My theory is that NCSoft constantly hovers over ANET, scrutinizing them. We see how hard they slammed ANET with the layoffs. That was a show of force: "You better make more money OR ELSE!"
---
... or it could just be execs at ANET being greedy.
---
Dunno.
---
Comments in this thread confirm one thing. Majority of the people here can't seem to stop bitching. Just not capable of it.
---
But do they save separate transmutes for the same armor ;)
---
Under the assumption that Anet would ever make them? Surely not. However, Delta’s version of templates has been around for ages now and they let you use the legendary functionality to the max, unlike anet’s version.  Anet’s version essentially punishes you for having wanted the best gear to free up your bag space/streamline your character in years past.  One of the reasons to get full legendary previously was to get rid of so much ascended gear space. Now anyone can do that just by buying templates. Oh, but wait, legendary gear users have to buy templates too. 
---
It’s really only a big fuck you to hardcore players anyway and anyone who mains only one character, so I don’t expect most casuals to be upset about this. but they don’t even make content for us more hardcore players anymore anyway so why should I care to buy these exactly?
---
Most of the "big questions" here are just inappropriate and phrased in a non-constructive way. If you asked me most of this in person, I'd just blow you off for being an asshole.
---
Why charge money for builds?
---
Gear storage/templates sure. But why builds? You're taking away arc templates and giving us less at a cost.
---
Do you know how GW1's build templates work? Can we get that in 2022?
---
And the absolutely worst thing is that we don't even get the content, where the need for the build templates manifests the most. What exactly am I going to fund by buying BT slots? Next 2h story episode? Fuck that.
---
I think how they've monetized the system is fine. This is a convenience feature. Respeccing Builds doesn't cost inventory slots, and they're essentially giving us free inventory slots with Equipment templates. With a bag-slot expansion upgrade, you can store a spec's equipment very comfortably in a 20-slot bag. This all just depends on the price of an equipment template upgrade vs a bag-slot upgrade.
---
It's honestly fine. What if the feature was locked behind a purchasable expansion? That'd be fine by me too. If this is crossing the line, don't use the feature, don't buy the upgrades. Some of us are happy to support the development of qol features.
---
I'd think that 600 gems is a good price. that's 200 per template slot, the same price as a LW episode!
---
I offer 1 gem for everything. After all this waiting for a feature I feel should have been there since day one, I feel that is fair.
---
You will literally be better off than you are right now without spending a single penny.
---
Are they not giving you free build template slots and free equipment template slots?
---
r/gw2: Content updates are so slow. This game is dying because content release cadences are months apart.
---
also r/gw2: why should we pay for additional qol features when we could be getting them for free?
---
Yeah, but it's more than one. :)
---
Ahem, let me introduce you to my friend *EA*
---
100 per slot
---
Of course the general pub scene is gonna be elitist *to some degree*. When people are pugging content, they're hoping for a reliable clear. People are generally really lax about things like dps being in 50th percentile or boon uptime being spotty. You'll run into a few people who are beyond extra in that regard but for the most part, so long as you're not messing up critical mechanics related (dropping poison on the group for slub, not running out time bombs on sab, etc). Those are the things which are critical to the success of the run and what they're assuming you have the knowledge of.
---
It's not going to be easy to get started, but it isn't easy for really anyone unless they're in a lucky position to be carried by friends trying to get them interested in raiding. Expecting to be on the same level of people who have been running this type of content for years or literally those specific instances for years is a bit silly. You have to put in the time to learn some basics for your build, rotation, and mechanics. Raid guides, videos, and training runs all help with that, but yes it's intimidating and hard to start.
---
Just like with fracs: You probably won't be ready to run with a 200 Ess group right away because they are relying on high boon uptime and high dps burst and if you are dead weight it is felt very quickly and hurts the overall run significantly because the expectation for 200 Ess is for psuedo-speedrun (not like world records but y'know) clear times. You'll have to spend some time learning how to improve first before you're ready for those reliable and fast groups.

Think that is kind of incorrect. For example thief in pve. There’s boon thief, boon thief tank, heal thief. Then there’s power deadeye, power daredevil.  
---
For ranger, there’s condi soulbeast, power soulbeast, Druid, Druid hankite. Also you can Druid tank on kc, xera. 
---
For guardian. There power dh, condi Firebrand. Power quickbrand, condi quickbrand. Healbrand. Healtank. 
---
For ele. Power weaver, condi weaver, power tempest, heal tempest (with magi), boon heal tempest (with harriers)
---
For mesmer. Mirage, power chrono, power boon, condi boon. Boon tank, condi boon tank 
---
For warrior. Condi berserker, Core power warrior for cc, power berserker, power spellbreaker
---
For rev. Condi rev, heal rev, diviner rev, power herald. 
---
Etc etc. As much as 2-3 seems like it’s the right amount. It’s very inaccurate for people who use different classes and builds for different reasons. Since meta has changed that mesmer isn’t number 1 anymore, diversity with raids and fractals have changed compositions drastically. Which leads to having different builds for different comps that are very different then it use to be. I would say per class you would need 4 just for pve. Since wvw is another different ball game, it would be nice for having pve, wvw, and pvp to have the amount limit added separately. 3 for each game mode is fine to start. But an ideal safe number for each would be 4.

Exactly

sounds like a hell of a slippery slope.

I have two questions:
---
What made you think that 2 slots would be close to an acceptable number for raiders/pvp players/experienced players in general, when that portion of the community usually has atleast 8 builds per character on arcDPS which has already existed for several years and it's free.
---
Is making a quick buck out of addicted whales worth further damaging the company's reputation in the eyes of long term fans of the guild wars franchise?
---
Thanks.
---
Build slots: 0 ideally, wouldn't pay more than 50 gems per 3 slots. 1 slot is worthless to me, I need 10 per character to play comfortably.
---
Account build slots: don't matter, they aren't unique per-profession, and hence are useless for players that play multiple classes
---
Equipment slots: 200 gems per slot is fine, since it essentially saves you bag slots. But they really should be free for gear slots with legendary items equipped. Legendary gear is already devalued by the existance of this feature, but to add insult to injury, they make swapping legendary gear stats much more limiting.
