"He got his wife"
---

---
Uhhhh, nnoo..? I'm the one who found the thing, why would I not, myself, come back to check the thread for it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And I mean, yeah, you sound pretty angry.
---
---
---
I see you comment to help new players out a lot, and I just have to say its really wonderful to see. I know so many people who have needed or wanted help as a low level and seeing you so active and ready to help on reddit is a breath of fresh air 🙂
---
You sent your GF this...? Even though it was a joke, I would apologize
---
There's some guild hall unlock that lets you have infinite flight as an orb I know that.
---
Only a small percentage of people I offer help to ever contact me, but I try.  I really enjoy playing with new players. The game is such a breath of fresh air in the genre, that it's fun to watch people see how it's laid out first hand.
---
The other side of the coin is that the game doesn't always explain itself well. Plenty of people expect a bog standard MMO and are confused when they get in, so it helps build the community as well.
---
See i agree with all of this, but i've had this same issue since 4.30pm. I wasted hours trying to fix this manually. I then stopped and went to play WoW. 
---
WoW is pretty shit right now, but it is still at bare minimum a 5/10 and with the ability to buy game time with gold, its no skin off my back. One game is working, one isn't.
---
Oh, its 1 AM btw and i just logged in to check - still broken.
---
And yeah, after manually trying to fix it for hours i stumbled upon posts from over 2 years ago, as well as ones from april and today, confirming that this is ArenaNets problem and only ArenaNet can fix it.
---
I basically have to wait for a developer to manually take the time out of his day to fix my account, again, manually.
---
Considering there are support threads open where people with stolen accounts wait *weeks* to get a response, i very much doubt im going to get the time of a programmer any time soon.
---
So maybe i'll check in tomorrow, or maybe i won't.
---
As i said in my ticket - the only thing i can do is play menu wars 2. So i spent the past 30 minutes selling an item to a guy. Fun.
---
I mean you are free to feel how you do, as am I. I'm not trying to have a discussion, I made a statement about how sad I was to read comments that I read every time anything like this comes up anywhere. Also, They don't MAKE games for me. At all, ever. I have to overcome, adapt, etc etc to even be at half the level of anyone else in any game. Yes that is my lot in life, and I accept it most days. But every time a game shows the slightest hint at making something easier (adding options or easy modes, or more ways to get something) people cry to the heavens that it cheapens their experience. I don't see anyone championing them to remove difficulty from Raids or Fractals for accessibility reasons. I have seen topics of adding an easy mode so more people can experience the stories though. And yeah, I would VERY much like that. I can do fractals all right, but raiding is too hard with one hand, even with my specially made mouse/hotkey set up.
---
I can very much feel and think that there should be games and space made for me to sit at the table too. So yeah, I have feelings when people act like a game making a change to make something easier and more accessible is a 'slippery slope.'
---
Yeah and the people who are having trouble with Skyscale Reflexes , are the people that could REALLY benefit from a Skyscale . Cause the control on it is SO much more pinpoint than a griffon.
---
Some people use ghostly infusions to have the best stats possible. They are preferable because their cost is equal to normal +9(agony)/+5(stat) infusions and they are tradable.
---
Yes full zerk, dont bother going marauder or valkyrie or knights all that will do is waste your gold and not make you a better player. Passive defences like high hp and toughness are good for bad players because they dont dodge at the right time and dont understand the monster/boss mechanics, so you may struggle at the beginning but it will teach you to be better in the long run.
---
Posting on reddit to contact customer support is not allowed. That's the reason op doesn't post details. He is talking generally about the topic.
---
I'll just copypaste what I put on the other thread:
---
&gt; Nope. 1 slot would not cut it. And we shouldn't even be just talking about "auras" as if they were just 1 thing. There's a lot of different kinds of effects, and some even composed of different effects.  
---
&gt; Many are fine when stacked, like those that colorize the character, others not so much. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; So they should have whole section for them in the wardrobe, have different types and categories, and allow stacking only SOME of them:
---
&gt; * Aura (max 3)
---
&gt;  * Effects come from within the character, mostly glows. 
---
&gt; * Ambience (max 1)
---
&gt;  * Effects that show particles and other effects floating around the character like nightfury or winter's embrace.
---
&gt;  * Can equip up to 3. 
---
&gt; * Colorize (max 3)
---
&gt;  * Just color change of the whole body
---
&gt;  * When more than one is equipped, the colors are mixed.
---
&gt;  * Right click an equipped colorize to choose how it should [blend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes) with the other colors.
---
&gt;  * The same effect can be equipped multiple times (e.g.: Stack 3 Polyluminescent Undulating Refractors, you get very dark)
---
&gt; * Trail (max 1):
---
&gt;  * Effects appear only when the character moves and leave a trail behind.
---
&gt;  * Right click an equipped trail to choose whether the trail should come from the back, the feet, or both.
---
&gt; * Shader (max 3)
---
&gt;  * Effects that add more complex visual changes, like becoming translucent (like omnomberry ghosts), or having an outline like Polysaturating Reverberating Infusions. 
---
&gt; * Foot falls (1 or 2)
---
&gt;  * Effects are left behind on the ground when walking where the character stepped.
---
&gt;  * When two are equipped, they alternate left and right, you'd be able to right click either and indicate which one goes on the right foot.
---
&gt;  * Unlocked mostly from legendaries. When at the same time as a legendary, it overrides the ones from the legendary.
---
&gt; * Arm effect (1 or 2)
---
&gt;  * They cause an arm to be surrounded by an effect when taking weapons out.
---
&gt;  * When one is equipped, you can right click it to get a menu with 3 options to choose to apply it to both arms or only left or right.
---
&gt;  * When two are equipped, the first one is assigned to the right automatically, and you can right click either to get a menu and select the only option to switch them.
---
&gt;  * Unlocked mostly from legendaries. 
---
&gt; * Unsheathe effect
---
&gt;  * Effects shows when taking weapons out.
---
&gt;  * Unlocked with legendaries for now.
---
&gt; * Skill replacer (max 1)
---
&gt;  * Replace skills effects. 
---
&gt; * Overhead effect (max 1)
---
&gt;  * Includes visuals that appear over the head or shoulders the selfless and selfish tonics, as well as the Ellen and Evon button effects. It would be possible to unlock some as PvP rewards from the map mechanic visuals, like the Svanir claw icon or the supply icon, but those would not work in PvP or WvW.
---
&gt; * Other (max 1)
---
&gt;  * All other effects
---
&gt;  * This also includes all the skins that are actually skills effects applied when equipping a 'skinless' item, like the karka head grab and the Bloodstone visage eye effect. 
---
&gt; Then we would have 9 slots, just **nine**, to put *any* of all these effects in any of those 9 slots, in order we want, provided we stay under the cap.  
---
&gt; Click a slot and to the left you'd see all your effects that can go there, with a filter at the top to show only certain types.  
---
&gt; When the limit of one type is reached, the rest of the same type get grayed like when items in Discovery or Mystic forge that can't be added to the current recipe.
---
&gt; When effects are equipped at the same time as effects in gear, they override those in gear that go past the cap.
---
&gt; ---
---
&gt; * Legendary gear would unlock their effects automatically.
---
&gt; * Gemstore effect unlockers and very rare effect drops would be ready to use.
---
&gt; *  Unlocked skins that are actually visual effects and not actually armor skins (nightfury, karka helmet, winter's presence, rime-rimmed rebreather's chill, bloodstone visage, etc) would be unlocked automatically, but the items and the wardrobe will no longer have the effects in these skins, they will instead be converted into "Invisible" helmet, breather and shoulder skins like the invisible slippers. 
---
&gt; * Unlocking visuals from upgrades and consumables would not be as cheap and simple as those. They would require jeweler 500 and crafting the actual unlocker.  The cheaper the item that gives the effect, the more expensive the final recipe will be:
---
&gt; For example, omnomberry ghosts are very cheap, so to get their effect as a permanent one, you'd need at least:
---
&gt; * 6 +9 Agony infusions
---
&gt; * 1000 Omnomberry Ghosts.
---
&gt; * 250 globs of Ectoplasm
---
&gt; * 4 Gifts of Souls   
---
&gt; And you'd get:  [Ghostly Visage](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/7/7d/Strawberry_Ghost_effect.jpg). Consuming this item would unlock the 3 effects that compose the ghostly effect from omnomberries:
---
&gt;      * Ghostly Green Colorize - Makes the character pale green  that also affects weapons and backs.
---
&gt;      * Ghostly Green Mist Aura - Creates a ghostly greenish aura. 
---
&gt;      * Ghostly Translucent Shader - Makes the character translucent, and almost transparent at the feet. Also affects backs and weapons.
---
&gt; Now, would this ever happen? Probably not.
---
&gt; But it is what *should* happen.
---
Always aim the highest you can. You may not reach that, but you'll probably still get pretty high in the process.
---
Agreed. It's a wonderful touch. Now if only Braham could be 1/100th as of useful Id be happy.
---
This is high effort trolling.
---
They have had time. 7 Years. At a certain point, the playerbase stops giving a company the benefit of the doubt and in frustration either withdraws their interest/support of the game, or petitions for some change. Both of which has happened in the PvP community at large.
---
No, the current EU player bases focus should be on playing the game. The only burden any player should have is paying for the game and keeping in line with ToS. As for proof? There is mountains of it, which is why Ben P is aware of it. It happens so often to so many PvPers, especially recently (one of which I know decayed out of Legend division because he could so often not queue for PvP due to this bug). Plus it has happened many times on stream to prominent PvP streamers, so much so that they had to find backup activities while being unable to PvP and it happened for hours at some stretches. These streams are where Anet Ben P made it known they were aware of the problem and are "working on it".
---
As for the NA and EU thing, I don't see the relevance to this post? Aside from "Well, it aint happening over here so, not my problem." Which, while correct, doesn't really matter in the context of this post?
---
Never used to go down with out my main man Olias. Infact if you had livia, olias and masters all specced appropriately, you could solo a lot of stuff in gw 1
---
Thanks! Giving it a try now, liking it so far! :)
---
My solution: Slider in graphics settings to lower intensity of the effects. So at highest it would be what it is now, but at a slight notch away from lowest you have like, one piece of confetti popping out every 10 seconds, or a very faint blue glow. Could also have ones on the character tab for YOUR characters only, for example, if you're fine with being swarmed by bees, but only want a slight glow, then you do you.
---
The Red Wings calendar &amp; banner are backwards too.
---
I just saw your update, and that's utterly disconcerting regarding Windows 10.
---
We don't need to limit aura stacking, but we definitely need auras in the wardrobe.
---
It really is something else. I myself didn't think too much of it until I was doing a random battle on Dragonfall. Was just me and a couple other people having a fairly okay time when all of a sudden here comes Aurene. Lands on the battlefield and shoots some breath at the boss. I expected her to blast him and fly away, but nope... She actually stayed and continued to battle with us. She kept breathing fire at the boss until we finished him off. It honestly made me feel a little better having her there helping us lol Overall a really nice touch indeed from the anet team :)
---
Amazing?
---
They should totally release a whole new original skin for ascended armor that can be upgraded to legendary armor with the same skin after 1.5 years of CMs
---
That is actually a very impressive stack effect! Good work! It is Ember and the green right?
---
I wasn't aware it was *that* bad over in EU.  We see scattered posts every now and then, but there hasn't really been a mega-thread or anything that sums things up.  If I had to deal with that for more than 6 months I'd probably pack my bags.  Y'all are tenacious.  The only reason I brought up NA is because it seems like the severity of the issue is significantly more profound on EU which is how/why my initial points and arguments were so out of touch with the issue.
---
Also, decrease skyscale size in flight as an option.   I'm starting to get flashbacks to old games where people had giant mounts taking half the screen with giant flapping wings... it's not that bad but can still be obnoxious
---
Honestly I can't imagine many people would complain that others can turn down their effects, not like you could ever tell if someone did anyway
---
At this very moment, I'd be happy with this:
---
* Replace the illustrious skins in the ascended armors from the Bling vendor with a new set of Fractal Armor skins. 
---
 * Add a way to upgrade them to a Gold Fractal Armor version. 
---
 * It would be possible to upgrade the gold version to legendary status like how you can upgrade WvW and PvP ascended armors.
---
* Replace the cobalt skins in Ascended Weapons from the Bling vendor with Fractal Weapon skins.
---
 * Add recipes to upgrade ascended fractal weapons to legendary status, using a lot of golden relics and CM reward tokens in the process. The legendary version of fractal weapons will simply use the golden skin. Their purpose is stat switching, not bling, anyways. 
---
* Create recipes to upgrade the ascended fractal trinkets to legendary. They will not have visual effects, this would be for utility.
---
* Create a second legendary back, a golden version of  Ad Infinitum.
---
 * Once there's 25 fractal levels, each will get a CM. Crafting this back would require doing CM for each of them at least once, and some several times to gather extra stuff unstable cosmic essences.
---
 * It would also require golden fractal relics.
---
 * Needless to say, the name for this golden back can **only** be "Ultra" (Beyond). 
---
* When both a fractal and golden fractal versions of a particular weapon, armor piece or both backs are unlocked, the Bling vendor will offer for purchase a Shifting Fractal version that will switch to Gold Fractal skins during the day and normal Fractal during the night. 
---
 * These will be just skins, not gear, and only cost karma. But A LOT of karma.
---
 * Buying these will require having completed all 100 fractal levels, but they will be available one by one without having to complete any collections. So if you unlock the Fractal Sword and the Gold Fractal Sword, you can buy the Shifting Fractal Sword, regardless of how many other skins you unlocked. 
---
 * The name of shifting fractal back will of course be "Ad Infinitum Et Ultra!". Passing the opportunity to have the combination of both mean "To Infinity and Beyond" would be unforgivable. 
---
* To compensate for all the new uses of gold fractal relics, Gold fractal weapon drops would be slightly less rare.
---
Wow, that's new for me.. make me wish i could invite her to party haha
---
70 core tyria world completions?
---
Fractal console. You can also get the same effect from doing the ball bounce activity in the Mistlock sanctuary
---
Yee, currently working on all the other maps
---
there should be a "hide auras" setting. just enable it to make the game look better and increase your fps with no downside at all.
---
Yup
---
If you can honestly get that much mileage out of world completion, more power to you. I've only had the willpower to do it four times so far.
---
&gt;	Honestly I can’t imagine many people would complain
---
New to the subreddit, eh?
---
I know if you set model limit/quality to the lowest setting everyone will look like a generic armor class. But I agree with you - personally I think it should be “all-or-nothing”
---
I finished my fractal titles not too long ago.  Frankly, the best reward is time spent away from Fractals.  I've been playing Mass Effect 2 and Path of Exile's new league, Legion.  I can sympathize with wanting more rewards, but one of the best rewards I've had as of late is simply being away from terrible pug players.  I tend to just skip the super difficult instabilities these days.
---
Lol no and I know what you mean, but like overall besides reddit I don't think too many people would be whining about it
---
Then introduce a legendary infusion that disables all other users' settings
---
This can bbe fixed by joining party of someone else and he triggers new queue. It will ask you to accept, and then you are normally queued and can cancel it and it is fixed. 
---
Also, expecting many players to play PvP in the pause between seasons, and within meta rush event, is quite ridiculous.
---
Thanks, started the griffon collection, I believe I have? Lol.
---
PvP season starts at 11th, now nobody plays PvP during the pause between seasons (it is mere 2 weeks pause though) and actual PvE event. Enjoy your dead game that WoW is, though :)
---
Great videos Walrus but mostly I just wanted to thank you for introducing me to this [absolute masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOsck7jYUsE)
---
Dry Top, some boss metas (only one map for some), less popular metas, activities, hero points, mini dungeons,
---
Most things in the game require someone to organize things ahead of time to get anything done, which runs contrary to the ad hoc design the game was built on.
---
I am utterly baffled why anyone thinks that they will monetise build templates.
---
If dry top isn't being done any more, how do I keep getting in tier 4 servers? The guild Sands runs it regularly for T6 btw. Which boss metas? Which activities can't you do? 
---
Yes the game has evolved, in part due to people asking it to. You may not like that evolution but some people wanted and asked for more organized content, because in MMOs that's important. 
---
The temples in Orr were supposed to be that. It's part of what some players want...including me.  Doesn't mean you need huge organization or prep. I don't prep hardly anything but I get pretty much everything done. Even Serpent's Ire was nerfed enough to pug now.
---
"Jesters and clowns go into battle, too, right? There should be something fitting for them."
---
Something like that, probably.
---
Because every other feature is monetized?
---
I think we’ll get maybe 2-3 save templates for every character, and if you want more, you can turn to the gem store...  I would love to be wrong, but I just see it as another QoL feature waiting for the gem store like bag slots/inventory slots/material store expansion/shared inventory slots/hero slots/name changes/server xfers/etc...
---
What about the festival makes people buy quartz? I.e. should I be stocking on quartz too?
---
Some more unique skins, and unique ascended stuff would be nice.
---
Like you I do them daily and it has gotten to the point I have one of every class with 2-3 sets of armor and weapons (minus my guard he has legendary stuff).
---
At this point aside from the gold there doesn't really feel like there is any reason to do them.
---
Bifrost is known to do the same. Unfortunately nothing you can really do about it.
---
That I could get behind.
---
Gives something else long term to save up for and unlock.
---
unique armor set that can be upgraded to legendary would be nice.
---
Also would be nice if we could just buy the cosmetic infusions, they would need to cost allot but them being random only sucks.
---
I certainly wouldn't of wasted the time getting Koda's on my charr... the effect isn't nearly as prominent as it is on other races, or, paradoxically enough, even as prominent as the Koda's effect you get by standing near the Koda firepits- even *on the same charr.*
---
I mean... it's clearly not true that every feature is monetised.
---
It would be a monumentally bad PR move on their part to assist in the creation of a free feature only to shut it down in order to charge for it later. Especially given that the feature has always felt like one that was missing for no reason (as it was in GW1). 
---
I would see this much more like the wardrobe system - a core QoL feature. Limiting the number of slots you can save builds in would feel so bad as to almost make it worthless.
---
Ultimately as this is something that is capable of being provided for free, to charge for a worse version would just be a dick move. And at the end of the day that's not really Anet's style.
---
Thank you for all the responses, guys!
---
One could probably cosplay a really legit Illidan with those infusions..
---
just one?? Booo
---
but I'd like to be able to use my infusions on other characters so something like the new toy tab would be great
---
Ben P. commented on this in a [forum post](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/78926/recent-pvp-queuing-instability):
---
&gt;Hey everyone. Just wanted to put up a quick note that we are actively investigating the issue with getting stuck unable to queue up for PvP matches. This bug is something that would come up occasionally in the past.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;A bit of simplified explanation: For a currently unknown reason, players are sometimes not removed from the roster (group) they were in during a PvP match. Then, when you try to queue up, the system sees that you're in an active roster and decides to do nothing. As this used to be somewhat rare, we created some scripts that comb the system looking for old rosters and clear them out, which would fix the problem. These scripts can only be run so often and against rosters of a certain age, since the automated tournament system keeps players in the same roster for longer periods and we don't want to destroy those rosters.
---
&gt;In the last 2-3 weeks, the frequency of this bug has gone up dramatically and we're not sure why, though we have some thoughts on ways to work around it. We're currently in the process of building some additional logging to further help us track down the issue.
---
&gt;We understand that this is extremely frustrating, it is for us as well. We'll keep you updated as we get more information.
---
Mirage has been out of the meta and not too strong a pick outside low to mid tier for a while, that might change your mind.
---
Everything else has been toned down quite a bit. The big problem now in higher tier is Rev and to some extent Holo (Firebrand and Scourge but only in AT is mandatory)
---
I think the counterpoint to that is: given how long people have been begging for build templates, if they were going to monetise them would that really have waited so long to add them?
---
I do wonder if there is anything they could add to them that would ever make me consider spending money.
---
&gt;This can bbe fixed by joining party of someone else and he triggers new queue. It will ask you to accept, and then you are normally queued and can cancel it and it is fixed.
---
tried already
---
Some NPCs even in core maps(near arah dungeon) used to rez you even if your are completely dead.
---
Does PvP/WvW have legendaries? Haven’t played in a bit
---
I have gone through the Warmaster and Sieran while the only 1 haven't is Tybalt. 
---
While my sibling likes Trahearne the most 
---
So far I'm most attached to Blish &amp; Gorrik.
---
He Lives on in all of "US"    Apples, Apples Anyone?
---
I know Trahearne is widely disliked, but he was my fave. The end of HoT hit me hard...
---
its very easy, the entire game i paid for in 2012 is now free lol
---
you only need the banner not this item, check the collection again and you will see it unlocked
---
That wouldn't work for GW business model. They want you to look at the fancy stuff so that you want it and pay for it. If you don't like it, then you weren't going to pay for it anyway so they don't care.
---
Until the bug is fix you should stop using entangled root. I run condi soul beast w/ stance share and use my pets for cc as needed. Honestly, until I saw this post I would of never known was entangled root was bugged. 
---
But than again I had to scroll thru the comments to see the link, and that's the main problem for this post. Well you can't edit the title you edit and re-edit the body. You can also make a new post with the correct information in it in the correct format. Be mindful of mobile users too. And this post is not mobile user friendly. :|
---
About 3 months ago my sibling went to Southern Cove through an Asura Gate with a iirc lv40 character and got 1-hit by the Drake. 
---
That was the 1st time we go there.
---
Discord is a pig of a program with no explanations offered.  Same goes for Facebook hogging up-channel as well.
---
Yes so much this.
---
Like everyone with those Infusions and stuff is using them to annoy other players right? And players who are using them actually dont like them themselves right?
---
My sibling's favourite character is Trahearne and the favourite line is "Well done, Commander."
---
Yes and No. I enjoy giving the group seizures as a greatsword mesmer with 4 visual infusions and flame armor. Set everything to neon yellow. Brightlord Phoenix coming through!
---
So you want to scale skyscales, but not while they're scaling, you only want to scale them while they're in the sky? So they are sky scaled, but not scaled while not in the sky?
---
Now you lost me, there's too much scaling up going on here and that's the opposite of what I wanted..
---
why do people care so much about how other people's choose their characters to look like?
---
So it'll basically never  open up? Or does it open up during EU times when NA ppl are asleep?
---
Good to know thanks :)
---
I speculate the price will go either down or up.
---
Prayer.
---
Just close your eyes then
---
HoT and PoF stories themselves are much shorter than the core story since they only encapsulate the arc finale (you have entire seasons preceeding them). As such they have less instances spread about even less maps, so there are also somewhat bigger time gaps berween them. As opposed to the core story, these arent meant for you to plow through them and jump from one to the next, moreso since theres no standard leveling between them to pace it. This is why masteries were added, as obtaining those by actually spending time, participating and actively playing in their designated maps will open up avenues towards more content, be it story or extras. It is not content you finish in a day or two, cause then it wouldnt be as epic.
---
Tbh it's not hard to get gold. I started WoW last year and only paid RLC for my initial 3 months. I've paid up till next month in ingame currency and have enough for another year, during which time I'll still be making $. And nope, I don't really farm gold. 
---
Yeah, I don't like a sub based model either, I held off on WoW for years. GW2's free trial is also lot less limited, my friend hit fractal level 100 on a free account...
---
Combat in WoWPvP isn't fun tbh. Oh wow a rogue stunned me for 7s, then Disorient me for another 7s of stun. My stunbreaks are on a 90s and 3min cd respectively... and the rogue has another combat stun he can reduce to a short cd. At least in GW2 there's skill in dodging big telegraphs.
---
But yeah the gear treadmill is awful. Imagine coming back to WoW and **your BiS gear is now outranked by questing greens from the newest xpac**. In GW2 you can never go wrong with cheap exotics.
---
GW2's banking, reagent mat, mount, auction house systems are all VASTLY superior to WoW's. WoW has the advantage of 14 years of content though, I'm sorry to say. There's like 5-6 raids every single expac. GW2 just doesn't have the size to keep up with the content flow. Which is a shame since GW2's systems feel great whereas WoW's just feel outdated. GW2's mounts are so lovingly made and unique I think they should be the industry standard. 
---
(By the way, I laugh to myself whenever I see someone using the GW2 UI mod for WoW. Behold it [here](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/gw2-ui).)
---
Being comparable to one tier of a collection for a legendary doesn't make it equal to the whole journey
---
Yeah no shit their far from being unobtainable, but Skyscale is nowhere near as bad to get as any Legendary. Skyscale was trivial to acquire. Timegates and stacks of Material =/= Legendary  Journey
---
It's not even close to the same as seeing it animated.
---
Boo hoo. Tell me something we don't know already.
---
Collecting volatil magic refill your flight juice. There is somes "path" intentionnally created in saison 4 maps that cross the sky. Several in Jahai for example.
---
So if you follow those volatil magic paths, you kind of fly freely.
---
I had no clue that it would be unusable.... if I had known it would of never ended up in novelties to begin with.
---
nope. its under the toy section, under novelties.
---
thank u, thank u, thank u!
---
The one that gives your toon pink hearts that float up.
---
I just started GW2 since 2019! Welcome to the family.
---
it came out b4 aura were a thing. but yes, totally get your point! It really doesnt even belong as any of those..it should be a shoulder effect like nightfurry.
---
u my friend made a very smart move :P! i wish i had known what would happen.. i thought u would be able to use multi effects when i saw 4 slots. unfortunately, nope
---
It's nice to see there are new players here like me. I just started 2019 the content is much in the core game, and quite overwhelming if expansion included.
---
she can join DR which is linked with TC rn and keep a lookout on when the server opens to transfer in together.
---
yes it would. i used to stack them both everyday until that awful novelty patch happened.
---
Which infusion makes a noise? Other than the exotic bee (not infusion).
---
He has.. many. Phosphos. Poly.  And hes not my only infusion-heavy Charr. LOL
---
Recently there are a lot if guild banners everywhere in Tyria in wonder why but GW2 seems to be rejuvenating.
---
There's a BIG difference in how you get to know him depending on your path in the personnal story. If you play a Sylvari, it feels a lot more natural for him to come and take charge.
---
Otherwise, he feels very jaring and imposed on you.
---
&gt; disable backpacks
---
Please. I can't see where I'm going in mistlock because everyone and their dog has ad infinitum slapped on their loadout.
---
Yep, it's probably the rapid decrease in health as my Dragonhunter drops a trap when he switches like he gets damaged.
---
so, no chance it'll remain the same. gotcha
---
Time to get ascended gear my friend.. u have about 10 armor box slots and they all need ascended gear, as well as Agony Resistance. CONGRATZ on reaching 80, now the fun begins!!! Boost your stats to your liking and dive head first into the end game content. if u dont like that, theres always other classes you can lvl up. You even get achievements for doing other classes too!
---
He’s in the Stronghold pvp mode either fighting his way to cider, or fighting to keep the cider.
---
I'm down with it but please, no more crystals. I don't care what colour. If anything I'd like to see the brand shatter, giving us access to some new un-purple areas.
---
No, its really not. The community is more alive than ever. Plus there is still an entire new living world "season 5" thats going to be starting up. Gear up and hop in! We welcome u with open armz &lt;3
---
Not true. I do it because it amuses me. Honestly... I KNOW its horribly gaudy, and I KNOW its obnoxious. But, thats why I love it and I find it amusing. I play for me. Not to satisfy anyone else.   
---
My auras arent because they are pricey, or draw attention. I just love the laugh. As well. I love being able to spot myself in a zerg. ;)  Gets me healed fast!!!!
---
Any news about the state of Swiss style tournaments and on demand tournaments in pvp?
---
[removed]
---
Well, I'm a beginner and I'm still learning, it's not the thing I spend my days on, but I take note of the criticisms anyway.
---
But just to know, have you ever tried to film players sliding into your guild hall in 20minuted only ?
---
Hmm, don't you have to wait a lot for people to come around to do hps?
---
@vinylnarcissus  How many cosmetic auras do you own? How frequently do you stack them? Do you like / dislike how they look once you stack them?
---
I didn't feel that way going through the first time as a human, although going through later as a Sylvari, I definitely felt it was more natural. I guess he just grew on me quickly.
---
She says it the mission beforehand.
---
Tybalt died a hero, Forgal died a badass motherfucker. But Sieran died too soon. RIP. &lt;/3
---
Best character they ever put in the game. Fucking amazing. An engineer Harley Quinn? ohgodyespls.
---
Thank fuck she didn't play the Priory. Sieran is *really* heartwrenching. Tybalt at least gets what he kind of wanted.
---
Wait, these are limited to 5 per account per day? Going to start buying these then.
---
Was thinking I could just dump volatile magic and get as much as I wanted.
---
hi. 
---
I downloaded GW2 fresh and put d3d9.dll into installdir GW2 bin64 folder. I can log in and click on Play but then I get a crash with this log for Arenanet if I choose to send.
---
 [https://pastebin.com/YKPaRzmM](https://pastebin.com/YKPaRzmM) 
---
Can you please help?
---
this is a intel 3770k on z77 motherboard with 8 GB of RAM and GTX 1070. Windows 10 64 Pro.
---
draw effect on verd is great for necros though; i was building it for one of mine until necro offhand nerfs ('changes')
---
Yea those are both fantastic ideas.
---
And yes the awakened troops work well, but they do have you run without your build for that mission basically
---
You don't even need a glitch to make casino coins easy, the skyscale alone makes it so easy as it is. (Not that it was hard before but it's nice to not need to change mounts at all)
---
I don't get why they don't go and change these to bundles .. who buys just 1?
---
Personally I'd rather go 4 over my target goal on an extremely rare occasion vs having to click 5 times for every one of these prompts on every character every day.
---
She usually updates the sites with patches, events, new item releases, etc. and yes, there's been plenty of content that she would otherwise have posted that she's missed. It isn't just game updates, but news, for several different titles, which is unfortunate as it was a quick way to see what's new with the games I play as opposed to digging through patch notes or dealing with the joy of reddit.
---
;D there are a few ppl earning money the  easy way.
---
prices won't drop until the market is flooded 2.0 with them
---
I thought you quit the game since I never saw you online! Glad you're back (or glad I was wrong)
---
It's not just for the guides, jackass - it's a quick way to get news about games we play, i.e., information about patches, events, future content, new items, etc. and has basically been how I stay up to date with games I don't play as much anymore.
---
I mean you can always upload to another channel
---
If someone else has the energy to aggregate news for multiple MMO titles, start recording their own guides, and showcasing new items.. now is your chance to start your own site and generate some side money w/ affiliate links. Especially if you have attention to detail and can maintain social media updates.
---
But there's other things you can buy with it... its not like this is the only time you'll want the currencies most likely...and some are already bundled. Its odd.
---
The weird thing is that she's missing out on income if she was properly monetizing her site/videos.
---
i hope you added them all to your friend list!
---
Oof.
---
He speaks in such a slow and boring tone, that's what pissed me up the most. Also what he says is like talking to a 5 year old kid.
---
Because they have more life experience than you?!
---
they dont sell it shop, but you can technically just craft up to the precursor you want and then not invest in the gifts to make it legendary. effectively 'buying' the skin buy paying for mats to craft it
---
Seems like a very unlikely scenario...plus..the other ones are bundled...... they should change these to bundles too
---
this is exactly how i got the perfected rifle skin ;)
---
&gt; I mean you can always upload to another channel
---
Where ? it's gw2 contenu so i post here
---
Well thats the risk isnt it. You could buy it now and it goes down or you could buy it later and pay double, im not sure any answer would help you as we do not have a crystal ball.
---
Years ago I bought the queen bee for just over 900g, I doubt I would pay todays prices and it isnt about how much money one has, I have a decent amount of wealth, its what I decide is what I wish to pay for something :)
---
PvP is like Linux. Everyone talks about it but it comes down to a single-digit fraction that actually uses it.
---
i dont want another ad infinitum, they should just make a cape and everyone would play fractals.
---
We cant even zoom in on our characters in the Hero panel   T\_T ..
---
Thanks for your suggestion, I will try to later include streamable links to discussion pages of the infusions I own.
---
How are they supposed to prevent this? Time gate in the tp?
---
Guess we now have a point for the prompt..
---
I actually managed to catch it happening :) This time she appears to be getting right into the fray lol
---
[Aurene](https://i.postimg.cc/fysKVcw1/dragonbro.jpg)
---
my guess would be that the api has troubles atm.
---
Bee is available as an infusion too
---
Bank slots are monetized
---
Character slots are monetized
---
Bag slots are monetized
---
You really don't see how build slots could be monetized?
---
Annnnddd your proposal still seeks to inadvertently gut the infusion market and restrict player freedom, but what do I know right? 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Others are asking the same: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/byiqme/gw2_efficiency_precursor_crafting_not_showing/
---
I wonder how Anet is going to fare once we have anti-lootbox laws here in the United States, they can’t just ban the US like they can with Belgium.
---
Maybe we’ll finally get a quality of life improvement with the gemstone.
---
Slightly disingenuous to compare a string of text above a player to visually noisy infusions which disrupt combat and performance. 
---
It'd also be neat if people stopped pretending to be naive with the whole 'turn off character models' thing. Of course people know this feature exists. People would like to simply disable infusions without having the settings indiscriminately removing everyone's visuals.
---
Sometimes it be like it do.
---
So People can arrive. And the group can get more loot. I belive the "you get more loot" is more of a trick than anything to make people not be dicks?
---
There’s no other. More just poking fun at Anet for doing one thing and saying another. Love them and the game, just funny is all.
---
Honestly it seems like an unnecessary change.  You can buy 5 at a time still, it's basically meaningless.
---
Back in Season 1, I thought there wasn’t even one character I was invested in enough to be sad if they died.
---
Then they killed [](#s "Lion’s Arch") and I was shocked.
---
You might wanna change your character model limit to low or medium instead of lowest.
---
Anet's quarterly earnings are being calculated by clicks-per-minute.
---
Thats explains the  guild hall decoration dude.
---
Cant beat Discord, set up your own server and you can do all of that and more
---
Probably a default prompt for anything that has an account limit. Hopeful they changed it in the future.
---
Definitely sounding like it's your video card.
---
This. You don't want to kill the brandstone before everyone gets a chance to get there. It's not about your loot. It's about courtesy.
---
That probably is very complicated in it's implementation and maybe not even possible technically, however I like the idea it just probably isnt worth the incredible effort it would take to devop.
---
The description of the problem I give in the post is really bad, it is very hard to describe it. But I can add that with pixels in where they shouldn't be I mean more like lines of textures, idk.
---
*Slow clap*
---
&gt;	I am utterly baffled why anyone thinks that they will monetise build templates.
---
How is this idea baffling in any way? They’re a business.. Plenty of in-game features have already been monetized.
---
PvP is an abandoned gamemode, has been since ESL got shut down years ago.
---
I don't know what's wrong with this?
---
I'm not using any graphical mods, drivers are up to date and guild wars is fixed. Just now i experienced same glitches while playing csgo, although my gpu was only running ~62C temperature
---
It's exactly what it is. And it's stupid anyway, so I too hope they change it in the future. OP's question would be the same for any other item with a daily limit. It doesn't matter what the item is, the warning makes no sense. If you want to purchase something, why would you change your mind just because it's limited per day ? If anything, the limit is one more reason to complete the purchase ...
---
&gt;where I can add/remove people and keep track of players/classes.

Excel
---
Thank you, I was in a hurry and didn't see the other tread. :)
---
If she's starting on a free account with plans to buy an expansion down the road, just have her pick another NA server for now. She will get a free transfer when she upgrades her account, so you two can just level/gear up your WvW characters in PvE while you wait for TC to open.
---
There is a relink  in a few weeks, so Different server link we have no idea which server it will be.
---
About your excuse about matchmaking, I am pretty sure unranked has no matchmaking whatsoever. Its always a random collection of players with extremely different skill levels. (why a queue still lasts ages, I dont know. Maybe the player count is so low finding 10 people is difficult)
---
Ranked does a good job at good matchmaking. But the low player count hinders it. I always tell people to just play Ranked. Yes, you might fall to the bottom, but is that bad? The chances of getting fair matches increases and you can work your way back up as you gain experience.
---
Just going Ranked as new player is better, simply because it has matchmaking (and is more rewarding).
---
pvp rank (deer, tiger, dragon...) doesnt matter, it has nothing to do with skill of the player. stop playing unranked and go ranked, then again youd have to accept that the game shows your low rating.
---
Just wait a minute or two, then queue and you'll get different players. You could also try queuing for stronghold, generally more new players are in there. 
---
You can also go into 1v1 dual arena servers and ask someone for practice, that is a good way to get good quick. 
---
Lastly, try to join a guild and play with some friends, it'll make unranked far more enjoyable. This game is one of the most social MMOs out there, and it's easy to find a PvX guild with newer players like you. It'll also make blowout games a lot less likely. 
---
If you want an excuse to why matchmaking is unfair, you'll always find one. I've heard every reason possible why the matchmaking sucks. But in the end, if it's not enjoyable, then just don't play. If you just focus on the game rather then your teammates, it becomes far more enjoyable.
---
Chances are though, if you're being instant killed over and over, then it's practically a 4v5, and that explains the blowouts. It also could just be bad luck. But that's just my guess.
---
Stop complaining and let me explain.... PvP is the long game not the short so don’t expect easy gains. Remember the max rank title is 10k wins and years of dedication to format.
---
Ranked = Randomway (low tier skill level)
---
Unranked = 5 man organized team (All skill levels)
---
AT/mAT = Automated Tournament (mAT is the monthly and has a very VERY high skill bar to win)
---
_______
---
Ranked is where you will find toxic pip farmers and how you get PvP rewards... Most of the high ranked players don’t play ranked.
---
Unranked is where you can be steam rolled by one of the tournament teams having a practice session (everyone trains and tests new builds and guess where... UNRANKED!)
---
So if you are getting constantly beat up.. It could be a factor of how GOOD they are vs the factor of how BAD you are (as a new player to the format).
---
In the off season (so now).. Unranked is full of medium tier player (gold/platinum) because they are bored and can finally team up 5 strong.
---
5plats are gonna rick roll ya... Think of it like your emotes. You are a deer and they are 5dragons... take your lumps, burn marks, and move on...
---
And you are correct..
---
The ranked season will give you a rating and you’ll get games with people at your cumulative rating BUT be careful what you wish for because any team of 5deer ranks isn’t going very far so you just have to learn to “get in where you fit in” and be humble about it (even if where you fit in is way down at the bottom today... tomorrow it’s a bit further up and one day maybe you could even get a statue like team USA eh?)
---
So to wrap it all up the main reason you are losing so often is because you are playing unranked in the off season so you are playing against far more skilled opponents.
---
You must play enough to earn your dragon and get a better understanding of gw2 PvP, or walk away and quit.
---
Honestly it’s not for everyone but if you can find joy in the format PvP is the true living game.
---
It changes with each balance patch to something totally new and lives because we put life into it (completely unpredictable and real because we are PC, not NPC) so PvP is the truly living format
---
Good luck and don’t let a few off season lumps turn you off from playing gw2 PvP (heck you are going to have full days of losing streaks long before you have full days of winning so you need to remember this is the long game.. not the short)
---
The problem with Stronghold is ArenaNet's retarded obsession with innovation at any cost. The only thing they needed to make SH successful was to copy the MOBA formula, but nooo, they have to give it their own spin, reinvent the wheel, and of course, the result is always terrible.
---
My stupidest achievement was to kill Sabetha daily for... months, 6-7 months at least. More than 250 Sabetha kills, even though she only gives reward once a week. I liked her so much.
---
Sadly it says per account so only five a day.
---
long post counter with long post - sorry for grammer :)
---
there are several problems you are facing:
---
a) its off season so everyone plaing unraked. In unraked your level dont mean anything and game just throwing people in ... you wait less, but heck when you get team of 5 random silver/gold players vs premade of 4 top guys..... 
---
this can be balance a little in seasons, when after placemet matches you get into your "league" -if you are good you go up, if you are bad you go down. But in the end you stay at some ranking you belong to, with 50/50 win to lose ratio. no matter what people around you saying (you will meet them - "I am good and only becouse everyone I play with suck, so i am in gold"... no you are not good, if you are good you get to top 100/250/at least plat 2 :) )
---
b) you face one of biggest issue -not on game side but on yours. I calling it "spiral of frustration". How its works? You start playing and lose, you may feel you tried and you get unlucky with bad teamamets -happend, then you play again and lose again -starting to be angry that you tried and people around you suck .... depend on how calm you can be it take 3-5 matches and you get angry and frustrated - when match dont go your way from start you give up - and I dont mean go afk, even if that hapend too, but just you dont belive you can win and play way worse then normal. its basic psychology and happend to everyone. Its end up with writing post on reddit about how pvp suck (I was there and wrote several such posts in past)
---
c) you are too new to pvp. even with good build it takes quite a few matches to get familair with your class, maps and who you can figth and who will just melt you. For me personaly it was 150 wins (Around 300 games) per class to feel I am somehow good (i did all of classes for achivs, and this 300 games was count on each of them). But even years later, with 5k+ win games and specialized for one class only I am far far far beyond top 100 (or as I say it -too good for gold, to bad for top 250)
---
d) there is of course issiue with balance -but its mostly about good players using good builds, which you cant counter as you are not so good. Even classes which are your counter in hands of bad players cant do nothing (i can see it in unraked as scourge going agaisnt repears (I should always lose 1on1) and win easily as other side dont know how to play it properly.
---
e) there is one of bigger problem of pvp, but you neither anet can actually do much against it. As you mention most of your games, and most of games in general, are steamroll of one team. Yes there are epic comeback when your team losing by 200 point and still win, or matches which end up 499/500- but 95% of games arent like that. either one team is way better, or you have someone bad (in spiral of frustartion) in losing team who give up, or there are people who give up when they see they cant win. And all it takes is 1 person to afk/dont really play as he/she can and you lose.
---
I don't my old one was a laptop
---
that makes me think
---
Hello,
---
I'm a bit struggling to complete the **Conservation of Magic** achievements. My progress: [https://i.imgur.com/IsMQY05.png](https://i.imgur.com/IsMQY05.png)
---
In total we have to help, 6 NPCs on 3 different maps:
---
**Blazeridge Steppes**
---
**Flinnz** \- Consortium 
---
**Keadin** \- Priory
---
**Mount Maelstrom**
---
**Garen** \- Priory
---
**Loonaloo** \- Consortium
---
**Snowden Drift**
---
**Shana** \- Consortium
---
**Fiona** \- Priory
---
And there's no clear timer, the timer seems different depending of the maps? Is there a timer of sorts for those events? 
---
My other issue is even when I tag up and recruit help, we fail the event most of the time. We're destroying the collectors, but they respawn so fast, and the smaller one are quite fast. The NPCs are very squishy too and it takes forever to revive them. Any tips? 
---
Seems to be that those events were tailored for big crowds but no one cares much about those past events anymore.
---
True, although you have to manually change it to 5, which resets as soon as you buy it so if you want 5 of each you have to click 4 extra times per material. If this prompt wasn't there you could just spamclick the mouse. If it bundles with 5 it would also be a QoL tweak.
---
Well I've seen people say the wrong stuff in map chat for years. Doesn't really mean much.  Most likely they either didn't understand what they were being told when someone said don't DPS or they were lied to to get them to stop DPSing and took it to heart.
---
Playing through Personal Story as Sylvari does seem to be better. Then on top of that, playing through Heart of Thorns as Sylvari is also a completely different - and arguably more interesting - experience.
---
Sylvari Master Race, anyone?
---
This bug can easily be reproduced by just feeding your skyscale some redbull.
---
I remember doing the same early on the game, and I couldn't cross Straits of Devastation either. The mob density there was huge (pity they nerfed it) and they saw you coming from miles away.
---
You could try sticking your monitor into the integrated graphics, assuming your motherboard has one. The game will run like shit, but you'll be able to see if the graphical errors are still there.
---
This is my favorite one
---
Brought back in about the same condition that Risen are brought back, too..
---
yep! i have shit taste in waifus
---
You have to let her get attached to the one character, though. You know, the scaly one that doesn't speak.
---
yes!!! join squads and see if anybody notices you’re a stupidly low level
---
scream and get ready to press m for the respawn
---
Stop using this homophobic asshole in memes.
---
yeah? what? I'm here.
---
This. Also, please offer a bundle of 5 already, too.
---
you can get many skins and ascended gear there fairly easy now with the reward tracks and skirmish tickets idk for how long we have them now
---
great axes would animation-wise be closer to hammers... then again reaper GS skills are based off of hammer skills. stretching normal axes to create skins aside, the repurposing of animations is quite common in (not only) gw2, and is rarely met with substantial negativity.
---
Good points... I'm guessing you're in favor then?
---
I actually love hammer animations.
---
No its not, its quite litterally the same system we have in the game right now.
---
Just press yes and stop typing
---
i'm not particularly against it, and i do enjoy a good great axe, but frankly it is quite far down on my own priority list, and probably even further down (if at all on it) on ANet's.
---
I have been here! It is exactly like the pictures, though I wouldn’t call it similar to Desert Highlands - More like the Maguuma Jungle. It was very foggy and cool when I visited, and the whole area is a very rich green. I saw lots of spider webs and small lizards. There’s many, many lakes and rivers.
---
   
---
There are vendors selling hot sweet potato all the way up the mountains. Also, there’s free WiFi on top :P
---
umh, ga already has an animation
---
But what class would use it, what is a point of having GA that is masked GS?
---
we want spears and pole-arms before axes.
---
Worth? NO!!! you will loose your dollaz ;)
---
YES!
---
Yeah, but you can quickly swap if you want, that's the beautry of special action keys, you don't have to talk with anyone or use anything if you drop the bundle weapon, you an re-equip it with the special action skill, allowing you to give orders, then switch to your skills and join the fight.
---
I fixed it (at least I think I did) by restarting my router to get a different IP address
---
Kind of that. My group uses a Google document, which is like excel, but online (browser/app).
---
Our lead has set it up so only she can change the essential boxes, like dates or special notifications, but everyone can fill in his name, classes, builds, if he will participate on a given date..
---
Awesome, thanks for showing us. I genuinely believe you now, it's just kind of crazy high compared to the other numbers I've been seeing, and I needed evidence. Ty, will probably farm this more now lol
---
But my point is that those people with 1.6k AP sometimes are top dps or keep boon uptime perfectly or do all their mechanics right too. I don't care how much LI someone has, I care if they get the group the kill lol
---
Here's how people think the brandstone work.  
---
1. Wait for the Brandstone to be marked with 5 marks.
---
2. Use the extraction beam
---
3. After every use of the beam, run into the meteor and press F to search for loot.
---
4. This should work about 3-4 times then people usually leave.
---
However, this is not entirely true and this is the part where it gets interesting. If the events lasts for the whole 5 mins. In the last minute of the event, if you've been using your extraction beam on cooldown, the brandstone "resets" and the prompt "Search" reappears on your screen for 3-4 more extractions.
---
This method usually nets about 60-80 kralk instead of the 30-50 you would get from 3-4 extractions + destroying the crystal to mine it. So to answer your question, yes there is more loot to be had by keeping the brandstone alive for the whole duration.
---
What type of variables you talking about?  Apart from the 2 clone opener vs gs2 ac opener its all the same no? 
---
Never really tried precasting stuff from other weapons in pugs, but if you say its consistent then i believe you, guess i could try it aswell on some bosses/classes.
---
Just because the numbers the other person was claiming are more in line with my experience, but you showed the evidence and I believe you now, I just had a hard time believing the number was so high. Apologies.
---

While the possibility obviously exists, the bafflement is more that people seem to be convinced that it WILL be monetised.
---
I usually don’t bother with this type of JP (it’s difficult, even with the prototype rewind tool). Fortunately, for some of the no-fly zone ones, there are, often, mesmers available who are willing to port you to the end.
---
 Hello there, haven't played GW2 before, could anyone give me a explanation of each class and what they excel at in endgame? Reading description on there wiki is very generic, and several times have I seen these be outdated before. Also how is the endgame here? Without a holy trinity, is it just anything goes? Long time wow/ffxiv player where holy trinity exists, haven't played too MMORPG's without it.
---
There is a little counter on the left side of the "buy" button. You can set it manually (up/down-button) or directly (kicking the number and typing in the amount you want) before you buy a lost ANYTHING in this game! *mind blown*
---
I got the one teal infractor, but that was my only rare drop. :(
---
Congrats!
---
I see how they could be monetised, but I think build templates are a fundamentally different kind of feature - something the game lacks rather than something that could be added.
---
If they removed this prompt, you’d be able to hammer the Buy button until you have what you want.
---
Oh shit, never realised that. 
---
I also found out about health bar percentages yesterday. 
---
I've been playing for five years lmao.

The final boss fight of HoT hit me like a sack of bricks right in the feels.

silhouette might look similar to an axe, but that is 100% a hammer. [this guy's axe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Axemaster_Hareth) however is a hammer skin.
---
Now just imagine if they did NOT have the time-gate on it, so you would be "forced" to do all the grind at the same time? 
---
The main issue (which is probably what you experience) is that people are unable to see the game as entertainment and want everything ASAP. That will lead to burnout, regardless of how much one likes something.
---
I am currently working on my third account for it...its not soo bad the next few times around.
---
But aren't you then limited to the cosmetic infusion? You can't then use a regular one alongside it, right? 
---
I was thinking having them separate would mean you could use the cosmetic ones without sacrificing the infusion slot in your gear.
---
hey ok
---
Ah nah, that I disabled a while back.
---
&gt;And yes i only play WvW because for me there is no end game in PvE beside raids which i hate...

Isn't it in DragonFall?
---
The map itself is 15 per heart per character, no?
---
You can't increase the amount further than the prompt tells you before you buy
---
Wow, why do you have so many accounts? Also, aren't you extremely bored and tired of the game from playing so muhc?
---
I think Jaw made a good job recently, it is a good overview for both pve and pvp: https://youtu.be/MRLXhKvspsc

Hm... U couldn't handle a relatively fast (not counting timegates) grind?

Maybe mmos aren't for you then :3

Your reading comprehension skills need work is the problem I see.
---
Noted! Time to move my alt parkings :)
---
Depends on the language you play ^^
---
reading, you're doing that wrong
---
That requires you to already be interested in buying them right now, and if that were the case you'd already get told when you try to actually buy them. There should be something like "0/5" in the space between the item name and the cost.
---
You may want to use Lutris and set it up through there, from what I've gathered the performance on Steam is terrible overall.

There's some changes you can do that'll get you a huge performance boost but that'd take longer to explain.

There's also this that appears to be the best solution performance wise but I haven't used it.

Yeah, that vendor is in Dragonfall. But it's the Volatile Magic vendor in base camp where you can buy all other LWS4 materials for Volatile Magic.

For me, I only started to feel burnt out from this collection because I was also wrapping up my first Legendary and into that last sprint. So I wanted something a bit more laid-back. I was fine with the overall duration of the Skyscale collection (as in, it had a lot of parts), but feeling like *I needed* to get each leg of it done before reset "or else" (or else what, really I couldn't really say, it was just Anxious Brain™) was what started to tire me out on it.
---
Then it got to Skyscale feeding and...that was the easy collecting I needed. Pop in, feed her, clean her, play with her, and go continue with whatever I felt like doing. The fact of the matter is, I probably would have still taken a week to do the entire thing and been okay with it. But the time gates made me feel like I had a time limit per day and that aspect stressed me out. In the future, going by Tyrian days for complex collections is preferable imo. I'll probably enjoy a week-long collection more if I know I won't be missing some cut-off point, in fact.
---
And the hearts don't often fill quickly enough

I remember 2 years ago during Halloween, my friends and I saw “John Cena” who wielded both the legendary axes. Loved that man. We all did, and he replied a couple times as John Cena. A shirtless warrior
---
Let me honest. If you did not played LWS1 you have no idea, why Rox so attached to charrs from islands. I literally had no idea why is she acting like this, or even who in the hell is she. Braham at least somewhat mentioned in HoT, Taimi in LWS2, lesbi-duo...in PoF? for like 1 mission. It's almost like they never actually tried to think from perspective of players who never played LWS1
---
Manipulate drop rates.  It’s simply supply and demand.
---
He gave you an opinion.
---
Why will it go down then?
---
From a purely economic gold/hr standpoint, courtesy doesn't matter at all. But the GW2 community in general tends to take a less selfish approach, willing to sacrifice a small amount of personal gain to let more people benefit. It's why you see stuff like what OP is talking about, or people stopping to kill mobs and rez dead randos, or commanders on daily event completer maps reminding people not to use mounts/aoe/elite skills and finishing things before players on foot can get there. None of it is gonna benefit your wallet, but they're nice choices that help people out.
---
Pretty much this, i feel some of it because the vast majority don't keep a stockpile of a stack of each currency when the maps come live for future use. So when they play their week (lets be honest day for some) of living story content, they expect to be able to get everything. When they can't we get the rage and grind people are forcing upon themselves.
---
For the love of god PLEASE make a screenshot and don't take a fucking picture of your screen.
---
They should give a good reason to ecto gamble.  I thought that was supposed to be a sink in the first place.  After significant analysis I assume people concluded it was definitely not worth it to gamble and it’s not done too much anymore.
---
I’m not talking about flooding the economy with gold, I’m thinking exclusive skins or something.

3000 IQ reddit post
---
&gt; Well, isn't that what everybody does?
---
no, it isn't.
---
I don't typically make lists of all the things that are abandoned while playing, I just notice and make a mental note.
---
Nearly every time I get into dry top it's t2. If you get dropped into an overflow you get nothing.
---
You haven't always needed prep for t6, you just needed to rally who was present to take on different events. You can't do that presently in multiple maps because the bodies just aren't present.
---
Is it stackable? If not then that will lower the total demand.
---
One guy says stop market manipulation and you say manipulate drop rates. What?
---
This brought a tear to my eye.
---
my experience differs from yours, totallly and completely. It means your mental notes are annecdotal. You said no one does Dry Top and at the moment you said it, I want there and it was already at T3 going to T4.  
---
It took organization to get to T6 even at the beginning. People were so used to following tags. They didn't divide up and do enough events. They didn't know how to get the bonus events. I went to many many different maps early on that failed to get to T6, even maps that made the attempt.  Sand almost always gets to T6, though because they now have it down to a science. That wasn't the case back then.
---
But getting to T4 regularly doesn't show the zone is deserted.
---
Plenty of people think something is deserted because they are on a nearly empty server, where there's another full server doing something. Some commanders take their groups down when servers fill up. I know I do.  Gives the next server a better chance to advertise.
---
You saying something is true with absolutely nothing to back it up means about as much as me saying it. When you make that list, get back to me. Until then my experience doesn't bear out your experience. Even today when I tested the one thing you listed.
---
Either expansion will unlock [masteries](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery) (including Core Tyria) for you when you reach level 80 and do the first expansion story step.
---
The story for both expansions require a level 80 character. The story chronologically takes place later than personal story or season 1-2. (But that doesn't mean you have to do all of the story in order.)
---
If your account is free to play (not created before Aug 29, 2015), you'll also drop these [F2P restrictions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Free_accounts) by getting an expansion.
---
All of the expansion maps and the majority of the content is intended for level 80's.
---
Various expansion tiers do give you 'now' perks, such as the gems from deluxe and ultimate, as well as other items like the glider skin, outfit and Lily of the Elon pass. (I think you need to complete the first story step for the latter, but you can use it on any character after that)
---
Up there with "you must type out the complete long name of this item before you can delete it" on useless achievement trash.
---
The expansions for the game are great, but they arnt totally necessary, especially before level 80. Once you buy them you get their perks, but most of these perks require you to be level 80 to start using
---
I disagree.  Which other hearts become troublesome with more players trying to do them (upscaling aside)?  I cannot think of many, because other hearts are timed well and don't have disappearing items and buggy NPCs.  One of the things that make this game so smooth to play is the shared resources.  You and I can each pick up the same environmental item and go do different things with it - We don't have to wait on each other nor do we have to sit on ass and wait for respawn.  This is not the case with buckets of water on this heart.
---
Waiting until later isn't a good solution, and it's not in the spirit of this game.  There are 5 problems on this heart, minimum.
---
&gt;Did they deliver the promise ?
---
Depends on what you're thinking of.  The core gameplay of WvW is largely the same as it's always been.  The new PoF specs, as well as just general balance updates, has shifted the meta of fights, but you're still running around capping objectives for PPT.  They did change up PPT calculations a while back so that off-hours coverage isn't as big a deal (though it's still pretty important).  You can also glide (with limitations), and there's a new WvW-exclusive mount as well.
---
&gt;Did they add new buildings, sieges , new bosses or even new events in WvW ? 
---
I believe the Shield Generator is new from the last time you would have played.  It's a siege that can project shields to temporarily protect your siege/zerg from enemy siege/projectiles.  That's the only new siege, afaik.  No new buildings, but objectives now have "tactivator" levers which can be triggered for powerful effects on large cooldowns, like temporary wall invulnerability, emergency WP, etc.  No new bosses.  No new evergreen events, though they are in the habit of running week-long special events with different rules, like no down-state, accompanied by increased WXP and reward track gain.
---
&gt;What about the rewards? Can we finally get skins, ascended gear, legendaries or even farm gold on par with PvE ?
---
Gold farming still pales in comparison to the best PvE farms.  That said, it's a lot better than it used to be.  PvP reward tracks have been implemented in WvW, as well as a few tracks exclusively for WvW.  You make pretty steady progress as long as you're active, and most of the tracks are quite rewarding, imo.  Ascended gear can be obtained through WvW, though it's a good deal more expensive than crafting, except for a handful of expansion stats.  Legendaries are also farmable; in addition to the standard legendary weapons, there's a unique legendary backpack, and it's possible to get legendary armor as well.  The backpack has a unique skin (and comes with a unique glider skin too!) while the armor shares a skin with the regular ascended WvW armor, but you get all the QoL stuff (stat and rune swapping).  **tl;dr** WvW isn't the place to go for raw gold per hour, but it doesn't just feel like a total waste of time anymore. 
---
Also, one other nice change they made is a commander can designate a small number of people as scouts, and they'll get rewarded based on the accomplishments of the larger squad. So no more sacrificing personal reward for the benefit of your server!
---
Anet manipulate drop rates.  For example if they want to reduce price manipulation, increase the drop rate so the price goes down naturally.
---
Going into combat faster and how the Power Chrono benchmark ends on a burst are worth of consideration. I didn’t really put much thought into it when i uploaded it since a heavy amount of RNG is involved when benchmarking anyways, and I always look into the classes rather than just comparing raw numbers.
---
Yeah, this heart is a pain in the ass. Anything that makes it easier to complete is good on my book.
---
Could it just have a hover-over text saying “limited purchase: 5 per day”. Prompt windows always suck.
---
It’s enjoyable because that’s what an MMO is supposed to be. Keeps you playing, if you don’t like it that’s totally fine it’s an optional mount. The 250 currency wasn’t too bad personally, obviously not everyone feels the same, but when you put on a podcast or show in the background to watch it’s not that bad at all. I had to get 1000 currency from jahai and kourna for the achievement armor and Backpiece for those maps, and even then I only just barely became burnt out because I was running out of things to watch. You need 1k or so for the achievements in thunderhead, and when I found that out I said fuck it, I’ll skip the thunderhead achievement.
---
Granted I think the grind is worse for people that don’t have a couple hours a day to play the game but want the Skyscale, hell usually I don’t have a couple hours I’ve just been free the last couple weeks. MMOs are not known for being quick and ez, they’re known for consuming your time like a black hole, so you have to learn how to make that black hole more fun if the base game isn’t to entertaining. Using other characters I don’t usually play for doing the hearts and stuff made it more fun for me personally cause I sucked at those characters and got to learn their skill set. Watching stuff in the background is a great start, then maybe chilling with some friends or something in discord.
---
Don't you have the option of collecting stuff underwater too?
---
The prompt itself is fine. What it needs is a "don't ask again" checkbox.
---
I liked going around and seeing places I haven't seen. I enjoyed to hide and seek and the game of fetch. I did my usual world boss train to get my skyscale.
---
I enjoyed it. Not the 250 collection, because I grinded it, but the rest was smooth sail.
---
That is probably fastest.
---
Erm no... the prompt didn’t help at all (except in the sense that it is so useless that someone started a thread about it and then ppl learned about the limit). It only tells you after you start buying, which is useless when you’re planning your purchases before making them.

Trying to get back into Guild Wars 2 again, but I'm running into an issue. I've forgotten my password, and i'm not receiving password reset emails from noreply@guildwars2.com.
---
I set up sms authentication on my account a few years back, and that still works, i get the codes by text and can enter them, the website even then says its specifically sending an email to my email address, but i get nothing. I've followed all the advice on there site as well, I've checked spam, junk deleted, i've no filters, the emails just don't arrive.
---
I've already brought this up with support, but they've been... I'm honestly not sure if i'm talking with a bot or not. Everytime i reply to them i get another email from the same GM saying they've send another password reset email to me, and to let them know if i don't get it. this has happened about five or six times already, and i've started asking in my replies if there's anything else they can do since this isn't working, but the GM just replies saying the exact same damn thing again and again, and i never receive that password reset link.
---
Anyone got any advice? Even just how to get an actual human to talk to me over support would be helpful.
---
The few times I went underwater, I was eaten quickly by something (piranha?).  Since I have not ventured below.  Please tell me what I am doing wrong.
---
No. I wouldn't play if I didn't enjoy the game. All of my extra accounts are used for daily login rewards the Skyscale makes exploration on those accounts much easier so its a worthwhile investment.

There are actual, visible fish in the zones where you get eaten. They can be a bit hard to see from inside one, but they're there.

So does Guild Wars. Both PvE and PvP use megaservers, only WvW doesn't. There are various reasons for that, but even Anet realized that they no longer apply so they're working on a massive update to change that. But even now there are several ways to play WvW with someone on a different server.

Yup. I started in 2014 (during the first Fot4W) and I have zero attachment to any of those characters. TBH, I’m more interested in the Rytlock/Logan story and what happened to Zojja than any of the LS1 characters’ stories.
---
Just do a little part of it per session, and do something else until you do next part again.
---
Haha yeah I just finished sunrise and the skyscale came out and then vision and I was like phew! Lots of new stuff coming out. It’s pretty nice and we just have to take a breather haha. 
---
I think we should just enjoy the skyscale for now and do some metas and take it easy. After awhile you’ll feel the itch to tackle some long term project again.
---
But are you going to repeat that 17 times?
---
People see Trahearne as the new Kormir. No fuckin clue why people like him.

Just don’t blame anet, inability to read is client-side
---
&gt;I just don't ... want to play anymore.  
---

---
Big blame on the "Do these dailies and get a reward in X days" achievements.
---
As far as Skyscale's concerned, I'm at the minigames part.  
---
First part so far was the most tedious. Not looking forward to grinding map currencies.
---
HoT maps are hard to get around and it can take grinding to get the masteries.  It remains hard to get around even after you have the masteries, it is just possible.
---
PoF maps are much more like core maps.  There are areas gated by the mounts, but it is much easier to tell.  One mount lets you jump across chasms, one lets you jump higher, one lets you fly over quicksand/swamp.  So if you see a mesa you cannot climb to, you know you need the high jumping mount.
---
I almost never play in HoT maps and love playing in PoF maps.
---
My favorite like this was a giant male norn mesmer, named Truely Confusing iirc. He was Ronald McDonald. All yellow, red boots and gloves, red fro, terrifying clown mask, and wielding the chainsaw greatsword. I ran some DS metas with him a month or so ago and saw him a few times in the world boss rush too. Every time I saw him it made my day.
---
This is bulshit. Mmorpgs are supposed to be grindy, so saying you got burnout after doing skyscale collection is like being mad at mmorpg because it s mmorpg.
---
no, because I went slow and just finished it a few days back.

When I first started playing my son was really into my personal story. I got to the part where Tonn died and he lost his mind. Seeing his dead body floating in the water was to much for him. I ended up finding another asura randomly and telling him it was Tonn.

You need the Jerkin for this collection.

Just something to note for next time, when something is wrong / not working on GW2E, you can be 95% sure that the official GW2 API is at fault. And up that to 99.9% if there hasn't been any update on GW2E during that time.

&gt; Only 1 player can pick up a water bucket.
---
But there are more than 1 bucket around (most of the time).
---
&gt; When approaching a passed out pirate to pour water on them, they sometimes spontaneously wake up and walk away!
---
They just don't always start a fight. It's a pretty common thing for hearts. Waking up the Skritts in Ember Bay is another good example for this mechanic.
---
&gt; Killing Alehound Raiders within the heart boundary doesn't reward completion.
---
Because it's not part of the heart. If event mobs reward competion or not depends on what tasks the heart gives you.
---
no, they don't need an overhaul..as you said the game is balanced around risk reward and this means active mitigation will almost always be superior
---
most tanking scenarios have just the one tank anyway! and like half the raid fights don't have a tank at all
---
i don't even get what you want..to have the single individual doing the tanking be a bit beefier? memestrel is a thing and so is nomad
---
if you don't think there is a huge difference between mostly nomad and zerker/diviner mix in terms of handling hits..well, dunno what to say
---
I think you're missing a few points here, so let's go with the first one I noticed: What game mode are you even talking about ? Going by the feeling I get it's PvE, because if you complained about these in a PvP setting you clearly have no clue how oppressive bunker builds already are.
---
Now for the PvE aspect: You're not meant to facetank everything, that's not how it works. You have dodged, blocks and damage mitigation and you gotta work out which skills do damage and which don't. Running a defensive set will allow you to tank more of the small/autoattacks but big hits, e.g. including a charge-up or indicator, are meant to kill you if you facetank them. If you still try to, well that's on you for not using the survival methods you are given.
---
GW2 is not WoW where you can just run a tank spec, facetank everything and still survive and solo everything simply by outsustaining it.
---
Don't worry, we will. And we do not have to prove anything, we have quite low recruiting requirements comparing to the fake.
---
Omg you found it! If it helps at all, I was a human necro with white and dark ice green armour. I had a couple leystone armour pieces and (if it was you guys) you kept calling me a "tall quaggan friend" haha
---
She talks about being a gladium, and she appears in LWS2 and 3
---
stats in this game aren't meant to carry you.  
---
you can have full zerk gear and bad dps because you play it wrong. this game is meant to be played skillfully. if you wanna tank, do it. use your blocks, blinds and cc and you can "tank".
---
It really was! Gw2 is already a pretty cute game, but, this made my heart melt (I mean how could it not have? Quaggan are just the cutest!)
---
tbh its not worth it, i got my skyscale and its subpar even with masteries maxed
---
We've (FA) been matched against bg for over a month. It's awful. I don't think they do it for gem transfers I think they just don't care. 
---
Which is pretty sad considering the potential of the game mode. Neglect rules spvp and wvw.
---
Remove Vitality and Toughness. No tanking, just make a Control role instead. 
---
Add two new stats. Aggression and Denial. 
---
* Aggression buffs hard disables like stuns. It stacks duration. It also does more breakbar damage.
---
* Denial buffs soft CC like cripple. It stacks intensity and/or duration. It also does more breakbar damage.
---
Add a new debuff Mega-Weakness.
---
* Mega-Weakness reduces damage on enemies inflicted on and does not reduce endurance. It works on all mobs and bosses including those with a breakbar. Disables and Soft CC now also will inflict mega-weakness and Stability does not prevent mega-weakness. Unlike the regular weakness, it stacks intensity and it is tied to the Aggression and Denial stat. It could stack up to 50%-75% reduced damage. 
---
Weakness is unchanged or reduced a little bit because it doesn't affect bosses or mobs with breakbars. They are still useful to removing dodges.
---
What this means for PvE:
---
* I can now play looking like a warrior tank with my sword and shield. 
---
* To balance it out, pre-existing raid and fractal bosses do 0%, 25%, or 50% more damage. If ANet don't add more damage to bosses, Control role can be the substitute for healer role so that it would be 3 dps/1 boon/1 Control or Healer role as everyone can self-heal. 
---
What this means for sPvP and WvW:
---
* Toughness and Vitality is broken in sPvP. Tanking gear is removed for being too OP. By having Aggression, Denial and Weakness, you will hit like a wet noddle and you are glassy, but with skilled play, you make the other player hit like a wet noodle. 
---
* Not sure about WvW as I don't play that mode much but I assume it would be something similar to sPvP.
---
No problem. And thanks for the suggestion. Maybe I'll do that someday.
---
[Metabattle.com](https://Metabattle.com) for builds.
---
Exotic gear is fine for WvW, but you will want to work towards ascended eventually. Berserker gear may be okay for roaming, but it lacks the survivability required to last in large fights.
---
PvP does not require gear like WvW does. In PvP, you select the stats you want from the PvP panel, and everyone has balanced stats. Your gear stats don't effect your PvP stats.
---
I feel bad man I can't remember... It was like 2am lol. I'm sorry, but I will definitely dm you my username.
---
Nor do I expect that. I meant for them to be tougher so they can actually eat the little hits without needing to be so active. I'd expect a super attack from a boss to still kill them, jus as it would any other spec. 
---
My idea is that they sacrifice a lot of offense for a very diminished return on defense, which is why they aren't very useful. If you make them tougher, then the trade off is worth it.
---
Ultimately this is just my opinion and I'm sure there is somebody with a better game knowledge that has a better idea. But it would be cool to see defensive sets like the sword and board make an appearance in PvE.
---
Yeah, I've done several tests and narrowed the problem so far I'm certain it's a faulty GPU. I'll be spending my next week contacting the company for a varranty.

So everyone can have up tp 3, and we won't have to deal with bloated garbage.
---
What nomad mace firebrand that you mentioned as well as all "tanks" are missing is the ability to protect others. There is no aggro management in the game. The only that exist is because a raid boss is scripted to. No other bosses will target my tank. No amount of toughness and vitality will make my stuns and cripples protect my party harder. Thus making toughness and vitality a selfish and useless stat. 
---
A stat that helps me protect my party, that is what more I want.
---
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more unhelpful, nebulous response.
---
@ OP, since you don’t specify what game mode you want to play, [metabattle](metabattle.com)  is a good starting place to find good builds for all gamemodes.
---
I mean, at this point yes. Releasing a quarter-functioning API is just not good practice.
---
yea they can't protect others..except holding aggro, aegis, reflects, heals, sometimes other forms of damage mitigation
---
what more do you want? to take absolutely all the damage on their behalf so others can go afk?
---
a stat that protects party..like healing power and boon duration?
---
Ofc it is not like SC ever has trolled raids .. No no never.
---
I personally like that it's there, that's how I can usually tell that "I can only buy up to 5 per day", but tbh the text should be different. It doesn't really make sense, it's like it's trying to stop you from doing something wrong, while at most it should just be informing you that you can only buy 5 per day (even encouraging you to buy it would make more sense than trying to stop you) . Not that I care that much, it's just the text, but at some point someday they could change it.
---
How many topics do you want to create for this stupid request?

Are you saying this for the surface brandstone or the "standard" brandstone?
---
TBH when the map was released I did like 2-3 metas (plus a few quests in between while travelling/doing the skyscale quests), obviously gathered any mote I could see, then did 1 more meta and poof, I had a stack. It's pretty easy to get them, and the meta gives good rewards either way.
---
Sounds like a badly designed event.
---
Its not the players job to care about any of what you said. The event should be designed more intuitively.
---
Luckily, you're not forced to look at anyone's titles. They can easily be disabled and brought back up with a hotkey. You've yet to demonstrate I'm a hypocrite when my problem with infusions is that they're visually noisy, hurt performance, and are just outright ugly.
---
grats on the RNG luck... shame that what you got is still utterly underwhelming. just to dampen your joy a little bit: i'm pretty sure cele scourge is a bit outdated.
---
You're already replaced by a faceless pink blob for anyone with character models toned down, people are just asking for backpacks to get the same treatment, they won't see your full theme anyways.
---
If they enjoy the combat in GW2, they are gonna very much not like GW1's. Holy crap does it feel awful by comparison. At least, that's how I felt about it.
---
I give you points for actually giving a constructive comment, instead of just whining about how tanking would be boring. I dont quite think adding new stats is the way to go, just because they have everything needed in game already and it's a matter of changing how it all interacts with itself. But I do like where your heads at.
---
Oh, the 500th "let's break up BG" thread. Joy. Too bad this hasn't been covered before ad naseum.
---
Links are based on population and play time, and BG is linked because its population totals while linked are similar to the other servers. The reason BG wins every week is because its population is more spread out, and it has some very dedicated players who spend hours upon hours scouting important objectives. 
---
Removing the link will just mean that BG will have less prime-time players and the same off-hours coverage, so it won't solve the problem. It's the scoring model that is off. Points in off-hours scored by 5 havoc taking/holding objectives count just as much as a 60 person prime-time blob.
---
You can buy one per day from each vendor. Most of the LWS4 maps have 3-4 hearts. Most of the hearts let you buy 5 mats or 1 bundle of 5 mats. IIRC one map’s hearts has bundles with more than 5 mats (10 or 15 or something).
---
So most of LWS4 maps let you get 15-20 mats per day per char from the hearts. And usually two or three times if you do events.
---
Yeah, i loved gw1, but omg is it crappy when you go back to it now.
---
Motes are super easy to get for now. The others... not so much, unless you had them stockpiled. When those maps were new, the material nodes produced lots. Now, the material nodes produce 0 or 1, rarely 2.
---
Currently the best "traditional" MMO on the market is FFXIV and I've heard ESO is doing very well. That being said it's no 100% for sure thing you're gonna enjoy it as the game before 50 feels very slow.
---
Uh.. "September" is not "pretty soon".
---
Sure? But OP was asking for a game with similar combat to GW2. So, uh, yeah, kind of gonna compare the two when it's brought up as a suggestion for something they would enjoy.
---
Shockingly, sometimes things take time to fix!
---
Don’t forget our literal only PvE Legendary Backpack.
---
Basically, anything you can't buy off the tp: Obby shards, Mystic Crystals (or w/e), dungeon currency, and you might need to craft the gifts I don't remember.
---
Nothing really comparable IMO. I can't stick with any other MMO without becoming incredibly annoyed with stuff GW2 does so much better and I end up quitting them within a few weeks usually.
---
Gotta be weaver. Elementalist has been THE staple DPS class since the game came out, so you most likely don't have to worry about having the reroll something in the next expac.
---
As far as I know sword weaver is the highest DPS on large hitboxs, and its hella fun to.
---
#ele4lyfe
---
Ooh so recipes being down is why gw2efficiency can't give me the proper broken down crafting list for stuff like the gift of scales?
---
You shouldn't use efficiency for 2 handed 2nd gen legendaries. It's around 300g cheaper to craft 1 handed shards and convert them to desired 2 handed weapon.

---
Cries in Quip
---
ESO, PoE, Warfram2, Dauntless (atm) for me
---
As a person who likes wandering the open world to fight and doing large group events is BDO worth checking out?  I've checked out some new player guides here and there, but I've always been eventually put off because so much is locked behind tedious crafting /management menu "gameplay".  Come to think of it, GW2 is like that as well.

---
no surprise the rating isn't updated. power scourge has overtaken cele quite some time ago.
---
On the other hand, I use it significantly more than I thought I would. With the barrel roll it basically replaced jackal for me when trying to traverse a bumpy or uphill terrain not perfectly suitable for the raptor, and it mostly replaced the springer for me when going vertically—not only can it get higher and do so more easily, but it can also better combine vertical with horizontal movement when trying to get to a higher ledge that is also slighlty further ahead. I definitely wouldn't say it is subpar.
---
Yup, and there were very vocal people against adjusting points off-hours based on populations. I believe though, that Ray mentioned in one of the streams that when they look at scoring again, they would be balancing scores based on timezone populations. I think this is after Alliances.
---
Tera combat can feel really satisfying or really clunky depending on what you play. It's been a while, but I remember a lot of position-locking skills which cut into movement ability. The combat felt like a mix of WoW-style pacing and some GW2 reactionary elements.
---
Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen this. If I did it was too infrequent to make a connection that it was something to progress the heart.
---
I haven't played in a little over half a year, but last I played, it was pretty fun, but very grindy, you can probably find a pretty cheap key to try it out
---
in terms of open world PVP, it was pretty fun, but VERY gear dependent
---
run it as admin
---
You need to do this for the season 4 heart vendors that sell map currency as well, which is per character + per day. The season 3 ones just sold you a bundle of 5.
---
Try running it as adm. 
---
It's buggy as hell for me, my mouse is changing on windows automatically and i can't even get it back to normal sometimes, but i can't play gw2 without it.
---
Well it depends on what you call 'critical features' and if you count in things that are in the expansions but the closest I would go to calling something critical would be the copper fed salvage-o-matic. The game is so much less enjoyable without it imo that would put it under 'critical features'.
---
One of my favorite things about the game is random interactions like this!  My guildmates and I also love to run around as quaggans, or choya, and often find other players to join our little gang.  Thanks for sharing this!
---
It's definitely very badly optimized. My laptop that runs MHW very well has huge troubles with dauntless. Luckily I enjoy MHW a lot more anyway.
---
You need to leaf your puns out of here!
---
Nothing.
---
GW2 may have its flaws, but when you go to any other game, it's when all the tittle things shine. 
---
A ton of small annoyances pile up, and you end up fed up and come back to GW2.
---
I plan on doing all of LS4 in the next couple of days. Maybe that's my best option!
---
The only other way is to add aggro management.
---
Guild Wars 2 has none. You can make tanks as beefy as you. No amount of toughness, vitality, survivability is going to be ever useful if bosses don't care about it. 
---
Just making a control role instead of tank role is probably easier in terms of ANet having to rewrite the script of every AI mob just so that bosses looks at tanks.
---
&gt;except holding aggro, 
---
They don't.
---
&gt;aegis, reflects, heals, sometimes other forms of damage mitigation
---
Don't need toughness or vitality.
---
This is imo the best answer for OP.   
---
Try it.
---
We should talk about making green bl be desert and red bl be alpine.
---
&gt;what more do you want? to take absolutely all the damage on their behalf so others can go afk?
---
You can say that Healers absolutely heal all the damage on their behalf so others could go afk. 
---
&gt;a stat that protects party..like healing power and boon duration?
---
A CC stat that lowers enemy damage and buff CC duration.
---
Sorry. Despite the jokes of repair NPCs, all bears in Tyria refuse to wrestle. Their honor demands only duels to the death.
---
&gt; Its probably in the top 5 most played MMOs.
---
It's 24hr peak is 14k and unless something has change, BDO heavily incentives you to stay logged in 24/7.
---
It's safe to assume WoW, FFXIV, GW2, ESO and both versions of Runescape are pulling far superior numbers than BDO.
---
It doesn't matter anyway because if OP thinks a cosmetic house for 50 bucks is too much, He would think BDO was daylight robbery.
---
Boar bristle annoys me to no end because of this
---
I’ve already completed the bifrost stop dropping me an item who’s name I need to type in to delete
---
Also, players speeding past you and farming the nodes, chests and bosses you were going for.
---
Is there an easy way to acquire exotic Assassin's trinkets?
---
I wanted to build an open world Chrono, but Assassin trinkets are not even in the TP
---
Yeah, that's pretty much how I felt. Well, first it was a bit of confusion, but when I figured out what happened my general thought was "that's the most badass thing I've ever done in this game."
---
Okay.
---
Gather all the berry nodes in the top left corner of the map, switch chars and repeat.
---
This is why I swapped to FFXIV.
---
It's API.
---
It's a hard truth. But that's why I tried the angle of adding something else to the formula instead if changing it too much. That way if you're looking for hard deeps and a worn down dodge button, you can still have that. But apparently adding a different way to achieve the same goal cheapens the experience somehow.
---
Nevertheless, it would serve this game well to add some diversity in its roles. Make fights about more than just dodgeable mechanics and l33t seeps. Even if it's just adding more opportunities for support roles.
---
Have to buy another bank tab? WAI.
---
I’ll be hopping on Phantasy Star On-Line 2 as soon as it drops. Hoping we get a native port for Switch as well (Japan only got a streaming version).
---
Standard models bruh. It’s better for your gameplay anyway
---
Coming soon: Rainbow Caterpillar infusion.
---
&gt; there are entire specs not being used  
---
there is not a single spec not used in pve.
---
Path of Exile is really good if you can tolerate getting into an aRPG.  It definitely helps to use build-guides until you've got your feet firmly planted on the ground, but I don't think it takes much away from the game because the builds in the game are so diverse.  Your skill system works sort of like materia in Final Fantasy VII; you equip it via sockets, and then link it to support gems.  Support gems add an extra layer of really deep, thoughtful and inventive play to the game.  I'd suggest just searching, "3.7 League Starters," on YouTube and taking a look at some of the builds you can put together.
---
Not an mmo but check out Monster Hunter: World.
---
FFXIV still works this way.
