i actually had some fun in Grothmar, and it took a bit longer, but fully map completing and doing story for this one, was like...an hour
---
---
---
boo
---
Yeah with that spec in particular the unique should have been to not get new right side skills instead.
---
tldr. People will complain about literally anything.
---
I think Laranthir will be the leader of the Vigil overall, and that Jhavi is the leader of that particular detachment in the Shiverpeaks.
---
 The worst episode I've ever played by far. It made me feel bad and worried about the future of the game
---
That has been clear ever since they started fully automating festivals, and adding 20 year achiev caps.
---
&gt; something to do with WvW
---

---
That something, they have been talking about for like over 2 years now. Still nowhere to be seen.
---
1. Couldn't talk to any of the NPCs with chat bubble icons over their heads after regrouping inside Jora's Keep. Clicking on them accomplished nothing, exiting through the door just removed the icons, preventing me from even trying futher. I did read Snargle's book in the corner of the room before attempting to talk to NPCs, might've bugged out because of that.
---
2. A bunch of players had trouble entering raven's sanctum. Right raven statue was either uninteractive, or had a weird hitbox that was barely clickable, or always showed a grayed out cursor. The NPC conversation seems to have been left unfinished, maybe that was the problem. I went to charselect and back, NPCs vanished but the conversation restarted (at full volume, due to the client being unable to find NPC agents to play the sounds at their position), and lasted for a few more lines that on the previous attempt. After the final line I somehow managed to get the instance portal to appear.
---
It's SHIT. Here, constructive criticism from a veteran supporting growth of franchise from times of GW1 beta. -.- Anet, suck on a wet end of it! It's frustrating! How episode 1 can be SHORTER and more BLANK than a prologue??? Masteries are here just to slightly fetch your rewards and unlock story progress. Voices are displaced, paranoia effect made me LMFAO, that's how poorly made it was. And meta event......?! Pre event is a reskinned and multiplied Bloodstone Fen white mantle event. Do you think people are that stupid Anet, huh? And what comes after that? So hyped boss died on 1/4 of its predefined path, without slowing him down (mechanics skip yaay). Enemies drop like flies too without those silly manipulations. Fuck.. I am ready to assume that this extra time for "adjustments" was just an excuse to finish up programming this turd. After story part I was wandering around the map guessing "where are the people? Map was full 20 minutes ago..", people were so neglectful in /s that they refused to speak. Whole place felt like a fucking GRAVEYARD. 
---
Maybe tommorow it will be better. Maybe they just forgot to ship 2nd half of the episode and features? Bunch of fucking clowns. Anet- I officially hate you for what you did.
---
&gt; Their revenues, like the game, have been stable, which is a very good thing.
---
No, they haven't. They've been stagnating. The revenue has been slowly edging downwards.
---
&gt;Nope. They've always struggled to keep population numbers up on those modes. Most people that did play them were only there for some short term required goal, and resented having to be there.
---
The ERP event that happened a few months ago showed there is massive intrest in raids.  So, you're objectively wrong here.
---
&gt;They are faster than they were at their slowest, like after HoT launched.
---
Get your facts straight. After hot launched there was no plan which is why living world took so long. 
---
&gt;You seem to have zero understanding about what makes up this game if you believe that statement to be accurate. It's like if McDonalds removed the McRib from their menu, and you started whining "suddenly they removed 90% of their menu, shouldn't everything else be better now?!"
---
If your game only does a single thing, then it should do that single thing well. 
---
If mcdonalds removed every single thing from their menu except the mcrib, and the mcrib they served tasted like shit, then why wouldn't you complain?
---
If anet wants gw2 to be a singleplayer story focused game, why is the singleplayer campaign so shitty and slow to develop?
---
They're doing one thing and they're fucking it up.
---
&gt;Where do you believe they went?
---
Hookers and cocaine.
---
&gt;You can complete any PvP map in 15 minutes.
---
or less.
---
Nope sorry. A PvP map is populated by players who behave differently every time. You cannot "complete" a pvp map in the same way you complete a campaign map.
---
&gt;Look, the content wasn't junk "because I said so," it was junk because most players said so. 
---
The ERP event shows that you're demonstrably wrong.
---
&gt;And, again, that has never been how ANet operated. They never announce anything more than one release away, more than "when it's ready to ship."
---
A.) Not an excuse.
---
B.) We have no reason to believe the saga will be any different from lws5.
---
&gt;Not necessarily. 
---
If your game is shit then no, not necessarily, if you're actually following players then yes it absolutely should increase revenue, look at shit like warframe, path of exile and destiny.
---
&gt;This was my point, raids drove people away from the game.
---
Objectively wrong, look at the ERP event and how massive it was.
---
Yeah guys don't burn through the 1 hour of story content to quickly.
---
So apparently if you bought the previous one the new one is bugged.  Wonderful.
---
looks super fire
---
This thread is basically people going "you mean I have to PLAY the actual content? what kind of joke is this?"
---
But not yellow snow!
---
Pretty much the same as last few maps. What about a IBS tome? We got two portal scrolls now.
---
Oh I'd completely missed the fort part if that's so, or taken it in a more metaphorical way. But still, is she talking about that specific fort as in Jora's Keep? It sounds a bit strange as she is a leader of the Vigil, not of just one fort. 
---
It never seemed to be the way the other leaders operate, and it opens the matter of whose place she would've been taking - it couldn't have been Almorra, as she definitely wasn't spending most of her time at Jora's Keep. 
---
I guess it could have been that Almorra was taking command of Jora's now because of the recent events and would have handed it down to her in the future. 
---
I was hoping maybe something in the strike missions or somewhere else had been said to explain things a bit better....
---
&gt; People seem to enjoy PvP. Just not many of them, and that's the quagan assholeiest of all.
---
ERP event demonstrated that there is a very very big intrest in raids.
---
&gt;Nothing was undermined about Blish's sacrifice.
---
No, but everything was undermined about the very concept of sacrifice when the ultimate sacrifice was undone. 
---
&gt;Bloodstone Gliding was in Lake Doric, 
---
Oh gee whiz! A whole TWO maps&gt; Damn, anet is so generous!
---
Actually nevermind, its not actually two maps, its one map and about a tenth of another map, because you only use it after riding the single leyline from the first waypoint.
---
&gt;It was an interesting addition to GW2 maps though, presenting an object that you could maneuver to collect using the newly added gliding and later flying mounts. It's not overly original to gaming in general, but it was a fun new feature for GW2.
---
Why does it require you to unlock an entire mastery to do it?
---
&gt;Yes, one of. And I also highlighted in that article how they went on to point out that it would be far from the last.
---
Yes and the other was templates and we saw how well that turned out didn't we?
---
I really wanted someone to make a killer meme with the clown getting dressed up template :&lt;
---
The change must have been done based on their metrics.
---
They may want to see whether people stop using the raptor.
---
Who cares about lore for a dying mmo. If you only want good lore there are plenty of games out there that does it way better than gw2. Only thing that the game has going for it is the superior combat, and they don't even make proper use of it... sad
---
Icebrood Saga is
---
Expansion worthy content.
---
Haha, just kidding.
---
"cant recommend anyone else making the investment that ive made. not right now. not with this little communication on the actual future of the game.cant recommend anyone else making the investment that ive made. not right now. not with this little communication on the actual future of the game."
---
ok bye.
---
if u'd entered in game today the new map was so full u wold not belive. but hey game is nearly dead isn't it ? 
---
oh new map is amazing
---
[removed]
---
The way theyve handled masteries is interesting, theres a choice to be made for which attunement. Also if you want more youll have do the achievments. The Achievments are all tiered too, offering an incentive to progress to the harder parts. Theres no heart vendors, and you have to play content to unlock things.   There is also no volatile magic nonsense. Returning of a lot of older masteries . The open world parts of the story flowed nicely and the client side phasing has stepped up a notch with allied NPCs fighting alongside you.
---
Tried re-starting the game and leaving the area. Next step would be to restart the story but not doing that shit all over again. gg
---
Didn’t see in notes so thank you! That’s pretty odd change not that I complain about it.
---
"Cool. Actual content would be great" they said obliviously, while looking at the launcher which is patching actual content.
---
Hahaha omg you dont get emotional, abet wont appreciate your chivaley anyway, doll
---
Can I get a source for that...?
---
Because it's usually that bad. 
---
Remember Foot Key?
---
They said in the guild chat this past week you would need it to get loot from the strikes
---
Because developers are branding LS5 as a turning point for GW2. 
---
It raises player morale to give them a new coat of paint every time they open the game.
---
I really love the cool blue of the new launcher, and I'd love to see that represented in the character select.
---
I believe if we ask reeeeally nicely, and be PMA about it, the devs will consider the change.
---
Assnet will always be trash.
---
Lol it's kind of ironic timing to say that the day of a new content update, in a thread about the new launcher design...
---
you should have finished reading the post. map is great, cool mechanics. story is great. i did a boss, found some lore, none of it explained aberrant or fallen creatures. what are those. for a team the size of 150+.
---
in this case, "ok bye" is the equivalent of saying youre ok with the game being on its last legs, as long as everyone shuts up about it so they dont disturb you.
---
The new episode literally came out today...
---
Whoa, character who had her story / life goal completed end of last season died unexpectedly for no good reason when new season starts... how cliché-ed is that?
---
Let's hope Laranthir somehow  shows up during this season to take the Vigil's mantle.
---
Aww well I'm sure the community will miss you someone tell Anet to just close the whole thing down because of this guy.
---
I don't even like the story. I actually regret all the time I invested into this game (very little money though, thank god). If I knew it would peter out like this, I never would have bought it to begin with back in 2012. It started out with so much promise. The expansions with the elite specs were really well done. But everything else they've done has been straight poop.
---
They can't figure out what they want this game to be. After seven years, they still don't know.
---
Same, and the last server restart didn't fix it.
---
The new map has a vendor exchange for 25 eternal ice + karma -&gt; 10 of any S4 map material
---
Same here
---
They'll probably release a new legendary trinket after season 5 too, so better not use that currency...
---
Which took a little over an hour to complete and the Bjora Marches is pretty sad. Not sure what I expected, but it for sure was "content."
---
To be fair, when else would they have changed it? We've still been mostly in the desert region for the last season until Bound By Blood, and that was a prologue that wasn't in the far Shiverpeaks yet, so it would have been kinda weird to change the launcher just for that only to change it again right now for the first actual episode.
---
Hello,
---
I am working on them right now. There is first guide next are coming asap.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW-8wHfBKtA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW-8wHfBKtA)
---
I am really not sure if it is maegarine yet.
---
Oh lel, thanks.
---
The worst thing for me is that you can't just choose easy ones and end up with 10-12 chests in 15 mins. Now if you want to actually farm S3 dailies, you have to do the time consuming ones too because of how limited the choice is. Which is very annoying.
---
No way I'm waiting for Justiciar to spawn in BSF.
---
o_O
---
Is this the boss chest or some sort of bonus chest?
---
How dare you enjoy free content?! Don't you know that you're supposed to be pissed off about that right now? You're supposed to be whining that the content that you aren't paying for isn't good enough!
---
have you unlocked t4 fotm lfg and heared of CMs maybe?
---
Yeah, it just launched today!
---
Good rebuttal
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Stop crying on this forum, you've been here long enough, got enough downvotes for being an actual moron
---
Suck it up and talk to your mommy 
---
Seek help
---
It was interesting how Commander took a pause before replying to Braham, like we aren't certain about what was Jormag saying is totally wrong. I'm all intrigued for what's coming next O: So I did a little sketch, I guess that is also to create a post for a little discussion.   
---
Also was thinking about how the voice was slowly changing to the real one that Jormag has...  
---
(I don't draw comics, so that's like a one time thing, maybe I'll be doing stuff like that again)
---
Could  Asgeir's Amulet  be the precursor for a legendary Amulet?
---
They've managed to make this release even shorter than the others.
---
Okay, doll :)
---
I’ve sadly gotten sucked back into wow again. But it works out because I can play these short story episodes and have something else to keep me interested after. That seems to be what they want. I kind of lost hope even before we found out fractals were pretty much done. They just keep inventing systems and never sticking with them or investing anything in them. The mounts are cool but this mastery system sounds redundant and like a great way of creating shallow replayability. I’ve heard the map is really small but I’ll still enjoy exploring whatever it has for a few days.
---
But they can change the launcher easy anytime lol. That's hardly something they needed to plan far ahead.
---
Boss chest.
---
I had Rytlock and Crecia standing on each wing. For a minute thought it meant something...
---
When were we ever promised more legendary weapons? we weren't.
---
Raid and fractal releases aren't tied with saga releases. They've said this.
---
Episode 1 of the "saga" was not only shorter in story with a smaller map than most living world episodes, it was shorter than the bleeding prologue.
---
And it didn't even come with a fractal, raid or legendary.
---
Like, I'm not even dissapointed, I'm just surprised, where is all the money going in? Where are all these employs doing? Surely, they've cut back on raids, fractals, pvp and wvw so they can focus on ~~living world~~, ahem, sorry, I mean SAGAs. 
---
So, why is the saga so subpar?
---
Well people complained about an hour or two of story and a map every four months so now we get half a map and half the story every two. Lol
---
https://ibb.co/g4CK0bW Got it!
---
Raids and fractal got table'd.
---
You mean stream that 200 people watched?
---
Most likely... at the end of the season, when the saga is complete... like all other living world seasons when they are put together...
---
The only thing I can think of is that this is the final season and they don’t know how many episodes it will have, so they can just keep expanding it however long they want without having to partition it into a new season.
---
So... I got diabetes seeing that. But I like it.
---
What is there to play? More mindless events where you spam buttons at big baddy and get generic loot like in every other map in the game?
---
i'm perfectly ok with the game as it is now. and no it's not on its last legs. that's the reason of the ok bye. it's the 100000000 thread with the same stuff. aren't you all bored ?
---
So far the saga is as pathetic as the announcement for it. What people expected? Good things after lay offs?
---
"Expansion-worthy content" is on a fast track to become the next big meme after the "2 hour content every 3 months" one.
---
Hey guys, I know it's crazy but I'm starting to think that "the table" doesn't actually exist.
---
What's the problem, exactly? They released three sets and took down one of them because it was racial armor. The other two can still be bought from time to time and they released a new light armor set to replace the racial one. I don't think they are trying to hide that, otherwise they would have stopped selling them.
---
Also, there have been multiple "reimagined" armor sets and also weapon skins added to the game to be obtained via in-game methods. See: Royal Ascalonian Flame weapons, shiny skritt weapons, the ghost sword (not sure about the name), a transparent version for each gen1 legendary precursor, the halloween armor sets. 
---
So I don't think it's fair to call anet out for making a cash-grab by "re-releasing" skins through the gem store, especially considering how this weapon doesn't even look like Astralaria in the first place, IMO.
---
You mean the stream that everyone doesn't watch? That stream?
---
Oh, please go ahead. I genuinely wish to know your thoughts on the matter. What could possibly be so foolish about assuming that on average 200 kp groups will perform more smoothly than 50 kp groups, Mr. r/iamverysmart ? Hahaha
---
Maps were full on Wildstar at reset too.....
---
What happened? The map is smaller so content should be more packed with story. Where is it?
---
You got a map and some story didn't you? Well there you go!
---
Ok Marcia
---
From a simpler time. A cherished memory.
---
Well that was an ok 30 minutes of story.
---
See you in 4 months guy!=s!
---
U put time and money. It is your choice. They do not have to follow your instructions for your ideal game. This is their game and their design. What do you know about the full potential . It is working well and it found a niche in the market : old gamers with less time . It is perfect to me
---
 All these changes I keep in reading to make this better because random reasons would just ruin the game like they dsaigned
---
See you in 4 months guy!
---
"Vaporware"
---
See you in 4 months guys!
---
Characters die, it happens. But that felt really....flat. Especially for an established badass like her. And she deserved a cutscene or something at least, for sure.
---
You've summarized it nicely, I have very similar opinion. I just wish that we could get more hard map-wide metas, that require more organization than just running behind a commander.
---
I think we all need to accept that the game is dying now. (Not in terms of the player base, but content-wise) 7 years was a good run.
---
Ehh, it pains me that if they followed living world - expansion - living world - expansion schedule I'd be doing hero points unlocking my third elite specialization and exping to level new cool masteries. Sadly it's clear that gw2 is not their main focus anymore so let's enjoy the saga while it lasts.
---
Season 1 was definitely butter though :O
---
800 Gems coming soon(tm)
---
a night time winter option is ideal
---
No new hairstyles is a crock of shit and honestly I'm getting tired of how mediocre these people have grown as a studio.
---
&gt; What's the problem, exactly?
---
Laziness.
---
You're right. You should go play a different game.
---
Bugged for me as well, while my friend can buy it without issues.
---
Its good content, just far and few between.
---
Jormag is probably trying to play the devil we know card against the devil we don't know in the unending ocean.
---
You get them from the mastery tier 2 chests.
---
So, episode 1 of the "saga" just came out. 
---
Its not only shorter than most (if not all) episodes of living world story wise, including the PROLOGUE chapter of the saga, the map is also smaller and there's no fractal, raid, legendary collection or balance change/pass release to accompany it.
---
Good to see that "expansion worthy content" that everything else was sacrificed for is finally being deployed!
---
&gt; This is expected. 
---
Story being on the short side is not to be expected. Less maps is a good thing, story being shortened is amongst the worst.
---
Gw2 has players who think that running around a map pressing F is the be-all-end-all. When you set the bar so low nothing will dissapoint you.
---
Good to know, thanks!  I just got my first tier 2 mastery, but didn't find any chests to open with it yet.
---
I went in there and got the chests mailed to me at daily reset
---
In the beginning you had both, the party owner could kill an entire instance if they didn't realize they weren't the instance owner as well. Happened to me a couple times as they tried to make room for friends at the final fight of a dungeon to having 3-4 people spamming me about being a troll and a douche and other more profane words as I took instance owner and that was to be only had by the party leader. Then we took away party leaders to fix that issue and left instance owners around for a bit longer as they couldn't figure the fix out for that as easily and that wonderful vote system was put in place...
---
[Heres something for you to get emotional over ;\]](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/92471/developer-handles-on-the-guild-wars-2-forums)
---
dont let the downvotes and comments pointing out that you're an idiot dissuade you
---
You got a lot more growing up and the world will openly embrace you once you've got your wittle head checked :)
---
Keep at it
---
Didn't ANet say that they wanted to "stray away from the elder dragons a bit"?
---
Probably hinting at something related to the mists, or otherworldly?
---
&gt; Just stop lying to your playerbase and be honest about the direction of the game and let those people leave the game in peace.
---
As a WvW player I would actually be happy with this.
---
What does clicking it do?
---
Yes, please!
---
Sure you can say that about the skins I mentioned but since we're still on the post about the new axe, please do tell me how that is lazy in any way. For all I know there is nothing on it that's being reused from Astralaria besides the "theme". 
---
The skin itself looks very neatly designed with great details, nice animations and a great overall design. There's nothing lazy about it. I don't have Astralaria but if I did I'd be hyped to run this in my off-hand together with Astralaria on dual-axe builds.
---
There is a new expansion-worthy axe skin - a rare drop from lootboxes.
---
I do, the decline in swtor and associated content creators after they did much the same thing.
---
can't get past the poison part in raven's sanctum
---
take my upvote
---
You are *not* a stick.
---
Same, had to restart the mission.
---
I liked the Choya Pinata. 
---
Gw2 is not exclusively story and map metas ya know.
---
Gorrik is part of the team for this season, along with Jory, Kasm Braham and Rytlock, so, yeah... there's going to be a constant Inquest presence.
---
And the German interview pretty much confirmed neither fractals nor raids are in the works
---
This is some very cool content, love seeing other people's commanders. I'd upvote more!
---
Not only is it shorter than most (if not all) episodes of living world story wise, including the PROLOGUE chapter of the saga, the map is also smaller and there's no fractal, raid, legendary collection or balance change/pass release to accompany it. Hell, there's not even a unique mechanic like sun's refuge to accompany the release.
---
dhuum 3: revenge of the orbs
---
Aside from the mastery chests, you can get some from the raven sanctuary where you fought the norn in story. There are chests there that reset every day.
---
They should probably just give us the option which Backround we want.
---
I absolutely dont want a bright white/blue backround and very much prefer the dark mode Elona one we have right now.
---
Adding an option to pick one would be the obvious solution.
---
Say what
---
I agree, this is a bad change.  I like farming mistborn motes on Dragonfall and this change is a harsh nerf for that, since a lot of the motes (used to) come from the dailies.  Also means I'm not contributing to the meta while I'm there due to the now missing eventful daily.  
---
My guess is that its just crowd control and they want to concentrate everyone in the new content.  I just logged off early instead ^_^
---
You missunderstood me, people, we are talking about freaking picture here, mere logo and you are all Woooaahhh, so amazing, while gazilion things in game are not getting reworked, fixed etc. Point is that game gives so little of new stuff that people get excited over some simple picture on login screen.
---
i am sad to see almorra go and if im being honest i really dont see how it is supposed to affect the story. i was confused though, didnt logan thackery take over the pact? i forget what soulkeeper was in charge of other than joras keep, which itself is something i only learned about in this episode. kinda reminds me of how belinda came and went, but soulkeeper deffinitely had more presence in the story. she was just a really solid, likeable side character that never got in the way for stupid reasons. i think she was used very effectively in the story, and putting together the end cutscene with her radio call to us in the beginning was actually chilling. very sinister move on jormags part, though i am curious how the writing will set up the reason for doing that to us and then saying hey btw you'll need my help eventually so i'll be chillin til then and doin what i do. i will miss soulkeeper indeed.
---
Hey guy I know it's
---
crazy but I'm starting to
---
think that the tabledoesn'tactuallyexist
---
Good write up. As for me, for what it is worth (GW2) over the last 7 years, it's value for money. The ration between the amount of money I spent vs the time it took to finally let go of the game is awesome. Otherwise, this game has set its course to a certain path (death?) and it will get there eventually.
---
&gt; ERP event demonstrated that there is a very very big intrest in raids.
---
I don't know what that is, but no, there is not. Only a tiny fraction of the players in this game have done any raiding whatsoever. It is a non-factor.
---
&gt;No, but everything was undermined about the very concept of sacrifice when the ultimate sacrifice was undone. 
---
I have no idea what you're talking about, Blish is still dead.
---
&gt;Why does it require you to unlock an entire mastery to do what super mario has been doing by default since the 90s?
---
Since when is "unlocking a mastery" some crippling burden? I unlocked three this afternoon. Like I said, it's not remotely revolutionary overall, almost nothing is these days, but it was new to *this* game, and added a little spark to the newer maps, a little something extra to entertain. Would I recommend this game to others, entirely on the basis that you can chase Unbound Magic orbs? Of course not, but I still see it as a net positive, and worth taking note of.
---
&gt;Yes and the other was templates and we saw how well that turned out didn't we?
---
We have yet to see all the features that this season will bring.
---
How is this map any different from the other sesaon 4 maps?
---
this happens almost every time they add a new story episode and they still haven't learned to check for this bug before releasing
---
What an epically beautiful time and scenery depth
---
Can we talk about what a let down the boneskinner is? What does he even do? He is just there when then event pops up, there is a breakbar that someone replenishes itself right before breaking and then he is dead.
---
Almorra founded the Vigil. She's overall got quite a bit of story presence, even out of the game: there's a novel Ghosts of Ascalon which you should definitely check out if you like the lore.
---
I doubt they'll never do fractals or raids again, but tbh it's possible they may get dropped like dungeons did, which is silly really.
---
The Episode in its entirety seems to be a lot shorter than the prologue.
---
Which they won't since they already mentioned the way they want to release these things.
---
&gt;Again, I don't feel like passing judgement on this "saga" until we see the full scope of it.
---
Anet held a presentation that was dissapointing. "There's more!" Cried out the white knights. "You're too early to judge!" They defended. So, we waited.
---
The prologue came and it was mediocre. "There's more!" Cried out the white knights. "You're too early to judge!" They defended. So, we waited yet again.
---
The templates came and they were a disaster. "There's more!" Cried out the white knights. "You're too early to judge!" They defended. So, once more, we waited.
---
Now episode 1 is out and its beyond joke tier. "There's more!" Cried out the white knights. "You're too early to judge!" They defended.
---
You ever hear what the definition of insanity is?
---
&gt; I just completed the story component of the patch, and I enjoyed what I played. 
---
All 30 minutes of it I hope.
---
&gt;And fractals and raids are completely irrelevant to anything.
---
The fact that they spend less time developing raids and fractals means that they should spend more resources/time on actual story and map. 
---
Except while there is no raid or fractal or legendary), the story is the shortest in any episode they've ever released, the map is tiny and there's no new mechanics like sun's refuge. 
---
So, where are all the time and resources going?
---
&gt;where is all the money going in?
---
Straight into their pockets since it should be obvious at this point that they don't care about using it for the game.
---
Is this the new strike?
---
yes, the other tabs are for the tier 1 weapons, the tier 2 weapons, and the season 4 currencies. i still looked through the contents, though, in case they misplaced the nodes, but nope.
---
also, my friend told me its there on the 1st tab of the karma vendor at the waypoint
---
&gt;I don't know what ERP is
---
Ah, so essentially you admit that you are speaking out your ass and had no idea what you're talking about.
---
Congratuations on invalidating literally everything you've been saying this entire time!
---
You could have said that from the start, I was already suspecting you were just a random fanboy that ignored reality, but this pretty much confirms it.
---
Look up the elitist raid party event that happened a few months ago and how massive of a deal that was, and try wiping the egg off your face while you're at it.
---
Menzies?
---
There were definitely some fun moments towards the end like you say, but Season 1 had about 20+ mini updates. Spread over 2 years in which the game managed to lose a huge amount of its initial core audience thanks to no depth, progression, or replayability in the content. Lore and story wise it was also completely all over the place until the final patches with some of the worst character building going.
---
They started to bring it back around with Season 2 and finally with HoT, but by that point it was too little too late for a lot of people.
---
No, there is one boneskinner in the map.
---
I think Almorra never had anything to do with Logan, he got the Pact leader position from us, the commander, as we're now "retired" and moving on to other things.
---
As about the replacement.. Most likely [Laranthir](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Laranthir_of_the_Wild), if Anet still acknowledges his existance. *"I am a Grand Warmaster, Almorra's second-in-command. Should she fall, I will lead the order...but I pray to the Tree I am never needed in that role." ...Damn this hurts :'D
---
&gt;and not randomly giving in to stupid things the way horror movies do just to keep the plot moving
---
I know right?! This's so, so depressing to me. Like, the writers didn't even care who she was. Part of me is still in denial and hopes her death was a Jormag illusion/manipulation of some kind..
---
Then that would be where I got the ten I had to upgrade one of them.  I did buy two of the weapons.
---
When I've got all my masteries topped off, I'll head back in and start grabbing the other sources!
---
Thanks, that's really helpful.  So for Elementalists, it's still Power Precision and Ferocity to maximize damage even though they aren't melee, got it.  (Are there Elementalist builds that use condition damage instead?)
---
The wiki is 99,9% written by players. The patch released a couple hours ago, people need time to play it, then afterwards whenever they feel like, write the articles for the hundreds of new stuff
---
ok so I managed to get my old account back, does that means I have access to the expansions? how do I know I have it?
---
yeah you're right it was us that handed it to her. i would actually LOVE to see laranthir take the pact. General Laranthir has a great ring to it
---
Do i get the rewards only on the accounts I created? I dont want to use any of those races now :/
---
&gt; But come LW S3 
---
I'll direct you to the fact that part of your sentence has a 3 on it, which implies there's 2 entire seasons of information that you never checked plus an entire expansion in HoT that explains even more.
---
Awesome, thanks for the explanations!
---
The new launcher is being praised a lot though.
---
See? Just look at the datamine. Fraenir, Boneskinner, and the two Kodan. It's listen right there.
---
INFO OP: have you played season 2 and HoT?
---
Season 1 isn't available anymore but there's a bit on YouTube people usually link to for a catch up. I'll see if I can find it.
---
Talk about a band-aid solution. Rather than add a recipe to make it or increase the drop rate; just take 3 off the total required. I've still not seen a shoulder box never mind the helm.
---
Has anyone found the 1st valor essence chest?
---
"Haha, pranked!"
---
-Anet
---
And short. Don't forget short.
---
thanks, updated
---
I think I did LW S2. It involves Dry Top and the lead-up to HoT, right?  
---
I totally missed out on LW S1 and the in-game recap is quite lacking in the specifics. I want to check up the actual S1 Playthrough on Youtube.
---
Well it's half the length of a standard LS episode which seems reasonable if they release the next episode in two months.
---
I am pretty sure I have played S2; it was confusing, but as I noted in my OP, I expected that. What I didn't expect I guess what having those characters be constants going forward.   
---
\&gt;&gt;  Expecting a continuing story to contain all the information you need to know who every character is isn't really realistic...or reasonable.  
---
I respectfully disagree. TV shows, sequels, games and even books find artistic and effective ways to recap events all the time. Not sure what you're basing your expectations off of since it literally happens constantly across multiple media channels and story formats.
---
Yep except they did commit to expansion level content and so far we've received none of that.
---
The items are account bound so you can share them between characters if you want to. They are mostly things like the unlocks, miniatures, boosters etc. And sometimes nice items too.
---
There are achievements that include 28 and 32 slot bags again.  It doesn't look like it'll be as interesting to get as the Sandswept ones were, but bags are bags.
---
Yeah, this one was like an hour, I understand they can't all be like "A Star to Guide Us" but come on.
---
You cannot use that option while you're listed in the LFG though, even as a squad.
---
This has aged nicely
---
I think he wants the tome, not the scroll, which i haven't seen in game yet. I know its only 2 items so far but i would still like an item to consolidate the scrolls for the new season.
---
Well said. Season 1 was an interesting concept poorly executed, at best.
---
Thats gw1? Bloody cow! That looks way better than ours...
---
Account wide or 1 char lock?
---
Depends on what they plan on adding later on since it's still early.
---
I am a stick.
---
&gt;i think the writing and dialogue is way too bad so i don't even have fun. 
---
All it took for me was to start playing through FFXIV's storyline post ARR for me to realise what I've been missing out on with storywriting and dialogue. Best in the industry. GW2? Well... pretty lacking because of the focus on these elder dragons. I like the lore of this game but it's delivered horribly imo.
---
Agreed.
---
The point of her death is that there are too many characters.
---
I didn't think you could
---
&gt; Your content is in another game!
---
As someone who has no clue what this is, what is it?
---
Bags are rewards for doing the content.
---
I've beaten the story ...still can't buy a TOME to out other scrolls in
---
I feel like this marks the point of no more expansions, as these launchers will prob be going with LWS arcs going ahead.  Oh well
---
There are years of evidence that this kind of posts don't work either but somehow someone is always posting them ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Standard bug in new episodes. Itll appear when they fix it
---
My top theory is that they thought there would be a new game after season 4. The ncsoft restructure shut that down and they have put this saga together only in the time since that restructure, and they are still ramping up the teams to their long-term cadence.
---
The comments in that thread are pretty mixed, with people still finding something to complain about.
---
You've played the game for SEVEN years and it's not worth it just NOW!?
---
Why can't people move on from something they clearly enjoy peacefully? Why is it always overdramatic nonsense?
---
[All I could think of](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0aRtupiY9Dw)
---
Holy! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
---
It might be this one: https://youtu.be/I5BRzMoIEOA
---
I recall there being one that was around 30 mins or so. There's quite a few vids on YouTube so I don't remember now which is the one I had in mind. There is one thats over 3 hours. It will certainly get you caught up but is quite a commitment to watch through 
---
You're right season 2 is the lead up to HoT.
---
I recommend d you pur base PoF as it now comes with Hot bundled in. Watch this lw1 season recap then play through from season 2 o wards. HoT  is good and the game gets stronger from there
---
I'm not saying I don't want a new one. Just, realistically, it's not that BIG of a deal considering just how little time we spend on either screen.
---
It's more of a placebo effect... or something. It would make us feel like something big happened because those things only change when you get expansions.
---
Literally a bug in the system
---
Yeah, def.
---
Yeah, I mean... this feels very unfinished to me. Here are my issues so far:
---
\-The stupid cheap horror movie plot. Oh, the whispers made you do it? Sure, that hasn't been done like a million times or anything. I don't even like horror and even I know what a cliche that is.
---
\-The chopper in Black Citadel is bugging out for people, and some of the Pact's lines are literally not playing, like someone forgot to code in the cue for them. (i.e. Marjorie says a line, then only text shows, then says a line, then no sound again).
---
\-The VA for the "voice" is... okay? I guess? But I also kind of feel like you could stick his lines to an Enya song and not tell the difference. Again, I loathe horror and I'm easily scared, but this wasn't scary. I eyerolled when he first started talking. (No offense to Enya fans)
---
\-The map with ONE TELEPORT POINT. Ugh, no. Even smaller maps have 2-3, good grief.
---
\-Story missions are weirdly short. I actually wouldn't mind this, given how teeth-grindingly annoying it is to have a sudden DC in the middle of a long segment and have to start over, but people are saying the entire chapter is short, not just the bits making it up. (Like a chapter with say, 15 short parts instead of 5 long ones would be fine by me).
---
\-I'm hoping this is just because of the whole server trying to play it, but the new map is lagging so badly I actually had to set my game to potato mode. I never have to do that, even for events like Tequatl, and this is just me trying to run through a map, not major fights or anything. I had zero issues with the prologue map, it ran fine. I feel like they optimized something poorly or rushed it.
---
\-The unlocking of mastery points feels a bit odd this time around. I mean, I don't want to go back to the days of 12 mastery points just to unlock Nuoch stuff, but POF felt pretty balanced with the amount of points sprinkled around and how many it took to unlock them. One a piece for the first two feel weirdly anticlimactic.
---
\-People have mentioned the bonfires/blizzards not working, I've also had this issue.
---
\-While I'm happy to see things like bounce mushrooms and updrafts get reused, the bounce mushrooms are still very prone to lag-smacking you into the ground and killing you at random.
---
And just a general note not specifically related to the episode - this thing now where outfit packs include utility items and other things purely so they can list the new sales first on LITERALLY EVERY TAB of the gemstore is super annoying. If I want to buy an outfit, I'll click that tab Anet, please stop spamming it in all the other categories. This sudden spike in aggressiveness with the monetization is actually making me leery of putting more money in the game. I mean, I like the game, I'm happy to drop cash on things I want, but this makes me feel like they're desperate to cash in before the game dies and I don't really want to keep dropping money in the cash shop if the game is going to fold within the year. (I really hope I'm just being paranoid, because I love this damn game man, it's my favorite MMO).
---
I dunno. I loved the prologue, thought it was fantastic, but this is leaving me very "meh" so far. :/ And I had zero expectations because I avoided trailers/spoilers/etc.
---
It's in the canyon before you cross the bridge into the loot/champ section
---
The commander definately paused and wasn't entirely sure with that final "right" in my opinion.
---
I can honestly see it being both ways. Jormag is lying to us, or Jormag is telling the truth. Combine with the implications that the Norn survived because Jormag purposefully let Asgeir take the tooth and lead the norn south alongside the spirits of the wild...
---
How do you do it?
---
Awesome!
---
While i get what you're saying, sometimes it takes an eye opening moment to make you realize you regret not having left sooner, and the time you wasted.
---
That's basically how abusive relationships work too btw, you wouldn't go to one of those people and say: "Why can't people move on from something they clearly enjoyed peacefully? Why is it always overdramatic nonsense?"     (yes i know this is an extreme example, but sometimes extremes are the best way to get the point across)
---
They have every right to feel regretful for wasting time after the fact. It's a normal reaction to have.
---
This is episode 1, not a trailer, not a beta test, it’s supposed to be happening now not later.... damn the delusion of you people
---
No new legendary really surprises me, because if there's one thing we all love, it's shiny weapons. A really cool ice weapon or two would have had everybody trying to get them immediately.
---
while i agree with you that the story patch was short, did you actually look at the achievements panel? or look at the karma vendor? there's an entire weapon collection to go for as well as tiered achievement rewards. i personally liked the ending and how they're handling jormag's character but that is an entirely subjective thing.
---
the meta is also pretty enjoyable, if a bit drawn out. 
---
i don't know what people are expecting out of story content, really. if they stuff in fight after fight, people don't like it. if characters sit down and talk and forward the plot, people don't like it. i think the section in the raven temple was pretty clever, so "just move at rp walk speeds" is a pretty reductive take on what they actually did here.
---
then again, i'm a fan of horror and the slow buildup of tension that results from that genre, so the change of pace was fine to me. i wouldn't say that i'm IMPRESSED by everything they've done, but it's not the worst story release they've squeezed out by far.
---
I'm just trying to be positive and encouraging to the devs... they seem down lately.
---
Did I miss them releasing the final episode of the season? I thought this was only the first one, and therefore we shouldn't expect 100% of the content from the season to be available. 
---
I know they spoiled us last season by including the Skyscale and Rollerbeetle in the first episode, but maybe they're saving some stuff for later this time?
---
Sometimes I legitimately wonder how many people in this sub are over the age of 12, after reading comments like that.
---
Yea... when LS4 came out, you could get XP in all of PoF for masteries. Same w/ LS3-&gt;HoT.  Here, you only have two maps you can get XP on. Bleh.
---
achievements are a reward for content. The achievements themselves are not content, nor should they be.
---
Sure a teeny tiny minority of achievement hunters consider them exciting and interesting, but most don't really look at them unless they really need to.
---
You mean u get the same 175k karma endless version?
---
Where can you get this tonic?
---
i took off the whole year... well .. oh shit...
---
It kinda feels like the prologue and ep1 were just one episode, and then they realised they didn't have enough content to give us early enough, so they split it into two artificially.
---
Not even, 3 people can take it down
---
3 mil karma? Geesh
---
Garden plots. They came before cooking, but they decided that gardening plot will be needed for for all ascended cooking. The more plots you have, the faster  you can grow stuff. 
---
Same day as the cooking 500 update hits.
---
&gt;For a limited time, the Black Lion Garden Plot Deed has returned to the Upgrades category of the Gem Store for 1,000 gems.
---
That margarine needs no salt added.  There is so much salt already.

Karma merchant by waypoint in the bjora march

It was 2 years for one of my best friends.
---
She logged one last time some time ago, life caught up to her, cannot play anymore, but I managed to say my goodbyes :) 
---
Good luck Eli 😁 you will be missed
---
I actually played though it with friends, and encountered NUMEROUS amount of issues when partied, story steps just would not complete with 1 person, and it would complete fine with another, or we would need to have eachother exit and reenter areas to have them retrigger to work
---
Lol but totally worth it
---
there is a guide  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW-8wHfBKtA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW-8wHfBKtA)
---
This isn't a trailer nor a demo, this is the entire first episode and it's extremely short.
---
They really should of just put the Prologue and this ep together as one episode.  It would have felt a lot more complete then and not have the big gap in the story that kind of looses the high of the chase feel the Prologue left us with.
---
My impression is that all the creatures related to the masteries (vigilant, abhaerrant, fallen) are warped by Jormag's influence, whether willingly (Vigilant), unwillingly (Fallen), or ambivalently (Abherrant). Since Svanir are loyal to Jormag, most of the Fallen are Kodan and other Norn Shamans that would normally fight its influence, and Abherrant are mostly "wildlife" creatures like skelk, warg, wisps (though I haven't really explored enough to know what a "haunt" is). 
---
The game doesn't really explain it for sure, but that's just my observations.
---
Excellent !
---
Is this after the patch today?
---
You were off to a good start, but then it devolved into drunken ramble by the end. 3/10.
---
Nice work with the snow puns.
---
I hope they can kick off the new year with something good. Between Jessica Price fiasco, lack of raids and fractals, announcement of no expansion coming, the layoffs, the build templates drama and the short episode 1, people are finally cracking and it's taking a bad turn.
---
new map, karma vendor in the keep
---
it might actually just be a bug.
---
Old masteries found in this map so far:
---
* Bouncing Mushrooms
---
* Updrafts
---
* Rollerbeetle Door
---
* Skyscale Rifts
---
Disappointed there's no thermal tubes or ley lines, but maybe in Episode 2? Though S3 masteries are the ones I find to be least likely, followed by S4 (but then again, there's at least one hidden rollerbeetle door...).
---
Last season did not have either roller Beatle or sky scale in the first episode?  We got a raid and a fractal though.
---
 It's the same story for me but with different games. Most players just want to consume the content when it's fresh and move away, they're not in for the game itself.
---
 Look at the bright side, there are still people playing, Global Agenda on the other hand :,(
---
Oh I’m not the only one, tho mines just the claws left the revive one disappeared when I finished it
---
i did look at the achievements, none of them are actually interesting... the food one was a back and forth fetch quest, the weapon one you just buy from the vendor and then the recipes, go find some chests yada yada. The ending of the story I didn't mind, but it was very anti-climactic, it felt like it shouldnt have ended there like there should have been a few more steps, it ended on a really low note far too quickly. Grothmar was miles ahead of this release overall.
---
No I gave up years ago. I still log in once in a while so I don't have to pay for content if I ever decide to go back, but there's no reason to at all right now.
---
Maybe add your hobbys or something. Its pretty hard to find someone you get along by adding random people. Act like you are dating this sub
---
Probably means typing. See that a bit in some discords. No one speaks, just types in chat.
---
Hi Roxy
---
I understand you're in NA servers. Could you be more specific on your actual time zone as well? It would benefit you and others to know roughly what times you are likely to play so that you can see if your schedules match. For example, I'm in Australia and playing with others in Canada or the east coast would be challenging due to time zone differences, despite being on the same server region.
---
[you mean this one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d1web4/full_english_translation_for_the_german_interview/)
---
If they state it as expansion level, then all that blame should be after trailer when then announced only one map, instead of 4, but not now.
---
I think she means Skype or other applications.
---
Map will be expanded with ep2 which hopefully is 2months away. Syory was idd too short tho.
---
I mean, I like PvE content the most. Is that what you mean?
---
Discord is a voice comms app for PC!
---
That was changed because it looked like human cultural t3, not legendary
---
Would love a new character select screen. Preferably with one where I can see my characters feet.
---
So, if they're trying to do monthly content, it looks like we can expect a new episode every-other month for a while:
---
December: Wintersday
---
January: Episode 2
---
February: Lunar New Year
---
March: Episode 3 (+ gem store sales)
---
April: SAB
---
May: Episode 4
---
It gets more murky around June/July because they've brought back Dragon Bash and the Festival of the Four Winds, but I don't think they have a set spot just yet. It's pretty far in the future, though, so we should probably focus on the more immediate future.
---
Ah, that's why then... I already had the first two masteries done before I started story (ported to map with a friend to do the meta for a bit). Guess I'll have to pester Anet about it.
---
&gt;it made me seriously reconsider my career choices, and the way I view gaming communities since then
---
Yeah I guess it's a product of the internet, but it's really sad how toxic the gamer community has become over the last 5-10 years--both to the people who make its entertainment and to the people trying to join the community. Makes me ashamed sometimes to call myself a part of the community
---
Apparently everyone in the sub forgot that they publicly announced at PAX that they took their three living world teams and redivided them into four. And this is after losing 131 employees in the layoffs, as well as others who may have left after (such as the eight going to Manaworks). So that means **fewer people working per episode**.
---
So yes, it's shorter than S4 episodes. That's to be expected with fewer people working per episode.
---
However - if ArenaNet manages to keep its promise - unlike Season 4, we will have 1) expanded maps in followup episodes; and 2) releases at a faster cadence (2 month instead of 3-4 month).
---
People are bitching now, but we won't actually see if ArenaNet manages to maintain their declarations made for Season 5 until January. So far though, they have.
---
When PoF came out you had limits on how many maps you could grind on; same with HoT. The content is coming, just chill.
---
I played without rushing, and it took me about 3 hours of active gameplay time - I know because I encountered the meta twice.
---
So I have to question the legitimacy of your claim about "not rushing".
---
oh ffs, they've been "ramping up" and "preparing" and "figuring things out" for years now. It's not going to happen.
---
It also lets people spam the request so it's still annoying in some part.
---
I'll be honest, I was expecting a side achievement chain that turned Eye of the North or the Battledepths into a hub for S5, full with access (either via NPCs or actual zone portals) to Grothmar and the new map, with blocked off passages to future maps in the works.
---
You must have taken a step between the whispers. ;)
---
Maybe you all don't remember because it's been awhile, but many PoF/Hot chapters don't take that long to complete, either. They start and end based on what a good start and end point is for that part of the story. If this really is meant to give expansion-time content over a LS time-frame, y'all can't be expecting to get everything on day 1 or else proclaiming the game dead. You have to keep in mind what PoF would have felt like if spread out over a year.
---
Yes
---
It's an option in general settings
---
Stve has a name, don't insult Steve
---
That was exactly what happened to me. It's games, something that people create for others to have fun. And like some sort of sudden detachment, I found myself muted in that TS, seeing people rage at some poor guy that worked for the company that was trying to craft something for people to have fun and enjoy. I'm not sure if it felt to me like drug people on withdrawal, or people who instead had a pretty good life, so such a reaction about a game was the top of their concerns. But the sudden "what am I doing here, is this where I'm headed and what I want to be part of" hit me hard.
---
Love the new launcher . thanks
---
Why? The game is badly optimised for current gen computers and is practically in maintenance mode.
---
There is a home instance node...
---
Other companies do that too fyi. I think it's fair to let them use usernames but this isn't some special Anet problem.
---
Any chance this a reference to the [Snow Dan](https://ratchetandclank.fandom.com/wiki/Snow_Dan) from the ratchet and Clank series?
---
Yes.
---
And it doesn't appear in the vendor list for me.
---
wait what? what happened?
---
People cry for less new maps with more shit in them. They get a map that will grow with the story. People are disappointed.
---
Why am I not surprised?
---
if GW2 is really the main goal... go for tue 9900k, but the graphics card could easily be a 1660 or something along those lines (the most important thing for GW 2 is single core performance of the CPU)
---
They said that the saga has a whole would have expension worthy content but would be comprised of smaller more frequent releases. I dont know why you all think you would get near of an expension worth of content on this release alone. Its like your all being willingly dumb.
---
&gt; People aren’t complaining about it not having an entire expansions worth of content, they are complaining it doesn’t have a living stories worth of content.
---
Perhaps, but it's not a traditional LS episode, or at least it may not be, given their statements. Again, we'll have to see what they do with it. People have been complaining that ep2 of The Mandalorian was too short, I enjoyed it though, and don't feel it would have benefited from being stretched to 40+ minutes, so I'm ok with that. We'll have to see where they go next with this. I can't say I *love* this patch, but I can't say that I hate it either without further context. 
---
Also, last season did not have a "prologue" episode. 
---
I guess my point is, last season ran from (basically) December 2017 through May 2019, 17 months, and consisted of 6 episodes, so roughly one per three months. 
---
If this season we had a prologue and an episode one two months apart, and unless there are shoes left to drop, this "episode one" is a relatively small one, we can agree on that. 
---
If all they do is release four more episodes of the scale of this one over the next 15 months, then I don't think I'd be happy with that. But that may not be what they have planned. The first two parts are already only two months apart, less than any previous gap. If they have another episode of Whisper's scale within two months, and continue to either complete the season in 12 months or run for more episodes over 17 months, that might be fine. Or if episode 2 has a lot more to it, that might be fine too. 
---
I mean, here's what the optimistic side of me is thinking: Instead of having a fixed standard that "each episode will contain 16% of one season's worth of content," they are spreading it out in a more "natural" way. If they have a tight, self contained concept they want to make, then they will release that, and yeah, it'll be smaller than we're used to for "one episode." But then maybe the next chapter, where the story makes sense to have more going on, where the geography of the map makes more sense to have more going on, they go bigger with that one, and it contains more stuff than we're used to getting from two episodes.  
---
I would rather they do that than to try and "stretch" each episode with filler story that does not advance the plot or characters in any useful way, or stuffing a map with events that don't really make sense or are fun to play just so that there is "enough" in that one patch. so long as at the end of the process it balances out, I would be fine with that. If not, I will be disappointed, but I'm just not there yet. 
---
And I'm still hopeful that there will be "expansion worthy stuff," just added at a later date. I agree that we haven't seen it *yet.*
---
Didn't take long for the whining to start once more, jesus christ this sub has gone to shit
---
I found it funny that it's a new launcher yet the loading bar, ready &amp; login buttons were still PoF colored for me. While new launcher is amazing I was still let down by no follow-up on the char select screen. Still PoF. Shame.
---
"Well raids and fractals are irrelevant, nobody cares about that stuff"
---
And stopped reading there. Opinion discarded.
---
I'd fkin play Cooking Mama if I want to level 'cooking'. Yeah. Everyone's like cooking 500! Cooking is Game! Cooking is Life! Cooking is...SAGA!
---
( .\_.)
---
Thank you! Submitted a bug report just in case, but will try it again tomorrow. Wouldn't care if it didn't gate a mastery point behind it... :(
---
&gt;And stopped reading there. Opinion discarded.
---
Fair, that's everyone else's position, including ANet's, when it comes to raids and fractals.
---
You save a whopping 5 seconds or one extra click with the flag.
---
You say that like I'm unaware of that.
---
I think I'm going to log in each release to get them free, then play through the whole saga after the last bit comes out. Maybe just unlock the track and low key grind xp in grothmar.
---
Everyone forgets about Heart of Thorns when they talk about more hard map-wide metas. We had those there, the community complained, they changed. They have being avoiding those since because of those same complaints.
---
Where's your full name to be accountable for all you do online?
---
That's a pretty dumb take you have here.
---
Should've included the champ npc somewhere in the background... "or my son's son ever again"
---
Blindly believing anet .. I knew 10people who got banned in that wave. they all got unbanned and no one of them knows someone who kept being banned. So yeah I don't believe anet it wasn't for arc dps. they saw the Reddit drama and pushed out a lie to calm everyone. 
---
Anet releases 2-3 episodes per year at best. trend going to longer time spans. So tell me how is 2021 an unlikely prediction?
---
Please
---
im talking about the story exclusively. i didnt say anything about doing the metas. i also didnt get any maps that were on the meta when i was playing.
---
This patch is a joke, it took like 1 1/2 hours to complete
---
Not only just the ridiculous amount of rage towards people doing their best, but also the general sense of entitlement is getting to me. Like, you don't have to pay anything for this game other than for two expansions, and people think that gives them a right to demand  that the game be exactly what they want 100% of the time?. They feel like the game itself has to constantly justify their already spending 1000s of hours grinding content, when any normal well-adjusted person who got all they could out of a game would just say "Well I had fun while it lasted" and silently move on to the next thing. I really don't get how people can feel they're entitled to act this way period, much less for a game that has provided content to them for 7+ years at a price of maybe $40-60
---
Maybe we will.  I hope they deliver two elite specs per episode.
---
Ye, but what do you mean with mics?
---
You are confused. This is expansion sized content.
---
This is still Episode one and it's the shortest we've ever gotten. Even if compared purely on other LS seasons, this one is still the weakest.
---
Please don't excuse what these people do.
---
i suppose you've totally completed every game released before GW2 then? or does it only count as content when it's stuff you personally want to do
---
&gt;I love how people target people who like the game, automaticallly as white knights. Did it occur to you that people could just, you know, have a different opinion than you.
---
What a coincidence that the different opinion always involves downvoting the truth since this whole controversy with ANet started and even reporting what you don't like :D
---
Oh it is. Just not the way you mean and the kind of break you meant.
---
Yeah hunger was good. I thought he was going to turn fallen at the end and fight you though.
---
They take very little xp to unlock. You'll have them in no time.
---
Thanks for this list! Is there a way to "save" a comment somehow someway?
---
You forgot that even the story is kinda bad, with them &gt;!killing Almorra solely for shock value and not even bothering to give her a worthy death, she's just randomly found under rubble dead because "someone buried her" with not even a clue to who it could've been.!&lt;
---
The atmosphere during the first quest was so good, almost reminded me of the Personal Story, and the feeling went away the moment the quest ended.
---
That's what I'm hoping for but they really should let us know that cause it doesn't come across very well that the prologue was meatier than episode 1. =\
---
&gt;The content is coming, just chill.
---
We've heard this excuse time and again.
---
I want all idiots who said "we dont need new map every episode" to apologize now.  
---
  
---
They though we will get 1 normal size map and they will expand it even more to twice-normal size map in next episode?  HA!
---
......I warned you it wouldn't be like that, but you didn't want to listen.. And now you have 1 normal map cut in half to be released in 2 episodes. 
---
So we will get 2 times less content now in next year. CONGRTULATIONS GUYS ! I hope you are happy now... You didnt liked new map every episode? now you will get what you wanted.
---
I said to myself "wow if the PROLOGUE is this big, imagine what the episode 1 is gonna be!"
---
Welp...
---
Not to mention it's pretty great for the economy every time a new legendary is released. Not having legendary weapons with releases going forward after they became a staple through S3 and S4 (hilariously since it this was on accident, since we thought all HoT legendaries would be in game before S3 even started), it's really sad to not have them anymore for new releases.
---
Define "indie MMO's" and give some examples. I'm unaware of any indie MMO's at all, let alone MMO's that put out content faster than GW2 with smaller staff.
---
The voice actomg is brilliant. But the quest itself is dogshit. It's the epitomy of a fedex quest : kill a rabbit en come back, kill a deer and come back, kill a bear and com back, kill a warg and come back...
---
Not to mention these targets are white mobs, so there isnt even the slighest use of the combat system whatsoever.
---
yes, so in 2 months we wont get shit actually.. just 1h extra story !. "we dont need new map every episode" right? This reddit favourite feedback! WOO-Hoo! idiots will get what they wanted. Thanks all who were saying that.. now the game went to shit... even less content then before in the next year, great guys! GOOD JOB!
---
I think that's fair comment.
---
Yeah, but it's not like they had this launcher ready a long time ago set for an expansion. Mike Z probably said "hey we're gonna have a new launcher for Icebrood Saga", and then someone from the art team made it in a day or less.
---
Yeah, I mean some amount of criticism is justified, I'm curious what they'll have to say during the next Guildchat. I'm just kind of use to them not explaining themselves or telegraphing future content, so I don't take a lack of warning as a sign that it does not exist. 
---
One thing that I think would be cool in this update is that they indicated that a certain character is having some personal drama going on. I think it would be neat if you could follow that up in story content that exists outside the bounds of the chapter or the new map, sort of like how they were doing "Current Events" a few years back, but on a more focused scale.
---
people who were saying this stupid things are mega idiots! I know from the start it wont be normal size map expanded later. It will be normal size map cut in half. So overall less content in a year. Bravo!
---
I’m new to WvW and was wondering if there is a reason to join anything other than eternal battlegrounds?
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
Yeah, you're right. No other new content has come out recently. Just the new launcher.
---
It’s about what you would have gotten with half the development time of the LS4 episodes.
---
"we dont need new map every episode" - idiots from reddit  
---
"ok then we will just take normal size map and cut it in half to give you in 2 episodes , even less work for us! great! WAFFLES TIME!" - anet
---
Hey friend, if you are still experiencing this issue:  
---
Abandon your story mission, and start a different one. After that, click to play the story again and go talk to the NPCs in the General's Quarters at the entry waypoint. This reset it for my fiance who was having the same problem.
---
If you're going to accuse positive players of shilling for anet, yeah, I'll say something.
---
Everything gets downvoted here randomly, be it positive or negative. It's not always the big bad white knights
---
Whoa, I have no idea how you got that many achievements done so quickly o_o I only got like 14 I think? If even that lol and I played for quite a few hours today
---
Maybe I'm just slow, Iunno. I liked the champions cause so many of them had new mechanics. They're not exactly hard for me, since I run raids every week and do CM's consistently,  but I like the new AI behavior and movesets they're dishing out here. The leaps that enemies do add a layer of fun because I can't always predict where they're going to go. Sometimes it's also frustrating when I pop down a well and they jump out of it, but still enjoyable. 
---
I do agree it feels bittersweet though. It was definitely shorter than even like, Grothmar, and that's saying something. The strike mission did show a lot of promise though, the first group I was in actually couldn't beat it. I still haven't unlocked the bonus chests with pugs simply because people don't know what they're doing lol
---
&gt; it gets exhausting to switch maps
---
First world problems
---
well considering you can buy them on TP...
---
Well its only 2 white mobs, then its a normal mob, a vet, and a champion
---
No, but reskinning fractals and raids like every other mmo is just as bad as assassins creed 1,2,3,4,5,6... its boring. I would rather they innovate than do that to be honest. And sadly we don't know what they are doing with all their resources.
---
This is also an issue with squads.  Griefers can just keep rejoining if you leave it open. That shouldn't be happening.
---
At least we got an expansion's worth of WvW and PvP updates!
---
It's interesting how people were saying that the Prologue was great, and since they promised the Episodes would be much grander in scale than the Prologue, people were getting moderately excited about it.
---
This release kinda showed that it was again all talk. The saga is just another living world release (or part of one). Maybe they realised that regardless of the amount of content they release, they see stable income from a part of their playerbase that sustains their studio. Their financial results seem to demonstrate that their financial success is connected to gem store sustainability and not game content. 
---
This was always a concern with a gem-store monetisation model: you disconnect the incentives to provide players with game content, with the financial incentive of selling things including gold and rewards in the gem store. As it stands, the game content could die out (as it is becoming more clear that this is happening), but as long as gem store releases are kept up to par they can be sustainable. We can't see what profits they are making but if their main cost is staff salaries and they can cut many content teams and maintain reasonable post-expansion revenue, then they are probably pretty happy financially.
---
Big oof
---
Yeah all anet has to do now is also tell the players actively not to play instead of just cucking the game with every update
---
Well then yes that's correct, but everyone was already used to swapping that so it wasn't nearly as big a deal. It would also just be good if they added it for that anyway because... people still do forget occasionally. Why wouldn't you want it?
---
Right? We could've had almorra snap and try to kill us, so we'd have to kill her. That would've been a lot better.
---
Total warhammer 2 has something like this and I love it there. Just select the background of the Expention/dlc you like and get in the mood for that content. Plus it would be great for making screenshot of your characters in appropriate settings
---
I read that already. If it’s just a carree thing than I hope it works put for her and she will be back sooner or later.
---
I hope they don’t fix it. Having a frame is awesome.
---
What kind of achievements do you find interesting? I don't mean that in an aggressive way or anything, I'm genuinely curious about what other people like/prefer out of the achievement system. I haven't done The Hunger yet so I can't offer any feedback on that one but my favorite achievements are the ones that tell a little story, something that adds a level of depth to the map without directly tying into the main plot. 
---
I like the look of the Boreal weapons but I do agree that it's kinda disappointing they're not tied into the lore of the map in any way. Not that all weapon collections have to be but I think thunderhead peak did a better job of this by giving each dragonsblood weapon its own story.
---
it'll appear if you don't have the prologue node. they forgot to change the flag to reference the new node
---
New Warclaw skin. 2500 gems.
---
Don't worry, Wintersday is month away. They can't fuck that up, can they?
---
it doesn't appear if you bought the prologue node
---
How do you not get the sarcasm in his comment lol its so obvious
---
It doesn't count as content per se, but I feel they must have spent some time doing some background animation and general improvements to some things.
---
Braham going around with you for example felt a lot smoother than having an npc in tow usually is. He was in sight for conversation, appeared to be sensible in understanding when I wanted to engage random enemies and when I wanted to ignore them and was generally a better experience than having npcs around has usually been for me. It actually made me think it would be nice if there was a way to take our guildmates exploring alongside us.
---
I also felt that they rebalanced a bit the difficulty; I am not really sure if this is the level I would have asked for, and maybe someone found it underwhelming, but I was getting pretty tired of fights in which I had no hope of not getting killed or surviving without relying on an NPC healing you (Taimi's golem fight comes to mind).
---
Most of the actual I found really good, especially the instances that really nailed the atmosphere for me. Got some problems woth how they dealt with the Almorra matter, especially as a Vigil. That's the only part I really felt out of sorts and it broke my immersion a bit.
---
So yeah, content was damn short and that's a let down. But I  will jump on the "let us hope releases will be more frequent" train and... well, hope. It wasn't bad, but it was really, really little.
---
Well that is massively disappointing and dispiriting. Strikes aren't really a replacement for either raids or fractals.
---
It was me and one other person. Probably could solo it.
---
&gt;  since they promised the Episodes would be much grander in scale than the Prologue
---
They said that?
---
Yes this happened at anet as well.
---
But...but doesnt that implicate that he is right?
---
Yikes.. why do you even play then?
---
How many more signs people need to realise the omly thing coming after this season is maintanance mode?
---
When? By who? I want proof, which noone provided so far.
---
What's your deal, you want them to post the actual threats that were sent to them or something?   If you don't think this sort of thing happens you're incredibly naive.
---
Pretty much all the original devs jumped ship or got laid off, how could you not expect this to happen?
---
The casuals who wanted quick 100% map completion complained*
---
Yes, I want proof. Just because someone claims they are oppressed doesnt make them true automatically, recently proved by metoo movement.
---
That's a great idea if there were content enough to play 5 hours straight in the new map.
---
You're only the 400th person to say this
---
The problem is in your question. Although I love GW2 lore I'm sick and tired of playing story instances at braindead difficulty for 2 hours and then having to wait a whole year to get a Raid or Fractal. If they want to move away from the MMO classics then do it and announce it so that I'll know that it is a full-steam catering towards players that are only invested into story bits and not mechanics/builds.
---
I loved the episode, it was really good. I challenge you to change my mind, OP.
---
You're just being paranoid here.
---
Oh ffs, you're one of those lot lol, invoking metoo. You'd just victim blame with proof anyway.  The devs said this happened and I believe it.  There's pieces of shit out there that say some of the vilest things over the most mundane occurrences, it happens all the fucking time.  Wake up and join us in the real world dude.
---
It's 1 hour of content now
---
This is stunning! Where's the petition?  I'll sign! 😍
---
&gt; There is a large contingent that always ignore the achievement content on the map
---
When you think of "expansion level content," do you imagine achievement hunting after an hour of story, with three rotating weekly bosses and no other content? Achievement hunting is Living Story level stuff. That's the whole issue.
---
If you're happy with this release, I'm glad that ANet is making somebody happy. But don't condescend to those of us who aren't. This was supposed to be different and more robust compared to past episodes. It was marketed as such. 
---
It is not.
---
It's literally how it works in every single game. Anet is just the first studio to call achievement "content" with a straight face.
---
Everybody complained actually. Hot was a hated xpac. Only now people like it.
---
&gt; Well you cannot play the leagues with old characters 
---
It would defeat the purpose of new leagues if you could play it with old characters tbh... The whole point is playing through the full game with its new mechanics, which gives you a chance to learn them, rather than jumping straight into the new end game with fully geared characters right off the bat.
---
As i said, i'd recommend just keeping some Standard characters &amp; some League specific characters, and rotating through them. It's a totally different experience, so it'll help keep things fresh. Path of Exile has always been the type of game to encourage a bazillion alts anyways.
---
&gt; your characters have a chance to lose their passives 
---
This is a benefit, not a problem.
---
They make small tweaks to the skill tree every league patch, so the reset gives you a chance to make any necessary modifications you might need to make, it usually results in buffs if you pre-plan... Otherwise, you can just redo your old skill tree again (which most players have memorized or saved anyways), it'll take like 2 or 3 minutes.
---
&gt; I am not amused by having to reallocate five L90+ builds every three months just to be able to use my characters 
---
If you have 5 level 90 characters, you should be familiar enough with the game to have memorized the passive tree and make the changes (or no changes) on the fly... I do it every league, and takes no more than a couple minutes.
---
I often also use this opportunity to completely respec a character to something else if i want to, which is awesome. Changing a level 90 to a completely new level 90, without the 100+ hours of grinding, is a bonus.
---
Nah, I ain't. I'm a Warrior of Darkness!
---
(Wait, is that critique in itself? 😛)
---
Ditch scepter for now. It has many aoe attacks and condi stuff, you'll end up missing more often than not, and deal some laughable condi damage which simply doesn't work w/o proper gear. Pick staff, or dagger/dagger. The latter one is partially condi as well, but still has more burst potential.   
---
Also try to put some runes, preferably any of the masterwork runes that have +10 power on their first bonus on your armor  
---
armor ofc up to your lvl, and with power+precision stats, take care of trinkets as well.   
---
you'll see a huge difference.
---
As the title says, this is all the possible combinations required in order to get the achievement "Mysteries of the Raven Sanctum", and the effects that each resulting boon gives. Feel free to use this in any comprehensive episode guides.
---
Well that’s contradictory..
---
what is guildchat?
---
Look that dervish. How beautiful it was.
---
Yeah, they can't have it both ways. 
---
People were always screaming they never listened. 
---
Now they are claiming that them listening was bad and they warned us this would happen?
---
lulwut?
---
You write words gud.
---
Maybe. The amount of plotholes filling plotholes is too many.
---
There's a difference between a not ele main and a new guy. You know more or less how ele works, you are used to using f1-4 on other classes, and have some grasp of the general mechanics, like dodging. For all we know OP might be just standing still, using 1 on scepter fire and wondering why he can't kill anything
---
How so?
---
Whatever they release further on, even if its on an expansion, won't be "Expansion level" because we are already used to them. A new expansion would bring new story, map, masteries, strikes, skins, achievements and elite specs, right now the only thing we're not getting are elite specs so if they release an expansion, the only "expansion level" content we'll get is that.
---
how is cooking monotized exactly?
---
Maybu after icebrood a new uxpac?
---
So?
---
You paid to get those animations.
---
You haven't paid gems to get a tonic. This is such a minor thing to complain about, it's ridiculous. Exactly why I am sick and tired of these whiny threads and indirectly all the negative posts that have been so dominant for the last months.
---
No, the game isn't perfect but people are grasping straws as thin as hair to create something to complain about and it's the most exhausting shit I have ever witnessed in my 30 years on this planet.
---
&gt;  that's everyone else's position, 
---
Define "everyone"...? Clearly most of reddit still cares, thus the upvote/downvote disparity.
---
Or do you mean the other players in the game? Because you have no way of knowing whether they like fractals or not, you're simply guessing.
---
This also doesn't take into account the **survivors bias fallacy**. Which is to say, you aren't considering the players who quit, due to lack of fractals/raids. Just because they've stopped playing, doesn't mean they weren't active players who enjoyed the game and that content.... They left **because** Anet stopped supporting the content they liked, Anet didn't stop supporting the content because they left. The order matters.
---
It would also be beneficial to take into account the overall "MMO" playerbase, from all mmo's, since they're potential costumers, and by neglecting potential costumers you've basically given up... Most MMO players **objectively** enjoy &amp; prefer challenging instanced content like Raids. There's a reason their communities (and subreddits) are doing better than GW2's, and i can promise you it isn't a coincidence.
---
Well, I mean, that's the truth (besides seconds option - that's just preference, I like it though).
---
I like that there is a new launcher, but changing launcher or background basically takes time of making a new graphics (let's be REALLY generous and say it's 4 days for 1 person for creating it and getting it approved, making small fixed by your boss demand etc.) + just switching old one for new one (should take 5 mins). 
---
They could have changed the character select ppl complain about already - like it's literally work for 1 person for max 4 days if you're going super slow - no wonder people complain.
---
It's a matter of scope. You can check all the boxes of content categories, but that still doesn't mean it will add up to an expansion's worth of stuff. That's why they need to clarify what they're planning. I'm putting elite specs aside as those are probably never going to happen again.
---
i do!
---
&gt;people bitch.
---
nuff said
---
&gt; If they want to turn this into a "come online once every two months for a four hour session" kind of game, they are doing it absolutely right.
---
They already did long ago, but it's also kinda meh when played that way.
---
There is a whole history mission dedicated to how Balthazar creates his minions, dude.
---
Set your settings to "new" instead of "hot" and you don't have to worry about whats popular or not.
---
Beautiful!
---
Damn, you're so negative. Go out, take a walk into the woods, take a deep breath, and enjoy what you were given. I'd also like to focus your attention on those awesome skins we had shipped with this patch, I'm of course talking about the gemstore ones.   
---
And, just in case someone was so naive to think I am so dumb to really think like that, it was sarcasm.   
---
^(In fact I am a bit dumber. Still, this patch is bullshit.)
---
War eternal and the prologue both took four months. So that’s one episode that took two.
---
No, only a new mastery item per episode, mounts asides. Season 3 brought one full line during the season, Season 4 brought one + 2 for the new mounts. Most of HoT and season 3 masteries also had no use outside of their own content and that's something they tried to fix in season 4 with new masteries involving mounts and some ways to use the old ones in the new maps.
---
What they are doing with masteries this episode is... Interesting. Almost sound as if you had the beginning of a skill tree. They might or might not capitalize on it on the next releases, there's an issue with their use outside of the map but I liked that they tried to experiment new things.
---
Do you know if bonus reward is weekly or daily ?
---
How about a menu where you can register for the boss you want and if the group is full you get ported. Similar to PvP queue.
---
Thank you SO much for this proper description... I really appreciate it immensely. And I also have to admit I'm slightly disappointed... But I suppose ArenaNet is trying its best...
---
Meh that stuff actually makes sense as a way to buy time for more development of new content. This news though... yikes.
---
What's worse than a negative subreddit? A dead subreddit.
---
People don't give a shit anymore. That's a trend I observe for a while now and has been confirmed with the latest release. Make of this what you will, but I don't think for a second that this is any good for the game or company.
---
They said from pretty early on in gen 2 that they weren’t planning on doing new underwater legendaries. As long as there’s no real content to use them in, I have to say I agree with that decision.
---
wow, I'm so blind. thank you!
---
&gt; Define "everyone"...? Clearly most of reddit still cares, thus the upvote/downvote disparity.
---
In the game. People that play the game. Most people that play the game don't have any Magnetite or Insights, most are relatively low Fractal level, few people care about instanced content of any kind. 
---
&gt;Or do you mean the other players in the game? Because you have no way of knowing whether they like fractals or not, you're simply guessing.
---
and using data.
---
&gt;This also doesn't take into account the survivors bias fallacy. Which is to say, you aren't considering the players who quit, due to lack of fractals/raids. 
---
They would still be recorded on sites like Efficiency that track player achievements. Besides, if they're gone, they're gone. No use crying over spilt milk.
---
&gt;They left because Anet stopped supporting the content they liked, Anet didn't stop supporting the content because they left. The order matters.
---
If you love someone, let them go. If they don't return, they were never yours to begin with.
---
&gt;It would also be beneficial to take into account the overall "MMO" playerbase, from all mmo's, since they're potential costumers, and by neglecting potential costumers you've basically given up... Most MMO players objectively enjoy &amp; prefer challenging instanced content like Raids. 
---
They can play those games then. It wouldn't be worth ANet's time chasing them, you can't please everyone, and the raider community is antithetical to GW2's core principles. 
---
&gt;There's a reason their communities (and subreddits) are doing better than GW2's, and i can promise you it isn't a coincidence.
---
They aren't though. GW2 remains one of the top MMOs out there, especially if you factor out the ones built on pre-existing IPs like WoW, FFXV, SWTOR, and Elder Scrolls. The only real issue this community has is raiders who keep complaining about the door hitting them on the ass because they won't keep walking. Once they're gone, things will settle down again. 
---
&gt;The only reason for this is because they can't figure out a way to monetize Raids/Fractals, and all they care about right now is milking their whales dry.
---
Also because not many players actually enjoy that content, and their efforts are better spent on content that people do enjoy.
---
Season one had a ton of trash as well though and none of those things are playable content now either, so returning players for a long time had nothing new, and new players were injected into a story halfway through with characters they didn’t know.
---
Buffs aside having to replay the instance **EIGHT FRIGGIN' TIMES** for an achievement has got to be a new record right? Not counting Hearts and Minds crashing all the time or challenges being hard, just the raw *mandatory* number of completions.
---
they said 2 months right? it used to be 3-4
---
I guess it's a matter of terminology, a line or an item. New map-specific masteries with limited applications outside of their maps have been a staple of Living World releases. Nothing indicates these masteries will have any use outside of the Icebrood maps, and it would be actively detrimental to new players to do so, given how all the events right now are awarding chests most people can't open. 
---
In contrast, the most important Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire masteries (gliding, raid masteries, and mounts) have a huge impact on how you play the game on any map. There's no comparison at all.
---
I still believe that 4th team they have working on unknown content, is the new expansion content.
---
https://youtu.be/Qa-CjS7xJNs

R/wffw
---
Usually anet tends to work in these details in text and vocal dialogue with npc's throughout the map and doing events. 
---
Unless you've explored the map 100% several times and have scraped out every inch of map and dialogue, I suggest you be patient and see what people find. :p
---
Might be a long shot, but are you using your fire skills? Most damage will come from there early levels. Maybe you accidentally switched to water and didn’t realize?
---
any signs of them adding in a tome for the portal scrolls yet?
---
Challenge Motes
---
Sunk cost falacy. I basically quit the game but like a needy ex I keep checking in on it.
---
I belive, I spended more time doing the mountraces in the Prologe , than on the new map completion. Kinda sad.
---
Can't change an objective fact
---
Use d912pxy
---
Wait what, where?
---
Ryzen 9 3950X 
---
Can't get any better than that.
---
Gw2 doesn't care much about your gfx card. But get either a 1080 Ti if you don't care about ray tracing. Or a RTX 2080 Ti if you have disposable income and plan on hopping on that wagon where it'll drop significantly in price before the software manages to catche up.
---
&gt;I think bonfires only prevent your debuff from stacking further, whereas the raven shrines cleanse it completely.
---
It removes the debuff stack by stack, but you gotta sit there for 10 seconds before it starts ticking, and it seems to only tick every 5 seconds. I think this was the design, but it's not a very good design for a meta where you gotta be all over the place.
---
Relativity people, Like lets take episode 1. Episode 1 was released 63 days after the prologue as opposed to season 4 average release of an episode every 104 day. As such Anet worked 1/2 the time on it, give or take a few days and they produced a map thats 172k pixels squared, were as if we take grothmar that was a map of 327k pixel squared (map at default zoom level) So we got a slightly larger area than 50% the map of the previous episode in 50% of the time which essentially makes them equivalent (actually prologue was in the oven for 124 days but lets go with the average none the less)
---
People wanted content more often and if the magazine interview from a couple of months ago is to be believed Anets intention is to release a new episode every 2 months for season 5 and place a festival in between and so far this seems to hold true. You cant have both the cake and eat it, content more often means less of it with each release, its not like in season 4 they were working 1/2 the time and resting the other 1/2. Releasing every 60 days or so means they'll only have about 50% of the content of episodes they previously spent 105 days on and possibly less because wrapping things up for release has its own overhead which now is doubled. 
---
Now I know when people wanted more content / shouting about content droughts they meant primarily more fractals / raids and what we got might very well be the opposite of that. Just to make sure my post gets more unpopular than it will undoubtedly be, I have to unfortunately point out this is exactly why hyperbole and such actions are a bad idea. Trying to force a company into action can be dangerous. Without an unlimited budget you cant magically produce more content, the only way to do that is to hire more people. There too they had to compromise most likely. To do such content more often they have to descope it and I guess strike missions is what they come up with.
---
&gt; Wouldn't it be cool to have a central hub like the lion's arch aerodrome for raids?
---
Why not add it to the Aerodrome as well? I mean, isn't that what that is, a hub for instances group content?
---
I had hopes, i think that was my mistake
---
It's kind of a creepy collection,  but I was disappointed how short and easy it was.
---
You guys are getting 2 hours of content? I couldn't even play Bound by Blood because of the buggs ;\_;
---
I was surprised people found it dark and scary? The only reason season 2 worked was because the story patches came out every two weeks. I feel with 2-4 months wait time the complains will only grow because the pause between story is just too big. I do think quality wise it seemed fine but to be honest I'm getting really tired of fighting dragons.
---
Ah! So it goes down as slowly as it accumulates. About 90 seconds for all stacks, then. Too bad it's usually not much of a consequence to get frozen, anyway.
---
Is the raven santum daily? Or can I just run all 7 left at one time?
---
&gt;Could literally just put the Eye of the North theme
---
And have people shout that the game is entering maintenance mode just how first game did after EotN.
---
you can go there daily, and there are chests with the material for the boreal weapons at the end
---
That's not a reply to anything I said, yet exactly the kind of response I expect from a gandara ranger.

Ey, I have a screenshot like that too

---
I'd rather have Joko taunt/mock me for playing too much.
---
It was originally a tongue n cheek joke at people who managed to trick the system I believe
---
We've been reduced to nothing a while back.
---
I think people have just lost hope for the game to be anything more than it is. Consistently wanting more from Anet and being disappointed led to apathy regarding the game's state. People are moving on to other games and accepting gw2 for what it is, a game they can log into once every 3 months and play through the new content in a few hours.
---
it hasnt changed since pof release huh? Im gonna hop on because of the launcher lmao
---
Okay ... but I don't see what that has to do with multiple paths complicating an autogrouping thing?
---
At least Anet is consistent at this one thing.
---
Well they did declare that the prologue was a shorter version of the saga episodes, hence a „prologue“ and not episode 1.
---
This strongly implies that the full episodes will be mich larger, no?
---
"All the new content"
---
&gt; I've been thinking about it since we woke Mordremoth. Since Jormag was always an Elder Dragon that seemed like it just might be willing to communicate, after the death of another it seemed likely it would when we finally got to it. So I'm glad that we're having an Elder Dragon that's "offering a truce" because of how powerful the Commander is.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; And in all honesty, it's an offer worth considering.
---
Well it would be *for any of them other than Jormag!* The *one* dragon we **know** to lie and deceive even in dealings with those who willingly worship it well before we actually mount an offensive against it. Mordremoth could at least have pleaded self-defense and otherwise would have fit this plotline very well, both because of his ties to the sylvari and because we had no prior interactions with him. Meanwhile the Sons of Svanir have been shown to be deranged and dangerous cultists from day one and were **repeatedly** shown transforming into mindless monsters.
---
That's why what they seem to be trying to pull here doesn't work for me. Jormag has always been a compelling puppet master behind *other villains* but because of that we also know it's a lying liar that lies. Even if the offer *was* genuine it still has no one other than itself to blame for us not trusting it and deserves to get offed for all the pain it has caused the norn and kodan. To me there is no moral conflict here, and I will be very annoyed if the Commander or their close allies pretend otherwise.
---
&gt; If only for the reason that if we kill another Elder Dragon without a replacement, the world dies... and we don't have a spare replacement.
---
Except LS4 kinda implied Aurene could handle the entire spectrum of magic and Glint's Legacy didn't seem to include any plans for dealing with the remaining three EDs after Glint, Vlast and Aurene each had their lunch.
---
I dont :)
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celestial_Axe_Skin
---
They said they wanted to always have *something* running, so one month festival, next living story, then event (like world boss rush) then festival, then event and so.
---
They already claimed that it will be expanded (or at least changed in some way) in episode 2. If my memory serves right, this was when they announced the Saga.
---
I found this weird bug and took a pic, but now after logging off I realized I should have done in game bug report. &gt;! In the story while you have to help out your friends find Almorrah, I went to help Rytlock and Crecia. They had their talk together at the end. Then I went to help braham, and while helping him I got this chat, with the voices and lines of Rytlock and Crecia, but the names are wayyyy off! Any idea who the names are? https://imgur.com/a/ladyvyd !&lt;
---
They should have added it as a PS in the achievement description.
---
**Best served daily.*
---
If they announced an expansion a year before release and it had a full swath of dungeons, raids, pvp/wvw updates, and progression systems. And if they worked on their promotional material so that people are constantly reminded of the impending release.. people will come back after a year. FFXIV and WoW do this all the time.
---
Yeah the story was short and the map is small, but I don't think I can say anything just yet. If they drop a similarly sized patch the next month then great, I can get behind it. But if their release cadence is 2+ months than that is going to be a problem.
---
It's 10%, not 10€
---
Because we would have the same problem we did have between season 2 and HoT, month of nothing and then we get inpatients, anets rushes the addon and we get a cut story like HoT
---
I didn't say that. Everything has to have a fine mix. This is just a downward spiral that is ever-present in the whole World in my eyes. Half the effort, half the durability.  GW2 seriously missed the aim for what it shot for in the beginnig which is heartbreaking for me coz I love this game and these devs. The sentence, this game never aimed for challanging conent is not true. Look up the pre-release interviews. Dungeons were supposed to be a Raid-like difficult content but they faked it up. So after a couple of months, the more invested people already began quitting bcoz they culd faceroll the dungeons with using auto attacks basically. Then we arrived to a place where a beautifully designed HoT maps caused havoc amongst players who remained and used to kill mobs with an autoattack. That was a really sad moment. First raid came 3 years into the game and at that point there were more slackers and bots in the game then invested players. That is why anet has figures that show, almos tnobody plays raids. But let's move away from Raids. Fractals are not difficult. Yét, they faking ignore them. Heartbreaking, truly heartbreaking.
---
Which of the three essences do I need? Or does it rotate?
---
Is there a droppable home node like it was in the prologue? Spent 60g on it from vendor only to realize I could have bought it from the TP for 15g
---
Yep. New episode. Go play it.
---
I feel like people see this as a bad thing, like if you play an MMO that should be the only thing you play.
---
AI controlled doesn't mean it has to like a choreographed routine. In fact AI should be less. Lack of AI would lead to more static routines.

Blue and yellow should never be together!

---
Ye it’s also a joke, lamo
---
well that is not as bad then
---
Excuse me, I have a question.  
---
What's the big fucking deal, bitch?
---
Just being mean because of the state of the game
---
So many people that seem to hate the game, just can't stop talking about it.
---
Calling you a whiteknight is objectively true.
---
The new lion looks like he's a bit 'special'
---
Nice
---
So the did release all the saga episodes yet or are you judging from a prologue with a concert and a first small chapter which prepared the mood of the saga? 
---
The only critic to the new map is that the story is  short. Now every book need to be war and peace.
---
You complain just for karma
---
So that was why it was delayed.
---
Fuck you and your unreasonably high expectations if you don't want to pay for a bunny skiN!!!!!!
---
Funny that you say that when ANet's been yelling around the word "free" to advertise the LS5 since last year.
---
is this the new argument of the whiteknights??? XDDDDDDDDDD
---
You are delusional
---
It's on the table.
---
Several of the people that replied to you post petty fluff and "this community amazing" style threads whenever this sub gets negative, just to counteract it. They're not whiteknights, just dedicated fans!!!!!!
---
Just an fyi :)
---
FSP was stuck in T5 because Arborstone was a dead link where everyone on it transferred to be with WSR, so FSP heavily lacked coverage.
---
I agree that fractals aren't difficult. But there are plenty of players for whom T4 fractals are, and some players find T1 Fractals difficult.  Difficulty isn't something you can define with a capital D. There are widely varying skill sets at play here and different groups of people judge what's difficult quite differently.
---
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. I wouldn't dream of trying to build a house, but I can fix the hell out of a computer. When I'm with my handy friends, building and fixing up stuff, they all laugh about it. They physically block me from trying to get to the power tools. All in good fun of course, but it's pretty accurate. It's not where my strengths lie.
---
Be happy you're good at games. Some people started playing a lot later in life, some are disabled.  If it's easy for you, that's great. Not everyone is in the same boat.
---
He's not calling out people who have a different opinion. He's not even calling you out specifically. He's calling out the people who defend Arenanet regardless of their mistakes. 
---
And there's a short way of referring to those people.
---
If you're not that kind of person then it doesn't really matter, does it.
---
All from the wiki
---
most likely the latter
---
This achi seems to bug out. I did AAA, BBA and BAA but progress for last 2 didn't register for some reason. Wonder if anybody else had the same issue.
---
Yeah..with all the info they've given us so far, this is most likely what has happened, makes me really sad.
---
But when you read what he said, he's implying if he's being downvoted it's by a white knight. It's like trying to invalidate contrary opinions.  I'm sorry but I've seen too much of this to just let it go and I won't.
---
Perception management is important. This is why companies have communications and PR teams. 
---
With the theatre announcement and prologue episode everybody's expectations were set to expect something bigger. Episode 1 should have been bigger or it should have been combined with the prologue. 
---
You can't blame people for expecting more considering the way Anet set them up to.
---
Skimmer: Fixed a bug that caused the Barrel Roll engage skill to travel less distance than intended.
---
Finally
---
To me the biggest take-away now that I've essentially quit GW2 for good (as much as you can truly quit a game that asks no subscription of you and doesn't increase the max-level, but I don't even have the Skyscale 😅) is how incredibly little ANet invests into **system changes**.
---
I mean, I get where it comes from. GW2 has always done ["design by landfill"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL_bCwiUKNE) (old extra credits episode about it), and it worked alright in the past. Sure, it means that they shower you in extra currencies that are never used again but so long as the UI sorts it out it doesn't truly matter.  
---
But I already touch upon the problems there: design by landfill requires intelligent filtering of game content for the player so that the resulting "view" you get feels meaningful and everything fits together. It also means that you need to very very carefully decide what to just pave over and what to actually rework.
---
ANet... doesn't do either well. At all.
---
This is mostly prevalent when looking at how they refuse to touch core issues because it'd mean they'd actually have to rework things. Their "full reworks" are a dozen changes to a class mechanic. In other games that's a minor rework at best. There is no working on core combat system elements. Nothing like that at all.
---
Combined with the slurry of game elements that all go untouched and forgotten and litter the game, it all feels so.. "cast aside", maybe?
---
Ascended.
---
The Prologue actually gave me some hope..
---
And this Episode woke me up.
---
You're out of touch if you think gw2 is in a healthy state. Being hopeful doesnt mean its realistic. 
---
Gw2 has seen a steady downward trend in so many metrics it's funny to see people deny it. Revenue, content, studio size, reception of their output, PR and marketing disasters, repeated cashgrabs and no clear future in sight...
---
for each essence mastery line do i need to have both levels unlocked to open the big chests? 
---
and do i need to do the achievements to get all the necessary blue mastery points to unlock everything?
---
The buff might carry into other maps. 4 months is more than enough time to do it 8 times ahead of the next release.
---
yes, it's coming in episode 2
---
I think people hate ANet for how they manage the game, not the game itself.
---
I think your reply is missing a /s
---
Pace yourself instead of rushing through and maybe you'll run out of things to complain about.
---
Dumb fuck players thinking anet is even trying to keep gw2 healthy. They're not. They're prolonging its end of life while milking it for money, likely for other projects.
---
His post is talking about the original post. How is it off topic.
---
Guild chat is a weekly live stream the devs do. Last week they did a preview of the new Episode. They did post a couple days before that that the stream would be about the new episode
---
We are dissapointed that the MORE CONTENT part is missing oh wise one
---
His post is talking about a specific group of people downvoting the post.  That could be said for any post. It doesn't further the conversation at all.  Let's pretend some people downvote the post because they're white knights. Another group downvotes because they disagree. No one can tell which is which from that. It has no value other than saying some people will automatically downvote this post. The post isn't about downvoting. Now if some people are not hiding the failings of the game but they genuinely like it, they call get lumped together with white knights. You don't see it, because you're not in the group, so it's okay for you. I'm telling you it's not okay for some of us. And that's the last I'll say on it, because this is now ALL off topic. Feel free to get the last word.
---
At this point I'm pretty sure the GW2 team is now literally 3 people, a developer and 2 community managers.
---
I think the Fallen are dead/spirits. Jormag's influence, whether by directly corrupting them or convincing them to lie down and die (as we see with Vigil/Bright Shore that lie down in the snow, convinced they can't move), killed them and they're angry souls that can't move on. If you look at them, they're transparent like Ascalonian ghosts and other spirit enemies throughout the game.
---
The Aberrants almost seem demonic, especially given the Wisps and the Boneskinner. I wonder if there's another force at play here, especially considering the ending scene/statements of the episode...
---
It has been clear as day for a few years now. They've been removing support without ramping up production in other areas for years.
---
The only difference is there is SO little left it's getting hard for certain people to deny.
---
People have been asking for a new launcher for years. Of course people are going to be happy about it when it happens.
---
i absolutely loved the article. The info seems to be complete, not requiring me to google the info elsewhere(like how the new rabbit looks like)
---
Or maybe the people that "give a shit" simply feel less and less willing to visit a subreddit where every single piece of positivity gets downvoted to hell or outright attacked and they simply play and enjoy the game instead?
---
I don't think the other Elder Dragons would fit the "making a deal" scenario because of how they corrupt. Jormag is the **only** Elder Dragon who doesn't forcibly enslave subjects (granted, Sons of Svanir do this, but Jormag's more direct orders never do). Hell, Jormag even [let the Commander go once already](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Frost_Portal) after the Commander proved their might.
---
Also, Jormag doesn't really lie and deceive - Jormag's promises of power or protection isn't entirely false. The Sons of Svanir *do* become stronger after becoming corrupted, and they do become safe from other Elder Dragons, age, hunger, etc.
---
As to the Sons of Svanir - the deeds of fanatics doesn't rightly represent the deeds of the represented. It's also proven that Jormag doesn't care about the day-to-day stuff of mortals, but is more big-picture thinking.
---
On top of that, added this release, there's a new book in Asgeir's Legacy area called "A Burden" which basically says that Asgeir only survived because Jormag let him go after losing that tooth - that Asgeir proved the might and worth of himself and his people because of his strength, despite being worn out, and offered Asgeir (and by proxy, the norn) a chance to live.
---
That isn't to say Jormag is a "good guy" - they aren't. They're definitely evil. But of all the Elder Dragons, Jormag has always been represented as the most likely to see reason and become the "lesser of two evils". Just like Joko was in GW1. Joining an alliance with Jormag is definitely a short term thing for fighting a greater evil that should lead in to trying to redeem Jormag should it come to pass (but it most likely won't).
---
&gt; Except LS4 kinda implied Aurene could handle the entire spectrum of magic and Glint's Legacy didn't seem to include any plans for dealing with the remaining three EDs after Glint, Vlast and Aurene each had their lunch.
---
No, it didn't. Don't confuse being able to handle a small portion of conflicting magic by sharing magic with mortals, with being able to balance and maintain The All. The entirety of Season 3, Path of Fire, and Season 4 has explicitly stated, multiple times, how we need at least four living and separate Elder Dragons for The All to not become imbalanced and destroy the world. It isn't even about the amount of magic or balancing magic, since as Taimi said in Season 3, we can handle more magic in the world from ED deaths; it's The All becoming imbalanced that can destroy the planet.
---
As to Glint's Legacy - while we don't know how they planned to deal with the second half of Elder Dragons, it was pretty explicitly shown that the plan was to replace all six. After all, Glint had about two dozen eggs, so they likely hoped more than two would hatch.
---
Swede? *notches arrow and draws bow* or Consortium?
---
Yeah the truth is that LS episodes aren’t enough to sustain the game. All the expansions gave the game the breathe of fresh air it needed and it’s been over 2 years since the last one. All ik adding a small map every 3 months that can be thoroughly explored in a couple hours ain’t gonna sustain the player base for long. And all the Anet stans act like farming map material to unlock garbage weapon skins is engaging content. They put more time into the gem store items than the LS episodes.
---
Consortium ? *prepares sic em* or NCsoft?
---
&gt;The implication is that the game is failing and that white knights are the only ones downvoting this thread.
---
I don't read that implication at all. Because he's addressing *white knights* specifically, as a subset of downvoters. He didn't once equate the two groups, downvoters and white knights.
---
The problem with arguing about implications is because you're not arguing about what was said. It's all personal opinion and interpretation. Which can be more or less founded in reality, but still isn't a dispute grounded in hard facts with a certain conclusion.
---
Not that it really matters. Way I see it, if you're innocent, be cool. Only the guilty should be taking offense.
---
Checked the endless tonic and you definitely have to use it from your inventory to get the achievement.  If you add it to the wardrobe then a normal one is your only bet.

People complain because they love the game. Criticism is the apex of fandom.

Maybe we will all end up like you, disregarding feedback because "it's a dead game after all, why bother giving feedback, there is no future for the game".
---
We are going into seasonal festivals. The cadence is going to be at least two months.
---
what a gorgeous game that is
---
and i miss dervishes so much. an amazing class
---
I loved that they pulled off the Eldritch thematics so well. Going through Raven's Puzzle and having shadows attack you, the giant appear and dissipate, and then your allies tell you that they never left (not to mention the final shot with the shaman)
---
Then you take into account the constant whispers as you roam or even while idling, seeing the effects on NPCs like Elina and Aja stuck in a loop of constantly searching for answers that wear the detective down over time, and the emotional scene with Marjory and her fear of Belinda's spirit suffering. If they can keep this up, I think this season will be awesome.
---
It's second time Anet killed a female character with the sole reason of giving Braham something to angst about. In LS3 is was "Waaaah, my mother whom I didn't know at all died so now I'm SAD and ANGRY!". Now in LS5 (oh, sorry, *Saga*) it's "Waaaah, the leader of Vigil was killed by a guy I knew so now I'm SAD and ANGRY!" I half-expect Braham to throw a "None of you know how it feels to have people you know to die!!!!" tantrum again.
---
To be fair, she deserved more voice lines or a more active part in ending Kralkatorrik if she is dead now. I get that it was a troubled time for Anet and I personally think War Eternal was a pretty amazing patch altogether, but all Almorra got were like, three to five voice lines and a cameo in the main encampment...? 
---
That's not how you do an important lore character justice. And especially not if you're going to kill them afterwards.
---
Arrow carts are part of the game design the last time I checked. If you do not know how to deal with them, just git gud.
---
I still do not believe FSP/UW is as intense with siege as many of the German servers who bunker down like it is Normandi all over again.
---
You are completely correct that FSP is heavily being carried by UW, I will not deny that, but FSP has always been greatly PPK focused while UW is more PPT focused and the historical link relationships have always been good.
---
Not having the players from Arborstone, even it was only "20", still had its impact.
---
&gt; People here forget so quickly.
---
oh, the irony.
---
expension level content in **the course of an whole season** was what mike z said on stage and several interviews after.

you morons always spin everything to your benefit.

I play this game on 4K resolution with 9900KS @5.2 Ghz, 1080Ti, 32 GB ram and I get 90-100 FPS in open world. The key is to install dx12psy, that app enables you to utilize all cores and GPU to achieve high FPS and stability.
---
Don't go for AMD. Even with AMD 3900X if you play only GW2 (AMD is badly optimized for GW2)
---
Out of interest, do we even have a community manager anymore, and if we do, why are they not actively addressing these concerns on this subreddit?
---
Having recently joined, I am less inclined to play each and everytime something like this is mentioned. I can't believe they have nothing in the pipeline to keep people playing..
---
At this rate, PvE will get the same treatment as WvW and PvP.
---
My pet theory is that their contract stipulates that NCSoft takes a large percentage of expansion sales, but not gem store sales. So I think that they wager that giving away free content leaves people more likely to spend money on the gem store, whereas releasing expansions just causes a large part of their income to vanish to NCSoft.
---
fuck off
---
Thank you both for the kind words!   
---
\&gt;  The tone is succinct and informative, without being a dry bullet point list   
---
This is a massive complement, thank you so much!  
---
\&gt;  I would see value in giving \*all\* the details, such as recapping exactly  how the 3 essence mastery tracks work or even posting screenshots of  the tracks, especially since that was already 'spoiled' to some degree   
---
This is a great point and not one I'd thought of, will definitely take this into account in the future.
---
Im a pretty casual player and finished this chapter in one sitting.. never done this before.  And I wasnt rushing it either. I did a bunch of events along the way.  Hopefully the strike missions are a bit more satisfying.
---
I think they meant major events like festivals. Next that is on the table is Wintersday and Episode 2. I assume the release schedule will look like this: Lunar New Year, Episode 3, SAB, Episode 4, Dragon Bash, Festival of the 4 Winds/Episode 5 (hard to say about what will come sooner, Dragon Bash and Fot4W are rather close together)
---
All maps have value to go to. EBG just has the big keep in the middle to fight over, it's not considerably more important than the borders.
---
Literally ignoring the fact that before all this negativity there were threads upon threads of extremely well put together constructive feedback (who is always completely ignored) is "well informed"?

bullshit. every mmo with achievements calls them content, because they *incentivize* to play content.

What made GW2 amazing to me was the map metas from HoT, and stuff like the Tequatl event. In my mind, ANet has *solved* the issue of storytelling in MMO's with those types of events. We play for the scale, for the community, and of course the gameplay. Map metas give us all of these. Metas don't stick us alone in an instance where we get jerked off by NPC's telling us how amazing we are, like we're playing some single player RPG. We're part of a larger group that depends on collaboration to get things done. That's more fun and more impressive.
---
What's particularly great about it is that it's self organizing. As people learn the events, they do them in a mostly organized fashion. They can wing it. There's this illusion of coordination brought about by everyone having a good understanding of where they need to be. And mentoring new players is easy, because pretty much anybody can tell them what to do. The amount of coordination required is pretty small. It works to the strengths of the medium and it's very new player friendly.
---
It's not a replacement for raids or dungeons, but it's a fantastic way of doing story content. Using maps and group events to tell a story about a *group* of people accomplishing something great, rather than a single player narrative. It also allows players to craft their own fantasy for their character instead of being shoved into the over used mold of god-slaying hero.
---
Getting next in January is okay for me, 2 months and holidays in between that, sounds good.
---
The problem is that reddit will shill that it is either not enough content, or it takes too long for next chapter, so it is as with the raven choices....
---
*Whistles for my trusted companion and prepares we heal as one* one should not pick a fight with a lady, certainly not one who has not had their morning coffee yet
---
And who are you and who cares?
---
&gt; Nice strawman argument.
---
a big fat LOL to that.
---
what ghoulbakura said is **exactly** what you morons say about every LS release the last 3-4 years and criticising the game for.
---
are you fucking kidding me?
---
If you think that is close to a legendary, then you haven't seen or owned any legendaries methinks. Sure it has a few effects, but compared to legendaries or even other blacklion exclusives, this isn't too special.
---
It was just sort of strange but not really creepy to me... until the "What's Happening?" book dropped from the final part where you kill a Boneskinner. The slow realization that the Boneskinners are Kodan just like Bright Shore who have been slowly overcome by this corrupting hunger, and you've been helping create another one, is pretty terrifying and very appropriate for a Wendigo monster.
---
Oh yes finally &lt;3
---
So many people that love the game would rather defend it on reddit than actually play
---
Despite the tiny scale of this map, simple meta and rather easy events, I actually really *really* enjoyed the atmosphere that this episode gave off. The creepy vibe and finding odd things (I followed a Vigil Recruit out into the map where I then figured out Jormag was sweet talking them into effectively committing suicide by telling them to freeze to death in a certain area). Last instance was pretty fun, I hda fun doing it, though still felt lacking and short. I scavenged the map for any other fun details, but the only real thing I could find was a clientside crying ghost that would sometimes appear. The Bright Shore achievement was really fun, I feel like he might become a Boneskinner due to some other NPC dialogue I heard...but all in all, I felt there could have been more. 
---
I am disappointed that the map was so small and that the story we got felt a fraction of a 'real' episode. I really hope that either next update is sooner to compensate for less content or the next update has more content. I'm not sure I like the idea of this short of an episode every 2-3 months. I want to have hope that this whole arc will go over well...cross my fingers at least.
---
you still are stupid, becuase its about the incentive the achievements give to play the content. therefore they are part of the content.
---
Dude. Dont worry about anything before lvl 80 and especially before lvl 30. Just play and do random stuff hahah
---
Yeah, I was so hyped on what we are going to get after such an amazing prologue. And well, it wasn't much.
---
Quality isn't the problem, it's the quantity.
---
&gt; I don't think the other Elder Dragons would fit the "making a deal" scenario because of how they corrupt. Jormag is the only Elder Dragon who doesn't forcibly enslave subjects (granted, Sons of Svanir do this, but Jormag's more direct orders never do).
---
Where do all those other Icebrood come from then? Jormag has absolutely no qualms corrupting by force, **or** has absolutely no hold over its minions unlike any other dragon yet remains forced to pour magic into them all the same. Or are you claiming the Claw of Jormag was a Svanir creation?
---
&gt; Hell, Jormag even let the Commander go once already after the Commander proved their might.
---
"Let go" implies it had any actual choice at the time. I doubt it actually had the means of preventing you from just running away. Plus we don't even explicitly know that was Jormag in person (as opposed to a corrupted Shaman or kodan) although it does fit.
---
&gt; Also, Jormag doesn't really lie and deceive - Jormag's promises of power or protection isn't entirely false. The Sons of Svanir do become stronger after becoming corrupted, and they do become safe from other Elder Dragons, age, hunger, etc.
---
Getting philosophical but it certainly doesn't protect the "you". The Svanir turn mindless and eventually become Icebrood with neither their physical bodies nor their original minds intact. And the "safety" part is the same as any other conqueror, not an actual guarantee but conditional to "if we win and wipe out everyone else".
---
&gt; As to the Sons of Svanir - the deeds of fanatics doesn't rightly represent the deeds of the represented. It's also proven that Jormag doesn't care about the day-to-day stuff of mortals, but is more big-picture thinking.
---
Unless Jormag has a vastly different relation to its minions the deeds of the Icebrood **do** represent it. And they are murderous all-consuming monsters just like all the others.
---
&gt; On top of that, added this release, there's a new book in Asgeir's Legacy area called "A Burden"
---
Haven't found that yet so who is the author?
---
&gt; That isn't to say Jormag is a "good guy" - they aren't. They're definitely evil. But of all the Elder Dragons, Jormag has always been represented as the most likely to see reason and become the "lesser of two evils". Just like Joko was in GW1. Joining an alliance with Jormag is definitely a short term thing for fighting a greater evil that should lead in to trying to redeem Jormag should it come to pass (but it most likely won't).
---
But what is the "greater evil"? If Jormag just shuts up and builds more ice walls instead of continuing to tempt and enslave people it is very likely *both* sides would benefit instead of killing each other in the backstabbing bonanza I expect from this "Saga" now.
---
&gt; No, it didn't. Don't confuse being able to handle a small portion of conflicting magic by sharing magic with mortals, with being able to balance and maintain The All. The entirety of Season 3, Path of Fire, and Season 4 has explicitly stated, multiple times, how we need at least four living and separate Elder Dragons for The All to not become imbalanced and destroy the world. It isn't even about the amount of magic or balancing magic, since as Taimi said in Season 3, we can handle more magic in the world from ED deaths; it's The All becoming imbalanced that can destroy the planet.
---
Where does the number four come in explicitly? I only recall Taimi's simulation and warnings about Kralk which could just as easily be interpreted as a very specific practical assessment that flooding more/different magic into the system *in its then-present state of chaos* would tip it over. In fact the [Kesho cinematic](https://youtu.be/ZtqDLw0D5HM?t=38) claims two near-simultaneous deaths already were too much and "the collapse" began with four EDs alive and well.
---
Plus I believe both to be fundamental threats: too much raw magical energy of any nature will cause the planet to physically unravel and be consumed by chaos, while The All falling out of balance will probably cause a more metaphysical issue such as all of reality potentially merging back into the Mists or something like that. The "balance" certainly isn't relevant in the immediate physical sense as depicted in Avatar (or God of War I guess) where eliminating an anchor causes the respective element to die out or go haywire. Zhaitan's death did not cause a global plague or inability to die, Mordremoth did not take the actual jungle down with him.
---
&gt; As to Glint's Legacy - while we don't know how they planned to deal with the second half of Elder Dragons, it was pretty explicitly shown that the plan was to replace all six. After all, Glint had about two dozen eggs, so they likely hoped more than two would hatch.
---
That seems awfully stupid for a planning and *prophetic* leader to have only two Scions on her radar when the dragons are already rising. Absolutely no blame for getting herself killed but the eggs should have been hatched already *before* Kralk woke up.
---
Previous one as in hatched chili node? Neither me or my husband own that, and while my husband can see/buy the new one, I cant, so I don't think it's that.
---
I mean....you really think they're going for another "full" set of legendary weapons?   
---
At most i expected underwater legendaries, those are the only one left to make gen2 actually complete
---
Can you give examples of what you bought/what I brought you vs what you can get from Gw2? 
---
All games I own that offer mtx only offer crap skins so Gw2 is so far the only game I’ve ever spent money on mtx.
---
I think we are coming to the realisation that we may as well cheer for the slightest things that go right since anything we complain about and they change/go in a new direction with ends up only worse or disappointing us.
---
&gt;I think most of the GW2 community 
---
Let's just give A.Net the benefit of the doubt and say that the majority of the GW2 community doesn't care about this content. They wouldn't just, for no apparent reason, stop making this content. I bet they have tons of internal data/analytics that show them that this type of content is just not popular with the majority of the playerbase, same goes for fractals, raids, dungeons and in a couple of months with strike missions.
---
and if it is as good as the prologue, they will.
---
so whats your (dumb) point again?
---
there are multiple. 
---
He also used Jokos magic to transform human souls he stole
---
You really want this barren plate of content be labeled and sold as "expansion" ? You think that releasing this as an expansion would make it less shitty?
---
Ok that sounds logical.
---
This seems most likely. 
---
People dont realize These "subfactions" are something completely new not only for us, but also for our characters.
---
But that makes a much sense as giving your dog kobe beef  
---
It's great, true, but your dog will waggle their tail just the same if you give them some cheap ass pork.   
---
The bottom lane in gw2 is exactly the same, you don't need good content to keep them in, just look at this patch  
---
there's literally nothing.   
---
the biggest upside is that there's a new launcher  
---
but people are still happy and keep saying that we should take a breath and be positive. Those people would be happy with tposing models because who needs animations
---
I don't see it 😐
---
no obsidian armor \*cough scrub \*cough
---
Raids in Gw2 are too hard to casual players. It's just a fact. But they're still justified because it's the content you can look forward to when you're a noob.
---
Of course Living World is bringing players. That doesn't mean that solo story-based missions is forever the way to go. It just means new releases bring players.
---
Yesss, thanks.
---
I've been wondering this, too. I've always bought the LW scrolls but there's no way I'm going to buy scrolls without a tome. I have wondered if for whatever reason they go into the season 4 tome but seeing as they probably don't, I don't really fancy taking my chances.
---
That makes sense.
---
Mostly just skins, but the kind of skins where you can actually trade them away and sell them. You know, like limited-time stuff that you can sell for more than you bought it later on, or prestigious stuff. Or skins in games where it's really fairly-priced and I'm enjoying the (F2P) game enough that I don't mind spending just a few times.
---
With Gw2, there's only so much non-cosmetic stuff they *can* sell because they don't want the game to be too P2W. But the cosmetic stuff is mostly pretty bad.
---
It's worth noting that with an F2P game, the average amount earned per player from purchases is somewhere between $5 and $20, depending on the game. But having whales is also important. Technically, if ANet makes more than $20 off you, they already won, but they're still making so much less off of us than they could be.
---
How can they fuck recycled content?
---
Please, if you never worked as a graphist etc dont assume you can evaluate the amount of work.
---
The source of my rant is that I logged in today like everyone to check out the stuff. After the first instance of pressing F on every corpse waiting for the slow dialogue to roll out I had enough. I then explored all areas in the new zone (unlocked them on the map, really) and I had enough.
---
This release is new by definition, but it still feels like there's nothing new.
---
But thats not true. (Except for mount Skins, fuck that implementation)   
---
People have been saying and debunking that myth for as long as the gemstore existed. Just look at the current update - weve had multiple new assets, completely new armor parts and a *full set* of double-skinned high quality weapons.   
---
Opposed to a pretty axe we already have a more extravagant form of and an outfit, maybe?
---
Chests are same rock-paper-scissors. You need to use the essence that is strong against the shield (so not the same one).
---
then you should read more
---
I do agree. Frankly the writing is awful. While not bad by mmo standards, there is this feeling of anet having being mismanaged and detached from the beginning. It not only is resource intensive to maintain the game in this way but it is also painful waste of potential for meaningful and repeatable content. The fire and forget mentality of anet shows they have no vision, nor do they listen to anyone. All the while keeping their lips sealed.
---
What do you mean by you can't find the instance?
---
Everybody was tired of dragons. We even finally had a reprieve where it seemed where we'd have a compelling villain in Joko and they killed him off way too soon as a "chess piece" for the real villain they wanted us to fight - another fucking dragon.
---
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
Be careful what you wish for because you CAN actually buy a raiding guild.
---
One idea I had about raid training would be: have two raid bosses per day with a daily reward, kinda like fractal dailies.
---
So you think the problem with the content is that it's not called an expansion?
---
When people are asking for an expansion they want an expansion not fucking living story. Calling it a saga didn't make it better, charging money for the same shit definitely won't either.
---
it checks out for at least 2 years now.
---
* Tier 1 lets you open small chests.

---
R beats G beats B beats R
---
its fucking foggy
---
My story tells me to board my flight to Grothmar Valley, but the instance that I saw in someones walkthrough is not here.
---
i dont think their mistake is choosing wrong words, but the lack of developing new exciting content, thats the core issue here
---
Did it 10 times in a row with the same group to try to optimize for time and we managed with about 1:45 left on the best-chest timer.
---
I think it is a mistake to talk about GW2 in  the same way as those games. The revenue from GW2 is closer to Aion, and you need to adjust your expectations a bit.
---
An easier way to remember the choices for the step you want may be binary. Mark first choice as 0, second as 1, then each result is numbered as follows:
---
result|binary|decimal
---
---|---|---

---
Grace of Dusk|110|6
---
Blessing of Twilight|111|7
---
oh and to actually give you an answer: the map, the story/atmosphere and the amsteries are on a expansion level. these points are on the same level as HoT or PoF.
---
Those are the other two strike missions, you will be able to in the following weeks.
---
The expansion worthy content was:
---
1. Ascended Cooking (monetized with garden plots btw)
---
2. Build/Equipment Loadouts (not templates, also monetized hyper-aggressively)
---
This is the future of Guild Wars 2 we have to look forward to, friend. Endgame is basically dead in the water because the casual majority won't set foot in that content.
---
So they went through all the trouble of adding arbitrary enemy factions with no real precedent, colour-coding them in the simplest and most unappealing ways possible for the dum-dums so there is absolutely no question about which one's which, and then in the end expect those same people to **play an in-game tutorial** and *remember the correct order of RPS* when there is no established lore to motivate it?
---
Why have everything glow in bright primary colours if matching them up is not the solution? It looks ugly, does not suit Jormag at all and anyone with half a brain cell doesn't need it to figure out/read up how the chests work.
---
Once per day only, probably.
---
I don't know why I am bothering to reply to you (I have you tagged as a shill for a reason after all)...
---
It really is a strawman argument, sorry if you are too stupid to see it!
---
&gt;A straw man is a form of argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent.
---
That is *literally* what he is doing. People are arguing this chapter was lacking in fun and meaningful content, and then he is pulling an argument out of his ass to argue against.
---
If I say this chapter was really short because the map was small and I finished the story in less than an hour, that *absolutely* isn't the same thing as comparing this to the intro quest of a game.
---
Adding 10 hours of braindead mindless farming for weapon skins isn't comparable to actual story content, or fun content.
---
no we just need to play a different game, how long can someone remain hopeful or delusional? i think this subreddit really reflects on that recently, there's mass disillusionment and I'm glad about it. we need to put companies to higher standards
---
It’s increased per daily. You get three chests instead of one. If you want more Mistborn Motes for some reason there are plenty of sources.
---
Got to have that sweet Eye of the North login music too.
---
yes, thats what he doesnt understand.
---
Mhh..did you try another character?
---
Usually, you have to go through a story step to get to a new location which you bypassed with the teleport to a friend item. You could try reactivating the story and see if that changes something.
---
You now get three per daily, even the most basic Bloodstone Fen ones.
---
playing since release and never noticed it.. thats quite devastating for their effort..
---
You don't even have to move through the map. As long as one person does and enters the instance, no one else needs to traverse the map.
---
Vigilance is strong against Resilience.
---
Resilience is strong against Valor.
---
Valor is strong against Vigilance.
---
it's 10€
---
Tried it, thanks for the tip :) But didnt help =(
---
or he just complaint without testing it.
---
Yeah, I will reserve my judgment until they show how frequent the releases are going to be.
---
I think some people are either burned out at this point so anything sets them off or have been in the outrage train for too long to know any better.
---
All this money from gem store sales, all this developer time from ending non GW2 products and cutting other areas of the game like raids while not developing a new xpac. 
---
I just don’t get it. What’s arenanet doing with their time/resources that warrants them not putting out more content than the bare minimum. Are they that badly mismanaged?
---
sure, so where is the expansion content each episode? im fine if one episode they add a guild hall, the other episode smth else etc
---
Imagine if the correct order was RGB, as are primary colors in the most used color system on Earth. Really hard to remember.
---
Because you have a history of attacking people who dont share your opinion. Didnt you get a temp ban for harassing people into telling them not to post or play if they dont enjoy (some aspects of) the game? 
---
I know it's a radical idea but telling anyone who criticises a part of the game to leave if they dont like it is toxic. Voicing criticism is not.
---
I also expect some fluff post from you a few days after anet has another pr or release debacle. Always fun to see.
---
I'm beyond pissed that she was killed off. Fucking bullshit, I tell you. BULLSHIT!
---
I've got it with the first random group from the lfg. That group had a chrono and druid, but good? Pf.
---
And I don't see a point in praising it in comparison to the first one. The first one was so bad, that this doesn't mean much. And btw, what happened with "gradually improving" strike missions? "The second phase" of a first strike missions is actually an openworld choya pinata, apparently.
---
I tried it just now, didnt think of that! But sadly it didnt work..
---
have you also tried replaying a different episode and then continue the prologue?
---
I would also try to leave Grothmar valley entirely for that. IIRC you have to go to the black citadel for that because there is a bit of dialogue you can listen to.
---
You can farm eternal ice on the new map and buy LS4 currency with it. I think this system makes both skyscale and Vision requirements easier. for 25 eternal ice (very easy t get, one node drops between 3 and 6) you can get 25 kralkratite or 10 of other currencies.
---
So you get three times per chest, and 12 x 3 = 36 while in old system you could get  28? Sounds liek buff to me lol.
---
People won't transition from SMs to Raids. They will just play SMs.
---
The strikes missions. The boss change weekly now.
---
Can you make a screen? With your story journal open and the quest in the right top corner visible?
---
Ill give it a shot, thanks!
---
Honestly, I do appreciate the new cadence... but I do also worry about Ep2 &amp; 3... On many games the post xmas content updates are lessor..... This is to be expected and actually OK... but ep1 could have used that excuse.
---
well, you have essence manipulation mastery and strike missions (replacement for fractals and raids). Do you expect new elite specs? You might to pay for those, if ever released new ones (perhaps with new episodes...).
---
Instead of one episode every 4 months, we now get half an episode every 2 months i guess.
---
I absolutely agree and when they confirm 1 dude is making the game alone I'll sing his praises to the high heavens.
---
Thanks for the awesome work!
---
Way to ignore their post and reassure your own.
---
Then go play a different game, I already do and that's why I can enjoy gw2 more than you I think :)
---
I don't know why people are so salty around here, but the answer is easy....Don't like it, don't play it. I have been playing GW2 for 5 and a half years, since season 2, and I really enjoyed everything. This episode was not much, in 3-4 hours of gameplay I explored me map, finished the story and completed half of the achis....but I still enjoyed it and I will keep enjoying it. I will farm eternal ice to buy LS4 currency for the Vision collection, I will do the meta and strikes, I will take nice screenshots around the map etc. Easy. I like GW2 because it is a casual game and it allows me to progress even if I have to do some overtimes, I have to spend time in family etc. If you have 12 hours free / day then maybe it is not a game for you, but even if I would play it for 12 hours, I would still have a lot of different cool things to do.
---
I think the ice giant thing that you have to hold back with the chains is pretty cool... but yeah the fact that every camp is the exact same is problematic considering how many of them there are (they also go really slow cause you have to sit there and wait for the battle plans to respawn with NOTHING ELSE  HAPPENING!).
---
Well, now you are way too pesimistic or just trolling. We know that Ep2 will be second half of this map so it will be in similar size, so there is zero reason to release it further than in January/february.
---
What annoyed me was that it was in the open-world, I couldn't even see her because people on mounts covered her, really ruined the moment for me. Character death should be instanced, especially one as significant as Almorra.
---
Dude, you still didn't pre-order EotN?
---
I see your point, I was disappointed when i finished most of the new map and story last night in a 3 hour session, but I think both expansions were solid, I've really enjoyed them. I just wish there was a chance we might get a third.
---
Have you played WoW?  Achievements are just that, achievement over challenging or tedious modes of play.  Defeating a boss in a time limit, hardmode, doing X amount of PvP games, etc.
---
&gt; If you have at least 1 stack of red essence, you can smash open green chests.
---
&gt; If you have at least 1 stack of green essence, you can smash open blue chests.
---
&gt; If you have at least 1 stack of blue essence, you can smash open red chests.
---
Ohhhh! I thought you need to fully stack it! Good to know.
---
/f
---
Actually the compressed daily was a thing players demanded on forum, it was not a random idea. I personally like the idea. The daily subtab was huge. Anway, the main reason you wound need to go on an old map is probably for map currency and I already presented you a solution to get a lot of map currency from LS4
---
Blue beats Red.
---
Red beats Green.
---
Green beats Blue.
---
Well, iirc it’s not “your” party in Fotm.  It was changed ages ago because things would happen where the “instance owner” would DC or log off and the rest of the group would be screwed.  They’d be unable to kick the “leader” and had to either 4 man or leave party and reform.
---
However, I agree that people who are blocked by anyone in a group should not be able to join a group from LFG.
---
The Balthazar fight is one of my favorite solo instances in the game. Lots of mechanics to avoid, easy to see for the most part, and different phases of the fight, that could easily be expanded into something fun for 5 players.
---
I'm playing since the beta without major breaks, I care about the game, but not about modes I don't play. If gw2 got more focused on raids I would have left, because I'm hear for the story and the world.
---
I have and it's not far off. This shit is done fast by 1 person especially if it's 2-3. 
---
It really wouldn't have hurt them to do the entire thing like for the xpacs considering how long this took. 
---
But since it seems the gw2 team is now 5 people all of them have to do all the ingame graphics aswell so no time for these unimportant things. If they do have more people then it's simply subpar (like the rest of this release).
---
Yes of course it is not a proof that they planned to make an expansion, that wasn’t my point.
---
But is interesting to see that they changed the launcher which they never did except for expansions.
---
Bags are rewards for holding the content
---
Now we have 1h of new content every 2 months.
---
No, no, you're doing it all wrong.  You have to make it 2000 gems so players have to spend extra.
---
Cant be worse than PoF
---
True, but the way I see it, even WoW devs need to work on both expansions and mid expansion releases to keep people playing. And WoW gets a steady stream of money from subscriptions and ingame store (very limited compared to the gemstore, but they do have some mount skins and services like server transfer etc). 
---
Didn't GW2 make the most money on expansion releases? I vaguely remember a graph showing it, but ofc I may be wrong,
---
I called it after the layoffs earlier this year. Friends were laughing calling me pessimistic. When they said no expansion will be coming, I called it. People said LW is a great format for releases. When I saw new weaponsets being reskins and low quality I called it. People were still in denial. When Mike left, I called it. People were calling me a drama queen, saying devs leave all the time.
---
It's as if you could push someones face into a shitpile and they'd still maintain that there is no shit.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Etherbound_Pauldrons - Same for the gloves and boots.  I find they dye really well with both loud and muted colors.
---
1 char lock but you gain more per 10k achivement points you have in game with special events throughout the year as part of the rewards - US only.
---
I don't know what you expect them to say. They've said practically nothing before, and they're certainly not going to now. I logged in for this episode for the first time in over a month. First time experiencing build templates, and still don't understand them or why they even exist. 
---
Played the story, and aside from being clueless in the Raven puzzle finished it in about 30 minutes. Started messing around with masteries which I already knew from the post were going to be disappointing, pointless, and highly overexaggerated in terms of value. Wound up being even more disappointed them than I anticipated.
---
It's sad. I used to love this game and have so much invested in it. But at this point, I'd almost rather just log in when the new episodes are released to have them unlocked and then play them in order all at once at the end of the season. It's just not enough getting these little scraps every 2-3 months.

And this patch was by far the smallest I've seen in a long time in terms of story. For them to state that this being a "saga" instead of a season means that we wouldn't always even get story content but sometimes quality of life updates, assumed that meant that the story focused updates would be far more robust. That having the map split up would mean the story and attention giving to the parts of the map we get would be far more detailed, but instead we get a fraction of the story and half of a map. 
---
I have to wonder if they've shifted a bunch of people off of development again, onto some other game. I had expected this episode to be smaller than the prologue, because the prologue was already largely underway before the layoffs, but this was definitely not what I was expecting. The tone was cool, and I like the direction they're going with the story, but if they keep delivering story at this rate with this small of delivery then it will likely be 2022 before this saga is completed. 
---
But that's probably the point of this new format - Rebranding it as a saga means we change our expectations for living world, which means they can stretch it out as long as they want. I highly doubt this game will ever see another expansion or any "expansion-level" features. And considering Strike Missions are a step down from Fractals and Raids which have pretty much been canceled, you can't really count Strike Missions as expansion worthy. They're just reiterations of existing features that have been scrapped for something with cheaper production cost. 
---
Since Season 4 it seems like it's been all about cutting as many corners as possible, imo. There have been a few great things scattered in between, but it definitely feels like the focus and passion is just gone.
---
And with all that free disk space after uninstalling, you can download even more practise tests! GL on the mid-terms my dude.
---
U did all the weapons and upgraded them too?
---
Errr... You can easily tell when someone is kp faking by gameplay.
---
I ask for 100 ess and one shot every single thing like... 95% of the time. If you think a 20 ess, 50 ess, 100 ess or 200+ ess players play the same you are deluded.
---
100 ess is not identical clown fiesta to 30. You clearly have no clue what you talking about. Also no, 3/4 of the cm players do not fake. Fakers are very easy to spot. Also: if theres just one person they are very easy to carry most of the time.
---
Will it even make it through this season? "SAGA". I mean at this rate, it feels like they're just striking out every attempt.
---
Fucking over people who leveled the wrong ones. If you actually needed the mastery for the strike itself, fine. This is just dumb.
---
I think I speak for the marjority of people when I say that anyone working in a similar fashion like Arenanet and having NO results at all done in 2 years would have been fired long ago.
---
Yip, and when I raised this on this sub it was totally downvoted by people that don't want to believe that the FURNACE TAKEN and "Anet are SJW cucks" sentiment that we see from streamers and the toxicity here actually has real world implications and leads to the harassment of people just doing their job.
---
There's are frequent patrol events in the forest that are made up of wargs.
---
I remember when they used to do massive updates every 2 weeks and people complained that the game was updating too quickly so they made the updates last a lot longer. It's just how games are sadly, story content isn't the #1 priority. 
---
FF14 is the same, the story is amazing but everything is done within 1-2 hours of updating the game.
---
so... its a feature, not a bug? eh wait a second... Petey!
---
Mass exodus of people from the studio is a clear sign of a sinking ship release didnt help quell that at all.
---
Yeah we totally haven't seen an uptick in developer communication regarding WvW and PvP balance recently...
---
Wait a moment.
---
People who complain don't actualy play game anymore.
---
But they look so bland and uninspired :/
---
so you dislike the free content? that sucks.
---
Our characters don't even seem to realize it themselves.
---
But they said it would be something to run away from and be afraid of in the open world -gags-
---
Especially because they first said this to GW2's 6th birthday almost 1.5 years ago now. And since then most people in the community are talking about Elite Specs. They had 1.5 years to clarify what they mean with "expansion worthy" features.
---
Why per week? You can get 12 chests per day from one daily season category and 24 from both and yes maybe it is 4 less but are taking the time in consideration it takes to do all 4 dailies for a map a day?
---
You haven't really explained how her death is porly written.
---
I really want an xpack this year Santa, pls... We've bought the gems, we've been good. Please bring us an xpack, ty
---
&gt; if only it didn't lead to confusion in PvE
---
As if you ever have a reason to target players in PvE. All support skills are AoE precisely so you don't have to.
---
&gt; Perhaps they can consider it for PvP or WvW, where you're unlikely to encounter champs/legendaries?
---
Now THERE it definitely can cause confusion. Might make you mistake players for veteran guards in WvW, for example. But as long as it doesn't affect tab-targeting priority, I agree, it would be kinda neat.
---
An hour*

It can only exist as long as nobody is watching.

You're arguing with one of the most annoying white knights on this sub.

Everyone here who is saying things like this clearly doesnt raid. And only do strikes like onces in a while otherwise you would what bs you talking.
---
 Everyone here who is saying things like this clearly doesnt raid. And only do strikes like onces in a while otherwise you would what bs you talking.
---
Saying something may happen isn't being in denial. You're saying you no the future I'm saying you don't. Too many people are too sure of themselves. For years people said there would never be mounts in this game. They were wrong. 
---
It's possible we'll get nothing. It's possible we'll get something. No one can really know before hand. Keeping an open mind is not being in denial. It's simply keeping an open mind. Something many in the community seems to have left behind.
---
&gt;  forced on the players by making them kill crazy concert goers 500 times and kill a burning bunch of sticks 10 time and killing 100s of devourer nests.
---
Lol, these are not forced. Only completionists and masochists would do these. By burning sticks you mean this charr statue? Doing this event 10 times is that much for you?
---
How come this thread isn't top spot, compared to the launcher crap. I haven't been able to log in and all I see while browsing were the negativity and launcher bull.
---
I don't need realistic sudden death in a story about magical dragons eating magic and giant lady cat gathering an army of humans, lolirats, fursuitters, alcoholics and vegetables to fight them, though. It's called fantasy for a reason.  
---
I also think this death just made it boring, not darker. Come on, they have Jormag shitting into people's heads, she was barely keeping it together since Dragonfall, and her "snapping" or whatever of the sort to turn on her allies/ you by some twisted corrupted logic would've been a lot darker and engaging. This? Just feels like a lazy killoff of an old yeller. Proverbial trip behind the shed, so to speak.
---
There is no way to make the core story harder, all you can do is report the bugs and hope for the best.
---
you came from wow and think gw2 gets good frequent updates? What?
---
Yup, this is actually one of my fav updates of this patch.  This also has an ability to help increase the number of people on the map of the day... also possible continue to flat out ignore maps... but still... at the very least don't have to look through a tab of 30 dailies anymore!
---
TL;DR: Us vs Them is the worst and also everywhere and it's the worst. Also, I rant incoherently for a while...in fact, it's mostly crazy ranting, but I'm too tired to edit it to a state of semi-coherence, so no worries if you only read this TL;DR that is ironically getting pretty long itself.
---
Not to defend OP, but I understand where they're coming from (although I can't really condone how they're acting). There are at least (and likely at most) a few people that are what OP would call "white knights," who, when seeing any criticism of the game or Anet (legitimate criticism or not), downvote, argue incessantly, shut down discussion and call dissenting opinions illegitimate, spout hyperbole, call names, claim they're the "true fans," say that hardcore players (whatever their definition is) aren't welcome/don't matter, etc.
---
If I had that pop up every time I expressed an opinion, especially if it's constructive feedback about a game I loved and wanted to see get better, I'd be pissed too (and in fact, that's often exactly the case), but it doesn't excuse acting just as badly. Hell, I can even understand some of the "white knights." If I had people complaining about people complaining about people complaining, I'd also be mad (of course the same thing about not excusing bad behavior applies).
---
But we all have to realize that the extreme camps, both of people against the game, people against people against the game, people against people against people against the game, and so on are small but very loud and active groups. Whereas on the other hand, those that love the game and want to see it get better and those that are okay with the current state of the game are drowned out by the more extreme groups, and even worse, are assumed by the other sensible group to be part of one of the extreme groups because the extreme groups are all anyone can hear. Then when they encounter another sensible person that disagrees with them, they've gotten so used to being yelled at every time someone disagrees with them that they react badly towards the other person. Or even worse, when they express an opinion, they've gotten so used to being yelled at that they prematurely act as if they're already being attacked (as may be the case with OP). Ideally, everyone could try to just be a bit more patient, withhold judgement for a bit, and give the benefit of the doubt.
---
I forgot what my point was. I'm just sick and tired of the Us vs. Them mentality (and especially the assumption that the other "side" is one homogenous group of the most extreme people outside your group) that always seems to arise in every community or discussion, from video games to politics to popular media (I wasn't a big fan of Star Wars: TLJ, but not because I thought it was radical feminist propaganda or whatever it is the alt-right seem to think) to underwater basket weaving to whatever. 
---
I've seen a similar situation happen so many times before, and I hate seeing it happen to one of my favorite games and what has been my favorite MMORPG since it launched.
---
Destiny 2 had an almost identical situation, albeit more extreme in some respects: great combat system and amazing potential, but bad communication from devs, not a lot of content (in GW2's case, this more applies to the amount of new content and how often it's released) and little replay value, alienated hardcore and even slightly-more-involved-than-casual players, most skins and effort seemed to be focused in the cash shop, etc., which caused the same sort of Us vs Them complex in the community. Both the Us vs Them complex ruining the community and the issues with the game and its management caused me to leave, which has been pretty much the case with GW2 (except I'll come back every few months to unlock and complete the next LS episode). On the bright side, Destiny 2 has managed to completely turn itself around, as has the community, and I hope the same happens to GW2.
---
While it was incredibly short all the way around, the story actually stirred a bit of hype in me that I haven't felt from GW2 in a very long time.
---
Grind those real life achievements!!
---
"You have been playing for 5 hours, please, take a break, lest something BAD HAPPENS."
---
Yes other people ran into that issue, if you would use the search function or scroll down on the hot page you would have seen it. What you can do? Waiting for anet to fix the bug, it has something to do with the fact that your husband as the other nodes.
---
I never said I'm struggling to deal with them though. I just said that T1 has nothing to do with quality of players, just the amount of them.
---
I think you missed the entire point of my post, friend.
---
You can't ultimately hate ANet for the content they put out, *because* it's free. You can't both demand the world and not pay a dime. They are a business, after all. I'm happy we agree on that.
---
The problem is that no one is objecting to paying for another expansion. Everyone who frequents this sub is invested enough in the game to want to be part of a larger community. Everyone here is prepared to hand over their hard-earned cash for Guild Wars 3, or the next expansion. I'm sure there are many more besides r/guildwars2 who feel the same way.
---
ANet themselves made the choice NOT to make a new expansion, sold us the idea of the Icebrood saga, assured us that it will be every bit as grand as an expansion and then under-delivered in almost every measurable way possible. 
---
We won't necessarily get new maps with each release, no legendaries are on the horizon, Fractals and raids are not planned for the future, the build templates won't be fixed until april of next year and we're being drip fed fractions of the kind of content we've been used to. We can't even expect the kinds of grand set-pieces they gave us from Season 4.
---
So yes, I dislike the free content, because they promised us it would be worth far more.
---
Each map has their own currency (chest). I mean 12 chests per week PER MAP. 
---
If we go by your logic then previously we could get 4(dailies)x6(maps)x2(seasons)=48 chests daily. That's exactly 50% loss, still.
---
Yes to both.
---
When does the Saga end? How long do I need to wait until I get expansion worthy content? Can I start playing the game after 2 years when the time gated story is finally done or is their intention that the player needs to log in every 2-3 months to enjoy 2 hours of subpar story? What is expansion worthy content? Cooking 500, Build Loadouts? Achievements? Or maybe strike missions which are basically raids/meta events? 
---
Give us elite specs, new races, new classes, armor and weapons which are on the same level as gem store skins
---
It is short, yes, but, at least in my opinion (and experience as a low FOV player who tries to get immersed into the story), it was pretty good. Yes, there were no big fights, but ANet set the sense of dread and danger quite well, both in the first and in the last instance.
---
That said, we could have used some more content, like new events in the Open World maps, just like the Suspicious NPCs that appeared in the Shiverpeak maps before the Prologue was released. I mean, there's a ton of stuff they could have done in addition to the episode itself, but the episode itself was quite decent... It needs a harder final boss, though.
---
It takes less time but is only possible to do once (or 2 times once every 6 weeks) per week. It's limiting no matter how you look at it. 
---
Dailies are purely optional. Nobody forces you to do them. Actually, nobody forces you to play games at all. If they wanted to reduce the clutter in daily page, there were other options to do so. 
---
Reducing currency gain in a game designed to farm 5329520 different currencies is a bad change.
---
&gt; just to find out i didnt like the class so much after all.
---
this is basically what could happen with any profession though. But even if you don't like the profession or how it is played in the end don't view it as wasted time because you learned something about this profession and the game again.
---
&gt; Where can i learn more about builds? I dont plan on doing dungeons or raids i just wanna do events and world bosses.
---
If that is the case then just reading through the skills and traits and picking those things that have some synergy will be enough for you. You are only level 17 with that profession so you shouldn't just worry about what is the best build or which skills and traits to pick because someone else said so.
---
When you read those things and try the out you will learn more about them and are way more invested in the character and how it is being played because you know what those skills do and how you could apply them. When you just use a build from the build websites you will only know how to use them but not why those skills and traits were chosen in the first place. And while those builds will probably fit most situations you could also encounter things that it doesn't handle well. If you know which skills to switch to, then you will be able to react easier to changes.
---
&gt; Is there any way for me to test out what a class will be like at lvl 80? Like a Public Test Server or anything?
---
Not precisely. You can, however, go into PvP and test the skills and traits out but you will have different numbers because of some skill split between PvE and PvP.
---
Woah that's a lot of research, since no one else has said anything yet - thanks for taking the time to piece that together and also write that up!
---
What i said multiple times to the first strike mission is that you can't fail it. Pressing 1 and in rare casing pressing F.  
---
Everyone were able to finish it without any skill requirement.
---
For the new one i went there with the mentality i achieved after playing the first one.  
---
So i just took the character i did the Story with and joined a public lobby and wiped in the most unspectacular way possible.
---
Tried it again same result. The Problem i realized is that ppl are dieing in the aoes and can't be ressed by one person alone.
---
Third try another public group this time i brought a heal scourge to drag all the dieing ppl out of the aoes. That time it worked till we killed the first Boss and wiped to the second enraged Boss.
---
Fourth try same start different group with focus on killing both at the same time worked just fine.  
---
I still wouldn't call it difficult some phases feels like there is a lot of incoming dmg tho like the cc phase which seem to require good cc or a healer (haven't had enough time to play around with that mechanic yet)
---
You are totally right with an organized group especially raiders this is faceroll and it wont really interest raiders.  
---
You missed the entire point of strike missions tho. It isn't supposed to be raid content it's supposed to be an entrance to raid content for ppl that never raided before and it kinda fulfill that role this time.
---
they fired so much people we should be glad they're still releasing stuff.
---
how low we've fallen.
---
Right now I can expect anything from anet
---
Why? Clearly they set a bar they can't reach, so the game enters hybernation. They won't level with you, or us. Not the proper way anyway.
---
I'd just rather see the glass half empty and be happily surprised :)
---
I got tired after 1500lis, strike missions are refreshing.
---
Yes they are optional and there are other ways to get the currency, ways were you get even more then from a daily.
---
Maybe try doing it with someone else? I'm online in a minute so could party up and do it on mine, you should still get completion for it
---
We need something like this here, in reddit. Everytime you post something, you can hear:
---
"Your opinion doesn't matteeeer"
---
"Noone cares"
---
"Your complaining won't change anything"
---
Weird, mine tends to fill it self back in after a few seconds
---
&gt;I'm hear for the story
---
Well that's what I said.
---
Yeah, nothing i'm looking for.
---
&gt; only log in for 2 to 3h every 3 months to play
---
what Anet has accomplished with Saga Epi(demic)sodes (being released in between festivals), is right there in your statement. That being, giving players a reason to log-in more often (each month, if you include festivals). This leads to, potentially, more money being poured into the game.
---
You can look at this as a very well disguised monthly sub.
---
Fuc* raids!
---
That's one new 2000gem background every two weeks for the next three years!
---
My dear friend, at this point, them ALLOWING me to pay for an actual expansion is a gift in my eyes. That's how bad it got....
---
I was ready to get my pitchfork...
---
SAB is April so May!!
---
Maybe because it's not made for raid capable people?
---
Why are u all still playing? Just leave and let the others have fun
---
Jormag is an ice queen tsundere archetype.
---
Next episode: "Baka Champion, it-it's not like I like you or anything. I just helped you because it was to my advantage."
---
Yes, good job explaining something so obvious even the rocks in the room understood it and does not actually adress any of the criticisms stated.
---
We got that jormag was puppeting her corpse. How exactly does that change the fact that it was an unceremonious offscreen death of a very long term character purely for shock value that didn't enchance the story in any way, threw away potential, and we could have done entirely without?
---
But only every 6th day. So you will have to do 1/6 of work for 3x the rewards. More time to actually visit some other maps in meantime.
---
Strike missions are just fractals with a different name and less content. 
---
The Icebrood Saga is just the Living Story with a different name.. and less content.   
---
ALSO,   
---
ArenaNet: Releases new story episode. 
---
Community: OMG NEW LAUNCH SCREEN AND THEY MADE THE ROLLER BEETLE LESS TERRIBLE.   
---
It's almost as if really basic and easy to make quality of life features are overwhelmingly more exciting than story content which takes months to make and will be played in under a few hours then never touched ever again.
---
Because anyone can play, and have fun. Why are you still commenting? Just leave and let others have fun.
---
It is sad how true this is. Thumps up from me. On the feedback in this reddit alone i am more and more unmotivated to even start this new chapter because as it sounds, it is more an appetizer than a true continuation. i think i will wait for the february episode to come to have a more worhtwhile session
---
You also get endurance back for crashing while boosting. Don't know what they were thinking.
---
Expansion worthy content should be monetized, meaning you pay for it, what exactly did you pay for to get this release?
---
Reading is hard.
---
&gt;Jormag plays big game here.
---
Everyone and their mother knows that the "whispers" are jormag's voice at this point. Both the characters and the players. There's no suspence or mystery.
---
Unless they're gonna decide to control+C -&gt; Control+V modremoth's power and give him straight up mind control (Which I wouldn't put it above them), there's literally no suspence because everyone can just ignore the whispers and any character who follows them would only do so due to holding the idiot ball.
---
Geez, seems pretty rough getting downvoted for expressing a desire to support the game monetarily after a good update.
---
"Instead, our motivation has to be provide players with such an amazing experience in the game that they **want to keep playing** it"
---
Colin's words to IGN in 2013. Apparently it is difficult to stick to those words.
---
Nice anecdote tho, it reminds of MikeO making a similar one. It was an expac leaks related.
---
Exactly this.
---
I wish they would use handles that indicates their role in the team.
---
So, we're just going to bitch about free content?
---
Was about time to change it :)
---
I wasnt even talking about other patches, and even there youre wrong in all aspects except that the gemstore products are more flashy
---
And yet here I am, a color blind player, looking at all this nonsense.
---
You have to log in to find something to criticize, now you're telling me there is no point in even doing that?
---
Literally impossible to finish the entirety of the patch considering 2/3 strike missions aren’t available yet
---
&gt; You claimed with certainty that "Nobody cares" about raids, and yet ou weren't aware of the biggest raiding event that happened 3 months ago drawing massive nearly unprecedented twitch viewership for gw2 that nothing else ever had.
---
This is a *game,* not a TV show, Twitch viewership is completely irrelevant. I never said you couldn't get people to watch raids on Twitch, I said that *players* don't give a shit. 
---
&gt;It was a raiding event that happened about 3 months ago that drew massive positive attention and unprecented twitch viewership that gw2 had rarely if ever seen before outside announcements.
---
Again, irrelevant. Also, for the record, the numbers the Divinity's Reach Cat Show bring in on Pinterest are also not relevant. 
---
&gt;Blish's sacrifice was pointless because anet decided to bring back aurene with superpowers undermining the meaning of sacrifice in the entire season.
---
Aurene has nothing to do with Blish. Blish sacrificed his life to get you the information that you needed. Aurene just died due to random happenstance, that wasn't really any sort of "sacrifice." Besides which she was always going to be a messiah figure, so anyone that didn't expect her to come back was an idiot. 
---
&gt;Why even make it a mastery?
---
Why not? It gives players a little something extra to do, but is not so onerous that anyone rational would get bent out of shape over it. 
---
&gt;You do realize that we're past the prologue right?
---
We're past the trailer, we're past the prologue, we're now past the first 20-30 minutes of a movie. There is still a LOT to go. Maybe when the season's over, you'll feel the same way about it you do today. Maybe you'll feel even worse. But maybe you'll like it more than you expected. I can't say, I doubt you will like it, because I doubt it'll offer you any of the things you seem to want, but I do think that most GW2 players will enjoy it. 
---
&gt;Legitimate what are you expecting them to do at this point?
---
"Offer expansion worthy content," *over* the course of the entire season. I have NEVER expected that they would dump an entire expansion into this one episode.
---
&gt; Timegated bosses do not increase content value
---
I see time gating as an artificial way of extending a smaller amount of content.
---
I picked it up at my local library like... uh, 10 years ago? Definitely didn't finish the whole series though. You, me and OP! :P
---
This hardly affects beetle races though cause you're mounted the whole time?
---
Green&gt;Red&gt;Blue
---
&gt; Twitch viewership is completely irrelevant. 
---
lmao, is this how far you're gonna go to white knight for anet? To pretend that the biggest game streaming platform on the planet that practically makes or breaks games is "irrelevant" to your game?
---
Dude, remove anet's cock from your mouth, the lack of oxygen is causing you brain damage. 
---
Your comments keep getting more and more asinine as time goes on. Take a step back and watch how stupid the shit you're saying is for a second.  You're claiming every single fuckup since (and including) the announcement doesn't mater, you pretend afk exp grind masteries is content, you pretend TWITCH is irrelevant to a game's success.
---
Try and look at the shit you're saying with an objective perspective for a second.
---
Could be your GPU I read that it struggles DX9 games for some reason
---
The first time i did Jormag was amazeeee
---
The problem wasn't the map-wide metas requiring too much coordination or skill. It was a mix of the rewards not being worth it, the participation meter system requiring you to be farming events well before the main meta if you want any good rewards from the meta (plus it all being reset if you change maps, even temporarily, or are disconnected), map completion being locked behind the metas, and the fact that all four maps were fully meta-based (instead of a mix of meta-based and more traditional maps).
---
If it was the metas being too hard or requiring too much coordination, I don't remember any change that tried to accomplish that, just changes that tried to accomplish the rest of the aforementioned issues, especially from the [big HoT meta update,](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2016-04-19#Heart_of_Maguuma_.E2.80.94_Rewards_and_Experience) which improved the rewards, made the participation meter only apply to the main meta (which helped a bit with the meter reset issue and lack of traditional maps as well), and iirc, made map completion easier/possible in most cases without doing the meta. The only coordination/difficulty change I saw was for the events in Verdant Brink where you really need to spread out and might even end up doing alone. Although maybe there's another update that notably toned down the difficulty and made coordination less necessary, but I don't remember it nor could I find it.
---
Besides, the concept of map-wide coordinated metas clearly isn't a HoT-only thing, nor is it something that was abandoned afterwards. Silverwastes is quite possibly the most popular map in the base game, and Anet themselves direct newer players to it by having the level 80 boost NPC there and letting them preview level 80 while in the map without spending their boost. 
---
Plus there have been map-wide coordinated metas since HoT, like Serpents' Ire and the Maw of Torment in PoF, Thunderhead Peaks (at least the south meta needs a bit of coordination), and most recently Dragonfall, which was a decent mix of Silverwastes and Dragon's Stand, although could've used more in the lead-up to the final assault (especially after all three camps are at max level) and a bigger payoff in the final event than popping crystal zits on Kralk's back and fighting branded bosses we've already beaten in other maps/episodes, then just watching Kralk shield up. Man, imagine if we got to go down into the cave with his head and fight that instead of just branded and zits.
---
"Volume too low" ahahah so true.
---
[You dense...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/013/005/3mLydMU.png)
---
The fact episode 1 is shorter than the prologue... how did so many months translate into 2 gameplay hours?
---
If they didn't do that I think one can easily create a module for blishhud for that. Just data mine the voice files.
---
all that writing just to say "yes, i dislike free content"
---
T\_T I feel your pain! I never had the pleasure of playing GW1 so areas like Cantha are a true fantasy for me. I want to see the Tengu as a race. I want to explore the mysteries surrounding the unending Ocean and explore more of Tyria! The world is so big, they could go any number of places and we'd all love it. 
---
ANet, you know it makes sense!
---
And yet there was a lot of critique for the way they handle character deaths (caving in to crowd voices in case of Trahearne, Belinda and Demmi offing, outcry after 'War Eternal' first moments). They decided to go that way; some people will feel it doesn't fit their previous sunshine and rainbows Tyria, but Anet already told us, there is going to be more of the grim and Lovecraftian horror story this time. And yes, this means death will be portrayed as what it really is. The piles of corpses of our allies in the keep was something they also pulled first time, I think.
---
The best request for this update so far. I'll second that. Hands down. ANET notice this sempai!
---
Unfortunately for you, the "don't like it then don't play it" argument falls apart the moment enough people stop playing the game. An MMO can not survive with enough people, so if enough people follow your advice, not even you can play the game anymore.
---
Tl;dr - Your advice is a clear-cut road fpr you to not being able to play the game yourself.
---
call it as you wish. I will  make it clearer for you, this subreddit is not satisfied with the direction the game is going.
---
Fractals are much harder than strike missions. 
---
Strike are just the new world boss without the zerg.
---
Your comments keep getting more and more asinine as time goes on. Take a step back and watch how stupid the shit you're saying is for a second.  You're claiming every single fuckup since (and including) the announcement doesn't matter, you pretend afk exp grind masteries is content, you pretend TWITCH is irrelevant to a game's success.
---
Try and look at the shit you're saying with a non white knight perspective for just a minute and see how stupid it is.
---
Beetle fix is a fix but was a life changer to me
---
It's on the vendor for me. I do have the Grothmar home instance node but the one from the trading post, not from the vendor. Perhaps that's why it's not there for some people.
---
Negative subreddit is precursor to dead subreddit.
---
0.9 is rounded up to 1. Sure if you want to nitpick, I didnt complete the entire patch, since I am artificially forced to not be able to complete it.
---
Sort by new and watch a post made 5 minutes ago get downvotes, whether it be negative or positive, constructive or otherwise; it will be downvoted.
---
Who wants to engage in a community where your opinion is literally buried within the first 5 minutes? Maybe it evens out because there's barely *any* new posts being made that even posts with zero upvoted go to the front page; the only other place I've seen that happen is on the MMORPG subreddit, so that should tell you much of what you need to know about the toxicity rampant in this subreddit.
---
I like your attitude.
---
uhm, the joke was that there will be nothing between 8.3 and shadowland. no content whatsoever besides scheduled events. (and pre events a month before release)
---
You do not need any creativity in school. All you have to know is how to apply the scientifically established tools the school tries to teach you. No proofing or inventing new ways of solving. 
---
--- 
---
Are you drunk?
---
One raid release being delayed to its own release does not a dedicated release schedule make.
---
The PvP comment was spot on as for builds
---
Check out these sites

Snowcrows for raids

Discritize for fractals

Gods of PvP for PvP

And Metabattle for open world

&gt;&gt;You're repeating yourself, asked and answered.
---
&gt;So, are you aware of the definition of insanity yes or not?
---
Yes, you repeating yourself, expecting different results.
---
&gt;Yes, and I'm asking if you found all 30 minutes of it enjoyable.
---
Took me closer to two hours, all told, and yeah, it was mostly fun. I'm still not sold on these Essence things, but the maps got some cool style to it, and I thought the story was quite well done. I think if I had any complaints about the story, it would be that the character death in the middle wasn't delivered as effectively as it might have been, but it's always a bit tricky in an MMO engine. 
---
&gt;But I thought renue was stable :thonk:
---
Revenue is stable, but in case you didn't hear, the studio itself lost a bunch of staff. It's unclear how much of that was GW2 staff. 
---
&gt;They're objectively producing lesser and shittier content than past releases. This episode has a shorter story, shorter map, no legendary, no fractal, no raid, and no unique mechanic (like suns refuge).
---
First, "no legendary, no fractal, no raid," good. That would all have been a waste. 
---
Second, yeah, this episode is short. That, in and of itself, is not great. If every episode is the same, and there are the same number of episodes, and there are no other shoes to drop, then I am right there with you, "sucky season." 
---
I am just not making the same assumptions you seem to be. The thing is, they could have made this chapter longer, but how? If we assume the same start and stop, where would you have added story? I can't think of any place that *meaningful* story could be added. It would all be padding, like pointless mob clearing duty. I don't think there are any significant story beats they missed within the bounds of this episode. So I actually appreciate that they didn't pad it out. Now that said, I do expect other episodes to be longer, or for them to add more story content in between episodes. As I noted elsewhere, there would be space here for them to have a personal story involving Marjory that we could get into until the next release. If all chapters are this long, and there are only six of them, then that would suck, but there's no reason that later chapters couldn't be longer, or there could be more of them in the same amount of time. 
---
Likewise with maps, this one is small, but would it have benefited from padding it out? From making it "just bigger" and adding more stuff? Maybe, but what if instead they are spending that time making a later map, one with more interesting terrain, or in a more interesting part of the story, even bigger? 
---
The second episode of the Mandalorian was relatively short, and this apparently upset some people. I liked it, because I felt it was "the right size for that story." Don't waste my time, do what needs doing.
---
&gt;Any person with average intelligence has the ability to discern patterns. Anet's been shitting the bed for the past 2 seasons.
---
I liked last season. You didn't, that doesn't mean you're right. Most players thought the Prologue was great. Most agree that this episode was short, but if later episodes are longer, all will be forgiven there. If you didn't like last season, then I think the chances are pretty low that *you*'ll like this season, but that doesn't mean that *the players* won't enjoy it, because, as you said, you "only play for 2 hours per patch," whereas most *players* play for significantly longer than that.
---
Very mature and reasonable. 
---
I see lots of people run PoF armour sets, especially Requiem and Mistbound ones - both full, 3 weight armour sets with two versions each part, introduced with LS Patches.
---
I am going to go with yes. It is 100% of the reason I don't check here nearly as often as I used to.
---
So you and your 20 asshole friends (because if you fake you are an ass) are somehow 75% of the playerbase LOL?
---
ALSO you claim someone that did the fractal 3 times nails all the mechanics and ourperforms someone who ran it literally HUNDREDS of times?
---
Btw i have linked 3 ess a few times (hey guys i'm new but i watched a youtube guide)... That doesnt mean i'm actually a 3 ess player.
---
They fucked up the announcement, they fucked up templates, the prologue was mediocre, their idea of "expansion worthy content" is ascended cooking and now they fucked up this release as well.
---
You'd think fuckup after fuckup after fuckup would tick people off. How many times do they need to screw up in a row until people catch on that there is no messiah that will suddently fix everything coming?
---
Map is wonderful. Dark with blizzards and with lots to explore . Story is short and with stupid walks but it is well written.
---
We do not need other legendaries
---
I hope all the raids will be changes into strikes and if a new fractals means a new siren's reef I say no ty
---
New reward/collection that requires both sm and raid kills would help a lot in motivating more people to try
---
Yea, I am not looking forward to this saga. I mean we have the good Charr getting 'killed off' while 'EVIL CHARR' are gonna be bosses again.
---
Why not have actual Norn story that we deserve instead of adding Charr to a story they barely have any involvement in? 
---
So Bandar's insane idea is ''there is a good Elder Dragon so Charr can't be evil in the future. Need an EVIL Elder Dragon to subdue to counter it''. THIS is the fucking premise of the saga? Not the fact that ''Norns lost all their lands and most of their spirits. Time to finally get revenge and take back their home is now!''
---
Seriously, my Norn character felt always out of place in most of the stories and the most involved saga he should be in, involves Charr... WHY?!
---
Where's the paid content at, bud?
---
Doesn’t feel finished 
---
Perhaps Jormag will use Zhaitan magic to raise her and make her a leader of his army because she led the Vigil? 
---
Rurik vibes?
---
Alright. So are you saying that you do not need Expansion to play the newest content? That would mean it is free. 
---
If you are required to buy something, it means content is not free. ICEBROOD SAGA is LOCKED behind PATH OF FIRE.
---
As long as no prober ingame Squad creator (something that guides a player by hand and has several options for group creation unlike current outdated LFg) exists SMs will never lead the majority into raids. Considering that ArenaNet isn't even focusing on raids and have to remanage themselfs I think that they do not care at the moment. I think because of their obvious financial restructuring their plan might be to get rid of raids (costs too much atm) and focus on SM only as the new casual catering mode. Which is fine for them because even veterans seem to play those. It makes sense because the mode reachs more players than raids.
---
Wow has a monthly fee. Gw2 has none.
---
6 times compared to a single episode of a living story ... 
---
Why do you Al keep saying the same stuff? Aren't you bored?
---
Yeah... no content because you played for 12 hours straight. I’m on the fence that from a pure gameplay side that ep1 was at most a 2 hour campaign. I haven’t done all the upgrades to my mastery yet. If you’ve sunk 12 hours into it ON RELEASE... that’s on you. Where the heck did you get 12 hours anyways on a WEEKDAY?
---
That's a terrible way to look at it. Most of this sub would actually pay money for good content.
---
That's what they said is new practice from so onwards...
---
I use firefox at home, unfortunately I was at work sneaking on the wiki. It's either chrome or IE.
---
But from what I can see via peoples  comments. The API code can only be stored via browser  auto fill/cookies and not added to your wiki account. 
---
Thanks :)
---
I see it's just general complains like old men with a quarter of red wine . It is not something is not good, it is just complaining for the fun of doing it.
---
How do we know? the closest thing they said on the matter was they had that option, they never said they were definitely going to do it. Besides assuming they were to decide to actually not release a new map with every release what do you think would happen? the 100s of people and the 100s of man hours it takes to make a new map would just be wasted? do you think they'll like take the 2 months off for that release? No of course not they're redirect that man power into other content types of course like creating more story for that release or more content in the existent map which personal I like the idea as well. 
---
Yeah people asked for more content but just cause people ask doesnt mean anet can magically provide, clearly they had their budget slashed hence the layoffs how are they supposed to create extra content on top of their previous content. Its not like they were purposefully holding back. Only thing they can do is effectively release content more frequently so that players get less down time!
---
That living world content was bad in the past is your opinion which you're perfectly entitled to of course but doesnt mean its generally shared by everyone. I like the living world design both in terms of story, exploration, content and how its made repeatable and I am sure I am not the only one. You have to understand different people like different things, for some repeatable content is a dungeon they get to grind in order to get that latest gear set which keeps them busy till the next release. Thats perfectly fine ofcourse but some of us, or well I can only speak for myself so in my case thats not something I enjoy. I like that in gw2 each map has its own rewards and none of them are time bound because that allows me to vary it up as much as I want. I have the entire world to play in and no content ever runs out. You say its not repeatable or a lazy grind, yet for me its the exact opposite, a dungeon is more of a lazy grind, takes a lot less work to create than an open map. Has a lot less enemy variety and no quests/dynamic events at all (well this might depend on the game but in any case it defintiely has a lot less then an a map) but whats worst its timeboxed. I have to do it from when its released to when the next dungeon is released because one i need that gear for the next dungeon but also because that dungeon will become nearly useless after the next dungeon releases. Where as the opposite is true with Anet's model I am missing some of the minis from lake dorik? well havent played that in a while lets go for it, doesnt matter it was released years ago. Even if you earn all the rewards from an old map it still make sense to do it one for the season's global currency but also from the maps local currency because good chance a future reward like say a new legendary weapon or mount or whatever may very well require some item that is bought with that local currency. Again I get it for some people living world is just not for them, they run through it once and just forget about it, they see it as a handful of hours in terms of engagement. Yet for some of us, its actually endless and while like I said I cant speak for others, I see other players on any map I play hence I know I am not the only one who feels that way.
---
Two words:
---
Prepare earlier.
---
I hate to complicate your simplified world that was so appealing to you, but the people who complain are the ones who care. You can only be disappointed by the persons and things you love and care about. So it's likely that the players who play and love this game complain about it too.
---
Here it is. This is what drove them to focus on large repeatable open world events for loot. Champ trains. Dynamic event chains. Etc. Our behaviour drove them to develop content that further encouraged our behaviour. It evolved this way naturally.
---
They know what the players are doing and they use this to drive their decision making. Plain and simple.
---
why are you even doing those dailies? why is anyone? sure a bit of extra currency is nice when that currency is still relevant, but like "they're the easiest to do at the shortest amount of time" *to what end?* to achieve or progress towards *what?*
---
UM? just farm the berries
---
XP? just kill a handful of mobs
---
karma? *meh*
---
and they don't give any achievement points. all they were was UI bloat. genuinely curious what your motivation was assuming you didn't only recently decide to complete 3 year old content.
---
and as others have said, and that goes for everyone, do everyone including yourself a favour and read patch notes.
---
Indeed. I will never understand why companies do this.... community managers should be engaging.
---
Thank you; I did feel it was worth a share, when it suddenly clicked that I'd felt something like this before... 
---
I know that ANet had huge layoffs, and that they cancelled projects in the pipeline to focus more on GW2. I get that they are a business and at the end of it all, the company needs to turn a profit.
---
Despite this, it feels like the core focus of the game has become *just* about the money. Whenever this happens, the game loses focus and it spirals out of control. 
---
Why bother implementing something unless it has a tangible, financial return for the game? Fixing build templates right now will mean repricing them on the gem store - no point in doing that while there are still uninformed players buying extra slots.
---
Why bother fixing old content like legendary runes and updating old dungeons when new content will bring in money? 
---
The Gem store is still hilariously the only part of the game that is always updated with tonnes of many various and meaningful items.
---
The quote you linked just rings back to a time when there was still a lot of passion for the game. Yes, during Colin's time, we had content droughts and we hadn't figured out the correct format for Living World, but the quotes nowadays feel so prepared and devoid of any heart.
---
It is not. But PvP is dead and full of bots.
---
Just do your fight without thinking too much about it
---
Why this comment section make me wonder if the game worth to come back or not ..
---
&gt; Yes, you repeating yourself, expecting different results.
---
So, when anet keeps fucking up over and over (the templates, the cooking, the prologue, the announcement, episode 1, 80% of season 5) why are you all of a suddent expecting a different result?
---
&gt;Revenue is stable, but in case you didn't hear, the studio itself lost a bunch of staff. It's unclear how much of that was GW2 staff.
---
They still have over 200+ employs and they confirmed that the stuff lost was working on other projects and whomever left was moved to gw2.
---
&gt;First, "no legendary, no fractal, no raid," good. That would all have been a waste.
---
ERP demonstrates that you're full of shit, so the more you keep repeating that, the more you show that you're intentionally ignoring reality.
---
&gt;I am just not making the same assumptions you seem to be. The thing is, they could have made this chapter longer, but how? If we assume the same start and stop, where would you have added story? I can't think of any place that meaningful story could be added.
---
So, maybe rewrite the story? This is your sticking point? "Where could they have added story"?
---
Are this unimaginative?
---
&gt;Likewise with maps, this one is small, but would it have benefited from padding it out? From making it "just bigger" and adding more stuff? 
---
Would the content have benefited by having more content? Yeah gee man its a mystery. Nobody ever benefited more content.
---
&gt;Maybe, but what if instead they are spending that time making a later map, one with more interesting terrain, or in a more interesting part of the story, even bigger?
---
&gt;The second episode of the Mandalorian was relatively short, and this apparently upset some people. I liked it, because I felt it was "the right size for that story." Don't waste my time, do what needs doing.
---
After 5 years anet does not get the benefit of the doubt.
---
&gt;I liked last season. You didn't, that doesn't mean you're right.
---
You're free to like trashfires, nobody said you aren't, but content wise last season was not good. It had some highlights, but most of it was just mediocrity to hold us over until an expansion that never came.
---
&gt;Most players thought the Prologue was great. Most agree that this episode was short, but if later episodes are longer, all will be forgiven there. 
---
How many times does someone need to shit in your mouth until you close it?
---
&gt;whereas most players play for significantly longer than that.
---
The new patch literally does not have enough content to play for longer than two hours.
---
There's gonna be a 8.3.5, even tho it won't be a major content patch, it would still have more new content and changes.
---
Margarine &gt; butter
---
Not everything is black and white in the world bud. Thanks for reading though.
---
Gemstore.
---
But it's a really bad solo RPG. In all aspects; story, graphics, challenge, depth of mechanics, enemy variety and complexity and so on. What GW2 as any other MMO shines in is its group content and its world. Without it falls short. 
---
When stressed for time games like Witcher and Hollow Knight, or any new good game has much more value for your time imo.
---
You can make a free account. Go make one and if you can access this "saga" for free, I'll send you a precursor of your choice.
---
With Silverwastes being praised as an example of a map that was great after ArenaNet expanded on it, so it's exactly what so many people wanted :)
---
Can you play it without pof?
---
I finished the episode before I finished my beer.
---
You got new launcher, right? What do you want more?
---
I am working in game industry as a programmer. I might not be a graphists, but I work and cooperate with them on daily basis and I wait for their work to finish quite often - I know their deadlines and how much +/- it takes to do basic things. It's not 3d model with animation. It's a damn 2d image. Good graphist will make this in max 1-2 hours - if they know exactly what they need to do. I added extra 3 days and a few hours for meetings with boss/coworkers/clients, presenting their work, applying needed fixes and assuming at least 5 different versions are created and only 1 is picked as a winner.
---
IIRC they addressed this with one update. The problem is that this player needs to leave for some time to be counted as them leaving the match and the rest of the team not being affected by it.
---
However, the system can't really distinguish between someone who leaves on purpose or the connection being disrupted so it has to wait a certain time period so that those who are not failing the team have a chance to get back and not getting dishonour in the process.
---
Then again, the player could also join the game on purpose without you noticing and disconnecting again just to be a dick about it and also making it so that you lose the rating. People go through a lot just to annoy other players.
---
Lol some people got no life
---
&gt; The difference is some of us are waiting for this episode to come out pinning all our gaming on this episode. I'm doing other stuff in addition to the episode. I don't stop working on other stuff, so a shorter episode doesn't phase me one way or another.
---
I gotta say, "I like the episode because I actually have stuff to do outside the episode" isn't exactly a ringing endorsement.
---
For the time it takes to finish it, daily it would be too rewarding for a SM. Maybe timegshed for 48h or 72h I don't know. 3 days. Would be acceptable.
---
The main problem is the community has turned into an expert player so most of the content is doable and "achievable" in a few hours of playing.
---
... There is no challenge.
---
First they came for the dungeons, and I did not speak out, because I was not a dungeon runner. Then they came for the WvWers, but I did not speak out, because I was not a WvW fan. Then they came for ESPORTS and SPVP and I did not speak out, because I was not a SPVP fan. Then they came for raids, and I did not speak out, because I was not a raider. Then they came for Fractals and I did not speak out, because I did not do fractals.
---
Then they came for the Living World, and there was only Gem Store left to speak for me.
---
~Epitaph of a nameless White Knight
---
Season 5 was announced like half a year before the lay-offs though.
---
Oh that's awesome. I was definitely noticing a pattern but couldn't quite figure out what it was.
---
&gt; It's certainly important to some games, like Fortnite, but GW2 is a game to be played, not a game to be watched. 
---
Every single game is meant to be played you absolute mong. 
---
Twitch drives intrest for the game. It drives intrest for any game.  It shows engagement and acts as advertising and marketing.
---
Are for you real?
---
&gt;The best parts of GW2 are the worst parts to watch, because from the outside it just looks like a chaotic mess. 
---
So, why did the ERP event break gw2 viewership records?
---
Can confirm and I'm beyond casual.
---
No. School is what it is. It is not university. School is giving you tools to work with. You do not have to proof some old hypotheses again or have to know how that old mathematician has constructed that formula. You just use that formula without having to know anything about its origin or how a tool came to be. It's fucking easy to get good grades in school with the right mindsets. Of course I overexagerated 'no creativity'. But yes.
---
Less content at every content release..
---
The studio still have plenty of people working on..
---
It become more &amp; more obvious that they work on some hidden project, is it GW3 or some other new licence ?
---
The episode in general feels unusually well written and atmospheric for GW2. 
---
Hell despite the lack of content, this feels like the best experience of playing an Episode I can think off.
---
I got them all in one day and got the achievement so I don't think that's it.
---
Either I was glitched somehow or you don't actually need any stacks at all to open them.
---
yes. Raids get boring really fast. As long as I got my 150 LD for ring, I stopped doing them.
---
And will we have KR coming back ?
---
I've noticed that's also sometimes the case
---
All or Nothing felt pretty bad imo. Especially with the worst and most obvious cliffhanger in the history of writing stories.
---
Brilliant!
---
in b4 1st price win gets banned
---
&gt; If they drop a similarly sized patch the next month then great
---
Next month will be Wintersday with likely no changes at all from the last few years.
---
It is 100% guaranteed that there will be new maps or expanded maps that will give exp for the saga masteries.
---
If you actually contenst that you simply reject reality for to hate Anet.
---
I would use the hourly reminder if it was jormag whispers... that's brill.
---
I didn’t want to say that but basically.
---
"We" are bored, no good gw2 content.
---
ree
---
If you have everything the map offers why do the dailies in the first place? Even with the old system?
---
Isn't this basically the point though? You have actual NPC dialogue saying the exact same thing, that she deserved a warriors death to be beside her people fighting and died alone in a cave. It's mean t to be unceremonious and depressing.
---
People also seem to forget the players coming after the next episode comes along have to pay for the previous ones. It's not just locked behind PoF, it's also time sensitive, newer players have to shill a lot of cash for very subpar content.
---
after playing with cm groups its straight up impossible to play with non cm players tbh
---
Exactly. There is nothing to indicate any fair attempt at an alliance. 
---
Jormag is playing at being the King in Yellow, but we're not buying it.
---
I get the Eir bit, but how were Faolain and Balthazar sacrificed for shock value? They were represented as villains and had lead ups to their death, there was nothing shocking about them dying. 
---
Do people ITT even get what "shock value" is or is it just a way of saying "this character was killed and not in the way I expected/would have wanted"?
---
Haha no way, last time this sub went ''we'd pay for -this-!'' and then got asked to pay for -this- it went into outrage mode
---
Unless 3 is like 2 at the beginning, it wouldn't make much of a difference.
---
You can also use the names:
---
Fallen&gt;Aberrant&gt;Svanir
---
Which region are you in? I'm not sure about eu but fight guilds in na are pretty much dead, you would be better off joining a server with a large pug population that has regular pug tags. Borlis pass and fort aspenwood are the two biggest right now but any of the t1/2 servers would be ok really.
---
Didn't they kind of do this originally? I Swear that at one point in time you used to have to do the story of a dungeon before you could do the various wings but at a certain point they unlocked the dungeons because it was prohibitive to pickup groups because a lot of groups didn't like doing the story version of the dungeon. (I just specifically remember joining a dungeon a number of years ago and having to do the story version rather than the normal version).
---
That wasn't what you entirely meant. Which I get, and yeah it was mentioned that this was how the Strike Mission kind of worked in Episode 0... the end boss of the story is the strike and is now group content that you can repeat. It doesn't appear that EP1 Strike Missions are working the same way as you can go into it right away without completing the story first.
---
I fully agree that I think it would be beneficial to turn back and turn these boss fights at the end of storylines into groupable content that can be repeated. Part of the problem here is that the dev team would need to come up with viable rewards that make people want to repeat them, and they sometimes struggle with that. 
---
I've actually been thinking a lot about repeatable content and the lack thereof in this game despite the fact that the LS structure post Season 1 was meant to be more repeatable. Just going through the same old story over and over again isn't necessarily repeatable, most people consider going through the entire story fairly tedious. Something like turning end bosses into a group instance is far more satisfying  by and large and is also not particularly time consuming to implement on the dev's side.
---
I alternate between Witcher, Skyrim and gw2 usually. Things that keep me in this game are I guess the fashion, the buildcraft and some of my friends. 
---
Also, I do play some group content from time to time, its just not nearly as much as I used to, so maybe I should have said I play this game 'primarily' as solo RPG.
---
I mean it's not rocket science:
---
The next episode will be next year. Optimistically January but we all know that's not gonna happen with all the snow storms and holidays coming. Episodes won't hit alongside festivals so realistically next episode hits 3 months from now after Lunar New Year. That's end of February. So let's say  18th of February for episode 2.
---
After this it's going to be SAB which will take us to late April so the episode 3 will hit early May. Let's say  5th of May.
---
After this we'll get Dragon Bash and summer holidays and after that we'll get Four Winds which will push the episode 4 to September. 
---
After that Halloween and roughly at this time episode 5 in late November.
---
That's 4 episodes total next year with all the festivals that WILL return which are never paired with episodes.
---
The talks about "faster cadence" are just total marketing BS which no one will buy before they actually show us the money and push out episodes with 1-2 month cadence.
---
What do we have to talk about? It's a farming fashion simulator with a cash store in its current state.
---
Fighting is the red type. Fire is orange.
---
But he did complete the entire patch that’s playable? Must. Say. Anything. To. Prove. Op. Wrong. :: robot ::
---
I would say there isn’t a snowballs chance in hell.
---
Unless they make GW3 something like Overwatch 2, which isn't really a 2 but kind of an expansion + improved engine, and everything unlocked carries over, I highly doubt it.
---
This is such a lengthy string of assumptions that doesn't line up with what they've said, or the pace of the past few patches. We'll just have to wait and see.
---
Kind of disappointing, months of waiting for an hour of living story. Why haven't we got an expansion to clear up the cobwebs yet....
---
Why is that?
---
&gt; Then why are you cheering that something was being watched, rather than caring whether something was played?
---
I already answered that literally the next sense after:
---
&gt;Twitch drives intrest for the game. It drives intrest for any game. It shows engagement and acts as advertising and marketing.
---
You could have read it.
---
&gt;If people watched that Twitch stream that weren't already playing the game, and it made them more interested in playing the game, then that's great and all, but it's not some epic event. It's not some "proof" that a lot of people enjoy raiding, it only shows that people enjoy watching raiding, under very specific conditions.
---
I like how "breaking viewership records on the biggest gaming platform on the planet" isn't a big deal when it shows you to be wrong.
---
&gt;Because GW2 viewership records are really easy to beat. Like I said, it's a game that plays much better than it is watched. I play the game every day, I never watch a stream of it.
---
Once again, if it plays much better than it is watched, why was ERP so succesful?
---
Don’t forget to come back for wintersday! For all that free content! I mean all them free tonics **
---
They are pretty nice for players who want less glossy shit, and they aren't just some reskin of an existing shiverpeaks set, which is what I was worried about.
---
They're not for everybody obviously but the collection has other rewards that are good like bags and stuff.
---
7+ years old game and they're still waiting XDDD
---
Yep, a lot of people are just starved for many things (raids, fractals, PvP/WvW updates, notable rewards, changes to make certain elites actually fun to play again, etc.) so much that any disappointment is amplified.
---
It certainly doesn't help that it's kind of been a while bunch of letdowns recently. The big live event that ended up being a glorified blog post or Guild Chat, many (possibly most depending on your opinion) aspects of build templates' implementation and monetization, Chrono being made purposefully clunky and annoying to play (maybe not purposefully annoying, but the clunkiness was purposeful) and Scourge receiving a similar treatment, the first strike being pretty easy (and maybe the new one, but I haven't tried it yet) and having easily skippable mechanics, no information on even the possibility of new raids or fractals for a while before a recent German article says they'll at least not be for a while if at all, and then what's supposed to be the big start to the new LS season/saga having less content/replayability than the prologue (which was actually pretty good for the most part). 
---
It's a lot, even for someone like me who staunchly defended the game until the Chrono changes (and I'm not even a Chrono main, although I did enjoy the class and ended up playing it a lot in raids, it's just the principle of nerfing something through worsening the user's experience instead of just weakening the effects of their abilities) brought me down from 99% support to maybe 33-40% and the live event dropped me to like 5-10%. I don't hate the game, I'm just disappointed. The wind's been taken out of my sails, I suppose. I'll still login for each new episode and play for a day or two, but that's probably it unless something changes.
---
While I understand your frustration, I kinda like having time in between with nothing. Craft a new legendary, clear some maps on an alt (BL Keys). Or play another game.
---
That is really kind of you, but I want to take my time in the story, do it on my own. Thanks a bunch anyways!!!
---
Let's be generous and say it takes you a week to complete the majority of the Maps Explorables (Achievements, doing all Events to hear all Dialgue etc.) and let's assume we will get the next Episode in exactly 2 Months, January 19th.
---
In between we will have Wintersday for approx. 3-4 Weeks.
---
Wintersday is also one of the better Events where you can actually do some stuff (I love the JP, and we will also get our Mini Raid back (that was created by an intern *cough*). That leaves us with 4-5 Weeks of stagnation. Take other months with other Festivals in between (RiP for LNY and Four Winds) and you will have a full 7 weeks of nothingness.
---
If you only log in for new releases you're good to go, sure, but if you actually play in the time in between... well, you can only repeat the same old stuff.
---
I don't understand how there are people who can't grasp that
---
This is pretty much the vibe I get from most of these asshats. Like, don't get me wrong, this patch was pretty limp as far as content goes, but some people on here are straight of NEETS who expect Anet to serve them 12 hours of brand new content every day to fill the empty void that is their life. It's just painful to read how these folks have spent 7 miserable years following this game demanding the same unreasonable shit
---
Yes, people should lfg hours in advance because some entitled griefer is allowed to hold any group with requirements hostage.
---
Requirements are bad and elitist after all. 
---
Surely you understand this just leads to people not using lfg, which does not benefit anyone even the players that detest requirements for groups. It just makes the pug / lfg environment less sustainable and forced people to move to 3rd party software like discords.
---
Implying you don't simplify things yourself? Okay, going by your logic, whenever your family or SO complain about you 24/7, you should be happy. It's okay you didn't hear a single kind word from them in a year, they complain about you and it makes you feel better knowing *they care.* Right? Your neighboor loves you too, obviously. He loves you so much that he filed numerous complaints about you and your dog. What a caring man!
---
It's a very flawed argument. There are plenty of people who complain because they care, yes, but there's also plenty of people who like to complaing for the sake of complaining and nothing else. To fuel drama or just to vent, because someone else was complaining about them the whole day.
---
If you search for p3+ and have certain demands on the team comp, its not that easy
---
Were they on the test or was it something you were "allowed" to do?
---
I mean you can walk in the Sanctum once the story is completed. So no need to repeat the instance.
---
Unless you want fights against decent groups, then you better pm them and organise something.
---
You'll get enemies if you knock on enough walls... wouldn't necessarily call it fights.
---
Raids need a better LFG tool, some weekly reward incentives for certain bosses done in standard/challenge mode, and probably just other shit to guide players to it like having boss descriptions available (for old releases at least). 
---
I get the "carrot on a stick" philosophy isn't Anet's thing but they are really really really shit at letting people know what's actually out there in PvE and how much value it could have.
---
Ya 125 ice shards is super fast to get, I got close to 400 last night.
---
Dunno why you're being downvoted, but you have a point. As far as I remember, the first few days after the beetle was released, you started with full (or whatever you were left with before) endurance and anet changed that for godknowswhat reason. Definitely put a dent in my enjoyment about the beetle, but I've gotten used to it, still I am really glad they made changes again.
---
i really can't believe this is the top post about the content patch, but I guess thats mostly our own fault for upvoting it
---
EU or NA and skill level? Gvg guilds on EU are pretty much all recruiting in between their extended breaks. But most of these guilds wont train entry level players.
---
If they need to make a GW3 because of how GW2 is declining...then it will fail, because all the pieces for a great game already exists in GW2 - they have simply been failing to capitalize on it all.
---
Cool story bro. Im not the best player in the world (like every other person here), but ive done fractals quite a few times, and what you say doesnt match my experience (maybe i had luck, you know, i only have 400 ess or so).
---
Anyway, you keep believing that experience means nothing while learning (anything), and i'll keep not caring about your oppionion.
---
That's exactly the complaint people are making. I guess that didn't register with you?
---
Who ever said I was looking for a "fair fight"?
---
Then quit. Nothing is keeping you here except yourself. From what I hear FF is a perfect game. Why not just go there. I seriously don't get why people like you torture yourselves over this. It's like ordering the same thing off a menu and bitching about how bad it tastes instead of just ordering something else.
---
HoT was sort of a half-finished expansion when it launched, but the important thing is they patched it over time into what it is today. It was one of the few instances where they actually went back and worked on previous projects (although it wasn't very long after launch that they started and did most of the work) instead of just abandoning them for the next thing.
---
I still have fun with the game. Sure there could be more fractals and more players, but... It is still fun. The new story is very well made. And after 7 years in the game I still enjoy playing it.
---
You only get upvotes for complaints against the game, so the “artists” are adapting.
---
They don't care. They decided to make the releases shorter (in terms of time between each) so they can milk more of that release hype. For that reason, time is sensitive and quality is pushed aside.
---
thats very interesting. did you happen to find any lore regarding the nature of the Fallen or Aberrant while you were exploring? no luck for me yet
---
Thats what I said I don't think it is trying to help us its trying to manipulate us into killing the under water dragon for it to get the power please read what I said.
---
They just stopped developing gw2 and they laid off tons of developers. It's the big daddy killing this game off.
---
I don't get it, what makes you think that GW3 will solve everything?
---
They would need to drop the ball with GW2 and probably shut it down completely, then they would have to develop the game at best from the ground up or we end up with yet another game that uses an unsuitable engine. That, however, takes years to do.
---
GW1 Eye of the North was released in 2007 which could be an indicator when they started the developing of GW2. That is still 5 years before the game came out and they already had the groundwork of an engine at their disposal. 
---
So even when they now dropped their flagship GW2 completely they would have still a few years in front of them before they even have a finished project. A time they can't earn money because they focus on developing the new IP that might create the same controversy as GW2 did when it was announced.
---
And with everything that is going on now how would that be different with GW3? If you can't manage one project how will you be able to do that with another one or a new one?
---
So, I don't know what you all are thinking about when you are thinking of GW3... that will not be the salvation you are all looking for.
---
Nope. Although the loot is generally better.
---
I mean you can (could) get masteries faster than you can play the story.
---
You must be new around here.
---
don't call this childy mess of a story 'lovecrafitan' style of horror. This is 'stories to tell in the dark'/'X-Factor'-niveau, nothing more.   
---
Lovecraftian horror is the fear of the unknown, but we all know it's Jormag and his servants. There is nothing unknown in this story.
---
I must have missed that. Do you have a link to the announcement?
---
He never got to finish the "GER" :P
---
Steam has all kinds of good content you can pay for. Pick anyone of them you like and start gaming happily.
---
I'm sure many fell for it so the trick worked. Nicely done.
---
Funkos AND Charr fursuits.
---
Well, that remains to be solved. But i would have saved it locally regardless, simply because you won't need to log into your GW2 Account on ArenaNets page first and because the API key cannot be abused like a password can, for example.
---
Then I guess you're obviously not enjoying the "content" as you're here bitching at other players.
---
Cute joke about the meme though. Did you come up with it yourself?
---
If you have problems in school or can't focus, because of a game, you shouldn't play it anyway...
---
And not in the least repeatable
---
I dont get what you want. Most people enjoyed the prologue. Ascended cooking is specificly not what they were talking about since it released before the saga.
---
I've got plenty of gripes about the episode, but I have to give them props for absolutely nailing the eldritch feel.
---
No it doesnt, teams that were working on raids and fractals are probably working on strike missions now (probably I mean its my opinion obviously I have no view in what they're doing) if they intended to push a new strike mission every 2 months it makes sense they'd talk over that amount of bandwidth I can see 4 strike missions taking the same amount of work as a single raid or fractal!
---
As for introducing new things, they did. They reworked the dailies, they introduced the whole valor, resilience, vigilance mastery.
---
If the amount they release is enough or not, I guess that depends a lot on what kind of content you enjoy.
---
THIS is the shit I was looking for. Your theory is great, but I doubt Anet was thinking that far. Their story always has been pretty plain.
---
Nah, I knew why. I just like listening to idiots whine when they could just uninstall and find something better like I did with SWTOR and UO and other games when I became unhappy with them.
---
This is actually a perfect comparison to the feelings I had from this game. I saw that it's going nowhere, I felt abused at times, but it was really difficult to cut off yourself from it because deep down you still love it and hope for it to change.
---
The August 31 announcement and the build templates were like the last slap in the face after which I decided that it's enough.
---
Just look through the patchnotes
---
And still you're here farming negative karma
---
technically, they have a reason
---
I am bored like you , far from a pc and I'd like to read stuff on the game instead of the same shit over and over and over
---
&gt;I couldn't even see her because people on mounts covered her,
---
While I agree it should have been in an instance, no need to lie about how bad it was. That cave is a no-mount zone.
---
Nah, I like it. I'm just passing time on the train on my way to work. I'd rather be at home enjoying the gane but bills don't pay themselves.
---
Why quit? You can play Final Fantasy XIV and come back to GW2 every few months for a few hours of new content. It's not like it costs anything to keep GW2 on the hard drive while you play another game. I used to complain about the direction of the game because I thought it had potential and I wanted to see it improve but in all the years of voicing feedback it's not like anything came of it. Anet have their own idea of how players should engage with their content and I've adapted to it. So every few months I will log in, play the new content and then log off. If they ever want my money again then they can release an expansion. Until then my play style will match their content releases.
---
Tag as a spoiler.
---
To be fair, the norn *did* start the battle against Jormag when it woke up.  Though the kodan and quaggan did get caught off-guard in the crossfire.
---
And the whispers seem to be the act of a minion, given the voice's tone seems different. Could just be Anet messing with effects, but someone on discord did say the "Unknown" bugged into becoming a different name at one point, curiously enough.
---
Obviously a truce *as is* isn't a good deal. But given that we need another replacement before we can kill Jormag (who still has a full bedrock of ice between it and us as well), it'd be a decent stalling tactic. ;)
---
But more than anything else: it's a new approach for the Elder Dragons than "I am inevitable!"
---
No unfortunately, and that has been frustrating me. Some of the foes in the forest look quite underworld-ish but for now it's just some sort of haunted forest. I hope we'll get to know more in the future episodes.
---
That's a whole different story for the boneskinner though and after reading the related book, it changed my perspective on the "Hunger" achievement...
---
You will be amazed on how few ppl do raids. Look on gw2efficiency the % of cpletition of achievements related to raid. 
---
And think these are related to the upper part of the playerbase since lower part do not care at all nor use gw2efficiency.
---
Refusing to ping != Not having kp.
---
But clearly you are dumber than a metal rod.
---
Raids and LWS are literally free. If you don’t pay money to support the game, who honestly cares if you play for 5-6 years, good riddance freeloader.
---
Mas is a really good guild for Na they are on anvil rock server
---
They said word for word on guild chat last week that the map will be expanded. You can even find the gate into the next area in the far west
---
His last trainer, that's why he has trust issues
---
Honestly, has tired has I am of complaints, the drawings makes it 10 times better.
---
True.
---
What kind of content would you rather have?
---
I am more in favor of ChibiTP or Gnashblade Jr
---
Welcome to reddit.
---
IT was announced that EP2 will expand the EP1 map back when the saga was first announced.
---
ded gaem
---
Aaaaaaaany day now!
---
It was in last year's anniversary video, [I've got the timestamp for you.](https://youtu.be/WM-pKVHvfUo?t=215)
---
That was at the end of August (last year). The layoffs happened late February and were pretty unexpected.
---
Because it will take more than a week playing 2 3 hours a day. 
---
We are not 16 years old boys with nothing to do but  school (just a bit envy from me) . Actually I hate wintersaday which is really boring to me (timed JP are terrible)
---
I havent kill a single mob for a year+, I just log in to chat with friends and play some lute (sometimes with script, so I can eat in front of pc and provide some music). They even fucked up even that, ~90% of my  sheet-notes library doesn't work anymore.
---
Still trying to break myself of that habit lol
---
Something like that, they can save us a lot of time, i'm not uninstalled the game yet, but only because I don't need that cca 50GB.
---
a month or more ago i finished my gryphon, eeeks ago started to craft Binding of Ipos,  finished the first and the second stage of the precursor, I didn't logged in since..
---
I'm playing since the korean beta of GW1 (2005), and love the franchise, but the lack of communication, the constant grind, the gemstore gated mount skins are  
---
causing my loss of interest in the game, and i'm sorry about that.  
---
I have time, because in the last few weeks playing Deliverance: Kingdom Come, i played around 40-50 hours of it, and enjoying the medieval era, and the story, but there is less and less incentive to log in into GW2.
---
Yeah I am with you with all the debacles you mentioned. I guess though I have slowly become desensitized so I don't react as passionately I used to.
---
anet wanted the beetle to be slower then the raptor for short ways
---
Best way to go about it is take builds from [https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/), go into pvp lobby, plop those builds approximately in pvp build, go whack the golems, look at what each skill does, how it looks, how it feels. Keep in mind that skills that lock you in place take more practise and skill to be used correctly.
---
Then decide what you like most, and level that.
---
Ive been doing that on each expansion release, and thats how I knew which elite spec I like (dh) and which I detest (weaver) without spending too much time on unlocking those.
---
Group based content that's worth repeating. Not even for the content itself, but because it can serve as a focal point to anchor a community around. I've seen so many players quit and so many guilds disband or become inactive and a major factor in that is a lack of focus on community elements by Anet. It's been years since we got new Guild Missions, we don't have Guild PvP like GvGs the way that Guild Wars 1 did. There's no real reason to organise into permanent social groups but it's that kind of social structure that keeps players engaged and playing. Two hours of content every few months isn't enough to hold the community together and as more and more individuals decide to just stop logging on, it has a knock on effect where people start to quit because it's depressing to log on, check your friend list or guild roster and seeing that the people you liked playing with have left. Content in itself won't fix the issue because the core issue is social erosion, but it could certainly help slow it down.
---
And here I am happy about the game content with no time to rush the content accused to be a white knight cause I am not complaining
---
It's like you completely ignored the other discussion threads right now with zero upvote and focused on the ones upvoted to somehow prove your point. You were supposed to look at new, not the front page. Obviously the front page is the ones that have been upvoted. 
---
Anyone that has spent any meaningful amount of time on this sub will know how trigger-happy a few people are with downvotes. It's like clockwork, the moment something is posted it's downvoted, I was almost sure it was some kind of bot. 
---
But then again that's just me being suspicious cause I saw the same thing on the mmorpg so I ended up unsubbing. Make what you will of your stats but the reason *why* people down vote and upvote can't be measured, and you'd have to be in denial to say people need to put more effort in their posts as if that ever mattered in this particular sub.
---
You have a strange world view. Removing loot from what I what was doing, and will still do, is my complaint.
---
"This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper."
---
People using then in place of than, and than in place of then, are way more triggering.
---
I know maybe this may be a bit of a slightly...different opinion than what others might have, but I personally agree with the hype thing. I'm not hyper jumping over joy over the contents of this chapter, there are definitely valid criticisms said by people here and probably a decent sizr list of things you could improve for this episode, but I truly ended up enjoying the dark atmosphere and what the story might eventually set up, maybe more than the actual contents of the episode (i.e. My imagination is filling in the blanks).
---
I do have my own problems about how this episode was handled but...I...still kinda enjoyed it...I just want to hope that the next episode is at least just as dark.
---
I didn't get the achievement from using this boneskinner tonic.

More Crap Masteries To Grind
---
Give Us Your Money
---
If I cannot Carrie everything I would not leave
---
So this is getting stupid lengthy, so I'll just repeat the important part of my posts:
---
1. Jormag is evil. Yes, we know this. You don't need to try to convince me.
---
2. Jormag is **explicitly confirmed** to be the only Elder Dragon that prefers converts over slaves.
---
   1. Because Jormag's minions are converts, they likely still have their own free will, unlike other dragon minions. That means that they act how they want to act.
---
3. Jormag does view most mortals as ants not worth their attention. They don't even care that the average Son of Svanir will kill its minions or vice versa. But when they find mortals worth their attention, such as Asgeir and the Commander, *they care*.
---
4. Of the six Elder Dragons who's personalities are known, Jormag is the most sensible to be the one who offers a truce and is willing to change their ways. Because Zhaitan and Mordremoth made slaves, and Kralkatorrik and Primordus only show intent to destroy and kill. *Only Jormag* has shown both the intent to rule and the willingness to allow freedom.
---
5. Even if you argue some arbitrary "what if" scenario for one situation, the fact remains that Jormag *let Asgeir go* when they were face to face. And even before this episode, we have Jora, who was touched by Jormag's corruption, rejected the offer, and was not corrupted as Svanir was. Which proves, even if you ignore all the other cases, that Jormag is willing to spare those who deny.
---
As to the other stuff about Glint's Legacy:
---
&gt;Actually the line "caused the  collapse to begin" is rather explicit. A "collapse" does not stop half  way waiting for further input, it is a cascading failure which keeps  going unless actively counteracted.
---
If the collapse continued, then the world would be getting worse and worse as time went until Zhaitan and Mordremoth were replaced. So that's pretty explicitly not the case, and Sadizi's words is - as we well know due to him talking in past tense, then present tense, then past tense again with no notable sign of changing tenses but got dev confirmation about - not exactly the best wording.
---
&gt; We still have no explanation how this "balance" works however 
---
While we lack the explicit details of what all can become an Elder Dragon, we know enough that Balthazar taking the magic and then leaving Tyria would not suffice. Might even just be the "and then leaving Tyria" that disqualified him for all we know.
---
Point is, however, Balthazar remains proof that the forefront issue is "balance of The All" and that four Elder Dragons are a bare minimum for survival.
---
Should they ever asspull Aurene into becoming the One True Elder Dragon, they just retconned half of their currently established story.
---
&gt;Not sure how "causing" a dragon rise  can be an issue when half of them are already awake and the rest soon to  follow. And where are her eggs? Is this just her not trusting us with  anything again? (yes I know it's because they don't actually plan out  the story in such detail that far in advance)
---
Seems you're confused. All of Glint's eggs except one - Aurene's - were destroyed before the events of GW2. In Season 2, it is explicitly stated that the egg the Master of Peace has was the last egg left intact.
---
The implication to me is that the rest were destroyed when the Great Destroyer woke, given it sent destroyers after Vlast who was within a part of Glint's Lair at the time.
---
So in order to hatc hthose eggs before they were unfortunately destroyed, before the nursery cities were built, would require exposing the world to high quantities of magic before the events of Nightfall - before **any** of the Elder Dragons were beginning to wake up.
---
Yeah, though since I play group content much less frequently than before my gold income isn't too much these days. So most of my buildcraft stays as buildcraft and isn't really transferred to game, but thats okay :)
---
nice. i cant wait to read it! i thought the boneskinner and the aberrant were related somehow but i guess that was just me matching colors.
---
wow nostalgia! so many hours wasted with that game &lt;3
---
Resetting the adventure brings it down to 2 seconds
---
GW2 is the best example how even the best project can be turned to sh*t by notorious ignoring of the feedback and all the pleas the community gives. We wanted split balance for years and instead the game state is that every class feels like crap. We wanted gvg content and instead we got some pve crap in WvW maps. We wanted epic and entertaining story and instead we got some angry feminists as a writer pushing their own political agenda and shitting on community for not giving a standing ovation.
---
When the game started we had updates every 2 weeks and more content that you can chew. Now we get content that is keeping you playing for like 2-3 hours every 3-4 months and old content (dungeons, fractals, raids) is dead and forgotten. Few days ago i saw a topic stating the last new fractal was released over 300 days ago. What a bulls**t.
---
And yet, we get gemstore updates every week. Interesting that they dont lack people in that area.
---
The game went to sh*t, because of bad management, crappy marketing and false advertising. Remember how we didnt get full set of gen2 legendary weapons till post PoF living story? Remember that it was Hot marketing point? How about raid legendary armor fixes? Oh, your screwed up and filthy greedy templates that charges us money for something that was supposed to be QoL update dont even work with legendary gear? And there is no sign for fixing dye channels on lg armor? Instead we got what, leggins, tea and frickin sandwiches.
---
The servers can go offline any moment for all i care. Downvote me all you want, what i wrote is pure honest truth from a player with over 11 000 hours played and more than 26 000 ap...
---
Been fun, go play something else as i did. You will not find anything worthwhile anymore in this game.
---
Just more evidence that the game is on maintenance mode while Anet tries to figure out what the fuck the future of their company is after their planned next generation of games got shitcanned by NCSoft
---
It's a completely different thing. Your SO and family are not your customers and you're not trying to sell them something.
---
It's true there is plenty of people who complain just because others do or they don't even play anymore (but maybe they'd like to come back?) - but lot's of players who complain care about the game a lot. 
---
Truth be said if you don't care you don't speak up - cause why bother if you moved on.
---
Yes, but people forget that the best way to tell a company you don't like a game is tell them why and leave it until the fix it or never come back, a bad game does not have many players and the developer will notice.
---
I tend to be a bit annoyed with the cynical "i'Ve PlAyEd ThRoUgH tHe PaTcH iN 2H" takes, but to be quite honest this patch does have me worried. If every patch in the saga had this size what meaningful story could they tell? This is also immediately noticeable in the narrative pacing of the patch: While I thoroughly enjoy the eerie/creepy atmosphere, such moods need time to develop and resolving the mystery what was going on so fast was …
---
There are still a few thing to cling to though: There are a bunch of new assets and new tech (e.g. mounted foes dismount on engage, foes that eat and distribute food, 4 mastery lines) and the need to develop these first might have left less time for map/instance constructing than subsequent episodes will have now that quite a few things already exist…
---
&gt; yeah, the constant bashing, negativity, toxicity and the all around hostile environment towards ppl who still like the game and the content it offers has absolutely nothing to do with it.
---
I'm still logging in daily and yet I've lost most of my motivation to come to this subreddit since around the raid tournament clown fiesta. The sub got brigaded like hell by the self-proclaimed "most dedicated players" and bandwagonned into such a pit of disgust that you still can't step into it without getting your feet sullied. Any piece of news is filled with the same - mostly disconnected - bashing from the same people who have left the game around a hundred times already, and actually light-hearted fun content will tend to be disregarded as not topical enough and plagued with the same tangential drama remarks.
---
The game is pretty obviously on maintenance/minimum effort mode while Anet tries to figure out what the fuck the future of their company is after their planned next generation of games got shitcanned by NCSoft
---
Ahhhh. You're talking about the weird crazy people, not the community as a whole.
---
Yeah, those are creepy.
---
I've been really wanting to share my experiences but after checking the general consensus of this sub I've been too timid to share whatever real thoughts I had on this episode.
---
I just want to have a friendly conversation and talk about the content with someone else about the episode without being afraid.
---
Me too! Haven’t played the new episode yet but sounds exciting!
---
it took me 1 try to kill the boss in 3 minutes...
---
&gt;It's like you completely ignored the other discussion threads right now with zero upvote and focused on the ones upvoted to somehow prove your point. You were supposed to look at new, not the front page. Obviously the front page is the ones that have been upvoted.
---
You're either arguing in bad faight, didn't read my comment or don't know how reddit works. I **specifically** said that *"rating only visible after a certain amount of time has passed"*. The screenshot that I posted had **every** new post that had their rating revealed. The ones you are referencing now, **half an hour later**, looked like [this](https://imgur.com/a/ruRxnCz) when I made that post, they had no rating so I *obviously* can't make a comment about them, as I have no idea yet, wether they are upvoted or not. I did look at new and I made the best faith effort to adress your ridiculously uncharitable opinion. Trying to paint it like I looked at the frontpage when every single claim I made pertains to the "new"-section screenshot I posted is hillariously ridiculous.
---
&gt;Anyone that has spent any meaningful amount of time on this sub will know how trigger-happy a few people are with downvotes. It's like clockwork, the moment something is posted it's downvoted, I was almost sure it was some kind of bot.
---
You literally, *literally*, can't know that unless you post here frequently. Post Karma is invisible for more than 2 hours after posting, so you cannot know wether something gets "immediately downvoted, almost like a bot", unless you post yourself, at which point the hidden karma score is visible. You made 3 posts over the course of over half a year, there is no way in any version of hell that you have a big enough sample size to make a claim like that.
---
&gt;Make what you will of your stats but the reason why people down vote and upvote can't be measured
---
No, but what can be measured are your baseless claims of posts getting downvoted immediately. Again, you are literally incapable of knowing that, just like anyone else who only posts here occasionally. And sure, maybe "only effort posts get upvoted" is a bit of wishful thinking on my part, but I'd rather have wishful thinking than make entirely unsubstantiated accusations and then act in bad faith when called out on it.
---
Don't you play all 9 classes? xD
---
Hey dumbshit. Someone likes something you dont and they're willing to spend money on it. You may want to get a little less butt hurt every time this happens
---
Guild Wars 3 never.
---
I'd argue a shift to ONLY producing content for the lowest denominator of players is what bored people out of the game.
---
Something that the lowest common denominator of players has consistently demanded... on this very sub. 
---
So to say they bored themselves out of the game isnt honest. Anet literally abandoned the gameplay they enjoy, slowly and without ever even informing them.
---
&gt; If the collapse continued, then the world would be getting worse and worse as time went until Zhaitan and Mordremoth were replaced.
---
Well my interpretation is that Aurene is *enough* of a stopgap to at least slow it down for a while and either way we don't actually know what would be collapsing or how it would happen. Are the BSF rifts or Kralk's variants signs of this "collapse"? Is it something the mortals can't even perceive until the world just goes poof?
---
&gt; Seems you're confused. All of Glint's eggs except one - Aurene's - were destroyed before the events of GW2. In Season 2, it is explicitly stated that the egg the Master of Peace has was the last egg left intact.
---
The confusing part for me is what exactly Glint's plan was between the two games. If the eggs were already gone replacing the EDs before they rise wasn't going to happen and 3-5 of them would destroy civilisation almost as effectively as the full 6. So she'd need to change plans instead of clinging to this now incomplete Scion plan.
---
Not the best quality I know, usually don't do it. But maybe it still helps!
---
If you're Margarine, you're gonna have to give me a kiss ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I don't even have the will to finish the story even tho it's pretty good, I'm so down. I give up.
---
i joined a random lfg group and got gold first pull lmao.
---
I don't think you can trade like this. Otherwise everyone would be just exchanging winterberries to other s3 map currencies. 
---
The closer to this is Elonian Trader in Dragonfall where you can buy s4e1-5 currencies for votalite magic but that is capped to 5 per day.
---
On a side note I understand for asking some Kp but asking for 250 kp is insane. It’s like the rich and the poor in the joker movie.
---
There's no frustation on my part at all :) I'm kind of a turtle regarding the content in GW2. I usually wait a week or so before doing the latest map/story, and take all my time going through it
---
Good god... did Hall of Chains really release in 2017? I've been waiting for this game to be fun again for way longer than I should've.
---
Me too!! It was by far one of my most favorite content releases!
---
It's not free.
---
Well living story stopped being interesting around... ouff... 4 years ago? With the Bloodstone Fen? There were glimpses of cool stuff in between, sure. But overall ever since they went with their rote formula for them they amounted to very very little.
---
Basing your opinion of the content on the comments of reeeedditors is a poor choice.
---
Not a sarcasm in this one though. Just saying how it is.
---
The fight looks fun, too bad it lasts like a minut and a half lmao
---
I was commenting on "You cant justify skins to be content", which... doesn't address skin quality or desirability at all.
---
I've never wanted a gem store weapon or armor skin enough to justify the gold-&gt;gem cost except my top hat. I have bought many mount skins and account upgrades that way though, but I enjoy playing SW.
---
Yes, I agree that more high quality skins of all types should be made available through gameplay, but I don't think that the lack of it makes the current game *miserable*.
---
If you enjoy the game, and enjoy the gold grinds that are available, I assure you the gold-&gt;gem gameplay is not miserable. If you are tired of the grinds that are available, or if the game doesn't have content you enjoy, I don't have anything helpful to say to you.
---
Tried that with someone who did a replay on the story step, It doesn't work.
---
Good enough, thx
---
Meh, coming not quite soon in the next episode: explanation on how she was betrayed by the very trusted soulmate who gave into dragon's influence at the very last moment, killed her, got back to own senses, regretted the deed, buried her and now ready to join our party to exact revenge on the dragon (to slightly offset Braham going 200% whiny regret babbler). Also expect forced drama in icy flashback scenes for, like, two next episodes.
---
It's like a big neon sign on what narrative is trying to do (in the most clumsy and stupid way possible).
---
I wish they'd picked some other character for this but oh well.
---
What really sucks is when you first enter the map and begin the story, it's incredible. The atmosphere is great and the story is interesting. But then you get the scope of the map and you finish the story in an hour. It kind of gives you blue-balls because it's not quite there. Like a prototype of a Ferrari that's really cool, but not at the build quality to handle top speeds or sharp turns.
---
hey this is a cool idea fk now I need an extra char slot
---
This explains the Average Joe ....
---
People complaining about the game WANT the game to be better because they love it and are frustrated by its decline
---
Don't forget to log-in so you get it for free and you don't need to pay 200 gems for something not worth it.
---
I've checked your post history and all you do is complain about those that complain about the state of the game, which doesn't make you any better than them. I hope you realize that and are able to see the irony of what you're doing at some point.
---
Because complaining does nothing and makes you look bad. Discussing even negative things constructively is what you should be doing.
---
Example of complaining: "This isn't what ANet promised! I hate this game! Fuck this game!"
---
Example of constructive criticism: "I feel they under delivered what was promised in this episode. This doesn't feel like expansion level content to me."
---
The old one had a ribbon on the mane?!
---
Not sure what you're implying here. Are build templates not at least somewhat technically impressive for how much they can do, discussions of monetization aside?
---
Ye this sub has more thread of ppl complaining than ppl actually discussing about game . With dulfy dead I hoped this community could autoregulate but no, most thread are just the same complain. So since I am bored and far from a pc I am answering to any post on this
---
Makes it easier to get to the gemstore with it on the end. No more accidentally clicking on wvw or guild. Spend before socialize I say.
---
I know you love dismissing issues you dont understand and you cant relate to. But its genuinely retarded.
---
You kick them, they rejoin. You cannot stop them from joining. You cannot stop them from taking you off LFG for regular parties either. You cant take squads into certain types of content, so you cant turn your party into a squad.
---
You think OP needs half an hour to kick this dude once? Of course not. 
---
The issue is they can simply come back, as much as they like. They can effectively prevent you from using lfg as long as they are determined. In pvp or in fractals or plenty of other content.
---
So tell me, how does kicking them solve anything?
---
So is the golem according to what you just said so fun, so much more fun.
---
only becuase there is a raif hub it doesnt mean that it is hard to get to the actual raid entrance on the maps... hnece it simply isnt "exhausting". and if iirc not all raids have an entrance in the open world, so the hub makes sense for raids.
---
&gt; ...Also, excuse my english, i'm not a native speaker...
---
That much is obvious, but that excuse also doesn't work on me since English is my third language.
---
You should probably refrain from arguing with people and questioning their intellect while communicating in a language you can't fully comprehend. It would be the logical thing to do, but I fully understand that most people are not logical; therefore, you are excused for your behaviour.
---
Oh but I completed story, get masteries and did the strike yes. Miss leopard champion and weapons oh and light achievement.  But where are the thread on this ? No you are just opening post on post complaining on everythi g
---
Exactly. Anet devs aren't your friends or relatives. You complain because you don't like what they do, not because you love or care for them. If your complaint is valid and written calmly and respectfully, then you shouldn't feel the need to justify your opinion.
---
Complaining about something doesn't automatically mean you care for the subject. Sometimes it is, sometimes it's not. You accused someone of simplifying while doing the very same thing.
---
The "lay-offs" excuse can carry them only so far. The next excuse is "be happy because it's free content". As if anyone would pay for anything at this point except for a full expansion.
---
People do plenty of the latter and still get downvoted and told to "Just quit lol" alll the same.
---
If true that would be a major update tbh.
---
Are they? They are a ui hotfix that has reduced QoL by removing autoswapping in different modes and by majorly screwing up sPVP mode (due to the way the templates don't change until you enter pvp).
---
There is nothing impressive about them.
---
the story, the map, the atmoshpere, the masteries and the new strike mission feature is exactly on the same expansion level quality of HoT or PoF.
---
Ohh. You must be very good player, right? Go try yourself in esports then, right? Ohh. Or its too hard for you? Guild Wars 2 is casual mmorpg and deal with it. We don't want this kind of tryhards here which are too weak to compete in real challenging games and comes here... Looking for challenges in casual game is pathetic.
---
When do you get the achievement, as soon as you do it, or after the fight?
---
You are using 2 different browsers that each use their own stored data. 
---
P.S. I think you are the last person using IE
---
It's only been 2 months, and why are you only playing an hour of the content? Sounds like a personal problem if you're only doing a single part of the new content like that. 
---
I could say the whole game is only an hour of content if I decide to base that on only caring about the first few hearts. That doesn't make it true lol. 
---
Please tell me some other MMO's that put out consistent content releases that are as big or bigger and more frequent. Then also tell me some that do that for free. Or even tell me some that do it only *as much* and *as frequent* as GW2.
---
Obviously in the past they were putting devs, money, and time into other projects, but what do you actually think they're doing right now? Do you legitimately believe they're just letting their employees sit around not doing much/any work and they're still just handing them money for free? lol
---
"Listen, I know the patch should have gone live 5 minutes ago but there's this one thing I forgot to tell you guys. We NEED to update the BLTC icon, it just isn't good enough anymore. We need a fresh icon to keep our players interested in the game alright, I want this done ASAP - the patch release will have to wait till this is ready to be shipped!" 
---
That's probably how yesterday went
---
The prologue was enjoyed with the assumption that it was just a small prologue that led in to the actually big stuff, a promise of what's to come, not just another ~~living world~~ saga episode.
---
&gt;Ascended cooking is specificly not what they were talking about since it released before the saga.

The golem is fine. It’s an entry level boss. Is it as fun as Sabir or Adina? No way. But it’s the first of many, and looking at the Kodan bros for this week’s SM, it looks like new mechanics are being introduced slowly. I’m not too particularly concerned at the moment.
---
So you think dulfy regulated the community? All (s)he did was post walkthrough.
---
Stop posting firebrand videos or we will get rp smushed.
---
&gt;Raids and LWS are literally free.  
---
raids straigth up require expansions so they arent free and you also need expansions to play the LWS episodes so, the episodes itself are free tho that's true
---
Initially thought it was going to be random luck, but if you pay attention to the boss whilst he's still visible he faces and jumps in the direction of the pillar he's going to hide behind, hope this helps
---
Wow!
---
Also what got me into raids as well.
---
Ah yes, the old way of spending gold to skip content. No wonder you're so salty.
---
I actually could just starting copy pasting answers to post
---
I think you guys are crying too much over some free content. Of what I understood, the map won't stay like this. They plan to do the same thing they did in season 2: add the map piece by piece. The only problem is that, back then, we got a new episode every 2 weeks. I hope they will introduce the next episode faster...this was really small. Even the prologue was bigger. The only reason I don't cry about the episode is because I am still working on Coalescence and Vision so I have more time to do them before the next episode XD
---
&gt; Are build templates not at least somewhat technically impressive for how much they can do,
---
ArcDPS had been doing the same thing for years and far far better than build templates are.
---
That's a cool idea.
---
I can't even tell if this is a joke
---
And on the other hand, I would absolutely trade paying $60 for an entire expansion vs paying zip for a living world season.  Would it be nice to have both?  Sure, but it seems that's no longer possible.  Not like I don't have dozens of other games I could play.
---
You can increase your luck next time with word like *quaggan* and *art*.
---
What are you talking about.... i just finished everything a couple of hours ago without even rushing it....Strike was ez af, collection are just braindead, map meta was just bad...really bad. This is just low quality not even gonna talk about quantity.
---
No. I think that since there were no more a place with walkthrough like dulfy we should use this place to help each other  Instead of having a useful post hidden among 1000 on the same complain
---
most of the sub SAYS they would pay money, but realistically only a small percent will.
---
and the devs currently only make money from cosmetic/convenience items, that's why the gameplay notes look like a postit while the cosmetic ones look like Santa's list for all the world's children
---
&gt; far far better
---
You wanna qualify that at all?
---
If you don't already have them (you would get them for free if you logged-in when they first launched), you need to buy season 2, 3, and 4 through the Gem Store (press [O] in-game). You can buy them in bundles or through the story panel.
---
It's quality to me. Thank you!
---
Yeah, but how long until then? Even people who wants to do all achievements can do that by just playing 2-3 hours a day and at the most 2 weeks.
---
&gt;  by majorly screwing up sPVP mode
---
That's hardly something templates did themselves, just poor foresight and follow-through by the devs for what templates would affect.
---
Tell me some other MMO's that put out consistent content releases that are as big or bigger *and* more frequent. Then also tell me some that do that for free. Or even just tell me some that do *as much* content *as frequently* as GW2. 
---
Obviously in the past they were putting devs, money, and time into other projects, but since they've all been let go, what do you actually think they're doing right now? Do you legitimately believe they're just letting their employees sit around not doing much/any/acceptable work and they're still just handing them money for free?
---
No one forbids you to learn anything. It is just not required in public schools
---
I'm sorry that you now need to move the goalposts because your first statement was false.
---
And if you actually read that thread which you are dismissing, you will see direct responses to a number of player concerns including issues with Rampage and Holosmith in sPvP. The release notes also didn't include balance updates (as we would have had an early post if so) but don't let that fact bother you either.
---
Most of us paid for it in September of 2017.
---
Doing the same . I am stuck here without a pc and too much time
---
&gt; people on mounts covered her

Dunno what you're talking about, the cave is a mount-free zone.

Have luck with your keys. It's a black lion chest exclusive.

Teleport skills like Blink and Lightning Flash also help.

&gt; the 40 min story episode.

Since when has everyone turned into a bloody speedrunner all of a sudden? Getting the Raven Mastery to lvl 2 alone on the map took me 40 minutes for sure

Black Sloth Trading Post?
---
I love how there's a new patch, new map, new story and everyone is more excited by the new launcher.
---
XDDD
---
Ignore the Reddit Crybaby Echochamber.   
---
You can hand them a Silver fucking platter, with Gold utensils and the finest foods.   
---
And they'd scream and kick and shout because they wanted diamond, not gold.
---
There are achievement linked to just doing a raid boss kill or a level in fractal. Nothing complex . U can use to get the idea of how many ppl completed an episode or did a dungeon
---
I just say anet has very specific metrics on what ppl do and do not so they know what to add and what will be liked .
---
&gt;Another proof that this was gonna be a proper expansion
---
This is what I was responding to when you came in to add a counterpoint to me lol. I'm not saying you said that, I'm saying that that is what I was commenting on, so I don't understand why you're responding to me as if your point is in contrast to mine. 
---
This all seems to be a misunderstanding between you and I lol.
---
take a look at his post history, he's just a salt machine
---
&gt; discussions of monetization aside
---
Can you read?
---
I'm clearly talking about the templates themselves.
---
Saw that as well, and was like dang, that's a cute lion.
---
Map expanding would be against the narative that Anet bad. Of course it was forgotten instantly.
---
Me, my guild and millions of players still enjoy this game and think it isn't dying. We have to deal with a bunch of negative people that do nothing but complain about everything to the point of clogging up the forums and subreddit with complaints but no solutions instead of just moving on or finding positive things or actually offering helpful solutions. Personally I and others in my guild (that is currently growing to the point we have needed to appoint new officers to handle all of the new members) found the new map and content fun and we enjoy the spooky feel of the new map. It's just you entitled whiners that think the game is dying because you didn't get a whole new paid games worth of content in a new patch.
---
Why was it not like this in the first place
---
EP2.
---
There's also a collection and a book.
---
It's impossible to tell in this subreddit, sadly. lol
---
Sure that's possible. I'm just arguing against the whole "the game was supposed to end after season 4; they were going to move on to a different game; now that that's cancelled, they made up the whole season 5 stuff on the spot" idea.
---
Also, it's so difficult to understand that people who have played a game for seven years while seeing its constant decline would rather say something than quietly give up and move on.
---
The Reddit echo chamber Demands Validation!   
---
Artists Comply or get left in the dust.
---
As was expected.
---
To get the story for free, really.
---
Even in that thread there are tons of people that are unhappy with their lives complaining about everything, including being angry at the fact that other people are happy about the launcher lmao.
---
Anet , this isn't the elite spec you're looking for .
---
GJ Roul .
---
Well they are a ui fix and an autoclicker. Both are implemented badly enough that using them is both counterintuitive and cumbersome.
---
There were plenty of threads out there discussing their shortcomings in great detail.
---
The only thing impressive about them is how much they fell short.
---
Why should they, legendary armor, and weapons for that matter, SHOULD mean something, raids are not hard, the requirements through raids for legendary armor isn’t that hard. If people want legendary armor then work for it, there is already too much just handed to people in GW2.
---
Oh and ppl can complain about stuff but when 90% of the post are complaining about everything when actually content is good even if few it starts to get stupid.
---
This subreddit is hostage of a louder smaller part who loves complaining and screaming the end is night , the game is dead , I am leaving and so on.
---
A new player reading this would think this is the truth but it is not . Maps are full and game is alive more than ever.
---
If u want to leave leave but stop complaining on everything . This subreddit has so few useful content it is crazy.
---
Yeah it's terrible. I was upset about Eir's death as well.
---
Original had soul, the new one is soulless.
---
No I expect it to expand with episode 2 like said by Anet. I do expect that in January so they can go episode festival episode festival with small updates in between.
---
Seems like you are as well considering you're still here. Let alone take the time to make this shitpost.
---
Hi you the newgrounds guy?
---
Nice strawman there. "just admit you hate ANet, everything is fine!"
---
Come on now, when will you all open your eyes?
---
&gt;  had unlimited templates, and they were actual templates instead of loadouts.
---
Can you?
---
It depends on what your playstyle and goal is. If you like major squad battles than EBG has more of those. If you prefer roaming/skirmishing with typically smaller groups you would enjoy the borderlands more.
---
If its that short, nothing but you missed my point. Some people can play for hours and finish the story, while some want to do it in 20min and then they complain there was nothing to it, because they didn't look at the other stuff you can do in the maps.
---
Happened with petrified wood, jade node, orrian pearl, diflurite, kournan supply chest and now eternal ice iirc
---
when you stand mounted at the start flag of a challenge you'd get an endurance regeneration boost anyway
---
I'm assuming you're directing this at the people complaining. You may want to edit and specify that because it is a little ambiguous, you may get a lot more upvotes instead of downvotes.
---
Was the hide and seek with the Skyscale "grinding your butt off?" Was it that difficult? Was being FORCED to listen to a story about fractal-like time looping "grinding your butt off?" You're ignoring what I said and what the actual content actually is and just parroting this line of "grind for the sake of grind".
---
When the fight started I didn't attack him. I directly went behind a pillar near the wall. He jumped to me, so I tried again on the other side. He ported away, I got the achievement and bugged the instance. The boss never reappeared and there was no white cloud anywhere.
---
Depending on how many dailies you were doing, karma gain might be bigger or smaller for you. 
---
It's still sip of karma in chest but now you get 3 chests per daily. So doing all dailies (8) gives you 24 Sips of Karma (1500x24=36k karma)
---
To get that previously you had to do 24 dailies (obviously) so 6 maps instead of 2.
---
If its going to happen with episode 2 in 4 months from now then that doesn't really change the fact that for a single release this was ridiculously small.
---
The map we got (and the map we will get) are both still embarassingly tiny. The fact that they're part of the same map doesn't change that.
---
Or they don't care about internet points and just show what they think.
---
&gt; had unlimited templates
---
Copy and paste into a notepad
---
The only ACTUAL argument you have is the idea of templates versus loadouts, which I think is only somewhat valid. That doesn't scream "far far better" to me.
---
That's not particularly relevant though. They could make new maps with more reused assets too. It's essentially the same.
---
More content without a loading screen is somewhat relevant, I suppose, but it also means less player density on that map.
---
I'm not opposed to it, they just seem equivalent.
---
Oh hi Kalamari, someone well known here to suck up to ANet hard. Is Hina going to show up to?
---
"over the course of the season"? For fuck's sake, the FIRST EPISODE is already far shorter than the prologue, what expansion-level content will they add? Actually bothering to make the episodes longer? How long will i have to wait when neither the prologue nor Ep 1 delivered ANYTHING?
---
FB is better
---
Reminds me of this:

---
Well, there we go! :)
---
post of a post? so meta.
---
Per Guild Chat last week, the rewards are not capped at all.
---
See if this was their plan, to make strike missions as a build-up for raids, I think they're actually doing a pretty solid job of it... and that's what I thought their plan was all along when strike missions as a feature was first presented to me.
---
But after the [news](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dyofr5/we_wont_get_any_fractals_raids_or_legendaries/) that we won't see any new raids (or fractals or legendaries) in the near future, the cynic inside me is getting more and more convinced that this is just them abandoning a game mode that has some of the best combat, mechanics, and content in the entire game in favour of an accessible, watered-down 10-man instanced content.
---
Yeah the new strike is an improvement, but let's be real. It's not going to hold a finger to raids and those who are looking for 10-man hardcore content like raids are not going to get any satisfaction from it.
---
Yes actually, my own opinion is truth since i've been saying this since the whole thing started and i've been proven right time and again.
---
Thanks for proving me right AGAIN little white knights :) Keep it up!
---
I took my time. While doing the story, i also did the map meta and also the map completion. After the story i went to the strike mission. Everything was done in 1:30h. So even if you don't rush, you will finish fast.
---
Troll or Disease?
---
Yeah, the killing off of **[insert name here because I don't know how to use spoiler text on Reddit]** just to have them die was HORRIBLE. 
---
Yeah, I get that it was a good time for them to go, but it still just felt rushed and lifeless. This character has been a major character since 2012 and they didn't even get a cutscene or anything to show emphasis on their death.
---
Character select screen change in the gemstore when?
---
I haven't gotten to that yet, but the Boneskinner lured me to a trap by sounding like a person in trouble...
---
Most of the daily chests were tedious to accomplish and only rewarded 1 of the map resource though... The hearts + gathering route we're almost always a better option and in some cases events.
---
Now this is fun, i remember how in the past i mastered autoloot fast enough so i could forget about this and now i have to get the "same" mastery again just to be able to loot them with my F key. This is hat i call "cooooool" :D
---
#ThankYouAnet
---
With friends like this, who needs enemies?
---
I loved our fail attempt at fighting Kralk. As much as I do like Aurene, and I like her a lot, I think it'd have been better if she stayed dead, simply because it would mean that YES, we can fail, and YES, it does have severe consequences. 
---
The suspens you'd have after that everytime a character is in danger would be overwhelming.
---
&gt; Copy and paste into a notepad
---
So, do the developer's job for them? I wanted templates specifically so I wouldn't have to manually fiddlefuck with this shit.
---
&gt;The only ACTUAL argument
---
I mean sure, if you ignore all the other inconvinient ones like monetization and limited templates, ease of use ect ect.
---
Everything I've said has been right for months and many here have noticed it. Not my fault you white knights refuse to see it and continue to worship everything ANet does. They even failed at something as simple as Templates, yet you all still defend them like they were a little indie company/
---
What runes are you talking about? Do you have any source for that info?
---
They pay their artists by the pixel.
---
Aw but you might hurt Anet's feelings if you criticize them! Also I love this game still, it is the best game ever created, it's amazing! I totally don't keep telling myself that because I know deep inside it's far from the truth!
---
Rest in piece jaw line of steel.
---
Ease of use? ARC was such a pain in the ass to install and update patch after patch, not to mention it breaking, deleting gear, etc.
---
Beetle buff!
---
Thermal Tubes would't make much sense, since we are on a mountain and not on a volcano
---
But I agree with the rest!
---
Compared to this release the pof maps are replayable
---
Then when I went to fight it after first entering the new map, it died in like 20 seconds and didn't even have time to do all of its special attacks.
---
Will that get adjusted? **No.**
---
Yeah, but they decided to deliver less and didn't increase quality so far. Idk about you but the new meta is bland and the overall zone has little to no replay value. If they expand it with more nothingness I'm not sure if thats the way to go
---
That's not what OP said, disingenuous cunt.
---
We had thermal tubes in Bitterfrost Frontier. They were pressurized ice jets basically.
---
&gt;Gw2 uses the achievements as quests.
---
No it doesn't. "Do X part of the game under Y amount of time/while not getting hit/without letting anyone die" is not a quest.
---
Achievements have NEVER been content, not here, not in other MMOs and not in console gaming. Are you really going to tell me that winning X amount of PvP matches in FFXIV is "content" because there's an achievement tied to it? Or drinking every beer in WoW is perfect content because you gain an achievement from it? Of course not.
---
In this particular situation we kicked him 3 times and he canceled our lfg 3 times, even though our whole group has him on the blocklist.
---
Yeah,that's only the best part.
---
Why I think they should really consider adding a leaderboard for that type of stuff.
---
Lol, did you play the episode?
---
Well... actually, Sylvari were Mordremoth's minions and the Pale Tree his commander. On the other hand, Norns seem to be a non-Dragon bound race.
---
My guess is that the Icebrood Saga was planned to be an expansion, but a lot of the important people working on it were laid off/left. Remember that PoF was being developed while LWS3 was happening, and I can only assume the same thing was happening in LWS4.
---
&gt; I mean - it wasnt me
---
Oh crap. I'm sorry, I was on mobile and didn't notice!
---
Yes they laid off 20% of there staff and most of the OG's from gw1 left because gw3 is just around the corner!
---
Please use your brain 🙄
---
I love how you take ONE part of the grind and somehow try to use it to justify the rest of the grind. Well done there.
---
So removing rewards is "forcing to do other stuff"? Still weird...
---
Yikes. I didnt say they dont play meta, I said ours dont know what their buttons do. Watch the gameplay of their lead and you'll see him run his fingers across all utility skills repeatedly, often cancelling his own casts without realising.
---
This isnt "off meta". This is exceptionally bad. Literally spamming buttons without thinking about what they do for hundreds to thousands of hours.
---
The game allows you to be whatever you want, so you chose to be retarded. I guess that is the definition of fun.
---
While in school, take the chance to look up what criticism actually is.. because your post had none
---
Good luck tho
---
The numbers in that post weren't very helpful as it compared the active developers on WoW (excluding a bunch of support devs within Blizzard) and the credits of HoT, with some pretty vague definitions of what counted as a dev in that instance. Basically it compared two different definitions of what a dev is within two very different companies.
---
[ASMR] Jormag tucks you in as you fall asleep to keep bad things from happening
---
The two chests at the end , which you need to open with masteries, seem to be daily 
---
But unidentified gear and experience will be gained every kill.
---
Game is not more alive than ever. Maps are not more alive than ever. I know the mega map system is difficult to grasp but still.
---
Oh cool, then what similar kinds of games with more good content have you been busy with that you're using as a standard/comparison for GW2? I haven't found any that I enjoy as much, personally. So it's always nice to hear about some other good MMO's that I haven't tried.
---
Yup , you actually need a healbrand or a Druid to get the gold chest , and scourge is great in the fight too.
---
Ice what you did there
---
They made it cute so people feel safe spending money in the store, typical milking strategy.
---
Eir was killed solely to push Braham.  
---
Faolain was killed because lolMordrem and that's really it, there was little to no reaction from Caithe about it.  
---
Balthazar was butchered from his GW1 incarnation, same with Lazarus himself.
---
We can also included Belinda, Demmi, etc into that as characters who were introduced solely to be killed because it would push someone else.
---
The last person that actually died and was shocking was the damn Pact Partner and this was in the Personal Story. It was a death that stayed with you since even Zhaitan's minions would mention it.
---
no fun, game very alive
---
Lol, so many downvotes after pointing out a single statement. It looks like the forum was right and the reddit page is really the saltiest of the community banded together. Well, guess I will move back on forum. Enjoy your cry of dispairaround here, ignored by both anet and most of the community.
---
Normally end of January early February.
---
Yes, 2 week break after each story step. That way you will be prepared for another big content drop in 3 months.
---
Are the rewards decent?
---
Wow, someone's angry. Hina and Anet didn't give you anything this time?
---
How often do you switch builds lmao
---
Maybe he is talking about the icons a while back for a bunch of weapons?
---
It definitely felt weird [finding my dead brethren](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/623480215720427540/646512988576284673/unknown.png) everywhere...
---
So that's the way they're doing what they said. They claimed they'd reuse maps this time and release episodes quicker... so they just make half a map and an episode that's half as long.
---
I can't honestly say I'm not disappointed. It's completely obvious in retrospect, but it means their ~2 months cadence is basically a lie of omission. Content is going to be released just as fast as before, but in more frequent, smaller chunks.
---
Gotta say, "Well if you don't use the system that often, its flaws aren't that apparent" isn't exactly a ringing endorsement of the system.
---
Oh wow! Someone on the internet looks at porn! Stop the presses! Whats the world coming to?
---
here, take my downvote. 
---
so this post can never go anywhere.
---
keep on crying and keep on waiting, 7 years and counting..
---
and you are welcome xD
---
No mmos are currently garbage. I've been playing more competitive games, mobas and rts mostly. 
---
I'd love mmorpg style combat in a competitive setting. Unfortunately most competitive players left mmorpgs. Many of the remaining players are strongly against competition of any kind. As the mmo community grows more carebear (and smaller in general), the chance on a good mmo (for me in particular, but also in general) only declines.
---
And I'm ok with that, because this sub reminds me of the special kind of people that mmorpgs appeal to. Bonus points because they're driving their own game into the ground through the elitism they accuse everyone else of.
---
So I'm going to admit that I am currently subscribed to FFXIV, which I started playing to bridge the gap between GW2 updates. First thing, FFXIV and GW2 have extremely similar endgames. Story, raiding, fashion. However the way that FFXIV does updates ensures that people are still playing because the designers add rolling content after each major patch. For patch 5.1 they got a continuation of the story in the latest expansion, a 4-man dungeon, and a 24-man Alliance Raid, along with some fixes and tweaks to both combat and tradeskilling classes. Later they got patch 5.11 which added the first phase of a huge crafting-focused event and an 8-man hardcore raid.
---
In that same timeframe, GW2 got two short story updates, a fairly flawed implementation of a feature that should have been in the game from the start, a new mastery exclusive to the new map, and yet another endgame thing that may or may not replace fractals, which themselves were supposed to replace dungeons. At least the strikes are actually good and endlessly farmable, and these new ones are supposed to rotate out weekly which is a crucially important detail that will ensure people will be coming back to play them.
---
GW2 has the potential to be amazing, but they're still clinging to the idea that living world is enough. It's not enough.
---
The main difference is how fast they get released and how big the waiting times are. It is same story as with expansions, wait huge time and get big package, or get small packages along the time. 
---
That being said, if the fial product is same, it is better to do 2 months wait + 2 months wait than single 4 months wait. Similar with expansions, but that would be 2 years vs 6 x 3 months. Nobody will stay around 2 years of nothing. 
---
That being said, the important part to let this all work is that the final product has same amount of expected features.
---
&gt;I've already left the game. I'm here to be entertained by monkeys, and boy are the monkeys sure entertaining today.
---
So you admit to being a troll. I still don't know why the mods haven't banned you.
---
It was data mined months ago, before the prologue even launched. I don't remember the exact patch, but if you look into the things data mined throughout the patches, you'll see two runes pop up in one of those posts. All I remember is some people started getting all excited about it confirming elite specs totally 100% coming with the next living world update (which two have passed, so clearly didn't happen). Shit it's even possible it was just something from the legendary sigil and rune update that people jumped the gun on.
---
It's not something to get hype about. Runes don't mean elite specs.
---
Well I'm not saying I wasn't done in a couple hours, just that the 40 minutes seems like a bit of a hyperbole to me for the sake of trying to emphasize a point more
---
That's a great analogy because it's like all those people that think that posting complaints on social media is sticking it to the man, but stay at home during primaries and elections instead of voting. The game is far from dying. I see new players all the time. I still see tons of people doing HP trains, Teq, Octovine and other old content. It's just whiners like you that like to say the game is dying.
---
the weekly is just for the weekly rotation
---
No people did hype up over that too though.
---
This was specifically runes that where getting people all hot and bothered.
---
They need to focus on expansions going forward
---
I thought Jormag was just supposed to be a charming cult leader that can freeze stuff, not an actual mind controller. 
---
Wasn't mind control modremoth's domain?
---
Makes sense, here's hoping we don't have to wait too long to go there. With how small E1 is compared to the prologue part of me is hopeful that the wait between episodes that share a map will be fairly short (even if that means a slightly longer wait between pairs), but at the very least it should make hitting the 2-3 month target dead easy.
---
well,its indeed harder,but i still dont know single mechanic,since you can just roll him over.
---
ANet really seems to be trying to either push the narrative that Jormag lies and manipulates or that he/she/it legitimately seems to be benevolent and even knows something worse than the Elder Dragons is coming.
---
I don't understand i am new in the game but why should we trust this site? Is this official from the anet or just some rumours? Everyone here is full of panic and hate about the game. I spent many months to decide to start this game. Every mmorpg (different games) reddit that i visit, everyone has hate about the mmorpg game that he/she plays and then i understand that mmorpg community will destroy this kind. We should calm down i think, until some official statements from the company.
---
I've commented in a different place about this, but claiming it was done for "shock value" just because you don't understand the decision yet or what it does is dumb. That's not what "shock value" is. Shock value is really only used to make the audience feel afraid that any character they like could die. Almorrah had her main storyline resolved previously and several things hinted to her getting chopped. I think some people pointed to the Icebrood Charr in the trailer resembling her, but who knows just yet. 
---
We'll have to see what her death actually leads to and if they deliver on us actually investigated who did it and why.
---
Probably elementalist. He shrugs off electricity because magnetism is just one expression of it and his powers is just basically making stuff float the way he wants if there is enough metal in it. Iron dust in rocks, the actual electrons of Water. Fire is probably mini atom splitting.
---
The only problem is getting metallic weighty armor for Light Armor class.
---
Also for amusement: https://i.imgur.com/Nzev6fu.mp4
---
Also looking for some content feedback, but here it is drowned in a see of complaint - maybe there should be a separate sub for optimistic people?
---
Since it's on the 25th for Chinese New Year.. guessing it would probably start the 14th and go until 4th.
---
Sure I could use some help and company :) my username ingame is the same as my reddit. Daviskei
---
I finished they story cant find the feed the bear in the panel
---
Already deleting your post? Yikes.
---
You post inflammatory stuff, try to get responses, delete your own post and then attempt to frame it in a way others are trolling?
---
Yeah I suppose I shouldn't call people retards... but holy shit you most definitely are one.
---
Enjoy the forum, where you get a warning if you dare to use logic, and banned the second you say something negative
---
It's not that we are whining over free stuff, it's that most of us would much rather pay for an expansion or for **something** than to be fed pitiful scraps every couple of months.
---
I meant story-wise. The visuals and atmosphere are a delight and the story is much darker which I prefer.
---
Mighty is the foe who, after being bested, convinces the hero to retreat and surrender victory
---
I can. Creating skills is one of the most fun and rewarding tasks in developing an ARPG. Sure, Weaver has plenty, but if you don't enjoy the process, what are you doing in that team?
---
RIP in peace
---
"Loves charr" has no right of being there.
---
Should be "human female meta"
---
What the hell is that face???
---
U can say "when I use to play it was". U can't complain on how it is now or that content is too few or not enough. 
---
That is why they do not interact with us anymore
---
So what would you rather have then? An environment that's dishonestly positive? There's always the walled garden of the official forums if that's what you want.
---
I'll take honest discussion about the game and it's flaws any day over the alternative. If you take criticism about something you like as a personal attack that's on you. You're allowed to enjoy things that other people dislike and you're also allowed to dislike things that other people enjoy.
---
Unknowingly bored out people are a self-fullfilling prophecy - they scare people because they rant about the game all the time, less people play the game, there is less revenue to support the game, the game is updated less and less giving them all the more reason to rant.
---
If you bought it off the TP, it wouldn't count as buying it from the vendor, which appears to be the specific trigger.
---
Achieves and collections Are what bore me to death.
---
Stupid way to make people replay the same shit over and over. Lame as fuck imo.
---
Where's the spoiler exactly?
---
we got cook 500, legendary runes and sigils, build templates and strike missions, and the seasons has just started.
---
"Hates humans" doesn't belong here for as long as human female meta exists.
---
I think the vast majority agree that we love the game. The game is great. It's next-level.
---
However, it could be SO MUCH MORE. There is so much potential in GW2 and it just seems like Arenanet don't want to grasp it and make it the WoW-killer that it could be. That's why we're frustrated.
---
We play the game because we love the game. We complain because it could so easily be even better than it is now.
---
You realize the mods are deleting my posts and yours? Just look at my profile and you'll still see them. Just like I can still see yours.
---
&gt; Are the BSF rifts or Kralk's variants signs of this "collapse"?
---
No. Those were made by the Bloodstone explosion. And Kralk with Balthazar magic.
---
&gt;The confusing part for me is what exactly Glint's plan was between the two games. If the eggs were already gone replacing the EDs before they rise wasn't going to happen and 3-5 of them would destroy civilisation almost as effectively as the full 6. So she'd need to change plans instead of clinging to this now incomplete Scion plan.
---
3 wouldn't nearly be as destructive and could theoretically be maintained in hibernation. But you hit the issue of adding a plot halfway through development of a new plot. There will inevitably be holes. Glint's plan rested solely on the existence of her and her scions. In theory, the Forgotten have more plans with the Six.
---
Also gotta keep in mind she was more focused on just taking down Kralkatorrik, and spent 3,000 years mostly on finding means to help mortals fight him specifically.
---
QUICK! HE’S TRYING TO EDUCATE HIMSELF!
---
&gt;People have spent thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars on this game
---
So what you are saying is that you go all that entertainment for about 10 cents an hour. I wish movies were like this. I could get movie tickets for 25 cents.
---
100/1000 = 1/10 = 0.1 
---
so x/2.5(hours) 
---
so x = 0.25 by that comparison
---
So. . . what you're saying is none of them were killed for shock value, they were killed to develop a story thread for a different character or otherwise died in a way that you and others don't quite think was valuable. Are we in agreement? 
---
I'm really curious what people think is a good example of a character death? This is a story full of war and destruction, it should not be surprising that sometimes a main character dies in a way that is unceremonious and basically a downer. 
---
As far as your points on each character, I have no disagreements over Balthazar and Lazarus, I especially hated what they did with Lazarus. I agree on Belinda being developed just to die but not Demmi, who was introduced long before her death and was involved in uncovering ministry and White Mantle shenanigans. Caithe not getting all emotional over Faolain was odd but not that out of character for Caithe who generally doesn't show outward emotions when people she cared about die. She's probably the one character they've dealt with most consistently in this regard (from Wynne, to Eir, to Faolain, to Trahearne, to Aurene. Caithe just isn't about shedding tears).
---
&gt; first episode in the Saga, not an expansion. 
---
Sure. Except they deliberately sold us this idea of LW seasons replacing expansions by stating that seasons would include expansion level content and quality.
---
And this misses the ball by a long shot. The quality is a hit or miss. It's a hit in the story but it's insanely short, even by LW standards. 
---
&gt; Stop crying and expecting all these things from an EPISODE of FREE CONTENT!
---
Just because it's free that doesn't mean they can be lazy. The lazier they get, the less and less they do, the less reasons players will have to invest in their game. Less investments means less resources to actually do that expansion you so very much want.
---
I'm one of the firsts to jump and find a good reason to back up some of the decisions A-Net makes but this, well, I love the story and it was really good this episode but the entire release left a sour feeling my mouth.
---
Even the map felt empty and not because it's a desolate snow land but because it just felt, well, empty. I rarely found a lot of people which was rare given previous track records. Even Grothmar Valley had more people running about.
---
And the new mastery, sounds great on paper but to be honest, I don't want to be playing rock, paper, scissors, with my combat. Running into a chest and realizing I have the paper to the scissors chest. Forcing me to run across the map to get rock instead and on the way needing scissors because there are chests near rock.
---
Nothing about this release persuaded me to believe that Season 5 is going to be a proper replacement for expansions. To sell that idea, you need to really back it up.
---
But they said this will be equal of expansion. And right after episode 1 we know it won't be :)
---
I really like how generous they are with the new currency. But then again, everything worth buying can be pretty much bought in a day.
---
Oh well, we'll probably get some kind of a sink as the season goes on, and Anet will expand the map so the currency probably is usable there too.
---
Well yeah, I think everyone would rather have an expansion.  I'd rather give a company like ANet my money for good content, but the fact is, nothing like this is ready yet.  I just hate people who keep complaining that any new content isn't what they want.  Anet seems keenly aware that we want an expansion, but this is what they've got ready now.  Its the same thing every time something new drops.  The Dev's worked hard on this, they were fixing bugs right up to the wire, and its so annoying seeing people trashing content the day after it comes out.
---
I was right. I does look different. At first I though it was a beaver. Guild mate from New Zealand though it was a sheep.
---
except theyre not wrong in this case. you cant call people crybabies when theyre right and have valid arguments and criticisms.
---
For many, it's not about nothing to do, but the kind of content Anet produces now.
---
The vicious circle is the casual community attacking every type of gameplay that isnt their preferred casual style until it no longer exists...
---
And then being surprised it doesnt lead to a growing, healthy community. 
---
Pvp is a minority and should be removed. Wvw too. Raids too. Fractals too. Rp too. Guilds also. Anything non challenging is completed by more people than anything challenging, so it's a waste!!! But it turns out pvp, wvw, raids, rpers, guilds, ... together were likely a majority of the games population.
---
Shit is pretty hilarious to be honest. We killed diversity because EVERYTHING must be catered to everyone.
---
We're not at the start of the vicious circle. We're already past the point of no return. I have accepted this. Anet will not, ever, grow gw2 to the game it could be. They will continue to reduce their output while milking money and move on. I'm merely here to watch the viscous circle come all the way around to the point where this toxic casual community half realises they've been eating their own tail all along. Or consumes itself in denial. I like pvp, after all.
---
&gt; They realized people will leave raids sooner or later
---
Well, if there's less than 1 new wing per year.. Yeah.
---
How about this. You buy a hotdog from a stand. 2 years later, the stand guy recognizes you as the person who launched his now global franchise and gives you a free hotdog. Is that hotdog free? Yes, even though you only received it because you spent money 2 years ago. This is literally the exact same type of free. Would you call that hotdog free?
---
Feedback from any source is biased.  The people who give feedback are mostly people that have a complaint.  Few people actually think about giving positive feedback (because they aren't driven by emotion to do so).
---
The bad reviews tell what people *feel* (they were wronged or feel duped) and carry a lot more weight due to the negative emotion (think Darth Vader choking someone).  The good reviews carry emotion as well (they want to help others or they were overly happy with the investment) but in my experience they can be overly simplistic or lack detailed information.
---
My rule of thumb (the "Rule to CockGobblin") is that you take 5/7ths of bad reviews and 3/7ths of good reviews when determining whether a product has good quality.  Throw 1/8 out the window and flip a quarter - heads you become a fanboy/girl, tails you boycott the company.
---
Does he/she though? Every Dragon seems to have a personality and i kinda doubt Jormag's is just Mordremoth's "i want to manipulate everyone to make minions" but with Ice.
---
Kralkatorikk's final moments and this odd pushing of the narrative that Jormag might not actually be as evil as we were led to believe \[and Jormag flatout saying that something might be coming and the Commander would actively need them\] seem to imply there's something worse than the Elder Dragons.  
---
After all, Kralk did mention a Mother, so someone must have created them to maintain the magical balance of Tyria.
---
Just because someone worked on something hard, I'm not obliged to like it or appreciate it. Work smart, not hard.
---
It's called The Hunger
---
No no no, you've got it all wrong. You have your pawns wear the human leather clothing, make kibble out of the meat and sell excess organs.
---
I liked it too.
---
Exactly. They don't need to work hard. They just need to manage their game the RIGHT way. Stop trying to invent the wheel every year and stick to a fucking plan.
---
I liked the last one a lot more :(
---
&gt;Jormag probably feared the powers some norn
---
Then he/she would've actively tried to destroy them from within, kinda like what happened in the start of this Episode. There seems to be a bit of a narrative push that Jormag knows something bad is coming, something even the Elder Dragons might fear.
---
Wow that was amazingly well said.
---
Ngl the last remaining vista is triggering me
---
StOp CrYiNg iTs fReE cOnTeNt
---
Manupulation seems to be something they ALL have, it's just much stronger on some like Mordremoth \[who could invade the mind directly\] and Jormag \[who uses persuasion and suggestions, similar to Mass Effect's Reapers\].
---
Don’t you think Anet would of already fixed that glitch in character selection that overexposes your characters in their icons
---
The irony of this post.
---
Everyone on this subreddit hates GW2 and shouldn't be listened too. But here is some advice that you should listen to...
---
Yeah I'm not saying hard work= good work.  I'm saying that a new map full of dynamic events, new Masteries, new weapons set, new bosses, a good story, and three new strikes missions= Good work.
---
He's no longer looking down on us at least.
---
Which is fair! I understand that people will use this sub to vent their complaints, but I hate the idea that some players are deciding to just skip the new release because of negative comments they saw here. I think people should play and decide for themselves since it's, ya know, free. That was my main point.
---
The map feels incredibly empty without repeatable hearts. There’s just random events that pop up, And I don’t think there is a meta event? 
---
It worked with Grothmar Valley (especially since the events were varied in tasks) but it sure as hell didn’t work for Bjora Marches.
---
I'm aware oh anal one.
---
No, that's what you consider good work. Your opinion is not a fact.
---
Well, I think Anet has said they are able to shorten the gap between episodes this season, so if the gap is closer to one month than two or three, I think the smaller amount of content per patch is justified.
---
And to the people who keep complaining about 'no content' and log in a few times a year to play the latest patch and then log off, why even bother? Clearly this game doesn't cater to your needs, so wouldn't it be better to just find a different one altogether?
---
First time I hear about it (shrug) go be angry somewhere A-Net actually reads.
---
My best bet is a mobile GW1 with cash shop.
---
[Here is an overview of the map](https://i.imgur.com/mN79Aaj.png). There's currently nothing on the left side of it.
---
Just shut this shit show down. Game is trash.
---
The story is insanely short. 
---
If a Living World Episode was a chapter in a book, then 'Whisper in the Dark' was about only four pages in a chapter. 
---
I'm glad you enjoyed it; the tone is well done and the map is neat. But people are allowed to be disappointed.
---
Found the fanboy.
---
*Laughs in necro*
---
&gt;Well, I think Anet has said they are able to shorten the gap between episodes this season, so if the gap is closer to one month than two or three, I think the smaller amount of content per patch is justified.
---
It's not when they actively pushed the fact it would have "Expansion-level content". That and it having less content doesn't really fit.
---
where is the entrance on the new map?
---
I'll need the numbers too! Mine is Moonbutt.6950
---
My advice was literally "decide for yourself", I fail to see how that's contradictory.
---
yea, better to listen to the players who have 20 hours in than the vets who have been playing since day 1 /s
---
[everyone liked that]
---
They thought the OP was a farmer and needed help loading the hay onto his wagon.
---
Anet literally said expansion level content.
---
Ty it was locked until i found the dude
---
Spoilers: There is [nothing behind that door](https://i.imgur.com/6ae83hO.png).
---
He linked it in guild chat first, probably, then he just go back in history of his messages by pressing down/up button in active chat window. Sadly it doesnt work with all sorts of links to waypoints or items.
---
LOL, love that.
---
Them dying out of nowhere solely as the narrative push for another character is horrible storytelling, even more so when they're either iconic or have been there from the beginning. It shows that ANet had no idea how to push these characters, so they just killed them off.  
---
Eir died solely to act as Braham's  narrative push and Faolin barely got a reaction from Caithe through it all, you'd expect that the fact someone she lives, someone she used to be willing to fall into Nightmare for, was turned into a Mordrem would affect her heavily from there on, but she kinda brushed it off and this never seems to have affected her \[you'd think that Caithe's later connection with Aurene might have her remember Faolin, but not even that happened\].
---
Only death back then that made sense was Trahearne since he was corrupted directly by Mordremoth.
---
Most of this sub would have paid good money for good content about a year ago but the way Anet has been lately, I'll never give this company another dime.  A year ago, I would have thrown them hundreds of dollars for WvW or Raids or Fractals
---
I did it with elementalist. Saw the ‘fog’ of the boss and directly lightning flashed towards it. Had to try it 3 times though. But it is pretty easy:)
---
Excuse me but are you trying to imply that Sw/Sh isn't a massive disappointment on almost every possible level ?  Bc to me you sound like someone who hasn't looked into the games at all.
---
&gt; I don't understand **i am new in the game**
---
That's probably why you don't understand, you're new to the game. Many people have been playing since launch in 2012, has been supporting the games, throwing money at it, getting invested in it... Only to feel ignored.
---
Build template being one example, it doesn't really offer what was needed on top of being limited and heavily monetized. Players have been giving strong feedbacks for a while and not even half of it was adressed by the company.
---
The lack of upcoming elite specs that would revigorate the gameplay. They made the choice to replace a planned expansion with the icebrood saga... But it doesn't quite deliver what an expansion would. PoF introduced 5 new maps, 5 mounts and 9 elites *all at once*. Whisper in the Dark offered what? A small story.
---
For new players, GW2 with expansions is mindblowingly good. Like, *really really good*, but for veterans eventually you just hit a wall... And this could have been prevented with more fractals, more raids, etc., but we're not getting any of that anytime soon.
---
&gt; until some official statements from the company.
---
We'll wait forever. Arenanet is not the kind to be very talkative.
---
Character dies there’s only one npc mini in the story achieves. Spoiled it for me :(
---
How many people in the company are actually working on the game?  100 people could means 80 non-dev (support, management, whatever their marketing does) and 20 devs (art/graphics/model, audio/voice/music, programming).
---
Yeah, the he, was me. Total bruh moment. And yeah you for it absolutely spot on 😂.
---
&gt;but claiming it was done for "shock value" just because you don't understand the decision yet or what it does is dumb. 
---
No it's not, it's me thinking something is extremely stupid because i was not given a reason to understand why it was done. IF there is a reason, i now have to wait MONTHS to find out.
---
&gt; We'll have to see what her death actually leads to and if they deliver on us actually investigated who did it and why. 
---
And they won't deliver, it should beyond obvious at this point that ANet will not deliver.
---
2 months  late cuz dead game - but are you actually this stupid?  
---
A. GW2 doesn't fully utilize your GPU, it uses your CPU.
---
B. That's the broken ass shitty facial animation THEY DESIGNED into the model. NO settings of graphics are going to FIX that shit.   
---
C. My settings are on max you actual troglodyte.
---
The "epic" bossfight was also very obviously beyond what Anet was capable of handling.
---
It had weird glitches where you'd get killed by getting to close to Kralk, would respawn in bad positions that forced you to kill yourself over and over to get a correct respawn that allowed you to continue and to top it off, most respawns would break achievements. The achievement icon would still be there, but credit wouldnt be given.
---
Also: 
---
- dying to collapsing walls blown up by the dredge (and respawning wrong multiple times after that)
---
- dredge not showing up, breaking the instance
---
- random crystals popping up to funnel you to the 3rd fight not working or locking you in
---
And all got most of these multiple times despite playing the instance only 3 times in total.
---

---
Could have made a crosspost.
---
Anet Dev's have specifically said they are not ruling out expansions.  Yes they said that this "Saga" will have Expac level features, I take that to mean they are adding more to the living world episodes, not taking away expansions.  There are no other episode has had strike missions, or (arguably) the same level of map content (Boneskinner, Abberants, fallen, meta, Masteries, etc.)
---
I don't think that free content= laziness?  Nor do I think anything about this particular episode was indicative of laziness.  Again, the story was short, but I had the realistic expectation that the story would only be around a day's playthrough.  It was very detailed, there was a ton of unnecessary but cool ambient dialogue, and the choices you make in Raven's temple were morally intriguing.  I could immediately tell there was a lot of work put it here. 
---
As far as the map being empty, I know everyone's experience is different, but mine was full of people on launch.  I hopped into the first strike mission, I killed 3/5 of the "Hunts" and everyone was very helpful in doing map events.  I didn't go to Grothmar last night, but that's a really good map too, I'm glad they're both doing well.
---
As far as the mastery goes, I haven't completed them all, but I agree so far it's been a little problematic from a chest perspective.  I do like the idea of using them in combat though, as it adds an extra dynamic.  
---
Overall, I think it was very good and I don't think it deserves the hate it gets.
---
and what do you think season 3 and 4 are? are they not an expansion **in their entirety**?
---
RIPIP in peace
---
Not necessarily mind control, per se. The way I understand it is that Mordremoth and Mordrem are like a hive species with Mordremoth acting as the hivemind but Mordremoth could never really communicate with races that weren't Mordrem or Sylvari. And while Mordremoth will occasionally try and manipulate or tempt its targets, it's not its go to strategy. Mordremoth will gaslight the shit out of you, he would implant ideas into Sylvari and make them believe they were their own thoughts. Mordremoth was also quite forceful with the mental intrusions with it being described akin to heavy force being pushed down against their mind.
---
Jormag's approach is different. Jormag isn't trying to get direct mental control over people's minds the way that Mordermoth was. Jormag is seductive, manipulative and controlling, but it's not a brute force kind of control. Jormag as an archetype is more like a stereotypical depiction of the devil trying to cut a deal for someone's soul. So there's a lot of seductive promises and mindfuckery to unbalance the target and make them susceptible to manipulation. This is how Jormag corrupts and manipulates and it's always been mentally, it's just not really mind control in the way that way that comes to mind with regards to like Mordremoth. The absorption of Mordremoth's power by Jormag doesn't give Jormag mind control abilities as much as it gives Jormag an enhanced ability to communicate and reach targets to seduce. As far as I understand it, Mordremoth's powers essentially gave Jormag the equivalent of a long range transmitter so Jormag can now target people like Bangar would previously wouldn't have been accessible.
---
You can do the strike again after you've got the masteries and the two chests will be there for you to open even if you did the strike once already
---
lol im not angry. anger would mean i still care. but i dont give a fuck and it doesnt suprise me at all.. which is even worse then being angry
---
I even flatout said
---
&gt;  as you always do to hide the failings of this game, 
---
and somehow he still didn't get it.
---
There's also daily chests in there with the metal thing you need for the new weapons + other loot like map resources so it's not a complete awful investment. Only takes like 5-10 minutes or so right?
---
So it's good content if you play 1h a week? Kay got it.
---
Gotta free up some space for that "homework" folder ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
We don't know what Jormag truly wants or what their intentions are at all. There are big unknowns here in terms of the dragon's motivation; there's conflicting reports in the little lore books sprinkled around the map. I for one love the sense of doubt and paranoia they're sowing into the map, and while it's not blatant Eldritch horror, they very heart of Lovecraft's work certainly tackled the idea that things aren't always what they seem.
---
We know what Jormag is, but we don't know WHO they are. That to me is the "Lovecraft"ian aspect of this story patch.
---
&gt;His post is talking about a specific group of people downvoting the post.  
---
Yes, my post, about the game and what's happening on it. Which is on topic.
---
You're really confirmed hard that you're one of the people i was talking about.
---
You really don't know which golem I'm talking about, don't you?
---
This is still messed up for me as well.  Teleported to a friend which is fine but I can't finish if I don't board the stupid g^#&amp;#*#&amp; plane!  Pleaaaaase fix it 😭
---
Shocker! I expressed my opinion in a post about my opinion of a content release?!? Someone please alert the authorities.  You're entitled to your opinion, but when you complain about a subscription-free game that is providing you with a ton of free content without any substantive criticism it just makes you sound whiny.
---
It's also much, much shorter. It's like 5 minutes of content once a week. I don't see how this adds much to the game. The content is fine but there is no depth to it all at.
---
ppl literally complained of getting a new map with every release, becuase it would thin out the population too much.
---
&gt;Anet Dev's have specifically said they are not ruling out expansions. 
---
I'm glad they said this AFTER saying "screw expansions" and doing another Season of LS. :)
---
well.. i know its sarcasm and its kinda funny but i still downvote you because i hate SAB.
---
Black Lyin' Lion
---
Must be science class, huh
---
Yeah, I think it had some issues too, mainly with the masteries and the amount of people needed to do the dynamic events, but overall it was a good release.  I think people would be less upset with the length of the story if there was a hard and fast release schedule, but the length of the story was about the same as other living world episodes.  My issue is with people who are saying "Anet has disappointed me for the last time... uninstalling." The episode was good, its ok to be unhappy with it, and it's ok to want more.  But people think its cool to hate on something new.
---
That was probably some devs project for the month.
---
TBH, he did need his mane fluffed.
---
Took some tries for a random squad to beat it. Nice difficulty. More please.
---
I keep the game installed so that I can log in, grab the episode, and then log back out. Eventually after a year and a half I'll have a sizeable amount of content to come back to if I ever get bored of playing other games.
---
&gt;Then saith He, "Lift up thy weapons. For you are my soldiers, and must you be steadfast, strong, and brave of heart. They who neither hesitate nor stumble shall be rewarded. Then shall you have glory. Then shall your deeds be remembered for eternity." 
---
Courage, determination, the honor of battle. Not "fighting for fighting's" sake, or "the god of mass murder. With nuance, sure, as he was said to have committed some atrocities.
---
This should put into perspective how few people are likely working on gw2.
---
AND I GOT STUCKED IN LAST PART,RAVEN WONT LET ME IN. 10/10
---
All companies test their software.  Only some companies have the luxury of testing in a QA environment instead of in production.
---
Feels like first new map we got in megumma desert. Map blocked off.
---
Weaver wasn't the only thing they were supposed to finish before the PoF deadline. 
---
This isn't about enjoyment, it's about 50 new skills being overkill if they're all for just 1/9 elite specs, they themselves merely one aspect of PoF.
---
Did you forget that this seasons updates are supposed to be smaller?
---
WvW Alliances got delayed by another 3 months so that the team could finish this
---
Yes. So?
---
of course there's nothing, the map is not completed yet.
---
Nope. Would you like to inform me so I have some idea what you’re talking about?
---
In math your entire subject is to prove those old formulas again. I mean that's what you do in math major courses.
---
I’m on a Mac Pro 12 core Xeon workstation with 64 GB of RAM and dual FirePro 6GB GPUs. The highest frame rate I’ve achieved since they swapped to their ‘native’ client, is about 5fps. That’s with everything turned down, and sub sampling on, while running in a small Windows. Back when they used Cider, I had a tolerable 30-45fps, and in Boot Camp I stay around 60fps with D912pxy. At this point I’ve resigned to rebooting any time I want to play this one game.
---
Jim in accounting didn't like it.  Tracy (Henry's wife; Henry is from Janitorial Services) says it looks too tough and the game needs softer icons.  Jennifer said the icon looks like a male sexist lion and Anet should burn in hell.  These 3 people made Anet change the icon.
---
Great. Ty I'll do this night
---
Bruh, I am one of those persons who run requiem and mistborn suits but it is not because of their superior design. It is because they are one of the few sets in game that have half way decent visuals that I can actually (painstakingly) achieve by grinding a map for rewards. Sure I'd love to have some of the celestial, obnoxious outfits but I refuse to give 1 single cent to this company after the course they have decided to take after POF.
---
It became a tradition to link the items in map chat before continuing to mystic forge. I love this ritual :D
---
Wow, next chapter will be even smaller than this one!
---
Are you being obtuse on purpose? Cause this comment only proves you dont grasp what theyre complaining about. 
---
Youre not even arguing the thing he is talking about. 
---
Nobody is complaining that we have to pay to get stuff, but they are saying that it is not free, like that other dude is saying it is.
---
Hahaha hahaha ha (cry)
---
Whiteknight arenanet harder please.
---
Josh is no longer with Anet so don't bet on new sab content... 💔

I could immediately tell there was a lot of work put it here. 
---
You are completely missing the point. Details is NOT content. A-Net has always been one for attention to details in their map designs but that doesn't mean they're doing a proper job of managing their game the way they are supposed to. 
---
That's been a problem since day 1.
---
All previous maps have had the same level of content as Bjora Marches. They all had multiple type s of mobs, bosses, champions, etc. Everything you listed was in every Living World map before it. 
---
Of course no other episodes had strike missions. Because those are exclusive to Season 5. That's like saying "Well yeah, no other Season had your character do voice lines." or "No other episode had the beetle."
---
Strike Missions aren't anything special. At all! They're super bare bone raid encounters. There's no adventure to them. There's no puzzle. They have nothing but a single boss fight. Difficulty aside, that's just lazyness. They could have taken that idea and have re-introduced DUNGEONS. Remember the Raven Temple? That would have been a perfect place to set up a dungeon that you can tackle with a group every day and it ends in a fun boss fight. That boss could rotate weekly with rotating loot tables and a universal currency you can accumulate to buy stuff from a vendor.
---
But no. That's not what they decided to do.
---
&gt; Anet Dev's have specifically said they are not ruling out expansions. Yes they said that this "Saga" will have Expac level features, I take that to mean they are adding more to the living world episodes, not taking away expansions.
---
Going back to this point. I never said they ruled out expansions for good. But, they're definitely not working on one anytime soon, they're not even working on raids or fractals, stuff you would expect IN AN EXPANSION. They doubled down on the Saga idea if more than anything. And if they're adding more to living world episodes, then where is that "more"? Because we got less than a season 3 episode. And I don't mean the map as a whole. The map is meant to expand with episode 2 in January/February. But everything else you can consider to be content is missing. Both instanced and not instanced. Oh, we got a whole weapon set to craft. OK. Where's an armor set? Where are the unique, specific weapons that fit the theme of the release like the Raven lens which is clearly a scepter? Why isn't there a specific Raven themed weapon? Or armor piece? Hell, even another emote. A Raven chair.
---
Why don't the NPCs discover a new variation of the Springer or any other base mount in the map for us to train or unlock or whatever? Why not include some new way to glide based on Raven? Why not include a progressive rewards system that you work with by doing a min-dungeon in a cave or in the Mists with Raven?
---
A-Net is lazy. They have 300 employees and all they can do is this much? If they're not working on raids, fractals, or even legendary weapons and definitely not on an expansion, then what are they doing?
---
Yeah, their quality is top notch. Everything on that map looks great, their cinematics are once again superb. But good looks alone isn't enough to keep anyone invested in a video game. Much less persuade them to invest into the game by making purchases. And the gem store alone won't persuade everyone.
---
Definition of Patronize: "treat in a way that is apparently kind or helpful but that betrays a feeling of superiority"
---
I'm not patronizing or being condescending to your or others.  I'm expressing my opinion that the episode was good, and that others are allowed to have other opinions.   My point is that people who are upset that this episode didn't include things like raids, fractals, etc. (or are just hating something that's new) have unrealistic expectations for a LW episode.
---
Why is it also in a different order than before?
---
The "it's free" argument is stale and has never been functional.  
---
The logic you're using is that this is somehow a gift they're giving to us and therefore should be appreciated no matter the shortcomings - but that isn't what it is, for us or for anet.  The game has no subscription model and isn't releasing paid expansions.  They need revenue to keep the lights on, and they need to keep players engaged in their game in order to feel motivated to spend money in the gemstore.  
---
Every time they release underwhelming content that doesn't engage players, those players take another break.  Players on break don't spend money.  It's bad marketing and zero revenue, which makes the criticism of "free content" **very much their concern** and not something to be shushed.
---
Lifehack: dont go on reddit if you want to avoid spoilers

And his newphew was Sonic the Hedgehog all the time, as we see on new pic.  Plot twist!
---
Agreed. I have a decently old (mid 2012 non Retina) Macbook Pro, and back in \~2014, I had a windows partition through BootCamp. It was alright, got decent frames at fairly OK settings, better with some visual concessions.
---
Got a regular home PC where I do most of my gaming now, and after the Mac client went out of beta, I got rid of the entire partition and switched to using the native client when needed. I've had to drop my quality settings considerably to get sometimes consistently-playable framerates.
---
It'll do in a pinch, but leaves a lot to be desired, for sure.
---
Unfortunately, I think the dagger is literally the same size as the sword.
---
Sorry, no positivity allowed here.
---
"Why doesn't anet communicate with us?"
---
"You SAID expansion level content!  That's what YOU SAID!!!!  WHERE"S THE EXPANSION LEVEL CONTENT YOU PROMISED ME!!!!!!!!!!!"
---
How? When I went back after completing the last instance nothing was happening when I approached the first totem.
---
MO
---
No, I just think this particular makes people with it, in my opinion, a whiny loser. It all depends on the complaint. Every time I see anyone on here have a positive opinion about the game they get called white knights, schills, fanboys, idiots and whatever else just because they didn't jump on the hate train with them. There is even a person who made a comment about how they were about to get out their pitch forks because they thought it was somebody who liked the new content. But yeah, it's us people who aren't haters that are the bad guys here, right? Why couldn't we just let you hate, right? Just like how all the haters jump on every post from a new player about how much they love this game to spew their hate for the game at the person? Right?
---
Seems like doing the story mission counts as finishing the maze, but the big chests aren't there in the instance for obvious reasons.
---
To be honest the main problem with GW2 isn't the jump from the type of content.
---
The first main problem is the jump from changing from a bad build to a decent build. In FFXIV it's more or less impossible to have bad gear or a bad build because these things do not exist there. GW2 has way too many "traps" in this department. I really don't know how they can change it at this point. One possible solution I can think of would be a complete rework of all gear stats by making them more "similar" in the way that you don't lose a lot of damage by choosing the wrong one and by reworking the skills and traits so even if you randomly pick them you still can do a decent job. But as you can already see this would be a lot of work and might upset a lot of people whos favorite build has been changed.
---
Also when speaking about FFXIV you have to remember that it uses the same effects and markers for the same mechanics in dungeons, trials and raids. If you play through the main story in FFXIV you get to know a lot of the mechanics used in the harder versions of trials and raids by playing through the story dungeons and trials. You usually only have to learn a few encounter specific mechanics combined with the usual mechanics you already know. They created a really good "learning curve" which GW2 sadly doesn't have.
---
Reddit is just insanely negative about everything. People who actually enjoy the game don't even come on here anymore. It's a release that's come out in half the time we're used to expecting, and although it may suffer a bit from that, it's no better or worse than anything to be expected from season 4. You're free to wait, and that might not be a bad idea, but please, don't get your episode first impressions from this dumpster fire of a website. 
---
I pity the devs who work hard on a release and come on this website to see nothing but a middle finger in their face.
---
Sorry but it's not free. Sure they give it to people for free when it releases up until the next "episode" goes live but if you come to the game after the window you have to pay for it. Also, if people all stopped buying items in the cash shop the first thing they would do is charge premium for this content. 
---
This studio is capable of more. They rarely ever deliver it, that is laziness IMO.
---
So... Sword/dagger thief and ranger can get a cool dual wield look going?
---
SH is a hard boss!
---
That’s true if your entire play loop is SM. I think this is what ANet is trying to funnel players into. PvE open world, achieve grinds, and SM. Lack of support for isolated game modes like Dungeons, Fractals, and Raids is pretty telling.
---
Now *this* is expansion worthy content!
---
Thanks all!
---
Heey, they unlocked it!
---
"Hold my b.... Actually I'll be done with this pretty quick."
---
Living world historically provided more raids than expansion. Do some research.
---
Well it sounded like they expected something behind the door.
---
I already expected her to be dead. Once I heard her message for the commander to get to Bjora Marches, I already knew she was gone. The voice even had this icy cracking effect that if you're not good at picking up sound queues, you would easily mistake it as the charr guttural sound they make.
---
Sweet. This is my jam. GJ!
---
Heck Alexander has been re-used like 4 times by now and everyone still loves him. It's just a clever use of resources tbh. GW2 really should do that.
---
Technically the road to grothmar goes through the first strike mission
---
GW Immortal. 
---
You have phones, don’t you?
---
why does the first game character screen look million times better than what we have now
---
and the rewards are...
---
&gt; even by LW standards.
---
I feel LS3E1 was a bit worse (if not equally) though. The map was even smaller, the story was somewhat short, and there was nothing that meaningful to unlock. Afaik (according to the wiki page) it didn't give any new raid nor fractal neither.
---
I think people was more forgiving for it considering it took time for HoT to be updated and fixed and it was also the true first episode of the new official rotation between LS and expansion...
---
But as a first episode of a saga that is meant to replace an expansion, this is extremely lackluster.
---
I did the story and dicked around in the map so I am not sure what you mean by this... what do you mean by this lol?
---
I thought I was being paranoid, thanks
---
&gt; you should**n't** play it anyway
---
Learn to read correctly..
---
Nice. I love a good NPC-PC
---
They could bring Josh back. I mean, he is still jobless as far as I know...
---
Its his cousin that worked for disney before.
---
I personally found the new launcher rather depressing to look at. The previous changes to the launcher we associated with expansions but now we are just getting only the launcher with nothing to look forward to other than being drip-fed small story updates (which has already been happening for years). Now no new raids, fractals, legendary weapons, elite specs, expansions or anything particularly exciting for WvW or PvP are coming in the near future. And on top of all that they ruined their most requested and anticipated QoL feature so they could aggressively monetize it (templates). Why should I feel anything but sad when I see that we got a new launcher that represents nothing?
---
oh the irony
---
You have to be subtle when doing those things. Jormag can't take the wheel and control everyone with a hive mind like Mordremoth.
---
Jormag's method is more like putting people to sleep. Shake things too much, and they wake up and fight back.
---
What an ass hole!
---
A more fluffy icon invites people to click it and by consequence swipe the credit card and get some gems................
---
I've noticed the same lack of ascended seeds from crucible after this update.
---
I suspect that they never 'intended' for crucible to 'proc' herb node rewards.  I still see peppercorns, mint and such but no ascended versions.
---
Same, really. 
---
The Christmas mini raid (which is basically a strike mission) is what made me go from never raiding to giving it a try.
---
I don't even have my roller beetle cause all I do is WvW. :(
---
Or Weaver, for a weapon loadout that isn't split between power and condi.
---
I thought "hates humans" meant actual human beings and I was like "aren't you taking it a bit far?".
---
ah yes because eye-candy + story-writing = gameplay time
---
Exactly my point, there are options to get the function of legendary from pvp and wvw, but the “skin” of legendary armor from pve comes from the “endgame” of pve content and holds that prestige, in a game all about fashion wars that’s not a bad thing, you don’t have to have access to everything just because you want it. In most/all game modes there are unique items that show a level of dedication if not skill persay in that particular area. Anet has clearly shown that the transformation effect on raid armor is special as they didn’t add it to pvp or wvw stuff. If you want the shiny then do what it takes, don’t expect the be handed the shiny just because you don’t want to do raids or whatever content it comes from
---
&gt;Jormag can't take the wheel and control everyone with a hive mind like Mordremoth.
---
Yes he can. You forgot that he has magic from the dead Dragons now?
---
Except when it doesn't work and I have to move away from the flag and then back to it.
---
Ooooh gotcha.
---
So if I purchased a brand new copy of PoF today, which includes the core game and HoT, do I get all of the previous chapters of the LW with them or do I have to purchase them from the gem store?
---
Thank you for not even attempting to understand.
---
They announced this ahead of time, but I have a different theory.
---
Originally they were intended to be one episode, at the very start of development. It was then split when they changed their model of how the season is going to unfold and it seems rather weird because of the progress already made before that decision was just cut in half.
---
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that future episodes with that system already long in mind wont have that issue
---
Basically the story mission acts the same as the open world version of the Raven Sanctum, and by doing the story mission you also complete the open world version = you can go back into the Raven Sanctum in open world and get 4 chests of loot at the end of it without having to do all the choices you already did in the story mission. Then you can keep doing the raven Sanctum again daily in open world.
---
Exactly my point, there are options to get the function of legendary from pvp and wvw, but the “skin” of legendary armor from pve comes from the “endgame” of pve content and holds that prestige, in a game all about fashion wars that’s not a bad thing, you don’t have to have access to everything just because you want it. In most/all game modes there are unique items that show a level of dedication if not skill persay in that particular area. Anet has clearly shown that the transformation effect on raid armor is special as they didn’t add it to pvp or wvw stuff. If you want the shiny then do what it takes, don’t expect the be handed the shiny just because you don’t want to do raids or whatever content it comes from.
---
I also noticed they moved the BL Trading icon on the UI to where the PvP one used to be.  I guess that makes it easier to find now...definitely a QoL change for shareholders.
---
GV was a pretty good map.  It felt alive with a lot of different things to do.  The idea of different events going on counter-clockwise was something new and kept everyone mostly together.  It was predictable and the events were new.  The problem I had and still have with it though is that I have no urge to want to play it again which is something a lot of these new LS maps suffer from.  If the rewards and/or metas aren't interesting then people will move on pretty quickly to go back to whatever they were doing.  The problem there is that what people were doing before could be anything which includes them playing other games.  When people aren't playing GW2, they aren't spending money on it and that's not good for Anet.
---
And the fact that they didn't make one and instead focused on LS is......?
---
What the actual fuck? That is so strange and I'm glad she was safe though,  but also I have never heard of her before.
---
The brut of Mordremoth's magic went to Aurene. The bits that Balthazar stole ended up on Kralkatorrik, then to Aurene.
---
I'm not saying Jormag can't control minds, but it's likely not strong enough to control as many people as Mordremoth could with sylvari.
---
Thus 'everyone'.
---
Well the road from Grothmar goes through the Strike Mission so that's not an option
---
That is an increased per completion which means that was written for a more casual audience rather someone doing them every day.
---
just for this .... worst update ever  
---
be carefull  charrs, you'll be like your wintersday toy soon
---
Spaghetti code
---
&gt; Where are the unique, specific weapons that fit the theme of the release **like the Raven lens which is clearly a scepter**?
---
Afaik you unlock it by doing the Master of the Ancestral Forge collection, Tier 2. [Source](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raven%27s_Eye)
---
This collection also awards an unique helm.
---
What will make or break the saga will be how often releases are. If they are not every few weeks (2-4) instead of few months it will fail since there was less content than a normal living world episode, even though I thought the content was quite good.
---
When you roll just a centimeter too far and the pop up vanishes then you have to do the reverse of shame to get out of range to bring it up again. &gt;.&gt;
---
I'm sure it only works well at that ratio by chance in gw1.
---
No not really. Bounties have not any limit in players . Strikes must be done in ten so any ppl down counts. Moreover u cannot run from waypoint
---
And those players are very casual players who probably don't Raid or do Fractals, yes.
---
For those players this patch will keep them busy for weeks to come, and they probably still have half the story content with their respective maps to finish as well.
---
Well, neither does it perfectly.
---
GW1 does that weird thing with the character portraits. It just isn't as disruptive as cutting a character's head off.
---
Boneskinner will be one of the rotating strike missions, no?
---
Like they did the last five years?
---
Hmm why do you think they aren't working smart?
---
And the problem is that it just because easier for Anet to filter out all criticism, including that which is legitimate and grounded in real issues, if the majority of it is baseless nonsense like no earnable rewards, no communication, no content releases and similar.
---
There is so much that we can legitimately complain about and criticise - fractal release schedules, lack of alliances, no new sPvP map or modes, build templates, no new character select screen and so on - but here if you actually raise these issues in a reasonable manner, or point out when someone is simply frothing with false statements, you do run the risk of being downvoted or people going for personal attacks. It wasn't even this bad a month or so ago.
---
Ironically, recently I'm finding the official forums better for criticism I can't air in a few Twitter posts...
---
I think they are working on cost reduction / survival mode, therefore they have no room for good development.
---
There is a connection to other maps, but it isn't a portal.
---
The choppers in Black Citadel, Grothmar and Bjora Marches connect to each other.
---
Expand Dong every 2 weeks?
---
Raids is not liked by most of the community . It not my opinion but a fact . Forum is full of post trying to move more ppl in raiding but it won't happen for many reason .
---
They should add something obtainable with hard content which not require raid. Hope they will do sooner or later . If they skin were the same among game mode it would not be a rpoblem .
---
Link? What were they called? How were they interpreted as elite spec runes and not generic runes?
---
Raids and fractals were part of LW releases and they never announced them being cancelled, therefore expecting them is justified and reasonable.
---
The mere fact that you use the LFG tool for such game mode is laughable , downvote all you want it won't change a thing .
---
You have only yourself to blame , you're doing this to YOURSELF buddy - glhf .
---
'DoA' was too hard
---
He does say that the hunger is gone after consuming the boneskinner. It doesn't seem like corrupted flesh would make him feel better, but I can't imagine that all the other Kodans were able to acquire boneskinner flesh in their weakened state either.
---
I think you are right, and I also think it was partially in response to feedback here where people said that they didn't want a new map every chapter. (Though the funny thing is: it's the same overall number of maps if they split each release into two halves.)
---
Savage
---
Its hard to find new job when there's "ArenaNet" in your portfolio. Believe me.
---
Its not that it won't be expanded. It's that we got 1/2  of a normal episode sized map instead of 1/2 of a double sized map.
---
79 upvotes, wow.
---
You need to compare budgets, not the number of people.
---
It's the Blacklion Trading Companys retarded cousin
---
It will be added when the other chapter launches? If it was ready by now, why wouldn't they have included it in yesterday's chapter?
---
I really want to agree with you, but I can't bring myself to.
---
&gt;The story was good, creepy, and a new direction from the narrative team and I really liked it.
---
You can't tell me [](#s "Almorra's death") was a particularly moving or well-executed story beat. And hell, that was the *main takeaway* from the entire chapter. How else has the plot progressed? I agree that it sets a good tone and direction, but it hardly addresses anything about the prologue (Bangar, Ryland, Aurene, etc) and is far too short to have much substance at all.
---
Not to mention, the story missions were laughably easy and forgiving gameplay-wise. HoT, most of LS3, PoF, and most of LS4 at least put some effort into posing something of a challenge, but we've regressed back to personal-story-style enemies and encounters where if you have any semblance of a good build you'll mow your way through everything. 
---
&gt;The new map is full of dynamic events and hunts.
---
The light "puzzles" are just "follow the shiny and press F when it stops moving". The dynamic events are champion-tier squishy mobs, a boneskinner event chain where the boss himself dies in 20 seconds flat, and a boring time-gated meta where you spend most of the time fighting stuff that doesn't fight back. There are no adventures, races, or bounties.
---
&gt;The first Strike mission, while not raid-level, is much harder than the one from the Prologue.
---
Granted.
---
&gt;We've got a new upgrade-able weapons set
---
As is standard with any new living story episode release.
---
&gt;new mastery's
---
The raven locks mastery is given to you from the start, defeating the whole point of unlocking it to access previously inaccessible areas, so now we just end up with a map that has arbitrary barriers that we have to press F on. The raven lights mastery is for a single uninteresting achievement and nothing else. The essence mastery is extra faff that is never needed for anything beyond opening chests for measly rewards.
---
&gt;achievements
---
This episode has the fewest achievements of almost any living story episode to date. I finished a large majority of them in one sitting.
---
&gt;incredible ambient dialogue
---
Is there really that much of it? I didn't notice much at all.
---
&gt;3 new strike missions
---
Again, granted. Strike missions are fine for their intended purpose. They're almost irrelevant for anyone after any kind of challenge, but they're good for more casual players I guess.
---
&gt;Yes the story was a little short, but it was the first episode in the Saga, not an expansion.
---
Prologues tend to be much shorter than the chapters that come after them. They knocked it out of the park with the prologue and now released an episode that's a fraction of the size.
---
&gt;Yes, they didn't update WvW or PvP or add Fractals or a Raid wing, but they never said they were going to.
---
Except they have. [Various competitive features](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/85879/future-plans-competitive) have been stated to be in the works. [Raids and fractals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d1web4/full_english_translation_for_the_german_interview/) are stated to still be in development. Alliances for WvW especially have been in the works for years, and they've attempted to release fractals and raids on a somewhat regular cadence until now. Of course people will expect these things.
---
&gt;Stop crying and expecting all these things from an EPISODE of FREE CONTENT!
---
If people are promised "expansion-worthy content" and get something they view as lacklustre along with content they care about being bumped down more and more on the priority list, then they're going to express disdain. Of course, whining and cynicism is unproductive, but you definitely can't blame people for feeling disappointed.
---
we don't need it since we play the game only 2 hours on 3 months ..make it 1 hour less with this episode
---
A small nitpicky correction, it seems that this map will be expanded in Chap 3. Maybe chap 2 is another "half map" that will be expanded in chapter 4. Would make sense, considering each chapter is done by alternate teams.
---
Jesus Christ, thank you so much for this way to remember them. I couldn't for the life of me remember the system here, but "pokemon starters" sums it up perfectly. Thank you!
---
I hate when that happens. Congrats no less, it's a beautiful weapon.
---
It's definitely more challenging than the previous one. 
---
However I strongly feel that the mission should be on a daily rotation. Weekly there is no way you'll keep doing the same bosses over and over again.
---
Possible. Perhaps that's the smart thing to do, though.
---
ye he was like "wtf is this all?" and also deleted the game.
---
The good think is i saw this coming, i knew arenanet does not give a crap about the community, only about da dollar baby ! So i uninstalled months ago and started playing a real mmorpg, but i like to be right and as probably the most downvoted person on gw2 reddit, because people are defending their believes, i also respect that but i hate companies who do not care for their community, downvoting me is not making the content in gw2 better, if it did, gw2 would be next to wow. Anyway those who love gw2, i wish you better times....
---
And the bridge is collapsed, too.
---
Not really. You get a buff for 24 hours and progress on this AP.
---
Well, the game sells itself as a Buy-to-Play MMO. Free releases isn't an excuse to have bad releases, and if anything at all its counter productive because it makes people stop caring about the game which leads to less gem store sales. If you love the game you should not be giving them a pat on the back for this release. It will literally kill their game if they don't improve the content releases. Apathy is death for a game, not anger.
---
Nice way to think of it!
---
I loved it! One of my favorite releases from Anet tbh
---
No it'll be expanded in episode 2 as said in the Icebrood Saga announcement. This is episode 1 next is episode 2.
---
It's good in an organized, communicative environment and pretty terrible when people refuse to listen and do their own thing.  I've tried to do the public version of the Voice/Claw several times now and it ends really badly when people don't communicate, engage their lone-wolf auto-pilot skills and don't bring enough CC to trigger the double-burn.  
---
I've seen more than a couple people play at 1500-2000 range away, die in a corner and AFK.  With a commander you basically split into 2 sub-squads of (5) and (5) for each boss and DPS down to like 5-10% and kill them one by one.  It definitely isn't as simple as the 1st Strike Mission, and I'm happy about that, but w/o a tag it's pretty disorganized. 
---
I think if players can get into an organized Strike with proper communication and a commander it's fine.  Unfortunately, ArenaNet made the 1st strike mission ridiculously easy to curry favor and basically gave everyone a free pass.  I think their generosity is going to burn a lot of the casual players that thought it'd be some simple world bosses with easy loot.
---
I'm guessing this might just be the awkwardness of a gendered native language coming through, as the original poster does note that their (heh) game is not in English.
---
It's not that GW 'handled' your monitor better, but different design directions.
---
In GW1 the character is seen from further away in a 3D space, it's therefore easier to adapt. GW2 the camera is extremely closer to the character.
---
Didn’t even cross my mind...
---
On the other hand bikini clad anorexic fighting sex dolls aren't either. Potato potato I guess.
---
I see it and I don't find the reasoning to be compelling at all. 
---
It likely just worked differently because of the assets they used for the background, not because they had the amazing foresight to future proof against some really absurd stretched out aspect ratios. 
---
There's no reason to suspect that it was deliberately anticipated other than some desire for a bit of "back in the day things were better" nostalgia.
---
Very similar specs although a 1070 and its fine for me :s
---
&gt; And how this doesn't translate in "different design directions"? 
---
Because 1 is a perfect implementation while the other is an imperfect implementation. There's no reason whatsoever to implement it the way it is in GW2 when there is a working solution in GW, other than whoever chose the implementation didn't care. 
---
&gt; Both GW1 and GW2 are handled differently, presented differently and offer different features. So they're bound to behave differently. 
---
This is one area where there is no reason for it to behave differently. Why even defend this? I don't get it.
---
&gt;Has nothing to do with "care".
---
It has *everything* to do with care. They just couldn't be assed to look at how GW handled it, or they couldn't be bothered to invest the time into it.
---
The background has nothing to do with this. It's about how they implemented the scaling of the character model. It's the first thing you see when you log in... it doesn't look very good for ArenaNet if it looks like shit, especially when it worked great in GW.
---
&gt;Fractals are replayed dozens of times... deliver endless content
---
Once and for all: repeating same base fractals thousands of times until all moves/lines are known by heart, and only uptuning health numbers for difficulty - is not content. It's development laziness.
---
There is a third party plugin that translate the DX9 calls to DX12 and can give you 10-15 extra frames on some maps like Lion's Arch.
---
GW2 is basically the same engine used on GW1 back on 2004.
---
No stop defending this, with your kind of obedient customer we have this crappy evolution of the game.
---
I can totally agree that there were more players farming world events than dungeons.
---
But why are we doing solo story missions now? Most likely they saw players were logging in for living world. 
---
That doesn't mean people like story missions. It just means people like new releases.
---
I think they were said to have over 300 employees left after the layoffs. Those were in  February right? How a team of over 300 people can deliver such a small amount of content is beyond me. And then there's not even an expansion in the works that could justify this. Even worse, they admitted that they didn't even want to do another expac and instead replace it with THIS. 
---
I cannot fathom how blind or stupid you have to be to practise such a business model but in any other economic sector you would have been fired long ago and replaced with someone who actually DOES WORK. Guess I'll go back and play something else after finishing the achievs and will be coming back to the next drops of content in January or probably February...
---
If there’s ever an unpopular opinion that has been expressed, this actually is one lol.
---
How do you get back in there??
---
This isn't new information. It's already widely known that the game isn't very well optimized, and it's not just a matter of PC specs - the engine itself sometimes struggles to carry the load it's given. But we manage.
---
why? because its a thred I opened? :D
---
What is the better ranged weapon for condi mirage, staff or scepter? I tried the axe in both slots setup from metabattle, but not having an option to fall back felt a bit awkward, especially when still learning tha class.
---
Thank for your reply!
---
&gt;I suspect that they never 'intended' for crucible to 'proc' herb node rewards
---
If that was the case, I'd expect something in the patch notes.
---
Now it's worse to harvest with crucible than without any glyph at all, since I should have atleast gotten varietal cilantro seeds.
---
Also added a bug report link to my post, in case you want to confirm it there too.
---
And as usual with you twats the point flies right over your head because you're too inept to see the bigger picture. Useless fucking trash. 
---
"Everything is okay because I say it's okay and my own subjective experience says so!"
---
You idiots and your reductionist logic. People doing content doesn't mean the game isn't dying. The game is still hemorrhaging players, support, and money. If this continues in the trend that it currently is, the game ***will*** die. Therefore, the game ***is*** dying. Regardless of your pathetic attempts at saying it isn't, the reality of the situation is much different from the one that you've substituted in order to feel better about yourself.
---
Thank goodness for the path of exile resurgence.
---
Works in Canada too. Got mine.
---
As much as I hate to agree with something written so sarcastically, quite a lot of us are done with all of the above already with exception to the next two rotations of the Strike Mission because they haven't been made playable yet.
---
I think ArenaNet ultimately fails at raids/strike by not explaining mechanics *at all*. How hard is it to add an NPC that shouts vague suggestions of what to do? We have that for world bosses already.  
---
The whole trial and error is a major waste of time. It took us 2 tried to get the Voice &amp; Claw kill. The first time we focused only one, then the other one wiped us with full enraged stacks. Try 2 we figured out we had to kill them at the same time which is fine, except that after we killed them, most of us couldn't even loot the chests. This was the biggest middle finger to us for the 20min we wasted fighting in total. Locking the Strike mission chests behind masteries this time around was a scumbag move. At least give us prior warning so we don't waste our time.  
---
Then there's the invisible ground effects bug which seems to occur for me very frequently. During the phase where they go in the middle and cover the ground in AoE, the ground effect is invisible and kills me more often than not. During the enraged phase, the ground effect also becomes invisible often.
---
I mean, dagger already has a ranged cripple and a leap. It doesn't really offer anything that dagger doesn't, except for a second evade if dagger 4 isn't enough.
---
Yup. It frustrates me but that's what I think has been going on with this sub recently. People who want to give meaningful criticism have been burnt out. Meaningfully criticism takes a lot of thought and effort in your response and either way it gets shit on depending on whether the sub is favoring "ded gaem" mentality or wants to worship Anet at the time you post. 
---
That's not to say I haven't seen people try. There were some good breakdowns on the issue with build templates, for example. The problem I saw with some of those was the comments rarely added anything but mindless cynicism and rage.
---
What do you mean? NCSoft came to the rescue and put a stop to these side projects.
---
&gt; objectively 
---
You mean subjective. I'm sure you were using hyperbole to express your point, but it is an opinion. While I'm speculating as to why they made the change, it probably was for visual clarity, especially on higher DPI screens where the icon would become muddled (hence the extra white-space). Either way I like previous design better.
---
are you releasing the rest soon?
---
Or it shows that GW2 is an old game now and that weird aspect ratios werent a thing when the game came out.
---
&gt;  The wider the monitor, the wider the character needs to render, therefore the taller the monitor needs to be. 
---
I checked this and I completely did not expect it to be true! I play windowed, so I resized the gane window to a square-ish proportions, and finally my charr character fit completely onto the screen, hat and all, and with room to spare!
---
https://i.imgur.com/jCdtD7s.jpg
---
100% of that is an assumption on your part with really nothing backing it up.  
---
You really have absolutely no idea if it's related to the width of the monitor or a display characteristic of any other asset on that screen.  Cascading effects happen, and sometimes they look like they're caused by something else. What you think is GW "clearly" watching out for the height of the monitor can **very easily**, at least as likely as not, be a case of GW just working with a different set of variables that happened not to conflict.
---
If I try to squeee though a narrow doorway carrying a chair and I make it fine but I get stuck later carrying a table, it doesn't mean that I took the small size of the doorway into better consideration more the first time.  It just means that despite the doorway not changing, the set of variables I was working with changed to impact it.          The fact that an error suddenly presents doesn't mean that it wasn't there before.   
---
Unless you can show me the code directly using the implementation that you *think* both games are using you've got nothing but your own biases driving this assumption.
---
Na, bro, don't you realize the major mobike developer parent company came in to save them from the folly of mobiles?
---
I’m so desensitized to character deaths in this game. I picked the vigil and there has been no nod to that or anything. Incredibly disappointing for what should have been an impactful death to me.
---
It's fun for fluid combat in open world, especially with the minor rework it received, and can flow pretty smoothly with Soulbeast Dagger in either hand
---
I liked the story too. What I dont like is how short it was. I don't think theres any excuse for releasing such a small amount of content when theyve done much more in the past for free as well.
---
I don't know why this is so surprising, of all the dragons if you really think about it, Jormag is the one that actually interacts most with people even from the Norn intro itself, having a personal beef with the Norn, or maybe the Norn made it personal; regardless, there were more exposure there. If anything, Jormag was the first to be displayed like that given Svanir, and definitely not Mordremoth. 
---
Meanwhile, Primordius, Kralkatorrik and the others seem more forces of nature in their approach, not seeming to have that much agendas with whatever they were destroying at the time, to attain their higher goal. Or at least, Kralk did seem it until the end and we learn a bit more.
---
I suppose you could also include the nordic theme, with the Norn, where tricksters and being fooled is the favourite antagonists or dooms, be it in the Norse myths or even the finnish Kalevala. Trickster-Jormag kind of fits in that way as well. I have no idea if they're influenced by that though, it's just kind of fitting.
---
I would still recommend playing it. Even if you get mad later that it was so short, it was an interesting bit of content. The story has great spooky vibes and the map is equally awesome. Yes, lots of people are disappointed in how short it was (as am I) but it doesn't detract from how cool of a detour this was from the norn. No sassy comments from the commander, no poorly timed jokes, and no comedy on the verge of death. Just an actually well done bit of story with a nice, creepy vibe.
---
Then why does the 14 year old game handle it perfectly? I don't understand your logic at all.
---
I dont like it either. Hopefully they’ll add one later on
---
&gt;Because 1 is a perfect implementation while the other is an imperfect implementation. There's no reason whatsoever to implement it the way it is in GW2 when there is a working solution in GW, other than whoever chose the implementation didn't care.
---
Neither one is a "perfect" implementation.  Both of them present problems. Both of them have odd behaviors under abnormal criteria.   That the problem presenting in GW2 sticks in your particular craw doesn't make it magically more egregious.
---
yea sure, gear wise it's the [average](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/) build. Traits are almost the same too, just select the upper first trait in radiance (perma fury), the down first trait in zeal (25 might) and the first mid and first second trait in firebrand (quickness)
---
&gt; They feel more like filler masteries than anything.
---
To be fair, this has been a problem since masteries were introduced in HoT.
---
30+ is not "fine" 
---
60 should be the bare  minimum in [current year]
---
I think an hour is generous....I feel like it took me 45 mins at the most.
---
Yes in modern games this is 7 years old and built on an engine that’s 15 years old
---
I liked the old one better : /
---
"I did some math therefore I am right."
---
It doesn't change the fact that money and time have been spent on the game and it's all going to go down the drain when they stop service for the game. I can still go and watch that movie by buying the DVD or access to it on a streaming website. When GW2 is shut down, it's gone for good. The fact that you conflate buying a movie with a game being shut down is indicative of your low intelligence. Doing some quick and shitty math doesn't prove your point in the slightest, you subhuman cunt.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/groups/blizzard-tracker/activity/posts
---
That's the example I was thinking of.
---
Jesus Christ just look at the bottom half of the screen.  It looks like complete garbage under that resolution, like, some old PS1 trying to make 3d without the resources wonky.  It just doesn't bother *you* as much so you call it "perfect."
---
what a waste of resources
---
I'm just really curious as to why?
---
The chests are per character and per day, and you need to do the trials (or in other words, have the trials buff) to loot them all, if you don't have the buff from story then the trials will trigger in the open world once you enter the respective chambers. You can't enter via the door with a character that hasn't finished the story, but you can TP to friend in. Don't know if a portal is possible.
---
Haha yes, Guild Wars 2 bad!
---
&gt;In the early 2000s, people were making the switch from 4:3 monitors to 16:9. Good game developers designed/modified their games so that no matter what resolution you were running, the game would display properly. 
---
During this period developers were *also* actively refusing to support wide resolutions because of the advantage they gave. They intentionally displayed *improperly*. It's easy to look back and remember the good shit but there was plenty of bad.
---
&gt; Yet it has nothing to do with "caring" or ill intents. 
---
Then why is it different when the first implementation is perfect?
---
&gt; Sure, let's ignore the two times I've said this is a design flaw. A programmer with selective reading, amazing ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
You have not once said it was a design flaw. You said twice that is was a "different design direction".
---
&gt; No, I chose 3 but added I don't like/agree when people assume it's a lack of care/love or ill intents. If anything, GW1 is compatible by coincidence and GW2 isn't because of a *simple oversight*. Should they update it? Yeah. Should it be a priority? Not my responsibility to tell but *personally* I would say no, it shouldn't. 
---
I'm not asking them to fix it...? As my title clearly states, this sums up the lack of care that ArenaNet have for GW2 compared to GW. I don't give a shit if it's fixed or not. I don't play for more than a few days per year.
---
&gt; Then why do you play? 
---
Do you see where it says I have a total of 2452 achievement points? The character on screen was created the day GW2 came out. I clearly do not play lol.
---
Oh it's per character? I have only tried on one character so far. Thanks for letting me know
---
Wow, you've got a great finger on the pulse of the community there, pretending like your pithy outrage is somehow the minority when most people are fawning over tiny QoL improvements.
---
Whatever gets you clicks I guess
---
It just goes to show how good ArenaNet were back then! They didn't have to implement it the way they did, but it shows that they took pride in their product.
---
As a warning, don't go there with your inventory full. You will be not able to claim the loot, but can't even open your inv to make space either as the game will not allow you. ("Your inventory has been disabled in this instance")
---
Yeah, I discovered the chests too and was wondering if it's a potential place to park characters so I tested it out with one without the story completion.
---
Man that is a tiny map
---
True
---
D-did you just go against ANet? May the merciful Six watch over you.
---
True. The decline of fractal and raid community is a direct consequence of what (and when) they produced for the respective mode. After glorious stuff like Nightmare and SO, quality significantly declined; raid releases take just too long and the more recent ones aren't that good either.
---
Anyway, in some way I'm even happy about the statement. At least it's very clear now that raid and fractal players cannot expect anything from ANet in the foreseeable future. Makes it easier for me to switch to other games and just log in to unlock the episodes.
---
They got about 300 people. Three content teams for PvE, one for PvP+WvW. That's 294 people left. 200 are baking and eating cake, the rest of them is creating cash shop items.
---
As I said, that's actually expected behaviour based on my FOV. That's exactly how GW2 would render it too if it had the portraits displayed in the same way. Changing the FOV would "fix" that.
---
It gives a whole another spin to the Spirits of the Wild. IIRC, they were the ones that guided the Norn south to Hoelbrak. But if it was Jormag that suggested it through Asgeir, then why did the Spirits guide the Norn? Why did the Spirits fight Jormag when they all wanted the same thing? Were they deceived by Jormag's schemes (maybe Jormag and Asgeir faked a battle to get the Spirits to cooperate)? Or maybe... The spirits themselves are Jormag's minions?
---
&gt;  very small now.
---
I hate to tell you but that community has always been small. GW2 at its core is not about 10 man instanced content. Its great to have but the majority of the game didn't play GW2 expecting/wanting to have something like that.
---
I am assuming on a character that has finished the story?
---
I know.. But I thought it's better than nothing :O
---
Thank you for sharing this
---
What you're describing demonstrates a linked behavior, not a cause.  This is correlation != causation, basic logic stuff.  I'm not sure why you have such a problem with it.
---
Also I'm sorry but your credentials mean next to nothing in the context of this conversation. Medical professionals with degrees push antivax and naturopath BS.  People with finance degrees regularly grind themselves into soul crushing debt because they fail to put theory into practice.  Having a degree and being qualified on paper doesn't make you an instant expert who can divine the functioning of code you don't even have access to.  Making that appeal to authority really just demonstrates that you're not willing to approach this from a clear perspective.
---
There's a helicopter
---
Did this as well, ty!
---
Lol so much this.
---
Here I have been called *trash* (and less nice things) because i run healbrand in cm fractals. The gw2 pros become rabid at the thought... 
---
Btw people really like me in game, i actually have 3 different raid groups i need to juggle because i can't play that much, and trust me i'm not super good at the game, yet this people keep inviting me!!!
---
But here? Here i'm a fucking leech, pure garbage, all thats wrong with the game... And then it hit me... They get mad because a "noskill" person does the exact same content as they do. Because they can't cut it in  a harder game.
---
&gt; You have not once said it was a design flaw. You said twice that is was a "different design direction".
---
[Lol, sure ↓](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dz5w92/it_may_seem_small_but_this_perfectly_sums_up_the/f85kitc/) 
---
&gt; GW2 is flawed in many fields **and this is one of them.**
---
Moving on: 
---
&gt;I'm not asking them to fix it...? As my title clearly states, this sums up the lack of care that ArenaNet have for GW2 compared to GW. I don't give a shit if it's fixed or not. I don't play for more than a few days per year.
---
&gt; I clearly do not play lol.
---
So let me sum it up. You're not even an active player, you hardly play, you're not asking for a fix. You just posted to stir up drama and do digs at Anet?
---
Really mature. Carry on then. I'm sure your thread will last long.
---
what kind of content do you play
---
No, it's exactly the point. You gave the games abnormal, extremely uncommon parameters and both of them are acting irregularly because of it, yet you called one of them "perfect" because you can't be arsed to accept that there are multiple possible explanations for a problem besides the one that lets you feel the most righteously indignant.
---
This living world is as vital as a 95yr-old granny kept alive by machines
---
&gt; You gave the games abnormal, extremely uncommon parameters and both of them are acting irregularly because of it 
---
Lol what?
---
The whole post is about the character. GW could have the portraits completely invisible and my point would still be valid. The portraits are an entirely separate discussion. 
---
&gt; both of them are acting irregularly because of it 
---
GW's portraits also aren't acting irregularly lol. They're rendering in an H+ fashion based on the FOV. This is actually the standard implementation in most games that support 32:9. I doubt you will accept that though lol.
---
People complain about the launcher not being updated.
---
Launcher gets updated.
---
People complain that people like that the launcher is updated.
---
Also, that's literally the first thing you see, and was therefore the first thing posted, giving it more time to get likes than gameplay posts, which...ya know....people had to get through the story first to post about. 
---
I swear some of ya can find a complaint about literally everything lmao
---
Yep. Content droughts wouldn't be so bad if there were more stories to actually explore.
---
map is not a content? You say that in open world focused game? WOW , nice bait there friend, not falling for that
---
didn't the story missions related to Dry top/Silverwaste came out at 2week intervals to make up for the shorter story and locking of parts of the map?
---
Next patch is probably in february so that is a giant difference.
---
Yeah it's good fun. I find the GW2 Reaper to be the most fun (or should I say "Least un-fun") profession to play purely because the minion master build reminds me a lot of GW Necro MM.
---
&gt; Fair enough. Did you change that in the edit? edited 36 minutes ago.
---
Posted 40 minutes ago, edited 4 minutes later for some grammar error. The flaw statement has been there since the beginning. 
---
&gt; Since when is pointing out a flaw immature? You don't know how hypocritical you are...
---
Pointing a flaw by itself isn't immature, but the intent behind it is. 
---
Gw2 isn't a game you play, this flaw hardly ever affect you *yearly* yet you created this thread with the sole purpose to do a dig at Anet and accuse them of "not caring" with baseless assumptions. That's miles away from posting in hope of a fix because it affects you daily.
---
You act like this resolution matters to you when it's a game you've said yourself play at most a few days per years. That's what is hypocritical.
---
Don't mind the aspect change. What I hate is that they moved it at the end of the button row
---
I get the frustration, but stating this was the original plan is plain baseless. They never said LS4 would be followed by an expac, we just assumed that.
---
pls dont remove post this time k thx
---
Except it isnt. Its content behind an expansion.
---
You have your own personal Story about sleepy hollow i guess haha
---
Are there any specializations that are similar to weaver where you're chaining together a bunch of different skills, but maybe not as complicated and also naturally a bit more durable? As I'll be playing solo or without support builds often
---
I find Guardian and Warrior to be too simple despite what combos they have because you just mash things as soon as they come off cooldown, and Revenant (esp Renegade) is fun but doesn't feel very effective... and also boils down into mashing skills off cooldown but also F1
---
Spoiler because it reveals the character:
---
&gt;! Almorra Soulkeeper is the founder and leader of the Vigil, one of the major orders of Tyria (as the Lv30 personal story). She even had a metal song for her in the Metal Legion event! !&lt;
---
You're just yet another person fantasizing about conspiracies and infecting the fandom with paranoia, just like everything else. You're not clever and you don't know better, you just want to feel special with your stupid theories.
---
They can't compete in esports so they come here to harass normal players which wants to have some fun and gaming is not their job
---
I know a lot of people stopped caring with the announcement. They kind of just threw it all away with more living story and no elite specs.
---
Nope! Something happened about a year and a half ago that drove away a lot of the nice people in the community and it's been a toxic cesspool ever since.
---
tbh the only thing that's going to make me play again regularly is new elite specs, or the return of skill-capping.
---
thanks, i was about to comment that too...i wish we had they in singular in polish :/
---
it still doesn't make sense, we can all get a quick and fast map completion now. When the map expands i guess map completion would requiere the entire thing.
---
play the fight, figure it out, if you dont know what your doing, smash your head against it until you do.
---
I suspect a text tutorial that's accessible when you reach the strike mission (kinda like how they alert players to new stuff when they level up), that explains new mechanics introduced in that mission, would help a lot. Vets saying "cc" in chat is cool, but not everyone knows what that means and wouldn't necessarily think to find out before the fight. And if this is someone's first MMO, they may not understand the importance of stacking, or other things.
---
A lot of people have guilds or friends who can teach them this stuff, which is good, but a lot probably need a tutorial to help them out.
---
&gt; Posted 40 minutes ago, edited 4 minutes later for some grammar error. The flaw statement has been there since the beginning. 
---
Fair enough. I clearly missed that I didn't realise you'd changed your stance from the 2 previous comments.
---
&gt;Pointing a flaw by itself isn't immature, but the intent behind it is.
---
The intent is to discuss a flaw that has been there since I assume the initial implementation and has not been fixed. We're discussing the GW character screen on the front page of r/GuildWars2 right now. Here's the link if you missed it:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dytruj/first\_of\_all\_thank\_you\_very\_much\_for\_the\_new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dytruj/first_of_all_thank_you_very_much_for_the_new/) 
---
It's a relevant and natural development of the topic. The title is my professional opinion of the situation. As a GW2 hardcore player, I would be a lot more annoyed than I currently am...
---
&gt;Gw2 isn't a game you play, this flaw hardly ever affect you *yearly* yet you created this thread with the sole purpose to do a dig at Anet and accuse them of "not caring" with baseless assumptions. That's miles away from posting in hope of a fix because it affects you daily. 
---
It's just an observation. Am I not allowed to point out flaws? Especially in my field?
---
&gt; You act like this resolution matters to you when it's a game you've said yourself play at most a few days per years. That's what is hypocritical.
---
ArenaNet's attitude is what matters to me, and this is a symptom of it. If you haven't got that yet, I really don't know what to tell you.
---
So, to sum it all up so that you finally understand:
---
1. It's my professional opinion that ArenaNet don't care about this game like they did with their first game
---
2. Their attitude annoys me as a long time fan because the game has been a continuing disappointment for me personally.
---
3. I posted this today because it's relevant.
---
Hmm, seems like they're studying Zoology.

[I casually opened this spoiler tag because I care about almost none of the main characters and it ends up being my favorite one for the past 7+ years.](https://imgur.com/gallery/qJmO4VO)
---
Not that I've seen. I'm still stuck with the same problem. Doing the Story on another Character will let you go through, but the first character will be bugged still. So if you want to finish the Episode, try doing it on an alt. :(
---
There are lots of new assets and new tech in the release - it just doesnt translate well in terms of "amount of content".
---
(With new tech I mean: tier rewards in collections, enemies use food buffs, enemies move on mounts, dismount on engage, the stuff belonging to the masteries, some stuff belonging ot the rotating sms, rotating LS dailies, possibly some tech that allows for the map to expand in subsequent releases [yes we've had this before, but lots has changed since then]).
---
I guess an optimist might hope that now, that all this is out of the way the next releases might have more content, but then again… they would have known that this release was on the smaller side, so why didnt they push it?...
---
you just like drama more then.
---
why would they have been done with the second episode month ago? Its not like they produce a bunch of episodes at once until polish and then leave them laying around.
---
cm fractal would be ok.
---
the whole point of raid, to me is that it's content which takes the whole evening, so it's not comparable with my playing time. that's all.
---
having fractal split in 3 was a game changer to me
---
"Side note, everyone knows the best skins are just hiding behind a credit card in the gemstore."
---
no, not really
---
this map is not finished yet.
---
You realise the image does not show active developers? We have no idea if Blizzard's definition of developers matches Arenanet's (as it is NOT a specific term by any means). 
---
The 2012 numbers list team members, NOT active developers.
---
The 2014 numbers are based off the assumption that every person on the credits was a full-time employee, which is false, so any count of "active developers" based on that number is unreliable.
---
The one point where both teams refer to active devs is in 2016, and again, we don't know if they're using the same definition.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
As a final point, shall we actually look at the "proven" underperformance of GW2 releases:
---
Between 2016-2017 WoW released: 1 expansion and 6 content patches including 4? new zones, 3 raids, 3 dungeons and 3 pieces of story.
---
Between 2016-2017 GW2 released: 1 expansion and 7 content patches (excluding festivals) including 7 new maps, 4 raids, 4 fractals and 7 pieces of story.
---
Cute lion &gt; old lion
---
As someone that primarily uses gender neutral pronouns, it's appreciated!
---
The position was also changed, it used to be to the right of the mail icon and now it's the right-most icon.
---
I do miss GW1. Afaik there's never been a real spiritual successor.
---
At least here's something is happening, unlike in the game.
---
Why is no one complaining about Alienware bring a dead company and this being a bad promo? Where is the salt?!
---
Unfortunately this promo has a small key allotment it seems.
---
Have you noticed this reddit yesterday and today?   
---
Blizz can use their devs to an extend  
---
Anet can buy them waffles.
---
Gaile Gray was a Community Manager and a poor one but since she left they don't seem to have replaced her.
---
I really liked it too! It was creepy, I know I am very weak-hearted so I was jumping at those random sounds, the meta is really cool with the chains (I wonder what happens if we fail it), the story left me wanting for more. Strike mission is really nice too, felt some pressure doing it with random groups. VA this episode was solid too, from smaller NPCs to Raven's voice etc. I will certainly be hanging out there for a while, hunting for achievements :)
---
You can eat out of a trashcan for free. That doesn't mean it's good or worth my time to spend on.
---
Nope but poor development and communication has a tendency to turn a community this way.
---
The skyscale was far from a grind.    
---
It was timegated, sure. But not a grind.
---
That something is EAnet.
---
I sat there and listened. Very nice bit of lore to listen to :)
---
I got 10/25!
---
1. "Thanks Anet"
---
2. Hates humans
---
3. Loves charr
---
4. Loves living world
---
5. Hates pvp
---
6. Bad at fashion wars
---
7. Never played gw1
---
8. "Imagine crying over free content"
---
9. Thinks the story is really good
---
10. "If you don't like it, just leave"
---
The rest:
---
1. Only plays one build - No, I now have two builds per character
---
2. "Raids are toxic" - 90% of time they are not
---
3. Cried when Trahearne died - Glad he died, was annoying
---
4. Only presses 1 - Only in open world events
---
5. Downvotes you - Never upvoted or downvoted, ever
---
6. Catmander - Don't have tags
---
7. Pays for build templates - No, waiting for account-wideness first
---
8. Buys gems - Never with real money
---
9. Thinks fractals are too hard - No, I mostly play T1
---
10. Has all the mount skins - Got none
---
11. Hates raids, never played them - I love raids and clear then mostly on Mondays
---
12. "WvW?" - WvW is super fun
---
13. Loves Taimi - Her voice gives me migraine
---
14. Never played a dungeon - Completed them million times
---
15. Rare and masterwork gear - No, all my characters are full ascended
---
I'll believe that "expansion worth of content" when I see a LS map with a Meta event, and new elite specialisations.
---
How did you get so many?
---
I only got around 2-300 yesterday and today combined, while harvesting the nodes around the map, killing most champs and doing the meta
---
People won't learn after so many years. I can't come up with anything short of putting a huge fucking wall in front of them with a note 'If you won't cc and deal damage you won't be able to clear this instance, which is btw solo only.'
---
But that's not going to happen. Primarly because people here think that, for some reason, since they are adults with work and shit (I'm working as well and somehow I am not shit, so idk, maybe I am the second coming of Jesus, perfoming miracles?), so that they don't want to spend time learning how to do something they do as a hobby and for fun. 
---
Which is kind of strange, because the things you call hobbies, you're doing those out of passion, so it's only logical that you would want to be the best you can be. 
---
But some people decided to treat playing a game the same as watching a game.
---
Because that was SO FUN and appreciated back with Dry Top... :P
---
What troubles? The layoffs? The GW2 team was meant to be a similar size as before and its at the point where they can't be used as an excuse.
---
Uhm… rollerbeetle was the third episode while skyscale was literally the last episode of last season. 
---
And while its probably true that the largest part of people who play the game are mainly doing open world stuff, stating that noone cares about fractals and raids, when these are the main engame modes for PvE is a bit...
---
Also sometimes when I reset a race (teleporting back onto the flag), it doesn't work.
---
Truly nothing is sacred to Jormag
---
According to rumors Icebrood Saga was originally meant to be an expansion. One of the GW2 streamers was told by a designer like 2 years ago that a Shiverpeaks expansion was in the works, but they changed it into a "Saga" when they announced it in Summer 2018 that we will go straight from Season 4 into Season 5. 3rd expansion might very well be in the works, but I can't really predict anything that I would be confident in. ANET hasn't really proved to ever have had really "long term" plans, usually stuff was planned only like 2-3 years in advance which isn't long term.
---
Yea, because loads of games release content with an in-game walkthrough.
---
Oh my god he's so CUTE
---
I wish you could give that look to the necro flesh golem.
---
How hard is it compared to Mursaat Overseer? (Keep in mind that's not a very high bar either...)
---
I came to gw2 because my genji is utter trash and i can't go past diamond, i know how it is (i'm not a toxic ass to others though)
---
The final cutscene? Not only it was pre-rendered but our character was once again invisible (or at the back of the room watching from afar his friends interacting with Jormag).
---
I thought the increase in quality for storytelling would fix that :(
---
I'm sorry Jim, Tracy, and Jennifer hurt you. It's been twenty years since the accident. It's time to let go.
---
Zoom functions like in gw1 would be a welcome addition to the character screen
---
It was nice story, very short though.
---
The map has many events to do, but it gets repetitive after a while. Meta event is nice. It has long chain of events.
---
Best of all, I got the unique ascended hammer drop from it, which just made my night. So much fun.
---
lol,pvp and wvw have no content teams, pve have 4 overlaping teams,or so they said.
---
probably not if youre doing it just for loot, think the best stuff you get out of it goes towards making the weapon track but idk for sure.
---
because it isn't restricted to a single country and company that is dead / dying / obscure / badly managed / broken. the small amount of keys is pretty stupid though.
---
That's pretty lame. Thanks for the advice though. I'll do that. :)
---
Do you have to have the new essence system unlocked to do the Strike?
---
These are reasons to watch a movie not play a game.
---
&gt; Keep having groups wipe because asking them to stack
---
In this context what is "stack" refering to? Stack players in the same place to gain buffs?
---
You missed the Bjora Marches loading screen shaman, and it's the best one of them all too.
---
Thanks for your work! What's the requirement for being able to open those chests exactly? Do you just need the Tier 2 mastery, or do you also need some stacks of the buffs?
---
You looked at my small comment and made everything i thought into words. Are you a mindreader ?
---
&gt; I think most raiders dont realize that their community is what kills Raiding.
---
What kills raiding is ArenaNet simply not giving a shit.
---
The entire history of GW2 is them just abandoning game modes constantly, and introducing new ones to generate buzz. Remember Stronghold. Remember Guild Halls. Remember dungeons. 
---
The only reason raids still exist is because of the sheer passion of its playerbase. Which is a testament of how important and player-driven they are. 
---
ArenaNet just doesn't give a shit.
---
backtracking like this is pure cancer and used as excuse to name it "content"
---
it's not you, when the story is unusually short, has a ton of reused assets, is strangely basic (come on how many times can we just walk around and click on things a couple times as an entire mission) and nothing is remotely fleshed out or given impact. 
---
the tone is cool but I feel fine saying this is the laziest worst LS anet has ever made, which is heartbreaking since this was a test of their new "refocus".
---
all in all 4/10 episode.
---
The gw1 login screen was fantastic. Being able to zoom out as well as rotate be great. Camera rotation instead of the current character rotation gives a greater sense of immersion I believe as you experience your character grounded in the game world and not in some nebulous mists
---
It completely trivializes Raptor and Jackal though
---
Honestly I'm not trying to be a jerk but how is THIS the result of all those talented people working for months at a time, a huge amount of the entire episode is reused mechanics and assets. 
---
This is their "refocus"? If this is the amount of content they can put out now no wonder we can't get an expansion, it would take them 50 years to make. 
---
Can we get a refocus for the refocus??
---
Looks like the way Charr were presented before GW2 and after GW2.
---
Ppl like you is why the game is like this lol
---
I almost always have GW2 on background when logging in here on Reddit. GW2 is a super fun game. Reddit can be fun too. Reddit is really good place to get things off chest anonymously, expressing concerns, praising new content and eating popcorn when there is drama.
---
I've long wanted consistency from ArenaNet but not to the point of being formulaic.
---
Though even that's arguable since we're getting even less focus on content now except for maybe more resources being spent on story. More focus on story without substantial gameplay to back it up is not good in my book.
---
People playing the game because they enjoy it? Haha what a bunch of white knights!
---
An experienced group can clear 1-7 in 3-4 hours, a single wing takes 45-60 minutes average, I do training groups that clear certain wings in about 1.5-2 hours brand new to the wing, raid certainly don’t take the whole evening if you don’t want them to, if that’s your main I don’t like raids argument it’s based on a bad assumption and IS NOT a reason to hand out raid rewards outside of raids.
---
As said by others before the awsome devs that were into pvp and made the great combat system all left slightly before or shortly after release of gw2.
---
What content do you play? Builds vary across content. 
---
Check out metabattle for the current meta builds for each content type.
---
Isn't the map supposed to "dynamically expand" or something like that with the next episodic release? I'm hoping they add a portal to Grothmar Valley with that "expansion" as well as presumably to the west, where it seems we will be going next.
---
South of the vista, and a little higher
---
There is no way to convert anyone who doesn't even know the term "cc" or what they need to due in order to delete a blue bar under the red one to an aspiring raider. None. And there is no way you get to level 80 AND partake in this kind of content without coming across breakbars and that pesky cc term before - a few here and there will, but not the broad mass, which seems always to be the case.
---
People who don't teach themselves these very basics by looking them up on the internet have no place in raids at all, simply because they aren't willing to improve. Thats not to say that ArenaNet should not include information like this ingame, they absolutely should. But it won't change the mind- and skillset of the majority.
---
The pure bliss to steal an enemys minion armee with your necro.
---
Yeah I miss lots of stuff from gw. I always wonder why they so often picked worse options design wise.
---
The longer I Play, the more I enjoy it! Which is Kind of weird considering the short Story. 
---
The Story is really short, which was a stupid decision imO, and there are other very valid criticisms, but the small, positive changes start to add up after a while. 
---
The new Dailies System, a harder grind for masteries, the actual tutorial they managed for them, cool new bosses and Events, lots and lots of athmosphere…
---
Don't bother. 
---
CD reaper was a thing before scourge, before horror nerf and deathly chill nerf. It relies heavily on bleeding(which is weakest of damaging conditions) and spinning in your ice field for chill&gt;bleeding. If any other fields override your ice field which is 99% of time, your DPS will be diminished. 
---
Besides it's less efficient on epi burst or other conditions, it has no condi/expertise modifier traits, clumsy at conditions transfer and can't convert condis. 
---
Honestly if you want to play condi, go scourge. Although scourge is excruciating to play after last patch's fuckover, it's way better than condi reaper.
---
Why don't you try a different game?
---
I personally almost stopped interacting on subreddit and so did vast majority of people I know, thanks to doomsayers like /u/Zosin in every single thread, or straight trolls like /u/borismeateater that we just stopped feeding until they once again make new account. Not gonna mention more to get once again votebrigaded when I called out few people from the "community". Discord discussions are enough for me, no need to lose sanity by attempting trying to have constructive exchange on this sub in last few months.
---
But yeah, it's mostly sign of part of the community dropping the subreddit - which is not possible to translate to actual game population trends nowadays, as people tend to stick to sub even if they don't play to tell others how they uninstalled the game year ago and that everyone here is worthless because we have fun playing the game.
---
I don't know what the conditions are and if it affects the loot, but the large chest in that room can have different names. So far I've seen it called Rewards of Morning, Dawn, Daybreak and Midday, sometimes at the same time (I see one name, my guildie sees another one).
---
Wohoo got one! Redeems-in game right?
---
lordkrall is just salty because he is notorious for shilling ANet at every opportunity.
---
Well that's one way to prove the raiding community is a toxic cesspit.
---
Right.
---
Elaborate :)
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure it wouldn't work as well before that update.
---
I believe that it did. Aspect ratio is the key here, and I remember this working when I was a kid. I used to run arbitrary sized windows when I used to play in 2007 and it has always rendered correctly as far as I remember. 
---
Assuming it didn’t, that would still mean that one dev was able to implement a fix to GW and ArenaNet are a whole we’re unable to implement that same fix in GW2 a year later.
---
Oh how cute... he thinks it was just months
---
Although probably not well executed, my intent was more to underline the fact that for a very long time we thought Jormag was a male dragon and more and more clues are hinting to the contrary. 
---
I really like this fact and its irony. The sons of Svanir are known to be very misogynistic after all.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dyjk2h/the_potential_of_strike_missions/
---
Tell me how me basicly ass kissing Anet for implementing Strike Missions is doomsaying. This mode could save group content. I'm actually curious. The kodan strike mission could have been DAMN GOOD with a cm. Scroll down for my long comment.
---
I am not pleased how this episode turned out but as you can see from the entire subreddit the intent to start discussions about this episode is INSANELY low, same for me. I could start talking about the boneskinner (look what anet told us during the live event and compare it to what we got), about the map, about the weapon collecting being able to complete from the trading post (thanks for the 200g, guys) but why should I? Anet doesn't want feedback. I see the possibilties with Strike Missions as the ultimate pve game mode, I don't think Anet sees it.
---
Of all the numerous games I played, I never quite liked anything better than gw2. I just have reached the point I think where finished all the story content but can't quite motivate myself to content that requires group coordination or time commitment like fractals.
---
Engineer though /s
---
No, i got a weapon collection item. For a precursor collection i didnt buy yet. Like my title says.
---
And then make statues out of their bones? I like it.
---
Oh I'm at the beach in the sun relaxing after doing 3 dives before in the caribben ocean. So yeah I got some time to read while I'm chilling.

Peace out
---
I did that  4 hours ago and it worked.
---
I never did them all, but the ones I did really added up and covered the cost of the Pact Supply Network Agents easily. With this new system, I'll not even get all of that 36k karma, as i'll still only do the ones that I liked doing before. Guess I'll see how it goes. I'm glad Teq still gives the karma, lol.
---
Regarding the 3 chests per daily, for some reason I am just getting the 1 chest per daily, like before. Think I'm alone in this, as others seem to be seeing the 3 chests.
---
What pieces are those on the bottom character?
---
Yeah, right as I posted that and tabbed over to something else I realized that it's not gonna happen *because* it's a good idea. GW2 is pretty much a microtransaction shop with a buggy game attached.
---
There is also a rather interesting book hidden in the Meta-locked area..
---
Ice's bite.
---
Thanks, thought i was losing my mind.

Is there a way to just walk, like how NPCs do it?
---
Thank you!

I thought of the "special lion" of finland.

Assign a walk key in [control options](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Options#Control_Options).
---
Made this character day 1. Not a fan tbh.
---
I wonder what mechanics its strike mission will have
---
[deleted]
---
&gt;If we already have this mentality when the difficulty is just a little bit up
---
What kind of mentality?! To use game's group combat system at some tiny extent to achieve their goals?
---
I kinda expected this post to be all "gw2 players start to fail and drop out even with the slightest sign of difficulty", but then it makes A SUDDEN TURN and "this mentality" is the problem! Holy shit, this community is unsalvageable. 
---
Yeah, and obviously strike missions won't work as a stepping stone etc. At least now we can see the practical result of "easy mode raids" discussion.
---
Kind of rude to assume someone only holds that opinion to get upvotes. "I don't agree with it, and I imply that I think you don't either, you're only saying it to get upvotes." 
---
Also, there are way too many people that get way too angry that some people want to criticise the game.
---
Ok thx alot.
---
I must be one of the only people that enjoyed it.
---
But they don't. We've had this type of content for years now. Breakbars are far from new and are even featured in many metas dating as far back as HoT.
---
Damaging AoEs that are bright orange against a grey floor are pretty telltale, don't stand there, and have been featured in thousands of games with AoEs for over a decade now.
---
Will some learn? Of course. Will a large enough portion, given its been years since the implementation of these effects and they still don't get it/care? No.
---
Or you can just tank it and go live with your mom and watch MLP porn all day in the basement.
---
It was the first thing I checked at vendor, sadly they didn't make it...hopefully they'll release it in Ep2.
---
I don't care that it's free. I'd prefer for it to be actual content that takes a little bit of time and effort than have it be free, if I'm being perfectly honest. You can't market fluff content as free and then lean on the fact that it's free when you don't release *anything else.*
---
Oh I read your post. You never mentioned that you cleared it. It sounded like you were complaining that it's too hard. I never even knew about the cc phase and I'm playing casually nowadays.
---
Tired post is Tired
---
What the hell do you base that off of? Do you live in a high-fantasy world to have the experience to back this up?
---
Then if they can't learn the only option is to go back to the complexity of Icebrood Construct. I'm willing to see how this plays out
---
Well, the rage of players regarding this episode is understandable, after a series of debatable decisions, they deliver the first episode of the saga with nothing special, even smaller than the regular lws episode, even smaller than the prologue, without any evidence of "expansion like content", I kept saying that this release or the next one had to trully deliver something good, but so far, nothing. I'm usually defending Anet, but Im not able to defend such a lackluster release in terms of content, regardless of how good the story was.
---
Tldr: outrage at this point is starting to be justified.
---
I've cleared it. I feel I could clear it more with a competent group, but I've cleared it.
---
High five "haven't done Vigil story" buddies!
---
It's ok you just took a nap is all
---
You're gonna wake up real hungry, though. Like really hungry. Maybe have someone else take care of your raptor for a bit.
---
I'm staying on this sinking ship and I will complain about it all the way because I am a GWoomer
---
It looks worse though
---
I'll take a dead subreddit over a negative subreddit. Dead subreddits are still useful even without discussions going on; they still condense news and info about the game that isn't easily documented on the wiki into one place, and people are still available to answer questions. "Dead subreddit" just means (1) people stop creating content specifically for the subreddit, and (2) meaningful discussions about the game are no longer held, (in other words, people no longer treat the subreddit as a community hub outside of the game,) and I'll gladly sacrifice both of these things to kill the endless cycle of negativity. I'd rather this subreddit be essentially a quiet GW2 newspaper than the biggest internet salt mine outside of the Pokemon subreddit.
---
Well that goes with everything. That's why I said casuals are ruining games.
---
Edit: Aren't strikes supposed to be easy mode raids? Why need a beginner mode? This is the beginner mode.
---
Gw2 subreddit sucks tbh lmao
---
You're thinking of the megaserver system. While all maps are instanced, when a person refers to an instance in an MMO, they mean a small, limited-person instance, usually a dungeon, raid, or personal story instance in this case.
---
For small chest you need tier 1 mastery, for middle tier 2. But you need the opposing one to the chest type, rock-paper-sissors style. Not sure which beats which though.
---
And yes I think you also need at least one stack of the buff
---
Oh boy, where are you on the scale if 13 of those phrases apply to you lol
---
I had the same thing happen. What might work (50% confirmation) is to have someone in party on the map so you can rejoin after visiting wvw or pvp lobby to clear your inventory and try interacting with the chests again. I found 2 ingots after i got out.
---
Yeah I think there’s a bit of a budget difference between wow and gw 
---
Wow is a multi billion generating game and guild wars probably doesn’t generate 10% of what wow does
---
Maybe a nice solution would be to put the portals in locations you can only reach with HoT masteries (shrooms/gliding) or PoF masteries (mounts)? That way the copter still exists for those without and the portal is just a flavor bonus for those with
---
Yeah we do. Mind you I pretty much only play WvW and only because of my guild.
---
I checked out holosmith earlier this year and was intrigued but the forge skills felt really dull and apparently a lot of the power in engineer is camping one kit and spamming 11111?
---
I will add what Clayton said during the theatre event:
---
&gt; we're going to introduce this thing called a "boneskinner" and this thing is terrifying. It's going to haunt you.  It's going to set traps, it's going to ambush you, it's going to throw it's voice to trick you. It is going to be a force of nature in this map so you're going to be constantly looking over your shoulder to see where this thing is.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Icebrood_Saga_announcement
---
I was expecting this but sadly it was not the case. Your version sounds thrilling, I like it.
---
This is the absolute salient point about this chapter. We expected and wanted a smaller map but more playable content instead both are less.
---
I dont like baby lion :/
---
\&gt; Yeah, and obviously strike missions won't work as a stepping stone etc. At least now we can see the practical result of "easy mode raids" discussion.   
---
When I claimed the same when I saw icebrood construct, I was downvoted to hell and back, and told to wait for the next one.   
---
I waited, and my claims were not wrong.
---
Nah, he did it right, mostly. Black Lion is the name of the company, the Black Lion Trading Company. So the Black Lion's Lion retired... It should read I suppose as "the BL's lion" but that's just picking at straws.
---
I would have prefered to fight an icebrood version of her.
---
It‘s no Longer Mufasa. Now it’s Simba 😅
---
I installed Icewind Dale 2, old game , and remembered how hard was gaming before with no guides , hard mobs... i even noticed mobs dodge away when pressed ...
---
Dont think that such server exists. Every server has some special snowflake that tags up all the time but serves no actual purpose.
---
Actually, there's Piken, they are all snowflakes there so it works out.
---
Preparint the snow for wintersday
---
yea i made a track with the angled one
---
If you are just doing open world etc, go for it, you do you. In raids or fractals is will be hard if not impossible to combo your ice fields to do reasonable damage, so it probably wouldn’t work there.
---
Same. I think they overrode old helicopter with new one, so it's not selectable for prologue story any more
---
Even CC is trivial because you have special action key.
---
So [power Holo](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/power/) lost some of it's swapping with the drop of bomb kit but you still are using grenade kit for a couple skills and forge for your 3/4 all while using your tool kit skills, laser disk, prime light beam, blade burst, and sword 2 basically off cooldown (but again that requires lining things up and swapping modes). If you want more swapping and more skills [condition holo](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/condition/) and [condition engie](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/engineer/condition/) both exist.
---
Department of Redundancy Department 😉
---
I had this happen last night and eventually gave up. Sucks as I was hoping to play this new living world chapter. I didn’t know I was expected to have done the prologue
---
Lol why does it have both “only plays one build” and “pays for build templates” shouldn’t it be one or the other?
---
Jormag stopped you from writing erotic snow stories.
---
Which is unfair. Arenanet made many mistakes but I always thought that the game devs and artists are quite good. I played many games but some attention to detail I see here, even  with an old system always impressed me. I feel the decay we've been seeing is largely due to administration and that saddens me alot.
---
So......he lied. Surprising.
---
That's just a roller beetle wall, if you mount beetle you can just smash the wall by charging at it.
---
But what if we get an update the same size in december or more likely january?
---
&gt; Boneskinner uses the person's last screams to hunt. 
---
Reminds me of [SCP-939](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-939). [TLDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8_lH1DHIfI)
---
People who can learn can as well do raids. Strike missions were made for people who cannot and, as we see, have exhausted their potential already.
---
I don't think I already expected her to be 'dead'.  I expected her to be corrupted and to have to fight her.  So my expectation was sort-of subverted in the end, by simply having Jormag communicate through her to us rather than making her a minion.
---
And questions still remain.  Who killed her, the Svanir who had captured her?  Who buried her?
---
There is an option to go to gothmore from the new map's helicopter
---
Grats my friend, you noticed the point of the scene, the fact that we don't know whether to trust Jormag or not. You are the smartest boy in the game.
---
Spams shadow
---
Spams f1-f4
---
Spams scepter torch 1-5
---
They’re quite decent
---
Wow, it'll become a HUGE map!!
---
So, 1h gameplay every 2 months? Nice.
---
I don't have the roller beetle ;;
---
In the past the teams working on releases had roughly 6 months. We don't know when they plan to release Episode 2, but if we assume january the august statement would have been in the first third of the development process given a similar time frame.
---
And being 'not done' probably simply means that the equivalent of a golden copy has not been signed off on yet, which is what is to be expected at that time.
---
&gt; its harder than the previous one
---
Champion-level enemies are harder than the previous one.
---
Seriously game media are the worst. I don’t think they even play the games they review. I remember last month game reviewers complaining about issues in Death Stranding like over complicated and time consuming inventory arrangement (looking at you IGN) that literally can be addressed in 2 seconds with the very obvious “auto arrange” button. That tells me they didn’t even play it. I’m sure the same thing happens to all games.
---
Historically, with maps like Dry Top and Silverwastes, there were only bits and pieces of the next chunk of  the map, but never the finished thing.
---
Or, you know, Predator, where they use the voice of the people they hunted. :/
---
Then you were lucky to find it open and be able to get the chest inside, gz.
---
The game's optimization has always been garbage.
---
You can go ahead and try to do the same as he did, I would gladly see how you did it. Soloing bosses isnt tryharding, its just and extra content between big events and LWS. When people solo something even in a casual game, its because they want to challenge themselfs with something that takes time to do, if you dont like what hes doing, I can not understand why are you even on this post
---
&gt;Not what I said at all. 
---
You literally kinda did though.
---
&gt; I'm doing other stuff in addition to the episode. I don't stop working on other stuff, so a shorter episode doesn't phase me one way or another.
---
You're literally saying that the episode being short doesn't mater for you because you got other stuff to do.
---
&gt; However, if all I did was play through the story and get the achievements as fast as I could and I hung the entire game on it, I might be disappointed. But I don't play that way and I don't think most people do.
---
Are you implying that people who think the episode is too short rushed through it? 
---
No, the new episode is slow even you take your time doing it. The people saying its short are not "rushing it".
---
The new map and story are shorter than the vast majority of releases.
---
&gt;A small percentage of people are content locusts are really hard core players. Not all people. To them this zone is to small or two easy. To me the last zone, as good as it was, was a bit too long/grindy. They both have experiences they offer. Not every experience is going to fit every play style. For a guy who likes to get a lot of alts through stories, this zone is better FOR ME than last zone.
---
The new map and story are objectively measurably smaller and shorter than previous living world releases.
---
The map is half the size is the previous one and the story takes like 30 minutes to complete even casually walking though.
---
spoiler tag, pls
---
We see Kralk having a ton of magic from the others and he was far as hell away from everyone, the distance doesn't matter here.
---
She was the leader of the Vigil, so for a third of the characters that did Personal Story she was their direct boss.  She had more of a backstory established than the other Order leaders, to the point that there's a Hero Challenge in Iron Marches that's purely trivia from her background.
---
In Season Three, she flies the Commander to Bloodstone Fen to investigate what's going on there.  She later offers the position of Pact Marshal to the Commander, to replace Trahearne.
---
In Season Four, she shows up to Jahai Bluffs when Kralkatorrik attacks there to try to trap the returned Shatterer.  She leads the Vigil forces to Thunderhead Peaks to try to trap Kralkatorrik there, and is the commander of the assault on Kralkatorrik at Dragonfall.  Then, in Grothmar Valley, she's a "guest of honour" of Bangar, something she resents given his xenophobia, and has a song commissioned in her honour.
---
Was she a main character in the game?  No, but she's more than a footnote.  Her presence in the last four Living Story releases has made her come more to the forefront, especially compared to the other Order leaders who are much less notable and rarely appear since the Personal Story ended.
---
While it's true people have the right to be disappointed, I get the distinction impression that anything Anet does at any point right now is going to get attacked, not because it was bad, but because people are so angry about other things like build templates, the wait between raid and fractal releases, and the lack of attention to both PvP modes of the game. 
---
This reddit has developed a mob mentality. It's got the pitchforks out before this episode ever launched. 
---
I haven't seen a lot of people say I really like what we got but it was way too short. I only see people attacking as if this episode has no redeeming characteristics.
---
I have a guild of 400 people and there's not one person in this guild who's commented to me on the length of the episode and there were a whole bunch of us in the zone doing stuff yesterday. 
---
You can pretend if you like that this is just one legit complaint that is being fairly handled, but to me, this reddit is on the warpath and nothing would have satisfied them. First episode strike missions was way too easy. These bosses are supposedly harder. And there are three of them and we've only see one so far. 
---
At the end of the day, people aren't just reacting to this episode. They're reacting to their anger and using this episode as a focal point to express their displeasure.  If everyone was happy with the game prior to this release It wouldn't have received the reaction it has.
---
In strike, not really. It just excludes casuals, which is funny because it was made for them.
---
When LS4 tome was released, it was datamined that it will hold 7 scrolls so in best case scenario there would be 7 episodes/maps. They probably don't know and/or want us to expect  how many episodes will LS5 have.
---
Some people geniunly do not want to put any effort whatsoever into a game.
---
Yeah, I think someone with anet guild tag confirmed yesterday that it is bugged.
---
tell me tell me
---
Well as for me I never buy into Anet's hype speak. I went in with average expectations yet still was shocked by how non-scary that whole forest and boneskinner segment is. It just feels like any other map.
---
Look at OPs post history. Snargle Goldclaw is a reference Anet made in the game to OP.
---
I didn't say it had to be based on distance, specifically; it could just be Aurene absorbing the bulk of it, or dragons only being able to actually use specific abilities from the magic they absorb, etc. Or some other reason. I dunno.
---
Some of the people they laid off were experienced, highly productive but higher salary people.  Probably to free up cash to hire more newer and cheaper entry level folks (even during and after the layoffs they left their job postings up).
---
But building complex things like games isn't easy and has a ramp-up time, and it's usually the case that the more experienced folks are worth their salaries b/c they can produce faster.  Especially the guy who single-handedly made SAB, Mad King's Tower and other favorites like that.
---
Yes, they were smaller. And Phone Booth was a shorter movie and had less special effects than Star Wars , as well as fewer locations but I liked it just fine. 
---
Size may matter in some things. It doesn't matter in all things.
---
And no, I never said the only reason I liked the episode was that it was short, but I was relieved that it wasn't as long and grindy and Grothmar, particularly with regard to achievements and zone completion.
---
Oh come on. Dhuum CM is still a big challenge. It's easy to talk in hindsight at near 5 year old content with VG etc, but even W1 can still be challenging. Wildstar flopped for a reason.
---
&gt; I can't come up with anything short of putting a huge fucking wall in front of them with a note 'If you won't cc and deal damage you won't be able to clear this instance, which is btw solo only.' 
---
They'll just log off and go play Candy Crush  Saga 78. Maybe after leaving an angry post on forums/reddit.  They aren't engaged. That is kind of audience a-net seems to be aiming for, but I really don't see a point in maintaining a full blown mmo for such people.
---
What specifically is the issue?
---
This is by far the best horror content Anet has ever put out.
---
I am pretty sure I have given Arenanet fair share of chances to redeem themselves. I supported them through thick and thin. People just need to realize that they are a company, not your friends. they exist to suck money out of u.
---
&gt;I suspect a text tutorial that's accessible when you reach the strike mission (kinda like how they alert players to new stuff when they level up), that explains new mechanics introduced in that mission, would help a lot.
---
You know, I think I saw this somewhere. Not a text that you can easily skip, but a gameplay portion that does exactly that in a calm enviroment and with brightly colored telegraphs. What could it be, hmm....
---
Ah right, the very fucking first raid boss in this game, vale guardian and his boys. We're coming a full circle there. Or, rather, a downwards spiral.
---
Just destroy, havent unlocked the collection yet.
---
Well, if they would communicate with us, this wouldn't be necessary. No one knows what is the real way of feedback when they have complete social media blackout regarding everything.
---
Remember. Its a company, not your friend. You are allowed to be angry at them if they dont make their product worth your while.
---
Strange. I don't know where the problem could be. I did it without vpn.
---
A man can dream!
---
People want KP and LI and this class with x gear yadda yadda. You need to join a training guild then find a raiding guild ... ugh it’s too much for the investment for what people expect and it’s a catch 22.i flour not already in it I can bring a build and perform a rotation to DPS or whatever just explain the mechanics I might not know for 2 minutes. It’s not rocket science. I’ll bring my d/d deadeye and hit 1111111 😂
---
love your humor
---
it was shorter than the prologue in every aspect, which is unexpected seeing as how this was called an official episode while the previous one was arbitrarily called a prologue. i think if they called this episode 2, it would feel less like it underdelivered since it was supposed to be the first major chapter in the saga
---
&gt;Because 1 is a perfect implementation while the other is an imperfect implementation. 
---
Who gave you your computer science degree? Where did you gain this chutzpah?
---
"Going into". There's ALWAYS some repeat "festival" to clutter the schedule.
---
There only seem to be a couple of options for where he jumps to.
---
I entered the instance, placed a map marker where he jumped, exited, re-entered (you can skip straight to the fight on replays) and just ran to my marker when he hid - got it fairly easily.
---
you were in the group.  that's why we failed
---
even the 10 man content allways was and still is 2x 5 player content, looking at the group comps
---
i saw one, too. didn't know it was this common
---
Any good Reaper would be able to hit their chill field with 90%+ accuracy. It was an issue but cReaper is plagued by *a ton* of issues which all add up to its current state.
---
It's a potential truth. It could be another case of the use of an unreliable narrator.
---
But I don't think ArenaNet would include this if it were outright false though so I imagine there's at least *some* validity to it.
---
I'm eager to learn more about the Norn, the Spirits of the Wild, Jormag and whatever else is out there in this saga. It's good that we're already getting more information that expands our knowledge beyond what we've learned thus far.
---
For a relatively out of the way piece of information, this is actually a pretty big implication for the lore. It makes me wonder what else will change in our understanding of the world.
---
Totally can. I personally HATE build templates, both the implementation and monetization. It’s especially egregious considering ArcDPS was a solution already in place. But this episode wasn’t  heavily monetized or particularly buggy, it was a pretty good release.
---
Vale guardian does a good intro to VG's mechanics, but being able to figure out that red guardian needs condi doesn't teach you what moves do good CC on your character or why you need to stack.
---
Fascinating how people want to complain about how no one wants to raid, but then just want complete newbies to go into raids knowing everything except boss-specific mechanics, despite having literally no reason to learn them in base content.
---
Last month, I spent 5 hours counting how many pixels were on the lake doric quagan's asshole.
---
I still am to this day, I'm not actually done yet. That is playable content for me still.
---
How much cost to make one ?
---
Monday at 4:30pm Anet time.
---
Knowing Anet, we'll have to wait until episode 5 to get it probably
---
Yeah but imagine that you use any of your mounts to travel around maps and instead of going with it through the portal you need to click on some helicopter menu to get there.
---
And don't forget that packing raptor in that tiny flying machine would be terrible idea :)
---
Just logged in and I got a weird mail, themed around the idea that I was given the wrong HoM rewards, and that I've been stripped of said rewards.
---
Then, if I go to the EotN, the ghost of Kimmes has nothing to offer me.
---
However, I've got loads of rewards back from when I played GW1; the whole set of Heritage gear, the flaming sword... I still have the skins for them and everything (like the character I'm using to speak to Kimmes is wearing the Heritage gear and carrying the flaming sword).
---
Anyone know what the deal is with this? Is it some kind of bug?
---
If the spirits were minions, then why do the Norn actively say that some of them died against Jormag?
---
I've got a Sunspear Exile myself, a spell breaker.
---
Very cool
---
I think DSD will be the last one or pre last one if this Mother becomes enemy. I have theory that DSD is the one who influenced/corrupted Abaddon or at least he have some ties to him.
---
By the community, and because a lot of things were buggy is why.
---
I saw a sylvari NPC in the southern caves who talked about how the voice in his head warned him against betrayers in his squad, and the sylvari was very wary of his team members and told them to stay back.
---
So it seems Jormag can whisper to Sylvari and they can be successfully manipulated by him/her. Or at least that moron could. I honestly believed that after everything the remaining Sylvari had to go through, they would be basically immune to any form of mind control and moreover influence stemming from voices in their heads. All the weak ones had already been culled by Mordremoth.
---
As opposed to putting your raptor in your raptor pocket.
---
I would have thought people would have learned about overhyping and underdelivery after HoT...I guess not.
---
I'm playing them and enjoying myself greatly. The people on the pokemon subreddit just took the bad news of not getting all pokemon available in the new game and tried to spin that into that the new games are completely bad on every level by trying to nitpick stuff into oblivion. But then the game came out and surprise, it's still a pokemon game. People will enjoy that, they don't really need access to all 1000 pokemon that exist nowadays for that to happen.
---
Holy shit! I thought i had gone a bit insane, never crossed my mind they might have changed it :O
---
Anet made a promise, anet failed to uphold that promise, due to them failing to uphold the promise the game is in a dire state, and players are calling them out on it.
---
Where's the problem?
---
You can't have your cake and fuck it too you know. You can either give no communication but give content, or you can give little content but keep communication up so players know what to expect.
---
Anet does neither.
---
Then again they may not know  about /wiki.  
---
But yea i fuckin agree with all your comment in this thread. You might actually be the 2nd coming of Jesus with this mindset xd
---
It's a job, not a hobby.
---
Players asked for more charr faces do here it is, a charr cub.

You can partially bypass this if you have some loot that appear in the Hero pannel, like equipment and upgrades. https://i.imgur.com/SQPeIKP.png

MO is easier, I'd say. These bosses actually move around and require you to break a break bar. I've straight up tabbed out during MO for a few seconds and been fine, here the AOE's will kill you.
---
It's offscreen magic.
---
What is the tendrils club?
---
It's funnier when you consider how many posts about the nice launcher simultaneously complained about the actual game not reflecting that in the character screen.
---
Idea looks great on paper, but I guarantee you it would be one of the worst designed and least played areas in the game with such mechanics.
---
they could counter that by just giving it an arbitrary number of slots... let's say 69.
---
Shhh dont talk to me talk to the pipe

Gw2 was a game I would play for hours a day without remorse. I had loads and loads of fun. Queen bee was the only infusion and it was around 600g (expensive, but attainable). Armor sets were being made and sold on the gemstore, life was good. Something happened over at Anet and suddenly only outfits were being produced, weapon skins were locked behind predatory rng in black lion chests, chak egg was added and was never a realistically attainable item, and then a cool new infusion was added and attainable by acquiring an in game currency (celestial). Not even a week after release, the only parties on LFG for Cm's were "experienced" or "10 kp + title required". I made my own parties but no one knew what to do or how to even have an efficient rotation, too many parties failed over and over again. Basically, the hardcore community was given a cool reward and the casuals were left in the dust trying to even complete the CM once let alone go for the title. I took my anger out on the game (and Anet) because of the immediate polarization in player-type which had already been strongly present in raids was now spilling into fractals. It was not the people. It was the fact a game I loved was spiraling down hill very quickly from its original fun vision of including everyone in meaningful content. Basically, Anet used infusions to drive the economy knowing that they would not be attainable by the average player and I never forgave them for that.

I think people are leaning toward the sea dragon somehow being involved because the devs mentioned a strong Lovecraftian influence (who's writing often involved creatures from the deep), also the Living World Magazine gave us our first tidbit of info on Bubbles in a long time. If they are building towards ever doing another expansion, there's tons of potential with a Bubbles arc. Heading towards the Unending Ocean, reworking underwater combat to actually be enjoyable, Elite Specs to enhance underwater combat, having Largos as a playable race, etc is all expansion worthy content. But this may all be wishful thinking haha
---
None of the Dragons "eat" their minions, much less when we've been Zhaitan can absorb magic THROUGH them.
---
Ugh, Sorry looks like my memory is not that good(but I did remember the right area!). Went and did this instance again on my second account(for the first time) and "Ice Bound" completed when I picked up the scepter on the table.
---
I don't know why you thought that.  Anet's giving us exactly what people asked for (maps similar to dry top, which was revealed slowly).  You guys keep asking for stuff that allows anet to easily use to cut corners, and then act surprised when anet cuts corners, and gives us whatever takes the least amount of effort.
---
I thought I was simply unattentive to miss that part. We spent a whole lot of time following tracks (really week made sequences!) and free that other person. Then we find a letter saying "meet me over there" only to find what we found. No explanation, nothing. Idk, I have no clue why she had to die other than arbitarily making drama..
---
Wow, that's good stuff.
---
It wasn't about it being Jormag's voice, it was that this thing is able to get into people's heads, including our own with that offer.  That the offer was not made with a threat, and that my character's reaction to it made such perfect sense to me.  It was one of those tiny moments that made my character feel real, and Jormag too in context.
---
only portal scroll is available now, from karma vendor, not tome, or probably the thing u mean by calling portal stone that holds all season 
---
5 portal scrolls - stone? stoned tome? - thats the thingy we want
---
A year ago people finally left. The process itself has been going on for years.
---
Or you could just wait 2 hours?
---
Try to start the Prologie again (or literally any other story), wait a bit and then start the newest episode again. I had to do everything after the first story instance again, but it worked.
---
If you want to wait for a fix that may or may not come this is the only way to do it on the bugged character. If you don't care about the character, you can do the story with another one.
---
That all just seems stupidly complicated to me. For players and devs. Who wants to keep track of junk like that? Would make way more sense to standardise it all, but I have played other games with the same issue. Makes you wonder what people are thinking when they design content that is out of sync with everything else.
---
And to get Path of fire you must pay. I think we broke the mystery mr. Dovahbear! It wasnt that hard though, wonder why others dont get it.
---
&gt; None of them seemed to have Mordremoth's though so Kralkatorrik probably didn't had it that much and his minions didn't received/absorbed it or in best scenario they did but it was miserable portion.
---
My exact quote. Don't choose what you want. 
---
He indeed got these powers, I never denied it. I just said that he 
---
&gt; Kralkatorrik probably didn't had it that much 
---
since his minions weren't "blessed" with this power.
---
Not OP, but why would "visual clarity" be objectively more more important than user preference, especially when considering a person defending the change acknowledges "[They] like [the] previous design better"?
---
Oh, I'm glad that shaman datamined it so quickly.  The full map border, strangely, is exactly where I thought it would be.  We had to extend west to the water because Drakkar likes to hang out there.  We might go underground like you think, but they could always just open the closed doors at the western edge of the current Bjora Marches.  The ones right next to the Strike Mission location.  Thanks for linking that photo though!  Really confirmed my suspicion.
---
Players wanted less maps but similar or more playable repeatable content ie. shifting development from resource intensive areas to areas that would lead to greater replayability. Instead EAnet are giving less maps AND less content.
---
Well its on you to not go for the least profitable way of making gold and then buying items off of tp. You are missing on soooo much freeee connteeeenttt.
---
of course that was the intention with Saga. each Saga episode will release in the months which dint have a festival scheduled. As result players will return on a monthly basis (including festivals that is).
---
These returning players must not play for hours on end. They only must cough in between 15-30 Euros on the gem$tore and see you next month buddy.
---
Friendship didn't end with Aurene though she's trying to sort out Kralks destruction.
---
I've played off and on since launch.  If there isn't anything for you to do at this point I would recommend my approach.  Find something else to play, come back after a while and see if you enjoy it again.  Anytime I find myself not enjoying the game as much I switch gears.  Healthier than just stickng to a game with nothing to offer you and creating negativity for a lot of players that are in a different situation than you.
---
&gt; lmao, you consider it "a good job" and by your admission you "don't care" that they fucked up half of the items on the list.
---
Yes. That is what I said. I "don't count the fuck-ups" because they are completely irrelevant to how I enjoy the game. When they fuck up something I *do* care about, like when they locked Envoy armor behind raiding, then *that* I care about. But templates? Can't be bothered. 
---
&gt;Twitch is extremely important for any long term game. 
---
Lol, no. It is important to *some* games, which have build their audiences around streamers. It is completely irrelevant to many other games. GW2 might gain *some* benefit from Twitch streams, every little bit helps and free publicity is better than no publicity, but it certainly does not require them.
---
&gt;Quit parroting this bullshit that it doesn't count because it showed that you were wrong.
---
Again, it never "showed me I was wrong." I never made any claims about people not *watching* raids, I said that people didn't *play* raids. As near as I can tell, only 60 or so people actually *participated* in the ERP? Yeah, that seems about right for the GW2 raiding population. 
---
Now, if you told me there was an event in which 20,000 people were *playing* GW2 raids, *then* you would have some supporting evidence for your claim that raids are not just a niche joke gamemode. 
---
&gt;You want me to sit here and rewrite the entire script for you...?
---
No, I'm just saying, if you think that the story mode could have been longer without weakening its pacing, you could at least point out where an additional scene could have been included. I'm not seeing it. I think that anything they added would just have stalled the plot they were trying to cover. 
---
&gt;The release has a smaller map by pixel count,
---
&gt;a shorter story by literally any measurable metric, be it time to finish, dialogue or reveals,
---
&gt;less achivements, 
---
Not sure that's accurate, but I'll let you have it for now.
---
&gt;no accompanying release and no additional content like suns refuge or legendaries/raids/fractals.
---
Sure.
---
These are all facts, facts we agree are true. But it is your *opinion* that this is definitely a *bad* thing. It's my opinion that it might not be. What you see as "not enough stuff," I see as "economical." It's a small but tasty meal, rather than a massive portion. It's a compact car that's fun to drive rather than a giant truck. 
---
Like I said, if they only release six episodes over ~17 months like previous seasons, and all six are roughly identical to what we got here, then yeah, I would consider that a disappointment. If they don't introduce any "game changing" mechanics over the entire season, then yeah, I would consider that a disappointment. But I enjoyed the overall *quality* of this release, even if the quantity was a bit lacking, and if they can make up for that quantity issue over the rest of the season, then I would be fine with that. 
---
&gt;This is the content that's supposed to hold us over until the next release. 
---
We haven't gotten to the next release yet. I can't yet judge how well this has held me over. You've already asserted that you just "play two hours and then flee," so I don't expect them to ever "hold *you* over," making that portion of the discussion moot for you. 
---
&gt;Except this episode has both shitty content and a tiny ammount of content.
---
What issues do you have with the *quality* of the content? I thought that for the most part they told the story very well. There was a solid sense of dread throughout, especially at the beginning (although the trailer did spoil a bit of the reveal there). 
---
&gt;What exactly are you waiting to "fully explore"? This map is less than half the size of the prologue and that already was short.
---
I'm very busy in the middle of the week, I don't have time to play a lot. I managed to get through the core story, get a few of the Mastery points around, and about half the map nodes that I came across, and then logged out. I still need to complete the map, finish the masteries, there's some collections and stuff going on, I need to see what the various events are around the map, I don't expect it will take me as long to cover as some other maps, but there's still things for me to do.
---
Oh you trickster you!
---
As far as we are aware only Aurene got Kralks magic because she was so close to him.
---
that's cute
---
Nobody corrupted Abaddon. He wanted to give the magic back to the people after they nearly destroyed themselves. Magic corrupted Abaddon.
