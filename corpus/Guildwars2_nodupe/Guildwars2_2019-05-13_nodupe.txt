The goal of course is to make it so people like you can come to the sub during the week and not be afraid. I can't promise it'll be perfect, but I am really hoping that between our moderating, user reports and this megathread it will be enough.
---
---
---
Well, yeah. I never really thought they could.
---
The Amnoon pass in the PoF deluxe upgrade is the best value while it's on sale.  It's only slightly more expensive than the other passes, but comes with extra things (character slot and makeover kit).
---
Good points. There are for sure more spoiler reports than exploits so I'll look into switching those two around by Tuesday. 
---

---
The only problem with the special notes on new posts is that a lot of times they only show up on the old desktop reddit, meaning tons of people don't see them. But I will send a note about that to the team member who handles the CSS and see if they can add something.

It works terribly, so basically not at all. I pretty much entirely avoid pvp because Anet seems to not give a shit about balancing things or making matchmaking fair.
---
How about the green skeleton tonic skeletons?
---
I love it though. I find it amusing that I get random conversations like that. Though it's repetitive.
---
You are right, its visual effects are amazing. It seems like revenant has always been built this way, and having more flashy effects than the rest.
---
Not entirely true. You can skip the base game *if* you pay extra.
---
It's a very stupid idea to decide to do that for most players for numerous reasons but the option is there.
---
Also XIV base isn't free and if you buy at the right time then you can get basically all the XIV expansions and base for about the same as base. It only makes sense to buy them together.
---
Warrior (spellbreaker). You can go to metabattle website for some easy setups.
---
There is a trial for PoF? Is it doable at my current level?
---
I guess high ping is a valid reason to say "sorry i can only play dps" /s
---
English! SG specifically. Indonesian Players generally like to speak in their national language.
---
Yeah of course i want to look cool ~~what choice do i have if i cant play well~~
---
Understood on the mounts. Raptor is already heaps faster than running.
---
12g is so cheap. im trying to look at it as how much i would like to spend on a skin. 10USD for an account-wide skin sounds fair. (looking at apex fking legends. one fking skin almost 11-20USD for one fking champion)
---
Shiro + swords means you can hunt down any other player very quickly. Shiro also gives an escape option, plus superspeed. I will admit though that once you engage with another player you're going to have a hard time getting away for the most part. Luckily you should have enough power not to need to get away in most even fights
---
Also yes I run glint + shiro for wvw. Glints abilities far outweigh dwarf and centaur for pvp content imo. Dwarf isnt a bad choice but it doesnt work out well in my experience
---
Older than Rata Sum and abandoned ages ago, the ruins of Rata Pten can still be found near Mount Maelstrom. We know from interviews that the original asuran architecture was repurposed Utopia assets, and that the official "canon" explanation is that the asura found the ruins on the surface and reinhabited them.
---
More knowledge on this pre-underground surfacedwelling asura could be interesting.
---
I hope I'm still gaming at 79. That would be awesome!
---
missing psa
---
In the sound options check Disable Player Chatter. Voila your legends will now keep quiet :)
---
I would say that the game's UI could do a better job of explaining the different chat channels. I'm a veteran and still had to look up just the other night how to talk to a team.
---
these comics are great, maybe sit back and take a laugh for once and get off your high horse..?
---
I'd laugh if they were funny.  These aren't funny.
---
yeah good luck with that  
---
i certainly didnt have fun playing f2p for 2 years until i bought both expansions
---
I'm glad you're not, too.
---
You played a game for 2 years..... and didnt enjoy it?
---

You also left out 'Low frame rates, running best rig money can buy, help'

My characters are named to annoy everyone who sees them, hence the picking of polarizing politicians from both sides of the aisle.
---

---
why "do" you play games, if not for fun?
---
A nice scenic view of the valleys and hills, before it cuts back to your characters cold dead corpse.
---
cuz i dont have anything else to do
---
We find a way to go back in time to before we killed Zhaitan and harness the Energy of all Elder Dragons to bring Aurene back to life. She then helps us the big evil purple threat in the present, which is of course Th... Kralkatorric.
---
sorry to hear that
---
Honestly, they *are* a minor convenience.
---
I own the Amnoon pass because I bought PoF Deluxe, but I still just end up porting to a town anyways. 
---
Either way, you have to teleport to a different zone. Most cities have all crafting spots and trading posts in the same area anyways. I would spend the Gems on something you would enjoy cosmetically.
---
Nice try, you arent gonna steal my keyfarmers name

Agreed, but the dye channels doesnt match though :/ bummer

Please, spare the TP. It's barely holding itself together as it is.
---
NO WAI!
---
Not trying to argue, I'm just genuinely lost here. [Stuff like that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bmk381/level_one_area/) is cool, but creating an actual video of ingame gameplay is low effort/-value? The fuck? Isn't the sub littered with lazy screenshots of mismatched textures labeled "Literally Unplayable"? Compared to these this video is maximum effort.
---
I genuinely don't get it.
---
where's EotN?

Key Pun It Real

Hit me up with that money making method fam.

Can you give me any contacts? I am happy to pay for a run

***"I commissioned this art of my character from VictorTan "***

(That guy's really good at what he does though"

Yeah, i read the book, its just that in the game you can literally smash her eggs, kill her, and loot her corpse.

The Rytlock I got with the collectors edition is the only collectors figure I have, and he‚Äôs sat on my desk next to my monitor, unmoved for the 7 years.

Anybody in us server doing hero point train in hot? I am willing to pay / tip!
---
ayy lmao

ah, yes. the Realm of Torment
---
You read it lol
---
The day and hour of creation cause I'm too lazy to check gw2timers. Laziness does make you resourceful. Probably.
---
hardly anybody cancels animations in real raids. that comment is off-base.
---
gw2 raids are predictable to an extent. some bosses have behavior that changes depending on health percentage and for the most part they stick to certain attack rythyms, but you would have a hard time writing a acript to reliably complete most raids. there is a degree of implicit reaction necessary.
---
i havent played ffxiv, but it sounds like you're into predictability. probabky going to have a bone to pick with some fights, and not others, in gw2.
---
I wouldn't necessarily say I'm into predictability in and of itself, but rather predictability as a facet of optimization. FFXIV's predictability means that you have a really satisfying progression loop as you learn the fight, and it means that optimization can get really intense and [*really* in depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHNKXRxt3jY). That optimization in particular is what I love about FFXIV raiding, and especially FFXIV healing.

Sucks to lose all that gold, but no point in being salty at Anet for that. They won't help anyone that gets scammed because they put faith in a stranger and mailed them lots of wealth.
---
Asura and charrs are what GW2 has that no one else does.  Human or norn porn would be completely pointless.  Sylvari are plant-ish humans, it's basically just a skin texture.
---
That‚Äôs the shitty crux of it. You can. It‚Äôs just easier for baddies to scam you. Anet could prevent it.
---
I originally play in NA (playing from Indonesia), usually get around 250 ping minimum. But after they move their server to somewhere else it got really bad, 350 ping is normal and it can get as high as 500.
---
Got fed up with the lag and I tried making new account on EU server, ping is definitely better there as im getting stable 200. Moved my primary account there and have no regrets whatsoever. If you're from SEA then I suggest try playing in EU servers
---
Makes sense. Gw2 definitely isn't like that.
---
Also missing WoW refugees.
---
Something something forbidden knowledge.
---
I used to spend $50 a month. I've slowed down some, but I still spend quite a bit. I have the income and this is my main hobby. It's STILL cheaper than any of my other hobbies.
---
Ah, yes. The Blood Legion Homelands.
---
Heh, a year or two before I started playing gw2 , I found one of these at a store, and it looked interesting. But my mother told me not to get it cause she didn't like the look of it.
---
Fast forward a few years, I got into it when the base game became f2p aqround HoT launch and she thinks it's a great game cauze of how much I socialize playing it.
---
I just did a full circle, having quit GW2 2 years ago, and went on to FF14, ESO, Neverwinter, WOW and back to GW2 this week, in that order.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Some other thread summed up GW2 in a line... "It's a game where you quit 50 times, but keep coming back".
---
GW2 has no end-game gear progression... once you get your ascended level gear you're set. Everything else is just cosmetics. If you really really wanted to optimise you'd work on your infusions and the legendary gear from raiding (again, all cosmetics and achievements)
---
This means you're free to do anything and everything at your own pace, since there's no drive to be "up to date" with gear. You can even do everything already with Epic level gear, which is so cheap to buy already from the AH.
---
I'd recommend you join 5 guilds (you can join up to 5 guilds) and participate in Guild events and world boss fights. You can even be a level 1 to participate in them.
---
Then do the full story, in order, from start to current. You will be mind blown. Try not to skip ahead.
---
Make it a habit to complete a zone fully (all quests, vistas, points of interests etc) before moving onto the next zone.
---
Ah, yes. The Spawning Pools.
---
Is that Caithe?
---
You do meet a ton of people in the game. What‚Äôs your favorite game mode?
---
You know it haha
---
Most of the existing in game TP filters don't vary specifically to the player. Sure, there are filters for current level and current class, but they are broad categories that don't change for each player. From an implementation perspective they can be indexed in the underlying database which optimises the queries heaps. Having a "locked" filter would require a join to the much larger "player unlocks" database table, which would not peform as well as the current queries.
---
So basically it could be done, but would probably hurt TP performance. Note that I don't actually know how the TP is implemented, but given when GW2 was developed, the above is most likely very similar to how it's implemented.
---
If staff didn't feel like hot garbage on necro, I'd probably play it over mesmer.  Really just boils down to how many weapons I like using on the class.  I also actually prefer mesmer GS to reaper GS.
---
There are no scythe weapons in GW2. The closest is a scythe skin for the staff, in which case there are many many classes that can use a staff.
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Staff](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Staff)
---
There is a staff skin that looks like a scythe. There‚Äôs no actual scythes like in the first GW.
---
&gt;GW2 has no end-game gear progression... once you get your ascended level gear you're set. Everything else is just cosmetics.
---
Fashion Wars 2 is the true endgame.
---
Now, have your friends make a Sylvari Gamora and a Norn Drax.
---
Thanks! :D I‚Äôm hoping on now I‚Äôll add you!
---
Thank goodness that's a female Charr.
---
I have the box for the base game and HoT but sadly PoF doesn't have one.
---
Are you using arcdps?
---
This is true, but if you're playing for the first time you really shouldn't be trying to hit level 80 asap while bypassing all of the mechanics that the game teaches you in the mean time. If it's your 2nd or 10th character then just use some ToKs.
---
Ah, yes, the Gate of Madness
---
Are you hitting on me?
---
I know i can't play mesmer so thats out of the question
---
Warrior look really interesting and probably my top 1 that im gonna try.
---
If i want more ''fancy'' outplay you say that thief should be the way to go? I have a HARD time bursting anyone as thief. I always find myself doing low dps and chopping hp little by little
---
&gt;You haven't really experienced Meatoberfest until you've tasted my beef curtains. The juiciest and tastiest meat at the festival. Tenderized through a special process invented by Mad Mardine himself.
---
Ah yes, the Desolation.
---
Id say every 5 or so I get someone who I'm assuming has tilted off the planet and 'doesn't care' and just goofs off in spawn.
---
Chun Key or her sister Mona Key (it's pronounced Mon-a-key).
---
This build will be almost completely useless in WvW, even in small scale roaming. You don't have enough condi application to out damage people's cleansing.  You're going to be an annoying mosquito at best.
---
SB power longbow is pretty damn strong in small scale WvW. Much stronger than your build in nearly every way.
---
Ah yes, Southsun Cove.
---
The most profitable map wide Meta event that even free to play accounts have access too. Followed by a massive chest train. Scrap all masterwork and lower equipment and profit.
---
Thanks for the advice.  I planned on using GS mostly and switching to SB for utility (interrupt &amp; retreat) and the random fights that might need ranged.
---
Ah, yes, Joko's Domain.
---
P4l
---
I never realized how every map name Arena Net has ever made can be such an innuendo..
---
Log in rewards and laurels to crafting material bags.
---
Or be like me and never buy anything nice and just save money that way!
---
I still have him next to my computer ;) even after several moves
---
Just watch the Quaggan. I think he fancies you!
---
Short answer:  craft them if you like gold, buy them if you like time.  
---
Honestly answer:  If you can't afford to buy it outright you should probably wait a while to craft a legendary.  It takes patience, but at a certain point you realize it's just a shiny.  
---
IMHO, get a few character slots and bank tabs first when they are on sale.  You will probably enjoy them more than your legendary.
---
Crafting is almost always cheaper even if you buy the precursor and all time gated mats. Most legendary selling prices are around 1.5-2X their crafting cost. The people selling them crafted them and of course want a profit for the work. 
---
Gen 2 legendaries can only be crafted so no choice there.
---
Not exactly sure if i can post names but, I just logged on and the first train I see is led by Kucavara in HoT, Emikadon in PoF. Though i dont know any people that has a regular schedule.
---
Hope that was helpful.
---
Well, if you want a Gen 2 Legendary, crafting isn't an option.
---
When I made Predator, I bought the precursor because it was sizably cheaper by that point than the crafting process would have been.  I've also made several Gen 2 Legendaries, though, and there's no choice but to craft with them.
---
He was the one who got me really into digital video game art at that time
---
Ah , yes, the pearl of istan
---
If by bad gimmick you mean the details of this certain spec then I have no way of defending it. The main idea here isn't the details but the pseudo espec that goes with either core specs or other especs.
---
Right to the point. Most of mmorpg developed were so short lived for this reason.
---
Not a threat, but an invitation ;)
---
Ah, yes. the Straits of Devastation
---
Thanks! Were they halfway through or getting enough people to start? Never been on a train before and wondering how it works.
---
Depends on what you have already. If you've already finished 100% map completion and the WvW rewards bar, then crafting it would save you a lot of gold. 
---
If you're starting from nothing and it's a Gen I legendary, I'd just buy it to be honest.
---
Hello! Just wondering if you are doing or know of anyone doing HOT hero point trains on the NA server? I'll happily tip or pay the person doing for their time!
---
Ah yes, the Heroes‚Äô Ascent.
---

---
Guild Wars 1 had outposts, where you met up to group with people. There really wasn't an open world in Guild Wars 1, but instances. So it was much like a lobby game, but I don't remember anyone ever calling an outpost a lobby, even though it served that purpose.
---
Part of the reason is that you could take AI NPCs with you to fill party member slots for most of the game back in the day and the entire game these days.
---
You're welcome...it was fun.
---
The build up for final battle mouse child vs 4th wall police was good why you ended it with one anticlimatic stab?
---
Ah yes, Gyala Hatchery.
---
Getting mats for my first legendary right now. I have a couple of questions:
---
1) hero choice chests give amalgamated gemstone. Should I get my 3 (DS Is too long, can't farm It daily) every day from the chests while grinding gold for the other mats or is there a more profitable option?
---
2) I have about 70-80 of every jeweler orb. Should I throw stacks of 25 of the less valuable ones in the MF or is it better to sell them all and buy the gemstones?
---
3) Gift of Desert Mastery is made with stuff I can buy for karma from heart vendors. Does that mean I can get as many gifts as I want? Maguuma is limited to 1 per character afaik, since its components are awarded on map completition.
---
You always have the weekend
---
Rheeeeeee
---
Friend them and queue when they're in a match.
---
Ah, yes, the Elon Riverlands
---
this. take all my upvotes.
---
 isnt it difficult to get there with a new account no?
---
Ah yes, the Jewel of Istan.
---
That's one big chicken
---
When Jaka Itzel isn'T on Fire... xD
---
Molotov Rocktail
---
Ah yes, the queen's dale
---
Ofc you won't, thief is 1st (unrealistic btw) and 3rd on tge dos benchmark (not gonna count power chrono twice). And is one of the easiest class to play. Aka the best to go pug in, high damage and easy to play, allowing to focus on mechanics with low effort also.
---
There is no scythe in game as a weapon, but you will find SKINS for staff.
---
Necromancer (mostly support and control)
---
Thief - daredevil
---
Elementalist (I think it's not good for PvP)
---
Guardian (support)
---
Ranger - druid
---
Revenant (strong control skills)
---
Mesmer (condi-dmg)
---
how is a legendary rewarding when you can just spend 200 ‚Ç¨ on gems, convert to gold and you are done? there is no achievement by skill or dedication in this bad game, its a game designed for casuals that can achieve anything by dropping money even though they are bad at gaming with terrible reaction time or iq
---
On Mathias you can be main healer with thief and have a heal alacrigade. Those 2 provide all boons for 10 man.
---
Ah, yes. The Underworld.
---
It's more like casual unexperienced first-timers with huge lag-spikes in your team vs. korean top pvp players with telepation.
---
Ah yes; Scavenger's Chasm
---
THIS IS SPARTA, not Murica. Also what exactly is the connection between bisiness practice and game patch?
---
I was thinking about this the other day. As a way to branch guild wars 2 with a hypothetical guild wars 3.
---
nothing wrong with whoring around for attention in an mmo, most people play mmos to compare virtual dicks, the problem is when those dicks are not earned but purchased and the possebility to be purchased is enough
---
the pseudo-espec is the bad gimmick
---
spend a week farming ingame or spend a day working in reallife and financially support the game
---
Ah, yes. Rata Sum.
---
&gt; Can this be tuned to be more forgiving?
---
Probably. If you let Anet know and not expect them to pick it up on a fansite.
---
Think he's trying to boast 1.) Bears are tough to take down and 2.) your weapons are pitiful against a bear
---
I get compliments on my character's armor look all the time, and none of it is from the cash shop. His weapon skin is, but it's one of the plainer looks in the game. There are plenty of beautiful skins in-game. :3
---
Awh come on
---
CPU 5GHz+ and GTX1050 or GTX2060 depending your budget.  From apps side, check out dx912pxy, which is not Anet endorsed though it makes a difference to FPS.
---
Today it would be May Thirtheen. 
---
I farm irregularly when I am in the mood for doing nothing serious and this helps me remember if I've already done it this week. Before this I used Keyrunnette.
---
I can spend 13‚Ç¨ each month for new skins in the cash shop that i like without being forced to pay it
---
That one is done quickly. 
---
The one where you have to check bushes isway more annoying.
---
I kinda wish I had the luxury to take days off just to play games at release lol
---
Well I'm aiming for gen 1 legendary and when trying to calculate time it will take me it's much worse if I start crafting now then to actually earn money through game
---
Bring some reflects and pulls. Did it on my DH and had zero problems.
---
Now think about a game where all the skins are in the game and everyone pays a monthly fee to support it. You can play the game to earn the skins you want by choosing the content you want to play.
---
It's simply better unless you are one of those guys who enjoy being prettier than others by spending more money. But I don't think you are one of those pathetics, I think you just have an aversion towards subs out of an irrational fear of wasting money.
---
Ah, yes. Nightfallen Jahai.
---
Try Saturday and Sunday mornings/early evenings - there will almost certainly be one going on.
---
They want money for the exploration and WvW gift, I see it as this.
---
usually Keyronymus. but lately i like acronyms like pneumatischer peter or hilfreixher harald and other stupid/silly names
---
That owl is like "I did all the work for that shit, gimme credit!"
---
Dungeon/cultural weapon and armor skins. You can find pretty good skins there. If you playing raids, check there. My favourite skins are White Mantle's (available after defeating Xera).
---
IMO the best skins are from blc (u can buy them in Trading Post).
---
Ah yes. (Home Instance)
---
"Knowledge" doesn't come out of nowhere. And you don't need previous knowledge of the game to understand chat. Especially, if they're talking in anything other than /s, they already changed it so it's not like they didn't notice anything. Nobody ever explained me any chat system in any game, and it never prevented me from using those chats.
---
Also, using lvl 80 boost at the beginning is a mistake (but has nothing to do with ability to type in a chat and see that there are channels).
---
let me guess, you were hoping for an infusion.
---
I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling triggered by the presence of LGBTQ+ people in your game. If you want, I can send you a list of maps we wont be passing through, so that you may withdraw to those safe spaces during the march.
---
It doesn't exist because of people like you. Whales make more money, sadly.
---
I don't understand but it was exciting and amazing. lol Keep it up!
---
Stat swap doesn't matter for me. I just want to have a legendary weapon because it looks awesome.
---
HOPE - personal achievement, first legendary.
---
Bolt - because I wanted a fitting sword for my holo. A lightning sword.
---
Claw Of The Khan-Ur - I wanted a charr-themed weapon for my charr thief.
---
Thank you :)
---
Yo that‚Äôs 49 rares, one exotic, a few t3 mats if I see correctly. For auto attacking. And that‚Äôs just on top of the rares you get from the world bosses already.
---
Thanks :D you can click on english subtitles !
---
50 boxes is nothing when you look at the possible drops from them.
---
What about just going away with red, close with green and burst her down? XD
---
Also for 481~ Obsidian Shards and 500 Dungeon tokens. These seem trivial at start but if you craft legendaries repeatedly they may start being problematic.
---
The best way to get in CMs these days is doing it with your guild. By this way, I run CMs (while having 30KPs) with players that have over 250KPs.
---
Or just make LFG first. Coming people don't ask for KP.
---
Unless you are only jnterested in the highest tiers of dungeons/raids... but even then you need to go through the gear grind anyway
---
Key necrodancer! 
---
(as I struggle with thief and usually go with lvl 20 minionmaster)
---
Ah, back when you could stand on a rock and auto the shatterer to death. Now that image would have to be a bunch of people falling from the sky!
---
Whats the goal of this build? Dump either power or condi, better condi because its less usefull in shorter fights
---
its fairly obvious this is all fanmade stuff
---
Ah, yes, the Fields of Ruin.
---
I used to play WoW for like 6 hours straight. Because I had to. GW2, I get bored after 2-3 hours. And this is exactly why I am never going back to WoW.
---
Anet can't keep getting away with this, throwing so many  friends our direction like that

Petey is so happy :3
---
yeah but with the basegame only, i would not be able to test out the runaway mount bug.
---
sadly. will they ever introduce asian servers?
---
hahah understood on the fashion. i havent seen the shop yet. hopefully i dont have an expensive taste. Speaking of those skins, do they have anything to do with the transmog stones?
---
Nope, beef is slang for vagina. Not that commonly used though. Mostly in the expression "beef curtains" - vaginal lips.
---
pls bring game to console. my pc is box of sticks and i spend all money on ps4. halp
---
But that's the best part of wvw, you can talk shit, from nazism to anime when you run in the zerg
---
You have 4 maps to talk with xd
---
They're titled as being "Super rare" items for a reason.
---
Weec Lyk Eyfarm
---
No. Weapons skins are locked to thier weapon categories. Pistols to Pistols, Axes to Axes, Scepters to Scepters, etc. There are a few Staffs with a Scythe model, but those are expensive.
---
For the time it took to get the boxes vs any other g/h ratio its quite terrible tho
---
Yep!
---
Ah, yes, Cantha.
---
Read up about mechanics? There are videos of how you are supposed to do stuff, especially in WoW xD
---
Blast from the past Well done!
---
&gt;Spelling is the correct arrangement of letters to write a word.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Grammar is the correct arrangement of words to form a sentence.  
---
&gt;Punctuation is the correct arrangement of marks among words in a sentence, to enable comprehension.
---
You are partially correct - the error is in his punctuation, not his spelling. No need to be upset about it, I'm simply pointing it out. :)
---
"We will have a dedicated Megathread come it's release." means ""We will have a dedicated Megathread come it is release."
---
Here we have a punctuation error since an apostrophe missed, blurring the meaning of his sentence.
---
If you write out the entire sentence, however, it is both a grammatical mistake, since the order of the words are not logical, and a spelling mistake, since "release" would be spelled wrong. Another error is "Megathread", which should not be capitalised and split into the words "mega" and "thread".
---
Is that explained to your tastes?
---
Have a nice day!
---
Meanwhile other people take days off to go to another job
---
&gt;&gt;I still use the "I am Evon Gnashblade" to simplify and less lag.
---
Noob here, could you please elaborate on this? A less laggy TP interests me.
---
I mean it depends on how they make it work.  Mesmer greatsword is a ranged weapon.
---
Well, I do the same. Most of the time I say 
---
hi, [role]

[killproof], title
---
Also some appropriate /ggs or 33/66%

But i dont shittalk

I remember playing pvp in the beta weekend and having absolutely horrible withdrawal symptoms.

They are not "greedy" compared to other studios. The term greedy is broad but games with very short life span usually grabs cash faster than a game that has good economic balance.

thats right, every single one of them is paid already multiple times except if someone got lucky on the first try with rng. they all get generated through rng boxes.
---
Consider that all the "Super Rare" items have the same droprate. Now look at an item which is deemed to be a "Super Rare" drop from Black Lion Chests such as the [Permanent Hair Stylist Contract.](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/38507-Permanent-Hair-Stylist-Contract) That'll give you a better idea all around.
---
you can type it in the search bar and it changes the tp layout.
---
How do I know if super rare in blc is comparable with event bonus box super rare? This is why its sunjective. They can call it anything and it means nothing. Drop rate numbers is information. "Supr rare" is not.
---
People in that game don't even read their tool tips when they level the old fashioned way. I don't trust a new player with no experience in how the game works and probably assuming everything is like WoW to read or understand a damn thing lol.
---
I've seen quite a few of these recently and wonder what rock people are living under to ask if one of the top mmos is dying.
---
The face on the skimmer is killing me.

nope I play a lot of high-end dungeons with guildmates daily and most of the other PvE dynamic events aren't really difficult anyways even if multiple players are needed to clear (the difficulty scales based on the number of players participating), you'll know soon enough when you buy HoT and PoF and join one of the meta events.
---
The reason I haven't gotten into raids is mostly because I don't have a static group yet (usually you set a time together to do these content with the same people). Most pugs nowadays demand high numbers of kill proofs (a proof you can link in the chat for other players) before you can join them, which I don't have many of. Also you need time and commitmment to learn the mechanics and what your character's role is in all the raid encounters, which currently I don't have much of.
---
It is comparable because you almost never see people get these items. If you did then the amount being sold on the trading post would have increased since the boss event started but it hasn't.
---
Ah, yes. The Chantry of Secrets.
---
As a rule of thumb, avoid Reddit on release dates. As much as you like to talk with people about the game about other subjects, trusting the masses is never gonna end well. Look at Game of Thrones for example. You simply have to avoid it till you get to watch it yourself. As for the mod team, it is gonna be one hell of a job yet again to be able to control this. But don't let people destroy your enjoyment of the game itself. You deserve it too you know, just as much as anyone else
---
Drop rates for all "Super Rare" items are likely so low they would not want to put numbers on the drop rate because it would put people off from doing the event. I would not call it bullshit as you have evidence of how low the drop-rate is from the Trading Post. 
---
Chak Egg Sac and Festive Confetti Infusion are the anomaly of the bunch with none currently being sold. Even so, since the supply for all other "Super Rare" items has neither appeared to increase nor decrease since the event I would argue that they have the same drop rate in these chests as any of the other "Super Rare" items.
---
You dont know that. If drop rates were the same, value would normalize. Unless they show true drop rate value you have nothing to draw conclusions from as items in that category are inconsistent and all over the place
---
You sir, are correct
---
Ah, yes, I have no idea what all the comments are referencing but let's go with the flow. ~~someone please explain~~
---
That's bout how long a DS takes.  Proofs require taking things until you rank up or get pips.  You're at the mercy of getting a comm that isn't weedling around with another Zerg (good for bags, not for rank, got me maybe a couple hundred wxp every hour) or playing the camp dance and hoping nobody bothers you (easier option).  Alternatively you can ramp up to t4 participation and wait for pips but that takes forever by design (also depends on how good your server is).
---
Ah, yes, the Mount Maelstrom
---
Ah yes. The ascent to madness
---
Ah yes, the Maguuma jungle.
---
Nice try making fast money by posting this on reddit, Cauliflower guy.
---
They aint runes of pirate they are Privateer ones aaaaaaaaaaa
---
*fissure of hoe
---
They are all names of GW2 &amp; GW1 maps, instances, story episodes, vantages points (and that one Endgame reference) that refer to Kormir's private parts as innuendos.
---
Then just tell us your specs.
---
More like they put it in the BLC. Every few months when they change the contents of the chest they also cycle in old black lion skins and the price plummets since the supply increases dramatically.
---
It depends on what kind of macro you set. [Here is a link to the the official policy](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013762153-Policy-Macros-and-Macro-Use).
---
I wonder what is between Knowledge and Truth
---
I don't remember the Shatterer killing her ü§î
---
I do know that and I think you missed my point:
---
1. Supply has not changed since the World Boss Event
---
2. If supply has not changed then there are not being substantial drops in ANY "Super Rare" items.
---
3. Therefore, Chak Egg Sac and Festive Confetti Infusion will not normalise (neither will any of the other "Super Rare Items"). 
---
4. I draw this from the fact that none of the items which are "Super Rare" have increased in supply on the Trading Post since the World Boss Event and therefore Chak Egg Sac and Festive Confetti Infusion will not see any dramatic increase in supply either.
---
Ah, yes, the Golden Gulch
---
Why in the hell am I being downvoted?
---
Thank you but I've already read that and it's still kinda unclear. I set macros to do things with one key instead of pressing 5 different ones.
---
Thats how i pronounced it in my teens
---
Thank you, I'll try it out :)
---
Yeah I got that, but is the "Ah, yes, x" something an NPC says somewhere?
---
Potato, potato.
---
I have a mildly trash PC which goes 2fps in wvw. Still i Enjoy the game
---
Ah, yes, the Sunspear Sanctuary.
---
That would imo fall under this point, thus being not allowed:
---
&gt; Each macro should represent a single action that requires user input before repeating the action.
---
Short rule: 1 keypress results in one action, apart from the specifically allowed (dodge-jump, music).
---
rule is, one key for one action.
---
If you do 5 actions by pressing only 1 key, its illegal.
---

Dude I really want brokeahontas atm after the new Trump drama but I'mma guess someone got right on that.
---
Anet is really confusing.
---
Change they way you approach it. It won't be wow, it will never be wow.
---
 
---
&gt;*do you do with strangers to know they are experienced ?*  
---
&gt;With these "tools" which create fake kp or Li it seems like asking to ping huge amount of kp/Li is useless. Or I miss something. So currently I ask for teddy bears or toilet paper ... but if I write this in lfg, I wait for hours. If I write 250 Li I've got people quicker but half of them use fake links.
---
is common courtesy to dont ask in lfg for things you dont have!  
---
that is the "whatever" mentality that triggers even more the "raiders community".  
---
If you want to go with your "HM mentality"  just dont lie.
---
If you really want to do raids in easy mode you probably will be better in a guild that can schedule the timers you can play. If you want to go in a free for all lfg them you can have way harder incounters! is not only about being easy/hard content is about you + 9 others that can be missing enough skill/experience to make the run smooth enough.
---
&gt; I just wonder if chill clear exist. Chill doesn't mean inexperienced. Just that you agree to spend time inside a wing. 
---
again just make it clear in your lfg or use a guild/friends. If you relly only the lfg is very rare to find 9 others that just want to chill.
---
What are the other small critters besides the fox?
---
Home instance cats?
---
And why no M.O.X. and Webby? We took them in like all the other animals.
---
Thats fine but these are post factum conclusions. If we were to be informed, we should know true drop rates on day 1.
---
What's confusing here?
---
Fuck Yeah!
---
The Commander is just trying to fill the hole in his heart of his missing warband mates and dead dragon daughter (yay alliteration!).
---
Sadly gw1 was even better. I still hop on occasionally and the amount of character builds and diversity is insane!
---
Like I have linked different keys on my keyboard and let's say I open up inventory and mail tab both together with one macro. That's two actions with one keypress
---
**How do you invite people in your squads ?**
---
I fullclear with a static an raid a lot joining LFG Groups over the Rest of the week
---
**How do you do with strangers to know they are experienced ?**
---
Most ppl can't fake more than 250li they're currently having so asking for more get's you ppl with atleast 250 less than the amount you're asking.  
---
Also most ppl that are faking are easily spotted just by the way they Ping stuff and if you're concerned ppl are faking you can still ask them to split Stuff. Even if you don't spot someone faking the performance will tell.
---
**When the raiders clear wings?**
---
Main Clear on Monday and a lot more runs over the week
---
**When did the HM mentality changed?**
---
In short it didn't.  
---
It's just on the earlier Days of the week ppl want to get their kills and can't be bothered with beginners or inexperienced players. After they got their kills a lot of ppl join Groups with low required amount of li training runs or even Host training runs.  
---
They are not in general toxic or "gatekeeping" they just want to get their Stuff done before helping others.  
---
*Yes there are exceptions*
---
**What Should I do to find a static on tuesday for example?**
---
If you can't find one create one.
---
**What if somebody whisper you "I don't have the kp, but I can handle this boss and I'm prepared" ?**
---
NO a clear NO if i wouldn't care about the amount of KP i wouldn't ask for it. *Ye ye call me toxic*  
---
This Person belongs into a training Group and if he did not lie in being prepared he brings way more than most ppl bring to a Training run. These ppl are mainly the reason i join training runs so they get their chance to improve/get their KP to join regular runs.  
---
At least on EU there are enough Training runs every week to be able to train all 6 Wings. If this wouldn't be the case this would be a different Story.
---
**Why Everybody (almost) think raids are hard content?**
---
GW2 has no hard content. PPl are just bad!!  
---
*bad in Terms of investing Time to learn their Classes/Bosses/Content*
---
A friend of mine is obsessed with support roles and really loves his heal auramancer tempest.
---
The thing in fractal is that, more often than not you can find yourself struggling because of projectiles and tempest can provide a significant uptime of magnetic aura that can trivialize/greatly tone down significant encounters.
---
For instance :
---
* Lava elementals in volcanic fractal are simply non existent.
---
* The pressure during the last fight of siren's reef fractal is much lower since most adds are ranged and the melee ones are cleaved.
---
* Harpies during uncategorized fractal can be either skipped or killed with great ease.
---
* Artsaariv's many projectiles can be nullified for an extended period of time which is quite useful. Iirc even Arkk's red balls can be reflected by magnetic aura.
---
* Generally speaking there are many projectiles in fractals.
---
In addition to this amazing aura, you can prevent wipes from mechanics with rebound, rez with geyser, have good anti condition, excellent uptime of vigor and protection...
---
All in all I would say heal tempest is not the optimal healer but probably the most confortable to run t4 and recs with. We have not tested it much in CMs yet for reasons unrelated to its performance.
---
I will add that it might just be better than druid in most parties that lack organization because its comfort will avoid disruption which may cause much more dps loss than not having spirits and spotter. Druid's current protection uptime is particularly horrible and dearly missed.
---
You do 2 Actions with 1 keypress what's hard to understand there?
---
I am sure the recent layoffs helped free up some budget.
---
I don't know if you chose the charms/symbols just because of the colors, but they actually make sense in comparison.  
---
 - **Space:** the *brilliance* of billions of stars
---
 - **Mind:** through sheer willpower you can *enhance* yourself
---
 - **Soul:** your soul *controls* your body
---
 - **Reality:** reality is *pain*ful, in a world in constant fight
---
 - **Time:** lets you improve your *skill*s

 - **Power:** comes through application of *potence*

question is pretty easy to answer: are you using macros for combat or do you bot some crafting process wher you would have to click 200 times and thats whythe price of that item is so high?  
---
if you can answer those with no, go ahead, no one is banning you for using a macro which opens you mail and incentory at the same time.
---
The Basenji you can get from the gemstore, the snow leopard cub from Bitterfrost, and Princess the karka hatchling 
---
I thought about it, but they would've stood out too much from the others, I think
---
Speaking of, I'm surprised M.O.X didn't have a bigger role after he showed up. You'd think Taimi would've been all over such finding
---
They'd probably just lie, though. On top of that, nothing prevents you from just being unlucky.
---
Specs other than druid that can focus on heal:
---
* Scourge
---
* Revenant
---
* Firebrand
---
* Tempest
---
* Scrapper
---
I have seen them all. Druid is just the most common option.
---
Exactly that what I was saying that confused me. I don't and can't use razer macros for botting or afk farming. I have to press the key and sometimes I bind different keys on one macro for easy use.
---
Well upper gold does not work at all, when i was there i got qued against top 10 players on the leaderboards at the time while my team was just normal gold ranks.
---
I agree, it would be nice to know actual drop rates, although I don‚Äôt think ArenaNet would do that because it would turn a lot of people off the event.
---
You'd think similarly of Dunkoro, who was preparing for taking out Joko. Would have made far more story sense to me if we went to him than the Primeval Kings and Queens who had no direct relation to Joko beyond some lies of heritage.

---
What? This isn't the official forum?
---
Why wouldn't they? The Lost and Apostate weren't evil, so they wouldn't be hunted down anymore by the Forgotten or Kormir's kind (especially the Lost which directly aided the Forgotten).
---
Buy pre, craft leggy
---
Exactly this. One of my friends often asks me how he should make gold and I always just tell him to work on whatever he wants to do next and the gold will come passively.
---
It is worth noting, however, that having a bag opener is useful for a huge amount of activities for getting the most gold you can. It's mentioned frequently for gold farming methods (RIBA), but anything that drops bags that aren't level-locked are worth opening on a bag opener. I just do whatever I want to do to make gold (for example, I'm playing through Season 4 on a different character with a new player), but I still save bags and open them on my bag opener to squeeze the most gold I can out of whatever I happen to be doing. Ultimately, opening bags on a dedicated opener doesn't take much extra time and is much more rewarding than opening them on your max level character.
---
What's the easy-only-water staff build for ele healer?

Ah, yes, the Verdant Brink

It's funny cause in some countries Rata can actually be used as a nickname for vagina.
---
This is actually *exactly* how I sold it to a friend who's a Skyrim fanatic! She's been having an excellent time playing w/ that mindset. I've described it jokingly to people as "Skyrim, but crossed with the Sims and Runescape" (exploration, fashionwars &amp; setting your own goals :P), but in retrospect it's... extremely accurate

I finished it all a few weeks ago, and it was such a pita, with all the extreme timegating. I probably spent months on it in total. Plus the elements of air and earth just didn't want to drop, I was running around in Rata Sum killing Sparks for ages... (Then I think one or both ended up dropping in Deirdre's Garden.)
---
I have fun with weekly raids and daily fractals, I also do a daily td meta till I have enough chak eggs for my second legendary armor, this way I gain around 30g per day if I dont skip any dailies, which I usually do, and raid reset is around 70g.

I would love that image on a big ass mousemat. One of those big ones that pretty much goes the length of the desk (or at least full keyboard + plenty of Mouse space)

Here's a tip I didn't see anyone else mention yet:
---
You will die. You will die lots and lots, but *it's fine*. Everyone dies a lot, and everyone can (and do!) ress each other, at least in open world PvE. Dying is okay, it's expected. Your gear will eventually break when you've died enough, but repairing is free, so it only slows you down a bit. Ranged characters die less than melee, at least in my experience, as it's easier to dodge and block attacks you can see. But expect to die a lot. ;)
---
The Path of Fire expansion brought glorious mounts to GW2. These mounts all have their own specialties: want to jump far? Get the raptor. Want to jump high? Springer. Plus, in the first expansion Heart of Thorns, the Glider was introduced, which makes moving around even easier. After you get the glider, you won't get elevatored.
---
Another thing I didn't see mentioned is that you don't have to group up to share kills and achieve a common goal. You *can*, of course, but out in the open you can just join in with people doing an event or killing a boss, and as long as you are active enough you'll get credit. I don't know if WoW has that too nowadays, since I haven't played WoW in years. But it's something I enjoy greatly in GW2, and it makes it easy to want to help people out - and to get help, too. No one needs to be an asshole who just stands around hoping for you to die on an elite mob so they can get the kill instead.
---
Farming mats is also friendly and easy since everyone shares the same nodes. No more being beaten to a flower by a pesky gnome who got there a split second faster than you! :D
---
It's also very hard for the common pug to adjust their builds slightly if they're running with an incompetent heal support, or even worse, swap character. üò±

Pvp in this game is dead due to mismanagement. Anet #1 in wasting resources, designing powercreep, neglecting balance and entirely ignoring what drives players. 
---
If you enjoy pvp, quit. Sure you can attempt to enjoy pvp until you get frustrated by anets incompetence and the sheer hate towards any competition of most of this.community, but why bother? Skip the steps where you realise both anet and most of the players hate competition and find another game. 
---
Sure combat is nice but it doesn't make up for the state of pvp.
---
It'll probably run, but it won't be playable in any heavy scenes.
---
You don't ever want to take time off for patch day! Historically, there have been releases where the story instance has been broken and kept crashing for most of the day. You don't want to skip work just to experience that.
---
Scourge is basically the same thing, right?
---
Very usefull. If I sum this up. The only way is the one I've done yet. Find raid community and lead trainings myself when I available. People will join.

You're definitely right. When I began few months ago, I just took time to whisper the comm' explaining my situation (low Li or kp but not bad in my role). And I've been more often welcome than kicked. After that, You have to be good but it's fair. (-:

Thanks for sharing your thoughs.

Yes, but that is because you clearly don't understand the term super rare.

If someone struggles to understand masteries i doubt it becomes any clearer when you explain things as cakes. Now he will be looking for cake tins all over tyria.

How many pearls do you get on average per run? I farm my gold mostly solo these days, so I am intrigued.
---
Bounty Glyph is crazy good on plant nodes for some reason.

My record was 21 but few times 0. It's a lot about luck

Thanks, this is very helpful.  I had thought it was just XP and you allocate points earned when gaining XP.  It seems I must also unlock or obtain mastery points which my XP can then be allocated to in order to progress with that specific mastery.  Good to know.
---
Ah I made my other comment without seeing this. Its quite nice, I will give a try :9

Low fractal tiers usually have no playerbase since they're basically worthless since Weapon / Armor chests dropp exclusively from T3/4 and after 4 years of constant the same content everyone should be at endgame (T4) by now besides the newest of players.
---
T4 fractal content is crowded with players tho, and you need to hard-filter the trash from good ones to fill your team.
---
PoF maps got nerfed so hard they're not worth anymore. Basic PoF maps were never a thing to begin with, maybe for bountys but PoF release was a long time ago and in the meantime everyone who cared got their bounty weapon skins from the vendor so there is nothing left to achieve.
---
Istan recently got nerfed 3 times again and again one patch after another and is now basically completely useless, back in the days you could farm it more than once a day ^(they took that), you could maphop for additional loot ^(they basically took that too) and there were way more champions to loot ^(wich they also flatout removed) so nowadays its laughable and not worth the gold/hour.
---
but but but.... ;c

Thanks so much for this.
---
Let's be real here, if we had that power, defeating Kralkatorrik wouldn't be the top of the to-do list.
---
After Tyria collapsed under the weight of a billion legendary weapons and armour sets, the remaining survivors would wander endlessly in a blinding multitude of infusion lights. We wouldn't be able to *see* Kralk.
---
Thanks!!! Me too, i love it. I dont know why it gets the hate that it does. It is an elegant longbow that isnt over the top.
---
 Ah, yes, Domain of Anguish.
---
&gt; this is what we call being carried. 
---
It's "carried" when the low-kp-guy is bad. When he/she's not, it's sharing experience. People better than their current Li level does exist.   
---
For example one year ago, I whispered a comm' who asked more than I had (many more!). The run ended with a DPS kicked and me whispered back "let's keep in touch, you deserve more than trainings". This particular day I was low Li but the squad agreed I helped carry some of them. And I learned more with them than in any trainings I've done before. Shared experience.

Okay seemingly, some of you seem to not know what a meme is, it's where you look at is and go "Haha, I can relate to that", I'm just hoping this doesn't go toxic because I'll be pulling the plug on this one then...
---
Since you have to effectively replace a Druid I can imagine there'd be some problems.
---
Like providing constant 25 Might, Fury, Regeneration and Protection also to a lesser degree Vigor and Stability etc.
---
Usually a Tempest really struggles with offensive boons besides having no unique ones like Druids and Renegades do.
---
I used to be 'good' at PvP in the old Guild Wars but I don't have the time or the interest for it in this second instalment. I'm just an occasional visitor for nostalgic purposes so my advice might be out dated but... 
---
As I recall, sure you may need your character slots, the best way was to just throw your self into it, talk to players, join a pvp oriented guild, read up on guildwars guru, and start taking the fucking beating. Over and over. Live die repeat. Your instinct for key pressing, timing, and when to save what, will only come from being under pressure and doing it a lot.
---
I have the Unbound Magic tools (Unbound Magic is very much like Volatile Magic except for Living World Season 3 rather than 4) and as far as I'm concerned I'm not sure they're worth the additional gems. You get a a small additional amount of said currency when you harvest resources, which is nice but won't mean much unless you use them a lot and/or you want all the Volatile Magic you can get your hands on for expensive things like, say, home instance nodes or the area buffs like Karmic Retribution. But still.. you can get plenty without the tools (otherwise it wouldn't be fair to those without said tools).
---
I got my tools when they were discounted, but there is something to be said for getting them as soon as possible as the additional time you'll have them will at least help you get a little bit more value out of them. And, yeah I transfer them between my characters. This saved me a little bit of inventory space (as I kept spare limited tools) but it's a bit annoying at times. But having sufficient shared inventory slots helps.
---
What I mean is that there is no link between the colours of the infinity stones, the GW2 colours, or the names of either. The concepts are too vague to correlate in any meaningful way. If the colours in GW2 were all switched around, your original comment could use different combinations and still make it sound as though it's a wonderful coincidence.
---
Lets be real tho, the "just flip the TP" meme has its charm yet its different work tho.
---
They have to be on top of current prices, research the I/O flow of different items they wanna flip, stick to the news or teasers to be the first to make some meaningful investions and they have to understand the current faucets of the market.
---
If it would be just afking at the TP, I wouldve done it already as well :D but that work up there is just no fun to me. I'd rather get bonus loot for auto attacking sponge bosses
---
&gt; I ran 12 and got 1 t6 mat
---
And 12 rare unidentefied gears.
---
I don't understand why everybody forget the guaranteed rare unid gear from each box. Sure you could say "but it's only one piece, mimimi", but compared to the normal loot of a worldboss (especially if you do a boss more than one time per day), it's a decent addition.
---
You could also say it's 0-3 Ectos each boss.
---
I've played the lottery enough that I think they should just hand me 40 million...

so this image is in the box?
---
and you got hooked to the game by an imagine inside the box of that very game that you bought?
---
Exactly. And that's what people mean by "wasting" xp. I'm not sure how you're using it. When people say "wasted xp" , they are referring to the fact that if you have hit a bottleneck and have all your masteries filled with xp , but not enough MPs to level one , any further xp is wasted.
---
It was very forgiving for years but that also meant that players were jsut moving around on the map hit one mob and then left for next hit one mob, left went for next and so on. This resulted in a very upscaled event for the 1-2 who were actaully doing it and the 30 who just hit a mob and then left and also tbh a very unfair way of getting rewards without doing the work. 
---
So that is why this was changed.
---
This thread is gold
---
I guess it depends on your sense of humor
---
Depends what you think is fun. I know it's not a popular opinion on here but I enjoy a mixture of ranked pvp and open world play. I've never farmed a day in my life, only play casually and I've never been short of gold. Not far off crafting my 3rd legendary and when things like the griffon drop I never worry about having enough gold. Not to mention I'm swimming in transmutation charges.
---
You don't need a squad to get the Warclaw. I unlocked it on 4 accounts so far in which 3 was not any squad related or any group related just me on my own moving on a map doing the stuff needed and then looking for a keep capture. 
---
I am not a Edge of the Mist fan at all so that was not a option for me but for those who want easy mode EotM can get you all but the camps. 
---
On top of that you need some tickets and badges of honor which you get whilst playing and making the collection. Calling this a farm is stretching the word farm by a far and that is what i was protesting against.
---
Fractals for sure, start low and eventually t4‚Äôs are fun, challenging and rewarding. Spending time in WvW or PvP completing reward tracks. Doing the metas with some friends.  Most importantly,  completing a ritual to the RNG gods for hope of good loot.
---
Nope. It's the Shatterer.
---
&lt;Kralk&gt;( [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/f/fe/Kralkatorrik.jpg](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/f/fe/Kralkatorrik.jpg) ) looks like a hammerhead shark.
---
Where was that post again? Cant find it anymore.
---
You're the toxic one because you call the box shit even though it didn't do anything bad to you :(
---
So, maybe you are trying to do too much at once. If you are really interested in getting into this game, then my suggestion is to learn the game. I'm not trying to be rude, really. Combat in gw2 is kind of fast paced, and you'll do a lot better in every game mode, be it pvp, wvw, raids eventually, if you know the class you're playing. Don't worry about more character slots. Pick the one you like and play it. Learn the skills, understand how to dodge and avoid damage.
---
Dungeons aren't really helpful at this point in the game. If you are looking for instanced activity that can earn gold while giving you an opportunity to figure out your class at level 80, try t1 fractals.
---
Wvw-look at the dailies and just familiarize yourself with the gamemode and the maps. Follow a tag when you can. Warclaw only gives a slight speed advantage, honestly.
---
Try not to "farm" or "grind". That's boring. Just play. If it's not fun and you are bored, maybe don't play. But you can do little things every day to make some gold. Complete the dailies, do fractals. Participate in some metas or world bosses like Teq. Gather materials.
---
I think if in city he will mybe have about 20-30 fps than in 2v2pvp probably will be fine. I hope!
---
It's not the event that is boring. Adding more loot to auto attack targets doesn't make it less boring.
---
I can't remember having an issue with this step... did you try double-clicking the the Enormous Foxfire Cluster itself?
---
You can do easy 25 Stacks of Might, Fury and Regen for 10 people tho.
---
Stab is 5 and Vigor is 5. 
---
Put the tempest in his own subgroup and you can probably give all 10 people vigor. You can also ignore Stab and take 10 man Stunbreak.
---
The only thing druid has are Spotter and Spirits. Both arent unique to the Druid and can be taken by a Soulbeast.
---
Tempest sure wont struggle with offensive boons.
---
And that keep capture needed a squad. whether you were IN the squad is immaterial. It needed a squad doing it , to get done.
---
Although I agree in theory. And yes EotM makes it pretty easy. But again , someone clueless enough to think it's hard won't even know that's an option.
---
Longbow actually didnt have a much higher dps compare to Shortbow. Both auto attack does similar damage ( SB Dps = LB 500-1000 Range Dps). With LB you only gain Range and damage from Rapid Fire that have a 10sec CD...
---
IMO you can just stay with Shortbow.
---

---
1 - 30 days.
---
Yes, I double clicked it, it showed me where Aurora's Remains is.
---
Yeah I'm playing both parts of a Firebrigade as Healers in CMs and can't imagine failing because of too low hps (well on Renegade I could but only because they're more Boonsupporter than actual Healer, much like Druids) usually my DDs die because they didn't dodge some of those nasty oneshot mechanics not because of frequent high incoming damage.
---
I'm testing my hps in the Golem arena and are quite happy I can counterheal the area damage if its set to maximum, i can survive there for minutes on end on Firebrand - not so much on Renegade.
---
Nope, it's in a normal 20 slot box at the top of my inventory. Thanks for your input though, nothing is silly, I really appreciate it! :D
---
That's some tyrian ass there.
---
I think they did know. The trailer was unlisted on facebook on the Tuesday last week. They just wanted to finish the requiem story before releasing the trailer.
---
&gt; Just curious how long i should wait before trying a different route
---
3 business days
---
I guess
---
Its really cool finding other supporters on this platform!
---
I main Healbrand, Renegade and Chronomancer and you're right - imo way too few Chronos out there use Rune of the Pack. Most of them use Eagle or Sholar because of those gimpy Buildguides online wich focus on the wrong parts of being a "Support".
---
Thing is you kind of need to provide those Boons in fractals because all other Healers or Boonsupporters can guarantee at least some uptime if not keep them up 24/7! Scourges, Druids, Renegades and Firebrands can easily keep up those Buffs and also loose no real healing to begin with. If you want to compete with others you're automatically forced to hit their baseline performance while also healing or at least trying to. So since you have no access to Staff how impactfull is your healing while trying to prolong Boonduration?
---
Most Tempests I pugged with really struggled to provide offences so it was usually a clusterfuck extending bossfight durations that significantly. Coming from CMs you really don't want to stack bossmechanics on top of each other because you lack the damage to pull through them quickly.
---
I'll ask a few questions and then try to go from there if that's alright.
---
How old are you?
---
How much time do you spend ingame?
---
Have you used outside sources to see/watch/hear/learn about the game?
---
What kind of gaming hardware do you use?
---
(mechanical or normal membrane keyboard, 204729 button mouse or a regular one)
---
Thing is, without knowing anything about you, there's hardly any really good advice someone can give you except "play xy class" or "git gut" or something.
---
Ah, yes. Elona: Land of the Golden Sun.
---
Ah yes MOUNT maelstrom
---
Actually story wise episode 5 was fine.
---
Photobombed
---
Tempest can overload air to grant a single buff of Lightning to allies. It‚Äôs not much but it is a unique buff.
---
Druid no longer give perma boons outside of 25Might Fury Regen Swiftness. Those boons can easily be given by other classes. You just need to adapt and no longer give all the job to one player. In fractal, Tempest healer could be really interesting for condition removal potential when you have instability that provide a lot of them. Druid always lack of condition removal.
---
Probably because those posts are old and rev hasnt been a great pvp class during mid-late HoT and early PoF.
---
Because of its old engine, GW2 will be playable on almost anything reasonably modern but isn't going to run really well on anything. Unless your friend is trying to play on a 15 year old budget laptop with integrated graphics, they most likely will be able to play.
---
Meh I ain't picky
---
The amount of unoptimized mess this game is, is unbelievable. This CPU is generally known as a beast and even that one can't get good FPS
---
Me exactly XD. Except the "Not far off" part.
---
They also have conv stuff like infinite mining pick, inventory slot expansion etc
---
&gt; a pro league team
---
is that a joke?
---
Googled what you quoted, Feb 9, 2018 was long time ago.
---
&gt; low to high skilled revenants are terrible, but pro revenants are valuable
---
This would be true, for most classes..
---
Honestly I'm fine with it, helps to continue getting us great stuff.
---
Any WB will drop his unique loot once per day. This reward is shity on average, but each WB has some specific drops, which are obviously rare, which is the reason players do WBs in the first place. This event was something in addition to it and it is unlimited per day.
---
In addition, you get 1 rare unid and some mats. It contains some very rare drops, which are in fact very rare. If infusions and t6 mats would just rain with each boss kill, which can also be multilooted, gw2 economy would be damaged to the point of no repair. In gw2, most rare and luxury items are cosmetic aura infusions. Now, this is not designed for random casual player or top 10%, it is designed for very few players, which are like 10-20k, which have 100k+ account wealth and basically nothing else to work towards. Now imagine that every casual which opens 20 special boxes gets an infusion. This would completely devalue existing infusions, which are very limited (crystal, confetti, chak) and basically ruin the game for those players first and later to everyone else. How does this effect every single player in the game then? Basically, everyone who does fashion wars does so to show it up to other players and to be cool. Same reason why people want to look nice or have nice things in real life. You dont walk around your house in gucci or what ever brand is luxury today. This is also the reason, why they will never add an option to not see legendary weapons from other players. But this showing up, has synergies with every single player in the game. Vets and wealthy players can show up their achievement and what ever to others and others get excitement from seeing it and imagine how their characters will look after they become vets. 
---
Rare infusions are rare and should remain rare and if you promote devaluing such items, you are promoting destroying the game and reasons for vets to continue playing. When vets and HC players leave, game starts to die. Also, just imagine every player having 5 chak eggs, it would look like tokyo street fashion and everyone would be complaining that they cant see shit if more than two players stand near them.
---
That's kinda what makes it "easy". You spam everything you have because your defense (health, barriers) can only last for several seconds at most. The hard part is casting everything before you get killed/interrupted since you have no ways of avoiding getting picked on. So as I said, hard mechanically, but nothing to really think about - if it's off cd and enemy is near, you cast it.
---
Versus bad players/builds it works like a charm since those several seconds are enough to stomp everyone, but it's also easy to counter with ranged focus or just kiting out aoes/barriers.
---
You forgor complaining about every aspect of the meta.
---
Should work even with authenticator; Tested about a year ago, and there were no official changes.
---
Gen 2 collections are basically useless though since it‚Äôs cheaper to buy the precursor straight from the TP in most cases, and gen 2 legendaries (other than the first 4) are literally just gathering tons of mats, not very varied
---
You make Tyria a better place. Thank you soldier. o7
---
We can't really answer that for you I think, but to maximize your motivation in doing a task you would need task variety (do lots of different things), meaning and challenge in task (do something that tests your skill and you can improve on) and set yourself small but frequent goals (today I will get this much currency or mats etc).
---
I personally got fed up by fractals and mostly farm my gold solo or through WvW.
---
As a person who has never spent on the Gem Store, thank you for helping fund this game
---
Thanks, I sent in a report, hopefully this gets fixed overnight :)
---
I tried jumping all around and interacting with it but every time I do I get the same option: "leave" :(
---
That... Is an amazing site, thank you!
---
Cheaper =/= more fun
---
If you went for the cheapest way you wouldnt farm a single thing in the game, and just did gems to gold because IRL money is more time effecient.
---
happy cake day
---
Well here's the definition of it, lol.
---
Name-calling:
---
 **Name calling** is a form of verbal abuse in which insulting or demeaning labels.
---
Calling someone childishly, short-tempered and whiny isn't name-calling? I disagree.
---
Dungeons are a good starting point, but aren't too popular these days. Your best bet, assuming you've hit level 80 and are familiar with your class and build, is to watch some guides and then hop into tier 1 fractals of the mists.
---
Work your way up the tiers. Be willing to adapt. Accept when the mistakes were yours, and learn from them. Watch more guides. Practice your rotation. Find some guildies to show you the ropes if you can.
---
I love that you're continuing to be whiny and petulant, further proving my point. Delete this post. Neither it, nor your comments, are doing you any favors.
---
I just noticed the attribute bonus of necro signets does not apply to shroudmode while signet of suffering is equipped. It would be nice if that could be added when you update the next time.
---
Finally someone that gets it and dont cry for infusion after afking 1111 10 bosses. Well explained.
---
Yeah, I dont micromanage when getting gold usually.
---
If i remember correctly i know that the shoulder's and the gauntlets are heavy scale.
---
Where are the "Best Community ever!", "My first Legendary", "My first 100%Map!", and "My first Achievement!"?
---
Lol that's how the game is , you cant change the side it's on.
---
Feel free to use the auction house
---
I don't think you have to complete the event chain there to do it, but you can always try.
---
Also, make sure you do it with a character that has completed the story step that gives the Enormous Foxfire Cluster.
---
If nothing else works, you'll have to report a /bug
---
To get the Soul Stone you have to sacrifice your most powerful toon.
---
I wanted to make a meme, if you're not the type to enjoy this, your input isn't asked. So please, stop being contradictory and keep quiet.

Your input about the event wasn't asked, either. Literally no one asked you what you think about anything, and yet... here we are.
---
&gt; basically useless
---
I just wanted to give some nuance to this is all ^^ You're pretty much right though.
---
I did the collection for the legend, and the colossus and quite enjoyed both! Given i saved up most of what I needed before getting started though.
---
No its a very popular method and I usually see this advice in other threads. This used to be my primary gold method as well.
---
Yeah that would work too I'm sure, sorry I'm pretty sure I'm wrong about druid being there for might.  But I am correctly reporting what sc recommends:
---
https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/  (click on matthias)
---
They bring 2 alacrigades, who are not healers, and then a druid for healing.  I'm guessing the thought process is that a druid going healer is less dps loss than an alacrigade going healer.
---
My advice would be to get a cat flap.
---
You hardley need to farm to get the warclaw. 
---
if you raid all you say is need 2 mins brb. I have the same with my dog or if I need to pee. A raid group should expect you to forget life for 2 hours..
---
My first char was guardian and I played mostly solo PVE for several months at a time. I bought PoF and upgraded my guardian to firebrand and it's still my favorite class. Yes guardian is a support/tank character but I never had issues playing PVE alone. Just when you're doing group stuff going into LFG and find a squad. Also make sure you are geared properly to suit your play style. I was geared tank for a long time and I changed to condition damage and it took me some time to get used to having less health. have fun! :)
---
Thank you a lot, this seems like a really good set up! I just didn't really know how to go about it at all!
---
The Freshwater Pearl farm was amazing during the [April 20, 2018 bonus weekend](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/april-20-guild-wars-2-weekend-bonus/).  It was before glyphs came out, and you were able to get over 100% strike chance with the boosters and weekend bonus.
---
Same way LoL and similar do.
---
When so much cosmetic is locked behind money, people spend a bit here and there that adds up.
---
Over the years I spent 100s on lol, and probably have spent 200+ (including the expansions) on gw2.
---
Yeah, true. I suppose something is always better than nothing ^-^
---
War Eternal comes out May 14. I'm NA and still not super familiar with how the time differences work. When will War Eternal be available to me on NA? Will it be May 14 at server reset?
---
There is no easy-only-water one. Ele is quite hard to make good use and you want to cycle between elements. Skill cooldowns are huge by design so that you rotate elements.
---
I'll actually encourage you to DO cycle because of boon giving when changing elements. This might sound stupid, but the changes are instant and can be made during ~some casts. This allows you to build a water 5, for example, while switching to earth and giving protection at the same time you apply regen and remove conditions.
---
Try cycling. Is you want to supp, you will mainly water, but see what your current boss needs as a side buff. In bosses with great need for tank mobility, such as Vale Guardian, keeping your tank with acceleration uptime is very useful, so air. Might is always welcome as well, and so is protection/reflection, so fire and earth are always good - try to see what your other supp provides and fill in the blank boons. Just, be -very- cautious about reflection as it usually might break a required strategy with an unsolicited buff so speak it with your team beforehand.
---
I live in an flat where I'm not supposed to have cats üòã I would probably get a lot more sleep at night if I had a cat flap
---
Hi, 
---
I would love to try a condition based ranged (like 900+ range, not 450) character in small scale WvW. Something with a lot of mobility that could harass small groups of enemy and still being able to disengage if they turn on me.   
---
Easy to learn would be nice too. I already play Soulbeast for solo roaming and Backline Herald for zerging. Maybe something similar to Soulbeast but could sacrifice a bit of range for more mobility and condition based in stead of power.
---
Any ideas?
---
I try and make a new pun each week.
---
I'm definitely repeating puns at this point, but it entertains me for the few minutes I spend playing that character.
---
are pro league teams a joke? I honestly have no idea. I just saw some tournaments online with skilled players called "pro league finals" or something like that. All of them had revs on their squad.
---
I don't know if I agree with the second part. mesmers come to mind to my amateur brain. low skilled mesmers I can take down in like 5 seconds, but I've seen and encountered plenty of high skilled mesmers steamroll through anyone
---
Ah ok, that makes sense. Maybe that's the reason -- what I'm seeing is just outdated. thanks
---
Their comp is not up-to-date.
---
To get the Soul you have to sacrifice your most prized legendary to the Mystic Forge

I'm just gonna drop [one of my comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bn65n0/i_just_introduced_my_boyfriend_to_guild_wars_2/en3vnjv/) I left under another post here, it will help you with inventory management during the game.
---
Except for the whole 'swap weapons from inventory to spam mobility skills to keep up with fucking mounts' thing. That's pretty fucking annoying.
---
Healer Tempest builds fall pretty neatly into 2 categories, which is why you are reading a lot of conflicting information in this very thread. 
---
The build most people associate with healer tempest is a full Magi, staff camping "hard carry" build that shits out so much healing and has so much ressing power it can carry bad groups into getting clears - but provides very little to no boons. It'll look [something like this.](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQFAWn0XCtMgtNAOYCcYiFVAjIAsASiFLxIQGwNrGWTrA-jxxGQBtRHQtU+5RlgKS9HAcBAI3DAYI7PAA-e) 
---
The benefits of this build is that it is ridiculously easy to play and you can pretty much be at 90% efficiency camping water attunement autoattacking and pressing F on downed allies.
---
Alternatively, you can focus on providing most of the offensive boons druid provides (quite a lot of it 10-man, especially might and fury) and condi cleanse out your ass at a severe cost to your healing output. Not that it'll make you a bad healer, it just means you're not the hard carry build mentioned previously anymore. It'll look [something like this.](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQJBIhdSfJ0fJWhJ4gJwhJWEAM3W7rN3GEAmAHAiuwW4IA-jxhXQB66BAgQlfAY/B6pHIUnAgGqE0fq/AA-e) Note that any time you don't need the 10 man shout effect from Tempestuous Aria you can trait for Invigorating Torrents instead for basically perma vigor on your sub at the cost of having significantly slower might stacking speed. 
---
This build instead demands that you be able to execute a relatively strict rotation since it'll be the source of **both your boons and your healing**, being able to create auras to heal allies and go through your fire/earth overloads for might and prot respectively while dancing into water between them for healing. 
---
Recently there's been more groups willing to accept an "off healer" role for raids which tempest comfortably slots into.
---
Thanks for pointing - I'll think how this problem could be resolved.
---
I'm still upset at how my necromancer treated Joko (praise him)  when he was in the cage. He was instrumental in preventing nightfall and isn't entirely bad. Sure he broke the Sunspears, which I disagree with, but beyond war tactics, he pretty much left the civilians alone while they lived. My necro guy would probably be more interesting in talking with him, instead of that childlike taunting I did. 
---
Joko knows aura of the lich, which would have been a useful thing to learn, but newp..
---
It goes the same way as Warframe does it (which is completely free even) Where people enjoy the game so much they are willing to pay more for stuff like cosmetics from time to time, games like ESO just do it wrong.
---
And Blizzard simply is greedy.
---
You're viewing the game through rose-tinted goggles because it's all fresh to you. (I'm currently doing the same with XIV)
---
Fractals are not raids, they're more akin to dungeons with a hint of XIV deep dungeon. There's not 100 of them, there's 20, at different difficulties and they're not all relevant. Once you reach Tier 4 fractals (76-100) you basically never need to do the low level fractals again. And of the 20 unique ones you will only do 3 random ones daily (+2 CMs)
---
Of the 20 unique fractals 2 of them have "challenge modes" which is basically the fractal endgame and they're amazing and they kept me playing for a long time to push speed kills and stuff. But ultimately two years and no sign of a new challenge mode, and I believe devs saying they'll never make any more, really sours the interest to continue.
---
As you get more to grips with the gameplay and meet and team of competent players the game will become less messy.
---
First off, since you said you're kinda good at farming gold, that's what I would do. Farm gold, buy more character slots until you have every class atleast once. These tips are for PvP btw. but can be used in different game modes.
---
Once you have all your characters at lvl 80 (you can use tomes of knowledge to speed up some of the process, but don't do it to lvl from 1-80 immediately).
---
Then, check out which classes are meta right now. There's certain streams that do PvP only and you will hear stuff like "oh man, fuck warriors" or "aww cmon, another blood rezz from the necro"
---
That way you will know some of the classes you will meet in PvP.
---
Choose those classes to farm more gold (yes, this is an extremely slow process but from how I interpreted your personality, mechanical skill etc. to be, it's the least painful one).
---
Alternate between the classes and their elite specs that you see in PvP. That way you will see how the spells work (is it point and click, is it an AoE you have to place, is it a selfcast that gives me an aura).
---
This should help you atleast know the grapical effects that you will encounter in PvP (I know, PvP builds differ from PvE and WvW builds but this is literally to just get a hang/a feel/a tactile feedback on the class).
---
Activate Effect LOD, this will limit the eyecancer you get when there's more players.
---
WATCH PVP STREAMERS! Most notably those who play your class. Someone posted the GW2 twitch directory. Just watch them play and try to find out why they use certain skills (stun breaks, blocks, etc.)
---
Ask them in their chat. With all the amount of information, you can then start venturing into PvP (for other readers, I know this might not be the most optimal way, it's kinda more of a tailored way for OP).
---
Put the F-keys via the keyconfig in the game to other buttons that you are more comfortable with from other games. That's why I asked about your mouse and keyboard. I have most my utility skills 6-0 on my mouse, as well as F5 and some others.
---
Last but not least, do not be discouraged. If you're feeling like you're not improving, just go back to stuff you like. At the end of the day, it's a game you play for fun. Do what you like most. Explore the world on characters that you want to use in PvP, switch up abilities, read up on guides, watch streamers. The game is not just the game itself, but all the stuff around it too.
---
try contacting support. I was able to get a replacement dragon after having accidentally deleted it and i think all they did was check that i had sms verification on and send me another one
---
Okay, makes sense I guess
---
I always switch them up, and never really do key puns. One of my most recent ones was called Foot Footfoot
---
A very expensive filter. Consider:
---
Compare a long list of items to another long list of unlocked items, and determine if EACH item on list one is not on list two.
---
In SQL, that would be considered very expensive, and in GW2's object-oriented database I'm sure it is impossibly expensive.
---
Thanks for sharing! Great content! 11/10 would read again!
---
In all seriousness, as much as I agree, this will change nothing. People who don't use the search bar will not see this. All is vain.
---
Alright that is not for me :p thanks alot !!!
---
oh look, a low effort post. What a great contribution to this subreddit!
---
no stop don't make me cry
---
&gt;I also use nvidia freeplay which lowers my fps.
---
Do you mean shadowplay or freestyle? never really heard of freeplay.
---
Animation wouldn't prevent any action.
---
I can't sleep some nights, so I put on a podcast and farm Auric Basin or the Silver Wastes.
---
They just kill off the other ones to make room.
---
it's basically a outdated browser running in the game.
---
Thanks ! I'v heard people saying that there is big difference between bad and good Warrior!
---
Also had soulbeast in mind but think if people evade the pewpew bow you're done
---
Ah yes, the Scavenger's Chasm.
---
Rev quickbrand groups are still new or straight up not welcome in lots of pug I joined. Even random damage dealers I have to pick up once in a while straight up post "lol" in chat an leave.  
---
Healing necro might be problematic sometimes, but others will allow you to play one. For Ele it is the same.
---
For fractals rev quickbrand groups are a lot more common. Not druid healers with a chrono are also here and there.
---
I often switch from druid to tempest if the group can‚Äôt stay alive. Especially for sirens reef and Twilight Oasis
---
You seem to be stuck in 2015
---
Tomorrow's patch will most likely be very focused on story with not really much balance in it (give or take a few bug fixes). So most of the work would have been done by tomorrow even if some bug fix/minor change changes something to a skill.
---
It's hard to calculate the actual time as you have to use some of the wait time or you might not get in the good instances.
---
The event has been a good test though I feel it's current iteration has just been a bit "meh". If we took the "chase" rewards out, I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't have bothered. Would be interesting to see a graph of the infusion drops at the end of the event.
---
While you say most people have been happy with this event. From what I've seen it's just been rather mediocre. If you already did worldbosses it's a good boost but a majority of other areas of the game are still more rewarding.
---
World boss zerg's, champion trains in POF, World Completion, HP trains in HoT are just some that come to mind.  Low level fractals are pretty undemanding and can be done quickly.
---
You can rest now.

What are the current available scripts/programs for handling multiple account logins?
---
I miss those AI NPCs, they were my closest friends in GW1.
---
Perfect, thanks for your help!
---
It's more about effort invested rather than time. It took very little effort to get these.
---
gw1 veteran here...combat itself is way worse in gw1. system may not be the best from the best in gw2, but its not too bad. alone the fight feeling in gw2 makes the game more enjoyable...since thats what you do for most of the time. gw1 is just outdated...changing there that you need to stand on cast or making the animations more fluid wouldn't be too bad, but i guess that will never happen in gw1 anymore.

Guild Wars 2 monetization isn't that great, it's just that WoW's is astronomically overpriced and has been since day 1, which is why Guild Wars exists at all. I wish I could find the old articles from anet about their vision for Guild Wars 1, but part of it was that they didn't want people to have to constantly pay just to be able to play.
---
In what world does anyone think that $180 per year *plus* $40 per expansion is appropriate for a video game? This one, apparently.
---
Ah yes, the Domain of Winds.
---
Pugs can be reluctant to take these "off heals" in because some fights still favor 2 druid setups. Other than that i believe scourge is the most popular off heal, though not by a huge margin. Whatever profession you stick with, best also learn a dps build for that class to still get the 2 druid encounters.
---
Bring me Kralkatorrik !
---
*Swings the new Stormbreaker legendary axe
---
Mirage is the only one that fits, but it has less than 900 range on most skills. Other alternative would be scourge, but it's not mobile at all.
---
Besides scourge there's no ranged condi builds that perform well. You can also try something with soulbeast. Shortbow and pets can be used at range.
---
You can use the Sinister prefix until you get your Viper gear. Keep in mind: Sinister is by no means a substitute for Viper since it simply doesn't have condi duration. But Sinister will most certainly will be a good alternative until you get your Viper's gear, especially in open world.
---
Here's my advice to you since I've been playing both on and off as content comes and goes.
---
Remember that this isn't wow, there's no sitting still and casting in this game, you're very mobile, and will always want to keep on your toes.
---
The core game (1-79) is way, WAY different than the level 80 content. From the expansions and living story, things become way more refined, like in that you actually get tells when something's about to cast an aoe. You actually get difficult gameplay with raids and fractals. The core gameplay is a poor representative of how the game has changed because most of that content is still from 2012.
---
This game isn't nearly as old as Wow, so it has a lot less QoL. There really isn't a grand LFG system where you can auto queue into a LFR or a dungeon, you have to search on lists and join in on people already running-- or about to run the content, and you have to know where to look for these groups on the group system.
---
There really aren't levels of content here in this game.. there's no normal, heroic and mythic, there's just.. the content. For instance, I'd rate raids as basically starting at the heroic level of difficulty with bosses ranging up a bit to mythic level, or down a bit to normal. Otherwise you hit the ground running.
---
If you're used to running Mythic plus, consider trying to get into fractals. It's a bit annoying because you'll need a full set of ascended gear to do the top tier stuff, but it's kind of the same concept in a way.
---
The progression is different here. You can get a set of gear at lvl 80 that will be the last set of gear you'll ever wear, because this game doesn't release higher tier sets.. they just release new visuals (which I love) and new stat combinations that you may want to swap to, but that doesn't happen all too often because of berserker/vipers meta.
---
There is but there isn't tank/healer/dps roles. It's.. complicated, in a way that you can probably run a full team of dps with skilled players and be fine, but having a team with a designated healer is good too. Almost every class can be any spec for it usually just depends on gear, and armor class doesn't mean too much. Obviously you won't see like a healing thief or warrior, but really every other class can find some sorta niche in a support role of healing or giving useful boons. More now than ever designated "buff supports" are way important in fractals and raids, more important than healers in most cases, because they make all the dps that much stronger.
---
A big part of this game's combat relies on its boons. Having 25 stacks of might is 750 power/condi damage, which most builds base if you're going for it cap out at like 2500 power or 1500 condi, so that's almost a 3rd of your build in power, or HALF in condi damage. People underestimate how important it actually is, and if you're playing a class built to give those boons, people will love you.
---
As with wow, just find a group to do stuff with. Honestly, I still play wow only because I have friends to run M+ with. If I could convince half of them to come play gw2 with me, we'd be raiding and fractaling every day as well, having people to play this game with will make or break it for you. Guilds are a good option to step into, just look at who you're playing with when you do content, socialize and you'll find yourself getting invites quicker than not. People are generally super friendly here, and having 5 guild slots makes it easy to get all your limbs caught in a doorway.

I think the best known one is the [launchbuddy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bf2ltg/gw2_launchbuddy_19_release_place_in_position/), there were some other scripts too, but I can't remember the names, guess they can be found somwhere in this subreddit.
---
Tl;dr: get friends who enjoy the game and play with them 
---
I think not having any (irl) friends playing this game really takes a toll on me... now I only play the story cus, I love the game, but i just cant be bothered to play it outside of the story because my irl buddies always ask me to play other games (with them)
---
The main difference between Other MMOs and  GW is that in endgame the progression is in yourself rather than your character. In WoW, the endgame is a gear treadmill where progression comes from better statted gear. In runescape, progression comes from leveling up your character for better stats. In GW, the progression is YOU becoming better at the game. This does a few things, it allows new players to catch up more easily, but it also keeps old content more exciting.
---
On their website it says that the information in raid comp doesn't apply to the April 23 balance patch.  So I think your right.  Either way, we both agree a heal thief is currently considered meta by sc, so the first guy's concerns about running thief are unfounded.
---
Pve/pvp use mega servers, so it's just EU and NA. Actual server (world) matters only in wvw game mode and being "good" depends on what you want to do in there.
---
When do you use Necros Shroud effectively? When you are low on health?
---
For raids:
---
Alacrity renegade (heal or dps), Quickness firebrand (heal or dps),  Might dps tempest are all good. You can find the builds on snowcrow's site.
---
Necromancer support is great only for squads that are in the process of learning the boss. Once you are able to kill the boss it is useless waste of class slot. Any of the three above are more optimal.
---
For fractals: you either don't run any healers (firebrigade comp with dps firebrand giving quickness and dps renegade giving alacrity) or you go with chrono+druid comp. However, for regular T4s, quickness heal firebrand provides the most utility and support via aegis/stability/protection share as well as most important quickness.
---
Yeah, I hope they do too.  I personally never expected to get any of the rarest rewards (I just enjoyed the event as an excuse to finally complete the Mistward Armor and Tyrian Service Medal achievements) but I've been really surprised at how little the TP prices seem to have moved.  A few of the infusions dipped when the event was announced, presumably by people selling in anticipation of a price drop, but they quickly recovered, and have held steady for the duration of the event.  I didn't expect a glut of infusions to suddenly flood the TP, but it's a bit depressing that they were apparently *so* rare that they didn't even move the needle on the TP.
---
Don't know anything about any "hidden" skins. I was allways finding what I was looking for.
---
Ye
---
I just did the full route I got 136 mussels, 9 pieces of mother-of-pearl, and 0 freshwater pearls. That's worth 20s and 64c (assuming the mussels even sell). Based on my results and what others have said, I think that one's time would better be spent by farming gold for the freshwater pearls (assuming that those are needed). Anyway, thank you for sharing this!
---
Just a minor thing that I noticed: At Bonestrand Waypoint, there are two paths, but there is no distinction between the two to indicate which should be done first. I didn't even notice this until I got to the end of the first path and found that I needed to teleport back to the waypoint from which I just came.
---
Another minor thing that I noticed: In some areas, there are green paths that closely align. If not paying full attention (which can often be the case while mindlessly farming), it can be easy to accidentally get side-tracked onto the wrong route. This is usually something that can be quickly caught, but I think that maybe some extra colors (or patterns (for colorblind players)) could be useful.
---
Thank you for everything that you do!
---
Thanks!
---
This one bothers me the most. Swampland would be *so* much easier if people just brought one stunbreak because god forbid that they lose out on a little dps.
---
Siren‚Äôs reef and Twilight oasis wouldn‚Äôt be a problem either if people brought reflects and blinds but NOPE, need that big dick dps!
---
1. Very. Game is massively different without it. No mounts no gliders sucks. No rush to get the expansions until you reach level 80 on at least one character, but do keep in mind it's temporarily on sale for 50% off right now.
---
2. Yup still pretty active. World Bosses are almost always at least 1 map instance full. Dungeons have decent LFG as long as you play during prime time for your server. 
---
3. Watch some clips, find a build you like on metabattle.com, make a new character and try the builds out in sPvP for free (after getting the expansions), or try the builds out in the 80-boost free trial.  
---
4. You're missing out on some exclusive content and achievements, but it's not a huge loss. These game modes aren't that rewarding. If you want to learn, find a build that sounds interesting on metabattle.com, watch some clips using that build, try it out in the sPvP arena, then play some unranked. For WvW builds, you don't really have an option to try it out in WvW before you commit, so watch videos and try the build out in sPvP to compensate.
---
Holy shit I love this thread.
---
Thanks Rhves, this was the answer i was looking for. Mostly i will be doing open world map stuff,and dungeons but did want to see if i could get into some,entry lvl,raiding without having the full accessory set for Vipers. Thanks for letting me know Rhves and TueriElda!
---
Depends.  What is fun to you?
---
I'd recommend just playing what is fun for you because almost everything gives you money.  And if you play for fun, that's the best way to really enjoy the game. :)
---
waa waa waa TIL.
---
Wbs are fun for me but the rewards are underwhelming :/
---
... I have that same screenshot!
---
If you're going to build something, than yeah seriously wait a month or two until Ryzen 3000 series is out. Prices on 2000 will most likely drop and if you can afford it 3000 will be around 15% bump in performance (and possibly more in single core performance).
---
/r/buildapc  and /r/buildapcsales are great resources to check out when building a PC.
---
With GW2 Your #1 goal will be clock speed. GW2 barely uses extra cores so the single core clock speed is the most important. Any mid range or higher GPU made in the last 3-5 years will handle the game just fine. GW2 is insanely more CPU intensive over GPU.
---
Or find a guild/Discord server that you like that wants to do stuff, or post your own LFGs with "casual run" or whatever in the title. I don't have any real life friends who play GW2 (consistently) either and I still make decent gold because I'm part of a raid Discord that constantly needs people to fill in for their statics. MMOs (especially GW2) are pretty much designed for socializing and finding your online "tribe".
---
You got a game for 6 years. That's nothing?
---
right: Anime
---
left: Netflix adaptation.
---
I'll disagree, u/odonkz.  For what he's looking to do, the Ryzen 2xxx series are on sale (just picked up a 2600x for a song, new).
---
Given he's not looking to play high end FPS titles at 144hz and 60+ FPS on ultra, there's no need to wait for now (esp given the old system he's using).
---
I just ordered all the parts for a mini-itx system - thermaltake v1 case, msi b450i mb, 16gb ddr4-3000 mem, gtx 1660 ti, 650w ps, 480gb m.2 2280 ssd, ryzen 5 2600x proc, all for less than $1k total (closer to 850ish), and that system will last me for years.
---
/u/kf4zht \- if you want to future proof, build the ryzen 5 2600 system (reference my rough parts list above - can go to [www.pcpartpicker.com](https://www.pcpartpicker.com) to put things together for your needs).  If you want to go with bigger sizes, you can get atx/itx/microitx stuff cheaper than mini-.
---
Free accounts have [restrictions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Free_accounts) that you don't.
---
You get an [exclusive outfit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Royal_Guard_Outfit) and [birthday presents](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Gift) from your old characters.
---
You haven't been playing anyway so why does it matter now?
---
The question is how much are you willing to spend for a new pc/laptop. If u can give a price then people can easily come up with ideas for a rig that is budget friendly and can run GW2 smoothly.
---
The cheapest all-around build that i can find is using the Ryzen 2400G. It's got decent clock speed 3.6-3.9, it has the best intergrated GPU in the market, decent stock cooler and costs around 100$ depending on your country. So u just save around 200-300$ cause you dont have to buy a GPU and u can just buy one when you feel like it is needed. It will run GW2 easy on medium settings with good fps and it will run all new titles easily as well. The compromise is that u won't be able to play at max graphics, 1440p etc etc. But overall it is the cheapest u can buy with some future proofing since it already runs on 8 cores, (4 cores,2 threads per core).
---
Another thing about ryzen is that the 2400g,2600(both editions) and the upcoming ryzen 3 series, all use the same socket (AM4) so you can upgrade whenever you want without having to buy a motherboard all over again. You should probably go with 450 motherboard series as they offer overclocking and they are fully compatible with the current and the next generation of CPU's.
---
The ryzen 5 2600 (x or not) is a much better CPU and really good for the future as well but you will have to spend the extra money for a GPU. If u want to buy a GPU then i would recommend 2 choices for 1080p 60-75fps. If you wanna spend the extra money then the 1660ti. If u wanna cut costs then go with rx580-590.
---
The already popular GPU's  1050,1060,1070 are just overshadowed by other products and they dont offer the best performance per dollar atm due to inflated prices (mining).
---
Gw2 is very cpu dependant and mostly on a single core. So you want a cpu with really good single core performance. The ryzen 5 1400 might give you similar 30 to 35 fps on lowest and upgrading to ryzen 5 2600 will only gain you another 30% performance. In fps on lowest settings would be anouther 10 fps. Ryzen usually does less in gw2 than intel mostly because of single core speeds. Id research those who have ryzen and play gw2. Theres lots of vids on youtube to check out performance benchmarks.
---
Veruta is also known as Strap-on Sally.
---
Here's how I think about it.
---
While you level a character, you gain character-specific XP to earn levels, and you also earn character-specific HP to train skills.
---
Mastery is account-wide.  Like XP, Mastery is an experience bar.  You choose what you wish to work towards, and once you gain enough Mastery (experience) while that goal is active, it unlocks the goal. 
---
However, there are also Mastery Points.  Once your mastery goal is unlocked, you need to "purchase" it with the MPs.
---
---  
---
I have several alts whose stories I'm currently going through.  Once I hit 80 on one, I realized that it was an account-wide mechanic, and that it would be better for me if all of my characters were 80 so they all work towards the mastery goals.
---
Mystic forge conduit in to the mystic forge? Risky recursion, but ok
---
There really isn't a good alternative for use in raids (the only place you'd use full Vipers is raids).  You lose a lot of damage not having Vipers Trinkets.  Trinkets add a lot more to your stats than armor or weapons.  I would just get your Vipers trinkets and use another class in the meantime.
---
It was a different system I forget what it was called. You can still see it in some story missions I believe.
---
Next time I'll just have someone describe the film to me. That way I don't even have to waste my money on a television. Genius!
---
They don't get the hair, but def the beard option. I think he chose norn cause it Norn is too big , and bulky. And the other human male bodies are too fat.
---
Nice work.
---
I've been wondering if it would be possible to have an AR calculator that also adds the stats it affects to the total?
---
 Speaking again from Pve, you don't really need it on renegade. In any organized content there is enough swiftness going around and if ur solo (and playing renegade and have pof) u can just use your mount for any travel needs. 
---
Renegade plays in a way that mobility doesn't really benefit the build and if u truly need it you can run shiro for your legend instead of kalla while still using the renegade trait line and upkeep impossible odds (net -1 energy per second in pve).
---
On top of that in any instance you're not getting swiftness from another source mallyx/shiro condi is probably better than kalla/mallyx  condi anyways.
---
Are thrash mobs NPCs that are into a particular sub-genre of metal?
---
Thank you
---
Where do you think the Crystals on those armor sets came from ;D
---
Genuinely thrilled that the tier1 set looks like simple armor.  More of that please anet!
---
Most trains are run on weekends, it's harder to find them on weekdays. 
---
A [streamer I watch](www.twitch.tv/harlequinpet) runs these Tuesdays as well, which might help you avoid waiting another week.
---
Gw1 combat &gt; gw2 combat.
---
Been playing bot since release 30k hours into gw1 and 10k into gw2. Everything is better in gw1, so speak for yourself.
---
I'm sure that there are people who are very excited to get these.
---
Now I want to wear armor made of Mordremoth's corpses. Arah armor somewhat fits after Zhaitan.
---
where do you see buttcapes ?
---
For me, WvW and Fractals are incredible money makers. Take advantage of events such as World Boss Rushes and such. Completing the story also gives out a bunch of things, and it has nice replayability value through Achievements.
---
Yes. 70 gold seems like a lot, but only running some of the HoT metas once a day and doing nothing else, I already earned that much within just the last week. It's even faster if you do other stuff to, like silverwastes, Istan once a day, fractals, etc.
---
And you get a lot of benefit out of ascended trinkets, even just getting bitterfrost frontier can be super helpful
---
What is fun depends on your preferences so you have asked a question that can't be answered by other people.
---
I just do a little of everything.
---
Was more just my 2 cents than advice. It's what I've been having fun as. I'm not doing competitive raiding so I don't really care about maximizing my damage to the point of playing something I have less fun at. 
---
In fractals I'd like to think they bring pretty good cleave and support through cc/banners yeah, never gonna beat out those scourges though.
---
I'm in the same boat as you.  Longtime WoW player, tried GW2 6 years ago and recently started playing again about a month ago.  My absolute favorite thing about this game is I don't feel forced to login to complete my dailies or do my daily chores.  I'm not forced to do anything.  I set my own goals, login when I feel like it and still feel like I'm progressing.  I don't have free time like I did back in my WoW raiding days so this is perfect for me.
---
Only need Skill, and a portal to the Mists.
---
"Kralkatorik, I have come to bargain."
---
They existed well before that.
---
They were made specifically for dungeons as a harder version of veterans, so much they were initially called "Dungeon Veterans" internally. Then they called them "Lieutenants", then "Elites" caught on.
---
In open world you would only see a couple of them them in a couple of corners in Fireheart Rise, until Season 1 events brought in some elite watchwork enemies in open world.  
---
If I recall correctly, they started replacing excess champions with elites sometime around the Tower of Nightmares release.
---
&gt; Elites have almost as much health and armor as champions and sometimes will hit even harder,
---
and they are all immune to most forms of CC ... =_=
---
&gt; or i have something in change?
---
Yes, like 3 years of fun and entertainment before the base game went f2p. If that is not enough, sue them.
---
The dungeon elites were around before champ bags existed.

I feel like I'd be much better at the game if I didn't visually lose my cursor during busy fights. Is there a way to make the cursor easier to see ?

Ah yes, The Grove.

Fractal dailys
---
Arah P1-4 + AC P1-3 + aether path
---
If you have Siren's Landing then you also have access to the back items as well from each of the heart vendors.
---
BFF also has the ascended breather ... if you are one of those people &gt;_&gt;
---
Character, you probably lost those gifts, but double check just to be sure.
---
Nah. Don't bother. Sinister is either as expensive or more expensive than viper.
---
It's better to just use anything with condition damage like the cheap exotic Carrion or Rampager trinkets from renown hearts, karma vendors, WvW badge of honor vendors or crafting, and go straight for Viper ascended.
---
Daddy likes keys
---
Yes. Bitterfrost frontier is the easiest/fastest way to get trinkets and make some extra gold. Especially if you do the very run on multiple characters everyday.
---
On all of those, and on 90% of ANets armors because they're embarrassed of the walking animation or something.
---
I agree with the other poster.  Use the box, see if you actually like the VIP areas.  I felt the same way "everything's just right there in LA!" but Mistlock has been an awesome quality of life improvement I didn't know I wanted.  It led to a purchase from me. 
---
The "best" ones are Mistlock (if you do a lot of fractals) or Armistice (if you do a lot of WvW) as both return you to wherever you left from.  The others are margianally less convenient.
---
Upgraded medium has them it looks like
---
That may be innate immunities, if they do not have Stability, Defiance or a Breakbar.
---
For example, Risen abominations are immune to ensnaring conditions and all CC except Launch. Rooted enemies like wurms are immune to any CC that forces movement, but not stun, daze or knockdown.
---
They do event for free and paid players. I do hope they reconsider for this idea though.
---
Yeah, should have listed budget. 
---
The PC I was looking at is $400, and I can probably get it down a few bucks. $30-40 for a ram stick and I'm good. 
---
Pricing out a R5 2600 with what I need and assuming reuse of some parts its around $550. 
---
I'm not going to spend over $600. I have a pretty hard rule about not buying technology and usually raid the scrap bin at work when I need a PC. Already breaking that rule here. Really past $500 and I have a hard time not using that money to buy something that is more of an investment.
---
I hope there was an awkward pause before you said "Your mother, for example."
---
i think the biggest issue here is you playing tempest in fractals, especially healing one. if you wanna protect your party use the focus skill on air. also props for making the right decision and going reaper, bye
---
I disagree he would look to muscular then. And the shoulder armor would still look disappointing on the norn.
---
That wasn't even me and my heart broke watching it.
---
One little note about Banner stats being reflected in the stats window while it is on your utility bar for Warrior: it's a great perk, but there are cases where the stats are being factored into calculations in the editors stat panel where they are not factored in-game. For example, equipping Banner of Discipline and selecting Furious Sharpening Stone will show higher values for Power/Ferocity than you would actually have given that exact set-up in-game.
---
Thats (574 boxes / 4 bosses per hour) /  7 days = 20h/d of world bosses. How much multi loot?
---
F
---
I OC my 8700K to 5.1 GHZ, 32gb ram 3600 mhz but I cannot get 70 FPS in wvw with medium setting. I don't believe you can get up to 70 fps in zerg. In normal wvw, I can get up to 80-100 fps, but 25-30 fps only during huge fight
---
Basic sets look OK. Sets with spiky growths on them look rubbish.
---
Godhood has its perks indeed, thiccness eternal :P
---
I wonder if there is someone else who opened that 575th chest and got infusion üòÄ
---
It has a lot of functions. It adds extra defence and utility. It really depends on the situation. Sometimes you want to use it as an extra helathbar sometimes you just wanna use one or 2 skills. In some situations you want to stick in it for the full duration.
---
I salute your efforts, good sir.  o7
---
....why a video??
---
I R Key Farmer. Sometimes Ertrty.
---
I‚Äôd love it!!
---
Edit: will send a screenshot showing account isn‚Äôt PoF
---
I think those are added but the different is small anyway.
---
Yeah Rev have possible traits that give high % Outgoing Healing (2x 20% + 15% + ~33%) plus gears you can easilly get over 100%.
---
Honestly for the first day or two all threads should be manually approved by the mods to avoid people being dicks.
---
Ah, yes, the salvation pass
---
Damn it who is cutting onions around here?! Great vid btw can't wait for the new episode!
---
No you bought the game and Anet made a free trial. But you know if you want to feel entitled fill your boots.
---
I, too, laughed out loud
---
Just one word, my  friend: **cauliflower**.
---
I was doing patriarch the other day and got hit with inactivity while tossing eggs. While funny sometimes the inactivity shit doenst make sense.
---
whats the music called from this preview ?
---
Tell your team to not be bad and jump the balls. The title is exclusive and is not designed to get carried through by 1 person. If you need a carry just use cpc it doesn't kill your mates.
---
charr are really just furries with two boners
---
I need a 10 hours loop of that piano track. I'm usually very critical of Anet's work, both in terms of music and writing and I like to have contrasted opinions, but I also tip my hat when something is done well.
---
Druid only has spirits and spotter. Tempest and Druid can both stack might and fury. The Druid unique buffs are great, but pretty minor in fractals, but admittedly very useful in raids (hence why you usually still want one if you don‚Äôt have soul beasts‚Äîbut can easily swap tempest if you have one). 
---
Tempests biggest str in my opinion is actually earth war horn 4, which can really help out chronos or firebrands attempting to keep up quickness. That is a massive buff and the closer you can get it to perm the better your group will do. Great fb and ch can get pretty high uptime, but most players won‚Äôt, and an extra 6 seconds (skill and triggering the gm trait) go a long way.
---
Really wish that the bonus from this event wasn't RNG based, but was instead currency based. It was hard to want to take part in this every day, knowing that I likely wouldn't have got much for it
---
And ofc there's buttcapes and weird flaps... Can't we have some tight pants and biker jacket leather armor already :'(

Just park all alts on bottom heart with dummy targets. Way more time efficient than even map completion.
---
I was told that too. However, it was a PR flack , not a dev. And I was in position to test it shortly after. And it isn't true. The xp is wasted.

Holy hell, thanks for the writeup! &lt;3

That statement was made by a PR flack , not a dev. I was in position to test it shortly after. It is incorrect. The xp is wasted.

Found a group of friends to run Fractal CM's, T4's and Recommends just about every day. Make an ungodly sum of money that way.
---
Outside of that, any typical method of digging up gold can be fun with a few varied builds.

More pants and simple symmetric armor, what a bizarre concept!

Geared a heal alacrigade couple months ago and it is the only character i am using in endgame content. Totally in love with it.
---
The package of the class is so fun and diverse, you mostly have a skill for any situation, the only other class i can think of that brings that much utility is the mesmer.

Requiem Armor Mk II babiez, this time gonna cost yu around 60 Runes of the Scholar.

So, I'm a newbie. While leveling the other day, an "event" popped up in the area to kill Awakened champions. I did the event, got some level 78-80 loot, and soon after got a letter in my mail from an NPC to go and talk about the monsters I fought. 
---
I was curious, so I looked them up on the Wiki, but closed out as soon as I saw the disclaimer that the article had spoilers for PoF and LS4 (it's my first character, only level 17).
---
Is it safe for me to follow the letter and go talk to the NPC, or will they be spoiling the expansion story/talking about stuff I'm not supposed to know about yet? I would hope not since this event happened in a low level area, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.
---
Yeah, I rebought it because it's on sale but it'll be a few days before I can install it. I played a little bit when heart of thorns came out but that account is long lost for me.
---
Almost the same experience here. Played quick/heal brand and now switched to mainly alacrity/heal renegade. I do found that renegade could be a little bit better at direct healing with its tablet skill natural harmony (5-7k aorta heal with no CD), strong heal skill as renegade and the elite skill, which you can just put it down and auto attack and heal. Perma alacrity and might can be provided by simply spamming F1 and F3, and everyone has the pink aurora and will thank you for support. 
---
Support firebrand, on the other hand, provides extremely large amounts of protective booms, protection, regen, Argis, and perma fury, might and quickness.  But most of its skills has a aoe range of a 1/3 pie-shaped triangle area in front of you, and could be tricky sometime to heal a pug team when they don‚Äôt stick together as much. Its healing ability is less consistent, but higher burst imo (long cool down tome skills) which I don‚Äôt really like. But quickness has overall 25% effect better than alacrity so I would say it can be more useful in terms of providing boons.
---
The biggest suprise while playing alacrnade, and the main reason I prefer it, is it‚Äôs insane break bar. Renegade has a summoned skill that constantly breaks bar when put down, and your staff 5 can commonly break any bar within second. 
---
I haven‚Äôt tried chrome and Druid yet, but alacnade +quickbrand is considered a superior combination these days.
---
[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/K3hbbX](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/K3hbbX) This is a basic but future-proof build using the ryzen 2400g with stock cooler. The pricing goes at about 550$ but can go down with some tweaking like going for 8gb ram instead of 16 or slower ram or no [s](https://ssd.You)sd. You could go with cheaper power supply since this build doesnt need much power. The motherboard should always be good, a crappy motherboard will give you a lot of problems in the long run especially when upgrading hardware. So always stick with a good motherboard. The case fans are pretty basic but they are crucial, 3 in front, 1 in the back.
---
You can already see that a build with 2600 will go way higher, almost 800$, unless you use old parts to fill in the gaps.
---
The base version should hopefully be a scavenger hunt and achievements, if the version 1 of Jahai's armor is any reference. 
---
The upgraded version, however, will be a grind fest for sure.
---
Any chance y'all could link to a build for these two setups? I'd like to get more into quickbrand but I'm not sure where to start.
---
Thanks for the great breakdown!

Living World Season 3 is worth it for the maps and the story along side the maps with easier to get trinkets. I enjoyed Living world Season 3's story which acted as a very good precursor to Path of Fire. Also you get to see something you will be aww struck by near the end of the story. Though the maps (other than bitterfrost and lake doric) tend to have low population they are quite unique to themselves and act as a bridge between Heart of Thorns, Central Tyria and Path of Fire. They are all very mount friendly without being a difficult endeavor if you do not have mounts.
---
Two blues and a green.
---
...Who said it was ending here?
---
They have already said that next next Bonus Weekend Event will be focused on Meta Events which means again world bosses &amp; expansion metas. Players will be able to claim rewards from the same meta multiple times during one day. And they also announced an update to PoF metas.
---
At least you got a whole lot of ecto's :) ectos bout to be like 2 silvers now.
---
Love the videos, some of the songs tho...
---
Well, I shouldn't be surprised, given the number of folks I've stumbled on ERPing in this game.

Is that a question or a statement?
---
 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
You're forgetting fire overload. Fire overload pulses might to 10 targets both while channeling and continues to pulse if u finish channeling it for 30s duration (@100% BD) per pulse. You then apply all of that *again* with heart sync on 10 targets. 
---
Reminder were not talking staff here. And Condi might tempest uses the same thing to produce its might. I don't think you quite understand support ele builds. 
---
Most of the healing on a d/wh or sc/wh build is from elemental bastion. As long as u have auras u have good healing. 
---
The point of the build is stacking boons from auras and might from overloading fire which is where your fury, swiftness, regen, protection, and optionally vigour comes from. 
---
Even with that you mostly camp in water until fire comes back off CD to re might stack and u can save wh water 4 and wh air 4 for hard cc.
---
Now with GoE gone its basically equal to ele in terms of boons and utility, with d/wh ele having superior healing where druid has spirits and spotter.
---
one must go further and open 1000 boxes. Only then will you get 2 more extra powerful bloods.
---
Do you have your Mystic Curios because 4 Chest of Legendary Shards Only, won't cut it! But good progress.
---
&gt;Same weak bonus cache
---
The bonus cache isn't bad at all, especially if you get it from each bounty. The lottery ticket and mat aside, you always get a rare unid per chest. Compared to world bosses loot, it's an ~35% increase. 
---
But for bounties it would be like 80% increase? Since you only get a champion bag each bounty. And since you can do bounties way faster, it would be hundreds of rare unids per day per player. Not weak at all. 
---
However, I would like to see the same kind of event for bounties, no matter if it's the same cache or an other additional rewards. Bounties need better rewards, such an event would help (temporary). But let's see if they include bounties to the PoF meta event improvements.
---
Can I delete collection items/trophies from my inventory?
---
Is there any use for Ascended armor drops I don‚Äôt need?
---
just get mist trinkets or raid trinkets (:

---
Convert the berries into unbound magic and buy Magic-Warped bundles. It's kind of gambling, but i always seem to come out on top with them.
---
what is with the "dust mask" look that is on every other set of medium armor.
---
If you check, I acknowledged Fire Overload directly as an even less reliable source of Might. You're locked out of it for a bit when you first go into Fire as well as losing most of your Might stacking tools for a decent chunk of time afterwards if you want to use other forms of utility afterwards.
---
Bastion is cool, but remember that if you're conserving your shouts/Auras for healing then your Might stacks are going to be even less reliable. You also don't offer Vigor+Regen on Auras unless you choose to not take the trait for extra Might on Shouts, making your Might stacking (and team dps) noticeably worse.
---
I play a LOT of Support Tempest: mostly Raids, but experienced with PvP, as well as some WvW and Fractals play, so I do understand Ele Support. I also wasn't mentioning Staff, I was assuming a Sc/Wh build in an effort to maximise potential Might sharing, but even with that assumption it's lackluster on a healing setup.
---
I'm totally open to off-meta stuff and I readily accept evidence; if you can show me logs of 5-man content where an Ele was relied upon as the main source of healing+Might/Fury and provided both as adequetly as a Druid can, I would immediately retract my points made above. I don't believe this criteria is unreasonable, considering the claim being made is 
---
&gt;Now with GoE gone [Druid is] basically equal to ele in terms of boons and utility...
---
Hah, I hadn't thought of it that way...I wouldn't have two copper to rub together if I were aware of how many 'cheap' skins I didn't have yet.
---
Ah...  
---
  
---
More come, yes?
---
sweet thanks, i always just hoard the berries.
---
too ez
---
if people could get it through tokens then the price would tank making them not a rare thing to get. they learnt this lesson with previous things which then makes that reward feel shitty because guess what its now worthless.
---
Hey man you do you.  Just want to make people aware of their options.
---
&gt;if people could get it through tokens then the price would tank making them not a rare thing to get.
---
That's not a bad thing. 
---
Them being a lottery for some random person to get 4000 gold, while thousands of other players waste thousands of hours, is a bad thing.
---
Thanks for the answer! 
---
I'm not trying (and probably never will) to flip high end items. I'm talking about the 100-1000g range. 
---
I'm hoping to profit on no stock items placing various orders and hoping to be the lucky one to buy them. Technically i'm losing nothing placing orders, and if i'm lucky to receive one and immediately relisting it at not so crazy profit it should sell fast, right?
---
Eh? Maybe the dyes are just bad but looks eh to me.
---
The spikes just bring the whole thing down also.
---
good 5man groups can burst down any bounty (except legendaries) down in seconds and even the legendaries go down pretty fast.
---
The only place something comes quickly in this game.
---
I desperately want the non-upgraded medium gloves. But I hate the rest. They didn't show the boots, so I might like those as well.
---
Open Task Manager and check the following:
---
- Check if another application is eating your CPU usage (e.g. Windows Defender)
---
- Check the CPU speed and make sure it's not throttling down. This could be a heat-related issue.
---
Ah, yes. The Eye of Kormir.
---
I play heal tempest all the time in raids and I love it! The auras are nice in that they can't be stripped like boons, and in encounters like Slothasor you can trait for a 10 man stunbreak via eye of the storm to take less pressure off a druid. It's got quite a few options via Condi clear or quick ressing, though a heal scourge is still king of quick resses imo. Very nice alternative option for that game mode or open world content.
---
[Alacragade](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vlAQJAWinnNWMTyJvmRNlZzsoytZ4UZ3MIs8bmFglaNAOgG4v+2vAk9C2gQA-jxxGQB3UXwSV+RunAQQV/BAXCAoqEUI7PAA-e) \- I run this with a bit more zealots to balance out the fact that you get extra boon duration in fractals. The meta might swap some talents here and there but I think it's pretty close. You can do middle on the last renegade trait if you want more might generation and less alacrity, like when you have a chrono in town.
---
[Support Firebrand](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNApeWnsADFBjtDBmCBEEhlHCbvemPDoYBgGQW66XdlWAA-jhxGQB0T9HAcKAmoSQy9EA9BDZ/BCq8DA-e) \- This is pretty close to what I run, save for taking legendary lore and the signet elite for more healing, I think I might try this my next run to see how good the quickness uptime is! Regardless, it's about getting cooldown on your books, pumping as much aegis as you can and having a grand ol' time just moonwalking through mechanics. Obviously this is more for fractals as well, I don't think you'd want minstrels in raids unless you ARE gonna tank, even then you'd be better off doing like 1400 toughness and harriers..
---
Actually the absolute number was around 7.6 million in June 2018 but I get your point. I agree that one person working multiple jobs is one person too many. But at the same time it's important to accurately convey statistics like this because it makes us look dumb if we don't. Saying "many of us" looks exaggerated to any reader that isn't familiar with US economic data and can be misleading. Statistics are meaningless if they aren't contextualized
---
You won't be able to get into some groups. Pugs want druids.
---
Big yikes.
---
&gt; Saying "many of us" looks exaggerated to any reader that isn't familiar with US economic data and can be misleading. Statistics are meaningless if they aren't contextualized
---
That‚Äôs a fair point. It is important to contextualize.  Kind of why I latched on to the 5% number since out of context from the population size it sounds like a handful, when it means 1 out of every 20.
---
I‚Äôd call 1 out of 20 ‚Äúmany‚Äù but that also doesn‚Äôt mean the next person will, and thus why as you demonstrate in your comment both numbers and context paint the clearer picture.
---
Well, having major spoilable things in GW2 (other than the one death in the main story) is a fairly new problem, so the community is already used to the lack of restriction. Changing direction on that would be a titanic undertaking.
---
Apparently at least 3 people do (unless it's all been the same person posting), since I've seen him pop up 3 times in the last week or so.

I think most people would be perfectly happy getting a challenge here, but it's not a challenge when you're just relying on luck and rng, it's just tedious and disheartening.
---
People didn't like spending countless hours upon hours doing the same exact content just to be shafted by the gods of probability. I know I'm not alone in thinking that a better way to get rewards would have been a token system, making each boss drop a token, and make ultra rare rewards cost a lot of tokens.

Btw site seems to be under heavy pressure right now
---
I hate to tell Anet but Australia isn't a European country.
---
What weird pugs you have! In mine (cms) people DO NOT want druid chrono, FB+ren (with either healing) makes runs way easier.
---
I still can't believe you renamed REZ to Joy's Special Children. Pre/post-patch really fucked a lot of groups (inc ours)
---
So i can unlock the story on one of my LVL 80 and still play it on the ones im lvling right now when they get LVL 80?
---
You would have to pay to unlock past Living World Episodes. Once you've unlocked them, you can start them at any time without doing Personal Story.
---
100000% sure that male versions of all armour type would be totally not so "naked" as female types =\_\_\_=
---
Oh man.. I feel so heart broken.. I'm glad I stopped at 20 boxes.
---
I mean the Chakk egg is worth literally more than TP can handle, I think it's enough of a reason to let it drop few k gold?
---
Yes I think with the I troduction of mounts we will see more skins come to the game. Mounts allow people to flex harder because they can be cooler and more flashy and they'll receive less backlash then selling armor I'm sure.
---
you where multi-boxing this?
---
idk i think multiloot would have been easier and normally still gives 2-3 chest
---
Aight, suppose i'll give F2P a go and see where i go from there then. Thanks
---
That doesn't make any damn sense lol.. the chest gives shards not the materials to make the shards...
---
I got the exotic Crustacea twice (~50 g TP), and a lower level exotic worth about 6-8 gold on tp.  That's in "maybe" 200 boxes or so.
---
Play order doesn't really matter unless you care about the story. I meant the purchase priority LWS3&gt; LWS4.
---
Always "Yo I Like Keys"
---
Good luck, and hope to see you in game. Feel free to ask lots more questions in these weekly threads.
---
\*cries in Finnish\*
---
It was still called Defiance, but it wasn't a bar, just stacks of a buff.  The boss would ignore all soft CC, and hard CC would take off a stack of the buff.  When it had no stacks of the buff left, the next incoming CC would actually work to full effect, then the stacks would all return.
---
Have you seen the recipe conversion? You use the shards you craft in the mystic forge to make the chests smart ass. It allows you to pick shards at a lesser cost of mithril and wood by converting 100 1h shards to a chest worth 75 of the new GS ones.
---
It's also known as a metaphor
---
But that's what we are :^)
---
Wrong archers. The ones I am referring to are in the corridor that you drop down slightly then go through followed by another drop then you fight the knight assuming it is the right path. Nothing resembling a bubble anywhere near them.
---
Yes, but every character is independent, so progress in the story on one character will not change progress for another, but the purchase itself is account bound
---
Same. Even the chance it doesn't look like trash on my male human daredevil ill take.
---
Apparently because he is known to no life wow that means his opinion matters for every other mmo in existence.
---
You can't plant them but since you can get them from harvesting the Orchids around the world; the first vendor will exchange 5 seeds for 1 posy.
---
You buy the chest from a laurel vendor bro what are you talking about LMAO. we playing the same game right?
---
Problem is, Aurene is a unique Elder Dragon. What if you fail to carve that Aurene Saphire out of her tail and can't craft the full set?
---
The spoilers will be reasonably minor, and probably won't mean anything to you for a long time.  Technically, the existence of the Awakened champions in your newbie zone was already a spoiler of some things to happen.  But given that you likely have no idea what the Awakened are, the effects of the spoilers are minor.
---
With that said, the mechanical effect of talking to the NPC is starting a fetch quest to gather some items in exchange for a tool that'll tell you what zone the next Awakened champions event will be happening in.  Unless you really enjoyed that event and want to seek it out more often, you're safe to avoid talking to the NPC until you get past the Path of Fire storyline and through LS4 Episode 1.
---
Thats not what he initially said though. Oof
---
Then there is the new player. Got GW2 a week ago. Stumbled across a random world boss. Gets a chak amulet. And sells it at a random vendor.
---
Thanks for the link dude to show this goomba xD
---
no
---
But yes, we are playing the same game, maybe learn the niche's while you're at it o/
---
they only have to delete the gold to gems conversion and they will make much more money.
---
Well we needed to buy the expac to get them
---
We needed to buy the expac for the seasons tho
---
But not the actual Seasons with Single Player Missions, new maps/gear and group content
---
He‚Äôs sayin that the shards to make exordium are in those 4 Enormous chest of shards which can be made using 400 offhand shards (not one handed, a small correction) 
---
If you do this then you‚Äôll save a lot of mithril and elderwood
---
\*cries in swiss*
---
I wouldn't even take those crapsets for free.
---
Will do :)
---
Define 'challenge.'
---
Define 'reward.'
---
For some people, grinding out the dailies is a challenge. For others, raids are a challenge. For others, simply logging in and playing is a challenge - but that is more a life challenge than a game one.
---
For some people, skins are a reward. For others, achievement points. For others, the thrill of victory.
---
This is why people need to be careful when using generalizations. Sure, it may apply to one group of player but not all of them.
---
I guess, made this thread longer than it needed to be.
---
I opened 470 and got all common drops, except for like 5 uncommon. And none were the breathers lol.
---
At least I know I never have to do this event ever again I suppose.
---
technically, no. We get them for free as long as we log in during their release period... BUT we need the respective expansions to access them.
---
thank god i didnt waste my time on this
---
Yea thats mad confusing lol . Same icon different name. Cause those little chest only give like 1 - 2 shards right?
---
I'm sure this has been asked countless times before, but since you mentioned it i figured i'd just ask your opinion. You say that leveling is pretty easy and it gets harder towards the endgame/expansion content, but how hard exactly is endgame stuff? just moderately harder than the leveling process or is certain stuff actually challenging?  
---
I realize this is a bit of a subjective thing but that's alright, mostly just looking for the opinion of someone who's tried it.
---
But it is what is in the picture provided by the OP. Double oof
---
True, but that is all expansion content at the same time. Would they charge per episode for the season or per season? If it is per season, just call it an expansion(or the first episode an expansion and the rest of them season x). If it is per episode, people will feel like they are being nickled and dimed.
---
So, either way, not a good idea.
---
But the picture shares the same icon as the laurel vendor. Oof
---
You have been abandoned by RNG god from the Mist ...
---
I like how braham prepared an intervention speech. I wonder how many spelling errors are on it. Shit now I cant unsee braham as Charlie from always sunny hahaha
---
Invisible Boots cost like 2800g-4000g. If you could get them with only 100 World Boss kills, that's like getting an extra 28g-40g per World Boss kill. They're *supposed* to be prestige items.
---
*cries in infinity*
---
Don't, it's a trap!
---
they wouldn't be special anymore if there are worth 100g after some days :)
---
Assuming i can get into the combat portion of the game, this sounds like something I'd love.
---
I liked my Turtle Beach headset, it just broke after 8 months of use.
---
They cost 4000g, because the drop rate is low. I am saying that having RNG low drop rate is poor game design, and having a currency system that allows any player who chooses to engage in the content is a better system. I am purposefully suggesting that they shouldn't be rare.
---
I remember they said sth about bonus meta events in the future, bounty would be nice too, sometimes I feel like some of them are completely abandoned unless you run into map/maps trains.
---
no.
---
So essentially you want Invisible Boots to be cheaper at which point you might as well buy them from the TP rather than grinding 100 World Bosses.
---
I don't think that them being 'special' by being rare RNG drop is a good design - at least not as a reward for a bonus time gated event.
---
But you wouldn't be able to carve out a tail if you get that gem, unless you get that from reward
---
You run into a similar problem because if you jump into a map instance which has just had all its legendary boards cleared by another group you'll have to wait \~20minutes for them to respawn or try and taxi to a fresh instance (GW1 districts when?).
---
If you don't care about Legendary vs Champion bounties then I suppose it's not as big of an issue, but I can still see people playing wack-a-mole at the bounty board trying to pick them up as the spawn, and being disappointed when another group putting it on cooldown.
---
I really wish Anet would move away from so much RNG with their content.  I don't mind grinding for something, but gambling my time away with an extremely high likelihood is difficult to get excited about.  Made it pretty hard to get hyped regarding this event.
---
No, I want ArenaNet to design weekly events that feel rewarding. I want to be able to see an event and think, "if I play X hours a day, I'll reach my goal of obtaining Y".
---
Instead, there was an event where I thought two things. I thought, "if I do this event non stop, I will likely walk away with nothing - and less gold than if I had just done istan etc.". I also thought, "if I do anything other than this time-gated event, I lower my chances of obtaining this rare item". It simultaneously made me want to play it non stop and to do anything else. What's worse is that it didn't make both options feel great, it made both options feel terrible and like I was wasting time. Ultimately, I didn't even log in most of the week and played a different game instead.

Yeah, but they are likely the same type of enemy unit. So they have the same immunity even thought they got it because it was needed for when they are in a different place.
---
Requiem appearance comes only through skin consumables, they're not actual pieces of gear maybe that's what OP meant?
---
I don't have HoT, I have PoF though.
---
Should I just do PoF after my personal/vanilla stuff ?
---
I'm still working on my first legendary, but 1-3 ranked PvP matches a day, plonking about in LS4 maps and maybe doing an Istan or Silverwastes run is a very good way of just ending up with some gold. If you throw in some T4s, you're even better off. 
---
Just playing the game is very rewarding gold-wise, as long as you'd constantly challenging yourself/
---
No longer than a week typically. Might be a bit rough because of the episode tomorrow though, but you're ahead of that mess so it's all good.
---
Wait for the ticket. Seems rough and not the answer you want, but customer support should fix you up.
---
Maybe it's the 2080ti you don't have.  I used to have a 1080ti and the fps is no where near the same.
---
Easily remedied by looking it up on the wiki, learning that and trusting the OP is on point with pre-planning. Yikes.
---
Look at this guy, having legendaries.
---
Only enjoying Renegate, I had love/hate relationship with revenant  
---
(made character to 80 played, deleted made again and got all professions)  
---
and only liked it with renegate, why you ask, mostly because at least I "feel"  
---
like having more dps and it fit me if I play solo, or join random open world metas,  
---
somehow I love the fire mechanisms of professions and use of short bow, not too long  
---
not too short distance but I don't have to stand in face of anything,  
---
also I guess I'm biased since my revenant is Charr so connecting with Kalla  
---
and visual skills with Charrs fit it a lot and give me a sense of being part of immortal warband xD
---
Thank you! :)
---
I do find similarities between the two skins due to their white glows and sleekness of their designs. Considering that Pharus is pretty much 80% white glow I would say that is an important similarity.
---
Regardless, I don't see any point in making a quotation like that. Its not a response to anything in here and just brings over what others have said in previous threads. 
---
I mean is it not enough for those comments to be downvoted to hell in those threads (simply for making an observation), do we really need to post them in every Pharus thread to mock them? How about simply liking the weapon without stepping on other opinions?
---
No reason not to. It's like starting a TV show on it's third or fourth season - there are established characters and there's a plot going on that won't make sense for a a few moments, but then it picks up on its own.
---
[Spoiler](#s 'You're hunting down a god for trying to break the universe. You're also trying to break the universe a little bit, but you've got a backup plan so it's all okay.')
---
I doubt we will need LS currencies.
---
This is a side effect of almost everything being tradeable / purchasable for gold.  
---
Edit: And yeah, I think exclusive content for each map/area/farm is a good idea.
---
Thank you! Maybe I should finish LWS4
---
And to clarify, your suspicions are correct, they usually aren't in on weekends. Expect it in the next few days, very likely before the sale is over.
---
And if not, mention in your ticket you're after the sale, anet will typically hook ya up.
---
Why wouldn't we? We needed them for Aurora. Anet is pretty predictable
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

Makes me feel bad for constantly smashing them

Lol at the pitiful amount of T6s.
---
Good to know! And yeah! I mentioned the sale.
---
It‚Äôs a fun timing thing, I was just telling co-workers that being a commander in WvW was the most fun I‚Äôd ever had in PvP and hours later I got the email about the sale and went ‚Äúwell why not.‚Äù LoL.
---
Thank you!
---
Did that a year and half ago. Crushes me to this day.
---
Yes, 2 screens, 8 accounts (4 per screen)...and still maintaining 15-20fps during the events.
---
The game is not as badly optimized as some would make it sound. Can it be better?!...by all means...yes, but it's not that bad.
---
It puts a lot of stress on the computer, and I judged the poor return to not be worth it at all. I'm better off doing my normal stuff for about 15-20 min/day and making over 800g/week.
---
Heart rate 500 bpm.
---
What does this even mean? And is this not against the rules?
---
I was always a fan of different upgrades for one armor design. Glad it made its way i to gw2 and exceeded my expectation
---
Sounds more and more like the kinda stuff i love.
---
Wow. Disappointing. Not sure how else I'd feel about that, except we know the odds were against us for the good loot. I opened about half that and didn't get anything worth noting. I don't think anyone in all my guilds did either, or not that they mentioned anyway. And they're were always people asking.
---
GW2's architecture strikes me as a leaky ship made of duct tape and goodwill. Anything that involved would probably require a total teardown and rebuild, and that just isn't happening.
---
1. There will always be some. A lot more prevalent in sPvP, maybe some in Raid/Fractals. WvW doesn't really have that many toxic people, but they do have people that won't shut up in team chat so you'll have to block them anyway. Generally though, the community is super friendly as there's no situations that would promote competition outside of pvp game modes. You get exp for reviving players, all loot is shared, everyone gets equal rewards in events, so it doesn't promote petty competition in general game play. 
---
2. Not really. The things you can buy: a) Quality of Life items b) Cosmetics c) Gold. Basically you're paying to look good or to not grind as much. Paying won't help you AT ALL in sPvP, maybe a tiiiiiiny bit in WvW, Raids, Fractals (paying for best in slot gear and food).  
---
3. Servers don't matter outside of WvW. You just pick NA or EU. For WvW server rankings, check https://leaderboards.guildwars2.com/en/na/wvw  
---
4. Warrior is good in raids and fractals and dungeons, but its best role is a support. Not saying it can't DPS, because power Berserker and condi Berserker can put out some great numbers, but if you want pure DPS, there are better options. For more details, check  www.snowcrows.com for Raid builds, www.discretize.eu for Fractal builds, and www.metabattle.com for all other builds.
---
What are you doing here Red Skull
---
Considering we get this question multiple times a day I'd say the population is pretty healthy.
---
It's so worth seeing your dumbass stink up the place, how about you try pvp?
---
Gw2 uses megaservers so everyone in EU (and NA respectively) can play pve and pvp regardless of world (server) you choose, those matter only for wvw and each server has its own communities, guilds and playstyles.
---
Right, will do, ty

What about the millions of others he's killed? You're being kind of overdramatic.
---
Was scrolling fast and read I Peniley Crapped Phallus.
---
Yeah.... I don‚Äôt know what their obsession is with asymmetrical spiky shit all over armor. Another reason about being excited to get past the Kralk plot. Less reasons to put crystals on everything.
---
Alright thanks!
---
Ah, yes. I'm proud of when reddit unites under the one Banner of Strength.
---
Thank you, Commander (;
---
If they were for sale for a currency that required killing 100 world bosses their price would crash down to the 10ish gold range within a matter of month.
---
Items need extreme rarity or to be extreme material sinks to maintain a prestigious price point.  There are plenty of grindy items in the game that act the way you suggest.  There is a need for both.
---
Where is your might coming from with the Dagger? Are you just hard relying on double Chrono for SoI spam?
---
It's acceptable. Most boss kills are gated to daily, and this is the case here also. Kill FE 5 times with multiloot and you only get one daily killl reward. You get 5 bonus boxes though because they're not gates to per-day. It had to be intentional.
---
Anet has mechanics, like Grand chests only opening for you on one AB map of you multiloot. So anywhere you can, it's fair game.
---
I read somewhere we need 12,which makes sense because we have the mount.
---
They uploaded the new SAB track from this year, but still forgot about "Loading..." (the level loading screen music).
---
After the amount of community complaints they had with the 250g for the 5th mount. There will never be another mount for a big amount of liquid gold. 
---
Personally I think there will be a collection similar to the beetle one and I don‚Äôt think it will involve more then 20 gold (excluding potential crafting mats).
---
Okay but why bring up in this thread where noone said anything like that?
---
Saving this post for when I start to make it a year found now.
---
Still takes about 6 hours of scrambling after mounted zergs, or roming around and getting run over by enemy mounted zergs. Not everyone has a stack of reward track pots sitting around.

yes it's dead

WHAT YEAR IS IT??
---
He grinded 14 hours a day and this is why this event was a problem. To maximize your chances you have to grind your ass off. I would prefer a daily cap but increase how many boxes you get per boss. Over the last week its been pretty miserable to grind this event. I like my events to be fun, not a 24/7 farm.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to find out the crystals can be dyed and somehow legendary armor still can‚Äôt.

I see pieces of the medium and light I want to use but I really don‚Äôt like those helms.

This is build version, not player count. Arena net does not publish reliable player count data.
---
1. Fractals are a special type of "dungeons" that scale (not infinitely, but they get pretty hard). It's one of the two types of end game PvE content, the other being Raids.  
---
2. Mesmers have certain builds that output tremendous dps in PvE, especially Raids. Power Chronomancer and Condition Mirage being the 2 dps builds. However, they are not the top dps across the board. Different Raid encounters have different top DPS builds, check www.snowcrows.com to see which encounters favor which. And DPS Mesmer builds are rarer in Fractals.
---
the community is complaining about everything. it's too expensive. there is no content. nothing to do. it takes too long. ...

Ah then I misunderstood it.

That would be pretty nice if they released one.

Hi! If you keep an eye out on LFG --&gt; Open World --&gt; VB/AB/TD, there's almost always an HP train that runs through there. I myself will be continuing my map completion trains starting next month, since I'll be settled into my new place by then :]
---
Other than that, I don't know of any commanders that run on a set schedule :/
---
1-7 days usually, business days of course. It can take longer if there's a high volume, but that's the likely scenario.
---
I really like Exordium, I've never been interested in a legendary before. Seems impossible. Good luck and enjoy it!
---
Uhh, magnetic aura works fine for Arkk's balls. Are you sure you have the aura sharing trait Powerful Aura equipped? If you have Powerful Aura and reflect the balls, they still will leave a visual red circle on the ground, but it will be a friendly effect and hurt Arkk instead of hurting your team.

I am not really sure why there is a need for items like this, but I also think it's particularly poor to attach this sort of rarity to time-limited events.

It's real... Of course it's real: rule 34.

Aurene didn't start it. Kralk did when he attacked Glint and left a massive Brand Scar down half of Ascalon all the way to the Crystal Desert.

You could ask support for a refund of the mats.  They help out with this sort of thing.
---
&gt; probably the best fight they've done in the series.
---
Certainly the *longest* fight, anyway. I walked out of that thing with every piece of my armor shattered. I just couldn't quite move out of his attacks in time; I'd always be a step or two too short.

Didnt have anything there ? Is there a prerequisite ?

And that's how I tested it. I tested it both in Central Tyria and PoF. I sat at maxed bars without enough MPs to finish for weeks , on CT , and for over a month in POF. Spirit shards are easy to get and I would have accumulated a good number in that time. After I finished those , I got no shards. In both cases. 
---
So , it's a miscommunication , or a feature that was intended but not implemented , or it's bugged.

If you are in a position to test it, feel free.

I see a fair amount of Berserkers since the recent patch. Where are you mainly? Vanilla zones (Frostgorge, Cursed Shore) are probably going to be sparse because most players have the expansions. Istan and HoT maps are going to be really populated as that is where a majority of the farming is done. Plus I see a lot in Fractals as well.
---
Didn‚Äôt see that so wasn‚Äôt sure. Good there was some sort of official word on it. 
---
Not that it gives you much extra chance, as this video shows.
---
I think OP meant what Kralk did to Aurene, when he talked about "the unspeakable". And therefore, yes Aurene started it. 
---
But for Glint it's the same, she should be his scion, but she got corrupted, allied with other races and helped them to fight the elder dragons. Kralk just went to punish his creature for the betrayal. 
---
And the brand, it's just a side effect of his being. It's not like he branded everything on his way on purpose. It's just like when you step on a bug while walking. 
---
Kralk never started to attack anyone, like Zhaitan or Mordremoth did. He always first was attacked or betrayed. And he was attacked and betrayed only because of his natural behavior. Only because some races don't like how the world works.
---
Kralk did nothing worng (actually he really didn't).
---
Right I mean my point was they probably wanted to gather data on the event before committing but do plan to actually put SOMETHING in place for these events other than ridiculously heavy RNG
---

If you want a little setup to GW2 I like the movement of the world as a kind of quick lore setup (wooden potatoes has a [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g35ug27Iz34) [part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4c02x0h2U4) series on it). If you prefer to read it you can do that [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Movement_of_the_World). He also has a [playlist on the lore](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL00553A085339802C) if you want a more general overview. If you want to just read the story summaries the [wiki has sections on them](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Story_summary) and I have a shorter [recap on them](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Story_Recap) (mainly season 1). As for what your story is I'd need to know your race and starting choice for the level 10, 20, and 30 story sections, 40, 50, and 60 will depend on your order selection. If you said what race, starting story choice (can look up your starting choices under "H" &gt; story journal), and order choice I could give you a quick recap.
