Hi guys. I quit gw2 ages ago, I am not entirely sure how far back but it was before the game went f2p but after HoT release. 
---

---
Soo I am playing gw2 again and I’ve done the intro quests for the flames expansion but I’m kinda lost and I am not entirely sure what should I focus on... I’ve done a few quests and bits and pieces of the main story. 
---
What would you recommend doing? I’m not interested in pvp but I love pve and dungeons/raids and also open world content.
---

It's completely up to you if you buy one or both! It's a nice 'free' system so be it. It doesn't increase the level cap as such, but you'll unlock the specific specs and mastery system of that expansion as well as furthering the story. Each expansion also has a raid you'll unlock. 
---
May I ask, what level are you in the base game?

They usually run in conjunction with EVOS now, I think.
---
Back to PvE with it, as it should be.
---
No, we don't.
---
[removed]
---
You need an amulet, rings, and trinkets as well. Just realize that even for your level, you did this under geared.
---
I recommend using the trading post.  Blue jewelry can be used and then resold on the TP.
---
It wasn't a skill, he dodged, here's the dpsreport screenshot

---
Catch up on the stories, if you've not gone through HoT, do that. Go through PoF and do the story / get your mounts. If you care about continuity do the story bits in order, you may want to consider picking up any living story you missed through the gemstore (remember that gold -&gt; gems is an option). 
---
Get your masteries to a comfortable level, for example, canyon jumping for raptor, high jump for springer, etc. Or go full ham and max them out.  
---
After that it's just a case of look through your achievements and see what looks fun and go do that. Maybe unlock some elite specs for your characters.
---
Pretty sure they're talking about the daily achievements. You get a set of four each of PVE, PVP, and WvW tasks -- doing _any_ three of those gets you 2G once per day.
---
Spirits lose health over time and dying more easily to environment than before. Nature spirit failing to ress downed people most of the time. And now pets are getting nerfed tomorrow, I don't see a point to try hard as a druid and hurt your fingers while FB and Rev just get the job done with a breeze and peace of mind. And seems like that's what Anet aims.
---
Lol better patches.
---
And please keep in mind that G2A is not the only "keyselle" who works this way. MMOGA, Kinguin and many more do exactly the same. 
---
If you don't know if your chosen website is one of these illegal keystores, you can check a few things to be sure. 
---
1. Ofcourse you should check the official GW2 retailers. It's actually not a check if your chosen website is illegal, but using official retailers gives you a guarantee to buy your game legal. 
---
2. Check the prizes. Illegal keystores sell almost all of their games on a huge discount with like 30-70% off. Since official retailers have 50% off on GW2 expansions too, check other games on your chosen website. If most of the games have huge discounts over a long time, it's a big hint that this website is an illegal keaystore. 
---
3. Check other services. Many illegal keystores sell ingame currency for different games too. If your chosen website sells WoW gold, Fifa Coins or other ingame currency, you can be absolutely sure it's an illegal keystore. Keep in mind that things like GW2 gem cards technically also are ingame currency selling, but not necessarily are illegal, since gem cards can be sold legally. For those things it's good to look at point 2 agains. If they sell a 20$ worth gem card for 10$, it's a hint for an illegal keystore. If that's the case, check their other services/prices. 
---
4. The legal notice. Here you can find all informations about the owner/company of the website. Not all countries have a legal notice duty, but it's common for serious websites to have it. If you can't find a legal notice, it should be suspicious. If you find a legal notice, check the address of the owner/company. Most illegal keystores indicate non-existant addresses, mostly in Hong Kong. If you google those addresses, google map will show you a place, but if you take a closer look, it's not the actual address. So if your chosen website don't have a legal notice or their address are in Hong Kong or similar "untouchable" countries, it's a hint that this website is an illegal keystore. 
---
If any of these points are the case, better use anoter website. Don't be seduces by big savings, for GW2 use official retailers and for other games only use trustful websites. It's the best for you and your new account.
---
How do i get reshade to work with this? When i press home the options menu/tutorial/etc work but it has no effects available to apply and won't recognise downloaded presets.
---
If you know how g2a works and don't buy from random sellers you have nothing to worry about, trust me.
---
The most recent expansion is widely believed to be a massive step back and a lot of systems in the game feel very unrewarding. This is due to a ridiculous amount of rng and not so good design.
---
wow..
---
*starts clapping*
---
They've managed to break just about every system they can from class gameplay to gearing, including things that people enjoyed prior to the latest expansion.
---
All while removing many quality of life features that no one asked to have removed, delivering patch after patch full of bugs, and pushing out half-finished features that were supposed to be selling points of the expansion.
---
The story is also considered to be one of the worst they've ever published.
---
Elementalist power tempest and power weaver (though they swap a few pieces for assassin to cap crit), power daredevil and power deadeye, power dragonhunter and power quickness firebrand (swaps a couple trinkets to diviner and runes but you can leave the runes the same).
---
&gt; your idea in a nutshell:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; 1)player joins, says they're good, they're trash so they get kicked
---
&gt; 2)cue waiting 5min for lfg for a new player to join
---
&gt; 3)another player joins and says they're good, yet surprise they aren't, get kicked
---
&gt; 4) wait another 5min for a new player to join
---
Excuse me, but where exactly did I say that? Because I never wrote something like that. Please don't put words in my mouth. 
---
However believe it or not, I experienced exactly these 4 steps in groups, but with 250/500+ LI and XY KP. The only difference was, that we waited 10-15 minute for a new player to join instead of 5. 
---
As a solution, how about *real* kill proofs? Maybe a title for 5, 50, 100 and 250 kills for each boss (could bee too much titley maybe) or something like an emote which automatically posts your amount of kills for a certain boss. Just like /age or /deaths but readable for everyone.
---
In wow? Basically Horde and Alliance were fighting side by side against the Sargeras, major enemy and his forces to prevent destruction of planet in previous expansion, Legion and somehow they ruined most of current expansion's story to create an excuse to start conflict between two factions with very lazy writing. 
---
In game mechanic wise. They released expansion in hurry and half developer stage. The features like new gear system is quite tedious and designed very very bad, its pure rng. 
---
They made class rotation so slow by adding global cooldown almost every skill. Several spesific specs are quite powerful while rest is kinda mediocre and people do not want those in dungeon runs.
---
Most of expansion selling points are literally  boring and grindfest without actual reward system. 
---
They promised, they would release one of races most people wanted at launch but 6 months later they barely released it.
---
Most of classes lost their uniqueness cuz of skill prunes and they just got rid off artifact weapons  which added/gave tons of skills we used to play for 2 years and they just didnt add back yo compensate it cuz of early release. 
---
Game was like in beta.
---
WoW just put 8.2 on PTR but it likely won't release until June/July. Most people either stopped playing already or aren't interested in coming back until 8.2 is live and they know it's actually decent.
---
I have not seen a single case where somebody had their account unbanned in this situation so far. 
---
If you don't buy from official retailers, you are willingly assuming the risk of the bad keys. Sure it doesn't happen that often, but when it does, it's nobody's fault except the person who didn't buy through an official channel.
---
Ohey
---
Warrior looks like it's going to get a strong power berserker build tomorrow, but we'll have to see 
---
And power weaver and power tempest are both strong viable power roles
---
Because private server are super legit and legal...
---
Might I suggest leaving the "#Sweden-physical" off of the end of the link to [approved retailers](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/). :)
---
Eu or na?
---
I just purchased from CD keys website. For 15 aud too!
---
Well getting the green plate for the treasure room is a sorta event in my eyes, and you cant get the deldrimore light when the daily timer is almost nearing its end
---
&gt; you have nothing to worry about, trust me.
---
sounds like something a scammer would say.
---
Commenting so I remember to join
---
Same here.. Every single case of G2A related issues have never returned in favor of the player.
---
GW2 more or less takes a zero sum approach when it comes to such areas and it's ...really not worth the risk...at all.
---
&gt; All that, and their PR is straight up bad. The head of community relations has called their players "dickbags" on his Twitter, the lead story designer has said they don't worry about criticism in their "dojo," and the boss of the WoW team has a really hard time being honest.
---
Funny, a general sense of disdain/disrespect toward their customers is what got me to stop playing Overwatch after the "Do you have phones?" thing. 
---
I really get the sense that the people who currently staff Blizzard hate the people who made them what they are. It's unfortunate, albeit not surprising. Blizzard's been a titan in the industry for decades, so it's only fair that this far in there's been enough turnover that the only people left in-charge are sharks looking for a quick meal.
---
As of right now we have NO IDEA what is going on over there, but a lot of talk is that it has nothing to do with NSCOFT ... this time
---
I googled it to refresh my memory and to save anyone else a google, morale boost. Often gained by killing a boss in open world.
---
Yeaaaah I did a dumb during the Anomaly phase where you island hop in the Skorvald fight and jumped before the little wispy launch thing appeared and fell to my death :V
---
lol...RNG...GW2 is built on rng
---
I know your face from my Dream
---
Aww, thanks man. It's good to know someone remembers her.
---
Honest Guild Warrior detected. :)
---
Good user.
---
That skill has a base damage of 458 and a coeficient of just 1.25.
---
Whatever combination of traits, foods, stats, skills and other effects allowed that measly skill to do that much damage,  you know it has to go.
---
Perhaps! I recall dueling a cute pink haired Asura DH in an arena and running into the same person in wvw once as well.
---
Hot damn some great replys to this! So it seems that druid is still in a good place from what it seems for my playstyle/role (s) I like to play.
---
Activision
---
It all began after the merge with activision, you could pinpoint 80% of the problems being resulted by them wanting to make more and more money of less work. 
---
Its a monthly subscription game already ffs
---
Did anet just fire a bunch of people that never looks good
---
Leveling is pretty fast in this game, and especially, not that eternal drag in the later levels, as in other MMO, since you need the same amount for each level. Also, depending on when you left, you might learn a lot, and then some about the game, and class, by leveling a new toon. 
---
That all said, I DID find it a bit cumbersome to do the story while leveling, because the chapters open up every 10 level, only until 80. And later I wanted to open up some maps, regardless of whether I was ready to go there story-wise. But then, I am one of those "oooh a butterfly..." kids, that get distracted at every corner. And then forget what happened before. 
---
TL;DR: I might actually do both. Leveling for learning the game again (depending on how long you were gone), and boosting a char to enjoy the story at the pace that suits me, best.
---
There's little to no RNG in *progression*, that's the thing.
---
What people talk about in regards to RNG in WoW is more of "To do Raid 2, you need a full set of Armor from Raid 1. However, the armor only has a 25% chance to drop, and all of your cloth DPS need the same armor, so you'll have to roll a dice on top of that 25% to get the one piece of your set, and also you can only do it once per week."
---
By the time you get to Raid 2, Raid 3 will be out and repeat.
---
I'm not 100% against all Gear Progression in every game, but WoW sometimes get's real shitty with it's gating. Disclosure: I never played the most recent expansion, but I have dumped 1000+ hours into the game over it's life. If it were just a matter of "Run Raid 1 6 times" then that is a different story.
---
I'd guess full zerker, merged with ferocity pet, 25 stacks of might, fury and sick 'em at least
---
All the God outfit should be shown from behind, since they ran away faster than Logan.
---
There *are* cases of Arenanet unbanning when you purchase a real, replacement key.
---
I don't know how consistent they are with it, and it's absolutely *100% better to assume they won't do this*, but it is a thing that has been done.
---
the 5% endurance bar not full is also decoupled however to staff master's current gain endurance for each initiative spent. considering 90 power (per infusions) is generally accepted as 2% damage, then 240 power would be about 5-6% and at least gives an actual choice. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Weakening Strikes is also getting a free 7% damage increase and being moved to minor so there's a chance that the staff mastery trait will encourage non auto attack chain usage in the first place and be more focused on initiative
---
That makes sense, I just find myself at like level 20 and it feels like im missing out by not being able to blaze through the story and get to the end game areas. Of course, I don't know how fun the hearts and such become later on, because as of now they are just "kill this, or press F on this!" and it's not very fun to me.
---
As a guard main, I highly suggest re-learnig playing Core Guard and leave DH for end game. DH is a very specialised dps build, which truly shines with the presence of support classes. 
---
In comparison Core Guard is versatile and self sufficient. It has more survivability and the fast paced play style is suitable for open world where easy mobs die quickly. 
---
For example, I prefer bringing core guard over DH for dungeon speed runs. Although DH deals more damage, I value the party buffs and utilities more (eg. Party wide quickness, on demand retal, stability, stunbreak, condi cleanse, swiftness etc), whilst not lagging behind DH dps much. 
---
Btw, there’s another interesting non meta guardian build: Power Quickbrand. I use this for Fractal Recs (lower T1-T3 fractals) to provide almost permanent quickness to party. I used to play Banner Slave Warrior as power dps, but have since switched to Power Quickbrand because numbers don’t lie. It’s esp useful if there’s no Chrono or support FB in the party. 
---
p.s. Core Guard is great in PvP.
---
Kormir is to cool for us.
---
They had a round of layoffs somewhat recently but from the information we got it looked like Anet was putting a significant amount of resources into "other project(s)" and that they're now entirely focused on GW2.  Terrible for those affected, but not the death of GW2 at all.  With their restructuring I'm optimistic about the future of the game.
---
My best suggestion with leveling is just skip hearts. They were really added in as an afterthought and don't add much to the game or experience. Your best exp while leveling is always going to be events and killing monsters that have lived a long time (up to ~235% bonus exp from killing them if they have been there a while). I'd also suggest picking up [some cheap food and utility](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Leveling) for more bonus exp.
---
Jade Quarry Bronze Squire critcially hits you for 11,645 using [[Worldly Impact]](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Worldly_Impact).
---
While those are both valid points, I meant that getting an equivalent of +240 power/5-6% increase with the endurance trait seems quite easy (with potential for a bigger increase). My assessment might be wrong but without testing this would be my best guess.
---
The 7% increase by weakening strikes only balances the loss of 7% increase while in 360 radius. I agree with what you said about Staff Mastery and hope that it will make Daredevil more interesting.
---
That's still an assumptions.
---
Beside, I was mostly answering to the "don't want do to them" part. Three and a half armor sets in a few months doesn't equate as not being interested in releasing armor sets anymore, especially since we've been used to receive them mostly with expansions before LS4.
---
You didn't say anything about that but you could just do PvP if you are tired of farming and meta events.
---
It's the same thing that allows thieves to pull off 16k Death's Judgements or warriors to pull off 22k burst attacks. Stacking damage multipliers has always been the way to do strong burst damage. One shot builds are dumb memes but they've been around for a long time and they're rooted in the core mechanics of the game not one or two broken effects.
---
T1 fractal crowd is very forgiving. The content is fun and easy enough (easier than dungeons IMO). Feel free to state that you’re new and if anyone has a problem with that, they’re the dicks. No one expects T1 players to know every encounter. 
---
Take it from me, since I play in a weird time zone (SEA), I pugged my way to the highest levels of fractals (challenge modes). 
---
As for dungeons, it’s important to say you’re new if you haven’t done it. This is because exp players tend to run/skip the OHKO mobs and when they’re aware that you’re new, they’ll keep an eye on you to teach or help with the skip. This is only applicable to the harder Explorable paths btw.
---
Thats true very every prof except for paragons. I made a lily white ginger one.
---
And now it's 6k subscribers? That's almost nobody lol
---
Make a new one then.
---
I've been using g2a to buy games for cheap and never had any problems at all.  
---
Maybe I'm lucky or maybe the illegal keys there are only few and most are not illegal. who knows.
---
I dont think it will be the trailer since we are getting a balance patch tomorrow, but I do think their will be another teaser, maybe even another current event.
---
It's a pack of (generally) buffs, with a pretty hefty downgrade of steal to swipe if you slot daredevil.
---
Reactions range from cautious optimism (mostly by players who like staff) to lol ded class is ded gg anet (mostly by players who like D/P).
---
More practically this patch cycle is going to have daredevil in a weak transition state, where the real costs of swipe are paid but compensatory buffs are not yet on the horizon.
---
THIS IS THE BLACKHOLE
---
You have any actual evidence to back this up about G2A? Do the credit card companies still process their payments ? 
---
Has there been any criminal investigations into them? 
---
K say this because any merchant that starts being hit with chargebacks , which they would if people are using stolen credit cards , won’t have their accounts for long. 
---
If as you say people are using the site to launder money via stolen credit cards that will also trigger an investigation. 
---
G2A has been around for more than two or three years now , so I figure there must be some actual evidence and investigations by the authorities. 
---
Do you have links to any of those?

---
They could now hear me out I don't think it'd be tomorrow because of the patch I however think its possible we could get a trailer during the second half of this week. They could decide its the finale lets break the 2 week cadences for releases and tomorrows patch is to allow players to get used to class changes so they don't next when the finale releases. Also in the past a trailer has released the same week as the devs playing through the current episode e.g. episode 5.
---
Even if what you said is true, so fucking what? 
---
The only one being a whiny bitch right is you.
---
Who says G2A isn’t a legitimate reseller ? 
---
There are scammers on EBay I’m not seeing people saying EBay is a scam site ? 
---
I’m confused. I know several people who have bought game keys from G2A with no problems. I’ve bought games from them years ago and the games still work today. Sooo... what’s the problem ?
---
I just came back and bought PoF.  Woooot!
---
What influx of new players?
---
Thats just making assumptions not actual evidence that there has been an influx of new players.
---
Dagger is better at sustained than sword, so better for raid fights like vg, gorse etc. Sword has better burst so better for fractals and fights like KC/CA.
---
Here you go: [Story Order Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/)
---
I played GW2 when it came out and stopped playing because the end game content was pretty much people literally running through the dungeons (barely killing any mobs because mobs don't have aggro for the entire dungeon) to get some tokens to get legendary armor that in the end had barely no upgrades other than visual (no gear treadmill). So it was like a grind fest of unchallenging content for visual rewards. Also, the no holy trinity was more like kiting mobs for the entire dungeon, which was not much fun. Lately I've been thinking about returning to the game, but has any of that changed?
---
Dynamic events in the open world usually chain into each other and changed based on if they succeed or fail. You can find events marked on the map or they will show up in the upper right if you are close enough. So if you follow the event and listen to what happens it may chain into another or you can just search the nearby area for more as there is always something going on. Also be on the lookout for NPCs with the [assistance required orange star](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dynamic_event#Event_indicators) above their heads to start more events. Really though I just killed enemies did close by events and moved on, leveling a new character recently was very fast and you'll get a lot of exp just from exploring new zones.
---
Had the same DC when the episode first released, losing that amount of progress hurt, but it allowed me to focus on the scripting better.
---
May I ask a question? Are keys for the expansions region locked? I've looked over the verified retailers in the link but as someone from the UK, there aren't a lot of options on the list for my country.
---
If I bought a key from one of the USA verified retailers, would I be able to use it on my EU/UK account? I did consult Google for an answer but I saw conflicting information from some sources.
---
Thank you for your time :)
---
Yes because MMO players love losing progress they've made and time they've put into their accounts. Especially when the only benefit is to save five bucks and support a company that freely deals with fraudsters and scammers, to the point where indie studios [have actively encouraged piracy](https://www.pcgamesn.com/action-henk/action-henk-g2a-piracy) over buying their game from G2A.
---
Whenever you are eligible to completely same story instance as another player the game will ask you whether you'd like to accept credit for the mission and move ahead with your story or not. The instance opener will be the one doing all the talking and appear in the cut scenes but others can still benefit but only if they are  eligible for that mission and choose yes when given the chance. In terms of eligibility, you have to make the same decisions throughoutbthe story to ensure you follow the same path. Every mission in the first half of the personal story gives you choices. If a player wants to make another choice and branch their story another way then they must say no to gaining credit for completing the instance.
---
have a friend who after talking with support was able to appeal after he spoke to them on the grounds he proceeded to buy the game from a trusted seller. i believe others have had the same thing so the account will be suspended not banned untill you get in touch with support.
---
Actually, wvw does a decent rate of gold as well now. Thanks to all those pips + reward track + drops from bags.
---
But the person is out of luck if their server has 0 tags.
---
Sounds like a cheese build that would almost never work to me. except against other zero toughness zero vit players.
---
Yeah it's like if armor and weapons in GW2 dropped with unremovable sigils and runes
---
Unreasonable levels of RNG to assemble a decent set
---
I can already see the threads crying about how there is no trailer today if there is none.
---
School of Velocity by Czerni? Been there, done that.
---
Any tips for new player to get into the game? I played it a tiny bit when it came out but stopped month or so after.
---
Okay awesome! That makes me feel good about leveling then. I definitely appreciate all of the help everyone has given me tonight, hopefully i can get it figured out and enjoy myself!
---
even if they aren't already out of date it will be by tomorrow
---

---
Happy to help, feel free to ask me if you have any questions as well or if you have an suggestions of things I add to my guide.
---
Im not with them but I see GOTD run basically everywhere a lot on EU. They call out the rate drops on mapchat as well, I really love them.
---
Yet people will still buy the next expansion, further funding this behavior, in hope that the game will be better than it was in BfA.
---
far batter let's say.
---
Talking is meaningless. See what comes in the future before declaring they improved. They said nothing new about content with their "roadmap", they revealed some features that may not even be released at all.
---
There's at least 3 classes that can peel and actually be useful while doing that. Weaver can easily be ignored by most builds.
---
yea i experienced it too, because people that fake them exist..but i strongly believe that it would be far messier if we got rid of the "system" completely
---
&gt; As a solution, how about real kill proofs?
---
i mean this is kinda what OP suggested..not exactly what you said, but a system in which they cannot be faked..so we've come full circle

Nah, Joko has always had a flair for the dramatic. He was just a little pissy that he was locked in a cage in effectively purgatory during path of fire and we didn't get to really explore his personality as much until we got closer to the confrontation.

Joko also has a long standing rivalry with Mad King Thorn, and you can see through the [dialogue](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Scarred_Psyche) they have that he's always been like this

There were developers and publishers that wanted to partner with them and had to stop because of PR backlash from communities like this. 
---
For the second time you’ve been unable to provide any evidence of any actual investigations by any authority on fraud, money laundering, or bad business practices. So I’m going to have to assume there are none. 
---
File this under mob justice and overblown claims like “Denuvo slows down my pc when playing games and there’s proof” . I’d put money on you believing that as well.
---
I always enjoy the SAB music but all these remixes are superb. You guys did such a great job.

no such thing

The Charr leather doesn't even have a decent engineer set for any cultural armor tier and that's pretty unacceptable. Their whole shtick is industrial warfare.

i always think that's it's such a shame anet didn't experiment more with dark areas, the lightning effects of torches, glowing cucumbers or armor look so awesome in the dark and adds some diffrence experince

Condi Soulbeast with double shortbow (also called SB³) is extremely easy to play as you only smash buttons on cooldown, which help focus on learning mechanics and such. This assumes the part of the game you're in works fine enough with condi DPS.
---
Power Soulbeast is a bit harder but still fairly easier than a Weaver build and around the same difficulty level as the Power Tempest (Sc/Wh) build. You have a bit more health but some animations can be tricky to land correctly at first and your most powerful skill (Axe 5) roots you in place so you gotta be careful about that.
---
Corsair set was def \~\~probably\~\~ done in one go and then spread thro whole season.
---
Elegy and requiem are basically one set minus glow.
---
Birthday thing was probably done right after 5th or slowly worked on. So they had year to "do it once a while" or make concept art for months and months.
---
They are amazing sets tho! And I really love all of em and the new direction they go towards with armor (no pantsu outfits)
---
They literally sell a service to "shield you" against scammers and fradulent keys.  
---
If thats not the red flag of the century in their awareness of it being done, I don't know what is.
---
Do not focus on "heart" quests in the begining of the game. Few merchants in vanilla Tyria sells useful things but overall its outdated.
---
Get this when you can https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ash_Legion_Spy_Kit (available for karma in starting charr area). 
---
And this https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Harpy_Feathers_(consumable)
---
Those can be used in fractals, dungeons, story instances and open world and very valuable for any class (less so for thiefs).
---
You dont need thougness in open world. It will only slow your down. Marauder gear if you want extra survivability for little cost.
---
Fantastic, will do friend!
---
How come no one mentions scrapper. Really strong heals, strongest condi removal but boons, instead converts condis into boons.
---
Also want to let folks know about https://isthereanydeal.com/ which includes most if not all games and doesn't include grey market resellers.
---
Nah, I just insist that a shady company known for destroying indie companies and having only the bare bones of both consumer and publisher protection is cancerous and should be avoided at all costs.
---
And typically poke fun at madlads who want to play devils advocate at all costs.

curiously, this one is a karma exclusive, one of the best cheap skins too

I'd recommend taking a little time to clean out the others before you start spending guaranteed unlocks

I mean, we all know that Blizzard was never perfect, but they put effort in and helped make the community something to really be part of. People regularly compare the launch of BFA to MoP and are holding out hope, the difference is that WoW is a game now so focused on how long people are online for and keeping active subs that they’ve done all these “get rich quick schemes”. The company I currently work for merged with a larger company in 2010 - we are still changing policies in both areas nine years later. It doesn’t happen as quickly as people seem to think. Either way, they have a lot of pushing shit uphill to fix this one.
---
I still change build fairly often due to my love for trying new builds and what not, but appearance and stats I feel is essential together.  
---
I personally don't use the other tabs aside from the odd occasions. I usually change glider and dye mounts when I create a character and barely even touch those tabs again.  
---
Ofc the UI is a bit cluttered, but I don't see it as an essential need for change.
---
Haha i thought the same exact thing. Except I called someone a cunt twice (because that’s how they were acting), and I was suspended for two hours because my language violated ToS. I actually couldn’t believe it, but after that I don’t really log in anymore. That level of censorship when the opposing player has the ability to block me is a bit outrageous. Suspending me like that is extremely rudimentary, and I would call that same person a cunt again. Ezpz.
---
I was excited for the changes to berserk because the f1 will now count as a tier 3 burst, but then I see this meme and look at the utility slots I have as a warrior.  I hope no one wants banners if I take this build.
---
add -forwardrenderer line to the gw2 shortcut, it helped my girlfriend
---
what a clown
---
Where can I buy the cassette tape?
---
Any idea on what times they run it? I took a look at [SAND]'s calendar and it's totally empty aside from guild missions :V
---
How can it be clean money if they stole it from a credit card. The owner can always go back on the transaction. And if it's cash money it's still a loss. This logic has a ton of flaws
---
&gt;you can do something about the water 1 and earth 1 skill as well.
---
Ok! Reduced range of water aa to 240 (slowing it down to keep the same travelling time and also making it a  destoyable/reflectable projectile). Reduced the range of earth aa to 0, making it always spawn a pillar right under caster's ass. This update is all about dagger's indentity!

Also if you're an engineer, you can use flamethrower autos and the effects cancel each other out.

That's on the lower end...
---
The were taking down Druid for a long time. Since they took his HP down and then his healing as well. I went for healing Firebrand long time ago but when I see this I feel that druid will not be used for a long time xD

---
Pretty much everyone I know keeps most of their qadim/dhuum Kp around.  Are you on EU or NA?
---
Shame they won't let Rage skills also count as Physical skills for the purposes of Peak Performance.  &gt;.&gt;
---
a good rev is the only thing that I dont think i can ever win against at this point. mirage/holo/glassy blockspam guard all really strong too. and boonbeast kind of broken so you've got a lot of options.
---
I would probably recommend dragonhunter guardian or druid. DHs have a rather easy rotation and still do very good damage on most encounters. Getting berserker gear is also the easiest to get. Druids are almost always looked for and their "rotation" is as easy as it gets. You might need to take some mechanics but you should have more than enough time to do them and still do your job. That is the build I started on back when magi gear was still fine. 
---
Not sure if this is a good advice but necromancers have viable and easy to get into builds as well. They are still burdened by a negative taste in many raiders mouths though as they are never really the best options. You shozld prepare for a long lone/hate relationship if you plan on playing necromancer.
---
I run such a build sometimes. You can bring down minstrel guards fairly quickly, and I can down non-tanky players that are mounted with a single rapid fire (2 seconds?). It's worse than what people feared deadeye would be before PoF came.
---
For those curious, I believe the DPS build will use the following utilities (at least my 1st tests will be with these)
---
DPS will depend on Berserk Uptime, and outrage is the rage skill that gives you the most if you break a stun. Lucky us Headbutt does just that, so while we are used to use Shattering Blow + Headbutt to fill or adrenaline, with this combo and the changes to Blood Reckoning (doesn't give adrenaline anymore only recharges Primal Burst) I think we will use To the Limit to fill adrenaline.
---
Bolas is the best physical skill regarding Peak Performance uptime so that needs to be on as well
---
This leaves one slot open, which is where Peak Performance uptime vs Berserk uptime comes to play. I haven't tested yet, but if in fact the combo of Bolas and Kick is enough to keep perma (or very near perma) uptime of Peak Performance that on itself seems too god to not use, but since this all still needs testing, if it comes to show that better Berserk uptimes equals higher dps compared to Peak Performance (since Bolas alone is already really decent uptime) then we most likely gonna slot Wild Blow
---
So it gonna look like:
---
To the Limit - Kick - Bolas - Outrage - Headbutt
---
Or
---
To the Limit - Bolas - Wild Blow - Outrage - Headbutt
---
Rotation will need testing but following these rules it makes sence that you use the combo Headbutt/Outrage as soon as you get on Berserk so you can get the maximum rotation of that inside of Berserk as possible. A full rotation of these 2 skills should actually give you 8 secs, because you will be able to use one extra Outrage before Headbutt is ready but when used solo the skill will only give you 1 extra second. After that I beleive rotation should look like the old one from core warrior that used double axe/GS with you know, berserk and everything else here mentioned in between
---
&gt; Power Berserker will probably be taken over power core Warrior on fights where you don't really need CC, 
---
Why do you say that, when Berserker gives access to two extremely strong CC skills?
---
Oh they definitely do make promises. They outright said there would be faster releases of raids, used to say fractal leaderboards were coming, a second raid team was being trained, episodes would release within a 3-4 month timeframe, etc. 
---
It's why ANet shouldn't make statements they can't keep.
---

---
Automating with software is not allowed.
---
You can, however, assign another skill to be launched on cooldown (default is skill 1). Check [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Auto-attack).
---
Pretty sure thats just the "Gifted Email" so someonr gifted you a BLK.
---
This is only a problem because they can get away with this damage stacking without sacrificing survivability because Moa stance Perma protection plus Weakness juat shrugs off the heaviest hits.
---
They were in stealth too before going for the burst, so didnt even see them coming lol
---
not allowed too if you go afk. if a gm messages you qhile doing it you have to be able to respond
---
That is from a player not from Anet. If it would be from Anet then you would have the Anet logo next to it I belive.
---
when i took the ss i had my mouse over the "a gift from" "lion" but the popup didnt capture, it is possible you are right that maybe another player did gift if from the trading post and that is how it appears. 
---
i do know that when i gifted the bunny ears, the recipients knew it was from me tho.
---
Just playing. For each win you get 10 pips. If you have any top stat you get an additional pip. For losing you get 3 pips, plus 1 for top stats and 1 if it was a close game. 
---
Every few pips (at the beginning it's 20) you get a chest containing unidentified dyes, (ascended) shards of glory and simply gold. 
---
The final chest gives you whooping 20 gold and can be repeated. 
---
Open the PvP Panel and you can see under "League" what the rewards are. 
---
AND on top of that you get stuff from the reward track of your choosing. AND if you haven't done the achievements yet you get 5 gold (plus a ton of achievement points) for finishing each of the Achievement Sets for each PvP map.
---
AND you could slowly start working towards the legendary backpack. 
---
That's what I've done. Every time I played, I played around three games a day and while I was in queue I gathered materials in core Tyria. In the time it took to finish the achievements for The Ascension I easily made enough gold to buy all the materials to craft it and I earned a TON of achievement points. 
---
Currently while I'm working towards becoming level 100 in PvP I earn the stuff I need to craft legendary Armor. 
---
The Legendary gear from PvP is probably the easiest you can go for.
---
you must be right, still i'm excited
---
It's not from anet, it's standard mail from when player gifts you something through gemstore
---
Being afk while doing something (other than crafting I hope...) Can get you banned.
---
On the other hand look at all the nekros/rangers afk farming and nothing happens to them :/
---
I also did some quick calculations for a Banner build (so only 1 utility available and assuming Blood Reckoning is used). You still have 11 sec gained every 16 sec (Outrage + Headbut + Blood reckoning).
---
* Initial = 15 + 5 = 20 sec
---
* Add 11 sec = 31 sec
---
* End of loop 1 --&gt; 15 sec remaining (+16 used)
---
* Add 11 sec = 26 sec
---
* End of loop 2 --&gt; 10 sec remaining (+16 used)
---
* Add 11 sec = 21 sec
---
* End of loop 3 --&gt; 5 sec remaining (+16 used)
---
* Add 11 sec = 16 sec
---
* End of loop 4 --&gt; 0 sec remaining (+16 used)
---
So even if you need to delay some skills a bit or have some alacrity drop the 4th loop is still realistic imo (5 sec is a wide enough window) so that would get you a 60-64 sec berzerker phase. However your setup for when you want to go in Berserker for the very 1st time of the fight can be complicated if you don't wanna delay it.
---
YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!!! *csi theme*

---
Today we are running out of gemstore features hidden in one of previous patches(ritualist outfit), that means we are gettin new batch of items next week. This, plus an weekly season recap ending suggest that it would be very elegant to have trailer today and episode 6 next week. 
---
Less likely that we are getting another gem content patch lasting for another 3 weeks.
---
Just a bit scared to rely too much on outrage, as random stability can be quite common in raids.
---
A hive of scum and villainy.
---
Not mentioning the shitshow with legendary pve armor. Oh for their sake I wouldn't want them to be transparent. They would be forced to straight up lie in our faces. Brazil died for our sins.
---
Wait 4/6? We have helm, coat and legs but I don't remember other parts.
---
I too am Ranger main since 2008 and gw1 (where we had awesome ranger armors btw.. miss my obsidian gw1 armor soooo bad).
---
In gw2 it’s mostly trash and trench coats.. Honestly I’m not sure which devs decided rangers should dress like a cowboy in the future but whatever...
---
The only armor set I actually use in gw2 is the medium Mistforged (PvP tier 2). Other sets are the Ardent (PvP tier 1), and both Triumphant sets (both are tier 1 &amp; 2 from WvW). There are a few others but those are my preference for a “chest” that doesn’t have long tails like a dress or a trench coat... (Unless you actually like the trench coats then you are all set, lol)
---
It’s really hard in gw2 to find a pve armor that doesn’t look like a trench coat so that’s why I encourage you to look at the wiki online and also into armor acquired in other game modes. (PvP/WvW)
---
Good luck and remember part of the “end game” is fashion wars so getting armor pieces for collections and/or for rare skin unlocks is a huge part of the end game (for some players)
---
Also with transmute charges and unlimited dyes you can mix and match and play around as much as you like so just enjoy yourself and welcome to the fashion wars!
---
As main warrior the changes on berserker are awesome. I feel sorry for your feelings then.
---
&gt;And all those people who invested time and gold in that class? Screw them?
---
I don't see how the removal of GoE makes them so unplayable.
---
Druid players will still be able to play, the choice will not be just as straightforward as it used to.
---
Today's patch, for example.
---
Your i9 means nothing, because game can only use like 2 cores and there is nothing you (or devs) can do, it's just engine bottlenecking the game, we have to wait for guild wars 3.
---
I also don't like god tiered armor or outfits because they are too Human specific, except for Fallen Balthazar helm because we can pretend we claimed it from Balthazar as a trophy. 
---
It makes no sense why a Charr would wear a god themed outfit for example, and the outfits are straight out god outfits - not even acolyte outfits a regular mortal would wear.
---
A lot of people I know from that game. Forums/Reddit with a lot of complaints. Me as disappointed player.
---
not intimately connected to the issue, but some of us have little choice. here in australia, unless we buy gem cards we can be paying up to 40-60% more, which those things have been rapidly disappearing from our retailers.
---
Why do Australians have to pay so much more?
---
And suddenly requests from community are getting scheduled and communication is at last a thing. :Shrug:
---
Pretty generic if you ask me
---
theoreticaly yes
---
Wait some more, most likely new mount will be much cheaper, but not as fast.
---
Yeah exactly. I really miss the elite sunspear (think that's what it was called ) in gw1 too
---
&gt; a second raid team was being trained
---
lol they never said anything like this. All we heard was that Crystal was training new hires during Bastion's development, there was absolutely zero mention of those new hires being trained up for a second raid team.
---
So same as when I quit abit over a year ago then. Is the console version launching on pc again though? With different devs?
---
&gt; more communication from Anet, more and better patches like the one we have tomorrow 
---
Which patches are these? I don't follow this sub daily so I have no idea.
---
360k? but that was clearly not on a golem, right?
---
Game is running on DX9 which is the biggest bottleneck. Look for the DX912 mod on github https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases
---
Put the ZIP into your main GW2 directory, unpack it and run the installer. Press Enter until you're done (except you want to run arcdps, DM if so)
---
Before you run the installer, have all the graphical options you want to have already set as switching some might crash your game.
---
Disable "best texture filtering" (sometimes wonky blue effect)
---
This mod will basically give you all the fps you would want. Although it's not perfect, the game runs silky smooth compared to before.
---
As said, was a party event. But know people who have achieved some insane crits on the golem tho. OPs question was about about world tho not the golem :p
---
T1 fractals is for learning. I have found people as new as freshly boosted level 80 trying fracs with some friends there.  Ofcourse there is off chance that you may find salty people there, but usually people don't mind just be polite and say you're new and learning. 
---
Easiest way to get guilds however would be map chat. In places like lion's arch or any major cities just ask around and you'll find plenty of offers.
---
Ranger singlehandedly killing fun from wvw. Camp from range and elevation and do outragepus damage while having the choice to run away using invuln stealth and mobility. Broken shit kills all 1vx or small scale roaming.
---
its against gw2 ToS so do so at your own risk
---
Check out meta battle
---
9900K has one of the highest single core benchmarks.
---
Yeah great idea. I'll check out the ones you posted. Thanks bud
---
Gs build have a very bad rate
---
There is also a [subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/) where guilds advertise.
---
My ghetto blaster needs this.
---
Because the sample size is very low. It was rated by 5 people, one giving 0 stars because of one trait. If you take out that extreme case the remaining rating is 4.5/5.
---
All I want is for my longbow to be this good in PvE
---
The girl singing in Storm Top nailed it.
---
Yes but I dont see any problem you know. Only a person who was expecting something else. Just a dissapointed player and thats all. No problme at all.
---
You forgot to add that he is chill AF. But, everyone will be when they have a frikin Charr posing as Dwayna acolyte with a box of chocos. Cool AF
---
No, power chrono is one of the best solo builds in the game. Just keep in mind that you have very little sustain as your heal skill is part of your burst and you don't have any skills/traits that actually heal you apart from signet of the ether which you want to use for dps.
---
You have to use your active defenses correctly as you cannot really facetank anything. F4, sword4 and sword2 alongside your dodge key are what you want to use for that.
---
literally could just download sharex or gyazo on your computer. no actual way using your phone is the easiest approach.
---
It would be more popular in my opinion.
---
The glassiest cannon
---
That's a pretty broad question. What type of content are you interested in? Story / open world exploration / small-scale pvp / large-scale pvp / small group instanced content / large group events in open world  / jumping puzzles / fashion wars / legendary weapons / ...?
---
But in general don't worry about quickly leveling up or getting ascended gear or whatever, and just enjoy the game at your own pace. Pretty much everything you do in the game gives you exp, so there's no need for grinding or farming  (unless you want to craft legendary weapons or specific skin collections).
---
What's your account name?
---
In wow I really liked role-playing, thought about giving it a go in GW as well, are there any "role play" forums?
---
Otherwise the fractals I read about sound good and interesting
---
You get FPS increase with the use of up to 10 cores (tested on my i9-7980xe by turning off/on cores usage in game).
---
1440p actually. Isn't that 2k? Anyway it seems of all settings, reducing the character limit was the one that helped the most. It's now 80 FPS but on Medium but stuttering still happens
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Upcoming_changes_and_features/2019-04-23
---
There are some places where roleplayers usually gather, eg. I often see them [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Apprentice_Carrels). But if you ask in large cities map chat, they can probably send you guild invites. There are often guid recruitments ads on these map chats as well.
---
For fractals you need to be lvl80, so that's something to work towards :) Also above fractal lvl20ish you need some ascended gear to put agony resistance infusions in, but ascended trinkets are easy to get if you have Living Story Season 3 on your account.
---
Came back to GW2 after a break since before HoF release, game is so much fun, there is so much more to do and compared to every other game and MMO I've tried in the mean time GW2 is still so far above anything out there.
---
My monitor is on top of books. I feel you.
---
Proportions need work, but the asura turned out great and I love the style and colour palette!
---
Dont buy anything from there, the trouble you may get and the support of this shitty site is not worth the maybe 10$ you save.

If you are looking to be a toxic asshole maybe LoL is more your speed?

none of these i would neccessarily identify as gw2 artwork
---
&gt; shoot earth fists at the foes
---
I want that!
---
I don't see it as essential to change either.  it's a bit clunky right now, but manageable.
---
Massive ads (for MMO, seeing how stale that genre has become) around major cities like NY and LA. also lot of youtube ads
---
You can also import your steam/gog wishlists and they can send email when they go on sale! You can setup how big discount it has to be too so not all those -10% sales appear there.
---
10/10
---
Removing Dalaran portals to make the world feel bigger.  Giving away current pvp season level gear away in the afk warfronts, and literally doing nothing to keep us interested
---
Tbh the current Berserker mode mechanics were fine, if they really wanted to make Rage skills more useful, they should have made more of them buffs instead of movement locked situational skills which pale in comparison to Signet Shouts or Banners. 
---
I would have totally been fine with a Primal Burst rework because a majority of them aren't really powerful at all compared to what a core warrior can pull off, and it is the only defining feature compared to core warrior. 
---
The whole rage = more berserker duration thing feels like they are forcing the player to use more rage skills in order to use the revamped Primal Bursts more, which guess what, most players are just gonna ignore anyway, cos they are too damned weak to other utility options. 
---
If left to me, I would just revamp rage skills as a focal point, and make each Primal Burst cast extend berserker mode.
---
People were tricking support into obtaining multiple baubles before hand.  I don't believe you can obtain the second one from the back piece yet as it's impossible to have the crimson coins
---
I'll just leave this here, in case someone still wondering.

Kind of exactly what i wanted to say, so i second this.
---
Yeah, our chrono discovered that the day he tried to do canons ... fun moment :')
---
Make them both close range AoE's at least it'll fit with what they wanted to apparently do lol. Inb4 no movement skills, gets kited more than reaper with less hp, less damage and just dies. Yey
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd2qsC-PuJQ  Here i go again :P
---
if you are on EU i have a good deal
---
People will most likely play them exactly how they would currently : 
---
Ignore every rage skill besides Heal, Outrage and Headbutt.
---
The other Rage skills are basically garbage compared to the core warrior utilities, especially the burst of Might from shouts and signet.
---
Heck, people also rather run Banners than Rage skills like Wild Blow which seriously pales in comparison to stuff like Kick which has 3 charges when using as a CC skill.
---
&gt; I've posted numerous times
---
where have you posted?, it is better to read guild advertisements, and choose based on proffered content, and their general ad text (in case you find it attractive), apply to couple, save spot for Raid guild, and for personal bank guild
---
Joins in 'cross finger team' :)
---
Which is why I love doing canons with my DH. Free dash on F2.
---
They are portraits of her *Guild Wars 2* characters. The *Asura* and the *Sylvari* ones do a bit no?
---
So colors are on point but proportions need improvement? Many thanks for this feedback!
---
Scientifically speaking no, that's not how it works.
---
I'm loving that no two profession icons are the same on that snippet of the log animation. Diversity is good.
---
WOW! That's quality armor!
---
anything but cultural is usually stretched and wonky looking on both but norn have it slightly better as they are human shaped with ridiculous proportions, except female norn, they have good proportions and the males don't for some reason. thematically any light armour class would fit better on norn as charr look down upon magic and all the light armour classes are magic, if you care about that sort of thing.
---
Norn are like big bulky humans, not much of a change skin wise here.
---
Charr got a completely other character model which can mess with the general esthetic of an armor. Heavy armor should have the least laughable skins for chars (at least in my opinion).
---
Extry info: I almost never show the headpiece, so I can't tell about those. I find the most of them ugly, no matter which race I play and I like to see the characters head  since I put some time into its creation ;)
---
the game just runs badly, you could run it on a NASA super computer and you would still get fps lag in LA and the grove, among other places
---
I looked at the jpeg and read the thing and still don't understand at all how he dodge through it, please ELI5
---
I disagree with # 8 it should be before # 6 or with #6.  Small groups run back but large groups don't and I think the extra supply is more important than the speed.  Also the amount you get back is low.
---
Its a strong healer, but we have stronger healers with more boons.

Don't refer to 1440p as 2k - that is **wrong**  - it's a stupid term that needs to die, if only for its misuse and subsequent confusion it brings.

That's the thing, I have i5-6600 which goes from 80% to 100% usage when using dx12, it also taxes my GTX 960 2GB and 8GB RAM quite a bit more but those still have some headroom unlike the CPU so I suspect it's CPU bottleneck.
---
Example scenario would be Rata Sum SAB festival entrance (populated area): 40 FPS with "vanilla" game, 30 FPS with dx12. It does get rid of the stuttering so the game appears smoother overall but I rather take the extra FPS and I also tend to alt-tab a lot and d912pxy doesn't seem to like that.
---
If I would have seen this portraits in a different forum, I wouldnt have guessed that they are gw2 characters.
---
The asura looks like an elvish thing with its ears pointing up instead of to the side or down, which is more typical of asura ears. Head should also be more wide instead of tall.
---
Sylvari is called shiny tree but doesnt look like a tree at all.

First concept character looks god-awful all around.

The number in front of the k counts the horizontal pixels, approximately at least, while the -p number is about the vertical pixels. 3840x2160 is 4k or 2160p (rarely used), 1920x1080 is 2k (rarely used) or 1080p, 2560x1440 is 2.5k (rarely used) or 1440p.

Better in PvE, likely worst/cheesier in PvP

Is there any good resources/addons for achievement collections? I constantly feel overwhelmed when I go into the achievement panel as everything feels disconnected and like I'll need a guide at any second. It would be awesome to have something like a zone completion guide similar to ESO.

The silver-fed is the same tier as a Mystic Salvage kit. If you get cooper and use it for blues/greens, use mystic for rares/exotics you will have some many of them you won't be needing to think about a silver fed for years. Because I was too lazy to carry around 50 salvage packs I used the mystic (250) on everything, I was burning through them fast since HoT and decided to get the bundle of cooper+silver. The silver is STILL sitting in my bank waiting for the day when I don't have any more mystic kits (I can make 9 more for the stones I have right now, and I'm still getting them). Copper fed is the best item you can get on the cash shop imo so I definetly suggest going for it, as for the silver one think about it only when you don't have the stones (and won't be getting them easily). I have my cooper fed in a shared inv slot so all my chars can benefit, then it's a matter of just taking out a mystic kit out of the bank for each   
---
tl;dr Cooper fed: Whites/Blues/greens, Mystic kit: Rares (and exotics if you don't have any BL kits), BL kit: Exotics

I have no idea. I've seen more complexity in a cough from Ikea.

I don't think that's necessarily true, they just will be forced need to learn how the bosses work and what they need to contribute to the group to succeed.
---
They keep having promotions to sign people up for a 6 month or year long subscription too. The number of people I've read who've bought one and then quit playing after a single month and don't have much regret about it astounds me. That's money literally being thrown away for nothing, rewarding Blizzard for it's bad behaviour and poor game design. The number of people not resubbing now unless there are big improvements made have made me hopeful that Blizzard will now start to listen once these long subs are over and they will panic about not meeting those sub targets.

I threw most of my Mystic stones in the MF with 3 cheap exotics. I had a tiny profit after over 300 tries. This is without counting the Pre (Spark) I got during that.
---
Unless there are better ways to use those stones Ill keep chucking them in the MF.

Might open up possibilities for 2 Berserkers, 1 running a banner each. It might be so worth running 2 Berserkers that you can take up 2 slots for the meaty DPS, but time will tell.
---
For me G2A is the only way: My credit card info was stolen around the same time I bought PoF, When I opposed, PoF payment also bounced. They banned me until i explained. They reverted the ban but told me I couldn't buy anything from their official websites anymore. Goodbye Gems, you were truly outrageous.  
---
(Also all the retail stores/websites in my area don't sell it anymoar.)
---
Problem with this is, the official price is basically constant with no big dips.
---
There were a few deals but they are so rare and if you dont follow GW2 you wont notice and i wont pay 60€ (or whatever the current price is today, cant check the page because it wont load correctly) for an expansion that is years old :/
---
If they would have reasonable prices, people wouldnt be using key seller sites in the first place. Aith accounting for how long its out ===&gt; the older it is the cheaper it should be, which it isnt, not only for GW2 but basically all big digital content. The Mass Effect trilogy is still around 90€ if they dont have a deal going... DLC that is more than 10 years old is still 20€ because their prices dont dip outside of time limited deals...
---
Its just sucks and im not ashamed of using key seller sites, atleast there prices are reasonable if you wait long enough :/
---
That's not Charr. That's Quattro.
---
Is there a way to buy an expantion and replace the one that I had bought from G2A??? I don’t wanna lose my acc T^T

I wouldn't say worst, definitly worst among war specs but not worst over all.

There has been conflicted discussions and people are sometimes not truthful about their interactions with support. Some state that re-buying the expansion from gw2 or an approved retailer was enough to get unbanned while others claimed that they could not get an appeal thru. I chose the latter because it’s better to be safe than sorry.
---
LOL I played this game primarily for sPvP back when there was actually a scene. But I guess its a dead game after all. Nothing left to do.
---
Why are the gems cheaper from those sellers than directly in-game?
---
I purchased every time from mmoga but last one was g2a.
---
and quickly a direct purchase from the in-game store which is expensive.
---
I pay for 2000 gems 18,99 Euro.
---
I believe [GOTD] (EU) runs a HoT meta train every monday evening starting at like 19:40 CEST or whenever Verdant Brink start, (sometimes even including Dragon's Stand) and a Serpent's Ire + PoF minis every tuesday evening, and other things at other times.

Really quick and dirty google search, but here's a 2016 statement from tinybuild about how generally bad g2a is: https://www.tinybuild.com/single-post/2017/04/28/G2A-sold-450k-worth-of-our-game-keys
---
And here's a newspost with more links to follow, which mention an indie studio called Ragesquid and a developer named Lars Doucet: https://www.gamerevolution.com/features/13995-indie-dev-asks-you-to-pirate-his-game-rather-than-buy-it-on-g2a
---
This was also right after g2a tried to partner up with Gearbox to sell the newest Bulletstorm game, which in itself is pretty interesting to read up on.
---
I think I fell in that in the fractal hall and got stuck in a perma-falling loop.
---
Not sure why you would eliminate crafting as an option.   With GW2crafts.net, crafting of 500 can be reached very quickly and time gated crafting mats can be purchased on the TP.  With crafting, it's faster than getting a second character through the HoT story for a second Calodbolg (unless that toon has a substantial headstart in the story)
---
How do I save the sound settings? My audio levels are always reset when i restart the game with launchbuddy.  
---
Keep up the good work, LB is fantastic!
---
For a new player I would say 250 is a good number. Personally I still don't salvage that many rares for Mystic Salvage Kits to become inconvenient and warrant spending 400-500 gems.
---
Attunements on F1 F2 F3 F4 is fine tho, having your class specific skills binded to those keys is usually worth it, maybe on Chronomancer its less effective because you get a fifth scatter but whatever.
---
Mouse buttons are usually cool for binding your target-next-target or target-nearest-target and your dodgerolls etc.
---
Power Tempest still exists, but it isn't nearly as good as it once was. It's not a good pick for raids, but it can be pretty decent in Fractals iirc, especially with high AR. Weaver is by far the better offensive specialization these days though for Ele.
---
I was half joking but I do sometimes use 100 salvage kits pretty quickly (I'm mainly buying basic salvage kits for random loot)
---
Lmao this thread is a dumpster fire. Top comment is one hell of a r/woooosh and all your comments are downvoted despite being correct, while stuff that's just plain wrong got upvoted. Gotta love the gw2 sub. I agree with you, they should juist let us hide that stuff, I've done the story way too often already, it's not fun and even if it was we should still be able to disable it. Have a nice day
---
k
---
Which of those builds would you say has the simplest rotation for someone new to GW2?
---
You sadly can't do that easily. (antoher reason why i am not a fan of the loginfile method). You would have to launch your gamevwithout launchbuddy. Configure your desired settings and close the game. Then recreate all existing login files.
---
It has nothing to do with your rig.
---
And it is server, that is to blame.
---
Addons not, but this [website](https://gw2ap.com/) is a godsend for this. Just enter your API and you're good to go.
---
Thanks god the world does not revolve around you.
---
Whoops i meant water 1, not water 2. 
---
I really don't think earth 1 is that much of a problem right now. It still has a function and it's an auto-attack on a class that has access to a lot of different attacks. I think on classes like Elementalist and Engineer the auto-attacks should be kept as low damage with a minor utility attached to it. Water 1 in my opinion could be beefed up a bit. It just doesn't do enough I feel.
---

It may be cheese, but in PvP areas, there has to be limits even for cheese. 
---
1-shots are just not fun when you don't have a deathcam to show you who one-shotted you and how they did it so you can learn to avoid it, and when you can't use environmental cover to advance more safely.
---
I don't think we'll ever get WvW more littered with objects so there's always some cover, and even with cover there's lots of gap closers and movement skills that can render cover pointless, so the combat has to be more in line with that.
---

---
This is funny cause my boss was literally showing me a video of this (the new Singapore airport) yesterday
---
According to that article it's not a continuous moving damage wall. It's basically a pulsing damage thing that has set locations. Meaning you can get lucky and dodge through it or at least that is what I got from reading that article.
---
Norn can turn into large bears no matter their size.
---
The flame wall only kills when it is on those specific markers, so if you completely move your hitbox through the flamewall while it is moving between those markers, you won't die. Doing so is almost entirely luck based (unless you actually know in game where those dots are), but skills with very high movement speed means you are in contact with the wall for less time, reducing the chance you die.
---
Isn't that every patch though ^s
---
I... didn't ask him you...?
---
I'll do what I can to get it updated in the next few days. :)
---
Wait for patch to hit and meta to settle down before deciding. Berserker is getting some changes today so it might be a new dps meta build.
---
https://discretize.eu/builds/elementalist/power-tempest
---
Scepter/Warhorn is still strong.  D/WH has fallen out of favor except in casual open world play.  It's still a pretty niche build, but it's not overly difficult to play, is very bursty and has more utility than you would think.  Tempest is great at stacking might too.  Will come back and edit later.  I believe it's burst falls off after it's 8th or 9th air overload -- it relies heavily on awareness of dmg multipliers.
---
Are you saying people poor enough to think about the costs of games should not be playing games at all? What should they do, work 16 hours a day because every second of free time is wasted?
---
Everyone has free time, including poor people and assuming that they don't have their priorities straight because they deserve some minutes of fun is incredibly condescending.
---
Yes, i more or less agree about autoattacks being basic, but whatever does feel very lackluster, and earths functionality is fine, it’s just very clunky to use and has hitbox problems.
---
toss four items in, see what happens.
---
Wow, I didn't know I have a so-called 2k (1920×1080). I call it FullHD, and I thought 2k is something more elite and expensive.

My final straw was when they said oh we dont do class changes mid expac after stating they couldnt finish shadow priests and shamans before BfA launch and said to wait til 8.1. 8m1 brought a small talent change and a numbers change after they said they were going to rework those classes. Dont lie to your customers. Left for FFXIV and prob one of the best decisions I've ever made.
---
ahahaha nooooo dont look
---
F
---
Can you elaborate why? Sorry not very good at these things but super curious as a Necro main.
---
My thoughts: because it took so much work to redo it, they were left with very little time for some of the other specs. Eg: they decided to slap on unblockable and nerf steal range by 50% as a last minute decision, instead of actually thinking it through and making a meaningful change.
---
It's like PvE legendary armours again. Put in all the effort on heavy, then do the light, and finally use the left over time before deadline for medium - the lack of polish on medium speaks volumes about priority.
---
Does this post have anything to do with the actual changes to berserker? Nope. Don't care, because spellbreaker will still dominate over it.
---
I think one big problem of Elementalist is that the element-based identity needs to be stronger if they want a greater (&gt;1) amount of weapons to be properly balanceable.
---
The problem with **that** is that as long as we have item-stats, the stances cannot be properly balanced based on different identities because say if Water is to be the support stance then someone without any support stats on gear will automatically get less benefit from it (and hence want to be in it less than someone in full support gear.
---
Sure, in a far-far-out-there world I'd like them to remove item stats and base skills entirely based on their integrated values + traits, which would in turn open up both elemental stances and Revenant legends to support those two classes as "mid fight role switchers". But it's unlikely, and I can't see them do much otherwise. Not truuuuly.

You can test it yourself.

Its confusing because there is no unified naming system. Some call it UHD, others 4k, and if UHD is 4k, some started calling FHD 2k, and there you have it. Though i think its likely that 2k, 4k etc will take the naming crown due to the coming bigger displays, 8k now and 16k somewhere in the future.

I'm afraid that's not possible :(

Hey guys, I finally hit level 80 and unlocked the Reaper specialization. I was recommended the Condi Reaper build, but I am not sure what traits or skills for the right side skill slots I should use.

Also, what ascended gear recipe should I choose from the choices?
---
Not sure if this fits your thoughts but the adrenaline cost opens more counterplay. If you get interrupted during berserk activation your opponent has a time window before you can activate it again:you need to charge the bar again. Also now decapitate doesn't have a CD if it lands so in order to not be able to spam it entirely the activation rate will be gated by your ability to fill the adrenaline bar between casts.

i am still wondering which one of the developers took that truckload of lsd when designing fractals.

i just wait until you discovered sylvaries and what you can do with them with all the colours :)
---
Valk should actually be fine with decimate defenses :P
---
Has a soft, dreamy look to it. Rather like it.
---
Well that's pretty stupid grammar
---
That is possible but they did mention that these changes for the elite specs will be coming out in waves. So this one is Berserker, DD, Druid, and Rev (not elite but makes it different from its elites).
---
I've actually always like the Berserker spec and never really had much of an issue with it. I haven't even tried the Spellbreaker as of yet (mainly because Warrior is my alt class and I've been playing more Engi than anything). I am excited to possibly see power berserker builds appear.
---
I'm actually excited to see the future changes to other specs as well. Like I said I main Engi and I really like Scrapper but I feel that even with the most recent changes it still has a bit to go. Like the Function Gyro feels like it is lacking and needs a rework. But that is just my opinion and we will have to wait and see what happens. It is just fun the theory craft out there things sometimes.
---
Rebind character turning with a/d into character strafing. This way you can still side peddle while moving camera freely, alternatively walk forward and turn camera so you don’t drop mov.speed.
---
Combine that with «about face» or the «look behind» keys and it should sort it.
---
Character turning is 9/10 times never needed. Strafing also allows for simpler LoS’ing or jiggle peaking.
---
You're in a story instance killing rats. I think it would be pretty easy to get away with

I just wish the rest of the fractal didn't exist.

Can you settle down a bit and not act like a toddler throwing a tantrum?
---
Your initial comment was idiotic on several levels:
---
1. It was completely pointless and contributed nothing to the discussion
---
2. It only serves to antagonize in a vain attempt to make yourself look smart
---
3. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in%20theory It's amazing that you are arguing over the use of an idiom and shows a level of pettiness that's frankly baffling. However, what I meant wasn't that his post was a theory. I merely said  that scientifically speaking his post *doesn't even remotely meet the requirements of a hypothesis*. He used the word theory, however, properly, because in addition to its scientific meaning, it also has a more general meaning, as illustrated by Oxford Dictionary, point 1.2 : https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/theory
---
Now, for the love of God, shut up because you are seriously embarrassing yourself.
---

---
Yea, shouldn't be abused... Do you believe in it? You even described what each skip means.
---
I mean... After almost 7 years showing arah skips which are in the game since it was released in 2012 is kind of worth it at some point but NOT on reddit, lol.
---
Ps. p3/p4 skip that 90% of people show me (including yours in video) is gayish.

Fun fact! New LA (2014-present) has been around more than twice as long as old LA (2012-2014).
---
I have a question about these changes too. Is this mostly a nerf to condi warrior?
---
So you want to one shot people from a safe distance without any repercussions?
---
GTFO
---
Don't worry, thieves will be forgotten; just like the massive acro nerf they did (the real trade-off) before the release of DD (to make DD relevant - because it is acro 2.0) was forgotten.
---
Thieves are a laughing stock when it comes to balance patches for a reason; no other classes gets treated the way thieves get treated in nearly every single balance patch...because ANet simply does not know how to deal with the class. They don't actually have a vision for the class.
---
People move nature spirits around, if there's a solo dgh they take SYG for retal uptime and put stab on 10 people
---
We need to check once it comes out, but it makes sence that you need to land that one attack. I guess that would make a difference in long ranged play, so you can't cheese gunshots with free berserker power, maybe? Raids amd fractals you allways on top of the enemy so shouldn't be a problem I think

The Flamewall isn't a moving wall, rather it's a wall that changes it's position by a few degrees every few miliseconds(?). So if you are lucky and get the perfect timing, you can probably even walk through it.
---
The wall that you see ingame is just a texture that doesn't always have a hitbox. If your hitbox doesn't touch the Flamewall's Hitbox, you're fine
---
Idk why you get downvotes. But i love dungeons, and often get new players to do them. I just don't grind Arah daily like some hardcore dungeoneers to know skips. Complete newbies may not know how to do all these but be able to know what's up and can follow the team/team portals are pretty nice. I hope OP still run with new people. Cuz the dungeoneers i know now just solo or duo them and the only dungeons they find "challenging".
---
Anet\_Ben posted a comment saying hitboxes are normalized.
---
I have a friend who likes to do Longbow and Shortbow on his Rangers. I got him to try Soulbeast with Longbow and Greatsword, but he is still warming up to the Greatsword. If he can't get used to that, I plan to suggest Longbow and Axe+Axe/Warhorn instead.
---
Either way, Soulbeast is a pretty direct upgrade to Ranger so any build that works for Ranger should have a Soulbeast version, for the most part. I believe melee weapons like Greatsword, Sword, or Dagger, are preferred for power builds, but weapons like Axes and Longbow aren't so bad they shouldn't be considered. Likewise, Shortbow is good for condi builds and I saw someone else mention running two shortbows to swap between for Sigils/Traits.
---
Yeah, it's a nice system. A bit cumbersome to make a character, use the boost to test and then not using it so you can make a new character since you'll be able to test 9 different professions and you have to remake it each time and do the very, very first story instance on each you make. But it'll take maybe an hour or two to properly test all 9 professions. Though it'll only be base specialisations AFAIK and you won't get all weapons for the class. Keep in mind that weapons mean a lot for how the character plays.
---
When i was Chrono i missed a few cannons because i wanted to go before the wall, but the person with the Bomb wanted to throw after. So I used Distort, walked through the wall but missed the cannon anyway because the bomb was thrown before Distort ran out :/
---
Felt bad
---
Believe it or not but guys like op just use these to practice or to do skip parts that can't be done solo. Watch his stream sometimes he doesn't abuse these.
---
You had me at water whip. Now i want it too.
---
Both can happen.
---
It depends in what state the account is, how long someone has been a customer, what other fiscal damage has been done, and so forth. 
---
If you bought GW2 at launch, slumbered till PoF and now buy a bad key, chances are we might unban you if you work with the customer support team as we try to assist. (We also get users who simply swear at us in hopes that the agent somehow miraculously feels compelled to do as they wish. That is surprisingly ineffective...)
---
If you never played GW2 before, start with a bad key from a bad seller, and we get subsequently hit with the fraudulent charges; then, yes, the account is more likely to just be shuttered without recourse.
---
Please bear in mind that we have very few hard-and-fast rules. We will try to work with folks, because you got defrauded as much as we did in this, but it absolutely can happen an account is terminated without recourse due to this, just as a re-opening with a good code is possible.

For the sake of keeping this list useful, in going to actively exclude any VB matriarch only runs. Not only are most HoT metas for amalgamated fairly well populated already, but the matriarch is perhaps the easiest to find a couple of other people to get it done with.

I feel like sure this is partially true but if you’re camping one element than you’re going to be absolutely useless anyway lol. There’s other benefits of swapping attunements. Ele is one of the most versatile classes in the game but doesn’t play like one anymore cuz it feels like you are either pigeon held to full dps or full heal, so your basically stuck in one attunements now more than ever
---
I personally tend to make sense to no-one, so some is a step up already ;)
---
more serious though, I get it, clarity is helpful, and important when writing anything professional, alas the Internet is a lot of things other than professional and to the OP, his headline made sense.
---
Not everyone proofreads, or gets a layman to read their messages before posting, the jargon made sense in their head, so they hit submit.
---
I do legit runs only in group of people I don't know (pugs in our case) but alone or with friends (or trusted people) I almost always use skips. Also, for obvious reasons I am not going to use skips on stream even with friends/trusted people.
---
This. Amala fight is ok and challenging, but boy I hate most fights in TO, specially, SPECIALLY the last sandbinder.
---
What are the armor pieces being used?
---
It is pretty much the same. You just throw in a few map meta events like Istan and Auric Basin. The player base is more scattered now that they put a daily cap on Istan. If you have alts you can rotate through dense resource node spots like flax, iron, elder wood and do a lazy farm.
---
Basically there is no most efficient farming in the game right now. It was Istan farm a couple months ago but the recent heavy nerfs on Istan made it not more profitable than anything. I would do fractal 42 farm (if you have a good team tho), continue doing sw/Istan or or follow the world boss/meta event chains. But as i said there will be around 1-3 gold per hour difference between these events imo.
---
Thank you! Just bought the Path of Fire expac with 15 bucks with that link
---
You spelled Warrior wrong though
---
OP literally has the best processor for running GW2.  [Benchmarks for single thread performance put it above all others.](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html)
---
I see so it's like I feared then :(
---
I see. Well gotta get to work then... Thanks!
---
Im tempest near main and tbh I avg 19-22k and im still 2 full clears ONLY  for all but W1 and in our training group im 3rd highest dps with 1 2 3 being Weaver Condi rene and a holosmith 
---
IM HAPPY AF with being 4th and not playing 4D piano with rotation
---
Wonder how much those riftstslkers carapaces are gonna jump after the massive farm Nerf...
---
It's also important to remember that a happy customer publicly posting about good interactions with customer service is much less likely than an angry one posting about their complaints.
---
All due respect, though, ANet *does* have something of a deserved reputation for banning without recourse or warning (e.g. the karma exploit that resulted in bans instead of a rollback, or the spyware installation bans that got overturned after outrage).
---
Why?
---
To be honest I don't like it, I am in no way an artist but I feel like it is missing detail especially in the face because her nose and mouth seem non-existent, same goes for her feet. I like the feel of the armor but in general it feels lacking, like effort has been put into it but no soul, that's just my opinion though.
---
My yolo berserker build will love this
---
So from the last time they did no down state, what was the meta?  I seem to remember a lot of pirate shipping last time with my hammer rev, but just want to get something useful
---
So in the announcement it says april 23 and in the patchnotes april 26.
---
No it sounds to me like they are trying to tie black lion stuff to story. None of the items can help you take down a dragon.
---
I never get the confirmation email...already subs newsletter 2 weeks ago.
---
Already tried multi browser, i'm even tried IE, still nothing 😥
---
The episode could drop next week and it would still be relevant... If it appeared on the gemstore saying "prepare to fight Kralk" after the episode dropped, it wouldn't have shocked you, it's just on theme
---
&gt; no one should use catas in a sizable zerg without mastery
---
Yeah, tough call there.  Usually plenty of people who can man catas anyway, siege might could be useful on defense even if you're not capped out on points for whatever you're using
---
*Cries in Daredevil*
---
Its actually a pretty good deal if you count anything individually, if you want all of that stuff anyways its a good deal.
---
They'll definitely do more of this if it sells.
---
Is the timing related to the Episode 6 release? I see no reason to emphasize so much on the "come prepared" slogan other than a precise scheduled release.
---
So you can't get new mounts if you dont buy this whole 2400 gem package? Wow... just let us buy it separately like you did with all previous licenses please.
---
Same here but whenever I refresh the page the newsletters stay enabled so I'm just gonna hope it works.
---
 Ritualist Outfit : I waited for this since ...since day one.
---
I am quite okay with it being opt in through an add on tbhs. PC g👾👽👾😻👾💀😼😽🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾
---
It literally says they're coming separately next week
---
what do you mean they try? they already did.. dragons watch got new fancy armors and weapons. and you could buy them too. 
---
but as long as i dont have to buy it im fine
---
90 second cooldown on Glyph of the Stars. Yeah no.
---
No it doesn't I'm sorry to sound harsh but how the fuck would black lion statuettes or a mount skin help you to defeat Kralkatorrik.
---
Will be interesting to see if Soul Eater is now better than Decimate Defenses for Reaper. At first glance, I'd say Decimate will still net higher damage (full zerkers only puts you at 50% crit chance) due to the need for a higher crit rate. I realize that fury and Death Perception will put you up to 100% while in shroud, but 70% out of shroud is a bit low for a 10% damage boost along with 5% healing (I don't believe this 5% actually acts as a life siphon and therefore it does not act as another 5% increase in damage in addition to the 10%). Certainly a nice change for Reapers that have a hard time staying up though.
---
Are there some kind of free items?
---
Belgium?
---
What no where did I say that its black lion you need to pay gems for it.
---
Elona?
---
This is one of the best updates in a year or more.
---
Yeah, it could definitely be streamlined a little better in a patch. Twilight Oasis is pretty good that way in having lots of optional story but none that you have to sit around and wait for.
---
Just google "money laundering", that should solve anything you dont understand about what he explained.
---
lol someone's gettin' sacked.
---
That was Anets wording, not mine.
---
I would like them to balance that way again.
---
Yeah same, i just checked 30 min ago, the newsletter still on.
---
Thanks! This is good info
---
The thing you are saying has a ton of flaws has a name. What Dovahbear is describing is literally money laundering.
---
In fact, G2A specifically had a big issue just last year with an enormous number of stolen credit cards (&gt; 20,000) being used to move Clash of Clans microtransaction currency on G2G in a fairly large-scale money laundering system based on exactly the premise he is stating.
---
I agree mostly; I'll share this with some people that are starting out.
---
I would spend 1 point each in both build/supply mastery first after getting gliding though. It's a small investment but a great improvement in QoL.
---
I also would not prioritize maxing siege master first. That just makes you mediocre at everything while WvW always demands specialists. For example, you'lre just going to get booted off the ram if they see you lack those skills. Also without siege bunker, you're going to have a time surviving that arrow cart spam as well.
---
I would pick siege ram or catapult mastery first. It's also more beneficial to yourself should you want to initiate an attack and just want to ask a few people around you to attack a tower. As for ram vs catapult; Catapults are generally more common while rams are much simpler to learn. 
---
Also, I'd just like to give a shout out to burning oil mastery. While not a priority, I think it's a bit underrated since you can foil attacks single handedly if the enemy is very negligent. It's not going to always come into play, but it's very funny and highly rewarding when it does matter. Personally, I'm sorta allergic to most siege, so YMMV.
---
WTF! 
---
No necro axe 5% buff? xD
---
I just tested in the training area: Glyph of the Stars is not affected by quickness.
---
not again...
---
??
---
I don't see anything about mystic coins or their value in the patch notes.
---
Then don't buy it. Why does it bother you so much?
---
Only after attack, after a regular dismount it's 2.5 or something.
---
Literally just came out, so I can't try it out until I'm home from work. It looks promising and fun but I'll reserve judgement
---
There is something about Snuggler's expression that makes me think it is shouting"u wot m8!?" xD
---
Love the art though!
---
yes
---
problem, it has mount licences and no option to get something else instead if you got all those mounts when they came out :(
---
Same I'm working for 3 more hours, I still need to even unlock the spec. Embarrassing that I haven't but can you blame me 😂
---
If you participated in the assault you don't actually need to be in the circle to get the reward of the capture anyway.
---
Yes. They also made daredevil more sustainy with healing traits.
---
&gt; Salvaged rare Elonian weapons will now have the same chance of granting Globs of Ectoplasm as other rare items of the same level.
---
They didn't forget!
---
I read the whole patch note and didn’t see any mention about it. Also read the blog but didn’t notice the statement font size 8 at the bottom. Mistakes happen, no need to be confrontational.

So one might say a Flux?
---
Nobody mentions Herald, but I actually prefer it over Renegade
---
I crit a full zerk reaper for 22,000 before with Rampage Rock Toss before the Peak Performance/Magebane Tether nerf. Had full 25 stacks of might and PP going. But up until that point I have never seen it crit for more than 10k.
---
Zerk reapers just seem squishier than they should be.
---
Had no problems
---
I think you need to get out more to be honest..
---
Yeah cause maybe you haven't seen any trailers since the dawn of LWS3 maybe. They always ALWAYS deliver a trailer of the upcoming episode during their usually patch drop day, on a tuesday. Usually it is a week prior to the actuall release, other times it may be 2 week prior, if a Hailstorm happebes or if they are unsatisfied with the product and need one more week to give us a better experience (and they have some good standards after the "Moon-ish Fortress" release, which was 3 episodes ago) :)
---
Just like Anet wants. They’re making sure no farm is too profitable so that it encourages players to spend more money. Almost like they are a business or something.
---
Not at all, I got back into the game after PoF and Berserker never held any appeal. I unlocked it but even giving it a shot, Spellbreaker is way more fun for the modes I enjoy. Hoping this might make Berserker more engaging though.
---
Because he lacks BDE.
---
BIG DICK ENERGY
---
Mine is 5 seconds just hopping on and off out of combat.
---
Seems like mount licenses are what make up most of the price. And with inevitable new skins/licences that will cover the upcoming skyscale, I will personally wait for these.
---
Still, is the pricing worth it?
---
yeah, I was more thinking about those circles I reach in panic when everything is dead already :)
---
And yet the company stands. You think such a big number of credit cards stolen would actually pass by and nobody would do something. Ffs if they would've really done this it would be on all news for months. 
---
Yeah, right.
---
Having an alternative solution without the black lion keys would be a way to let people from belgium access this kind of content
---
Okay you made me chuckle, thanks for that lol
---
Lawl
---
I confirm that observation.
---
when the url says starting today... i bet the patch notes are wrong
---
but can it summon ghosts?
---
Was waiting for this, thank you so much for a timely post!!
---
Mine looks like this too, but I'm based in the UK. Hopefully support can get it sorted for me soon.
---
I'd rather have a sub than the cancer that is lootboxes. That's been my main complaint about FTP as a whole for years. GW2 is thankfully on the low end of forcibly shoving them in but I'd rather they be gone entirely and other direct payment methods instituted, like that old fashioned thing called a subscription, instead.
---
My first thought was it looks like a guild wars interpretation of a raging barbarian from DnD 5e. Thematically I really like, but I will have to wait until I get home to  see if it is fun to play. Also no idea how the adrenaline changes are going to work out.
---
Except there is new mount skins and no other way of purchasing them.
---
Maybe I worded it wrong. There is nothing wrong with wanting to find the best price and enjoying your time off, but if you’re considering doing it in a shady way that involves potential theft from developers, then you should be rethinking things
---
Nah, that healing traits always been there. Actually, it reduced the sustain by forcing you to choose between it and the damage reduction you previously had on weakening strikes (not that anyone ever chose it) or Brawlers Fortitude. Before it was a minor rune that you always had.
---
World Boss event looks very promising!
---
The episode 4 trailer for season 4 released on a Wednesday, the episode 5 trailer released on a Wednesday.
---
Yup, my bad.
---
Flamewall hitbox can't be evaded, it can be only invulned. He just never touched the hitbox, just due to how it is coded.
---
Well they clearly don't want your money, so it's np if you don't feel like spending anything.
---
Well, the exotic breeds mounts are new, right? I think the idea is you can pick that if you already have all the other ones.
---
Is it that bad? D:
---
necro warhorn and focus have been destroyed now. both of their skills aren't direct dmg anymore, just life steal, so it cannot crit. 
---
the new 10% modifier trait is good for fractals, you can just swap runes to Eagle and maybe add some precision infusions to cap 100% crit, but for raids you would also have to add assassin's gear, accuracy sigil, maybe precision food - kinda losing more dmg than the 10% modifier you get (but i might be wrong, someone can count the effective power if they care).
---

---
The headbutt + outrage combo in berserker mode looks great, but its really annoying that someone in your party giving you stability can seriously fuck up your rotation.  I appreciate they are trying to reward using outrage effectively, however teammates hurting your dps is something they've tried to remove (example: changing the dodge trait so vigour isn't bad).  My suggestion would be make it so headbutt gives extra duration increase if it consumes a stack of stability, this way it can also combo with shattering blow.
---
[See this post for pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bgi49a/ancient_rituals_and_valuable_supplies_in_the_gem/ell0rjk/)
---
Yes. Using the same buffs Snowcrows used in their most recend benchmark videos, i only get a meager 31.2k on average, dropping as low as ~29.3k midfight until Executioner kicks in. But Power D/D DE isn't that much better for some reason at around 32k for me. No Thieves Guild in both cases.
---
So the daredevil is effectively a "close" range fighter with the change. I guess it's to seperate it from dead-eye, because with 1500 range on crouch, you're already doing damage while the Daredevil still has a ways to go before they can start doing damage. Thematically, I'm OK with it.
---
Imagine removing a skill like Glyph of Empowerment for being "too passive" and then adding this to the game.
---
sup with arenanet? sup with you?
---
You know damn well what a "loli" is, and you should know damn well the consequences of discussing such topics in public places.
---
It's not that bad of a nerf. Did ~30k dps without food on golem.
---
I could have seen the new legendary greatsword being branded themed but now, not so much. That Branded weapon set looks great though.
---
i thought about that! but garmfield is a better sounding joke name and he's the main pet so i went with him
---
Move house
---
It's expected. At least they're focused on GW2 now. They have to be, the very survival of ANet depends upon it.
---
The preview video for season 6 was not included, also I can not find build templates
---
.....Again you tell me where it states the only loli there is a child? And holy shit did u even read what i said.. -\_-
---
&gt;You 9900k is a powerful chip, but if it's at stock speeds the single core clock speed is not going to be enough to get the best performance on this single thread game.
---
The 9900k stock dual core turbo is 5GHz. No chip on the market has higher.
---
I think its not only the keys but the mount licenses that arent allowed in Belgium
---
Even bigger group, as the only safety against gankers squads was numbers. It's a gift to ambush classes, slightly negated by the presence of mounts (though one full rapid fire from soulbeast will kill off your mount in under 3 seconds). 
---
Technically we have that no down state now with people insta finished with the mount though.
---
Also I guess re-mounting silently got doubled in length (5s instead of 2.5?)
---
A lot of ISPs have data caps, unfortunately, and when people live with more than just themselves and maybe one other person, data becomes a precious resource
---
The whole point is to give elite specs thematic benefits and drawbacks do they are not straight upgrades to core.
---
:distant sirens:
---
To help gear up for war with Kralkatorrik, using this item enrolls your account to receive a piece of legendary gear every day between now and mid-May. Spread out over 28 days you will receive 6x one piece of legendary armor, the legendary accessory Aurora, the new legendary ring Coalescence that will be obtainable through gameplay later this year, a choice of one of the legendary backpacks and 19 legendary weapons.
---
LMAO i'll see about it if i can combine their names funny!
---
holy shit this seems like a great deal for 2400 though.  don't mount selection licenses normally go for like 600?
---
gtfo
---
bUt sHe Is 800 yEarS oLd
---
The boons are pulsing 7 times and the duration that is listed in the tooltip is the total duration, not from each pulse.
---
Only 8000 gems!!
---
In a different world...
---
People had data caps back then?
---
I never had caps, just low bandwidth.
---
The War Eternal Supply Drop, is this like a weekly subscription thing you can take? By the description that is what it seems to be.
---
Wow, this is dumb. Get👏 a 👏 life.

Lmao

How far did that get you?
---
Girl bye
---
they won't. it will be just a playthrough, but still worth watching, though.
---
be careful what you wish for

Thank you!
---
Imagine how bad lw5 will be. And they will callit expansion worth
---
They told us build templates were coming 5+ years ago so.....
---
Yes  100%, instead of you ignorant fuck bois flaming look at the bigger picture wtf :'D
---
Before today it would see some play in SPvP tons of play in roaming WvW, and a decent amount of play in Raiding.
---
If these changes really hurt its play in all game modes well then they should find some other way to make it more competitive in those situations.
---
Now tell us that they aren't underage because they're "just drawings."
---
Thread removed: Do not use this subreddit to try and contact the customer support.
---
Doesn't matter if they are or aren't actually children. You know damn well what lolis imply as a concept. There is nothing wrong with Anet banning your ass. You need help. Child or not, being attracted to loli because of their "childlike" qualities is still just as bad. Why? Because you're sexually attracted to them for again their "childlike" qualities.
---
I think that discounted they go for like 720 gems.
---
About the deal itself, I am personally not interested in most of the times so if I wanted a specific mount I would get the license and be over with it.
---
Is the 600 range still usable in stuff like raids and fractals?
---
Disgusting
---
Love it! Did you make it? If so, do you have a website or anything else I could take a look at? :)
---
Bobblehead tonic

Forgive my ignorance as I’ve only recently begun playing.
---
I’m assuming Tempest is an elite specialization? If it  is, which class is it for?
---
It sounds super cool. I might use my second character slot for it...
---
In PvP, there is no reason to ever play Daredevil. Youre better off sticking to core now in every single case. In PvE, its a significant nerf, but I guess youll still be good for the stolen skills?
---
I use my mobile transfer as a router for my laptop and it does indeed have limited transfer,  kid.

A key is a key. Where you bought the key makes no difference if its from one of the approved sellers.
---
Not everyone is as bright and enlightened as you are.
---
or wife
---
I got really excited reading that one, but the orchid is just alluding to the pink/green color scheme. :(
---
It's not really plant-themed. No leaves, vines, flowers, etc. Just spotted and purple/green for base colors.
---
Which, as much as I want plant mounts, I *just* got the Hummingbird skin for Skimmer soooo I personally want a small break before swapping all my Sylvari yet again lol
---
Took you long enough to copy the hyper-successful bundle model that's been around for years.
---
The value is still far too off, but it's a step in the right direction.
---
I'm going to asume you're a troll, since you can't be that much of a dense weeb neckbeard to tell me I'm ignorant for you thinking lolis are okay if they're older than the age of consent.
---
Oh so its a 7 second channel with 1 pulse per second.
---
They probably saw quickness making it pulse less and someone unthinkingly fixed it by making quickness not effect it rather than scale the pulse rate.
---
Necros offhand weapon skills (Soul Grasp &amp; Locust Swarm) can't land critical hits. Tested it with reaper and 100% crit chance, they just never crit.
---
I think it's an American thing, honestly.
---
Also a rural thing, I guess. Because mobile plans and whatnot.
---
I mean I didnt expect much from the thief changes, but they clearly didnt even test Swipe. It doesnt work with 2 seperate steal cooldown reduction traits. Including one that is used in pretty much every single sPvP Daredevil build.
---
&gt; Note: Purchases made after week one will receive the supply drops from the previous weeks. Act early for the best discount and earliest possible delivery of your supply drops.
---
Tested it for a bit on the golem with quickness and alacrity and it's really fun and dynamic, you constantly have hard hitting skills available and don't really have to use auto attacks, I like it and I'm exited to see some actual experts find out what we can do with it!
---
For purely "useless" items? Sounds like a really bad VIP model in that case.
---
Sorry didn't see the last part
---
the truth
---
Me too! Cool stuff!
---
Yeah, he’s small but deadly ;)
---
I'd say Decimate Defenses will still be better with Scholar Runes, but Soul Eater will be nice for Reapers that struggle to stay up in fractals. Interested in seeing how Soul Eater stands up to it, though.
---
Once everything had queuing and all you do is stand around cities in queue I lost a lot of interest.
---
B-but the super interesting Thaumanova Fractal! I'll never understand why people wanted that.
---
Glyphe of Empowerment is still selectable in training area
---
Got pics ?
---
...the Skimmer could be dyed to look vaguely mushroom-esque...you know, if this was Minecraft with Mooshrooms but still
---
It is getting the recharge reduction from Lead Attacks but not from Sleight of Hand.
---
Swipe is also failing to recharge from Swindler's Equilibrium procs.
---
SO episode 6 in three weeks. Fcking hell...
---
Sorry, I only and poorly read on the website which made me curious
---
This video helped me a lot: https://reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/azjqdy/gw2_very_long_in_depth_griffon_tutorial/
---
That's a waste with necromancer have spammed 20 condies in just 3 seconds you are dead by the time it finished channeling 😂
---
I think it leans a bit too heavy on the cosmetic without account utility stuff I would really want.
---
Still, I'm debating if I should pick it up or not. I kind of want to send some more support Anet's way and though there isn't really anything in this I particularly want. Then again, I also appreciate it's not exclusive stuff like +1 shared inventory space (beyond cap), an exclusive "booster" effect for this "season" to increase MF or whatever, or stuff along those lines.

Are the Branded Weapons only available from the Supply Drop?
---
Why kormir?
---
Thank you! :) You can find my links above.
---
This has been my gemstore experience for quite some time. Arenanet is not motivated to provide a better solution as this restriction only affects a small fraction of the playerbase and is completely invisible to most other players. Nobody talks about it.
---
The implementation is flawed however as there are reports of false-positives. Many promotion packs are completely unavailable. Aside from key farming the only way to get keys are from rare drops. In almost seven years I've collected fewer than 30 keys though story and drops (not farming).
---
That is what all people on the official forum told anet

---
Eh... I mean, It's probably just a test for a buy-in VIP subscription.  None of that stuff really strikes me as, "I need that."  I'm sure they'll bundle items in later down the line, but so long as they're not exclusives I don't really care.
---
Thanks for proving my point. Exactly why druids may still be used in general by people. Rather than stopping and thinking people prefer riding a train till it dies totally.
---
Druid has not been a good choice for a while now, ask anyone that you copy paste your builds / raid comps from.
---
Noob question , how does one turbo a chip ?
---
In zergs, you'd drop res-related abilities and it's  basically the same but with less margin of error. For the most part if you get caught and walk into a 50 person bomb you are going to insta-die, downed state or not though some negligent commanders have a transfuse/MI team ready to pick them up but not for next week I guess. So I'd imagine people would be more careful, and for the love of God, clear siege!
---
Small scale, you'll be better off dealing with those mediocre gankers that only win because they keep rubbing each other and beat outnumbered foes due to attrition. You'll at least be able to secure some skills there. Being surprise bursted will be much worse, but if you go down vs that, you're going to die anyways and at least mounts help mitigate a lot of that.
---
It didn't appear the vouchers were updated last time they released them.
---
Earth auto does have a use. In Forest of Niflhel, you could use it to attack people on higher terrain since the attack ignores LOS and terrain difference
---
Good advice, I'll keep this in mind. Hopefully can grab the Vabbian Lightpaw and Kournan Bright-Tail with this method!
---
You can skip to the bloodstone shard, but it won't turn red unless you've killed Simin, who won't appear unless you've cleared Grenth, who won't appear unless you've killed Lupi. So even if you do skip to the bloodstone shard, you don't gain any advantage.
---
Earth 1 already has a niche use. It ignores terrain differences and hit enemies unexpectedly
---
That's the thing though... It doesn't really have anything you feel like you "have to buy" - it's all just cosmetic stuff by the looks of it with the exception of week 3 statuettes/bonfire/booster. If anything, the pack is a bit too tame in regards to the need vs want dynamic, especially for newer players who haven't gotten to fashion endgame wants yet.
---
Take a Berserker into PvP. That shit was definitely broken and would just get focused in ranked for an easy 4v5 game
---
If keybinds don't seem to be working, I'd double check them to make sure there is no overlay or issues.  That said, the Griffon is pretty tricky to control. I'd say a good way to practice is to try some of those Griffon Races; I often end up trying to the same maneuver over and over until I finally nail it. Most do involve diving to build speed and rising back up to some extent and the reset to start when you fail is handy to get back to what is usually a high up place.
---
Looks like banner slave will still be the most needed but if you go dps now you wont have go go core for best dps and beserker will be a little bit better power wise
---
Leave it at 1200. 900 is too close.
---
Then adjust PvP separate and stop breaking PvE which most of us play.
---
Most people predominantly play PvE.
---
...how did this ever make it through? this has to be a joke
---
That can be resolved through buffs / nerfs... doesn't need a complete spec rework.
---
It's about a 3% net buff all in on the golem.  Will see how it works in practice.
---
Lol.    
---
Bundle interactions are a different story profession skills.
---
If you try to cast a skill with a cast time as you try to drop a banner the banner animation will complete, no banner will drop but the skill will go on full CD. This does not happen if you use an skill with no cast time.
---
Yes.
---
It's called a trade off. unblockable but you still want it 900 + range.. err noo lol
---
Are you rooted in place while casting or can you move?
---
Power berserker was dead. Nobody played it in serious content because had numerous issues when dealing a really nice damage (as a power class should do). It was deeply inferior in comparison with the condi counterpart. 
---
As a 5 years main warrior this change is the best thing they could do, because condition berserker wasn't the same as the original power berserker.
---
Next week, according to the BL page/article on the website. (foot not at the very bottom, for the exotic license)
---
&gt; Doubtful. I could see a small squad of havoc-raising, all-in Berserkers being decent in zergs to help break up the enemy's front lines. 
---
C'mon man... they would get distance destroyed in 3 seconds.. they are even more glassy than before according to the notes.
---
&gt;So are you playing Open World PvE exclusively?
---
PvE in general including dungeons and fractals.
---
And Druid was similarly impacted. Base Revenant was also impacted. People complained that some Elites and some base classes were stagnant, and well, Berserker fit that bill.
---
Scrapper recently got massive overhauls too. Now it has a renewed interest in places like WvW. Change can be a very good thing.
---
&gt; Skills that destroy missiles will now block missiles instead. This change affects the following skills: 
---
Pretty sure these skills still don't count as blocking anything.
---
&gt;Protector's Strike: This skill now uses full-body animation for the finishing strike, even while the player is moving. The recovery animation is now shortened if an attack is not blocked. If this skill does not block an attack, it fully charges Virtue of Justice.
---
Pretty sure recharging Virtue of Justice doesn't work with this either. ._.
---
Your comment sounds like a chrono main who saw SOI in the patch notes, but like less pessimism.
---
What are the boons it grants?
---
the 2 select licenses are already the 2400 gems you have to pay for the package
---
Undocumented Change: Using Superior Battle Maul (warclaw engage skill) puts a 5 second cooldown on remounting.
---
The 3-years-after-the-fact is because under Colin (When HoT was released) these types of things had almost no priority, and up until recently it seemed Anet was not very focused on it, likely due to other side-projects taking resources. It seems that now they have their eyes on making specs more unique, rather than just core 2.0. The unfortunate streamlining by NCSoft helped in this regard.
---
Worth it for me. Week 1 was already good, star beetle skin, stormcaller griffon skin, 4 exclusive dyes and a rare dye! Definitely got lucky with that one
---
I can honestly see this guy as an enemy a la pocket raptors ;)
---
wouldn't you like to know
---
I dunno, I use the old rotation where you pop a headbutt which filled all adrenaline then pop F2 to go into 'zerker at the beginning, then 3 and 5 etc swap to mace double / axe double or a mix depending.
---
You have your zerg behind you, base Warrior utilities have several damage-negating effects, and you can hold off with activating Berserk. You also opt into the trait that reduces Toughness to increase Power and Condition Damage, so you can build smart and put some more Toughness in than usual and then activate Berserk at proper times to shift your damage scaling. They're only as glassy as the player handling them builds them to be.
---
The ritualist outfit made me log in, the fact that I can't play a ritualist made me log out. (The staff is really snazzy though.)
---
Back to GW1.
---
They have a biweekly release schedule. (very common for programmers.) So it's 2 or 4 weeks.
---
&gt;I use my Power Zerk for PvE roaming. 
---
You could use Shortbow Power Ranger for PvE roaming too, doesn't mean the build was at all useful or relevant. 
---
Also, Outrage breaks you out of stuns. So you know, use that.
---
a 7 second channel that you should be using in CA more than out of CA, which you only get a bit of vigor out of it because everything else you can get on druid already provides perma prot and regen. Yea, not particularly happy with it. I only see it being used in wvw
---
HUT TWO THREE FOUR
---
&gt;Rev 
---
A-net surely got that people love gathering orbs in this game! I don't see a single druid going anywhere from raids anyway, especially from condi fights. Revenant changes didn't strike me as something significant.
---
I get what you are saying but most people don't even give a shit about most of the PoF Specializations and other than a couple, most people loved the HoT specs.
---
Reaper was another needed change and a long asked for. But warrior is different, which is allowing a real power build without messing other spec's mechanics.
---
The price isn't that bad of you add everything up and compare it to individual price of the stuff you get.. Only the mount select licences (2x 1200 gems if I'm not mistaken) are already 2400 gems, the price of the pack.
---
After going over it, if you are interested in the cosmetic items, it's about a savings of 1500 gems vs buying everything individually (looking at stuff you can actually buy from the gem store currently).  Not a bad deal tbh.  Now if it sells like hot cakes and they push it further into bad territory that's a completely different story..
---
BADGER
---
Jon is giving me the weirdest chubby...
---
The Reaper changes make sense for the class. They add to the whole Reaper vibe. How is "casting" for Zerker a zerker like trait?
---
Know what I mean?
---
Hahaha
---
But new power dps shouldn't use mace at all, its primal burst is inferior than the core one at its purpose. This dps is going around axes and GS.
---
It's kind of a nerd credential, like the way everyone knows what FF stands for, what an Ewok is, how to correctly respond to the phrase, "JC, a bomb!", that blue hedgehogs go fast, that plumbers eat mushrooms, that Snape killed Dumbledore and that shouting, "THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS!", is a perfectly reasonable thing to do in response to any form of brainwashing.
---
Gallery of the branded weapons? (for those who can't be in game right now)
---
[Here's a clip of the new Arc Divider (GS Primal Burst)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJfGK_DCcM&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
I actually use Ranger as well. My top three are necro, warrior, ranger. 
---
Ranger was my first main, Warrior became my main later.
---
So... what are belgiumnese people do about this?
---
i might have missed this in previous patches but when did ANet start doing all of this "range is a multiple of 60" stuff?
---
reapers get some GS buffs and trading soul eater's skill recharge for 10% extra dmg from short range with a heal side incentive presents a power version of the curses line condi heal grandmaster trait...it's a better heal than the periodic nature it used to have, paired with blighters boon (for those who don't want reaper's onslaught) it gives a consistent bit of chip healing with all of might reapers can build up in shroud and with cleave.  doesn't really move the needle too much i think but probably makes reaper even more solo pve friendly.
---
loli Sylvari 💜
---
You could always try changing to another key you know is free to see if that makes a difference. If it does, then you probably have overlap with previous keys. If it doesn't, you might be using keys at wrong times or in wrong ways.
---
Well there's a lot of way's you can make that last sand binder a lot easier, aka by skipping most of the add phase getting there without aggro-ing them. If you go where you fight Amala the first time. You can climb the pillars ( a bit tricky the first couple of times) with special action key, to get to the last sandbinder, and it's a lot easier without the adds following you.
---
Agreed. Probably the most wicked looking weapon sets just by how smooth the animations are.. and I'm typically not one for purple. Definitely wanna collect them all!
---
looks tasty
---
Considering I can near on match the old bench with 95%crit, eagle runes, assassins GS, power perc food, no power infusions , and standard raid buffs with a GS only rotation I am sure someone else who is more dedicated and geared better would be able to easily surpass what we have now by a pretty nice margin.
---
Don't you dare.
---
Like they wouldn't do a teaser at the end of a panel talking about the death of their main character? Nah, the possibility is definitely not there you're right.
---
Nobody gives a shit except Mirage, Holosmith, Soulbeast DPS, Regengade and Firebrand, Weaver, Scourge, Deadeye for WvW, and Spellbreaker.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about? Every single PoF spec gets heavy use, probably way more than HoT. You don't have any idea what you're talking about.
---
yes thats the point and now tell me please how this is archieved:
---
- tell me why its a good idea to nerf a build in spvp that got already outclassed by its core counterpart where all 3 core traitlines where so strong that you took them over daredevil
---
- tell me how a thief can be a pointholder because that is what the change intends to do with the thief 
---
- tell me how the daredevil with d/p or any other weaponset would still be a viable option without being outclassed by core because thats what is intended right to BALANCE it not to make it unviable
---
im really inrerested at your well researched answers that will display your knowledge about the thief mechanics and rotaions in spvp and can explain how this was a good idea
---
Exalted animals. Why. My lore immersion.
---
VPN as workaround?
---
aoe targetable (ranger glyph purity of purpose is out the window), 1200 range, 360 radius, water field
---
7 second channel, but you can move. pulse every second, 10 targets, 2 condis removed per pulse, and some heals too (283 minimum - no idea on hp scaling)
---
in CA, healing is 392, 6s prot, 12s vigor, 12s regen. revives downs at 4% per pulse for 18 pulses, boons/healing gets 6 pulses
---
thats from me being lazy reading tooltips and playing with it for 30 seconds
---
Can you bypass this kind of restrictions with a VPN ?
---
yes its about spvp that was never an issue who cares about steal range in pve
---
dont you mean *cry 25% less than you used to*
---
Who's the Thief now?
---
-Anet
---
Don't think there are any other mounts that are that stripe-y.
---
it's a reskin of zephyrite festival gacha box.
---
Big expansive packs are always horrible. Especially if they get more expensive with every item they finally ship.
---
What if you would only like buy one piece of the, until now, non existent/visable items later on? You'll have to buy the whole thing and will be punished for being a more thoughtfull person that doesn't buy things that aren't shown yet.
---
So. What exactly isn't horrible about it?
---
This is why they stated they are gonna miss their 2-3 months (where it was 2 months by the way) schedule this time.
---
Raging Barbarian with a negative Intelligence Score, always one at the table. Now there will always be one in GW2! lol
---
Wow... that's ridiculous.
---
no im saying that there are no builds to go back to there where no new builds introduced and there was just a totally balanced and nearly underperforming build removed from spvp for no valid reason at all unless you tell my why this was a good idea
---
you cannot block or be immune to it (pvp)
---
My [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bgi49a/ancient_rituals_and_valuable_supplies_in_the_gem/ell6d6x/) in this thread here has a breakdown of gem prices for most of the items individually.  I mean it really comes down to the individual, for the most part it's all cosmetic stuff (you do get a couple boosters).  If you are someone who really wants those cosmetics it's a decent deal, saves you about 1500 gems.
---
Its just a fun little roleplaying with Evon Gnashblade and his Black Lion Trading Company. And to be fair it does include an outfit (armor), 3 weapons, and a glider.
---
These aren't mutually exclusive, I play more than my share of fashion wars. It's too bad fashion doesn't have its own panel, so I can see all the wardrobe and dye choices easily, instead of having to go back and forth between nested tabs to track down the completely separate locations for mount skins and mount dyes. Build gets in the way of cosmetics just as much as cosmetics get in the way of build.
---
90% of it is Glyph of Stars channel.
---
Yes, you can get 5 free transmutation charges this week!
---
Well actually, more than having an honest discussion it seems like you just kind of wanted to go... you know... berserk...
---
Can you check if its affected by Slow though?
---
For me it dissapears no matter what if I am in combat. Outside of combat it works normally.
---
Uhh there goes, not in an album or anything tho:

Protection, vigor and regen.
---
My poor (intended Power) Herald is actually being reverted to base Revenant after this change :/
---
Herald always felt like Revenant 2.0 to me, but Renegade was too far a departure from the character I wanted to play. Base Revenant changes look promising.
---
Same here. I really wanted to buy the supply drop requisition until I saw I couldn't because they yet again added dye packs and keys, making it unavaiable from the Belgian players. How hard could it be to just give us an alternative :(
---
Oh man, that Redwall throwback.
---
Not going to use that shit elite. I'm just going to run 5 spirits and cry in the corner.
---
i wouldn't even mind it
---
You learn gliding after finishing HoT prologue and the raptor after the first PoF story mission. You decide if you want to grab them before or after finishing the personal story. My advice would be finish the base game story, watch the Living World s1 recap, grab both glider and raptor then resume with the story, starting with Living world season 2. Other mounts will be unlocked through PoF.
---
For open world builds and tips, [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World) has a decent section dedicated to the subject. Later, for raids/fractals builds, head over to Snowcrows.
---
None of the gemstore items are required. That said, the [Copper fed salvage o matic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Copper-Fed_Salvage-o-Matic) is a must have to clear up inventory on the go. Inventory bag slots and shared slots are nice. Unbreakable gathering tools are also really convenient but try to buy ones with gems in it for better value (that way you can also get other resources while gathering).
---
Grab masteries as you explore the map, it shouldn't be a problem.
---
For fashion wars I don't really have any advice. Your style will be more important than the value of the items you have. [Gw2style](https://gw2style.com/) could give you ideas.
---
Deep stone is horrible imo, just cluttering the screen w visuals
---
yeah, at least before you could still position yourself on edge of boss hitbox to make it bounce max amount of times instead of being wasted on allies. made a small dmg burst. it still desperately needed a rework to be up to 2019 standards, but not this rework, lol.
---
no bugs with my flamethrower scrapper :)
---
I mean it helps to get back to bosses such as sabetha if doing cannons, or dhuum if you have to leave for the bomb mechanic
---
It lost cripple?  I thought it was the same, just faster.  Shows what I get for reading too quick.  
---
Ah well, the normal but without our +5% axe damage boost then.
---
Disagree, sometimes it can take years for the effect to take
---
I highly encourage you to deal this with support probably
---
"I hang around in subreddits badmouthing games that I think are shit." ~/u/Vector____
---
Now that's just absurd. A narrative focused MMO can and absolutely does work. The problem I feel is that most MMOs struggle to allow the player a sense of agency in the plot while still telling a story the way they want it to.
---
GW2 is special in that it not only gives the player choice, at least early on, but it gives an established character to the Commander as opposed to the pure blank slate most MMOs have. They get to have a character they can work into the plot somewhat seamlessly and get to let the player fill in the blanks that account for player agency; personal stories, character customization, etc.
---
All the classes and game play elements are reinforced heavily in the lore. Revenant's whole schtick is using previous Lore characters and their abilities. I'd say the biggest gameplay/story segregation honestly comes from meta events, where they're constantly repeatable despite your character personally having dealt with their issues.
---
i think so yeah the outfit ticket already is worth 700 gems also and you can choose between all of them (even the new one) and the other stuff is still around 1000-1500 worth if you dont count the mount license i think
---
There is currently a bug with banners. If you queue any other skill while the banner is casting, it will disappear and go on cooldown. And yes, that does include auto attacks.
---
It's a BadgerBunny, and I love me some War Badgers and War Bunnies.
---
same...
---
Feels really good. Theres some downtime between berserkers, but the burst is nutty and lasts 15 sec (if you take that trait). I was playing axe/axe and I felt pretty strong. I haven't golem tested or anything, but I'm doing quite a bit more DPS than I was as spellbreaker and power BS (obviously) and I don't think I was running and optimal build by any means.
---
My DPS was comparable to my Soulbeast a few months ago pre nerf in the fractals I messed around in. Survivability was low but I think that's kind of the point, and I was having way too much fun seeing all those big numbers pop up with Decapitate, Axe 2, 4, 5.
---
1. You earn the mounts over the course of the Path of Fire expansion story. 3 are required, the raptor, skimmer and Springer. Can't miss them. The other two, Jackal and Griffon, are optional (with the former being much more simple to obtain.) They offer unique ways to get around the map, and some exploration areas are behind areas that need them. 
---
2. There are a boatload of skins that aren't behind gem gates. Ascended and legendary crafting are time consuming, but you don't have to spend money to do them at all. There are some you earn through small quests, from running dungeons or raids, from pvp. There's tons of ways to earn skins and it's really a matter of what you think looks cool. 
---
3. Correct, gliding is behind the Heart of Thorns expansion. You earn it in the same way as mounts, over the course of the story through the mastery system. 
---
4. You mostly just earn mastery points by doing various achievements and objectives. For example completing story steps, climbing up to vistas with small puzzles to get to them. Things like that. You can find them in your achievement tab marked by the coloured stars (red for core tyria, green for heart of Thorns, and pink/purple for path of fire.) You need to earn experience in a particular tree to spend points there, which can be done through just playing the game normally. 
---
5. The infinite salvage tools are amazingly convenient. Slap one of those in an account slot and you never have to worry about salvage kits again. The gathering tools are also nice, but I'd wait for them to go on sale before picking them up. 
---
6. Honestly I wouldn't worry to much about it. It's hard to have a bad build in the open world. Just don't pull a huge group and expect to survive on your own haha. There's websites like metabattle that are great resources if you're looking for direction on how to build your class. Just experiment and see what works for you. I would say maybe start over from the beginning to get your bearings again, depending on how long your break has been. Lots has changed recently.
---
7. I believe this Reddit has a guild recruitment page, or you can leave lurk around populated maps. People often shout guild ads on map chat and you might find something you like there. 
---
Also, you won't need to worry about crafting armour for pvp. WvW yes, but pvp has normalised stats and you can change your build anytime through the build manager in the pvp lobby.
---
Since I'm an altoholic I've got a crap ton of characters hitting their 1 year birthdays today. Is there anything I can do with the extra Queen Jenna miniatures that I'm receiving besides destroy them?
---
Game*
---
&gt; Pretty sure recharging Virtue of Justice doesn't work with this either. ._.
---
I tested it because I was confused about the wording. Not blocking an attack with Mace3 instantly *charges* your *passive* F1, meaning your next strike will inflict burn. Its pretty underwhelming, and honestly I'm scratching my head has to why ? If I'm playing with Mace (a.k.a. the healing weapon), why would I care about a measly 2s Burn
---
i like this idea a lot, they should bring this offer again in the future
---
&gt; This is why they stated they are gonna miss their 2-3 months (where it was 2 months by the way) schedule **this time.**
---
It's just another time. season 4 is constantly delayed :)
---
you can hide outfit  hood
---
... is a vote for uncomfortable looking underboob shirt...?
---
(seriously, I hate that shirt. I get why people like it, I guess it's arguably sexy, but every time I see it I'm just like "god that looks uncomfortable"0
---
(like if I'm gonna wear a sexy fantasy shirt I'd at least prefer the halter top look of the light Carapace armor, for instance, instead of... weird goddamn underboob)
---
So it's four weekly chests for four weeks = 16 chests, right?
---
No reason ANet can't offer slightly altered versions of stuff like the Ritualist Package in those countries.
---
Can't move. If you move, it interrupts the skill and still puts it on full cooldown, lol.
---
They were always strong at healing. Just not when everyone spreads out. But then you still have the 1k/s regen ticks...
---
You don't necessarily need chrono for boon support. In fractals, a lot of groups are now running fb/ren over chrono, and you already have both of those. The power fb even shares gear with your dh.
---
I’ll cry with you...wait gimme 7 seconds, I’m channeling.
---
Yes, a viable option would be to replace the random dye packs with dye selection packs or maybe crafting materials to make a dye. Probably limit the selection though so it isn't clearly superior to the RNG version. 
---
And the keys can be replaced with statuettes, which means you don't get access to everything in the chests but still have some value.
---
I think once larger markets start adopting anti-lootbox legislation ANET and other gaming companies will pursue these alternatives. For now, though, they only lose a small fraction of their consumers while continuing to make big bucks elsewhere.
---
The ritualist outift sounds interesting. I can't get in the game for a while, is there anyone with a screenshot? Or just saying if it looks like one of the GW1 armor sets?
---
Well he isn't wrong, it is a fourth wall break
---
no worries sind, you still can get chak egg sac legit after this patch
---
first i though this was an insta outfit buy but previewing it gave me more of a whatever feel
---
I...I need this as a Mini...
---
TIL today is 3 days from now.
---
Eir: "Where's my bow?"
---
Garm: *Has bow in mouth.*
---
*Studio audience erupts in a deafening-laughter, shattering windows and rupturing eardrums.*
---
If only that ritualist outfit gave the same attack/casting animations as the GW1 ritualist. That's probably one of the things I miss the most from the 1 to 2 transition (well, the whole profession, but meh)
---
It really is. It's like the horribly opposite of chronojail.
---
thoughts on the new druid elite? to me it seems like a good condi counter, not too much need for that. the CA effect seems like its not bad but very inconsistant?
---
im talking pve here
---
I'm a little confused with how the package is described.
---
Do you get a random mount AND a selected mount?
---
Or just one?
---
I didn't see this one up on your Artstation, but followed anyway lol. :3
---
*garm kicks braham off a table and reality collapses*
---
If it's blocked in your country try adding 0 before imgur like this:  [https://i.0imgur.com/cYFTL5f.png](https://i.imgur.com/cYFTL5f.png)
---
Lol, thank you.
---
Just replace and press install again.
---
Ahh noooo I thought the daily limit was already per-account, I could have farmed so many more satchels if I'd paid more attention.
---
That's actually very good, if more countries do that, companies will need to actually offer something good and not RNG crap.
---
Tyvm
---
Belgian is the word you’re looking for.
---
Brahamal?  hmmmm
---
yea, but at least you can cast it as you exit CA so you do might stacking then pop it near the end of stacking and then quickdraw wh5. but that wont likely happen cause you want run it anyhow :)
---
Thank You! So it sounds like crafting one of these weapons is gonna take longer than expected! haha
---
None of the images show for me.
---
Is there a current problem with Imgur, or is it just me? 
---
I use ublock.
---
Since it's a situational skill you will not this as part of a rotation, if at all :)
---
Oh never knew this! Yes it is unfortunately blocked in my country, and for some reason Opera VPN is down so I was unable to access imgur.
---
Lol makes sense considering their Thief balance
---
'There are people dying in Africa' is never a good argument. It's just dismissive. People can care about not than one thing at once. There's nothing wrong with tackling this issue.
---
Have you turned down character models and other graphics options?
---
Even better in my opinion!
---
New Power Berserker feels great. Thank you, devs!
---
Just because they added an unnecessary and often redundant tradeoff it doesn't mean it's actually fair or balanced.
---
Was it intended for locust swarm to lose cripple? It wasn't listed in the patch notes.
---
Arc divider in PvP is even tastier
---
it's not "7 seconds until effect" it's "7 seconds in which the effect takes place"
---
I can agree with this but I think twice a year for SAB would be nice. It does have a history with coming around the fall time.
---
Lol, half of the things i dont know what you are talking about. It sounds hilarious though, give me some of your drugs plis
---
/u/Dornsinger is there a workaround or will you provide alternative packs (= replace the RNG items with non-RNG items) for us in the future? I was going to bug support about this but I might as well ask it here so others could benefit from the answer.
---
Folks had been posting about that in chat since day one. For anyone doing the event it was common knowledge.
---
When I first started playing Necro, I tried for a lifesteal build.  The numbers just aren't there.  Long ago, I played as a necro in EQ1 and the whole game there was to steal life as you bled out (life converted into mana).
---
I'm interested in this. will it work?
---
I did that shortly after posting this question actually and it helped a lot. On a side note, is there any way to turn down skill effects?
---
What is the Bonus Box of Goods?
---
Thing is veteran players / return customers to the gemstore already have all the account utility stuff, and adding too much more pushes in to P2W territory.
---
If you are going to be doing Fractals and Raids I really really recommend Power Dragonhunter. It's quite a bit better than Power Soulbeast in both. And like /u/Shezestriakus said, it's 99% the same gear as a Hybrid Firebrand. Only difference is an Axe instead of Scepter.
---
oh damn, i couldnt find a wiki entry for exotic breeds and picked another, so i missed out on the badger mount, i would have picked that for sure.
---
GW2 is just about gambling in the gem store rather than actually playing it anymore, how sad.
---
Kratos.
---
Excellent! Thank you for helping a nub haha.
---
Lifesteal can't crit, that's just how it is. If the skill isn't 100% lifesteal then there's a problem.
---
Maybe write a post to anet about it? I just added information :)
---
&gt; Physical Supremacy: This trait now causes Steal to become Swipe, which reduces the range from 1,200 to 600 and makes the attack unblockable.
---
Jesus. What are the balance team on? Playing daredevil doesn't necessarily mean you have damage or CC on steal.
---
&gt;Repeater: Initiative cost of this skill has been reduced from 4 to 2 in all game modes.
---
And a straight buff to brain dead spam builds? They have no idea how to balance this class.
---
this is stupid, still no new warclaw skins
---
I'm not sure how I feel about it. I didn't actually get much use out if the original range before hand, outside if a few initiations. I was playing staff Daredevil anyways so I already wanted to stay within close range. 
---
I can't get a feel for deadeye though and I need that mobility so I think Ill get used to the changes and keeo playing my spearshanking mushroomhead.
---
In PvE DD got a buff afaik, wut?
---
Yeah, roflcrit builds are going to reign supreme again. That or ultra bunkers.
---
There was zero reason not to go anything but 2-3-3 for reaper in PvE (and maybe even pcp, not as familiar). Now you have a legit competitor—I think it is better, but I’m sure there is legit argument to stay dec defense. The game needs more traits that truly compete with each other and make the player choose. Look no further than the same trait line for why; why would any PvE reaper take anything but the 3 skill in GM, it is miles more useful than the other two skills (one being a remnant from when condi reaper was a thing that they phased out but didn’t replace trait wise)?
---
Same for me, got really excited when it was datamined.
---
Previewed it on most of my characters and i don't know why but it just wouldn't work with any of them.
---
I only have 3 items left in the armor unlock category, all gem store items, worth 400 and 500 gems and then the enchanted crown package worth 500 gems, seems odd you would only get the 1 skin.
---
Armor sets had the same problem when they went in, icon for the armor chest piece but not the whole set, they ended up patching it. Wondered if something similar happened here. 
---
Might as well just buy the set as it's been confirmed it's just the 1 skin.
---
I *think* they drop, but it's probably as rare as getting a precursor. Black lion chests for days though.
---
McDonalds is a little bit better than Silverwastes.
---
Fractals: Daredevil is probably better, but Reaper isn't that much worse.   
---
Raids: Daredevil and Deadeye are significantly better than any Necro specs in the damage role. Scourges offer some support roles in adds heavy condi fights such as Souless Horror and Mursaat Overseer.   
---
Open world: I prefer Reaper as you can solo quite a lot more content as a Reaper than any Thief spec.
---
Without actually playing the game to unlock the mounts, gambling for the skins is pretty obsolete, so not sure what you are on about.
---
All dyes from the dye packs can be bought on the trading post without any gambling either.
---
I honestly have no idea what f2p players are restricted on across the game as I have never played on a f2p account. I've been playing since launch on a b2p account.
---
I got over 8k
---
Aw thanks
---
Thought I can have some free equipment for my second character that just got to lv80, thanks anyway!
---
I did 29k with food
---
It really isn't that helpful without an explanation of why
---
This thing is so fucking dumb, i have to use a vpn to buy something on the bltc. I have a job, i never use more than 20€/months in this game, but i can't buy what i want without a god damned vpn
---
It got a, I believe roughly 2% buff if you play dodgeless (as in, you play without enough endurance to ever dodge outside of your rotation). Which of course, you cant really do. The big problem with the dodge-based Rifle builds (And the reason why, despite very high DPS, they were deemed unplayable), was that you couldnt dodge. So instead youll have to play with a minimum of one dodge roll available. Thats already a DPS loss. If you play it like right now, with 2 available to actually be reasonably safe, its a major DPS loss.
---
wow sounds like fun content buying stuff from the market place
---
/r/charactercrossovers shall adore this piece!
---
ahh gotcha. yeah I just posted this for the people trying to claim he used stealth or something and this wasn't "proof" I was like no...I was there lol
---
Nope, none.
---
the most important advice i can give you would be
---
avoid crushing head first into walls 
---
Honestly tho that would reduce your speed too much
---
Do you think the supply drop can be gifted? :S
---
Awesome thanks for this!  You have the stories broken down in order.  To get to mounts should I skip to living story 4 and then go back to Personal story and continue on, or just progress naturally?
---
Perhaps you shouldn't be confused when you mention a private bet between two people on a public forum, and people don't understand what you're talking about.
---
No. I was on Tangled Depths last night and ran into an HP. There are people who run them weekly still I believe . Just hang out in the map or search lfg every few hours and you'll run into one. They're quite common for HoT maps if you don't pay attention. If you go around looking for one it might feel impatient and slow but I'd just play casually in the maps and wait to stumble upon one
---
I still have permanent button for both of them :P a very low res side-floating reminder of the election past :)
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
The bug report forums would probably be better.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/categories/bugs%3A-game-forum-website
---
Thanks for this!
---
Why so angry?
---
I am confused about the purpose of this build. What's it for? It's got Power dps stats, Condi dps stats, and Healing stats.
---
I like the non glowing cabbage looking aesthetic tbh
---
I've submitted a report in game as well, but I though visibility could help, I know Ben is out here somewhere ;)
---
The new  earth dagger 3 skills on elementalist Earthen Rush, is a leap finisher. Meaning it should create aura when used through specific fields, in combination with the Powerful Aura trait, these aura's should be shared to your closest teammates. This has always been the case, it has always worked with Magnetic Leap (old dagger 3). However, upon some testing, this skill does not share fire aura when the player leaps through a fire field. It does however share light, dark, ice, and chaos auras when the respective field is leaped through, leading me to believe there is just a bug with fire fields and Earthen Rush's interaction. 
---
Pls fix :D Thank you ^^
---
Edit* 
---
Fire aura doesn’t share at all, even with focus 5 skill
---
[Now where could my bow be?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAh9oLs67Cw)
---
My recommendation is always to go in order, it allows you to enjoy content more since certain map masteries feel somewhat useless if you have mounts already (as they were designed without mounts in mind). However if you want to skip to get to get mounts as early as possible that is fine too, it’s really up to you.
---
Channel tears for 7 seconds (unaffected by quickness) every 90 seconds.
---
And?  That doesn't change the fact that the dye packs are lootboxes.  The prices of those dyes on the TP are reflective of that.  So their gemstore cost is still being passed on through the TP.
---
... or whines.
---
Question,  how did you get you mouse to become blue?
---
You seem to be 1k short

*Laughs in anything but thief*

Can't wait for Garmfield without Garmfield.

Over the past 4 weeks, they gave out the last 4 LS episodes for free to players who havent unlocked them yet.

With or without banners?

Yes I did thank you
---
what good is that for older players? Day by day more players in my guild quit
---
It's not Menzies, his bro?
---
What trash tier bait. Good God, man. How do you look at yourself in the mirror every day?
---
There's nothing in the patch notes that says it no longer cripples, not sure what the other guy is on about, although it's possible that they accidentally left it out. Also, I'm pretty sure the Death Spiral changes are actually a net buff, in PvE at any rate - it's gone from dealing 50% more damage for half the fight to dealing 28% more all the time, which means it will do slightly more damage per use on average with less of it front-loaded.
---
they can come back, once the next episode releases
---
Just because you'd rather spend your money on something else doesn't make the item in question "overpriced". 
---
It's smart to weigh the cost of different things against each other, and against your own resources, before deciding what to buy, yes. But making that choice for yourself and then declaring its value to other people based on *your* standards isn't really fair. 
---
For example, not all of us *want* several new games. I personally already have plenty of Steam games that I haven't even touched, or have barely played, because my gaming time is limited and I choose to spend most of it on GW2. So I get a lot more value out of gemstore items that will bring me enjoyment than I would out of buying a few more games that I probably won't play. Other people might not want either of those things, and could rightly say "why should I spend that much on a few new games when I could buy a new book for X amount?". And still others might say "why spend money on a book when I could check one out from the library for free?". Everyone has different wants, needs, and standards.
---
Basically, value is relative.
---
Oh its an interesting topic to talk about. Gambling, individual rights, company economic goals, country laws. And its pertent to this community.
---
But that is not what the OP did.
---
They posted they can't buy things. ANET won't fix it. And nobody is talking about it. They never even said they were in Belgium until people starting guessing about it. They were just bitching. In reading all the suggestions people bring up to help, the OP just shoots it down. Never offers anything interesting to this conversation.
---
I at least tried to point out the population size problem as to why nobody is talking about this, I get downvoted and hidden for being mean.
---
If the OP would put some effort into this, I would honestly like to hear more information about this topic.
---
The "dickbags" example is not a fair example for "they dont care about criticism". They weren't generally referring to WoW players as dickbags, they were talking about filtering out tons and tons of responses, some of which are going to be from actual dickbags because the WoW community is huge.  
---
A bunch of the responses in https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2435669-Why-are-Blizzard-Employees-Allowed-To-Talk-Like-This illustrate why the "dickbags" thing is nothing wrong and cant be taken as just some dismissal of the community at large:
---
"I don't see anything wrong with this. He didn't call anyone out directly here and didn't say anything out of line. Stating that he blocks trolls isn't inappropriate. Sounds like you are just overly sensitive. "
---
"Pro tip: the vocal portion of the WoW community are anonymous dickbags. Fuck’em and the horse they rode in on."
---
"Personally, I don't have a problem with him venting on his personal twitter account. The playerbase can be toxic and has driven more than one CM to respond like this *cough Tseric*. Josh at least didn't do this on the official forums using an official account.
---
As for you trying to frame this as an attack on "Wow's paying customers". He clearly singled out those hiding behind anonymity of Twitter to spew bile and vitriol. Fuck those people. "
---
That Brisban Brushtail makes me want a squirrel mount... so close!
---
Feels great but rotation and benchmarking is not going well.
---
If that's the case it's an extremely poor behavior change :p
---
A good way to turn off returning players is to release an unfinished living world episode.
---
That's no official release date of the episode, though. It's just the timeframe for the promotional package, the episode could still come anytime between now and May 21 ... or even later.
---
It says on the page:

&gt;Repeater: Initiative cost of this skill has been reduced from 4 to 2 in all game modes.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;And a straight buff to brain dead spam builds? They have no idea how to balance this class.
---
You know repeater is the skill #3 on the main hand pistol when you have nothing equipped in your off hand. This is not Unload, the #3 skill when you have 2 pistols equipped.
---
People like you are why game companies get away with taking people for a ride.
---
This is a good thing to be honest. Don't want to be distracted during finals.

Reaper? Brain? Are you sure you're talking about gw2?

I've destroyed all of mine lmao

Easily every night (NA)
---
your mom's irrelevant
---
hnggggggg
---
You don't happen to have a guide handy with these routes?
---
Is that a goddamn axe pun
---
No it's not. Repeater is also a dual wield skill.
---
In fact every class could fit ever role. A few can some roles better than other, but in theory you could run a heal warrior. Meta roles could change every balance patch.
---
Real kill proofs would be as simple as adding a "profile summary" page to Raidar that displays a count of completed logs containing you (with you alive at the end). And that'd also be beneficial for the players that raid more than once a week per account.
---
spin 2 win
---

---
You are incorrect.
---
Proof:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Repeater
---
Then the tooltip had to say it is a passive rercharge. But I think putting an burn proc to Mace 3 will be more simple(like "fullcharge mace 3 attacks 2s burn), instead of proc F1 passive. I really have no idea what usefulness is on the effect.
---
Well yeah they do steal health from enemies but it's never stated that these skills won't crit anymore at all in the patch notes. I mean, why would they even do that? Necro has enough sustain already. Why change dps skills to give more sustain and loose dps? If anything, Reaper needs dmg skills more than anything else.
---
It doesn't have to be absolute top dps because it still provides amazing utility through banners. The point is, it's now a viable alternative to cBS zerker and pBS warrior.
---
answers below in already existing threads about the supply drop
---
You seem to be under suffer because a video game doesn't match your expectations. That's ok, but is your fault for continuing damaging yourself with something you know won't make you happy. I'm sure lots of your game friends left already, maybe you should join them and quit the game. And if you need help, or want to cry, we will be there for you with no hard feelings. Otherwise, do it in peace and quiet.
---
the package is an around 60% discount compared to the value of its items. it is a good bundle.  for the skin price, it is pretty much the same price like in all other comparible games
---
It's also more expensive than buying of the expansions.
---
Answer above (prove me wrong)
---
Lol god forbid someone criticises a game on a discussion board
---
awful, i hate it.
---
do more tho
---
As niche as it is, these things not working with swipe makes Daredevil handkiter on Deimos way less viable. I'd grown to love the build as something a touch different so would be nice to have this fixed soon!   
---
~~And it probably impacts people in PvP way more but who cares about that pfft~~
---
the packages all contain RNG items, bl keys and dye kits
---
Honestly an hour of minimum wage part time job is still more gold/hour than most gold farm in game.
---
Alrighty :), didn't see just tuned into gw2 after being away for a few weeks. Also I appreciate your work on pricing and gem store related things.
---
Almost all classes can perform all roles although some are better at particular roles than others and trying to make a thief healer is probably going to be a struggle.
---
The one selling internationally? Countries can put interdiction over companies even if they're overseas you know? But they didnt right?
---
 𝔅𝔞𝔡 𝔤𝔬𝔩𝔢𝔪 𝔟𝔢𝔫𝔠𝔥𝔪𝔞𝔯𝔨. 𝔅𝔞𝔡 𝔠𝔩𝔞𝔰𝔰

Life is good
---
I think the same about every overpriced gimmick in gemstore - I like whales funding my entertainment. Until they start locking up content behind non-expansion paywall, Im gonna accept those shameless acts of greed from anet.
---
Nope
---
Wise people improve from criticism. Stupid people go through lay offs.
---
&gt;because it still provides amazing utility through banners
---
Welllll, actually it doesn't. To ensure you stay in berserker mode as long as possible, you need to bring as many rage skills as possible, which certainly clashes with banners. With all 5 rage skills you can last 100+ seconds in berserker mode, and falling out of berserker mode feels like a gigantic loss now that you don't even have F1 and can't use your utilities because you need to save them to extend berserker duration. So if you take 2 banners, you no longer have enough skill slots for synergies:
---
- if you bring a physical skill - you have less berserker duration + you have nothing to prevent you from getting stunned by Headbutt (Outrage or Shattering Blow)
---
- if you bring a rage skill - you have nothing to trigger Peak Performance trait
---
- if you bring Wild Blow when more cc is needed - you have neither Peak Performance proc, not Headbutt break
---
check that dpi and polling issues, take d912pxy, config it to eat all RAM, enable all MT features and hope for 60+ FPS
---
Also cannot count for capture circles while mounted.
---
I thought the exact same thing ! It was the perfect setup
---
aww, I miss old L.A.
---
LOL.  I don't need to argue with you.  It is enough that you are wrong.
---
Thia change is in the patchnotes.
---
I don’t understand
---
Good things for you but my finals begin may 29th, so not so good for me ^^
---
Subscriptions are usually not retroactive so that is not a good fit.
---
you can try to disable threaded replay via

    [replay]
---
    mt=0
---
and ofc there is some new upates on the way
---
dude Warclaw just came out and it came out with a pack of skins. You are being very unreasonable. You got to give it some time before they crank out some more skins. If you look at their release cycle it goes something like Outfit---weapon set---premium mount skin / or pack ---utility item -----Outfit .
---
power tempest is good. easier to learn than weaver and more reliable spec for new-beginner eles. rotation is easy as well. if you do one thing wrong and you see a huge dps drop for weaver. 
---
i'm so glad tempest healing get buffed now. so hopefully we'll see more of them around.
---
 Everybody just buys the dyes they want off the TP for gold anyway. (2)
---
I really prefer that map
---
or get some rl instead.. this game has shittons of content
---
Much more likely to work like the Immortal weapon set or the Onyx and Gold Lion sets where they are only available through various bundled packages or the black lion statuettes.
---
mhm. and that's irrelevant to whether dye kits are lootboxes are not. if you win the RNG and get one of the rare expensive dyes you can now sell your winnings on the trading post if you so choose. that doesn't make the process leading up to it not a lootbox.
---
I think a random guaranteed reward isn't the same as gambling..
---
Probably semi-permanent based on the other two things right below it on the table. Maybe the return of something like the GW1 bonus weekend(which are now week long) events.
---
Couldn't help but be reminded of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJD1Iwy5lUY&amp;t=46s)
---
Looks like it actually is. Next episode in 4 weeks, yeah! 
---
Ps thanks for downvotes, they change nothing
---
Its not mandatory so its fine.
---
So a leather tunic look?
---
Both licenses in the supply drop are select tho. 1 new one and a choice of all released (+ new) select license
---
scrapper &gt; normal glyph
---
scourge &gt; CA glyph
---
so no niche to fit in
---
tfw you realize that every single exclusive dye in the tradingpost is already paid with real money, since they only get generated through the black lion market.
---
mount is fine, mount with skills and gimmicks is not
---
Stack them all in a throwaway alt and delete him
---
There are still more good changes that they've yet to implement. Check the forums on this.
---
Technically there are some minor rng things in the last week as well the first week delivery. But even with the combined value of week one you will get your gems worth of money. Everything else is additional value. The main selling point are the gem store and bundle unique skins like the onyx-and-gold-weapon-set, the branded-weapon-set and these new exotic mounts skins. You cannot get them anywhere else atm so if you want them you have to buy this season pass lite. Given that the onyx-and-gold-weapon-skins are usally bundled with an outfit (check), five rng colours (check), some black lion keys (check) and a glider skin (check) the whole supply drop is so much more worth for only 400 gems more. At least during the first week.
---
small ass hp pool with heavy armor. if youre in the middle of your zerg you might last more than a second if you have someone shielding/healing you. ill take an hp pool buff over anything else. guard is fine other than low life span
---
Well sounds like I missed something good here while I was failling Dhuum CM xD
---
Things aren't looking as I hoped for Power Berserk with initial testing tho :/
---
Yes
---
In addition to all steal cd traits not working on swipe which I hope is a bug....
---
In the adoption choice box, all the old ones are select, but the new one's an adoption (random).
---
&gt; How do I make myself better at mobs? 1-3 I'm ok, past that and I'm done really quick. Tried greatsword, current on axe and dagger/torch.
---
Have you tried out the condition variant with shortbow and traps?
---
&gt;Also is the bow useless?
---
pretty much
---
&gt;What am I doing wrong?
---
nothing
---
Undocumented change that was planned to be introduced.
---
Fair point you're 100% right. But you really ought to not care so much about a video game, it is unhealthy.
---
They broke all the builds.
---
First they nerfed condi thief, but I said nothing because I didn't play condi thief.
---
Then they nerfed p/p thief, but I said nothing because I didn't play p/p thief.
---
Later they killed d/p thief, but I said nothing because I didn't play d/p thief.
---
Now they nerfed the entire elite spec and no PvP build is left.
---
And disgustingly op for solo play and achievement hunting.
---
Get Vitality? Use active defensives?
---
Guardians will always have a minimum of 11k health. Don’t expect a buff in that area.
---
I really want to see a Fern Hound jackal skin!
---
With Bolas Outbreak and Signet of might , still had banner buffs tho (6 boons 7 buffs)
---
male charr necromancer looks rad if done correctly
---
You can move while channeling the new druid elite.
---
My own chrono (which is me, with also "a few" hours of experience) confirms that you still have the full second of evade even when under quickness. Damage animation and output is affected by quickness but the Blurr effect that is on your bar and makes you evade the attacks still lasts the full duration.
---
Female Sylvari Necromancer  
---
Charr warrior
---
Norn ranger
---
And several others :-)
---
For the same reason the games themselves are. People use stolen cards to buy gem cards (which are a thing you can buy online and in some stores) and resell them on grey markets to launder the money
---
It's definitely the most fun I've experienced. Like the big changes this patch were with the Berserker warrior spec and it's been so much fun looking at my old build and seeing where I can tweak things to make myself more survivable or do more damage.
---
Super excited about the Exalted Raptor.
---
But why did they change that in the first place?
---
I'd highly suggest looking at[ this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) and try to at least get partially geared in correct exotics. Your rotation and skill will matter a lot more than upgrading to ascended (assuming you have the right stat exotics in the first place) but you will eventually need the ascended gear for higher fractals but that's something to work towards.
---
it's 200% wxp gain, 125% reward track points, so you should be leveling twice as fast and finishing reward tracks in 80% of the time.
---
Plus a disabled downstate, which...you may or may not like, but it just means that once you're downed, you're dead
---
My best guess is that Belgium is on EU servers? And that you could barter with someone you know and trust from a different country. Or A-net could just have marketing options that accommodate to regions with restrictions like that. Seems pretty meh tho.
---
Short answer: Nope.
---
Long answer: You may reach it if you lower the character models and details settings and maybe you can get 40\~60 FPS in big events.
---
Nope. It’s not your kit underperforming though. It’s the game. GW2 isn’t well optimised.
---
Yes I don't keep any of these aswell. But if they don't accept envoys herald as Kp then honestly fuck em.
---
I mean Exalted Shoulders and Gloves were the same way.
---
Feels better to play it in pvp. Spellbreaker in boring, berserker is fun.
---
You can basically use any weapon/skill combination you like. However, there are combinations that work better / are more powerful than others. Now it depends on which mode you play (wvw, PvP, open world, raids, ...) and if you like efficiency ;-)
---
Even with 1200 range a ranger gets you with their 2k range longbow. 
---
Asides shadowstep and sword skill 2, thieves don’t have much for closing gaps. That’s awful as a melee based class. Can waste all their dodges and initiative to get there, but then they can’t do anything in a fight. 
---
Other then stealth (which I think needs a complete rework, particularly in combat stealth) thieves don’t have much going for them. 
---
I do like the other changes to daredevil, but the steal change is a huge nerf out of no where.
---
I quitted playing pvp because of Mesmers. Cheating class! Easy PVP for Mesmers.
---
I assume it is. Probably will be hotfixed.
---
Wow 5 secs? Yeah I noticed it still gave me adrenaline today while playing, but they said in the patch notes preview that it wouldn't..
---
Unless they meaned only outside of Berserk so we dont fill adrenaline with it?
---
And If it gives 5 secs instead of 2, its wrong as well, they said 2 seconds in the preview
---
wardrobe unlocks are unaffected by what you do or do not have access to. if you are truly worried, i suggest you spend the money you'd invest into this package into the expansion itself instead. you'll get much more value out of that.
---
Queen Jennah's for everyone!
---
It's indeed the first time that a class can get BELOW base toughness.
---
Well, people wanted and pushed for the government to regulate in game purchases. this is the result. not like you could have seen this coming from miles away.
---
Edited the post before I saw your answer. I actually seem to have misread the ingame tooltip a little. I saw 5 seconds, but that was the buff duration of the heal skill and not the increased time. Just looked it up in the API.
---
I'll give this a try asap. Meanwhile keep up good work, d912pxy thing is nothing short of a breakthrough from the benchmarks I've seen.
---
it's a trap!
---
They need to revert the thief changes asap. It's complete, untested garbage.
---
then just buy other games...
---
I've stqrted using my world boss portql a lot more recently as a half-attentionnway to earn some gold. This bonus evejt will be nice.
---
For comparison, how much do you bench with banner axe/axe gs Spellbreaker?
---
Yes please, I bought it anyways just because of the nostalgia since it was my fav class I had to get it. However this little detail really disappoints me. It really looks awfully off and I just don’t get why they did that :o I really hope they can fix that
---
Let’s be honest this is probably how the BLTC ships everything. Those birds can’t lift skritt.
---
I agree, I've complained about that too for a long time
---
Yes. All the freaking time. But I persist to fill the middle of the PvP playerbase.
---
EULALIA!
---
Asura warrior riding this mount is like Martin sitting on Boar's shoulders. :D
---
Already got the Kourna Jackrabbit for a large hare, now I'll just like a griffon skin to pretend to be Skarlath and we're getting closer to full Redwall cosplay in gw2! xD
---
Anet shows once again that they have no idea for the future of thief in any game mode
---
Why wouldn't they drop? You don't pay anet when you get one out of the personal story or random drops. You haven't paid anything to gamble with.
---
If you have the gems lying around and absolutely nothing better to save up for/spent them on and you have a use for all the stuff they send you, then yeah, worth it - individually, the items over those 4 weeks would run more than 3400 gems.
---
If you're thinking about getting something specific from that 4-week list and you don't care about the rest, then just buying that single item is probably a much better idea.
---
And if you think waiting for skyscale skins if worth it, then that's a totally fair approach as well.
---
Personally, i bought the pack because i had the gems (and some extra gold) just lying around, absolutely adore the new mountskins and i was thinking about buying another Outfit soon. And i figure i will have a use for just about all the other stuff as well, so i'm not really making a loss here; It's gems i would've spent anyway.
---
POF is 50% on Nuuvem which is the authorized Brazilian vendor. You can use the keys you receive in NA (not sure your location). I bought both POF and HOT from them this week and had no issues with the keys.
---
Raiding doesn't keep the lights on for any MMO. If you're so bitter over the release cadence of raids, why are you still here posting about how you want the game to die? Also, new customers are everything. You always need people to replace those who take a break or quit.
---
I prefer to put model limit and quality on medium, other way you only see nametags or blank armors if playing on low. But yeah.
---
I tested power spellbreaker and berserker in total solo situations and spellbreaker did around 4-5k more dps than berserker. Reason for this are that you are loosing 21% dmg when staying in berserk for too long and you can't generate perma 25 might/fury with berserker anymore. So for solo play it's sadly pretty trash. I really love the new gs burst tho.
---
This triggered me when uploading icons to the wiki.
---
Crystal Infusion isn't there... noooo..
---
I mean, that makes sense, but oof. 
---
Looks like I will be staying as banner bola spb.
---
The glyph system sucks on druid. The dual nature of druid glyphs means the glyphs only support when you have the powerful celestial support skills, which is when you don't need support glyphs.
---
We need the support effects of glyphs outside of celestial attunement.
---
I know what video that is without even clicking on it.

Don't fuck the salad loli
---
Looks awesome, nice style!
---
That\_shaman's tweet really just focuses on gemstore items that are in the gw.dat, and not really on all releases. It means ArenaNet put into the date enough stuff to cover updates for 3 weeks' time (since ArenaNet does biweekly updates most often).
---
We could still be seeing the release May 7th or 14th.
---
I can confirm.
---
Basi venom?
---
I was thinking about the whole maintaining combat to keep raging part.
---
Healing in GW2 is becoming more of a chore each patch. Ventari tablet was never a fun mechanic, even if it was rewarding and powerful in certain situations.
---
They built an MMO without a trinity and decided they wanted a healer. It was never a natural fit and awkwardly works with the game's combat style to some success, but they keep nerfing and bashing the parts of healing builds that smooth out how unnatural it is to heal in this MMO and healing becomes a chore.
---
this is me too. i have nearly 900 trans charges and i change looks often as well, a few times a month for a lot of chars, or do any sort of holiday looks. 
---
i haven't changed my stats for the longest time. i'm a filthy casual and i think whichever gears work if you know mechanics, and rotations well. it doesn't have to be screaming meta to speed clear. so usually my chars have abundance of trinkets and weapon sets. armors usually the same, can use in wvw and fractals/raids, just switch trinkets and weapons. runes and sigils off meta. it's just it takes more time and efforts to play with builds and test/tweak around till it works best for you. since then, i'd only switch/update traits when balance patches come out, the rest stay the same. 
---
i'd like to see thing separated but it also means we gonna have like what more tabs within hero panel with enough of existing tabs. lol. which idk how to explain but it's kinda fine the way things are. it's weird but it worked.
---
You know it will get worse.
---
I actually play with everything on high. And on medium only both model options and shadows. I get same average FPS than you so... I suppose that lowering more the shadows and the models would improve fps on cities and big fights but doesn´t look the same imo.
---
I will check this
---
You know what they say about assumptions...or...I guess you don't.....
---
Power Zerk doesn't have the management capability to be a bannerslave. As is you're already fighting for Peak Performance uptime as well as banner uptimes, stacking Berserker Mode on top of that isn't very intuitive, which unlike cZerk which already has 3 rage skills as part of its rotation that they can use to keep their duration up.
---
Honestly speaking its more of a direct DPS spec, but right now there's no balance on your resource management that gets you the most bang for your buck. You *might* be able to manage if you've got 2 zerkers sharing the burden of banners, but then it'd make more sense just having a DPS pZerk and having the other just run cBS.
---
That's actually a really interesting staff, and here I am about to start dabbling in Druid now that I've *finally* finished training it.
---
Assuming my reason for playing Druid would ever log on, but that's another story for another post that shouldn't really be made..
---
Keys still drop, they can be awarded from map completion, and they drop from the story steps. Just can't buy them, or any package that contains them.
---
Lootboxes must become a history. They are not fun. It's extra sucking money from people out of their gambling. I wish more countries would go that way so games would stop doing it.
---
I thought the same thing but I figured they didn't do that because it would cost too much time/manpower so I didn't want to ask. :/
---
I can get it on open world fights, but not on big group fights. I play with model quality and limit on medium, shadows medium, other settings on high. Shadows is worth lowering, but IMO lowering the models too low doesn´t look the same.
---
This, ladies and gentlemen (and charrs) of the Subreddit, is what we call "having good RNG".
---
Your math is off. That isnt how probability works.
---
Scenario A: you use the select license first you have a 15/15 or 100% chance of you getting your preferred mount, the. Then you use your adoption license you have a 1/14 or 7.14% chance to get the 2nd most preferred mount
---
Scenario B: you use the adoption license first you have a 1/15 or a 6.67% chance of getting your preferred mount. Then you use your mount select and get a 100% or 14/14 chance to get your 2nd most preferred mount. 
---
2 compute probability of sequential outcomes you multiply the probability of the first outcome by the 2nd.
---
So 
---
Scenario A: 1.00 x .0714 = 7.14% chance of desired outcome
---
Scenario B: .0667 x 1.0 = 6.67% chance of desired outcome
---

Does this include a select for the OG mount adoption license?
---
I’d rather live in a world where adults are allowed to make their own decisions with their own money instead of the government making the decisions for them.
---
It would be pretty nice if the skirt did not look like a carpet or a door mat attached to an actual intriguing exotic outfit.   
---
Also, I am pretty confident they would sell even more if that iconic headpiece was available as a separate head armor skin. I would most certainly grab it. This outfit? Meh...
---
I like downed state and dislike rallying. I wonder if they would do a no rallying weekend.
---
ESO has a good monthly sub model. Gives you the value of gems for the price you pay for a sub (actually slightly better than the value of gems) and gives you the craft bag (access to "deposit all", a core feature of GW2) as well as some passive experience buffs etc. It also gives access to all DLC (so in GW2 that would be Living World releases, which are not free in ESO).
---
ESO's system can't port over well to GW2 (because the craft bag is a core feature and Living World releases are free if you log in during release) but the gem value for the purchase is astronomically better than how GW2 bundles. GW2 bundles are full of junk and useless shit players wouldn't normally buy, and they are used to pad the prices of things you might like in the bundle. This raises the overall gem value of the bundle, but the real value of the bundle to a player is almost always less than the cost in gems.
---
If GW2 did a $15 a month sub that gave $20 in gems (would have to be a cash purchase not a gem purchase) and access to things like a permanent makeover NPC, free waypoints and something like a Black Lion selection box, plenty of people would buy them. Throw in all of the convenience services (bank/tp/repair) for the duration of the sub. Would easily become a very popular sub without harming the no P2W aspect of the game.
---
And make the cake buff last longer too! 30 minutes or more sounds fair.
---
It looks better like it is now..
---
Adults aren't the only people playing these games
---
If it should be held to the same standard as gambling then as an adult you should be able to buy these things from the gem store...
---
You said it yourself gambling isn’t illegal, so neither should “loot boxes” be.
---
Norn Rangers always will have synergy, but the way they hold staves as druids really sells it for me. Norn just have such powerful stances.
---
Looking at buying a permanet tool from the store.  I noticed everyone says to get the [Unbound Magic Mining Tool](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unbound_Magic_Logging_Pulse) because it specifically notes that it gathers 4 times per tick, while the wiki for certain others like the [Volatile Magic Mining Tool](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Volatile_Magic_Mining_Tool) explicitly states that it mines 3 times per animation.  Meanwhile, other items like the [Molten Alliance Mining Pick](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Molten_Alliance_Mining_Pick) don't list this warning but don't specify mining 4 per animation as an exclusive benefit.
---
Would I be good to go with the Molten/Fused set then?
---
Well, it's definitely going to depend on your PC specs as well, which I haven't seen you post yet. 
---
My personal experience is from playing on the following:
---
Intel 9700k CPU
---
RTX 2080ti GPU
---
32 GB RAM
---
Logging in is fine, but for the last month they've been making the LS4 episodes available again after the initial window for people.  They were doing this by making them 0 gem purchases in the gem store for one week each.  That's what you're seeing there.
---
Lol.
---
that would be great, but I'd be fine with just it being turned into a novelty
---
They would just pick the trait which gives 5s bonus Berserk time and be done with it.
---
Between 3 skills (7 8 9 keys) which can fit in the middle slots, with exception of Outrage which is valued for a low cooldown stunbreak, rest are situational increases at best.
---
Sundering Leap vs Peak performance Bull's Rush? I'll stick with Bull's Rush tbh, if only because the cooldown is better meaning more CC and chances to proc Peak Performance.
---
Wild blow is a 3 second increase vs again, 3 charges of Kick with Peak performance.
---
I would still use Shattering Blow but gotta pick between it and Outrage which is a 10s Stunbreak which gives 5 seconds of Berserk on breaking a stun.
---
I honestly rather upkeep Peak Performance than upkeep Bloody Roar Berserk mode which will end any way regardless if I blow 2 extra 20 - 30~ cooldown skills with low utility.
---
Rip my sweet GoE. I knew thee well
---
When im buying something, id like to know what. is that strange? idk maybe just me
---
Anyone have idea if PoF will be soon on sale?
---
I'm unfamiliar with the law though.  From what I've read I'm sure other games have just fully blocked that sort of content from Belgium, which if applied to GW2 would just completely remove the ability to open BL chests.  If Belgians can still get the level 10 key then it means Anet hasn't gone for the burnt bridges approach.
---
Yeet
---
waitaminute did somebody give me gold??? omg thank you what do i do with gold
---
You can't play berserker and be BS at the same time, it would be ridiculously bad. Much better off with core warrior for that. Berserker is meant to be a personal damage option but it's very lacking in damage as of current.
---
No its only needed to play the content.
---
Well said post...!  I do sort of disagree with this tho:
---
&gt; I still want more active involvement and seeking player feedback from devs...
---
I think this is never going to happen (and probably shouldn’t)...  The VAST majority of the player base instantly goes defensive and hates/complains about any changes to their class—even good ones.  Anet taking the instant-doom-and-gloom cries of the general population to heart would lead to nothing good.  Especially because a lot of players don’t even understand their class/the game.   
---
I could list many examples, but a quick one that comes to mind is how just, so, so, so many Revenant players hate offhand sword and want its changes reverted.  They legitimately want to give up a huge source of burst and arguably one of the top three mobility skills in the game to get back a 2 second block, despite the fact that oh sword is probably the biggest thing keeping the class competitive in PvP atm.  
---
While sometimes it may seem that the anet devs don’t understand their game (especially with glyph of stars, which I agree is straight up baffling), letting all the players have a voice before they’ve even actually seen the skills is just as bad, if not worse.   
---
Maybe they could have select players test things on an ongoing beta server, that could be interesting/highly productive I think.
---
Look in your hero panel under Story Journal and then click through all LS4 episodes. You don’t have those with the 200Gem tag but those without are available to play(when you have PoF).
---
*You didn’t have to massacre my children*
---
Friend tested it and claimed that Bloody Roar is bugged and only gives 10% damage increase as of current, but I haven't tested that myself to confirm it to be true. I guess it might explain a lot since people are saying the damage of berserker is still really bad.
---
Yeah, if I could get ahold of the Unbound (or volatile) sets I'd certainly pick them up, but unfortunately they're not available with no clear indication of when they will be again.
---
