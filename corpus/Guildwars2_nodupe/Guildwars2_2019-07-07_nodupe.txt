My boyfriend got me into GW2 and we only have heart of thorns. The fashion is what hooked me to the game! Hahaha getting Path of Fire means more fashion. :D
---
---
---
That would have been much more appealing. Just the barrel of a cannon and nothing else.
---
The community the shits on each other in map chat, spams stale memes and throws random Mesmer Portals and Blacklion Merchants in Loo Chests. F R I E N D L Y  C O M M U N I T Y :)
---
Hey.. First of, thank you so much for doing this.
---
- I got into Gw2 after i watched a video on youtube by Lazypeon.. He reviews games "if its worth playing". From the video, i like the questing/leveling system, the style of combat and beautiful places in the game.. so i decided to make a free account and give it a try. From that day on.. i've been playing on this free to play account till now(2years). 
---
- what really got me into the game is the world bosses.. achievements.. the festivals.. jumping puzzles and right now im mostly playing wvw. Playing wvw is fun.. seeing your server mates everyday feels like your part of a family but it kinda hard for me in wvw sometimes because i dont have access to mounts so its hard to follow when trying to capture big objectives.
---

---
- hello thank you for your time reading this again, have a nice day. (:
---
Met my SO while chatting away in guild chat about WoW lore, and this one nickname get really into telling the story of Arthas, makes the whole game so much more real to me as a casual gamer that just liked the cartoonish color scheme. Offered to pull me trhough some of the story in Caverns of Time. Get to chatting a lot, hitting it off. I think this person is definitely a woman. 
---
End up deciding to do more instances like that to go through more of the lore. Gets decided that I'm going to get some Appletizer sent to me, as the equivalent where I live isn't for sale anymore. Missing it bigtime. 
---
Have to exchange adresses on FB, see that this person is in fact a guy, not a woman. And they live on the other side of an ocaean. But hey, still nice, and we end up chatting more about non-game stuff. I want to do a favor back, get his adress, send some candy he can't get where he lives. Make sure to draw the adress and name really fancy, and the mail man even commented on it when he picked up the parcel later on apparently :)
---
Talk on discord on the night of the blood moon. Stay up together all through the night, watching the blood moon and just talking. Talk more and more every day. Eventually take up video chatting. Like each other even more. 
---
He tips me about Guild Wars 2. I say that is a game i've never even considered. Isn't that like a text adventure slash card game? He proceeds to show me I'm very wrong. I still want to stay loyal to WoW and my lovely guild and all.
---
I go to see him for a week and a half. The chemistry is very much there. it's official, we're now a couple. He tempts me... Try GW2 on my computer then.... I do... I love it....
---
We met on WoW because of a passion for WoW lore, but now play explusively GW2 together, and it's been half a year. We're about to spend our 4th actual IRL time together, he says I ought to just pay for the game now, since I like it so much. He's kind of right. But I'd rather spend that money on our time together IRL. I would really like to have a paid version of GW2 though. More bag slots, more content, more fun with my tiny TINY little character :D And maybe one day, I'll have a jumping rabbit that gets me everywhere too, like he does... That would be awesome.
---
At first i tought those people were tiny and i realized other 2 are huge
---
When playing this game it's important to have long term, aswell as short term goals. this is not a short term goal. while you always do your dailys, also look for something to do in the meantime thats a little closer to you.
---
Your greatest enemy will be heat. Laptops are tight places usually only with adequate airflow. Be sure you are also dusting the inside at least once a month.
---
That's far from casual. You play everything the game has to offer.
---
My source is that I plaed all of those games as well, for several years.
---
I played on release and took a multi year break until recently. Got into GW2 cause I played GW1 as my primary game from 06 till GW2 release. I've actually bought both expansions since my return last month. I'm really getting back into the game because my wife said she was interested and would play it with me due to the free core game and she has been loving it. 
---
She doesn't feel we should be spending money on the expansions for her since she is still progressing through the levels on her first character (Elementalist - She loves lighting shit on fire lol). She is just shy of lvl 50 now, so making solid progress for casually grinding through the core game. Obtaining a free code would be amazing and let us both play through that content together as a first experience for both of us. I'm still catching up on the living stories and HoT expansion when not helping her on core, so PoF content is still brand new to me as well. 
---
We are on NA though, and I know you said you prefer to gift to EU. Wish I knew about this promotion whenever it was active. Thanks for the consideration!
---
No, I play WvW casually. I don't roam,  generally. I don't play in a guild or an organized group. I follow a commander around and take points. 
---
I don't PvP seriously and any good player is going to beat me. I found one profession I can sort of play on and I play on that.
---
I don't run T4 fractals hardly ever, but i do run T1 fractals on occassion. I occassionally do dungeon runs.
---
90% of my time in game is spent in the open world or story instances.
---
My wife and I both grew up playing the first GW and we started playing GW2 right when it was first released shortly after we first met in college. We ended up taking a break from GW2 as college life ended up getting in the way. Now I am currently in my last year of medical school, which has far fewer exams than the first 3 years, so subsequently I have a lot more time to spend with her before I start my post-grad training in 2020. We've recently started getting back into GW2 together, but unfortunately, we are living on student loans and having a hard time scraping up the cash to buy the expansion for both of our accounts. It would be amazing if I was able to cut that total cost in half and enjoy everything the game has to offer with my beautiful wife. We love exploring the world and questing together, even reminescing about the great times we had together back when we first met.
---
I'm against classic servers. I believe MMOs should keep evolving. So I'm not going to play classic.
---
I crafted the Predator a few months before PoF for the Deadeye spec but the lack of footfalls was a bit disappointing. I also became annoyed at the sound effects after awhile. The HMS is definitely a niche legendary and I also love the projectile and sound effects.
---
Older games tended to give priority to Intel CPU and GW2 is notorious for being one of those type of games. An AMD rep even said that modern games should bench better because devs code games with AMD in mind now as well since modern consoles use AMD architecture
---
I will always have you, Tom...
---
When on vacation I play on an Acer notebook that is 5 or years old and which has an i5-4200U, which is a 1.6 GHz chip that turbo boosts to 2.6GHz. What is the model of the i7 you have?
---
My notebook has Intel integrated graphics. Now you say that your notebook has AMD integrated graphics, but an Intel CPU? That seems unusual. Are you sure that it isn't a standalone AMD graphics chip?
---
In any case, with my notebook, which I suspect is less powerful than yours, I can get 20-30FPS with most of the settings turned down.
---
What is the model of your notebook? If we knew that, we could give a more definitive answer.
---
This has nothing to do with any of that. This is just an idiot being an idiot.
---
The vast majority of times someone is lambasted by the public for any of the things you mention, it is accurate.
---
Qadim is shaped like a friend
---
Medium armor Blossoming Mist Shard really is one of the best armor pieces in the game, in my opinion. Especially the chest piece. I use it on my [Daredevil](https://i.imgur.com/pZn8Pq6.jpg).
---
I love the colour scheme, the teal looks fantastic with the gold, and Grave apparently makes for a nice leathery colour too. The whole look is fantastic.
---
I've been trying to fashion war some of my other characters and I can never settle on anything that looks quite as nice as Medium Blossoming Mist Shard. The artists at Anet outdid themselves on that one.
---
Awesome!
---
you havent been keeping up with the news my friend, they wont.
---
Make a Lightfury Asura and obviously had to do this 😂
---
I've always wanted to play MMOs, so in 2012, when Guild wars 2 came out it caught my eyes and I started playing it on my laptop. I haven't gotten Path of Fire, and would like to play it again.
---
I7 if you're not just going to be only playing GW2, as more modern games are utilizing more cores and threads.
---
I5 if you're just making a Gw2 Machine and for nothing else.   
---
Ryzen Platform  5-7 (2000 and 3000 series) - Is also another really good alternative as you'll have a upgrade path with the platform. People will argue that it's intel or bust for gw2, but with the released DX12 mod, i don't see much point to the argument anymore. So i'd say just go with whatever looks to be the better value for you.
---
Well right now is to get lvl80 and then to learn what armor levels exist to get them one by one until I get legendary
---
Do it today. Soul Beast is not much different that ranger in how they play but it hits a lot harder.   : )
---
Worth unlocking.
---
Well Level 80 exotics (2nd highest tear with orange/golden names) are pretty easy to get, especially berzerker stats (around 8g on the TP for a full armor set, at least that's what I heard)
---
Above that we got Ascended (pink names) and legendary (purple names) which have the same amount of stats. The legendarys only come with unique skins and the ability to swap stats /upgrades while you are out of fight.
---
I love the sylvari too, though generally I love fae based stories and creatures  so this might explain it.   
---
In my opinion GW2 integrated them pretty nicely into the lore. They fit perfectly in my eyes and I love the aesthetics and culture they came up with.   
---
Closely following as a second is the Charr for me. I think they have an interesting ideology and cultural and social structure. Not something I saw often in mmos for a playable race.
---
&gt; that is subjective, you can think it's "amazingly good" but other people can think it's terrible. the numbers speak for themselves, if it was as good as you seem to think it is then they would have way more viewers. sooner or later objectively good content will get noticed.
---
I'm not saying amazingly good to ME, I'm saying in-general as an example. 300 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. To watch every video on Youtube would take more time than a human being that lived to be 100 would be alive for (and that's assuming they stayed posted to a screen 24/7, never slept, never got up to use the bathroom, and never gone senile). But were're talking about a platform like Twitch, one where videos are deleted after so much time. It's even more likely that good creators could slip through the cracks there. It's just a fact of life. Good content/work is overlooked sometimes.
---
&gt; where is your source for this?
---
Every single game that has benefited from people playing their games and streaming it. Surgeon Simulator, Five Nights at Freddy's, Skate Series, **MINECRAFT**, etc. It is earned media. Bringing more viewship of GW2 means it's more potential for people to find something that interests them with the game or makes them curious enough to play it.
---
&gt; witch can be a good marketing tool if used correctly but giving lootboxes to players just incentivises them to leave the stream open while they are afk or doing something else, people will take the path of least resistance and that is it, if they don't really care about the stream itself then they are not going to watch it.
---
Except some WILL. It's casting a wide net and doing one of the most important thing to get people hooked; to give your content a chance. 
---
&gt;  good to the community and all that crap but twitch viewership for mmos is generally less than a quarter of even subreddits
---
And yet it's still a significant number on a platform that is steadily rising on popularity. "*100 million unique monthly users*". Beyond that it offers potentially a different demographics who might not want to get on Reddit or who don't look at GW2 stuff normally just happen across a GW2 stream because they saw it trending higher than usual.
---
&gt; literally everything you mention as a positive for twitch is done far better on youtube
---
And they could so stuff on Youtube too. It's not exclusive to just Twitch, it's just that Twitch is easier to manage that kind of promotional stuff with Twitch given the way that platform has been designed.
---
&gt; and online written guides
---
Not everyone uses guides. Plus having someone you can watch and interact with is just massivley better. You can actually ask questions that they or the chat can potentially answer. Or other people can ask questions/input that you didn't even think to ask about.
---
&gt; and just asking for help in game
---
Not everyone is comfortable asking in game. Some people are more comfortable watching a video or asking on a stream. Plus a stream allows you to watch what's going on and they can kinda mouse to things or show you the stuff more clearly than talking to people in chat.
---
&gt; you even get the lootboxes from the daily rewards occasionally.
---
So? More rewards isn't exactly a bad thing.
---
haha :D this gives me nice nostalgia. My first GW1 game was Factions &lt;3
---
This would not be for me but my sister. She started playing in 2012 and played mostly with her guild of people from guild wars 1. She really liked playing jumping puzzle and open world content (she is Mesmer) and played until the karka content and a bit of fractals. She then stopped playing a bit before the expansions came.  I wanted to play with her again and show her the new story of pof which is really great (she stopped during living story 1)

MMORPGs and Guild Wars 2 was a game that a few friends of mine wanted to try out. What can I say, I was hooked on the fluidity of the combat and the stunning atmosphere. But what caused me to fall in love with the game the most is probably the fact that I can enjoy Guild Wars outside of the game. Meaning my friends all enjoy it.  Even new people I meet like the game. I have met my girlfriend within Guild Wars and we coincidentally happend to live in the same small town. Rather lucky I must admit. I would love to win the Key just for the sake of giving it to a friend of mine that has recently started playing. She loves the game already and I want to give her an opportunity to optain at least a few mounts as she really envies mine. I think that it is time that I give that awesome experience I had with Guild War 2 away to my friend. That is the only reason why I participate. 
---
Best of luck to all the others!
---
Judging by Ronald McDonald next to Vivi my guess is VRChat
---
Depends on the game mode. Also for PvP it depends on the matchup
---
We're just doing the duel things in PvP. 1v1.

I've completed Newborn Skyscales. How can I continue Saving Skyscales? It's locked..

new player here! love the game! hope i win!

I see the problem.

It's because you're drunk or not drunk enough.

Yeah, I'm always drunk.

[Cloaking Trap Ranger](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vNAQNAoYVjMqQ5K2tCurAVLWcEsmGQsqoxEAmcVu8hbzd6Wy56C-jhSAABA8AAQS9HKM/ZwJAY99Hi+QAohSQpPCAXp8LH9BAA-e) Dual Dagger/Short bow or Dagger+Torch/ Shortbow. 
---
I've been using this build. It offers a lot of security. The build is straightforward. Just lay down the traps and time your cloaking to stay out of sight from mobs. So you have 4 hiding counts in all for all 4 trap skills. With the addition of using leap with smokescales smokescreen you'll get 5. So you'll just rush through the mobs and lay the traps and watch the mobs die while you do the riverdance or something..disappear and reappear or keeping placing traps that COULD potentially last for 12 seconds. Or if you want to just focus trap just drop them all in one go. You'll also live a lot longer when you're on the world map and become a pillar within a bunch of misfits doing map events. Try it out.
---
Listen here, I've had like twelve shots of whiskey and I'm a lightweight. Help me beat them.
---
I never said anything about enjoyment. Your reply makes no sense in context of my post.
---
What news? That Intel is scared of AMD gaining on them or that AMDs next  mainstream CPU  is nipping at the heels of intels 9900k? Yes I read those reports. All I’m saying is that Intel always manages to inch over AMD just a few months later
---
Play a game you're better at than them.

Get good noob

You’re level 7, focus on getting to 80 before you start flipping out about fashion. Some of those pieces are loooong term goals if you’re only just starting.
---
I challenged them to Overwatch but they don't want me duel me because they know they'll lose. I'm the only courageous one who will fight people when I'm inexperienced.
---
Shutting down pvp and saying nothing changes is a pretty big implication. 
---
What if you played only pvp and they shut it down? Nothing changes?
---
Thats all fren
---
Stupid doesnt make you courageous lol
---
I think you're a wuss for not fighting them in my honor.
---
Thanks! I looked it up on the wiki and tried it. It's a lot better than doing Dragon Arena. 6 Coffers from finishing the event plus a few from drops.
---
I'd guess that OP runs with organized groups that don't mind. We always assume everyone in Raids must do everything by the book, but  (just on reddit) we've seen that people get away with some pretty non-standard things.
---
Well rotations can certainly seem harder later if you play a handicap build like ranger longbow as you’re learning the game. Rotations only matter for raids/fractals in pve, but longbow ranger just isn’t good in those modes, so the rotation argument is kinda null for now. I would reserve judgement for how difficult it is to do your rotation well until you actually go do it on the golem though
---

---
Really wish LS3 took the Sylvari ideas that got dropped from HoT and expanded on them. Could've had a nightmare court themed map, or at least a section of one, or Malyck's tree. Maybe clearing out some residual mordrem or some corruption to help the court/other tree.
---
Instead we got human politics along with a splash of aurene and jormag/primordus.
---
For pvp actually berserker is kinda bad and core warrior and spellbreaker are both good
---
A: It's very possible and checks out. In the end, it's one question they are trying to ask:

&gt;**Can I purposely choose to not stat my armor at anytime?** ***Is there a 'None' option?***

...which no one has answered.

---
Without food or buffs, the highest damage skills in the rotation, it is about 4-5k loss. And OP didn't say no one had noticed...people just didn't complain. Which is believable because not everyone plays by the book and it could be with organized groups.
---
Plus, Fractals aren't *that* demanding. If you know the debuffs and have the resistance for it, you can easily do them--as you get higher, it just gets more challenging.
---
&gt; Banner. Place a battle standard that revives fallen allies and finishes downed foes. Once placed, the banner periodically grants boons to allies. Picking up the banner reduces the recharge of this skill.
---
maybe that's why but I could've sworn I was dropping it in perfect range.
---
Yeah, limit is 10.

As soon as they bring the pirate hate back to the gem store i'll be throwing that one together.

&gt; Lazy Peon has had to delete his Final Fantasy levelling criticism video because of getting death threats from that community.
---
Unlikely.
---
Probably took it down because mass downvotes and tons of misinformation - As usual.
---
Remember when he was consistantly saying how the game was dead and there was nobody playing PvP, This was about 2 years ago when he was joining empty hotjoin lobbys btw.
---
Should be a buff on the character you're doing it on indicating how much time you have to wait. There's 2 hour time gate after each main step in the collection before you can start the next, alternatively the daily reset let's you start it too.
---
I use a spellbreaker build, yeah. I'm still new to PvP so when it comes to Mesmers, like my friend with at least a few thousand hours worth of PvP has, I have no idea how to combat her. I kind of just want to see a warrior class beat her in a duel. She says warriors are overpowered, but I don't feel it.
---
Okay look, you can call me whatever it is you think I am. That's okay But people self define as well. I define myself as a casual. My approach to the game is casual. Sure I'm on a spectrum, but I'd die a slow death in hard core guild and I thrive in casual guilds. Whatever you want to call me is fine by me, because none of this invalidates my point.
---
Casuals in this game have tons of stuff to do and they're generally less likely to complain about a lack of stuff to do, because it takes them longer to do everything. 
---
Hard core players are the ones who are complaining about not having hard core stuff to do.
---
The number of complaints by casuals about stuff to do is noticably less.
---
The thing is, there are many dedicated casual players just like me. That's why my tag is hardcore casual.
---
What are you trying to say? Do you want them to bring paying for power in? (Aka p2w) Do you want the raids to be more challenging? Do you want the achievements to be more challenging? Time consuming?
---
What would you find enticing as a reward? What should be done to solve your problems?
---
He was complaining about the levelling which as I understand it  Final Fantasy players hate it too. So why downvote a video talking about an aspect of a game you hate as well. .
---
For me, gw2 is more of a casual game and its not something  i  would go to for challenging content. There are other  games out there that caters to that better.
---
I would imagine the majority of the playerbase doesn’t really engage much of the challenging content that gw2 currently offers judging by statistics on gw2efficiency.
---
I'm only crafting my second legendary so far and it was honestly very close between exordium and hms divinity. I only ended up going for exordium for the convenience factor of so many classes using greatswords even if I think the weapon itself looks like hot garbage. Thankfully the precursor for exordium looks nice.
---
After that I'm absolutely going for the big ship though.
---
Eh, I played FFXIV for about 3 months.
---
Everyone was nice, lots of them were weird but I didn't encounter any toxicity.
---
The dude suggesting WoW is funny though - WoW is about as toxic as it can get in regards to elitism and general toxicity. 
---
Go ranked BG, Arenas or any Raid and you're almost guaranteed to be flamed and kicked multiple times within your first month of playing endgame.
---
I normally play shooters, but I wanted to try something else. Since my boyfriend and other friends of mine are playing Guild Wars, I started Guild Wars. I love the many possibilities in creating a character and the world is so beautifully build you always find something new. I am from Germany btw.
---
OP posted about how they are challenging themselves in GW2 and is asking how to cater to elitists that may not be so willing to accept them.
---
If they stated the question alone, it would have been questioned the same way: "But why?". 
---
This reddit alone already has plenty of "moronic" builds that are genuinely okay ways to play. Not everyone is elitist, some play the game and play the hand they are dealt...we are the ones who shame those who don't want to conform to playing a "right" way.
---
&gt; Im pretty sure Lazy Peon just deleted the video because of the way more dislikes than likes he got. He might have understood that his video was rushed and very opinionated on a subject he didnt understand or even put an effort to it.
---
Pretty sure he also did this with GW2 before he got into it.
---
Why does the game client allow the option to save password but never saves the password?
---
Yep. I watched him stream GW2 once and he got lost trying to join PvP and ended up in an empty hotjoin lobby.
---
Waited about 10 seconds and said "Well this games PvP is dead" closed the game and went on a huge rant about it.
---
This was pre-hot too.
---
Magic Heroes Banner? I placed a Guild Heroes Banner over 24 hours ago. I've logged out, swapped characters, everything, since placing it. It's still there and people are still using it! Is this normal? Or cue the "If your banner lasts longer than 24 hours, call a mender..."
---
I actually agree to this. You have so many options to go to in Guardian. The only character in my slot that has 3 different gears on my inventory to switch onto, don't have ascended gears yet.
---
I used to play on a pos laptop and the game ran fine on low settings, although my attempts at raiding were hindered by heat issues. (It would overheat and turn itself off.) This probably contributed to it crapping out entirely and I had to buy a better computer because it wouldn't turn on any more. That was in 2015. Now I play on a four year old laptop i7 2.6 with 8 gb ram on medium with no problems. I could probably go for the high settings but uh... I don't care. I didn't even know what settings I had until I checked just now.
---
Awesome guide!  I would have given up on the gold medal without it.  Finally got my wings thanks to you!
---
In the midtime I'll be using different things I get, but this will be my long term goal, I think will keep me interested on the game, and proud to post the real outfit on this reddit once I get it in some years
---
I got into GW2 back at release, I was hooking by GW1, played for about a year, maybe 2, then life got in the way, I am currently trying to get back in, have been pretty solid for about 2 weeks. I keep looking to get the expansion, but its a little out of reach right now. You are awesome for the give away.
---
&gt;It says relaxed and unconcerned
---
are you unconcerned about the game?, playing for that many years and investing so much and you have no concerns whatsoever about it?
---
I don't know man.
---
Yep, I'm unconcerned about the game. Games die all the time. No way can I afford to attach myself to a game. I have a real life. I have real life issues. The game is fun. The game I played before this...was fun. The game I'll play after this, that'll be fun.  I'm attached to my guild and the people in it. I take those personal relationships more seriously than the game (sometimes to my detriment). But the game itself, I don't see it as an investment. I see it as entertainment.
---
I spend a ton of time watching Netflix, but I'm not a hard core Netflix watcher. I watch something else if I didn't have Netflix.

First of no theres no option for it
---
Second. I can see u challanging urself. And im fine whit it if u wanna do it in fractals n raids as well as wvw (meaning whit ur squad)...but i strongly think u should only do it in group content whit the consent of ur group. Hell if ur group is willing u might as well do naked raids. I used to do those in wvw whit our group. The fact is tho that everyone knew we where doing it. 
---
Basicly its fine if ur raid group or wvw group knows it. But just doing it whitout they knowledge thinking its fine until they complain of damage i think is plain wrong and is called "getting carried" 
---
Do it if they ok whit it but pls dont do it like "its fine if they dont notice"
---
mine saves my password, but it doesn't look like there's anything typed in the password bar for some reason. it works when i try to log in though. not sure what the deal with it is.

I am so gladly surprised by this info, being Norns my favorite race and Ayla Zelandonii my most beloved book character. Of course I have named my toons after her ever since I started playing video games. Knowing this gives a new sense to being Norn and makes me feel even more attached to it than I did before. Thank you so much for sharing this ♥

From my understanding and experience the duration of Guild Banners is extremely inconsistent and you have them for either the few hours they are supposed to last or for several days and I have not really been able to figure out why some banner bug out and stay for a long time why others don't.
---
So it's not unusual for a banner to stay for days even if it's probably not intended :p
---
Maybe this has already been asked, but I can't seem to find the dragon bash stampede events. Am I looking in the wrong places? I've been scouting the maps mentioned on wiki but they haven't shown up
---
While the game has failed to deliver on a number of claims ... this isn't one of them as far as I know. I don't remember ever seeing anything from ANet claiming to offer a lot customization. 
---
Complaints about lacking of variety isn't anything new either.
---
Many of the NPC stuff seems to be more like outfits ... no thanks.
---
Does anyone know any contact info for these?
---
&gt;have more skins to choose from that aren't exclusively in the gem store
---
So, this is a masked "mimimi all good skins are gemstore" thread?
---
&gt; i7 1.6 GHz with AMD integrated graphics
---
That's impossible.
---
You can't have an intel cpu with amd integrated graphics
---
Anyways, from my past experience with playing on a laptop (good ol' core 2 duo w/ "midrange" discrete graphics), GW2 runs better than Tera.  That old piece of junk had an issue with microstutters in Tera, but it got solid framerates in GW2, outside of LA.  It however still performed well enough that I could husk block at TT, something that requires you to precisely time your skills for a period of 10 or so minutes on average.
---
Your biggest issues are going to be your CPU and RAM.  Though your ipc is probably better than my dinosaur core 2 duo, it's still a potential bottleneck, and that old laptop still bottlenecked on RAM despite me upgrading to 8GB - I had to kill my browser to open up GW2.
---
Probably the most impactful setting for you is going to be your character model limit - crank that down as low as it goes.
---
Either you're being ignorant on purpose, or you're being snarky about not knowing who he is. Both of which feeds into Jawgeous's arguments and just proving that he's absolutely correct in his criticism of this community.
---
All you need to do is go to LA and see how many people use gemstore skins over ingame earnable skins. Sure it is a matter of personal preference, just like skill in most cases in most games outweights brute stats.
---
I'm looking forward for them to introduce new weapon to each classes. Warrior with spear? Or dual Greatsword? Guardian main-hand shield? Etc etc.
---
i always thought playing barbie was a big selling point of gw2. i must've been mistaken then. at the very least, the game has pretty good customization when compared to some others in the genre. i just wish we had more contact with them. I don't particularly like outfits myself, but i think if there were more of them in game, or just basic pieces, i can't see many people complaining. i feel like it would also boost diversity in customization regardless.
---
Is this all that surprising? I recall this streamer making a "why should you play Guild Wars 2 video", posting it on reddit and then having a massive huff on both reddit and Twitter when it wasn't highly upvoted.
---
I've followed Jawgeous for a while and it seems that he's always wanted a particular thing from the community which is recognizing his importance. He isn't getting that here since the community, in general, is less interested in steamers and so he's moving on.
---
In order to get jackal you need a certain mastery level in either the skimmer or Springer mastery tracks btw
---
Thanks for having a giveaway!
---
NA player; I played GW1 back when I was young, and got GW2 in mid 2014. What got me truly obsessed was WvW, and finding a great guild to play with. Made some really good friends and will always appreciate my time in Tyria.
---
as far as I understood he paid for the skip because he couldnt stand how boring the leveling and the story is, and Im not surprised - early story and leveling is terrible in ff14, its like semi-interactive slide show
---
Youtube Warrior videos. 
---
There are plenty of montages and guides by pros on youtube, I suggest watching a variety of them, take note what they do which is similar, and learn from them.
---
Me me!
---
Praise Joko
---
Well I don't get it 😂 
---
*Where's joko*
---
Wow I am IN.
---
Freedom.
---
#TL:DR : OP wants all the NPC Outfits/ Plain clothes
---
Look, I'm sure there are many other players who want these as well, but I assure yu, there are many other things which probably could use customization options.
---
Just to name one : Dying weapons.
---
Your activity here and on forums proves you are very concerned. It doesnt matter how you define yourself. I can define myself as millionaire, it doesnt make me one.
---
I just need someone to recreate the Fast-food Battle Cosplay scene.

good luck on your goal!! Welcome to the game :)
---
I want to make biggest possible asura 🤣
---
Thnx!
---
EU casual player here :)
---
I know that for me a part of the issue is that what looks good is a personal thing. For many of my characters I find myself looking through all the available armor sets and only find 3 or 4 items that actually look good to me (Playing a Charr doesn't help with finding good looking clothing choices, stupid tail clipping issues:P ). I purchased those items that I liked, and now I don't have a desire to look for new items as I'm happy with my look and the new stuff all looks worse to me. I'm not a fan of fancy floating glowy doodads or giant oversized armor pieces. I enjoy more realistic looking armor and would love to see some more options that actually look like something I would wear to protect myself from flying swords and magical bolts.
---
Nothing against people that like those things, just not what interests me:)
---
Nothing in the game is advertised heavily, that's part of the problem tbh.
---
thats not the topic here
---
I mean yeah, sure. Then consider how many people play GW2 at high settings knowing how shit the engine is.
---
You’re not even close to the record.
---
this is more of the point i was getting at. i'm thankful for the articulation. I don't have anything against gemstore pieces or anything like that. I just wish that there was more pieces in general because that would open the door to many more looks. all we need is a heavy *looking* [set](https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2016/05/25/got-silly-armour/25-got-armour-stark.w710.h473.2x.jpg) for light armor (spellblade aesthetic?), or a medium *looking* [set](https://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/703-Casterly-Rock-Grey-Worm-3.jpg) for heavies. 
---
i also love the more subtle armour choices we have, i just don't believe that it should be limited to core game. imagine some cultural armour/ outfit (if it HAS to be) like [this](https://huntersinsight.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/culturepalettecharrnpcs.jpg) for charr or a steel prosthetic [leg/boot](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/yONmx) skin.
---
Awesome screenshot!
---
Can you, please, share what GW2Hook preset that is? :)
---
1g for each daily chest,  is a bit much.  take bloodstone fen,  takes 2 minutes to farther 10 unbound magic anf do 10 gliding skills 
---
Now 1g, for completing all 4 dailies in a map...maybe.  But tbh, if you're smart you'll earn a good bit just by playing.  you don't have to farm. 
---
I don't really think this game needs easier ways to gather gold.
---
Easy as moot loot. Do one hour overtime in real life, buy 1000g ingame
---
in 3 years, game will be 10/10 then.
---
gw2's gear customization is second to none in terms of pure amount of it available even outside the gemstore. only one coming close would prolly be wow, but even they lack dyeing.
---
in terms of model customization, they are somewhere in the middle ground with some of the new releases blowing them out of the water.
---
Could we use more? Yes, but by no means is the game lacking
---
Hey whatsup dude. My little brother and I live in europe. He is 13 is playing this game. Im trying to save up some money to buy the expansion but its so expensive. He really wants to try out elite specs and thats why he cannot fully invest into the game like he wants. He is stuck with core builds. He really wants to try those new cool specializations where you unlock new weapons. But because he knows he will never get the new spec he becomes very sad and doesn't want to play anymore while he loves it. I am trying to save for the expansion but im in college working for my degree and man, that takes soo much money.  Everything I earn with money 99% goes to my college and 1% stays for me to buy or save. Now i have like 10 bucks but thats not enough for both expansions. If  i win 1 key for pof so my little bro can play this game which he loves since guild wars 1 he would go nuts! Again thanks for giving away keys. Not alot of people do this. This is very kind of you! Good luck for the winners!
---
But Qadim is right though
---
I'll take a stab for a friend of mine.
---
How I got into the game was quite simple. I had played the original guild wars after having a falling out with WoW after the release of the Cataclysm expansion(All guilds I knew basically died, all gear I owned was now worthless, Everybody in general decided to bring out their inner prick, etc etc you get the point) and very quickly fell in love.
---
The story was great, I loved the solo gameplay with AI soldiers, and ultimately I was hooked until circumstances caused me to lose access to my account for several years.
---
Enter GW2.
---
I had already seen the various videos Totalbiscuit had made on the game, and the idea that we could play as other races was pretty great at the time. Being able to beat the tar out of old adlebern was also a plus at the time.
---
So, after scrounging up some money, I finally set off on my little journey through the game, and had a blast. The lack of timers on the world dragons meant I could actually kill a dragon with enough time and patience, and the dye system was, pardon the vocal pun, to die for.
---
I later would gain access to the older account again after discovering my old CD keys, and that's when I got access to the fiery dragon sword. Was the best part of discovering it.
---
Now, given my qualification at the start of the thread, one might wonder why.
---
Once upon a time, I made(and still own) a guild. Said guild started off as essentially random family members, the occasional random person who joined up for a week and left without so much as a neutral wave goodbye, and even dabbled with other guilds before they imploded and I was left alone again. So a few friends of mine, curious about an MMO with no monthly fees, decided to try out the game.
---
Times were great. Having a full five man party for events and dungeons was amazing, and it being prior to HoT that was pretty much it. However...
---
Notice how I keep mentioning guild implosions? Yeah, I have bad luck with those. All of my friends, in tandem, decided to get bored at the same time with the game(And before people theorize that I had something to do with it, no, we are still good friends post GW2, they just got bored for reasons beyond me.) At least one of the reasons was the death of an engineer bomb build thanks to traits being massively changed in prep for Heart of Thorns.
---
While I'm not expecting any miracles, one of said friends is what I would call a hopeful in terms of potentially coming back. My hope is that not having to pay for the expansion might convince them to go all in, or at least see what PoF has to offer. I'll understand if this disqualifies me, but I figure I'd try for their sake.
---
Do note that we are all EU players.
---
Best of luck to all other entrants.
---
Eu player here - I started playing in closed beta, I so excited from all the pre release hype that I preordered. Been playing on-off since then but recently fell in love again because the gameplay and world is just so much fun.
---
And we'd only see two new raids and fractals, and one more wvw update by then.
---
Well yes, need to fill up the emptiness between "content" releases.
---
The value of the skins my warrior uses is less than 5g and to me it looks the best. Did I fail the endgame?
---
I got one key (using a VPN) and gave it to someone else, he's EU as well and it worked without issues. Not sure if he used a VPN to enter it on the website or not though.
---
well it has to render things "under" the game which takes performance
---
It’s impressive but not “hard core”.
---
Hard core would be “No sleep” rules.. 
---
Play a 24hr stream straight through with only bathroom and bio breaks.
---
Do that and I’ll finally call it a “hard core” challenge... So for now let’s downgrade to name to the “impressive” challenge
---
does this happen if you have just taco running with no modules displayed?
---
[Wing 6 is to the west of Lion's Arch, below the unused zone](https://imgur.com/a/2BBb6ft)
---
How to Train Your Dragon is perfect template for GW2 memes xD
---
Open world bosses were great, unfortunately they are a pain to organise (map queue system please?) And complete destroy most people's PCs.
---
As long as people fight additional difficulties, there is no hope for a proper long-term progression.
---
The mastery system was meant to offer that endgame progression feel without increasing levels/gear. Unfortunately, for me at least, they missed the mark and probably won't ever make changes to improve it.
---
PvP is good. But you can't tell so someone who say enjoys RPGs or Dark souls for example, and wants more content, to play a a PvP game instead...
---
People like different games/game modes for different reasons.
---
Raid rewards have got nothing to do with trying not to be p2w most big western mmos are not p2w but can be much more rewarding than GW2 in their raids.
---
I say bring it back as a guild Hall.  That way everyone can be happy.
---
checks out how exactly? cuz OP said so?
---
people did answer, there is no "none" option
---
you linking me 2 build editor pages then going "about 4-5k loss"..based on what exactly? what part of those 2 links prove or argue for the 4-5k loss?
---
are you OP on their main account or something?
---
VR chat.
---
You are going crazy. What is the next thing you're gonna tell us? That you see some Bloodstone crazed Beasts?
---
Hey, I've been playing GW since 2005 with my friends, and mostly their company got me hooked, especially in times when I had no friends outside of this game. If I'd be one of the lucky winners I'd give the key to one of them who has been on and off for a while and doesn't have PoF yet.
---
Thank you for the give away!
---
The fact you've seen more than 1 is the most amazing thing for be.
---
If you don't have enough infusions on you to look like you swallowed the sun then of course you have failed the endgame... We are not in 2012 anymore when down to earth skins were meta.
---
/s
---
Seriously though, I am interested in what skins you use. What race is your warrior? I have a hard time finding heavy armour that I like and doesn't cost a fortune
---
  
---
Hello! 
---
I smelt this post from afar. Just kidding, we are all here to get the keys. Well, my adventure with this game started pretty simple – 2 weeks ago, if my memory doesn’t  make a joke on me – i was searching for a good online game (and it wasn’t Just one week of my searches, i've had a chance to play lot of games so far \*cough\*), then one of my friends came to rescue and  recommended me this one. At the beginning i was really sceptical, because let’s say it honestly -  i was and i’m still a free to play gamer, thus in game exist lot of limits for me.  But everything is for people, i belive. You may ask what hooked me in this game ? First, vivid graphics and varied locations on that big map. I really love travelling around all those locations or  maps, call it whatever you want, and sight see. Second thing is, what suprised me most – super friendly society. I know, what i’m talking about, i can make comparision to other games. Players here are helpful, patient and most import benevolent! In my opinon it s very difficult to find people like that these days. The more i play the more New, interesting people i meet. Last but not least – the fasion Word. Literally All those costiumes are lovable. I wish i could obtain most of them haha \*cough\*. Unlike to wardrobe In my room, wardrobe In game is bigger and more sapcious. Every girl dreams about  wardrobe like that, Lol. Ok, i think that’s it, sorry to make this comment so long! Kind regards from EU Server!
---
Forcing a guild squad to enter e raid from the guild hall is overkill.  
---
Just make it mandatory to have unlocked guild hall raid portal and that the squad is full of guild members is enough.
---
So you mean do map completion like it was in the first days of Gw2? 
---
Yeah I remember that.
---
ITT : Genius players blaming kodash for bandwagoning at the first sight without realising kodash had been getting screwed by this for more than a year. They have been full and not linked for over a year and the last months their activity kept them hard stuck in T5. 
---
They can sit on kodash for another year not getting links until activity drops to dead completely; which is what happened for them before and for the guilds that came from RS. It's clear anet wasn't going to help them because they've done this consistently to german servers since links were established and slowly killed every german community. (Elona RS kodash all entirely dead R I P). If international links come and they still won't get a link over more active servers; it's no suprise these players realise there is no hope for their server and move on. 
---
Meanwhile piken has the same issue for 2 weeks and gild their own cry threads because they didn't get a link ONCE.
---
I hope people realize you can get banned yourself for abusing the report feature. 
---
lol
---
Bag slots for your main character?
---
I started playing on an old (10 year) ThinkPad with an i5, 8gb and integrated graphics. For most of the game it was fine, but it would get bad with a lot of other players or in 10+ mobs. Didn't really notice till I hit 80 and started doing more dailies and popular content.
---
As problems started I was shopping and picked up a ryzen 2600g+mobo, 16gb of ram, ssd and some misc parts from r/buildapcsales recycled a case, and psu, replaced bad fans. By budget shopping I've got less that 400 in it.
---
I dunno why this has slipped my mind, I’m gonna increase it by 2. Thanks stranger!
---
Piken didn't have a link and immediately had a cry thread, gilded and spammed it reeee'ing about how it's unfair. Meanwhile they'll flame people who leave after being in this situation for years with less people for being filthy bandwagoners. 
---
Can't tell if willfully ignorant or actually retarded.
---
I think your a month late
---
That fucking asura is gonna haunt me in my sleep😂😂
---
Im sure they said near HoT release which introduced guild halls that they dont want to make them too useful or hubs will get empty. (Think DR, LA, Rata sum, Aerodrome, mistlock)
---
There was a similar issue on GW1, too.   
---
They just haven't cracked the code on how to make them both legitimately functional,they've always come across as a goldsink type purchase
---
My problems with the guild hall are as follows (mostly from a WvW/PvP perspective):
---
* Arena too small
---
* No balance split in arena (still uses pve stats)
---
* Closing instance msg frequently
---
* Splitting squad across multiple instances
---
* Scribing siege blueprints process is disgustingly long as opposed to tactics which are instantly deposited
---
* Decoration within x space limited
---
idk there's probs more but those are the main offenders for me, especially when we first got guild hall and finding out you can only place like 10 pieces of furni in an area... yeah let me just place chairs + a dining table but can't place no damn candles or other furni gg rip.
---
In the UK we have two big events in July so we celebrate it through July too ^_^
---
Ty, but it wasn’t that bad. Just zooming out/in and aoe placement was a chore.
---
As many others have said, in order to get this look you'll need the expansions of the game (there are often sales, if you wait for one you can get them for around 20€) and you'll need to do raids.
---
Concerning raids, if you want an advice, I'd look for a raid build and start using it while leveling (or something as close as possible, at least - in the case of a few builds it's obviously impossible to use them while leveling, since they use elite specs that can only be used at lvl 80 and require an expansion). This way, when you're lvl 80 you'll know the rotation already, and in order to actually start raiding you'll only need exotic gear and learn a few boss mechanics (and the raid bosses of Gw2 aren't too complicated, mechanic-wise). Personally I don't think raids are too difficult or time-consuming, although I admit I could be called a "veteran" of this game. Anyway, I always do pug raids (meaning teams composed of random people), so if you manage to find a guild that makes raid you might have an even easier raid experience than me. After all, aside from Dhuum, you only need to kill a few bosses for a total of 25 times, ad a couple of bosses are really incredibly easy (I'm speaking about "Escort", which is the first boss of wing 3).
---
Sorry for the lengthy post, and good luck!
---
There's too much backend work done here for this to be just for a weekend WvW event. This is absolutely clearly a test for something in the future. The issue is its not a true secondary class its just locked utility skills for a class and thus is too limited. I'll also add I don;t appreciate WvW being just a testbed for the rest of the game, there's a clear implication as to how WvW is regarded, mind you that was obvious already.
---
EU player. Got the game after seeing an angry joe review of the game and was looking to get into mmos. likes to do farming and hunt achievements
---
Rifle deadeye is amazingly spectacular in pretty much all game content now
---
I think this is a great idea especially when I see a lot of non-raid guilds starting beginner encounters. However I am concerned about the fact that if the 'monthly' rewards are exclusive, they may create some LFG "[xxx] is selling guild kills rn" where people are invited for the kill then paid.
---
wvw
---
Thankfully we do not.it has nothing to do with the game's philosophy and would totally ruin things for me personally
---
Because there’s WvW and PvP as separat game modes. No need to gank lower level or inexperienced players in PvE. I‘d suggest you play games that offer open world PvP.
---
MM has no direct control of the minions. There are a million kiting opportunities in PvE that an MM can't take advantage of.
---
Oh damn thats awesome! My friend wanted to join me but hes F2p so id love to give this to him if i win :)
---
I mean i thought it was fairly obvious. By the time a condi composition ramps up over time and starts actually doing damage. The power comp would have phased the boss already and moved on.
---
Started on release of the base game and stayed for WvW. Now my GF got into it a bit but only has base game +HoT. :)
---
And this right here, ladies and gentlemen, is what highlights the subjective nature of the "community".
---
You like PPT, other like Fighting, neither want to coexist.  Salt gets thrown. (And don't pretend that salt came only from one side) and a server falls.
---
The biggest problem I have is that some of the recent weapon sets we had released take a huge amount of work (Dragonsblood weapons in EP5 for instance) but are far worse than your average Black Lion skins. I wish the work reflected the quality of the skins but is rarely the case. 
---
PvP weapons for instance are another example. A lot of work for average weapons at best. Some of the legendaries look less awesome than some of the black lion skins.
---
I think having some weapon skins be as nice black lions weapons would not hurt the sales. People will always want more variety and more choices so they will always sell, whether or not we have other good sets obtainable through normal pve content.
---
I took the Material costs straight from Tradingpost. Thats their worth if you sell them instead!
---
Also EU here! 
---
Actually got the chance to play all the way back in beta after a friend from WoW recommended me to sign up as it would be an amazing game. He unfortunately didn't end up liking it, but I stuck around. I think the things that really appealed to me were the vastly different combat, with dodges (and enemies that dodged, although that's gone! :c), how tagging mobs and quest progress can be shared among randoms instead of being first come first served and the personal story that is actually engaging and easy to follow. 
---
I'm sure there were a lot of other reasons as well, but the story is actually something I really started to enjoy, and I've noticed since that games with a story that make me care for it are the ones I end up sticking with.
---
Honestly tho we're all Braham in this situation
---
It looks like a starting zone rifle.
---
Just like the hammer devs could have done something but chose not to.
---
guilds are yet another symptom of the utter mismanagement that has plagued gw2 since its inception.
---
as far as my opinion of fashion wars go, 
---
we could do chop up some outfits into pieces.
---
BUT most importantly would probably dyeing back items. No I am not convinced it's impossible because of coding limitations, not since pof came out with mounts and anet since release saying that's also mechanically impossible. there are back item packages that come with gliders and back items, you can dye the glider but not the back item. It is frustrating to no end.
---
From UE, I can tell you this is much appreciated. I would be so happy to win one. I'm a huge fan since gw1 and do not own PoF unfornatly. Hope you can change my situation and get me an account a real fan deserves.
---
Uhhh, I would consider both of those joke weapons.
---
thank you. such a massive help at times its unbelievable. Love this
---
A thing - char model limit/quality doesnt mean it will reduce the armor and texture quality of your own char. It just turns everyone else into the basic default model, which makes the game perform better as there's much less visual clutter o.o
---
Doesnt matter if you kill all raid bosses in 4h or 7 days if you get the loot once per week
---
It does from a roleplayers perspective. And going to pvp or wvw and trying to rp a duel there is a sure fire way to get roflstomped by people who don't care what we were trying to do.
---
hardcore as in 0 deaths?
---
&gt;A tool for creating and displaying **really easy to follow 3D routes** over the game, that even supports dealing with (the often ignored) renown hearts.
---
Right, that's totally hardcore mode.
---
Yes, basically.  Good summary of feelings held by many of us. :(
---
I think you're pretty great tbh, thank you for your hard work
---
Is that a bot or something? I reported it anyway...
---
meteorlogicus and exordium?
---
What a legend! These sounds like fantastic additions, particularly the distance option!
---
UW stacking much lately ?
---
&gt; If you ask for a stack of li or a bunch of kp, make sure the squad you have can perform to the standard you are demanding
---
This can never be fullfilled. A random com inviting random players who ping the required li/kp is never a 100% good group.
---
Update for you all:
---
It's perfectly playable (for me, anyway). I've only been in Ascalon so far, but I'm hovering around 20, and I'm not noticing any major lag or unplayableness.
---
Model limit is at lowest, and everything else is on medium or low. The FPS doesn't improve if I set everything else to low, just model limit.
---
It's not that people are unaware, It's that you're wrong.
---
Console limitations only affect PC limitations if the developers don't bother to build proper visual scaling for PC. A console running PC equivalent settings of med/high at 30fps 900p doesn't prevent higher framerate, higher resolution and the addition of ultra settings including higher model/texture and animation details.
---
&gt; you think game devs couldn't make their games look way better if they didn't have to make it playable on console too? 
---
This is where you are making the mistake. Even when you consider games that are made with PC in mind ***first*** they still have to make it able to run on lower end systems. They work to make it playable on console equivalent hardware *is already being done.*
---
Plenty of titles already look "way better" on PC than console. The only limiting factor really is CPU limited gameplay logic which is limited by the range of PCs consumers have as much as consoles and for the most part the lower framerate targets on console eliminate this issue, Anything GPU based is inherently scalable from hardware like the switch up to the bleeding edge of GPU's.
---
As usual, nice work anet. At least u made some money on wvw server stacking :).
---
Err, what? You know you can make a private server to pvp or jump into eotm and duel there (and you can probs duel on zerg island without being interrupted on alpine bls). 
---
I also see no advantage for pve balance in an arena for rp purposes. Fights are much shorter since dmg is much higher. Idk about you but there not much room to rp if you get blown up
---
Disagree, rifle is one of the rarest weapons to use, off the top of my head only deadeye and engi use it, and gen 2 legendaries are too much work compared to gen 1 so everyone just goes for the predator if they want one
---
Idk man it doesn’t make sense to have raid/fractal/dungeon enterances in guild halls. It’s called the aerodrome because you fly to the raid areas. The fractal hub is a consortium thing and I’m sure they don’t wanna share their little ‘themepark’. Dungeons happen exactly where they’re located. Wouldn’t make sense for me to enter a door in guild halls and suddenly be in ascalon.
---
Why does no one expect a tatoo artist to be able to draw straight lines?
---
Tbh , after anet killed half wvw servers, nothing.  :/
---
Good to know!
---
Actually, Intel cpus with amd integrated graphics exist

---
Cute :3

You forgot warrior. But if gen 2 was not silly, people would do it instead of gen 1
---
&gt;It is not designed as a gvg arena. thats in pvp customs. Its far to small for anything gvg even in a 5 vs 5 situation its too small. So no its not a gvg arena. It never was.
---
Excuse me what? Gvg in pvp customs? Do you have any idea what you're talking about? The guild hall arena is a perfectly fine size for 10 man scrims.
---
Started playing Guild Wars 1 from the start. Rushed home from middle school &amp; would sit at the computer for hours on end. My love of Guild Wars 2 has continued that ritual. Unfortunately, due to situations life has thrown at me, I have not been able to play any of the expansions. Thanks for this opportunity OP. Cheers to you.
---
Yeah, I'm saying they're both joke weapons. I own meteorologicus myself, and while I love it, I fully accept that it's a joke.
---
I think you might be missing the point though. The fact that these weapons are really detailed  doesn't make them serious weapons.
---
Shooting someone with an entire pirate ship is something you'd see in a Month Grail comedy. Same goes for attacking someone with a rainbow, or a diagram of the solar system. THAT'S what makes then joke weapons, even as cool as they are.
---
&gt; they still have to make it able to run on lower end systems
---
which is *exactly* what consoles are. pre-built, lower end systems with pre-programmed software sold for a premium due to their branding. a person buying a console could buy a low end pc for less and still get a higher performance machine, which would be the low end that devs would have to account for if consoles did not exist, leaving everyone with a prettier game. alas, this is not the case.
---
Man would be cool if you could mount and the mount would also be a giant
---
They said that LS5 is going  to come with everything an Xpac normally  does, so Elite Specs or new features are a very real possibility.
---
That said yeah, their silence on what next season will entail, as well as when it will be coming out, is concerning. There's just too much we don't know about what is happening with the company and the games direction right now.
---
Love it  =D
---
Just accept that pug's a hit or miss.
---
&gt;I'm not saying amazingly good to ME, I'm saying in-general as an example. 300 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. To watch every video on Youtube would take more time than a human being that lived to be 100 would be alive for (and that's assuming they stayed posted to a screen 24/7, never slept, never got up to use the bathroom, and never gone senile). But were're talking about a platform like Twitch, one where videos are deleted after so much time. It's even more likely that good creators could slip through the cracks there. It's just a fact of life. Good content/work is overlooked sometimes.
---
this is why a search function exists, so you do not have to watch every single minute of gameplay or footage ever recorded of a game to find something relevant to what you want. that's the way it goes, good streamers still get overlooked and forgotten, however, as you said, their videos all get deleted so no one benefits from them. streaming is also a lot easier than making high quality youtube videos as you don't have to edit, research, put as much effort in etc so there is an abundance of good to "okay" streamers compared to youtube content creators. 
---
&gt;Every single game that has benefited from people playing their games and streaming it. Surgeon Simulator, Five Nights at Freddy's, Skate Series, MINECRAFT, etc. It is earned media. Bringing more viewship of GW2 means it's more potential for people to find something that interests them with the game or makes them curious enough to play it.
---
again you are saying stuff but you aren't backing it up. any popular game will have both streamers **and** youtubers playing it, among many other sites publicising or talking about the game, it's impossible to figure out exactly what percentage is coming from where without a carefully controlled study.
---
&gt;Except some WILL. It's casting a wide net and doing one of the most important thing to get people hooked; to give your content a chance.
---
some will, most won't. the "some" in this situation are most likely less than 10 % of the people who came for free loot.
---
&gt;And yet it's still a significant number on a platform that is steadily rising on popularity. "100 million unique monthly users". Beyond that it offers potentially a different demographics who might not want to get on Reddit or who don't look at GW2 stuff normally just happen across a GW2 stream because they saw it trending higher than usual.
---
possibly, but doubtful. of that "100 million", being generous with an estimate, probably less than 1 million will be interested in watching MMO content. we all know where the majority of those viewers are going. fortnite, pubg, dota, mobas and battle royales. 
---
&gt;And they could do stuff on Youtube too. It's not exclusive to just Twitch, it's just that Twitch is easier to manage that kind of promotional stuff with Twitch given the way that platform has been designed.
---
twitch is easier yet anet have shown in the past that they are incapable of competently running third party promotion, knowing them it would turn into another PR disaster. 
---
&gt;Not everyone uses guides. Plus having someone you can watch and interact with is just massivley better. You can actually ask questions that they or the chat can potentially answer. Or other people can ask questions/input that you didn't even think to ask about.
---
have you been on twitch? as soon as the stream starts getting a lot of viewers, that kind of stuff doesn't happen anymore. it's just spamming emotes, laughing at the streamers failures etc. sure what you mention would work on small channels with less than 1000 viewers, but that's less than a thousand people.
---
&gt;Not everyone is comfortable asking in game. Some people are more comfortable watching a video or asking on a stream. Plus a stream allows you to watch what's going on and they can kinda mouse to things or show you the stuff more clearly than talking to people in chat.
---
true, again it won't make much of a difference if it's a small channel though.
---
&gt;So? More rewards isn't exactly a bad thing.
---
focusing more on the game itself rather than promotion and putting those rewards *in* the game would be a far better solution, especially for player retention. as it is, we haven't been getting a whole lot of unique, cool stuff that isn't on the gem store or in some ridiculously bad promotion that is limited to a single country.
---
Good stuff. There are certainly deader and longer abandoned corners of the game. But the GH could be much more of a hub for guild life.  
---
Mine’s only used for node mining, cashing in guild mission currency whose name I can’t remember right now, a mustering point for missions, and building sadistic jumping puzzles that no god in any of the infinite universes could complete without mounts or falling 23 million times (I’m not bitter). 
---
Could be much more.
---
I don’t think you should be telling people what they should do. GW2 is after all a “play how you want” game. If they want to ask all that li, if they want to expect certain feats from you and if you want not to oblige...everyones behaviour is correct and when you get kicked, that’s on you...
---
Woohoo!
---
By that logic, all Legendaries are joke weapons.
---
A lot of work goes into these, and they are honestly all very cool from an artistic perspective.
---
In your case condi is perfectly because your group doesn't burn the boss as fast as those &lt;30mins groups for both cms, and therefore condi has time to ramps up. To sum up senpaiofthemists's point: If u are looking for an exp group(I will say 50+Ess), power is your way to go since most people who play at this level will use power to phase the boss down extremely fast. If u are looking for like okay group that allows condi to ramps up, then feel free to play condi, condi is fine if your group can't burst the boss fast enough.
---
**BUT** I will always suggest to play power in fract, assuming that u will play condi in cms for a long time, it is most likely that u will join a more exp group and condi will have trouble here, then u might have to learn other power classes and u dont want that.
---
Considering they're for an entire guild, they aren't that expensive.
---
No idea :/ People should do more research before deciding on their artist. But if OP is happy with it...
---
In open world PvE? It really can't: you need new weapons and new skills to open up a new way to play to game.
---
It's just bad luck, I do world comp frequently and the keys are still there. Got some yesterday
---
In fairness, there are nodes, discounts and buffs and access through a portal to include guildies that don't have maps in missions. We have made race tracks and fun places in our guild hall. My guild is strong and flourishing for going on 7 years now. It isn't what the game brings to the guild. It's what the guild brings to the game that makes a difference. All of that said, here are some more additions I'd like to see. I suck at formatting so any help is appreciated. Please feel free to correct and repost for me if this turns into a wall of text (appreciated).
---
1.	**Placeables** This area in the guild pane needs to be separated to the categories it is comprised of in the available rank permissions. So “Use Placeables” should be replaced by “Use Banners” “Use Misc.”, “Use Siege” and “Use Guild Deco” (this last one gives those with the perm on their rank the perm to use the placeable deco to advance scribing, not to decorate). Here is why I need this. I want to encourage a brand new member to the guild to pursue scribe crafting if they want and allow use of decorations (which is a placeable) to them for advancing crafting. I want to allow use of consumables meaning Banners, Misc. and Siege (placeables) to higher ranked guild members only. Right now if you add the “Use Placeables” permission to a rank it is all or none and it governs all of them. The 4 categories of Storage need to be separated for the purposes of assigning permissions to use them to appropriate ranks.
---
2.	**Assembly Device is a hostage situation**: Allow me to type in how many of an item on the left panel I want to put into the assembly device. If I need a stack of catapults I am currently hostage to stand there and load that machine for an entire evening. I don’t care if it takes the same amount of time to produce them. Just don’t make me stand there.
---
3.	**Customizable Esa / Workshop Proprietor Panel**: I'd like to see a panel added to the workshop proprietor that includes every material required for every guild deco. The guild bank would have a panel added to hold all of this material looking much like your personal materials storage. When a guild leader checks an item in the list at the Workshop Proprietor it then shows on Esa the Frugal’s panel. Guildies would see just those items needed in his window and be able to donate into the guild hall vs sending them to a person. Also, things that are needed like the gift of exploration, that can't be mailed, can still be donated using this feature for scribe crafting. Once added, the items are free to be used for deco crafting just like the placeable deco are available. Once your guild hall is built you have all of these vendors hanging around that server virtually no purpose. I’d like to see them have some ongoing value if they are going to take up space.
---
4.	Add an **NPC exclusively to guild halls** that trades Black Lion items for other Black Lion items. Specifically, Black Lion Salvage Kits, Black Lion Trading Posts, Repair Canisters, Merchant Expresses, Bank Access Expresses, Upgrade Extractors, and any of the Passes. I want to be able to trade any one of these items for any one of another or one for a Black Lion Statuette so I can select an item that will be useful for me when I have a permanent version of one of these or just to many of any of one
---
5.	**Guild Kite Vendor** has been missing in action for years. I have about 30 remaining Guildies who still have the illustrious guild kite with our emblem on it. These made excellent gifts to Guildies during holidays and guild celebrations….guild kites are sadly missed. Why was this ever removed and why isn't in the guild hall????
---
6.	Add **festival music** to guild hall music selections. We already have SAB music, but we don’t have Winter’s Day, Lunar NY or Halloween music to select as an option.
---
7.	**Guild Hall Arena**: The Arena gives the impression it is pvp based considering all of the pvp mats required to advance it, but, it’s not….it’s PvE. Considering all of those pvp items needed consider a toggle to allow players to use the arena in pvp mode using their pvp build.
---
8.	**Guild slot expansion** Adds 1 - 5 - or 10 guild slots to an account. (I would like to keep my main big guild, but join 10 more that farm stuff or more than one specialty guild like raid, pvp, or other. This is the same as the addition of character slots on my account only I can now be in more guilds
---
9.	**Permanent Guild Hall instance expander** Allow me to apply the change to a guild I lead and will permanently expand the instance of my guild hall to 50/100/150. I want all of my guildies to be able to get into the same instance and not have to leave and reenter to accomplish it. When we are running group events in the guild hall it is such a dis-satisfier to have to stop everything because the instance is changing to accommodate one arriving 5.	Guild Rank Expander: Person with the rank Guild Leader can add 10 more customizable player ranks in guild pane in addition to the 10 already there. The number of permissions has grown over time to currently 32 permissions to apply to ranks but there were no additions of Rank Slots to support those additional Roles these permissions could support. I like to advance ranks of my guildies to add unique responsibilities. I also like to apply ranks at times to groups of guildies just for fun.
---
10.	**Interactive Scribe Deco License** so that 400 Level Scribe Creations in my guild hall are interactive and functional for any repping guild member. Some examples: Winter’s Day Trees should each be gatherable for a gift during the time the festival is active….or all year for that matter if we want to keep them out somewhere. The globe (of disappointment) should list differing waypoints weekly, one per each world map. Guildies can go to that waypoint on interacting with the globe. The cornstalks should have candy corn gatherable. The snowmakers should allow gathering of snowflakes. If the guild is willing to produce the mats to make these very expensive items I’d like to see the items give back…slowly. To control the farm, allow only the first x number of interactive creations placed to function (hate this actually, I'd like to have as many as I want, but I get it. I liken this to buying the ability for making and placing our own nodes.
---
11.	**Favor Convertor** I LOVE that guildies can choose their buffs at the tavern based on what they are doing. I'd like to buy a favor convertor that can be permanently applied to the guild panel that will allow me to spend our favor earned from missions to increase the number of buffs they can carry at a time instead of just using it for banners. If I toggle this feature that I have bought to "ON" (checked) in the guild pane, the favor would come out of our favor stash for the week at mission reset. If there is not enough favor to support the license purchased (3 buffs =500 favor, 5 buffs=1000 favor, 9 buffs= 1500 favor), then you will revert to just being able to take the default 1 buff and your favor will accumulate until you reach the amount needed to support the buff. During times when you know you want to stack your favor up for anticipated guild hall additions you can uncheck it to turn it off and allow your favor to build up
---
&gt; If all we are getting are new maps,
---
That's exactly the opposite of what they told us. LS5 will be different, have some patience, jeez.
---
Don't worry, I'll cast you a line. Why are you fishing for down-votes, anyway?
---
Surprise Mechanics, bay-beeeeee!
---
With how little this post made sense, I'm inclined to believe a bot drafted it.
---
You're not demanding any standard since people have been carried or bought raids.
---
You're literally asking for a currency - Some people who have that currency are not that great but they have it.
---
Thank you so much!
---
No but instead of death threat we downvoted his video and as a community explained to him how the game works allowing him to make another video that isn't so much WoW orientated.
---
Why do you have to post passive aggressive shit instead of just upvoting the poster and moving on? It always has to be some quip, it's so fucking weird. Especially since they're the most upvoted comment in the thread, which is why you saw their comment first.
---
I will back you up on this. Love the idea, but poor work.
---
Very good point. It makes Durmand Priory is more secretive than the not-so secretive Order of Whispers.
---
&gt; Guardian main-hand shield
---
That would  be funny but doubtful ... unless they want to go and adjust all crafting cost of shields as well. Bigger problem is the visuals for stowing two shields.
---
when i commented it was somewhere in the middle, but glad its on the top now
---
I've tried all of them an I enjoy elementalist the most, because it's *more* engaging to play. 
---
It's fine if you don't enjoy it, but that still doesn't mean the class design is bad. After all, plenty of people still play it.
---
Are you prepared for all the people that are going to follow you everywhere?
---
More people crafted the birthday cake candle? Thats surprising
---
you have to keep in mind one important thing for fractals, if you play with a chrono you have to maintain 25might stacks, and most likely help out with fury/protection and don't remember exactly but p sure u don't maintain 25might as a scrapper. if you play with alac ren or quickbrand ur basically useless too becuase you don't give quickness or alac.
---
Heal scrapper isn't anywhere close to meta for t4's and/or cm's because it basically only brings healing, which is only the secondary role of "healers" in most groups while the primary role is buffing.
---
But if u only want one gear set, I'd say minstrel cause it's more usefull in WvW and gearing up a class for content where it super niche isn't super worth it as first/only set.
---
World bosses have several problems. They need a lot of people and there already complains that it is too hard to gather 10 people for raids. You would need a force spawn for all bosses, because the current timed schedule is very restricting. For a organized group you need to gather 30 if not more on the map to be able to join in on the correct instance. If the difficulty is high enough to require organized maps to kill it, it means that a lot of people just won't do it. Nearly everyone considers TT a waste of time for example. Maybe that also has to do with rewards. Getting on a organized map or organizing it and then not getting anything worthwhile for the comparable huge effort isn't something that draws in a lot of players.
---
there comes a point where they just have to upgrade parts
---
I read the suggestion somewhere that challenge mode bosses should get their own weekly chest/reward. Currently they are do once for the achievement and then never do them again.
---
Reworking ranger dagger offhand and reducing DH longbow 5 cooldown in pve would be good for a start.
---
i would consider exordium less as a joke weapon than the previews three GS that are just ugly 2D reskins of one another
---
Unfortunately, according to the devs dyeing your weapons is impossible in the current state of the games code. Would probably be easier to just ask them to release recolors of weapons.
---
Here comes [Char](https://youtu.be/irgxJlcTbvI)~    owo…
---
My problem with this is the people with 6+ hours will also farm these and make more gold. Pumping more gold into the economy will always make those who have a lot of money continue to have more and inflate things further. They will decide to complete legendaries rather than flip them which drives base mat rates up. They also see that they can sell things for more because they will have more base money.
---
Folks need to stop whining about the straight lines on the tatt. OP is happy -- that's all that matters.
---
With that kind of negativity, you all will never get close enough to a woman's neck to notice the details anyway.
---
power quickbrand does the exact same thing as condi quickbrand, except more burst (which is must in half decent groups) and the extra pull of gs5, but no clue if condi qb has a pull.
---
It's kind of comically oversized, and it's literally a boat that has a big cannon for a nose on a small stick for a butt. Sure, it's super detailed. But it's a cannon with a small stock and a ship-in-a-bottle built around it. In comparison, the other legendary rifle is a sniper.
---
Meteorlogicus looks silly, more like a weird curio that you'd put in your house than a weapon. I don't know exactly how you'd make a scepter look like it's supposed to be a weapon anyway, since they're not real.
---
Take off the rainbow gleam on it, and exordium looks like an actual weapon. Plus, it morphs as if to enhance attacks. The rainbow gleam may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the weapon itself is designed like it's supposed to be one.
---
uhm yes and a decent meta power group does both cm's and all t4's in that time. You basically proved the point why he doesn't want condi in fractals.
---
I don't mind, I block the com (if he's bad too) and his friend and leave the squad. Vast majority of my blocklist are raiders from this and guild groups from only one nationality that had people doing 30-50% of my dps on stuff like KC. Rather play with leeches once and block them so I can avoid them later on than to keep running into them in random pugs. Sadly it saves a lot of time when pugging to know when to insta leave certain squads instead of trying 3-4pulls, but guess that's elitist for some people /s
---
Wow. It looks awesome!!!
---
ty, removed them
---
Hey. There are plenty of women with low enough standards to sleep with me.
---
Pls, give this man a huge applause 👌
---
I mean, I don't approve of them being rude to her either... but why the weird tie back to sex?  I'm going to let you in on a secret.   Assholes get laid. lol
---
Agreed. The other day I was doing QadimP CM with some guildies and filled the rest up with pugs. One of the guildies hadnt raided alot recently, had only done qadim once, so we let him be the off chrono.
---
After 4 pug chronotanks, he suggested to be the tank instead and after 2 runs of getting into it he  outperformed all the previous tanks before him.
---
The LFG is basically a slot machine of quality, having atleast that KP filter over it already weeds out part of the bad. For my guildies that I know of that they know how to play their role, that filter obv isnt needed.
---
Amazing work!
---
One question, is there a option to disable every mod at once. And even if I do it by hand, enabling just 1 seems to trigger everything because you need to enable the group of that makes sense.
---
I often have information overload when just trying to do 1 thing and then spend a lot time configuring.
---
If a group asks for more than just 'be exp' or the commander hounds you for pings you already know it's going downhill fast.
---
WoW BfA was trending first on twitch, they even outnumbered League of Legends and fortnite for some time.
---
Can people legally *cat call* you now?

I was playing FFXIV just now, tanking a dungeon when the healer and 2 dps started to flame each other for one missed interrupt. Going on and on about how the other one is "retarded" and should "learn to play" etc. And pretty much the majority of the player base are cringy weebs. But all in all it's pretty much the same as any other mmorpg, not more or less toxic, just as toxic as the rest.
---
But he skipped the leveling because it was terrible xd yeah maybe he shouldnt have commented on the story but imo he has full right to criticize the leveling, he tried it, it was bad and he bought a skip to experience the other elements of the game
---
Please don't do this for Fractals either.
---
Thank you for this.  It made farming map currencies for Vision bearable.
---
You're still focusing on visual settings far too much.
---
&gt;  it's far cheaper to replace a couple of parts than it is to buy a brand new console and it's good practise to upgrade every couple of years depending on what you start with. 
---
It can be depending on initial hardware choices, although nobody was disputing the value of PC gaming. In the cases were this is true though you're looking at purely GPU bound visual options. In modern engines these are completely interchangeable and supporting lower end GPU's in no way negatively affects visuals on the high end.
---
Once again, The only aspects consoles or lower end systems are holding back what games are capable of is with intensive CPU tasks intrinsically linked to gameplay. These are few and far between and in many cases consoles have an advantage over budget gaming PCs because they're reliant on core count over IPC and budget PC's are running only 2-4 threads.
---
Other CPU bound tasks that are visual based also scale easily enough which is why we see higher shadow detail, animation, NPC count and draw distances than console.
---
Machine learning assisted enemy AI will be a big thing in the future but multiplayer games are better handling that server side and by the time the whole PC market catches up to the performance requirements of doing it locally for single player the upcoming console generation will be old.
---
Any issues caused by slower or lower memory can be handled with decent memory management and mostly don't cause a problem because the other components mean consoles are targeting 30fps, significantly easing memory bandwidth requirements.
---
If you're so adamant this is the case. List some examples of things games could do differently if developers didn't have to consider the current gen consoles during development that would be impossible otherwise but doesn't require the absolute bleeding edge systems only.
---
That's exactly what it was created for originally, only back in the HoT days it was noxious pods :)
---
Killer queen's bites the dust!
---
Yes, but in open world PvE, those things are completely usable. Lowering the cooldowns will not open up something new: it's simply going to mean you will kill things a bit faster ...
---
I too will choose either the Grove or the Olmakhan. XD 
---
+ Olmakhan village is my favorite part of LS4 as well as the introduction part. &lt;3 I can never forget the defenders and the cubs running freely on 4 limbs around the village.
---
Killer Queen has already tagged that event
---
I guess I'm not cool enough to understand the intricacies of tatooing, but boy do I like this! I hope maybe you meet some new guild warriors as a result :D
---
&gt; Wvw
---
Neglected content.
---
&gt; PVP 
---
Pushed aside for living world. Entire game modes abandoned.
---
&gt; fractals
---
CMs are dead. Haven't had a new fractal in a long, loooong time.
---
By the way, guilds themselves are dead content too. In a game called *Guild Wars 2!*
---
GW2 is now just a cash sop trap for simple whales who get emotionally invested because of living world. That's why they spend so much time and money on one time instances you never play again.
---
AMAZING tyvm for this your addons is a must to have always forever and ever!!!
---
pd: is there a way  to apply a keybind to activate and deactivate taco?
---
Weird, when i set the setting to off, everything disappears. 
---
Also, if that doesn't help, shit it off in the journal, too
---
Gw2 map completion is so simple. Go for cartographer in Tyria in GW1...
---
I don't agree with him, but wvw, pvp and fractals are in an equally bad state right now
---
They just don't get enough attention
---
This is what I came here expecting.
---
EQ2 did housing really well. I wish GW2 could go that direction. I used to buy all sorts of building items, novelties, furniture, pets, and more from EQ2s shop for housing.
---
My greatest "like" for the Charr, is they bent, and mostly, Anet gave the industrial engineering setting to the most unlikely feral races.
---
Ty for port!
---
Oh no, the tag is gone. We're lost sheeps. Bah. Bah.
---
Keys still drop.  I map completed Caledon Forest on a lark yesterday and got a key.
---
Opened the worst chest I've opened in years, though.  T5 crafting materials bag and a Metabolic Primer.
---
Wvw power reaper build with marauder and dura ruins still hit decently for its spec in PvE and can take a fuck ton of hits back.
---
It's the perfect game for you then because there's nothing to do
---
There are huge differences in CM groups that require no ess, 50 ess, 100 ess, 250+ ess. No ess usually means the group is fairly new and you likely wont get the CM kills--they are basically normal frac groups trying to break into CM. 50 ess are the ones who broke into it, but will still be hit or miss, with a greater miss chance. 100 ess is probably where you want to set your LFG as these people should know what they are doing or are experienced groups that want to fill with a reasonably competent person. 250+ ess groups are just jerks, that is a ridiculous amount of ess (to my knowledge, there is only one or two NA groups that require 250+ and at least one has 2 of the nastiest--while also sucking hard, they were still running dru/chr for a long time passed the meta--people in them).
---
Ok, but this thread is about keeping the guild member who obviously sucks way more than everyone else to the point of being uncarryable. You're just wasting everyone's time at that point.
---
Can confirm - Engis with permenant Elixer S are ruining WvW.
---
TacO is a standalone application and can't really have a "keybind" to start it up, so no there's no such thing.
---
As for marker packs, I haven't exactly kept track of what's out there lately, Tekkit's stuff is pretty solid, and there's a big french collection of markers here https://www.heinze.fr/taco/
---
If you have to ask then no. The should sell itself to you. Not your job to find reasons to play.
---
Autosave of what exactly?
---
Taco saves its settings "on exit" is there way to make it save its settings right away or have the option to save settings. Sometimes people just shut everything down without "properly" exiting taco so their settings don't save.   
---
like this user was experiencing

... don't use snowflake like that, ffs. People criticizing art are not being overly sensitive, they're giving their opinion and they're entitled to it. You posted it here, in public; presumably you want to know what the public thinks of it, yes? 
---
I'm glad you're happy with it. You should be, it's yours, regardless of what anyone else says. But at the same time, don't disparage people who dont share your opinion (unless they're being hateful or abusive, obviously, I'm talking about respectful comments here).

I'll put it on the todo.

The only thing i had left was me thinking i was good on griffin. Now i can quit.
---
This is magic.

Tekkit makes the guids i dont think BoyC makes many marker packs
---
What is even worse, that currency is meant to actually be used, not keeped in inventory.
---
That's fair
---
Personally i would have gone for an artist that knows what he/she is doing. not some guy that ordered a tattoo gun from wish 3 weeks ago and calls himself a tattoo artist now. 
---
But as long as you are happy  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You really need minstrels for wvw, here's a guide for it if you're interested: https://youtu.be/FGjqMpBME5c
---
That’s a new tattoo, a lot of what’s making those lines look inconsistent is going to fall off when it heals.
---
It might still not be straight?  But it’s certainly going to look better when it heals.
---
I was roaming yesterday with two other guys and we did fine; ran into some others who wiped us, but we made significant progress. No holosmiths, so it wasn’t a big deal. That being said, I was playing late, so there probably wasn’t a significant WVW population to play against.
---
It just depends on how you’re running, I’m guessing. I was incredibly successful yesterday - but then again, that won’t be the same story for everyone.
---
Without knowing what vMA is exactly, the Queen's Gauntlet in the upcoming Festival of Four Winds is a series of solo opponents that start out fairly easy but evolve into stronger challenges that force you to learn strategies and perhaps change your build in order to triumph.  That content should be coming sometime around the end of July, if it holds true to last year's schedule.
---
Stop right here. Current consoles are sold for 199€ on sale. I challenge you to build a system as capable as that for 199€.
---
Spoiler: it’s impossible unless you start buying used parts.
---
The schedule and locations are available on Wiki: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_Bash_Hologram_Stampede!
---
It's part of the problem, though, it's not the whole problem.
---
Great, thank you!
---
Fractals and Dungeons (that are kinda decomissioned and replaced by fractals but still exist) are made to be done by a group of 5 players and some skilled player like to solo them for the challenge.
---
Yeah I build the platform, Tekkit and others create the content :)
---
Support scrapper is ideal for WvW but not so great for fractals and raids. I wouldn't make a barrier set for heal scrapper, just because you will be lackluster in both WvW (because meta is minstrel) and PvE (because there are better things). You can carry people in dungeons though with minstrel scrapper. When making your decision taking into account what you will get the most out of is important. Minstrel scrappers are hard meta for WvW. You can play this in guild groups. If you play a decent amount of WvW or are looking to get into Minstrel scrapper would be great. As far as more advanced PvE goes you will always be lesser to a druid, or quickbrand.
---
Just so you know: this screenshot shows what is probably your first name.
---
*Literally* unplayable?
---
Actually it does. Good and bad are subjective. That's why an orphan child in Syria can happily bash two rocks together, sitting in the bombed ruins of its parents house, while some western child is depressed and commits suicide.
---
You can use fixed numbers to determine whether something is good or bad, but in a sea of blind men, the one-eyed is still king. Same goes for a video on a hot page full of screenshots.
---
Wait until you see my HARD light arena :^)
---
I recently got done with a commission piece for one of my guildies. She just got an old Rytlock statue that she really loved and I offered to try my hand at a repaint to make it really pop and shine. Let me know what you think, hopefully you all enjoy it as much as she does.
---
Here's to you Bliss! &lt;3
---
You can maintain the might, fury and enough protection to let the chrono take care of the rest.
---
But it is a core build, finicky and the only benefit is better cleanse and slightly better heals (having to run pack runes hurts).
---
The griffon is one of the best things that could happen to GW2.
---
Hope there will be more Griffon Adventures in the future.
---
By your comparison you disprove yourself. Both are bad thing. Just because the syrian kid has it bad doesn't mean that the western kid has it good suddenly. Both a very valid problems, both are bad, both need to be dealt with
---
&gt; 2. thing is to Kill a enemie near Thunderhead Keep (Achiev done also Check in Main Achievment)
---
Dude, what enemy. I've been all over the area killing stuff and I've for the vision crystal in the bag.
---
I have done both around the times they came out, and I feel like vision was easier but that is because the skyscale is a large part of the work.
---
wouldnt a better comparison be for HMS divinity to The Predator? plus hammers and rifles are used in fewer builds than other weapons.
---
Of all skills to implement from Engi, they decided that Elixir S, the single most abusable and boosted skill in the Engi's arsenal makes the cut.
---
MEANWHILE WE GET SCORPION WIRE FROM THIEVES LMAO. 
---
Shadowstep? Nah.
---
Any of the traps? Nah nah.
---
How bout some other tricks? Nope, absolutely not.
---
SCORPION WIRE THO.
---
I can't believe there's so much venomous hate in this thread.
---
There's nothing wrong with disliking a legendary. Everyone likes different things, some things are more popular than others, and that's totally fine. But the level of hatred here makes me wonder if this rifle personally visited half the playerbase, knocked on their doors, and shot whoever answered.
---
Congrats on your new legendary OP! It's not my favorite legendary, but I still think it's a pretty neat one, no matter what anyone says.
---
U rite lol
---
Personally I'd say Aurora.
---
Yeah technically it'll take longer because there's a minimum 16 day timegated item. But if you don't have the skyscale and don't have the timegated mats (charged quartz), the Vision will take longer than the minimum 3 days. 
---
Even if you want to bypass the timegated items and buy the skyscale food from the TP, it'll set you back a couple hundred gold. 
---
Coupled with the fact that the skyscale "journey" was so dull, I'd pick Aurora over Vision any day.
---
Unfortunately it is not a bug until Arenanet says so. Right now some people might even claim it is a feature. Yes it is clearly broken to most of us. I am hoping for a fix asap too, team of 3 holos just killed my group of 20.
---
Coalescence is just having PoF raids done. Aurora takes some grinding in the previous ls maps, which is going to be hard, low population. Vision is for the current season, a bit more grind, but easier due to high population of players who are doing the exact same shit you do xd
---
Why do you love it when you can't see it?  I'm not trying to be insulting... I'm personally not into tattoos.... so I don't see the appeal getting something inked on you forever, and especially one you can't see.
---
In Aurene 😝
---
Ahh, so the Significant Other knows where to stack. Got it. =D
---
Relaxing to watch great scenery thanks!
---
Damn you, gummi bears!
---
All you need is 24 keys before the meta in order to open every chest. Just do events before to lock in that number. Comb map for mistborn motes and consume those after the meta. Sell everything. Then buy trophy shipments with VM magic. Sell everything. 40g is an easy number to pull, 60g if you get lucky on drops.
---
I’d just like certain guild missions to be touched up, some of them *really* show their age, some of them are just anti-fun time sucks like Save Our Supplies or an exercise in annoyance and frustration like the 2-MULT or Yanonka bounties. And why is it that ANYONE in the guild can interact with a Trek location and (usually accidentally) ruin it for everyone by completing the Trek before everyone is at the location???
---
&gt;If you ask for a stack of li or a bunch of kp, make sure the squad you have can perform to the standard you are demanding
---
There is no correlation between LI/KP and "standards" so that entire sentence is meaningless nonsense. Just like pretending linking shit is useful in any way.
---
Mmm that's fair, to each their own. I don't need to see it all the time to know that it's there. I have my reasons for picking this and I'm happy just knowing I have it. It's also cute so if I want to see it I can just go to a mirror or use my phone to take a pic.
---
lmao
---
Sure that’s definitely true. But the op asked the best way and most efficient way to farm them.
---
what's the reason to work towards a griffin over skyscale? I didn't realize the griffin could do all this. (Asking as someone who hasn't started either.)
---
If you expect ANet to fix it during this events duration, you are mad.
---
If it was a farming exploit, it would already be fixed.
---
Amazing attention to detail! The armor looks incredible
---
NO WVW FOR YOU

I use taCO daily and as a fellow developer (in training) I appreciate you hard work and clean code. 🙌🏽

If I turn off the currently selected episode in the Journal, it just goes back to the earliest uncompleted story chapter of that character.

Unless you're a mod you can't tell if they are shadowbanned, they  might have posted something that got caught in an automod filter

[Gamersnexus](https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3489-amd-ryzen-5-3600-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-intel)
---
His reviews can be a bit long, but its justified because he does a great job at breaking down his testing methodology.  He runs a wide range of benchmarks based on real world usage. Scroll down half way for the graphs.
---
TLDR; Intel is still better for gaming. But its by such a small margin that it doesn't justify the increased cost. And they're being destroyed in almost every other real world application. R5 3600 is the go to budget cpu now.
---
Well, if you use it you can ping what you used it on hopefully.
---
Thread removed: Posting exploits is not allowed here, please report them to exploits@arena.net

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Can't be ingame atm, but have you added the new PoF metas to the timer yet? I keep missing them because they're not among the list with all the other timers! :(
---
It looks to me that they figured it out pretty soon, and waited for the weekend to exploit it knowing it'd be hard to get it fixed on the weekend. 
---
ANet may not be able to fix this ASAP, but they should definitely make an example of those who exploit such bugs.
---
Especially when the same cheaters throw siege at you for dodging them and refuse to fight them, as if they are proud of their exploits and feel that it is totally ok what they are doing.
---
Oh nice but why not pink? :P
---
PvP, Raids, WvW and CMs are been killed by those who claim the modes exclusively for themselves, complain about any new blood trying to enter the modes, enforce absurdly ridiculous gatekeeping, dismiss any feedback given by new players who are having trouble getting in, and engage in exploiting every gimmick they can find instead admitting how broken they are and how they need to be fixed or balanced out of existence, and quietly reporting bugs and exploits through the proper channels.
---
Even if what a newbie is wrong in what they say, you can still learn from their feedback, because whatever they say is wrong is telling you what the game is not properly showing to new players. 
---
If you actively and purposely engage in a cooperative effort to make the game mode hostile to new players, of course it'll end up dead.
---
But I guess it's easier shooting the messenger than taking the news with a Vial of Salt, uh?
---
Skills without cooldowns is a pretty obvious exploit...
---
Would've LOVED to get pink bc that's the tag I usually run but I felt red shows up nicer
---
Maby permanet marked would be nice
---
Don't you get Tiger Den Map for the tiger instance?
---
What kind of monster wants people to work on a sunday.
---
Vision requires the skyscale, as well as using gift of desert related materials which I dislike obtaining compared to jungle materials
---
I don't like Necro :( but I'll try to take a look all proffessions. Thanks!
---
How soft was his fur to your touch?
---
Well, we can't ping actual currencies.
---
People ping tokens. If those tokens were turned into an actual currency, you would not be able to ping it anymore, but then it'll still appear in the API.
---
An even if you give them a sink so juicy nobody in their right mind  would keep hoarding them instead using them, someone will figure out so other way to gatekeep.
---
Its never too late to start at Gw2 :P
---
I don't think I can love Necro :( What do u think about warrior with axes?
---
Aigt, cya
---
And kill off the WvW community even further? Great idea. Why not ban people that exploited raid CMs?
---
I wouldn’t say top creator
---
No; exotics are the second-best, stat-wise. Ascended and legendary are marginally better, but a single piece of ascended can cost as much as a full set of exotics, and a single piece of legendary can cost as more than multiple sets of legendary, with the added benefit of free (?) stat-swapping.
---
Exotics are also available at levels less than 80, and have worse stats than the lvl 80 variety, so be sure to double-check.
---
The TP armors mentioned above are less expensive than crafting your own if you haven't been working to gather the materials. That said, it's always worth it to start crafting so have access to those skills at the proficiencies needed for collections and whatnot.
---
"Basic" (white) &lt; Fine (blue) &lt; Masterwork (green) &lt; Rare (yellow) &lt; Exotic (orange) &lt; Ascended (pink) &lt; Legendary (purple)
---
Crafting basic stats like Berserkers is usually more expensive than just buying it off the TP. if you're not full exotic yet, get exotics before fucsing on ascended / legy.
---
It's not only holosmith, you can do the same on necro and with any special action, can infinitely refresh your new skills cooldowns and standard skills cooldowns, could even place 10 wells within a few seconds with necro
---
Baby come back, any kind of fool could see...
---
Same girl!!!!
---
Maybe OP thought it means "personal service announcement".
---
Pretty much every game mode rewards you with decent gold. Just play what you want, and you will get gold.
---
I'm afraid you're going to have to spent five months or something to unlock all the content. I mean, you're looking at 7+ years of delivered content. You will NOT blast through that in two weeks or something.
---
However, getting max level and endgame gear is piss easy and will happen quickly. After that you can slowly work on your progress gear if you want to, and/or just work through all the content. All seasons, all expansion packs, all the masteries. That's going to take quite a while. You can unlock a ton of ascended gear along the way, so you don't have to specifically farm for it. But since it doesn't go anywhere, you got all the time of the world and thank to GW2's progress being horizontal instead of vertical, your exotics will easily carry you through everything the game has to offer with exception of high level fractals. But at the end of the journey you're most likely going to have a ton of ascended gear anyway.
---
Mind you though, until you will have all the masteries, all the mounts, all the skills, quite some time WILL go by.
---
I think I shouldn't sell all of my crafting items yesterday :/ Umm, can you tell me which item is good for now if i send screenshots to you?
---
Consoles also loop you in to other monetization models like the PS, Microsoft store, or the Nintendo shop.  Since they're effectively monopolies on their home consoles, they can charge pretty steep prices for longer as there's not really any competition on the console and moving tends to cost a lot.  But yes, the entry level for consoles has gone down quite a bit.  The truth to the statement of the same cost PC being better than the same cost console is growing less true as time goes on and powerful PC parts become cheaper.
---
They never nerfed the Griffen?
---
IIRC Vision is easier, but more expensive, while Aurora takes longer, but is cheaper.
---
&gt; What do u think about warrior with axes?
---
I think it's hilariously fun and I run one on a regular basis. However, it's much more difficult than ranger or mm necro. 
---

---
Why do people expect tattoos to be picture perfect. I needs to be accurate, but 100% perfect tattoos are boring unless the meaning of something really depend on the shape
---
Exotic is the best you can get from the tp. Ascended is ~5% better, legendary is equal to ascended.
---
i got 98% and damned if i can find that last bit, i've studied maps in comparison but i just cant see it.
---
Thanks for the answer, I'm fine with the fact that forming my character takes some time at the end and after all it's fun. One of the reasons I would also play gw2 is to be able to play with people in a guild doing content together, little by little. But if the inflexible schedule and requirements of other MMO, as a second job.
---
From what I've read gw2 is not in good condition at the time, maybe it's also only written when things are bad, equally for me that's not a problem, lol is much more popular and yet I'm not encouraged to play it just because it's popular.
---
My fear is that being at the end of the life of this expansion, is still unlocking things from HoT and get another expansion so that I always stay behind, in other mmo simply to do the dungeon of your level and improve the equipment, then raids... But I don't know if here masteries, mounts and other things are more necessary. 
---
For example to be in a guild to go to make X and not to be able because I am the only one that does not have the faucet. As you say gw2 is an mmo with many years of life and it really overwhelms when entering all the objects that there are, options of the store, things to do ... if you start from 0 you are doing things with people, but if everyone has mounts, gliders, weapons and legendary weapons and you do not know anything you feel something lost and overwhelmed by the content.
---
&gt;I don't see the issue too much, the invuln doesn't let them attack you in anyway.
---
You don't see an issue with a guild group of 5 holosmiths being permanently invulnerable in a keep you just flipped?
---
----
---
The invun is because of the cooldown reset. It resets ALL cooldowns meaning any utility skill a holosmith can slot - They can spam.
---
It's not just Elixer S, They have permenant spectrum shield and Photon Wall when they do fight - Any utility skill they can get they can repeat over and over. They have permanent quickness, 25might.
---
Once they was not being focused they would spam light beam on cooldown, before you even recover from the knockdown you are knocked down again, The fields even overlap.
---
That's plenty for now.
---
Please stream it 24 hours straight and I'll listen.
---
&gt; And kill off the WvW community even further?
---
The people using these exploits ARE killing off the WvW community. Go fight a team of 5 holosmiths abusing the bug - See how long you last against it.
---
Majority are not exploiting this, The minority who are deserve to be punished.
---
If my guild was any smaller it wouldn't be a guild, and as I said I'm the only one who donates and yet it's perfectly doable.
---
I’d like to think that maybe people that dont play thief will realize that scorpion wire is trash, then speak up on the forums and maybe it could be buffed. 
---
But then I come back to reality, and know that people won’t give a shit because a lot of people just hate thief just for it being thief, even though its a trash class right now, and nothing will change.
---
Yes they have - https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bubqou/psa_the_event_timers_on_the_gw2_wiki_got_updated/epb5lvg/
---
GW2 is really well designed in that regard. You don't need any character development at all to play from start to the end of season 2. No gliders, no mounts, no specializations - nothing. You have all the time in the world and everything you need to enjoy the content.
---
However, if you want to progress faster - you can. No need to slog through all the episodes and all the content, you can just skip everything and just do the parts that reward you with the cool stuff, like mounts and gliders and an additional downed skill and whatnot. Then you're somewhat up to date and still can go back and do the regular content.
---
However you enjoy.
---
Right now we're at the end of season 4, and there is no third expansion planned. We'll directly move on to season 5. So you not only have quite some time to catch up, you can also take a bunch of shortcuts AND then still join in on everyone else with the start of season 5.
---
Woah this is pretty amazing :D   
---
You have a very good control. I would have gotten stuck on so many corners or edges. It took me some work to get the griffon races too haha, I hated it when I had to fly into caves or corridors. The skyscale catapult is nice though, I've also used mine a lot  to gain altitude for griffon speeding here and there.
---
Trash this equipment, its from your levelup reward - just trash it you won't loose anything... well you can't loose too since you can neither vendor or recycle it.
---
Second... well get to lvl80 first, maybe run Ascalon or some other easy dungeons!
---
First, as others have said, you'll want a full set of exotics with appropriate stats (depends on your build). These will let you participate in pretty much all end-game content without issue, and should be your first goal when you hit level 80 with a character. You can simply buy these on the TP, so it's nice and easy to get. Once you've got a decently geared character, you can enjoy much of the game without worrying about money and having to spend anything. 
---
After that, I'd say just save up. You're likely going to reach a point later on where you'll want gold to buy things. That may be exotics for another character, materials to craft ascended gear, skins for your weapons/armour, or many other things. To give you an idea of some of the costs you may encounter later, ascended gear (best stats, one level above exotic) typically costs you ~50g to craft, per piece. The griffon mount will cost you 250g (in addition to other things). Legendary weapons can cost anywhere from 1000g-3000g to craft. Typically, I try to keep 500g in my bank in reserve for when I need it for something, but I've seen others store thousands. My point is, you shouldn't feel like you need to get rid of/make use of 85g right away, since there's a lot that costs way more than that. 
---
If you do insist on spending it, I'd say use it to level up a crafting discipline, because it'll be useful later (for many things, including getting ascended gear). You'll only need to do it once per discipline, so I think it's a worthwhile investment. For example, when I first started playing, I levelled up my first character as a weaponsmith, and to this day I still use him to craft weapons for all my characters that need them, and have not had to even think about if I have the crafting level required for each item, because he's at the max.
---
same!
---
Because you pay someone to leave a permanent mark on your skin. In this case, geomatrical shapes, which are, apart from circles, straight lines.
---
1) Delete, they are effectively worthless in your situation. 
---
2) Do dungeons, world bosses, gathering routes (see gw2efficiency), sell materials from your bank, pvp reward tracks and the league. Oh, and playing the trading post, which can be done at any level. 
---
Honestly, the fastest way for you is to get level 80 and do the endgame stuff. The game really starts then. Expansions, fractals, raids, HoT and PoF events.
---
That's the thing, all 3 guild halls look like abandoned hovels. They're in disrepair, and no matter how much work the guild invests, **that never changes**.
---
And that's why they are unpleasant to spend time in. One is a wet and damp place full of mold and dark, another are dry and dusty ruins, and the third are... well... dry and dusty ruins.
---
Wow. Such splendor. Much guild hall.
---
There is one on my butt and I haven't seen it for 20 years and it still makes my wife laugh when she sees it. Worth it.
---
No.
---
My only problem with guilds is the fact that in order to unlock it, we need to clear out a whole bunch of enemies, and we are going at it with 2 people
---
You are kind of missing the point here, but then again that is to be expected I guess
---
Let me know what you think and stuff. :)
---
And why should we carry your sorry ass if you can't be bothered to actually play on the level that you yourself require? I normally receive MCs for that.
---
Hahahaha noo just noo
---
[Sky] Represent!
---
For a roaming Shiro/Glint Rev it can be shitty to lose one set of utils for X amount of time, so while a Zerg Rev might not be affected as much it’s definitely _potentially_ a downside for roaming. It’ll depend on how it’s used and what combos. I think the event overall benefits small scale/roaming a lot more than it benefits large scale Zerg v Zerg anyway
---
It is not only the Elixir S all of their cd are gone and they can litterally use it 50000000000000000000 times in row if wanted too. So imagine a group of 5 holo who have infinite cc, infinite invunlerable and infinit rampage/tornade elite and the holo shot on top of that. That IS game breaking.
---
Im currently doing aurora after making vision, and you’re pretty spot on about metas and stuff. Maps like Draconis mons and Bitterfrost have a good amount of players, but certain events and bosses don’t get touched on other maps unless you tag up or ask in map chat periodically. Id say the worst part is that some map mastery achievements require more than just 2-4 players to complete within the achievement parameters. For example I had to run the “lost souls” achievement chain in bloodstone 3 times before I had enough players to complete it before dawn.
---
It’s doable, its just hindered by a lack of players.
---
I really like the face. On some areas of it i would have taken an additional even ligther color for the highlights. In general i think some more highlights and deeper shadows could improve it. A ligth wash on the armor for example brings out some of the details. It looks like you might have done that on the chest piece, but the shoulders for example look still too uniform in my opinion. While the face is fairly detailed you could add some more on other parts of the minature. For example the claws could get a blending of a brownish color to the light bone color on the tips. The sword could get silver dragon theeth and horns. The spikes and the edges of the armor plates could get another metal color. I know the original doesnt have all that, but it would break up the uniform color areas, even if it is just another hue of metal grey or gold, but obviously it would require more time for the minature and not all want to paint every minature in the highest quality they can. Often more simple but faster is enough, especially if you want to finish a lot of minatures, but in a showpiece like that i personally would aim for higher standard everywhere and the face shows you can deliver that.
---
point is that this is just another complaint by a raider about how other players comp their squad and not a psa
---
buT tHe EcOnoMY
---
Necro not having something with a plague doctor aesthetic/theme surprises me tbh.  I'm not sure what sort of weapon could go with that though.
---
That line/shading work is questionable at best. At least it's on your back and you won't have to see it.
---
Ooooh, adding it to the next release :)
---
I'mma repost what I said earlier;
---
&gt;It's not that. OP is complaining about people posting for experienced players and those said players trying to carry someone who's obviously not experienced through the raid. Effectively, LFGing for EXP groups while knowingly harboring inexperienced players in the group is false advertisement.
---
And add this; PuGs aren't there to help you carry a person.  They don't have to tolerate your bullshit and if you're in the minority, there's no reason you should be holding back people from getting a clear they're working towards by harboring someone who can't actually do the content due to a lack of ability.
---
&gt;From what I've read gw2 is not in good condition at the time, maybe it's also only written when things are bad, equally for me that's not a problem, lol is much more popular and yet I'm not encouraged to play it just because it's popular.
---
I don't know where you read this but this is wrong. The game is hugely popular, always has been. If anything I'd call this the golden years. You might've just read a comment from someone who quit the game and assumed everyone else did too or maybe a salty vet who got burned out but either way this just isn't the case at all. I've been playing since beta so I've seen all the ups and downs.  
---
&gt;My fear is that being at the end of the life of this expansion, is still unlocking things from HoT and get another expansion so that I always stay behind, in other mmo simply to do the dungeon of your level and improve the equipment, then raids... But I don't know if here masteries, mounts and other things are more necessary.

There's no gear or stat treadmill so once you have lvl 80 exotics (which are easy to get) you will be able to do 99% of content in the game, the exception is high level fractals. It is going to take a long while to get all the masteries and such and to work through the story but there's no reason to rush it.   
---
The min-maxed gear is only slightly better than exotics so there isn't really a need to have them ASAP. That's the beauty of horizontal progression, lots of cool stuff you can unlock but there's no race to keep up with the joneses. The progression system in GW2 is more about learning more abilities to interact with the world and becoming more skilled at the game and your class rather than arbitrarily becoming better through stats.

Mabye a pistol? Do somthing weird with it like make it a spray weapon or so. I dont know
---
You do but it’s instanced and doesn’t let you enter the JP in open world.
---
Seconded. Came back to the game a couple months ago with 200g in the bank. Currently I'm up to 855g just doing daily and fractals. That's even after spending a couple hundred gold gearing more characters and builds. CMs, t4s, and recs net something like 20-30g. Never felt like I was grinding. Logging in for fractals has been something I look forward to everyday since I came back to the game. Finishing CM100 with no deaths for the "Leaves No Hero Behind" title last night felt great. I haven't done any raids since my first vale gaurdian kill so if I get bored of fractals I have tons of raid content I've never done before. I don't know how much liquid gold you get from raids but it's gotta be similar to fractals right? Anyway, play for fun and the gold will start piling up.

Good job with the fabric around his shoulders, it fits in perfectly naturally!

0:45 Griffon's feet hit the bar and jumped up to the dome. 3/10

This is a.... GEM

Yeah, plus it's the easiest to get, since you could complete all the collections in probably around 3 hours.

Every post like this ends up giving necro a sword, I even made one of these and thought necro should get a sword, but ultimately itd probably be a bad move (with no other changes). Why? Well, swords are 1H, and necro currently has pretty bad OH weapons in terms of PvE. Of the three, WH is probably the best as it has a daze/CC, but the WH5 has been pretty trash in PvE since the change from damage to lifesteal damage (ie. no crit). Focus just recently got "changed", but focus4 does nothing useful in PvE (vuln is already stacked with no problems by even core necro, and lifeforce isnt a real issue in most PvE) and focus5 has long been pointless in PvE. DaggerOH has dag4, which is an ok condi cleanse, but it only does that, meaning it is not useful outside of niche fights, though, in the event a new main hand is condi, dag5 may be worth using a cooldown, potentially.

Oh fuck off, go create your own pug squad and then you'll see what's tolerating bullshit. People like you and OP can only complain and demand. I'm 100% certain than my 100 Li friend in my 250 Li group is doing less harm than people that leave after few seconds due to trivial reason. Nobody is forcing you to be in my squad, you can create ur own - and if you want to then stfu and play the damn game. I don't owe a raid spot to any PuG, if you want to raid in my squad you play by my rules.
---
Friday my be the start of the weekend for some, but many people still work that day.
---
4 day workweeks are not extended.
---
Guild halls will never get an update because they had one goal for anet: drain a shit ton of mats from the game.  That's all they're good for, in Anet's opinion.  Plus, as old content, anet's already moved on to the 200th shiny thing that's caught their attention since.
---
Different body types have different heights.
---
You probably changed the body type without noticing the height change
---
So your argument is that, hypothetically, people might get mad that they didn't get quite as much functionality as they wanted out of secondary professions, and that makes it unworkable?
---
It's very simple. If you want to play dual class with an elite spec, you pick the primary class with that spec. If you want to have two elite specs, you're an idiot, because that's not how they work since day one.
---
After seeing the “wizard” permanent finisher, I’d love to see an elementalist class dual wielding sword + staff unleashing some Gandalf level mayhem.
---
That’s everybody. Last night I was playing with a team of unranked pugs from map chat for fun, and a guy from the other team started flaming us after he won. I don’t know what it is about PvP, but it’s always the most toxic game mode.
---
I guess it’s an unpopular opinion, but I’d be just fine if LS5 didn’t come with any elite specs. I’m hoping for a revamp on underwater combat, though, and maybe a new weapon. Ever since the ogres from Path of Fire had em, I cant stop thinking about greataxes.
---
Please don’t give Anet any ideas. 😂
---
But mad skills bro.
---
Hammer thief. Just because it would be stupid.
---
Imagine going to a car dealership and asking if you should buy a car? And the reason you havent yet is you didnt have the money in the past.
---
If you're interested in playing gw2 and have the time now, just fuckin play it man.
---
hi tobias
---
I don't see anything. You must be crazy
---
they changed it.

[Why did this video got removed for posting an exploit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ca9wm5/garrision_is_enterable_from_homelands_citadel/) when we had a warclaw exploit [on the front page a few days ago]((https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c83nw6/you_can_also_get_inside_bay_outer_innerwall_in/).
---
Wouldn't they have voted? Maybe she was the swing vote, or she picked it and  everyone else agreed. I still think Evon would have had better sense to allow such a silly designer.
---
&gt;  it's about basic human decency
---
basic human decency would be to help fellow players in need, no matter their skill level
---
Necro sword would be cool imo
---
Imagine browsing gw2 subreddit when you dont even play anymore.
---
Do what most people do and just link up with a Zerg in WvW, get them to give you participation and autorun into a wall for a couple hours
---
Completely agree, we have dumped our mats endlessly into decorations and hit the item limit a year ago. Now, whenever something new comes out we have to vote what we will remove in order to put it in. We spent months on complex race tracks and displays in places and they are always at risk because of the limit. We have places in the guild hall that are completely empty. The limit could be 3 times what it is and we still wouldn't have it complete.
---
The issue described by the OP has been around since the “Colin era” of GW2.  In all honesty, I think it’s intentional so that in encourages people to use their credit card.  That being said, the source of the problem is largely to do with how unrefined the crafting system and loot tables are.  The reason why this is a problem is that the end game revolves around these two systems.  
---
In regards to the crafting system, you have to refine hundreds of low level materials to get the materials you actually need to craft the items you want.  When you get to ascended crafting, you’re also dealing with time gates as well as another layer of item refinement.  You’re generally dealing with more than 1000 low level items to craft a single ascended item.  
---
In regards to the loot tables, 99% of the loot you get is vendor trash.  Additionally you never get any useful salvage out of the vendor trash either so it’s actually better to sell the trash.  Fractals and Raids appear to be the only content that will reliably give you loot drops that are not vendor trash but these are generally considered the exception to the rule.  Last but not least, because the loot tables never give you the crafting mats you need, it puts more pressure on the already flawed crafting system.  
---
This is largely the reason why earning gold is so important.  It is the most reliable way to progress in GW2.  Rather than craft the items you need or get them as loot drops, it’s easier (and generally cheaper) to buy them with gold on the Trading Post.  If the crafting system and loot tables “pulled their weight”, gold farming would be less important in GW2.
---
Yikes
---
Yeah, that's what happens when you layoff the entire QA department...
---
I would say sure but at the same time I don't think that changes the point I was going for, that no other class can do this thus is the most powerful in this context. I do agree entirely this doesn't really impact zerg scale and is far more impacftul on roaming scale.
---
Did you miss the part where I like to argue? lol  Sorry, it's in my blood. I'm not angry or even a little annoyed. I was entertaining myself. I've been trolling trolls for years now.  There's very little that happens on forums that bothers me. I have real life stuff enough to bother me. I come here to blow off steam.
---
So now following her is no longer considered stalking.. nice!
---
EotM is still wvw and all though less populated will still get a rp-er roflstomped.
---
Fuck hammers, give me rifles. I need my HMS Divinity.
---
same back at ya.
---
Guild Wars 2 is probably the best MMO for you full stop, because it doesn't raise the level cap and it doesn't introduce new tiers of gear. Even something like mounts and gliding, they may take a while, but they're account bound, so once you have them you have them on new characters as well.
---
Furthermore, you need neither a griffon nor a skyscale, the only mounts that take a longer time to get, to play the game. You can play the game with the four mounts you can get easily by playing through the POF story. 
---
In this game gear doesn't really keep you from much content and it keeps you from almost no casual content. I have a bunch of characters (as in over 40) and most of them are in exotics and they do just fine in pretty much every area I want to go in. Basically in this game, the harder something is to get, or the longer it takes, the less it's actually needed.
---
Just try to log in every day to collect your laurels and other log in rewards, even if you can't actively play because those will help you along in catching up a bit.  But yeah, I have people that have taken 4 year breaks from the game, come back to the guild and they jump right in and do the same stuff the rest of us are doing.
---
It's cute that you think they had a QA department.
---
how do
---
Dual pistol demon hunter necro.
---
Longbow elemental archer elementalist
---
&gt; this build can be used for mobility with skills like Bladestorm
---
Bladestorm for mobility? O_o
---
Jawgoues is prob so mad right now! A tattoo gets 1000 upvotes Hahahahahah
---
It's unclear how they decided, or how split the view was.
---
But Kiel's showed to be more realistic than the other captains. So I'd blame the rest, not Kiel, personally. They're the dumbasses who said Scarlet wouldn't attack the same place (LA) twice.
---
Well, that sounds like an exploit if I ever heard one...
---
The power creep isn’t as high as you’re claiming; you forget Alacrity used to be 66% and 33%, GOTL used to give dps % dmg buffs, boons were able to be given 10 man by 1 Chrono. The overall damage differential between start of HoT and now isn’t super crazy high; more people are also better at the game now, there are better resources for how to do things, things like DPS meters and DPS golem exist now, better strategies have evolved through time, etc. Most of this doesn’t really fall under the definition of “power creep” and what I’ve listed above is the biggest factor for why things are easier than they used to be as opposed to just flat numbers and damage being significantly higher than HoT launch

&gt;go create your own pug squad and then you'll see what's tolerating bullshit.
---
&gt;Nobody is forcing you to be in my squad, you can create ur own - and if you want to then stfu and play the damn game.
---
I usually do, and most days, it goes fine when people actually carry their weight instead of expecting to be carried.
---
&gt;People like you and OP can only complain and demand.
---
If the group expects a certain amount of LI or KPs, it inherently expects a certain level of performance and experience with the fight.
---
&gt;I'm 100% certain that my 100 Li friend in my 250 Li group is doing less harm than people that leave after few seconds due to trivial reasons.
---
Is it really trivial if your 100 LI friend is consistently screwing up a mechanic and causing full party wipes?  That's what the OP is complaining about.
---
&gt;I don't owe a raid spot to any PuG, if you want to raid in my squad you play by my rules.
---
And any skilled player doesn't owe you their performance to carry someone who's obviously under-performing.
---
You mean like that time there was a living world episode that broke the entire game for almost a full day and the episode instances themselves weren't working?
---
Bugs happen in games. It's the weekend. Biggest mistake here is trying to line up the bonus events with the regular weekly reset (which is intentionally timed for the weekend) because it makes bugs take longer to respond to until they are all back in the office on Monday.
---
Balance is mostly subjective and will never be 100% fixed. There will always be complaints on the forums about this even if balance was “the fairest possible”
---
I just want more hairs and faces that aren't Elonian or Olamakan.
