It's not the first rare collectable they've randomly made obtainable for a few silver. Remember the Mini Karma that once was worth several thousand gold and thus became THE status symbol? I just wish they were consequent and released Mini Sparcles for a handful of Laurels..

---
---
can confirm. had a small bounty train going all evening and the lag was... not quite wvw bad, but bad nonetheless... in a 10 man squad. no huge blobs in sight. at one point several of us got even kicked out of the game. and yes, the entire squad was experiencing these spikes across all crystal desert maps (EU).

He's been on and off streaming his Master's series on his second channel, along with some off-stream pvping (that I end up queing against)
---
As a Berserker you‚Äôll have more luck getting into raids and high tier fractals, but personally I love the animations and skills that Holosmith has. Plus for dungeons and low tier fractals (1-50) anything goes so why not have both, one for casual, and one for challenging.
---
I love these for Science experiments üòÅüëç
---
If you don't care too much about raiding or high level fractals the necro is probably the best choice. There's a core minion build on metabattle, but you probably want to work towards reaper while using that.
---
Are you thinking of Mighty Teapot?
---
&gt; They are worthless because they are simply useless.
---

---
Best argument ever. lmao
---
&gt; I'm using lootbox as a container that intentionally mis-represents the drop rates of its valuable items.
---
So you make your own definition for the word "Lootbox", aha.
---
I used to spend a lot of time doing raid training in a guild, and there are basically two prerequisites that actually matter:
---
1. Have the right stats
---
2. Have a basic idea of what your rotation should be
---
You don't have to have perfect min/maxed ascended gear with a perfectly optimized crit cap for your class, and you don't have to be incredible at your rotation. However, you should be running glass cannon stats as a dps (generally Berserker or Viper, exotic is fine), and you should be doing more than mashing 1 to dps the boss. The rest will come with time including the mechanics which are mainly on the training commander to explain (or they may direct you to a video).
---
However, I cannot understate the importance of the first point which is the issue you may have run into. Running the wrong stats has an *enormously negative* impact on your dps. It's to the point where you're *significantly better off* running exotic gear of the correct stats than ascended gear of the wrong stats. Additionally, if you're running unexpected toughness (such as with Soldier's gear), then it's possible to fundamentally screw over the entire raid by taking boss aggro away from the tank.
---
You didn't say what stats you were running so it's possible the guy was crazy. However, it is also possible that he was justified depending on what gear you were using. (For what it's worth, you generally want to run the same gear in fractals as you do in raids.)
---
1st place was probably banned and removed from the list. I guess they don't have a script in place that pushes people up a rank if someone is removed.
---
No WP is playing wow Classic for a gw1 wow comparisson Video 
---
But He in no way quit the Game hes pvping every evening and streaming the Masters series in the mornings
---
&gt; Rip 200g.
---
There is no possible scenario where you get it unlocked *and* get 200g for it. That's not how it works.
---
The classic classic WoW not this classic Wow but the old Classic WoW
---
Also, the supply of infusions never really goes down, since they don't account bind and can be resold at will.
---
It may sound complicated, but in practice you just keep playing and consuming all luck you get.
---
If they made the luck usable for other things, like crafting boosters, then you'll have to constantly gather the essences and craft stuff with them.
---
Oh, I am sorry! Do I not conform to your tastes on my own character?
---
How about you tell me how my thief should look like and I get right into not changing her looks.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve opened 12 stacks of the things and got a 4 minis which sold for less than 10silver. And literally got nothing else except the common stuff. Last year I only opened up for maybe four or five stacks and got some nice stuff. I don‚Äôt know if my luck is really just that bad this year or they have severely nerfed the drop rates.
---
I thought the more karma you had the more casual trash you were :O
---
[removed]
---
But what if they think that characters should look more fantastical and shiny rather than simple and normal? In that case the "what's wrong with you" would be more of an insult since it would mean they are calling me abnormal.
---
Do you really want to go into an argument about that though? I perceived it that way.
---
r/woosh
---
Ive given that idea plenty of thought. And I know the gw2 forum+reddit community quite well. My conclusions are very solid, even if you dont like them.
---
Its not as if a token system would decrease the amount of effort you'd need to get a unique item. Otherwise its not a unique item anymore.
---
A tokensystem however takes away the hope-factor of RNG based systems.
---
Ofc people would whine. Ofc anet would fold. Ofc we would end up with even less unique rewards, even more dissatisfied "overfed" players. Theres been not a single incident over the last 4 years that would have shown otherwise, while since PoF the incidents confirming my opinion are quite plentiful - skyclaw "grind", halloween beetle outrage to name two prominent ones. Both show a sever lack of patience and commitment by quite a big part of gw2 playerbase.
---
Also, theres already a "token" system in place. Its called gold.
---
That is why gw2 sucks . The game doesnt feel rewarding at all .

---
As I said, more luck as a Berserker (the elite HoT spec for Warrior) but personally I like Holosmith a lot better. I never said Holo was more ‚Äúmeta‚Äù than Berserker.
---
Don‚Äôt eat for a day. Ez.
---
Don't bother thinking about numbers and play whatever you feel like playing, they both are perfectly viable classes for most pve content capable of (eles, mirages aside) topping the charts on both power and condi encounters, while warrior (BS) is a must have for every raid group, holosmith was a must have dps until a couple of patches ago and is just a small thief poison nerf away from coming back to the top, everything can change at any given moment it all comes down to anet's delusions.  
---
**Answering your question** ATM Warrior pulls (slightly) better numbers on most scenarios, has a better burst, CC and utility.  So I'd stick with it, then again and let me repeat myself. Everything may (will) change at any given moment.
---
Quick question, how am I too hostile now?
---
Dude, it was clear to the whole world except Trump maybe, that this was a joke. Calmeth thy tattas.
---
I have to get my Magic find to about 620 to get a decent drop rate.
---
&gt; The "problem" with Berserker is that you'll almost certainly be asked to take banners at one point or another.
---
If you aren't playing raids, Banners aren't that big of a deal.
---
It costs about that much in cobs, not that they would've sold it for that much.
---
Awesome! Thank you very much! :) cos of that "condi" and "later" im planning to make legendary armor. So i can switch on the go. But im glad that power quickbrand will work at least for fun and metas etc. :)
---
I don't know about lifetime but on the daily, I see random people.
---
Not really though, because he never played at vanilla, so he's going by classic WoW since that's the only playable option. 
---
So it's the original classic WoW, not the classic original WoW.   /s
---
Blast from the past. I wonder what happened to them
---
Does anyone actually care?
---
Power Berserker is fun and meta in fractals. Banner changes makes 100% uptime possible now, provided you‚Äôre vigilant in timing the cool down. 
---
For fractals without the need for CC (eg. Solid Ocean), rifle works well (make sure to get the trait to reduce rifle skill cd). I can get top dps killing tentacles with rifle. 
---
Actually no, go play holo. Don‚Äôt take up my Warrior slot in Fractal! ;p
---
Probably not but I thought it was funny
---
"Master's series"...aka: please give me free stuff so I can try to 100% my account, under the guise of a "community goal".
---
Join a different squad. I don't know what else to tell you. People have their own pace. Some are slow, some are fast, some go clockwise, some counterclockwise. Some open all doors, some skip bosses and vets. Go to LFG, look for a squad you think suits your needs and if their route or speed isn't to your taste, try another. Once you find a good squad, add the commander to your friends list so you know when they're running. At least that's what I did. They wont adjust to you.
---
"and 25% speed" you should have perma swiftness... I assume you didn't use the Superspeed in combination with a toy. 
---
Well since you didn't give much context I guess the commander is right. Use a mount or learn to utilize your skill correctly.
---
Well I'm not sure you even watch his last video because it was MO who left not Z who is still game director of Guild War 2.
---
p much everything is too slow except Daredevil bc com is always a Daredevil this year. using a mount is not cool though that's a bad comm
---
Did the commander hack? If no then you are wrong.
---
1. That Mightyteapot and hell he hasn't even quit the game as he was literally just live streaming GW2 yesterday.
---
2. Yes WP has played WoW classic but has in no way said he has quit GW2.
---
3. Only GW2 creator who has actually quit is some guy called Jawgeous and no offence meant I doubt his streams were that big in the first place.
---
A balance patch hit in the middle of this series. I guess he must reevaluate his builds now.
---
[Meta fractal builds](https://discretize.eu/builds), they have different pros and cons but for pure DPS weaver or DH.Raids is a little more tricky because the[ highest power benchmark](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) is rifle deadeye which works extremely well on some fights (like MO) and is much harder on others  where you need more mobility. Besides that chrono, weaver, DH, DD (which gets a massive buff depending on the steal), power berserker, etc. Lots of great choices that all have pros and cons of area damage, burst, hitbox size, group buffs.
---
hmm,it could be to prevent bots to farm this.
---
I highly recommend mirage with greatsword. Using blink, signet of inspiration and jaunt, you have a lot lot of mobility. GS has insane range and makes it easy to tag. Slot sigil of stamina in it and so press dodge as u run around.
---
I do not think they are around anymore.  Relevant to Halloween...
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1NywhF1HSQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1NywhF1HSQ)
---
idk I'm in tier 1
---
Ty man
---
Oh you know what that might be it
---
Berserker for that raw damage, amplified by its easy rotations. I use a holo but that was back when berserkers where simple banner slaves, but that changed a few months ago or something. It does damage, but **only** damage, and nothing really beyond that. You will find yourself in more trouble for harder content sometimes if it cant simply be blown away.
---
Holo is less raw damage and harder rotations, but can do more than simply pure damage. I find myself soloing open world content way easier with it than berserker since it brings more utility to the table. Aside from content you outright can't fight solo you will rarely go down with holo. It has added bonus of being a great pvp (for now) and fractal class. Berserker is too, but it needs more support.
---
All in all the berserker gets more raw damage and needs some support but the holosmith is a self-contained package if that makes sense.
---
Right. They don't care about the individual ability to pull an item, as the item will almost definitely enter the TP, and they know roughly where they want it to sit there. So they look at how many bags are all across the game, and calibrate the drop rate to their targeted rarity for the TP, not an individual player.
---
Anyone know if there is a gw2 TacO route for the halloween beetle race? I didn't see one in Tekkit's workshop packs, and can't seem to find anything else.
---
Just usual chat reports, nothing to see here
---
These comments, wow. *No one*, not even the comm, should be using a mount. Anyone who doesn't have a issue with that is flat out stupid. OP, hes a idiot and so are the comments you're receiving. Just switch to another squad and move on from the idiot.
---
Does anyone know of a good (written) guide for Gw2 that's geared towards someone completely new to MMORPGs?
---
My wife and I just started playing but the only gaming experience she has is Planetside 2.
---
Even simple concepts like equipping a new better weapon are foreign to her. She just figured "I'm already using a longbow, why do I need another one?"
---
Maybe even just a general MMORPG guide would be helpful.
---
Also, I purchased the expansions set 2 days ago that comes with 4k gems, but I still haven't received them. Is this normal, or should I contact support?
---
guess people going to leather farm again
---
Always on Fire Day and night

IIRC the 1000 chest weapon is only once per account.

Those sound like fun groups. I remember doing dungeons where we ended up having an incredibly successful, and fun time after the min-max hardcore dude ragequit after things not going perfectly.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Course, part of my fear is the fact I do like getting achievements and stuff. When I've expressed similar desires in Fractal groups, it always gets shot down with various levels of anger or disgust.
---
This comment is a bit too preachy which is probably why someone downvoted it. Nevertheless, I agree with the spirit of the comment. 
---
Using the time spent leveling to 80 to learn the ins and outs of your class will obviously give you far better understanding of your capabilities and open your mind to even more possibilities. 
---
Looking for meta builds is fine. It's only natural to search for a guideline, that in itself is a sign of a good mentality for self improvement. Self introspection also is a valuable skill for recognizing how a build performs in practice and having a solid knowledge of your own class is a strong foundation for gitting gud.
---
&gt;  so I had to say something
---
You really didn't. If things were as bad as you say, this farm was going to die anyway. And if not, then this was simply not the right commander for you. Whispering him wasn't going to change a thing.
---
Dammit Steve, not again!
---
After reading this reddit I just want to point out for op that the holo dmg is good as well. I have played 90% power holo in fracs (cm&amp;t4) and raids pugs in the last couple of months and I'm mostly first in dps except when every once in a while (about twice a month in either category) someone tops me - then I am second.
---
This includes KC and even Matthias (if I am too lazy to change).
---
Ofc this doesn't mean that you will always be the top dps. I just want you not to be discouraged. 
---
So it just comes down on how good you can handle your rotation. This Ofc includes that if others know their rotation as well as you, then it comes down to benchmarks and the respective rotation downsides (deadeye can barely move, weaver has lots of aa chain that shouldn't be broken, holo can't disable photon forge while jumping and it might overheat,...).
---
I don't think controls are needed for any tradeable items. I \*would\* like some form of control and/or not ridiculous drop rate for things which are account bount: Teq weapon boxes, or the aurene-choice boxes in dragon fall for example. (Or like how music boxes used to be).
---
Having account-bound items in the "super rare" category is really frustrating, because even if I opened 100k of something I won't get them.
---
I'm also somewhat annoyed by the rarity of the charr headgear from the saga prologue, but at least in theory you can purchase that. (Granted, so far the drop rate is really low and not enough chests get open to make up for that...)
---
Hopefully you have auto loot, but otherwise a short bow on a thief seems to be best with a swiftness sigil on it. You want to move fast and try to maintain perma swiftness if possible.
---
Nah, everything is possible [https://i.imgur.com/onEh0MR.png](https://i.imgur.com/onEh0MR.png)
---
For Zerg tagging in the Lab I use my DH with a longbow and Pure of Voice with Retreat and Pack runes.  
---
Nearly 100% personal swiftness uptime if I need it  
---
I use Wings of Resolve as a gap closer to catch up to the front of the zerg  
---
Longbow has 1200 range, the attack bounces  
---
Because DH lonbow, you're not in danger of killing stuff too fast lolol  
---
Plenty of AoE with traps and symbols  
---
Worked better for me than Flamethrower engi because I was able to keep up with the head of the zerg and had the range to catch mobs all those soulbeasts were trying to 1 shot at 1500.
---
I like tittle :)
---
yes you are actually right. He maybe had good intentions but went into rabbit hole and is now lost for the community. As he is playing other game then the rest of us , people who dont have army of donation giving drones.
---
This question was asked a million times by our community before the game even launched.
---
I completed the skimmer race in Grothmar at exactly 1.00.000. I got gold but it did NOT give me the achievement... suppose it's really strict with the "UNDER the time limit".
---
Of course, then I realized there was a shiny new special action just for that race and easily beat it the next time. :P
---
At the moment you only need to buy Path of Fire, as the previous expansion is already bundled with it :) And that's it :)
---
But first I would suggest trying the free2play mode and see if this type of gameplay suits you.
---
Yes he has shared his view he is more upset about the fact that PvP templates aren't coming in. He points out he has said Anet should sell extra build slots on the gem store and for this he isn't as mad as most of the community. These are just 2 points I understand but I'm sure you can go watch his streams since the build templates announcement to see his opinion.
---
Zhaitan is also a dragon from water, and his minions often wash up on shores. Lyssa could have Zhaitan, and then Grenth could have Jormag for frost.
---
What are you on about nothing in this post asks about donations to Woodenpotatoes or his challenge he is trying to complete the question was what is his views on build templates are.
---
Oh I also want to collect all these minis. I'm in halfway, so it will be a long journey. Congrats for your collection :)
---
Dont buy exotics or rares from the trading post, for leveling, you will get what you need from quests, and they are way too expensive compared to what you get.
---
if you can, get some halloween exp food to help with your journey.
---
take time to enjoy the festivities and the events, they are a lot of fun even if you are not max level.
---
Its the maps, they are unsually hugh for the engine.
---
got it on 3rd try... its not so hard. i still hate bettle tho.
---
I struggled super hard getting even within 10 seconds of the time for gold, then one run just went really really well and I ended up 6 seconds under. Just gotta keep at it :)
---
This is the dumbest shit i seen in a while
---
If you need any pointers, I made a video of a non tryhard attempt [https://youtu.be/UShM7Jwln7w](here) which does it in 47 seconds
---
I think noone was realistically expecting 100k bags (worth 5 silver ish) for 5000 gold to drop items worth a lot more than that together with the other junk worth serveral 100/1000 gold right? If that were the case on average the items would be a lot less expensive
---
Both of expansions you get when you buy PoF, people already told you that. When buying this you will get a question if you want to add the seasons and here is were you need to think. There are 3 playable seasons today. Season 2, 3 and 4. Seasons are what we get between expansions and they continue on the story that started with your personal story. 
---
Season two till give you the story, ascended back pack, access to sinister recipe and ascended jewelry at the npc in Silver Waste when you finished all the achivements. Achivements also give you mastery points which is good to get for your tyria masteries.
---
Season 3 will give you continue of the story from HoT expac and new maps, new currency that you will need for several collections such as legendary trinkets and mastery points towards HoT masteries. 
---
Season 4 continue were the PoF story finished and you get the story, new maps, new currency, new mounts (mounts are not just skins in this game they all have a purpose), Mastery points towards PoF.
---
Season 5 did just start and have been changed to be a saga. If you log on today you will store the first prelouge and don't have to buy that. If you log in every time there is a new chapter up you wont have to pay for that either. This is how it worked in the past. Chapters/seasons are free if you play during the time they are up. 
---
So imo if you want to play all the game were some of the season maps are very valid to farm and good to have i would advice you to get those too. If money is a issue then you can farm gold in the game and exchange to gems and buy them that way. It is a bit of a farm i am not going to lie but just making sure you understand that it is possible to buy it that way too.
---
Perma swiftness and the limited superspeed you get as an ele just aren't enough to keep up with a tryhard thief. It is not a l2p issue, it is simply not possible. Not even if you throw Lightning Flash in and use weapon mobility skills.
---
You wonder how many states of undress they can come up with.

I can‚Äôt for the love of me get it under 1.05.00. Drifting is just not my forte

Zuzu still can't go into the forge :/

Wait wait wait... So you're telling me that Lyssa is Aqua?
---
Funny thing with drop rate posts like this one, you'd think they'd make the price of bags drop ... but they never do. 7 years, many festivals, many types of bags "researched", and tp prices of rng bags never move much.
---
chat
---
The less exclusivity there is the less people want it.
---
If you could get a Santa suit from super hard content, it would be expensive af.
---
If you could get an amazing looking set straight out of high fantasy from a vendor for free, no one would want it.
---
You really should l2p if you are serious in this comment then lol.
---
If you are at all interested in the additional seasonal story packs mentioned in the comment from /u/Lovaa, I would recommend buying the ultimate edition of the game. This gives you both expansions, $50 worth of gems, and some freebies of varying usefulness.
---
I would normally recommend waiting for sales before buying most gemstore items, but I believe the stories were just on sale and don't know when they will next be discounted.  If nothing else, play through the base game story to start with and decide if it's something you are interested in and a sale may pop up in the meantime.
---
you can ask on his own reddit, not here
---
&gt; I gave that example to illustrate how not everyone can afford to put 30 dollars in a game
---
And I explained how someone in that situation would be irresponsible for sinking money in a game that has so much content free of charge. 
---
&gt; All I did was ask if there was going to be another discount in the  future and you got ticked for some reason. Again, be a bit more  empathetic. 
---
Yeah, I'm empathetic, for the rest of their family, while they spend money on a game that doesn't require you to spend money to enjoy a huge part of the content.
---
I don't know what's worse, the joke or that build.
---
Get a shortbow (SB skill 5 for mobility) and get yourself into Mad King's Labyrinth. Use LFG to find a group. You will be leveling up quickly and you'll earn gold along the way.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
There is no other diferrenc between them and the other Maps beside Size. When this effects are new check ur PC. They changed nothing on the maps in the last Year.
---
Yeah it would, at least to a certain degree. Once you're handling huge amounts of currencies/gold you very quickly get desensitized of  the value ingame content holds for you.
---
The entire thing about zerk/condi builds is that they're glass cannons. You *are* supposed to feel squishy, and kill an enemy before they take advantage of your squishiness *or* rely on a support. The only think that makes you feel weaker with s/s is because you aren't dedicated solely to power, and bow gets an advantage of bigger range (thus you can more easily withdraw without loosing too much of dps). At this point, I'd consider going for condi build tho. It's more fun anyway and in longer fights it performs really well.
---
Damn so close!! Better luck next time!
---
I'm not talking about hardware lag, mate.
---
I think your distaste towards him also alters your perception of things. WP never really shared the opinions of reddits majority. Latching on him for this particular case and in such a way is silly imo. 
---
Also ingame gemstore donations: hate the game not the player. Would you be more proud of him if he grinded the gemstore? Partner ship is an exclusivity but cmon that's fair.
---
No, you can unlock it even if you are f2p. But to play Icebrood Saga, you must buy pof
---
The node from the last LW episode has both a vendor option and a loot option. Guess which one is waaay cheaper.
---
Everything, except 3 previous LW seasons, which are half of the expansion content.
---
I stopped caring about rewards altogether very long ago, and I think a lot of people did too.
---
The problem with that attitude is that the only thing left in the game is the gameplay itself, which has been stale and lackluster for years. No wonders more and more people are just leaving altogether, or just logging for the daily.
---
Well obviously his name is "Lord"
---
&gt; Dropchances in an MMO must be that low to give an item a reasonable value.
---
Or, you know, they could be based on skill instead?
---
WoW has color variations for each mount, and each one is usually tied to one game mode or way of playing the game. Then there's an ultimate mount skin when you collect all the other ones.
---
You still kill less enemies in GW2 than in other games, so I wouldn't say that's the reason.
---

Don't thank me, thank Tolkyria for their excellent work! It looks like there's already a filterable list of runes on the article already, again thanks to Tolkyria: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_Build#Runes

Be grateful for what? He does these streams for himself and his own profits.
---
Tempest is very good! Dagger/warhorn/overload tags everything in air mode. Commander in your chat is stupid.

Mount = Bad, too much damage, too fast, never use
---
Damage = Bad, it steals loot, everyone should be naked or full nomad/minstrel
---
I don‚Äôt think that was their point.  The point is when getting a normal blue item drop, if you have 900 as a base MF before adding boosters (as an example) you will get very few blue drops if any.
---
The downward pressure on rares/exotics would be pretty intense if they raised the base Account MF cap significantly.
---
kitten kitten kitten :P
---
He shared some comments on his stream but not much. He just said that he is unsure about their direction with sagas mostly,including agressive monetization of templates and why they are delayed for PvP. But he is indeed in an awkward position. WP has large gold and gem donations and is probably the biggest partner atm. However agressive the monetization is it won't affect him personally.
---
Idk to what extend he used arc templates, if used them at all but for everyone who used it extensively the opinion is the same. We lost free unlimited slots (arc) to get limited bought slots. Basically the total opposite...
---
I‚Äôm MF capped, have 5m luck stores since last Lunar New Year and during LNY donated ~40m luck to drooburt.
---
That totals to nearly 50m luck.  If anet set the bar that high there wouldn‚Äôt be many players at all who would hit the cap.
---
And I‚Äôm not even *that* rich.
---
Get the game itself, you receive the base game and both expansions. You'll have to buy the season content in addition, though, either via actual money or by farming and converting (an ton of) ingame gold.
---
The order goes like this:
---
* Personal story/base game
---
* [Season 1, The Movie; Enhanced Edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg)
---
* Season 2
---
* HoT
---
* Season 3
---
* PoF
---
* Season 4
---
* Season 5 / Icebrood Saga (It's going to start in a week or two or something.)
---
1. Create vanilla WoW private server
---
2. ???
---
3. Profit
---
Is that site updated with the recent TP-Prices? If so, amazing work.
---
Probably because the vast majority of GW2 players aren't Reddit users, so they never see these stats.

If path of fire is added to your account, you get heart of thorns automatically. No matter how.

Alright, I‚Äôll try doing it with less drifting then. Thanks!

It‚Äôs actually quite alive. That you are on this subreddit commenting means you are still playing, right?...
---
DPS does damage and some CC!
---
Healer heals and removes conditions from DPS so they can do more damage. Tanks moves the boss so DPS can do more damage. Chrono/renegade/quickbrand gives buffs and CC so DPS can do more damage.
---
Everyone does mechanics.
---
Simple as that! So far it has worked just fine many years, so there is no need to change anything. I choose to be pure DPS, because it is the easiest to play.
---
&gt; DPS does damage and some CC!
---
Axe mirage has virtually none, as an example.
---
&gt;Healer heals and removes conditions from DPS so they can do more damage. Tanks moves the boss so DPS can do more damage. Chrono/renegade/quickbrand gives buffs and CC so DPS can do more damage.
---
Except OP does all them things. DPS don't have as many mechanics to deal with as other roles.
---
&gt;I choose to be pure DPS, because it is the easiest to play.
---
Yes because it has to do less mechanics but OP did not choose the easy route, he choose to be diverse and he shouldn't be restricted from doing that.
---
Probably the same as usual. He sees the issue, but isn't as short-sighted black-and-white about it, doesn't share this sub's hysteria and screeching negativity and follows generally a more level-headed, sane direction of thought.
---
Like others said, only pof is needed. Btw don't use the lvl 80 boost.

Creating your own private server isn't the same experience as playing on live, we're talking about an online game vs online game comparison review.
---
Are there still regularly tours being done of HoT and PoF? Europe.
---
I remember there were almost daily hp trains going on, and almost every weekend someone would lead an eight hour train completing all the maps, metas and most achievements for the given expansion.
---
I came back after over a year and started a new character, in dire need of a HoT completion :X
---
How do you slide only so little even after full acceleration? I press my slide and slide three times across the planet
---
Lag, not FPS loss
---
Yep, happened to me as well. https://i.imgur.com/rgkKGqa.png 
---
Needless to say I was both annoyed and surprised.
---
I switched to Raptor on the last turn. It shaved off those few milliseconds I needed.
---
It's probably taro or ube.
---
Amen
---
sure, but we have zero context to the bad pun. So it's just there...
---
yes there are 2 moments when tower explodes and I lag everytime it happens. First is near the start , second near long free fall. For some reason this exploding thing give some people including me a second lag.
---
Okay, that does make some sense. Carrion is a bit too weak in a lot of areas. It's the best of the worst, but I can still see why people would get upset. Also, grinding out exotic vipers isn't worth the gold/mats. all you need is the exotic insignia and you can stat-swap it. And Black Diamonds drop like candy.
---
Different race, though.
---
People in WoW are fine with 1% drop rate for mounts from boases that you can kill once per week. 0,0x% wouldn't be bad for a super rare drop too. Meanwhile, from what we can see super rare drop has more or less 0,001% chance to drop, which is hilarious, especially when there is no bad luck protection in GW2.
---
That shouldn't happen. I've never seen random people on my list on any race or adventure, ever.
---
The fact that he's headless as a ghost is a reference to the upcoming tyrian revolution.
---
Been on BG since beta, HOD and ET were the titans of wvw and BG was just this cute little boy from tier 3. I've seen great guilds come and go. Server pride!
---
I agree. So don't buy it. It'll help ANet focus their efforts. The company has been pretty good about producing a quality game that is NOT b2p/ p2w. None of what you mentioned I'd necessary to play and enjoy. 
---
What I object to is the characterisation of ANet as greedy. FFS, they stand out as decidely user centric in game design. I don't like what happened with build templates either, but they have to make money somewhere and that doesn't make them greedy, it makes them a business.
---
Just going to throw this out there for people reading the rest of the thread. Many people are using the term "political" or "politics" when referencing current events swirling around gaming and sporting and China. The root cause here is anything but political - it's a HUMAN RIGHTS issue.  Blizzard and the NBA (leaders AND players)  give the appearance of not supporting human rights when they silence players on this subject.
---
Jezus, did the dollar drop that much in value? That you'd need $1000 for a skin?
---
We live in a society.
---
hahaha i love it
---
Thank you all for the help! In fact, i was talking about DLGamer in the post so yes that's exactaly where I am going to buy the expansion
---
I can agree with that.
---
"Give me those skritt unlocks, its free"
---
Sure, but you need power banners (e.g. gorse, samarog, KC) for a lot of fights and condi banners for others (e.g. dhuum, SH, Sabetha).
---
"Banner Slave" is secretly two builds
---
I did that. It asks me there too. I ended up creating a support ticket and hopefully I can get these issues solved.
---
I haven't kept up on the streams, but my impression was he wasn't so much "upset" as he just wished that the PvP templates were in but he also realizes he's a tiny minority.
---
I used to listen to them when I was newer and less jaded, but after about a year I realized that he was more in touch with the lore than much of ArenaNet was.  Listening to WP gush on about what, "could have been," got emotionally exhausting.  His discussions are exciting in the moment up until an episode releases and ArenaNet nails the overview and minces the details which are generally the most exciting parts of WP's discussion &amp; analysis.
---
it depends on the situation but that's mostly my strategy yes, making sure I don't hold the drift key to long. Some other strategy people are using is to simply not hold forward(W) while doing the drift and after you've gone through the corner as you like it, press forward then to get a more controlled exit out of the drift going straight forward from there.
---
It very much is a practice makes perfect thing though. Took me a while when this race first came out years ago to get the feel making drift corners right, but keep at it, it'll click for you eventually!
---
General advice: don't sell anything to a NPC vendor unless it is specifically called "junk item" in the description. If you drop gear and weapons, always check it's worth on the Black Lion Trading Post. It's the "auction house" of the game where you can buy and sell stuff from and to players. Some items are worth a lot and you don't wanna miss out that money by selling it to an NPC that gives you basically nothing in return. 
---
Also: use salvage kits. If you drop weapons or gear that are worth nothing, use a salvage kit on them. Keep the materials, you can store them in your material bank (you can store 250 of EACH material in the entire game in there). The material bank is an own entity so you will not loose any space by storing stuff in there. You will still have your regular bank where you can put in items that you want to keep, like some weapons for example. You can use the Basic Salvage Kit (bought by any standart NPC vendor in almost every map) for Basic, Fine and Masterwork gear. You can also salvage Rare below lvl 80 gear with this. Lvl 80 rare gear should be salvaged with a better Salvage Kit. As for exotic gear, keep it or sell it on the Trading Post. The salvage kit for exotic gear is a little bit more difficult to get but don't worry about that now. 
---
Materials from low lvl weapons and gear are FAR more worth then the stuff you get once you hit lvl 80, so keep that in mind and gather all the materials you can get. You will 100% need them later!
---
Consider toning down your settings for skill effects, then?  The jump and spin is his quickest attack move beyond his (weak) auto-attack, but there's still enough time to dodge it on reaction.

Just posted on the old thread, before this one came up, so a repeat question:
---
Came back to the game and played through Heart of Thorns. Thinking of boosting second character to change it up a bit from warrior.
---
If I use the lv80 boost on a second character, do I need to start HoT completely from scratch? Replay all the story content to unlock the maps?
---
Welcome to GW!! Hope you enjoy it as much as I have over these last 7 years.

Jackal here + teleport + Bond of Faith to yeet myself to the 57s mark.
---
Got my time to :57 but I need to shave off a few more seconds to beat the rest of my guildes.
---
thank you very much for the visage, had to do it immediately :D
---
I thought everyone already knew that since adventures were added to the game.
---
As a non Raider, I find myself redoing the strike mission quite a bit. Not because of the sub par rewards, but because it's just straight up fun. It does feel a bit too easy though.
---
Semi-seriously: where'd "Steve" come from?
---
If you're anything like me I have avoided adventures like the plague.
---
I usually avoid the red glowing wall like the plague.
---
&gt; It's not like there are any gold sinks in the game
---
What about legendaries, BLC weapon skins, Nightfure, Winter's Presence, weapon skins collections, MF weapons, crafting ascended on your alts, convenience unlocks (gem store), etc.
---
There's way too many things to buy with gold that I would rather buy useful things than "shiny" infusions that doesn't really do anything.
---
U need to be under 1 min.

---
Yes, casuals will be screwed as usual, but that‚Äôs no different from real life. Unless you‚Äôre wealthy or a master of a particular craft due to time investment and skill, you‚Äôll be stuck grinding 7-4.
---
I‚Äôm not saying this is how it should be, I‚Äô m explaining how the game is designed.
---
I don't think you can handle it.
---
Buy the PoF expansion, it includes the HoT expansion as well, while your at it buy seasons 2,3,4 living story packs if u can afford them. Play a class you enjoy, go thru the story of the core game, then go thru living world season 2, then HoT story, then lws3, then PoF story, then lws4, while your at it do map completions. And lastly do not use your level 80 boost, you will regret it. Enjoy the game at your own pace and try to learn the game mechanics. Save your 80 booster for your future alt characters.
---
Then you're REALLY bad at making a point. Don't be passive aggressive.
---
Wtf I got the exact same time and reaction yesterday
---
I would wager she would grow with age. But who knows how these fuckers work lol.
---
Uh? Aqua? Dunno what you're talking about but, yes, Lyssa is the goddess of water ever since Kormir gave up that title.
---
I don't think there is no bad luck protection for SoS bags (depends on how youd efine it). 
---
Even if you get nothing rare, you always get tons of Candy Corn, Chattering Skulls, Bufffood and all this stuff. All this "trash" might be trash, but you can sell them and you get tons of them. You will never lose completely, you will always get a decent amount of gold (in trash) back (relatively to the bag's price.
---
The thing with trying to win is also the realization that there's no point in trying because BG have a map queue flipping everything in SEA and EU time and have t3 everything by NA...
---
That's old BG, and why nobody wants to win against them. Every other server wants fights or easy ktrains but BG still operates like they care about winning. But if you don't actually get anything by winning, screwing around on siege wars for hours is actually unfun. 
---
Talking about pre-exodus (before mounts) BG: it's 2019, if there's 10 bg in t3 smc and I have 20 people I still won't bother going in. I'll just go fight the other server, because that allows everyone to have fun and not run their heads into a wall. I could go take t3 smc but there's no point, especially since after I log they'll retake it soon after.
---
Right now BG has low NA and high off-hours population (check wvwstats). Means they blob when less are on and stubbornly defend when more are. Still boring, if I had a choice I'd play the matchup without BG.
---
It's not a super intuitive UI element, so it's easy to miss, even after a long time.
---
I need to see the pricing.... cause right now people have had a whole month to farm gold to gems, I got 800 saved up which is only 300g and I dont feel like crunching for gold.
---
I could probably throw 10 bucks at the game that has given me probably 500 hours of game time in 1 year to boot, I play gw2 more than any other game and I've thrown money at them.
---
It does seem limiting but shit ain't free yo, I get where the devs are coming from but when I started gw2 i didnt even know dps meters and templates existed, so for a ton of the open world folks this is probably a huge qol update... it does seem a bit predatory but I dunno, 
---
Either way a lot of the community told them to monetize it so they did, now people are mad because the free one was better.
---
I wouldnt want to pay like 3000 gems for a total unlock... but I'm also a guy that at most has had 6 builds for a single character, and a lot of those could probably be consolidated because I'm not a mega min maxer.
---
So I'll probably see which account unlocks are best before going for character unlocks in specifics (this is one part I dont like, all of it should be account unlocks) but I get where they are coming from...
---
I wouldnt call it predatory marketing because this game ultimately doesnt have a sub, so if you arent throwing 15 USD at them every month you are already saving way more than pretty much most of the other good mmos out there.
---
Coming from ffxiv to boot, expensive expansions that are only able to be bought via cash and a cash subscription, the grass isnt always greener on the other side.
---
If you can it's nice to chip in some coin for the amount of entertainment you get out of this game, if everyone actually did that instead of just whales they probably woildnt have to rely on these methods of monetization.
---
Horror movie - and party ! Don‚Äôt farm to much kinds :p
---
You assumed everyone saw that tiny button hiding in the corner?
---
I've been yelled at for opening doors when I was only one of two people on a map late at night. Like, dude, I didn't even know anyone else was in the lab.
---
He don‚Äôt need tooth xD why would he \_o_o_/
---
No.
---
More bags gives more chances to roll for super rare stuff, but it's still entirely RNG.
---
Either just open them as you get them, or save them and sell them.
---
Or save them and open up a ton at once to make managing inventory easier.
---
That, and may RNGesus be in your favour because the shit that's worth anything is rare as.
---

Honestly I didn't even see it because I am too busy doing the adventure thing.
---
 In short! 
---
1. With PoF you get HoT! So you will have 2 expantions 
---
2. You are able to play all specs and classes which is important if it comes to wvw/pvp/pve raids etc.
---
And the story is really cool !!! 
---
3. You get items at the beginning which helps you to start more smoothly into the game. 
---
Even if you dont play the game that much - its worth it
---
You sir, just made my day!!!
---
Actually nice skins
---
They aren't personalized ToT bags you've been using are they?
---
No its up to commanders to remove their LFG posts when they know the map is full.
---
We ask for it every single year, have been asking for seven years. Never got it, never will. Pro tip: scroll down. The further down, the bigger your chance to get an open map.
---
ArenaNet avoids to present any indicators that would allow people to estimate active player count.
---
 sure there is an asura whos going as Ant-Man
---
And presumably, as a feature the playerbase has been requesting for seven years, it would be monetised?
---
I used Jackal for 2 of the hard turns - in the middle of race and at end and.
---
Exactly what happened to me with the Grothmar skimmers before I realized there was a special action boost. :P
---
Someone tell them a way to monetise that and we will have it by the end of this month
---
As far as i know in LFG you can see squads. Lab squads are usually not full, while at the same time map can be, as there are ppl who are not part of the squad. LFG is not showing full or semi full maps. So its on commander to remove his squad when somebody notify him/her that map is full.
---
So he has to reup it everytime s/o jumps out?!
---
wow rude
---
While you get both expansions with the PoF purchase, a thing to keep in mind is that you are still missing around half the story content with it, along with an array of related world areas (one per Living World episode in seasons 3 and 4). If you care at all about story, buying these is almost mandatory to have a coherent narrative.
---
I don't remember the exact cost of all available seasons, but it was somewhere between 30 and 35 euros I think. Most veterans got them for free by simply logging in around their release so often the living world is overlooked in answers to this type of question.
---
I tag up for plenty of these. But, if I'm not tagged and we're waiting for 2 people who are standing still on the map because they decided to salvage some trash in their inventory and sell their Trick or Treat bags you better believe I'm smashing that door.
---
or just " -[ " is enough 90% of the time.
---
What value did posting this bring to the subreddit
---
You rly think people are gonna jeopardise an opportunity to sell a raid by making it easier for players to filter out their ad?
---
even if i would like to have such a thing. i do think it is not possible or just bad, because of two things.
---
1. is there is a soft and hard cap
---
2. there are constantly people joining and leaving a map, so these markers would change all the time and confuse people even more
---
I've always found this claim odd, as Gw1 got released over there didn't it? That, and many other games have done similar, look no further than Mists of Pandaria in WoW for some of that stuff.
---
its on the Equipment panel in the bottom right. Looks like a clover.
---
Personal experience, this is correct. Changed from Sorrow's Furnace to Dragonbrand after buying expacs.

---
Predatory is not related to having a sub or being F2P.
---
Predatory is when they try to monetize everything in the most egregious way. 
---
Which seems what they are doing now with the build templates. 
---
Too many tabs you must buy at the same time to get advantage of the template: 1 tab for build equipment, 1 tab for build skills, 1 storage tab to keep the items.
---
Total: 2000 gems.
---
They could practically sell just the storage tabs and the rest of the tabs be for free as many as you need.

This thread on the forums gets updated daily with new/returning/sales items.

Best I could manage was 1:03:376 I gave up after some tried and decided to buy it for 30 cobs.
---
:-D
---
My main is a theif so I will give this a shot. Thanks
---
Yes but being able to advertise you sell raids still makes your guild known in case someone wants to buy it in the future. It‚Äôs why, when Anet implemented - for LFG, they switched to (sell) or (s3ll) etc
---
Stop stressing and just roll the entire course at purple speed, its the easiest and you'll get under 1 min
---
Try premade configs from d912pxy/configs. Given your CPU, maybe you already have maximum of it
---
Oh boy, pseudoscience. My favorite.
---
Hmm, I have to completely agree.
---
Opened 4000. Got only trash. Such a waste of money
---
Yeah thats too much effort for the average commander
---
dont steal his fashion bro...
---
Why would we want something that lies to us about a party being full when it's 42/50 and still gives us the option to join?
---
I don't want this to exist ever.
---
Soft cap is reached when people can't join the map by just entering the map. They will join another map, even if they are in the same group, guild etc. If you want to join a soft capped map, you have to join via "join map xyz". 
---
Hard cap is reached, when the map is actually full. When you try to join tha map via "join map xyz", you will get a message, that the instance is full. Hard cap for Mad King's Labyrinth is at 25 Players afaik.
---
Found my PUG.
---
This!... Especially the 2nd item
---
Care to elaborate on how sellers try not to be filtered?
---
Yes, and your comment doesn't address the concept of companies using politics all the time in order to pursue their profits.   All you did was put conditions on the situation and then proclaim that one small-in-scope instance doesn't justify the means.
---
So huh?  Are you saying that Pride-themed merchandise (which is at-scale btw) and Nike Kaepernick ads justify the means unless it's done at an esports tournament (and not just any esports tournament but one done at a large scale)?  Surely not.
---
Raid sellers still use "Selling" in their LFGs, this is just a straight lie.
---
It's easy to miss 'cause it's tucked in with event tracking, and events never have a close option. As far as I remember it's the only button in that area of the screen, outside mobile UI elements and closing the game entirely.
---
But they don‚Äôt only use selling because it‚Äôs so easily filtered
---
Big advise would to to get used to weapon swapping early.
---
Very important.
---
Huh?  Equipment templates in GW1's are available in PvP and not PvE for 24 hours, every single day.
---
What feature are we taking about? Whether the instance is full or not.
---
I would pay a lot of gems for this ... listen to me arenanet, a lot of gems!!
---
That happened to us last night! Our squad nearly wiped twice until we finally got rid of Viscount.
---
This isn‚Äôt meta for farming but on my ranger i typically run longbow (or shortbow) and double axe. it can tag a lot of mobs
---
The Ascalonian Catacombs weapons glow blue at night.
---
Most likely guild members
---
[This useless goddess.](https://i.imgur.com/7Smjo2F.png)
---
Most big events are maxing out the map before it even starts so you need to be early or join some squad and try to join their map if not full. It also depends which kind of events if they are just random small events there wont be alot of people.
---
Usually maps have a cycling rotation. Every 2hours or so there spawns another worldboss or metaevent in one corner of Tyria.
---
There are timers for it on several plattforms, just look up the one from gw2wiki for example.
---
Older maps are populated too, just buy Commander or skill into Mentor tag so your position shows up on the map and people can gather around you.
---
Well as long as your friends don't care about you imposing your fun on their clear times I suppose it doesn't really matter
---
What did it used to be like
---
Good job on that Tyra!
---
50k dps, now its at 30
---
Curious, my roommate was experiencing them not working for her the other day, but the normal ones were. I just figured it could be the same here. Though now I'm not so sure.
---
Went power reaper since ANet made scourge incredibly clunky to play last patch, clear cm and T4s without any problem. 
---
Condi dps scourge is still useful on VG, MO, Carin, and Qadim2.0 pylon kite since they don‚Äôt move too much, other than that.... stay on power reaper until they fix PVE scourge(which might be a 6 month wait, assuming they still gives a shit about necro).
---
how is it working for ppl? mine still shows but the load button does nothing.
---
Meteor shower didnt get weaker after every impact, lava font used to be stronger. Now the skills just feel like they lack any oomph.

I was the new player in this situation. I accidentally pulled that stupid skeleton and ended up running horror movie style through the maze away from it.
---
can confirm. got perma banned today.
---
can confirm. got perma
---
Hello, yes working on it. Thanks for feedback!
---
Hello, I will add it soon with pictures too. Thank you!
---
 mine still works correctly, I can't tell you the difference between working or not.
---
hmm doubts. they dont even give perma bans for hacking, just 6 months
---
I'm wondering, since arenanet doesn't say what program got you banned how does everyone know they got banned because of arcdps? Or is it just an assumption?
---
Money's tight, can't have competition for the "new" feature KEKW
---
they probably had gear check on it but they will never admit it ;)
---
Were you using d912pxy?
---
Did you use the gear checker?
---
When searching "Guild wars 2 approved Gw2 addons" theres no even 1 public open list of anet just tons of users that list "probably" safe things.
---
&gt;  There's nothing confusing about that. 
---
Addon was okay &gt; Daily users that dont seek every forum each day &gt; Perm banned because shitty behavior of Anet.
---
Even then, a perma ban is ridiculous. Compared to other stuff that gets just short temp bans, using now illicit build templates is harmless.
---
If that's true, then this outrage is unfounded; of course you're gonna get in trouble if you try to do something the devs specifically don't want you doing. I think I'll wait for things to unfold before jumping to conclusions.
---
I‚Äôm not on EU but I see HP trains through HoT zones at least once a day, and in the very least just on the weekends. You can always ask map chat for help. 
---
As for PoF zones, a large majority of those are easy enough to solo that having a train doesn‚Äôt help a whole lot. Plus plenty of people are getting them done too. Anytime I run a new toon through PoF zones there‚Äôs 2-3 other people there getting the HP as well.
---
Really? That's ridiculously harsh for something so harmless.
---
Before people say anet is hero company never did anything wrong. REMEMBER THEY BANNED PEOPLE INNOCENTLY FOR HAVING AN EMPTY HASH BECAUSE THEY DIDNT WANT TO CHECK AND THEN REFUSED TO LOOK INTO IT UNTIL A GUY SPEND MULTIPLE MONTHS TRYING TO GET THE FUCKING UELA TO PROOF HE WAS INNOCENT AND THEN HAD A MASSIVE UNBAN WAVE (was from BDGM dps meter era when it got banned so eberyone who even had stuff like CE and similar open got randomly banned even tho they never did anything with the game that was against TOS)
---
Thanks :D
---
Thanks for the tip. Didn't knew that map limit was 25 players. üòÑ
---
More story content, raids, mounts, and pieces of cosmetics to collect.
---
 ahahaha! Knew this would happen. Had a delusional guy on here tell me  smugly that "anet never forbid the tool or banned anyone who use it" so  he was safe to try circumventing the shutdown, guess I knew better and  we won't be seeing much of him in-game now
---
I can try, don‚Äôt know if I can get that time again though, I‚Äôll see to it.
---
Thanks so much! On North America sadly
---
True. But its cheaper not to. And the motto after lay offs is cost reduction.
---
They shouldn't be giving perma bans for this. Especially since those affected dedicated players in the first place, and tend to have benign intentions.
---
But I guess as usual... ANET doesn't care about their hardcore playerbase.
---
Better use proper cheat programs next time. They are way more safe, it seems.
---
Maybe they want to make a statement of these people, so that nobody even dares using 3rd party build templates and everyone has to use the in-game templates. After all they don't want to lose out on money, because some 3rd party plugin offers unlimited free templates.
---
This wasn't random, innocent users. It was a group of players who decided to use a hacked version of ArcDPS. They got what they deserved.
---
&gt; of course you're gonna get in trouble if you try to do something the devs specifically don't want you doing.
---
That‚Äôs not the point here. Are they ethically right for removing a fan-made system to replace it with a paid-for but less functional system of their own? Should they be punishing those that want to use the old system? 
---
Of course they have the right to do it, but ethically it‚Äôs fucked.
---
ahahaha! Knew this would happen. Had a delusional guy on here tell me smugly that "anet never forbid the tool or banned anyone who use it" so he was safe to try circumventing the shutdown, guess I knew better and we won't be seeing much of him in-game now
---
Cute theory.
---
Not really it's just an sql where clause.
---
Depending on how they implemented the system it might not be that difficult to do but 2 also makes it not worth it because the only time people will care about that information is also the time it is most likely to be wrong.
---
Implementing this feature would be trying to solve the wrong problem. Figuring out what the real problem is would be a different discussion.
---
If you're from Europe, submit a GDPR request so that you can get details on your ban and evidence to reverse it.
---
Staff was never good in open world really. It was only ever really strong on big enemies with large hitboxes where you could consistently land all your meteors. 
---
The problem with this kinda design is that it makes it overpowered on single target enemies when it's purpose is aoe on multiple enemies. The damage reductions purpose is to make it weaker on single target, but keep it effective on big globs of enemies like in wvw. 
---
And unless you speed run fractals or raids, the nerfs are still not big enough to affect you, staff weaver is still decently strong on big targets. It's just a bit worse than sword weaver or scepter tempest.
---
200 watching on twitch sure its alive.Oh wait its much more fun to play than watch thats the reason right :D:D:D
---
&gt; your elite skill will be available after these short advertisements (video 1/3)
---
Did few hours ago and just waiting for the answer now.
---
Do your research. You are spouting nonsense. It was never of questionable legality. Delta worked with Chris Cleary to make sure everything was good to go. He green lit it and said if other developers want to make addons reach out to him so they can work out the details. They didn‚Äôt, ‚Äújust look the other way‚Äù. Stop putting your own opinion as fact.
---
And the functionality isn‚Äôt getting replaced in two weeks. People are getting a fraction of what they could before locked behind a triple pay wall per character.
---
That wouldn't provide any useful indicator since that still doesn't tell you how many groups are around and that is still only some unknown portion of the playerbase. If it was implemented it would make more sense to autohide full listings anyway. Nobody wants to have to scroll through pages of full listings.
---
I hope it's not too much to ask but would you be able to show some proof of it, e.g a screenshot. A couple of discords I am in had people trolling regarding that (not that you are) so just wanted to verify it.
---
At this point I believe nobody got banned, but salty snow trolls created this drama and organised people on 3rd channels to spread fake news
---
because casuals dont want such things and cry a lot if such things are used
---
How do you know that?
---
Im too lazy to explain this to you while on the phone.
---
Do you people not know what "ethical" means? You all seem to be struggling to understand the difference between what is allowed and what you should do...
---
ArenaNet are within their rights to disallow a harmless bit of software, but they're ethically wrong for allowing it for years, then taking it way just to charge people for a worse system.
---
I hope they add more sources
---
Just another reason why I quit this horribly run game.
---
obviously man theyre the lowest scum of the earth. not paying for a feature that ISNT EVEN OUT smh
---
From another thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dk7rrv/people_perma_banned_for_using_arcdps/f4bdevz/
---
As long as you are using the official ArcDPS download you should be fine. Using modified DLLs that activate the removed build template feature appears to be giving perma bans so do not use it.
---
Going to leave both threads up as they were only made minutes apart and this information needs to be seen as the better chance for people to see it the better.
---
How so? They informed you arc is temporary measure 4 years ago. I see no moral dilemma here.
---
Who gives a fuck if you accept the rules. It's still unethical.
---
How do you guys not understand that there is a massive difference between ethics and rules.
---
Extreme case using your logic: I guess it's OK for third world countries to execute gay people because their law says they can do it and the gay people knew what would happen if they had gay sex. I mean, they knew the rules long before right? The rules were always the same since they were born right? Therefore they can't be upset for being executed.
---
yeah perma ban seems overly harsh. Just ban for a month...these people werent trying to scam the game or anything.
---
500 gems for a "queue" skip/guarantee entrance pass?
---
You and everyone else agreed to not use Third Party software. 
---
It's not like it is hidden information.
---
This exaggeration is just sweet.
---
This tells you how Anet really is a POS, moneu hungry company. In PvP players hack, chest, win trade, take gold or cash for wins/losses. They have players share accounts to get them rewards they couldn‚Äôt otherwise get. They have bots that play 3,000 + matches a season making thousands of gold, they have hackers in WvW and PvE (there‚Äôs a guy on YouTube and Twitch creating videos of him winning the mad kings race and clock tower by teleport hacking)... and none of those even get a suspension and yet they perma ban these people.
---
So if America announces that they're changing the law in 4 years time to kill all those who have gay sex after 4 years, that's ethical?
---
Extreme example but it's shows the flaw in yours and everyone else's logic here...
---
What about people who are just lazy and didn't update arc?  Is this banning people for not updating a 3rd party add on?  That's pretty fucking low if its the case.
---
And you have people on this sub holding Anet as some kind of benevolent saint that out of the pure kindness of their heart allows us to use a few select third party mods.
---
Not an exaggeration. It's showing the flaws in your logic with an extreme case. It's the easiest way to show the difference between what is allowed and what is moral.
---
Its bad example because anet didnt change rules
---
That. Doesn't. Make. It. Ethical. To. Ban. Those. That. Used. Harmless. Software.
---
Which btw, I have never used :)
---
And what about the people who just didn't update arc? Has anyone confirmed the previous version still works or not?
---
I do understand that. What i don't understand is that people are trying join squads with 20+ ppl in the lab. If you join squad with ~10 ppl it will fill fast and there's no need for waiting. :) i mean i know that you know that im just saying generally... :)
---
I don't know but there could have been bans. But since I have not seen any evidence that they were banned exactly for that ....
---
I mean arenanet doesn't say which program did get you banned and most times they don't ban directly.
---
Yeah can confirm this, a few guild mates got banned
---
The only thing it shows is your lack of common sense, entitlement and drama hungry attitude. And the fact you dont know contract rules.
---
But, official build templates won‚Äôt be implemented for another 10 days, so there‚Äôs no reason to think you can‚Äôt use Arc templates
---
You're the kind of customer corporations love. Easily manipulated and lacks understanding of basic concepts.
---
This pasta's already moldy. Stop it.
---
ARC was approved. There was no pre/post removal. ARC was approved. Now people are finding out it isn't in the typocal ANet fashion: Ban first, react to outrage later, react poorly, make more people leave the game.
---
Having consistent rules doesn't make something ethical. Oh my god.
---
What if your country has always executed gay people? Is that now ethical.
---
... I don't know how I can make this easier for you people.
---
Fair reasoning, but I dislike how they balanced this weapon. They balanced it by making a skill that should feel like a hard hitting skill, feel very weak. They took the fun out of it. 
---
Meteor shower in gw1 felt impactful, very high damage and caused knockdown. It felt like a rewarding skill to use after a long cast time. It felt like a nuke. In gw2 pve theres pretty much zero reason to use it outside of big hitboxes and even then it just feels like an average dps skill, nothing super hard hitting.
---
Squishy class + 4 second cast time + root in place should mean big payoff, and it's just.... not...
---
Using the regular, deactivated build templates .dll. No ban.
---
Don't use workarounds to keep illiegal hacks up, kids.
---
But the in-game templates *aren't even out yet*.
---
just more of the same, and not even much of it
---
I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoKxCoEYlIY) a few days ago getting the achievement, it's not a great run, but maybe it'll help.
---
Just strictly speaking from the facts
---
&gt; Be Anet
---
&gt; Allow working templates with unlimited space and customization
---
&gt; Release shitter version and force people to pay for space
---
&gt; Even after paying for max space you still get less space than previous
---
&gt; Perma ban anyone who still has old version installed
---
Absolutely insane rofl
---
the arc build templates stopped working on the 15th if you updated or not. delta had a kill switch built in.  
---
looks like the people who were still using it had a modified dll to enable the templates still.
---
&gt; ARC was approved. There was no pre/post removal.
---
Except the thing that people who got banned were using *was not ARC*.
---
&gt; This was a modification to re-enable a lost feature.
---
How does that saying go again - "give them an inch and they'll take a mile"?
---
You are wrong - in the same post where Cleary announced they allow arc templates, he said its temporary measure until first party solution is introduced. It was announced 4 years ago.
---
The Chinese Communist Party was unhappy that ArcDPS offered something Guild Wars 2 doesn‚Äôt. So they banned it!
---
On a more serious note, ANET and the CCP have a lot in common, almost like they‚Äôre the same entity. Censor this, ban that. Anything to shut people up. 
---
#AnythingGoesNET
---
no
---
Yea I think that happened to me too
---
They're really not that subjective in the west.
---
I mean, people who use teleport hacks in competitive modes don't even get permanent bans. I guess money is job 1, though, and it's not like WvW or PvP make any.
---
&gt;Either ban everyone using any game modification (arc, taco, fucking DX12 compatibility layer), make a list of approved ones with specific versions, or allow them all.
---
This isn't a grey area case. If you used a bootleg version of ArcDPS, you were aware that the developer intentionally killed the program to not run into conflict with ArenaNet and you knew the reason why he did.
---
What I mean is: The in-game templates aren't out yet, so anet shouldn't be perma-banning people for using arcdps templates... *yet*.
---
That‚Äôs good to know, because I‚Äôm the procrastinator one that hasn‚Äôt bothered to get around removing the dll. I‚Äôll do it... tomorrow.
---
Pity the players that got banned, I understand that modifying the dll is bad, but atm there isn‚Äôt even an alternative. Perma ban is too heavy handed on these dedicated players.
---
The only content they implement properly is the tuesdays gemstores updates.
---
At least I found it funny. Bite me.
---
This is true for HoT time trials as well. I had this happen to me once there.
---
Of course they are. People living next door can have different morals to yours, probably not that insane to compare game bans to gay murders, but still.
---
He's obviously not using the example as a 1:1 of human rights violations.  It's a hyperbolic rhetorical device to demonstrate how the sentiment "rules are rules" doesn't inherently justify those rules.  You're straw manning in order to ignore that.
---
I think it was a joke on the ignored botters/hackers in competitive modes.
---
So why people accepted those rules 4 years ago?
---
This is the heavy weight on those using unsupported 3rd party tools.
---
They will always carry a risk, and that risk only increases if you don't stay up to date with any news.
---
exactly, that's my only point. why did they ban now instead of a week after they released the official build templates?
---
A lot of people seem to be upset when blizzard enforced their rules recently
---
oh look, [the guy who told everyone to "stop feeding the troll"]( https://reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dhspu0/arcdps\_build\_templates\_to\_be\_disabled\_tomorrow/f3qvr0k/?context=3&amp;st=k1xynhh1&amp;sh=886518d7) has come to... do what exactly? try and be consistent, dear, nobody knows whether to take you seriously or not. (but thanks for making my flair get a +1)
---
Exactly.
---
Good job anet for banning the 3 ppl that still play this game.
---
I'd be willing to fight this, they haven't released their own build templates so there is no reason why the arc-bt shouldn't be valid anymore.
---
did they announce the bans? if not then there's even more a reason why to fight this. mistakes happened on arc side in the past, wouldn't wonder if some people didn't get the kill-switch flag or got the wrong internal version.
---
I remember quite well how they told him to remove the gear check function, he told them he did, but then had both the gear check and none gear check version available for download on his site.
---
Yup, greedy fucks honestly, they need to sort this situation out once and for all, the wishy-washy hints that mods are ok but then perma ban your core playerbase for it is inexcusable.. particularly when its removed because they want to monetize it haha, come on.
---
Didn‚Äôt someone go through GDPR for similar stuff?
---
https://massivelyop.com/2019/10/10/guild-wars-2-studio-arenanet-chased-the-2016-gaile-gray-account-hacker-all-the-way-to-germany-and-lost/
---
Steve...the corb.
---
Well if you go out of your way to deliberately use a version that is not TOS compliant I don't have any pity for you.  
---
No matter if you think it's a big deal or not. If it's against the rules that's YOUR problem.
---
The rules that [explicitly allowed us to use arcdps, templates and all](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/704oem/build_templates_actual_release/dn0eys7/) for the past 4 years?  Do you know anything about the history of this issue or are you just spamming this thread to troll people?
---
People have suggested it because [it has worked in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aktctr/more_information_on_arenanets_mistake_in_april/) for a previous ban wave of Anet.
---
&gt; ethical
---
Are you all missing this?
---
I have heard people saying that they got banned despite not using this hacked build templates DLL at all. This means they might have gotten banned for using any number of other add-ons (d912pxy, TacO, ArcDPS, GW2 Radial Mount, etc etc). Or it might have been a false-positive ban from whatever system they're using to dish out the bans.
---
It's hard to verify the claims and know exactly what's going on.
---
I will say though that I doubt ArcDPS on its own caused any bans considering ArenaNet explicitly gave it the green light. The previous unupdated version of ArcDPS's build templates should not work either since delta implemented a kill switch for them that works regardless of whether or not the players update their version.
---
Warrior, Ranger, Necromancer. I suggest playing necro because it is one of the best and easiest class to play. Core (free to play) necro at the moment is very very tanky and you can do most things with it. I don't suggest playing elementalist, mesmer, guardian, revenant, and even engi. These classes are a bit harder to play at first. Good luck !
---
The rules that clearly said its a temporary measure to be removed when first party solution is introduced.
---
Got to protect the gem market
---
Engineers are good but not the greatest (still good) when it comes to dps in pve. It's already one of the most complicated classes.
---
No sense arguing about this any further. You support ANet, I am against ANet, nothing will change here it seems. I think ANet's lack of communication is abhorrent, I hate the way they treat loyal players with permaban first, ask later treatment, I absolutely think their "feature" is a half-assed cash grab, and the only way I would have accepted this as even close to justified was if there was an official statement beforehand making it clear that ANet will, going forward, no longer support this feature.   
---
Players finding out in this way that a feature they used without issues is suddenly bannable is bullshit, I won't change my mind.
---
Which it isn't, yet.
---
The build templates should not still be working for people that haven't updated. Mine stopped working the day delta said he'd disable them without me ever updating Arc.
---
they can't detect Taco or radial mounts as they don't interact with the game.
---
Even worse is they didn't even release templates yet lol
---
I could go on and on and on about the inches I've given ANet as they broke promise after promise after promise. At this point I don't give them the benefit of the doubt and if something feels fishy or looks bad, I just go with the default assumption that ANet is fucking up again, not communicating, and being random.
---
I said what I intended, just as I said that templates exist in both pve and pvp. That you're still upset about my phrasing and timing is ludicrous, but continue
---
No announcement was made before bans happened. People use old versions of software all the time, and never in the past 4 years has someone been banned for using an outdated version of ArcDPS. 
---
They could have said "use the latest version or you will be banned." Instead they said nothing.
---
&gt; My point is it's just very hard to verify the legitimacy of all the allegations and figure out exactly what is causing the bans.
---
yeah, stuff like this happened in the past, that people cried about a ban and then a dev posted a video of the recorded positions. (speed/tele hack)
---
It's modifying an addon not the game.
---
ArenaNet gave ample warning 4 years ago that they had plans to add official templates. QoL has been monetized for a long ass time, it's the whole basis of Legendary stat swapping as opposed to having to carry around multiple sets.
---
Well I mean that‚Äôs why Anet and the developers of these mods all state in bold: **Use at your own risk**
---
You might not like it, but when you use mods for anything, even single player titles that explicitly allow them, you will always get the warning that you use third party software **at your own risk** and that nobody will be held accountable if anything goes wrong as a result of it‚Äôs usage.
---
Personally I don‚Äôt use any mods with GW 2 specifically because I‚Äôve poured a lot of time into my account and I don‚Äôt really want to run the risk of fucking that up for a little bit of QOL convenience. I don‚Äôt want to assume that risk so I just don‚Äôt use third party software. This isn‚Äôt like Skyrim where I can mod my heart out and the worst that can happen is it breaks my game and I have to reinstall it but my save files will still be there or I can spawn in any items I worked tirelessly to get before and don‚Äôt feel like getting all over again.
---
A week ban and the message "Remove illegitimate software" probably would have sufficed.
---
Doesnt even have to be the same time again, just the route would allrdy be interesting.
---
I've heard that people who've got old versions of the templates plugin (officially released, but old enough not to have a killswitch) are getting banned too though.
---
Honestly mobile games and Korean and Chinese companies have ruined gaming with shitty monetisation. They paved the way for shitty western companies to follow.
---
Casuals don't want you to be able to look at their DPS or inspect their armor.
---
So your 2nd friend forgot to update his arcdps and got banned for it?
---
Such a slimy fucking move from Anet.
---
&gt;If you're not going to pay us $20 for this feature, we will just perma ban you
---
&gt; My bet is that NCSoft is pushing an aggressive Asian-style monetization strategy and people at ANet have these annoying things called morals.
---
Putting anet on a moral high ground like that to describe them as if they are innocent in this outcome is not something I agree with. Not sure if it was your intention but fact of the matter is they're fucking a lot of things up as a company. I have no doubt that there are a lot of great and morally sound people that work and have worked there but blaming NCSoft isn't the right way to go about it.
---
You
---
Changing gear is easy.  If they keep the chat codes ability to share and change builds, one could easily make a script that copy/pastes codes from a text file with the push of a button.
---
Even if they were using modified version of ArcDPS a permaban is still way too harsh.
---
If only they were as quick to ban all the bots in PvP...
---
Nothing you can do but wait.  I have 1000mb/1000mb fiber connection and still get 5mb on average.  USA east coast.
---
Its literally still one of if not the highest dps in wvw outside of dragonbanners if played well specifically because of how well meteor shower cleaves downed players and people standing in it.
---
This doesn't make it better, but I wouldn't be surprised if the push for such extreme monetisation came from NCSoft rather than Anet.
---
Yeah, i got the point. But asking for the tool in game cos they are uninformed is silly. :) At the end of the day, that is Looking For Group tool, not an indicator for the full map. I just wanted to say that. :)
---
Not much has changed since late 2017. There are a few new badly designed fractals, and a big pile of nothing. Better go to archeage/final fantasy
---
&gt; never in the past four years has someone been banned for using an outdated version of ArcDPS. 
---
Has this been confirmed? Are we sure people that used the hacked version are not misleading us with this statement?
---
That's why I said it seems like this is what's happening. I have seen Reddit comments from people who don't even use templates or haven't even been playing the game for the last 3 weeks also getting permabanned though. Everything is up in the air until we get some kind of official response.
---
It's amazing how reddit dismisses so quickly anything that doesn't fit their whiney circlejerk.
---
Have you actually watched his masters series? It's him doing in game content that you likely missed about 95% of the time. The gold doesn't affect the stream very much, and hell, you can even play with him while he gets it all done
---
Once you realize the time it takes to get all the unique PvP, WvW, and Raid skins you'll realize how quickly that gold argument falls flat on its face. Not to mention the huge amount of unique and hidden vendor content from various events and whatnot.
---
Here we go again, Anet is above having any fault whatsoever. Its all NCSoft with their greedy hand up Anetd arses and speaking for them...
---
Do you have to buy living world chapters to get the skyscale?
---
Like the other person said seeing the route and knowing how far away you can get away with collision for checkpoints as well as where you used the griffon and raptor would be cool
---
hardcore community? this was still a thing?
---
It should be mentioned that many people caught in the banwave don't even use Arc, so it might just be a coincidence that some people using it got banned.
---
Does anyone really think casuals will quit in droves if people who want it can look at dps and armor. WoW retains many many casuals with the ability to look at armor and dps.
---
Pray tell why you're alright with banning and locking such a useful feature behind a pay wall. Rather than it being something people more generally have access too without needing to sink further money into something that should be part of the baseline game.
---
&gt; you make it sound like ArcDPS was an official add on. It wasn't.
---
ArcDPS is an officially allowed addon. Arenanet employees have commented on this multiple times on their forums. The developer worked with Arenanet to make sure it was allowed. Having the killswitch for templates was one of the Arenanet requirements to allow the continued use of ArcDPS. The killswitch was enabled 2 days ago. Shortly after, somebody hacked ArcDPS to remove the killswitch and started distributing the hacked version on various discord servers. Using that hacked version to get around the removal of templates from ArcDPS is why people are being banned.
---
"It's against the TOS"
---
A previously allowed program is now against the TOS because the same functionality is being sold as gems.
---
So, so glad I'm testing megai's addon loader for use in the addon manager so I don't have Arc in my configuration (yet), guess I inadvertently dodged a bullet. Sucks to hear that ppl got banned, particularly those using unmodified versions.
---
In this instance the creator of Arc disabled templates already, \*someone else\* reverse engineered his files and released a \*hacked\* version to circumvent the disable, which people then had to go \*out of their way\* to download and install the hacked version. This puts the willful disregard of the rules on all of those people as well as the person who released the hack, it just seems that individual(s) has kept a more low profile instead of flaunting it like bgdm's creator did.
---
Now, that's not to say their crappy solutions might not have also nailed some false positives in the mix, they aren't the most competent when it comes to this stuff as we all know, but in general the people involved took deliberate action themselves to violate ToS whereas it could be argued some people could be unaware of bgdm's illicit gear check since that was added by the creator not the user.
---
They specifically asked for the functionality to be removed. If you then go out of your way to reimplement it you're asking for trouble.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
It's a shitty situation and completely unnecessar.
---
There is quite a high chance that, rather than purposely perma-banning people who use arc templates while waiting for official ones, out of spite ; it's more like the fact that templates imply automated interaction with the game and is detected by anti-cheat system making bans automatic ... Detection probably had a specific exception for build template related actions (or arc) and that exception was simply removed when it became irrelevant ... Leading to this situation.
---
Keep this thread at the top of the sub as long as possible, and I think we can hope for a manual action on their side to revert those bans ... along with an official warning that automatically changing gear or skills is now back to being detected in the same way as any other botting action and that you should stop doing it right after the first (and last) ban revert action.
---
&gt;  pay us $20
---
you'll need more to actually have useful templates.
---
There's "at your own risk" where 3rd party add-ons may cause your game to stop working, steal your passwords, ransomware your computer through no action of the developer, and then there's "at your own risk" where you get banned for using a previously allowed add-on through explicit action of the developer.
---
That would explain so many people leaving Anet.
---
Is AutoHotkey a problem? I use it for a Path of Exile Trade Overlay and usually don't bother to turn it off when I switch to playing GW2. May this be any Problem in the Future?
---
And they're Perma banning people who brought back the old ArchDPS capabilities.
---
"Tyrrian Group Discerner"- this magical pendant allows you to tell the times and seasons, and discern whether there is room in the realm for you. 200 gems for two weeks, 1,000 gems permanent.
---
its so baffling because you could just missed all the news about buildtemplates/end of arc templates and logged just to be permabanned.
---
It‚Äôs not really an argument of ethics tbh, it was unethical to use third party software to give yourself an advantage that players who do not use such software wouldn‚Äôt have just by playing the game. That‚Äôs why third party mods are usually generally against the rules in MMOs in the first place.
---
Was the ban ethical? Technically it was, because it removed rule breakers who are technically abusing the system when you look at it objectively.
---
Is it awesome that they got banned? Arguable, I personally don‚Äôt like people who use hacks and they technically used a hack, but let‚Äôs say no. But they knew what they were risking when they used third party software, or they should have, because it‚Äôs right in the TOS, the TOS that they broke.
---
If someone was banned in the past for using an outdated version of ArcDPS, we would have heard about it. 
---
Only after the current version of ArcDPS was updated to remove Build Templates have bans occurred for users using older versions.
---
I wonder how many people use d912pxy and arcdps. I've noticed some people saying they've never touched arcdps but used stuff like TacO and d912pxy.  I can't see them knowingly banning TacO, however I do wonder if d912pxy could look like a hack/botting program (and cause people to get banned by an over-zelous employee) since it (if I understand correctly) intercepts and converts anet's outdated and obsolete dx9 calls into dx12.
---
I was more trying to imply that not all the people who got banned for what seems to be "using a modified template DLL" actually used this modified DLL because Anet has not really been stellar about the precision of their bans for these matters. So it would not be surprising that some people got wrongly flagged because Anet has already been overzealous in the scope of a few ban waves while claiming they were sure of their decision only to overturn quite a few bans after some players got out of their way to do a lot of analysis and research to clear themselves.
---
And nowhere did I say that those that got rightfully banned for using this modified DLL didn't deserve it (even if the duration looks a bit harsh given the context imo).
---
You can eat it (eat 300 for an achievement) but it's best to save up 1000 and exchange it for a candy corn cob (or to just sell it on the trading post, depending on if 1000 candy corn is more expensive than 1 cob). Cobs are currently about 4-5 gold on the trading post. 
---
There's a bunch of things from vendors for candy corn cobs, most of which are miniatures that follow you around. (Check the trading post for these, though- some of them are *not* worth their cost in candy corn.) 
---
If you have the expansions, you'll probably want to sell the cobs for gold or save them for a mini. If you're free-to-play, though, you can spend 3 cobs to get a 20 slot bag (the Halloween pail). 20-slot bags are about 10-12 gold on the trading post, and the Halloween pail is about 12-15 gold in candy corn cobs right now. It's a really easy way to get a 20-slot bag without crafting, though.
---
Not saying anet shouldnt punish people, but a permaban seems way too harsh for just using the discontinued arc templates.
---
Im having a hard time grasping this issue as a 5 year GW2 I‚Äôve never really used ARCDPS. So correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. 
---
But as I understand ARCDPS is a Third Party App or Program that allows feature like Build Templates among other things? And ANET are perma banning people now they have their own Build Template feature even though when it came to ARCDPS before the Build Template Announcement, ANET turned a blind eye to it as it violates Third Party T&amp;C. 
---
But now their banning players under the guise of violating Terms and Conditions?
---
Am I on the right page?
---
This will most likely be an egregiously unpopular opinion, but monetization is important for an MMO that is otherwise mostly free and provides ample opportunity to turn in game gold into cash shop currency. 
---
A game needs revenue to survive, so of course they‚Äôre going to find a way to monetize one of the most requested features. It‚Äôs a guaranteed revenue stream, and though it might be annoying to some, they‚Äôll pay it. And the game will be able to continue providing content as a result. 
---
Plus, I would rather have QoL upgrades monetized than core mechanics. Charging for extra build templates isn‚Äôt going to make the game play to win.
---
Power reaper is not terrible in raids, it is reliable and offers a lot of utility as well as very good cc, just not top dps. Scourge is strong when epidemic is strong or for kiting pylons on Qadim2 but otherwise somewhat lackluster.
---
Same thing support team response time to tickets.
---
Problem with actual game play? 2 week response
---
Can't buy gems? &lt;24hr resolution provided
---
Reports are there for people getting banned for using non updated arc dps or other hooks atm.
---
My fashion perfectionist trait makes me tremble at the sight of the **white** dye for the pumpkin dye channel....
---
_**Why not orange like the rest of the colour accent???**_
---
Any time any of the MMO giants enforce any of their rules that they‚Äôve let slide for a while, people pull out their pitchforks and form an angry mob. 
---
Why people would use mods, knowing the risks those mods carry, with both the MMO devs **and** the mod devs explicitly stating that **you use third party software at your own risk** is beyond me, especially when it‚Äôs people who put a lot of time and possibly money into their accounts. 
---
It‚Äôs kind of like buying a nice car, taking it to a mechanic buddy of yours to add mods to it that are of questionable legality, and then getting super mad when come next inspection, your car fails and you‚Äôre not allowed to drive it on public roads any more.
---
I *very* much doubt that would be a problem. The ban wave I was talking about allegedly banned people for having software like Cheat Engine running in the background, which is explicitly used for game hacks unlike AutoHotkey which can be used for all sorts of things.
---
On top of that, the people that were wrongfully banned during this ban wave (just for having Cheat Engine running in the background without ever using it for GW2) were later unbanned as far as I can remember.
---
I obviously can't speak for the company though.
---
I use it to macro instruments. I know macroing instruments is allowed,  so I would also like top know if it's specifically auto hotkey or macroing for real.
---
How much Anet pay you to type that post?
---
Probably because its a feature that is *free.*
---
That goes way back, I still have a few of the old blade radio DJs on steam, I'll send them a link to here and see if anyone knows.
---
I‚Äôd be fine with them monetising them if they provided a better system than what ArchDPS provided. Going from free superior build templates to monetised inferior ones is the problem I have with it. If the official templates were better then I‚Äôd have no problem paying for them, but they are objectively worse than ArchDPS ones in every way
---
Hi ElectricMatrix! I was wrong, Balthazar emerged in LS3. As to the question of whether Balthazar was going to kill Primordus then and there? No one knows for sure. Even Taimi admitted during "Heart of the Volcano" that she didn't understand everything that was happening.
---
Maybe Balthazar and Primordus aren't reflections of the same element, fire? But you made the yourself in your reply. Balthazar and Primordus both work with fire.
---
Perfect descriptions of each. It's refreshing to see someone who actually knows what they're talking about instead of just bitching about nothing. This subreddit could use more of this.
---
Arc is still approved. Once you modify the software to serve some other function than the dev intends though, it's no longer Arc.
---
I want to know this too
---
That's because bots indirectly increase their revenue and unofficial build templates take away from it.
---
And how was your friend who didn't play for three weeks know that he'd get permabanned for this. Anet is foolish.
---
Thats not even the case. The feature isnt even out yet. If it was out and you get temp banned I can understand, but perma with the feature not even out yet is ridiculous
---
Solution seems simple to me: make a better product. Or keep banning people and losing the trust and loyalty of the community over a simple quality of life add on.
---
AHK can be a problem, but i havent heard of any specific bans because of it. personally i almost always use "capslock up::setcapslockstate, off" because i am tired of accidently shouting in chat.
---
The developers have said, many times in the past, that build templates was an incredibly complex inclusion. Given how badly wanted they were, they probably had to cut corners to get something out the door, but they are trying to give players what they want.
---
Give it time, the functionality will improve. Patience is a virtue when it comes to new mechanics and the like.
---
This one was pretty clearly communicated by ANet.
---
Granted, I think the perm ban is extreme, but we've known for months that Arc was going to remove this, and adding it back would be against the rules.
---
AFAIK, it was just an older DLL that previously worked, nothing had been changed.
---
Quit shilling dude
---
Being the single highest damaging skill in the entire game is not big enough impact? Sure it doesn't instantly wipe an entire enemy zerg, but then again no skill does that.
---
&gt; The previous unupdated version of ArcDPS's build templates should not work either since delta implemented a kill switch for them that works regardless of whether or not the players update their version.
---
Well if you don't update the dll at all, maybe you can still use them. I know ingame, I can still open the template window, and the load button seems to be available (though I won't try clicking it now...). Maybe clicking it (if it actually works) can lead to a ban? I wouldn't try it anyway, but that would be without using the modified dll, simply not using the up-to-date version.
---
Arenanet's stance was clear, and Delta was forced to disable templates and said that they were not to be used. 
---
Permaban is super harsh, but taking that risk was stupid. Never try to outsmart a gaming company who holds your account by the balls when monetization is involved. Anet are not our friends, we are their customers.
---
Technically the Arc Templates work in the sense you can still view the builds you already saved I guess? Or at least they were for me even after updating the main dll. I was getting crashes so I had to uninstall it.
---
Except people didn't get banned for an outdated version though.
---
Except it was just an older DLL? AFAIK, that was all that has been used, I haven't seen any "illegal modified" versions, it was just swapping the current DLL for a previous one that worked. Imagine coming back after not following the game and getting instantly banned because of it.
---
&gt;modified .dlls 
---
Wasn't it just an older DLL?
---
I‚Äôve yet to see any concrete proof of this. It‚Äôs all a bunch of anecdotes so far.
---
It has little to do with ethics.  This is a terms of agreement, this is the difference between legal enforcement of laws and use of software.  You do not choose to be born in a country, but you must abide by its laws, that is a much greater area for ethical deviations.
---
This is a terms of service agreement, it equates to saying, "yes, I understand these are the rules I must follow to use this software, and I agree, yes, you can stop providing this service if I break the rules."  This is an agreement that you knowingly enter into.  This is an agreement that you risk disrupting when you use 3rd party software. That is why this is not an *unethical decision* from arena net.  
---
Is the penalty harsh?  Absolutely.  
---
Is it a bad PR move?  Absolutely.  
---
Is it unethical?  No.  They laid out terms, people knowingly and willingly agreed to terms, people knowingly and willingly broke the terms, they revoked the agreement.
---
Exactly. I am not sure that any of the alternatives would be all that much better - stuff like a hard cap on the number of meteors that can hit a target would feel worse (lol they stand in meteor shower and take no damage!), and balancing around its best use case be downright awful (coefficient 1.6 -&gt; 0.64, woo).
---
Players just really liked it overpowered is what it comes down to.
---
I know you‚Äôre upset, but honestly being hostile isn‚Äôt adding anything to your argument.
---
1. Some arenanet comments in random threads on the forums or elsewhere doesn't make for an official company position on allowed add ons. That you think such a system is satisfactory and tenable in letting players know how they may modify the game is telling.
---
2. That you think it's appropriate at all for ArenaNet to put such restrictions on a player add on, solely because they have their own system coming in -- which they are charging money to use to a full extent which does not meet the QOL of this player add on, is also telling.
---
‚ÄúAt your own risk‚Äù means ‚Äúat your own risk‚Äù it‚Äôs non-specific for a reason. It means any number of things could happen due to usage of third party software. It could even include but is not limited to: false flags, mod developers making changes to their mod that no longer make it okay to use those mods (you can‚Äôt expect Anet to keep a close eye on every little change made to every mod they have nothing to do with.) it could mean a mod that **was okay** was shut down and then a hacked version was brought back and that version is **not okay** and now you‚Äôre being banned for that. It could mean Anet changes their mind about a mod because it does things they weren‚Äôt aware of when they okayed it, so now it‚Äôs not okay.
---
Just because you‚Äôve been using a mod for a while without being banned, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll always be okay to use that mod. Most players don‚Äôt want to assume the risk so they don‚Äôt use **any** third party software. Just remember from here on out, you use third party software at your own risk. Anet says it, **the mod developers themselves** say it, maybe it‚Äôs about time you start paying attention. Even the Dev for Tac0 has it in bold text on their own site. You think the Tac0 dev is talking about crashes and being hacked and all that noise? No. They put that there because they‚Äôre aware that their software isn‚Äôt official Anet software and users could be subject to bans if Anet decided they no longer wanted to support Tac0.
---
Oh, and in this case we already know that the final product's quality will be utter crap.
---
What if I told you it was far deeper and far more sinister than you could imagine? Ask yourselves, what has happened in the past year at GW2? What trend have you noticed in the pvp and wvw populations? The queues, mATs, and promised features? Have they worked as promised? What has suddenly influxed nearly every game and every wvw match? What about that news about Gaile Greys account hacker. You really think hes some greyhat? That he acted alone.
---
See, I've tried to warn the entire game community about what is coming. But I admit I am not the best individual suited for this role. My entire gw2 experience, I was more of a villain to all players. So ask yourself what type of threat would convince someone to attempt to save the same community they did not like in the first place?
---
Do some research. All of you. Google search "gw2 hacker reddit" and the first post youll see is from Winter 2018. Ask yourself why people are banned not just for arc dps, but for reporting a SPECIFIC group of hackers. In such a way that silences the truth. Many have the ability to come here a speak about this arc dps debacle. The same freedom cant be afforded to the only individual who made contact with this group of hackers. Go find the thread and ask these questions. You arent't going to like any of the answers.
---
Hell, the designer of build templates left quite a long time ago.
---
Nah never that but usually 1000 other things that dissuade the user from coming back.
---
&gt;The people who got banned had installed a ~~hacked~~   older version of ArcDPS to get around the killswitch that shut off templates.
---
FTFY.
---
"Illict"
---
Aka, you're now using a service we want to sell you that you got for free.
---
Well apparently I got banned on both my accounts and I don't even play the game lol? I haven't logged in since before the arc changes and I login once a week at most to check tp for 10 minutes. I have at most 1 hour of playtime a month and don't even have arcdps. Something else is going on here. :/
---
Yes, you need all of them for the achievements.
---
or make a statement that the old version is not allowed anymore (yes even a hacked version is still a version)
---
Your conspiracy theory is showing.
---
This game has become a fucking joke.
---
Yeah honestly, Anet super vague 3rd-party application page is just so fucking vague it hurts. They don't want to put clear lines because then some people will try to find a thing that is just wrong but technically still on the correct side of said line. But then it means that they basically have a very rough shape and then decide what is ok based on what they like and that usually is not something that gives me a lot of trust in such a system :p
---
I didn't even know what this program does, but it sounds like a good Idea. No more 7GG
---
A year ago before the "consume all" feature was introduced to many more items, i used AHK to put left click on mouswheel. Following 1 button = 1 action rule i never faced sny issues with that
---
That "Use at your own risk" was in regards to the tools malfunctioning (i.E. switching gear deletes it), not Anet deciding to ban you when they feel like it.
---
Say you haven't logged in in a while (because there is nothing to do) and return to find yourself banned. You didn't remove the template before your hiatus and upon logging in, the server notices the .dll and terminates your account. I removed the Arc weeks ago and I am fine but I have yet to get in touch with guildmembers who certainly did not remove it.
---
&gt; Soft cap
---
when a map softcaps players without a party won't be put into the map anymore. if you are in a party you can still access the map though (either you land there directly or can join on your party member.) and it seems there is 2 types of softcaps -  a map which is just above the softcap will let you in immediately but a map near hardcap will force you to use the join instance function.
---
Hard cap youre right
---
I think people would be happier if build templates were feature complete from the get-go (even if it takes longer), rather than getting some half-finished product shoved out the door with the saying that "Next patch will fix it!"
---
Players searched and applied a modification to arcDPS *because* they knew it would be killed on Oct. 15. They had to be aware of that new rule in the first place to even think of actively trying to circumvent it.    
---
Now, I think the whole decision against ArcDPS templates is bullshit, but you can't argue that those players didn't know exactly what they were doing.
---
I do agree that mentally off many WvW players is poor, but I don't necessarily fault them since Anet doesn't really support them. If the mode is completely community driven and players have moved to play in their own ways, it's not unrealistic to expect players to play with conflicting goals or motivations. 
---
Like if people were in it for the ganking or roaming, then warclaw would have made it less fun for them. I'm not a personal fan but I can't blame them since it's their way to enjoy a directionless mode. 
---
In the same way I'm not really about siege wars if there's no reward for doing it, some might think that it's the way the game is meant to be played. Ultimately both can be right as Anet doesn't encourage either and it's down to players to find their own fun. 
---
The only thing I'm really disappointed by are the players who say one thing but do the other. Like they say they are in WvW for the fights but then avoid them, or only fight with overwhelming numbers, etc. It just makes it less fun for everyone that shares that similar mode of enjoyment in WvW.
---
Wrong. The killswitch has been in place as long as templates have been in ArcDPS. They did not just install an older version.
---
The big post on this has several people posting their screenshots.
---
thats a lot of text to say nothing substantial at all
---
&gt;What if I told you it was far deeper and far more sinister than you could imagine? Ask yourselves, what has happened in the past year at GW2?

---
You can check out [gw2launchbuddy](https://github.com/TheCheatsrichter/Gw2_Launchbuddy/releases) if it still works, you should be able to select the server which you download files from and it shows the ping to each server.
---
Yeah, monetization is needed for a post-box price source of revenue for GW2. Doesn't mean it has to be this, though. Any claim that it *has* to be this is ridiculous in face of the history of the game lasting this long without them charging for build templates.
---
It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the players who would desire build templates the most are probably the smallest portion of their community. If you're in need of monetization, you need to aim for the largest overlap in your audience, not target a small niche. And definitely not in a way which feels restrictive as opposed to freeing. And absolutely not in a way that is dramatically less effective than the free option which was available for years.
---
Focus is only decent for condition oriented builds
---
No, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense is all. Is it ethical to kick a guest out of your house for drinking the toilet water? It‚Äôs not really ethical or unethical, you just know that you don‚Äôt want toilet water drinkers in your house because they‚Äôre weird. That person‚Äôs family will probably be upset that you kicked that person out of your house for something as benign as drinking water out of the toilet, but that doesn‚Äôt mean your decision was unethical. Had they just asked for tap water, you would have obliged, but the fact that they didn‚Äôt bother to ask, and just went ahead and dipped into your toilet water makes you feel uneasy, and isn‚Äôt behavior you want to tolerate so it‚Äôs well within your rights to kick them out... ‚Äúbut my dog drinks the toilet water in my home all the time, I wouldn‚Äôt kick my dog out for doing that.‚Äù Yeah and? I still don‚Äôt want humans drinking out of my toilet, I don‚Äôt want my dog to do it either but he lives here so all I can do is say no when I catch him in the act and remove him from the bathroom.
---
Where do ethics come into play there?
---
alright, I understand. good write up
---
and my guess is that with the lab you get the most candy corn?
---
This is amazing, well done! :D
---
i was getting crashes too, so i removed all addons (except ardps metre) and played vanilla to see where the crashes were coming from. i didnt even know there was a hacked templates or i might have tried it and gotten banned, thankfully i'm good.
---
Point aside, this thread is just here to create some drama, please consider removing it because it really serves no other purpose, especially as long as we don't know the full extent and reasons of those bans.
---
I had no idea.
---
Another out of touch and ridiculous move by Anet. We were due for another one.
---
What kind of graphic settings do you have? as far es I know the preview window uses max settings and different lighting.
---
For years, I didn't know this, thank you!
---
Players need to learn not to use mods/addone in an online game what does not officially support them, so they must be teach in the hard way. Breaking ToS is breaking ToS.
---
My guild is a WvW guild, so yes that has kept me around for years. 
---
Outside of WvW, I do everything else solo.
---
It's a good mix. I prefer to do content on my own, but I do love my guild in WvW.
---
i see no alternative right now that replaces the build templates right now? so its still needed
---
Thread removed: Re-posting is not allowed.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)

Be careful with that, maybe anet will ban you like they are doing with people firing up old ARCDPS build template DLLS.
---
Source that Arc was the reason for the bans?
---
i don't even know why i am laughing so hard at this answer but yeah have my upvote :D
---
Wow, Harry Raider seems like a cool guy
---
If you don't update build templates (the dll) and update the actual arc's main dll... Yeah I hear it just works.
---
Funny that.

More replying to point 1 rather than 2

Someone said "i'm ban, must be because of Arc" proceed to post on some site, then reddit copypasta and spread the "news"

Except he's had that long before this series and without donations. (handling large amounts of currencies) His opinion on build templates, (like it or not) was his same opinion long before he started any master series.
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.

I'm not sure if you saw my entire message.

In short, it's not needed people have been raiding for years **without it**.  It's a convenience addon but it's **not needed or required to raid.**
---
I used neither arc nor templates for the last months and got banned.
---
Wow, It's almost like they are *trying* to alienate their hardcore players. People getting temp bans for this is one thing but, perma bans on first offense? Seriously? I guess they want to continue their fine tradition of defying our low expectations and proving that they are even worse than we thought.
---
that is, at least in part, because there is no proof of teapot himself ever using it. his stream consisted of other people's point of view, and his own (main) account was logged in to the hall of monuments for the entire event.
---
There are more maps that have problem with LFG map joins and a solution like that would apply to all of them. What you're proposing works only for this event.
---
I agree this is harsh. I would say a 72 hour ban and then perma if they do it again.
---
Yea, not like the Harry we know of.
---
Exactly... The official version isn't here yet, so why cause the drama?
---
wait so anet allow addons with build templates, and say they are legal. And now suddenly without warrnings they change rules and permaban people?   
---
  
---
You cant make things like that. Official templates are not even in game yet so people cant make argument that using something to avoid paying gems is against the TOS.    
---
This is why anet should have NEVER allowed addons. Now the rules are a mess , and we have a shit situation.
---
You do realise how big of a group of people who will say they are banned even though they are not to make a case out of it right?
---
Depends what you consider an average person is right. Newer players would be in the minority with the game being 7+ years old. Most people, being those that have played for a few yrs, can probably comfortably scrounge up 2k selling their mats / converting acc bound currencies. gw2e says there are ~6k ppl running around with ~3k raw gold so I'd imagine that number is much bigger with mats/currencies taken into consideration
---
\[The problem is far deeper than us vs them on both sides\]([https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aekrul/hacker/](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aekrul/hacker/)). Believe it or not we are all fighting together the same enemy. A virtual war against gw2 was waged almost an entire year ago. Atleast you all can spread awareness about the arc dps ban wave. But there is a far deeper problem that we arent even allowed to discuss on reddit.
---
Go figure, they are getting banned for using something they shouldn't be using and they know it. 
---
Thanks for the correct information rather than OPs post.
---
This happens all the time. It's nothing new. Social media and consumer culture have turned everyone into hyper sensitive drama queens.
---
That's possible, but hopefully people will be serious and help the community instead of being selfish
---
Let's start with correct information then:
---
Active template .dll here, not updated since the deactivation, no ban, dan still access my template UI, seems like I can even save templates. But can't load any anymore.
---
Not banned.
---
or a queue like wvw so I don't have to try and spam join for each of them.
---
Have you read the answers in the threads? Does it look like serious people to you?
---
How do you intend people to find out exactly why they've been banned, whem Anet won't tell them?
---
They can only guess.
---
Why shouldn't they have been using it? Why do we need to settle with a shittier version that they are trying to shit down our throats when there is (was) a better option out there? This is a fucking scumbag move and ANET should fucking die in a fire, such Horrible company, I love GW2. Loved\* they killed the game and enjoyment for me. Pathetic move on ANET part, all they care about is money, sad fucking shit this is.
---
*puts bunny ears on raptor*
---
What stop em from lying?
---
Exactly
---
That's how I had it on my laptop, nothing so far. Couldn't use it with the updated arc. Got rid of it since it didn't work.
---
Did he have an old version of arc's templates installed? Or other add-ons like d912pxy?
---
Good lord there is a lot of "fuck Anet, this game sucks, greedy SOBs, etc. etc." First off IT'S THE WEEKEND, Anet isnt even working today. Second, if it was an error and the ban doesnt fit the punishment (as it appears to be) then give Anet to chance to respond and fix it. The subreddit has so much hate that common sense has been thrown out the window.
---
Exactly, people can only guess, and yet people keep claiming that the reason for their ban was Arc. Not that they GUESS that it is the reason, but that it IS the reason.
---
Ok, I went and read through your other comments.  I see the point you are attempting to make but ironically, I think you actually misunderstand what programming code of ethics is.
---
In many cases, you use hyperbole to draw comparisons to obviously unethical systems in which people are forced into - such as legal conditions of countries.  Like I said earlier, this is much more rife with ethical considerations.  Being born into a system of law is not the same as terms of service.  Comparisons between them does not make sense.
---
Programming ethics is generally about the same thing most other codes of ethics are about...  Not doing harm, not being deceitful, not plagiarizing, being transparent about legal or conflictual interests in work, adequate testing, debugging and quality assurance of sold software, not using software engineering for financial misdeeds (such as laundering, bribery or embezzlement), and lately, many professional organizations for the representation of legitimate software engineers include sections on privacy and confidentiality.
---
Arenanet has not broken any of the code of ethics with templates.  Perhaps with Black Lion Chests in potential exploitation of those with medical gambling or addiction disorders as well as the inability to fully perform quality assurance on paid software.  But releasing a new function to replace a third party software is absolutely not unethical, enforcing terms of service when the terms of service have been breached is also not unethical.  To suggest otherwise is foolish.
---
If you would like to demonstrate how this is unethical via academic text or professional code of ethics, I'll happily shut up; however, as someone who also went to school for and now works as a software engineer, I am not a stranger to these situations and personally if we had an employee that broke agreements of hiring, a joint venture parter who violated contract or a customer that misused our products, I have absolutely no doubt that we would do the same thing Arenanet has done here.
---
Nope. Older DLLs for build templates either had the kill-switch that delta implemented or were old enough that they wouldn't function on this version of the game. The one people on the SC discord got banned for was a modified templates DLL that was *specifically designed to circumvent the October 15th killswitch*.
---
Because...
---
&gt; Pretending to keep politic away form anywhere is politic
---
You thought such a comment can be ignored.  To which I said you can't separate profit motive from politics because you seemed to not understand how the two relate.
---
Blizzard did what they did because they're trying to expand their share of a market that has a certain political opinion on an issue in order to increase profits.  There is no difference between what Blizzard did at that tournament with what they posted on their twitter during gay pride month (https://twitter.com/blizzard_ent/status/1134509599208484864?lang=en): using politics to pursue profit.
---
Wouldn't it be awesome if monday comes and we get an announcement from Anet that they finally gathered enough proof against the 1000 biggest PvP cheaters/hackers (that people keep whining about) and issued bans to all of them this weekend? :D
---
It's a reasonable assumption if that's the only modification they have used and that have no other possible hack programs
---
If only we could dye it, but as it is it blends a tad too much.
---
Only thing I can think of is a firewall problem
---
A version of core ArcDPS (not even the templates DLL) from 3-4 months ago won't even function in the game.
---
I say only this, is not first time that they banning wrong players, and it's certainly not last time. I for sure don't believe that they ban only guilty players.
---
And there is a PvP topic as well where bots just exist.
---
Wow dude, I don't have any opinion either way.  I'm downvoting you for being a massive prick.
---
I use TACO and the mount wheel... I'm in danger too?
---
Also, so far this community has been pretty bad about "hype". It's always blown hella out of proportions and then people are all disappointed. So I'll disagree on the "we need some giga level hype" part.
---
today on things that will never happen: this will never happen the most :D
---
And yet there are people reporting getting banned WITHOUT having Arc as well. Fact still remains that people are just ASSUMING things.
---
Who are you lying to right now?...me?...people reading this?...or yourself?
---
"Ludicrous, but continue!", says the person who keeps responding whenever I say that equipment templates are only available in PvP in GW1.
---
The previously allowed program is still allowed, but nonfunctional, because one of the conditions of that program being allowed was the developer implement a killswitch. That killswitch has been flipped, so official arc template DLLs no longer interface with the game.
---
The program people were banned for is a modified version of that DLL, that was designed specifically to circumvent the killswitch.
---
&gt; how does a version 3-4 months old know exactly the date to disable the feature? 
---
He probably asked devs for specific lane of code to be added in game files long time ago to be activator for killswitch.
---
&gt; permaban is still way too harsh..
---
Totally agree and I wouldn't be surprised if these bans are upheld to set precedence to everyone that undermining ArenaNet's monetary strategy has a zero tolerance policy.
---
They do bans on hackers and botters in waves (which is actually VERY logical)...because they can ban more people that way. Especially if they identify a way to detect a specific piece of 3rd party program.
---
I anticipated news from Anet but not like this.
---
Less than Blizzard is paying you to try and make their competitors look bad
---
What? anet bans people even if they dont have a modified dll.
---
They really want to squeeze every penny out from us with those inferior build templates without any  compromise.
---
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!
---
I didn't play the last month's.
---
Blizzard did what they did because it looks bad for a company to support political beliefs of any kind, see nike and Gillette and what not. Now tell me, how is gay marriage political?
---
thats not what happend
---
And now that people are getting banned, the same people who said that there's no way anet would ban people for using arcdps templates are going to say that people should have saw this coming because they were warned ahead of time.
---
&gt;the build template part of arcdps got disabled for me without me having to download anything from delta
---
When was the last time you updated it? As I said, my friend played last on mid-april so his build is earlier than that, probably from the last time it broke before that date.
---
lets not forget how inferior this system will be for the people who actually **needs** templates
---
who watches mmos on twitch
---
since day 1. i dont care too much since im playing once a week max because of my job. still its sad too see that i get banned for nothing lol.
---
yeah not even 100 bucks will be enough to get the 25-40 builds many are using here
---
All ill say is that no matter how irresistable you may find it, do not make purchases on their servers. Nothing done in game matters, but your money should. Keep yourselves safe. The coming months will only shed more light upon my vague responses. The moment i give into the urge to tell you all just how deep this goes, is the moment we lose. Everyone else cursed with this knowledge has long since quit. I operate only in the best interests of the community
---
I have no idea man, all I know is that last week is the first time he came back to the campus and he just got on discord with me as soon as he could. The game started and ran perfectly, we had been farming until yesterday without doing anything that required arc, so maybe he didn't notice it had broken. I'm 100% certain he didn't log in or update the plugin before then because, well, his pc has been here 10m from where I'm sitting for the past months.
---
Bans happen in waves, can happen months after an incident.
---
&gt; a permaban seems way too harsh for just using the discontinued arc templates
---
Permabanning is still a bit too harsh, but it's not like they're banning people who "just" left arcdps installed. They're banning people who consciously hacked arcdps to use the templates that had been purposely disabled. If there's one thing that's crystal clear about ArenaNet's stance on 3rd party tools, it's that you don't use what ArenaNet *explicitly* disallows. Arcdps templates were disabled as per ArenaNet's orders, so punishment for hacking them back on was inevitable.
---
from what i'm reading, templates was disabled in preperation for Anet implementing them directly into the agme. the bans were for those that used a previous version of the arcdps templates somehow, after anet stopped allowing it to be used i think, whether it's a perm ban or a for a period of time, only anet knows..
---
Good point, mate. I guess the original point that I was making is that Balthazar was attracted to Primordus first. He didn't go after Kralk first, or Bubbles first. He started with a sphere of magic with which he is familiar.
---
Honestly as it stands I doubt anything can or will save this one.
---
The fact that it seems to also affect people who have not logged in for months would very much suggest it is NOT Arc, despite people assuming so. It is quite possible that it is something that they have been keeping an eye on and compiling for quite a bit of time, and simply pushed the button now.
---
people are getting perma banned no matter if you use a modified version or not
---
The fuck I just see?
---
He had whatever was working on april 12th, only arc, no other plugins or add-ons. He also goes on long hiatus from the game because of burnout, so his arc might even have been broken since then.
---
Maybe Anet should fucking deliver for once instead of blaming the communtiy for getting excited..
---
When the killswitch happened, mine just completely stopped showing, despite updating arcDPS. A few friends of mine still had the window but it didn't work, pressing hotkey for window just didn't do shit to me. Neither me nor any of my friends that used arcdps (+templates) got banned.
---
it is also harsher punishment than they have previously given which is strange
---
if youre left handed shouldnt you already have this sorted out already, why is this only coming up now?
---
As far as I have understood, it's only for the traits that you can copy codes, not gear ....
---
Yeah, had the exact same experience. Finished with 1:00:000 and got gold but no scarf. Had to do better than 1:00:000.
---
No, there was a modified dll being passed around without the template killswitch, not an older version. Older versions either don't work or have the killswitch active.
---
I don't see a firewall causing slower speed. If it was a firewall problem, it would display connection errors, or block at 0kB/s for all or some files.
---
I have a question about the upcoming **build templates feature**.
---
In GW1, we had build templates for skills/stats etc. and equipment loadouts we could easily swap. However, the skills templates could only be swapped in/out when you were in a town or outpost, and not during missions or out in the world.
---
This was important as it meant that GW1 didn't have an expectation that players would optimise their build per-encounter; i.e. if you were going to do the *Thunderhead Keep* mission, you needed to have a build that could handle the whole mission; you couldn't switch up builds mid-mission (you could only switch weapons).
---
Are GW2's templates going to be swappable any time out of combat? As I'm concerned about a situation where groups start expecting players to bring highly specialised gear for very specific encounters in, for example, fractals. Like people start expecting players to change equipment for each encounter.
---
Do we know how this is going to work yet?
---
probably not, but to be save i suggest removing every addon until the dust settles
---
No the regular raid cadence is like 9-10 months, wing 7 is actually the easiest wing to date
---
People keep saying PvP wouldn't be alive without bots, yet for me the reason i stopped PvPing was entirely because of bots. 
---
The reason this game became a one-week-per-patch is because the thing i'd do in down time would be grind pvp. Can't do that vs bots. Just isn't possible if you wanna stay sane. It breeds apathy and cynicism among the PvP community and actively kills it.
---
There is no excuse for having bots in competitive game modes. The fact that the apathy and cynicism has spread so deep that it is a general consensus at this point that ArenaNet allows the bots to exist is in itself proof that they do more harm than good.
---
&gt; That's because PvP bots indirectly increase their revenue
---
How?
---
You think it‚Äôs appropriate to call the authorities for ‚Äúhacking‚Äù in a video game? Wow. (Hacking is used VERY loosely here).
---
indeed, I did say that. you still seem quite perturbed by it
---
have it installed, played yesterday and nothing
---
only if it would be monetized
---
what kind of proof do you even expect?
---
Banning dx12 users would kill game. Outrage would be too large to contain.
---
Also used the pre oct 15 version. Templates were able to be created, modified and viewed (hovering over it). Loading didn't function (load button grayed out, not working).
---
No ban here. Removed Arc for the time beeing, just to be sure.
---
If I wanted to play classic WoW, trust me, I'd have been there day 1.
---
For better or worse my tastes have changed over the years and Blizzard is not serving up anything for me besides the War 3 remaster - so totally different genre. Unless it's a single player game I can one and done, I'm a lot more casual with my playtime.
---
There's not really anything like this game in the market, that's what kills me about it. The closest thing is maybe Destiny but that's a whole different beast. ESO is great but Zenimax needs to get their shit together with balance, performance, and monetisation before I'd reconsider investing in it again. Crowfall looks promising but that could easily fall flat and never go anywhere.
---
I'm sort of just stuck on this ship worried that it's already hit an iceberg.
---
Yeah but you‚Äôre in hP so odds are you used Unf, let‚Äôs not lie here
---
I understood their decision if it were because of the modified .dll for Arc.
---
If the bans are random or for a reason we are not aware of, then obviously can't have an opinion about it until we know more.
---
Hopefully Anet does something to fix this. Multiple accounts that aren't even active anymore got banned.
---
&gt; deliver for once
---
I found the last two maps and the last two PvE mounts fantastic.
---
Just popping in to report that I've been playing for a few hours today with ArcDPS chainloaded with d912pxy, whilst also running ReShade. I've been running with this setup for about 6 months, and I haven't been banned (yet).
---
I've never used Arc templates though.
---
I don't know you, so I was just relating to not playing part
---
This community likes to pride itself on being "friendly" but spends almost every waking moment shitting on Anet and everything they do, whether they deserve it or not
---
Me and mye friends ( 6 other) doing exactly the same. GW2 feels more and more history now than ever.
---
an addon that hooks and modifies the game files.
---
If it makes you feel any better, about half of 14's livestreams are "heres what we're going to talk about next live letter".
---
&gt; or radial mounts as they don't interact with the game.
---
Isn't radial mounts loaded directly into the game as well?
---
I knew when NCSoft gutted the ANet staff with the layoffs that this game was going to shift to micro transaction hell. They are going to bleed it dry and at best run on maintenance mode like GW1. More likely it's gone the way of City of Heroes and the rest.
---
Praise new raids i mean strikes, they are our future now.
---
Hopefully the perma included fractal tryhards complaining about DPS in a game mode that doesn't punish you for lower than average dps.
---
More accurately, this ship _is_ an iceberg: melting amidst a changing climate.
---
Proof that someone using NOTHING but the version available for download from delta, current or previous, preferably with verifiable MD5 hash values got banned.
---
For every example of overzealous false positive there are ten examples of people coming here, making allegations of a ban for no reason, only to be caught out for breaking ToS.
---
Are we supposed to just take everything everyone says to be truth? Cause word on the internet is you're a pedo, should I just assume that to be true?
---
You have to check yourself if the mods you are using are approved. If people use an unsupported templates hack and get banned it is hard to be mad a Anet.
---
what does this even have to do with me?
---
my understanding it was the templates part of arcdps that was not allowed. yet someone chose to update it to make it work anyways. since anet said no, it's breaking their TOS. hence those using it getting banned
---
Good thing Kralkatorrik didn't corrupt that thing while he was busy munching on the Mists, right? That'd have made Dragonfall a lot more intense.
---
Did you read all of five words into my post?
---
It casts such a creepy shadow too. Brilliant work!
---
it's that you don't use what ArenaNet explicitly disallows... right. 
---
lul. Laughs in speed hacks and flying under the WvW map for 5 years?
---
You want proof that companies can be decent to their customers? Lmao.
---
It could be a gold selling banwave. A lot of people who sell raids coincidently used arc templates as well.
---
Thanks :D That was so unexpected!!! I was really surprised hahaha.
---
GDPR gives you access to any personal data about you that company is processing, not just PII.
---
Correcto, there isn't a "real" playerbase left lol.
---
what the fuck?
---
What's megai's addon loader?
---
I never said they were consistent with their enforcement, but just because people can get away with flyhacks in a gamemode ArenaNet doesn't care about doesn't mean that your account is immune to punishment.
---
"But officer, those guys always run this red light!"
---
It really doesn't matter what other people get away with. If you do something against the rules, you should expect to be punished.
---
why do I even post in this shithole.. I gave you my informations, do with it what you want. I will wait for an response from anet. enjoy.
---
No. You don't foster a good relationship with your community by permanently banning players for harmlessly prolonging their use of a templates add-on through an unexplained gap between unofficial and official build templates.
---
&gt;when just said exactly what they are supposed to NOT do
---
But they didn't. All they said was that Arc's build templates are intended as a stop gap until the real templates are introduced and that they're given the green light. Then, delta announced that he would be disabling the templates as of Tuesday, two weeks before the actual release. Nowhere did ArenaNet warn people that they would be permanently banned for using Arc's templates from there on out. It was *assumed* that ArenaNet probably doesn't intend us to use any templates at all in this two-week gap, but no warnings or clarifications on their stance were ever officially released.
---
&gt;You don't want to create precedence for this kind of situations, for whatever reason.
---
Except the ERP organised by MightyTeapot was knowingly permitted by ArenaNet despite it using a third party camera hack. ArenaNet also make a ton of exceptions regarding their stance on third-party add-ons, such as allowing overlays, allowing macros for in-game musical instruments, and the obvious big one being ArcDPS being allowed.
---
Let's face it, third-party tools have always been a grey area. Using a previously permitted plugin for a couple of weeks longer after it had been disabled by the developer with no official word or warning from ArenaNet is hardly anything to write home about.
---
It took you almost 2 weeks to reply, and this is all you came up with?
---
If Anet are banning people for using a previously specifically allowed addon when their own templates aren't even ingame yet and when the addon will no doubt be rendered inoperable anyway then simply saying fuck anet is mild.
---
Okay but please punish people who ruin my pvp experience. I could give a fuck about a template
---
Thanks
---

---
I stopped playing pvp because dev team started balancing only for silver and bronze player, if even that. Anet never cared about competitive PvP past vanilla - it was all about expansion sales and appeasing PvE players doing their dailies.
---
The thing is though - Ive barely been playing guild wars recently - never mind checking official forums and news. I only heard about arc templates being shut down recently in a reddit comment. I logged in today to see what was new; so what was stopping me naturally redownloading arc templates after seeing official ones havent been completed yet?
---
you cant excuse arenanet for this
---
Anet is trying to make amends for trying to juggle development for two new games and dropping the balls. Their social credit with NCSoft got too low.
---
This was specifically allowed.
---
Oof, seems I‚Äôve hit a nerve :/ Or did you not realise just how many people knew how much hP exploits and hacks?
---
Nope not for another 10 days
---
I'm not saying it's okay. I'm saying *no shit* people got banned for breaking the rules. That's how breaking the rules works. That doesn't mean I think the rules are good, or moral, or whatever.
---
If they valued their accounts, they would have complied, then protested. That's all you can do in private systems like this, because the structure of power is dictatorial.
---
100 gems per category and it's yours.
---
I've been using it since runescape in like 2011. You can actually make some pretty neat shit with it. When OSRS came out I made this script to basically fully complete a lap of the pollniveach rooftop agility course with a simple keybind. Still works as long as you center your camera and start your mouse cursor on the first object you interact with at the starting point. https://pastebin.com/NcEU1H1G
---
There's a lot of potential with it.
---
the friendly part of the community is ingame, the toxic is here
---
Calm down, "big boy".
---
I feel the same way 100%, but you shouldn‚Äôt really expect a new loading screen from a halloween update
---
Also not banned, used build templates until they were disabled (even tried to use them after they were disabled, but obviously it didn't work)
---
Also have reshade, d912pxy and arcdps
---
Tell him "git rekt"
---
That's big brain
---
That's legit terrifying. I saw message from people getting banned for ''modifying files'' when they are only using things like launchbuddy or their Nvidia software options. Anet is legit losing their shit for money. I'm not playing right now because I need to finish some work but I will need to check if I'm banned or not since I used in the past ArcDPS and I sometime use the Nvidia option in Gw...
---
Sorry, but what did people expect? Delta removed the feature for a reason. Who the hell thought reactivating would be a good idea? Of course you are going to get banned, and honestly you should always treat a possible ban as a possible perma ban, harsh or not, it is a possibility. So outrage about it happening is just stupid, being annoyed about it being perma is separate and worthy of talking about.
---
As harsh as it might sound, it's their game, their code, their property... They can do with it and set the rules they want. I didn't use ArcDPS so I have no stake in the whole debacle all I am saying is: if they decide to ban people for having spotify open while playing their game, and they mentioned as much in the ToS like "no custom music is allowed to be played while playing GW2" you would be shit out of luck as well.  
---
I know this is a stupid comparison, but all I could come up with real quick.
---
Calling them "addons" out of custom from games that do have addons won't help the case.
---
GW2 does not have addon support. They tacitly tolerate some 3rd party applications, but they always come with a risk, and players are responsible for that risk.
---
My record is 51 seconds. I was in the top 50 for a few days. I spent more time than I'd like to admit shaving milliseconds off. Jumping off your beetle at the last turn and boosting into the orb and over the finish line is more time efficient with the added bonus of being able to reset with full endurance.
---
Because it's not supported and is publicly banned by Anet. It's pretty simple to understand why.
---
Also you realize that Anet barely breaks even lmao. They aren't a greedy company at all.
---
It wasn't that exactly. He had two versions, one with gear check and one without. The one with gear check was to be specifically used for the Chinese version of the game, and the one without for the version we play here.
---
The real reason was because he never actually removed the gear check function instead he hid it. People were able to "unlock" it by creating a file containing the password in the same folder as BGDM.
---
That's fair! I had similar thoughts when I was writing up one of my responses to you. It took the form of my mention of some higher level of safety against the fires of Primordus vs. the others.
---
anet is a garbage company and I can't stand them
---
This was the case before build templates were a thing. Its why we the gear checker wasn't allowed or why there was such hesitation about allowing dps meters. Anet didn't want people calling out others for their gear choices or their dps.
---
Give it a break and come back to it tomorrow. I noticed doing that seemed to make it easier for me to get more of those close calls the next day before I finally got gold.
---
You're very close! Don't stress out.
---
"What stop em from lying?"  
---
"What stops them from telling the truth?"  
---
No one stops anyone from doing anything.  Your question is vague, anyone can tell the truth or lie at anytime.
---
This is the kind of stuff that makes me not want to play this game anymore.
---
I wasn't specifically talking about the raiding community. You can have casual raiders and hard core raiders too.  Have you been in PvP?  WvW.   
---
This is just a comment on human nature. The more the need to "win" the more likely people are to blame others, lose patience with others. 
---
This can even occur in open world PvE, in areas where people spend time setting something up and it fails. The more competitive something is, the more time you have to invest to beat it, the more seriously you're going to take it, the more likely fights will break out, the more likely tolerance is going to be lower.
---
Don't see many arguments at the great jungle wurm in Caledon forest. Seen a few in AB when the meta fails.
---
On the one hand, I feel ya. Staff Ele hasn't been good in FotM or anything in ages.
---
However, staff ele is one of the best (and only) ranged AoE classes, and with the speed of most mobs, and ease of kiting in GW2, it destroys overworld PvE. It's not a high dps class, it's not a high utility class, it's a class that literally can't get hit by 80% of enemies. Is that an argument for it being this weak? Seeing as it gets zero FotM/Raids play, probably not. But you'd only be buffing something that's already busted in most overworld combat. The class has one big pro, and one big con. I think both are problematic. I assume both are intentional and won't change. Maybe it's time to look for another class?
---
We don't know if _that_ add-on loader would not make whatever spyware thingie that "check" integrity mad either.
---
Or it could be a repeat of "if our spyware couldn't list all system DLLs because you're running GW2 in non-admin user, we just perma-ban you anyways".
---
No need to try to correct this, he's probably referring to a comparison in code and how Lishtenbird wrote it is typically how it's expressed.
---
To be honest if people used some modified version just to use the templates again its their own fault and they are rightfully banned, perma seems a bit harsh, but 6 months would be appropriate so they can think about what they did wrong.
---
I would just stay away from any kind of 3rd party software in the future, what now seems to be "ok" can be bannable in a blink of an eye.
---
Also after telling the owner of the template software to drop support they really should have been clear about it to everyone and say that with the realese of their own solution the software is not allowed anymore.
---
Deliver what? The reale an entire new map every three months
---
&gt;hacking
---
You're illiterately using a scary word to make it seem like people were acting unethically and breaking the game or something. People were further modifying an unofficial player add on, to replicate past behavior and that ArenaNet had allowed for years, and to my knowledge never came out and told the player base that that was no longer allowed. A specific developer removing a feature from a modification they made is not a statement of something no longer being tolerated by the devs. 
---
ArenaNet has never officially supported any add-ons, nor will they. They have always been in a grey zone, with ArenaNet letting people know that some are disallowed either through instructions or bans, while not banning others or giving vague statements that someone (likely) won't be banned for using x add on. Even with these changes, Arc dps' web page warns players that it's not officially supported and that players take responsibility for they do or do not break the game's rules. To my knowledge, ArenaNet never told players that using arc dps' build templates would result in a ban before perma banning players, and have instead simply relied on the fact that they permit themsleves to ban anyone for using any add-ons.
---
And even if this was simply a matter of players knowingly violating the TOS, all of what you said and the above is hardly relevant to the point I was making, which was related to **ANet deciding to suddenly turn an allowed activity into a disallowed activity because it threatened a new source of revenue they're making, which is, by itself, scummy and unethical.**
---
&gt;You seem to have your own agenda you're trying to pull from and it makes you look stupid. 
---
If questioning whether a company's actions are ethical or not is stupid, then I'm all in for being stupid.
---
&gt; Let's start with correct information then
---
This is possible. The only ones who might have "correct" information is Anet. You can ask randoms on the internet for info but you will never know 100% who is truthful or lying.
---
The Lab is where you farm bags. It's likely cheaper to sell bags and buy the corn. The bags have some super rare items that make people like me open lots of bags to gets. 
---
Open some for food and fun, but trading will likely get you goodies faster. There are a lot of good rewards. There is an outfit you can get for 3 cobs. That way you can have a consistent look while leveling and changing armor. 
---
Make sure to buy the Old Pillowcase item off of the TP. It will unlock a collection that will get a you a free mini for things you'll do anyway.
---
Don't worry about build, traits, weapons, what-have-you. Use what you enjoy. Most builds are for content drastically different than what you're playing, so they're impractical anyways. The important thing on the short road to 80 is to try everything and see what you enjoy.
---
Oh! Do note, however, that you'll want to build full power or full condition damage. Power is better because Conditions take time to tick down, but different strokes for different folks. Mix-and-matching is universally inefficient.
---
As an aside, Thief can lose interest very quickly when you realize the most efficient gameplay is spamming your best skill until everything is dead. Was my starting class, haven't looked back.
